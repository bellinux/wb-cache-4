5|$|During the 1960–61 season, Crozier {{spent the}} {{majority}} of his time in the OHA-Jr. Due to his <b>small</b> <b>frame</b> and size, Crozier was not a favourite with either scouts or critics. Despite this, the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League (AHL) recruited Crozier to fill in for their injured starting goaltender, Denis DeJordy that same season. Appearing in three games, Crozier recorded two wins and a 2.31 goals against average (GAA). Crozier returned as the starting goaltender for the Teepees for the 1961–62 season. He also had short stints with the Sault Ste. Marie Thunderbirds of the Eastern Professional Hockey League (EPHL), and the Bisons.|$|E
5|$|Despite his <b>small</b> <b>frame,</b> Brown {{recognized}} Horvath's {{potential as}} a senior in 1942 and made him a regular starter at halfback beside Paul Sarringhaus and fullback Gene Fekete. While Sarringhaus and Fekete were Ohio State's main offensive weapons, Horvath averaged eight yards per carry in a victory over Pittsburgh and scored two touchdowns and passed for 109 yards in a win over Illinois in Cleveland. Ohio State was ranked first {{in the country in}} the AP Poll early in the season, but fell in the rankings after a loss to Wisconsin in October. The team won the rest of its games, however, including a 21–7 victory over arch-rival Michigan {{at the end of the}} season. Horvath passed to Sarringhaus for a 35-yard touchdown and caught another 32-yard touchdown pass from Sarringhaus in the Michigan game. Ohio State's 9–1 record put it on top of the Big Ten standings and in the final AP Poll, giving the school its first-ever national championship.|$|E

25|$|The {{church has}} {{its origins in}} the New Methodist Chapel, a <b>small</b> <b>frame</b> {{building}} built in 1811 {{in the village of}} Kingston at the corner of Wellington and Johnson streets.

Conversely, large framed (or tall) individuals may be quite healthy, with a fairly low body fat percentage, but be classified as overweight by BMI.|$|R

Fisher was employed to teach school for 10 months, {{with a number of}} local worthies, including many active in the Church of Christ, guaranteeing payment of his salary.

25|$|Construction on the Ephraim Smith House began {{sometime}} {{shortly after}} Ephraim Smith's 1844 arrival in Sugar Grove Township, Kane County, Illinois. Smith, a millwright by trade for over 25 years, built the home himself.

The family occupied a small cabin while {{the house was}} being built. Smith's youngest child, Julia, {{was born in the}} cabin in 1845.

25|$|The Episcopal Church {{can trace}} its {{beginnings}} in Scott County to services held in 1837 by the Rt. Rev. Philander Chase, Bishop of Illinois. The services {{were held in}} the hotel at Rockingham, which is now the southwest section of Davenport. In 1841 the Rev. Zachariah Goldsmith of Virginia was appointed missionary to Davenport by the Domestic Committee of the Board of Missions of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States. On October 14, 1841, Trinity Church was organized in Davenport. The congregation originally worshiped {{in the home of}} Dr. John Emerson on Second Street. He had owned the slave Dred Scott, who lived with him in Davenport when it was still a part of the Wisconsin Territory. A <b>small</b> <b>frame</b> church was built on the corner of Fourth and Main Streets. In 1853 the congregation erected a stone building at the corner of Fifth and Rock Island (now Pershing) Streets. The building was built in the Gothic style and included a rose window. It is the first church in Iowa to have a pipe organ.|$|E

25|$|Three timber-framed, {{black-and-white}} {{buildings in}} the village centre are listed at grade II. Marbury Cottage on Church Lane dates originally from the late 16th or early 17th century and {{is believed to have}} formerly been a dower house. The two-storey, T-shaped building has both close studding and <b>small</b> <b>framing</b> with brick infill. Some 17th- and 18th-century doors survive on the interior.

500|$|Since the parish's {{earliest}} years, {{members of}} the Missionaries of the Precious Blood have provided pastoral care for the members; Dwenger {{was a member of}} this society, as were the other five priests who served there in its first decade. The first priest to live in Celina was Theopistus Wittmer, who arrived in 1876; the members acquired a <b>small</b> <b>frame</b> house to use as a rectory. [...] Soon after Wittmer's arrival, the parish constructed a building for their parochial school. The structure built for this school was two stories tall and measured approximately [...] by it replaced a frame building in which the school had started in 1871.

500|$|At the 1956 Winter Olympics, Hickey, a [...] "rink rat" [...] who was {{overlooked}} for {{ice hockey}} {{when he was}} young because of his <b>small</b> <b>frame,</b> came seventh in the 500 and 1000metres speed skating at his second Olympics. He later won a bronze medal at the world championships. Australia's nine other competitors were less successful; two male figure skaters—Allan Ganter and Charles Keeble—placed in the top 15 but in the bottom 25% in the individual event, while the pairs combination of Mervyn Bower and Jacqueline Mason failed to take to the ice after Bower was injured. The five downhill skiers were Australia's least successful entrants; the highest finish was 33rd and the median was 60th, and all were near the bottom of their events. Australia sent its first coach and female staffer for the 1956 campaign; C. Mason oversaw the skaters and Lillian Chisholm acted as the chaperone. The ice hockey team offered to pay their own way to compete; the only thing that they needed from the AOF was formal permission. However, the AOF never responded to their request; they were unable to attend, and criticised the AOF for their disinterest. One of the affected athletes was Geoff Henke, later credited for ending the neglect of winter sports when he became an administrator.|$|E
500|$|After Mitchell {{declared}} for the 2001 NFL Draft, one NFL scout {{told the}} Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel in February, [...] "I don't think he's {{as fast as}} people in the press try to say he is. He's absolutely fearless over the middle but he prefers to trap the ball instead of to extend for it. I don't think he has nearly the explosion {{to be considered a}} first." [...] Mitchell was also criticized by scouts for his <b>small</b> <b>frame</b> and potential character issues. Draft analyst Mel Kiper, Jr. rated Mitchell as the 16th-best prospect in the draft following the NFL Scouting Combine in which he ran a 4.4-second 40-yard dash, and called him a player on the rise. Kiper also rated him as the fifth-best wide receiver in the draft and projected Mitchell to be drafted in the mid-first round following his performance at the Combine. In rating players several times leading up to the draft, Kiper re-watched game film of each player and adjusted their rankings accordingly. In his March 5 mock draft, Kiper projected Mitchell to be drafted by the Green Bay Packers with the tenth overall selection. He ranked Mitchell as the 18th-best player in the draft on March 30. NFLDraftScout.com projected Mitchell to be drafted in the second round and rated him as the eighth-best wide receiver in the draft. Kiper ranked him the fourth-best wide receiver in the draft on April 2. In his April 10 mock draft, Kiper projected Mitchell to be drafted by the Denver Broncos with the 24th overall selection. Ed Bouchette of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ranked Mitchell as the sixth-best wide receiver in the draft. Mitchell hired Tom Condon of IMG Football as his agent leading up to the draft.|$|E
