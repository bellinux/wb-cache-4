5|$|Associativity {{refers to}} the {{observation}} that when weak <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> a single pathway is insufficient for the induction of LTP, simultaneous strong <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> another pathway will induce LTP at both pathways.|$|E
5|$|LTP can {{be induced}} either by strong tetanic <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> a single pathway to a synapse, or cooperatively via the weaker <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> many. When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it {{produces}} insufficient postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli {{are applied to}} many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the postsynaptic cell enough to induce LTP cooperatively. Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may be a common mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity. Bruce McNaughton argues that any difference between associativity and cooperativity is strictly semantic.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of nerve endings in the clitoris, {{the majority of}} which exist specifically for sexual enjoyment, make it the human female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. Sexual <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> the clitoris can produce female sexual arousal and orgasm, and may be achieved by masturbation or with a sexual partner. The most effective sexual <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> the organ is usually through manual or oral stimulation (cunnilingus), {{often referred to as}} direct clitoral stimulation; in cases involving sexual penetration, these activities may also be referred to as additional or assisted clitoral stimulation.|$|E

50|$|One {{equipment}} item of unusual interest was the Vestibular Sled, an ESA contribution {{consisting of a}} seat for a test subject that could be moved backward and forward with precisely controlled accelerations and stops, along rails fixed {{to the floor of}} the Spacelab aisle. By taking detailed measurements on a human strapped into the seat, scientists gained data on the functional organization of the human vestibular and orientation systems, and the vestibular adaptation processes under microgravity. The acceleration experiments by the sled riders were combined with thermal <b>stimulations</b> <b>of</b> the inner ear and optokinetic <b>stimulations</b> <b>of</b> the eye.|$|R

5|$|Another {{option is}} to insert a small pellet of {{medication}} into the urethra, but this requires higher doses than injections {{and may not be}} as effective. Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated.

5|$|Another study {{suggested}} that EFS {{might contribute to}} acute rheumatic fever susceptibility. In this work, {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) from patients with rheumatoid heart disease (RHD) and control subjects that had never experienced acute rheumatoid fever were stimulated with rheumatogenic and non-rheumatogenic group A streptococci (GAS) strains. EFS was one of only four genes with significantly increased expression in both arms of the study: 1) RHD patient versus control PBMCs after <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> both groups with rheumatogenic GAS and 2) RHD patient PBMC stimulated with rheumatogenic versus non-rheumatogenic GAS.|$|E
5|$|In {{secondary}} adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> the adrenal cortex. Apart from {{suppression of the}} axis by glucocorticoid therapy, {{the most common cause}} of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of adrenal insufficiency usually does not affect the production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E

5|$|Locusts are the {{swarming}} {{phase of}} certain species of short-horned grasshoppers {{in the family}} Acrididae. Swarming behaviour {{is a response to}} overcrowding.

The transformation of a solitary individual into a swarming one is induced by several contacts per minute over a short period.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{from cancer}} of the organs, such as the stomach or liver (visceral pain), is diffuse and {{difficult}} to locate, and {{is often referred to}} more distant, usually superficial, sites.

5|$|The CD 4+ cells {{through their}} T cell receptor-CD3 complex {{recognize}} the epitope-bound MHC II molecules {{on the surface}} of the antigen presenting cells, and get 'activated'. Upon this activation, these T cells proliferate and differentiate into Th2 cells. This makes them produce soluble chemical signals that promote their own survival.

40|$|Transcranial {{direct current}} {{stimulation}} (tDCS) {{is commonly used}} to alter cortical excitability but no experimental study has yet determined whether human participants are able {{to distinguish between the}} different types (anodal, cathodal, and sham) <b>of</b> <b>stimulation.</b> If they can then they are not blind to experimental conditions. We determined whether participants could identify different types <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> (anodal, cathodal, and sham) and current strengths after experiencing the sensations <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> during current onset and offset (which are associated with the most intense sensations) in Experiment 1 and also with a prolonged period <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> in Experiment 2. We first familiarized participants with anodal, cathodal, and sham stimulation at both 1 and 2 mA over either primary motor or visual cortex while their sensitivity to small changes in visual stimuli was assessed. The different stimulation types were then applied for a short (Experiment 1) or extended (Experiment 2) period with participants indicating the type and strength <b>of</b> the <b>stimulation</b> {{on the basis of the}} evoked sensations. Participants were able to identify the intensity <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> with shorter, but not longer periods, <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> at better than chance levels but identification <b>of</b> the different <b>stimulation</b> types was at chance levels. This result suggests that even after exposing participants to stimulation, and ensuring they are fully aware of the existence of a sham condition, they are unable to identify the type <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> from transient changes in stimulation intensity or from more prolonged stimulation. Thus participants are able to identify intensity <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> but not the type <b>of</b> <b>stimulation...</b>|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the aspects}} of tDCS {{is its ability to}} achieve {{cortical}} changes even after the stimulation is ended. The duration of this change depends on the length <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> as well as the intensity <b>of</b> <b>stimulation.</b> The effects <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> increase as the duration <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> increases or the strength of the current increases. [...] The way that the stimulation changes brain function is either by causing the neuron’s resting membrane potential to depolarize or hyperpolarize. When positive stimulation (anodal tDCS) is delivered, the current causes a depolarization of the resting membrane potential, which increases neuronal excitability and allows for more spontaneous cell firing. When negative stimulation (cathodal tDCS) is delivered, the current causes a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential. This decreases neuron excitability due to the decreased spontaneous cell firing.|$|R
5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence {{can be fatal}} {{if it is not}} properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E
5|$|Swarming {{behaviour}} is {{a response}} to overcrowding. Increased tactile <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. A large swarm can consist of billions of locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, with a population of up to 80 million individuals per square kilometre (200 million per square mile). When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which causes them to become mutually attracted, a prerequisite for swarming.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Electrical {{stimulation}} can {{be applied}} {{in a variety of}} ways to the hemiparetic upper extremity following stroke. The aim of this review is to explore the relationship between characteristics <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> and the effect <b>of</b> electrical <b>stimulation</b> on the recovery of upper limb motor control following stroke. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed to identify clinical trials evaluating the effect <b>of</b> electrical <b>stimulation</b> on motor control. The reported outcomes were examined to identify a possible relationship between the reported effect and the following characteristics: duration <b>of</b> <b>stimulation,</b> method <b>of</b> <b>stimulation,</b> setting <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> parameters, target muscles and stage after stroke. Results: Nineteen clinical trials were included, and the results of 22 patient groups were evaluated. A positive effect <b>of</b> electrical <b>stimulation</b> was reported for 13 patient groups. Positive results were more common when electrical stimulation was triggered by voluntary movement rather than when non-triggered electrical stimulation was used. There was no relation between the effect <b>of</b> electrical <b>stimulation</b> and the other characteristics examined. Conclusion: Triggered electrical stimulation may be more effective than non-triggered electrical stimulation in facilitating upper extremity motor recovery following stroke. It appears that the specific stimulus parameters may not be crucial in determining the effect <b>of</b> electrical <b>stimulation.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{deep brain}} <b>stimulation</b> (DBS) <b>of</b> the subthalamic nucleus (STN) {{is a highly}} {{effective}} therapeutic intervention in severe Parkinson's disease, its mechanism of action remains unclear. One possibility is that DBS suppresses local pathologically synchronized oscillatory activity. To explore this we recorded from DBS electrodes implanted in the STN of 16 patients with Parkinson's disease during simultaneous stimulation (pulse-width 60 µs; frequency 130 Hz) of the same target using a specially designed amplifier. We analyzed data from 25 sides and found that DBS progressively suppressed peaks in local field potential activity at frequencies between 11 and 30 Hz as voltage was increased beyond a <b>stimulation</b> threshold <b>of</b> 1. 5 V. Median peak power had fallen to 54 % of baseline values by a <b>stimulation</b> intensity <b>of</b> 3. 0 V.
