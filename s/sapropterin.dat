40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} test whether tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4) supplementation {{improves}} nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity in smokers. BACKGROUNDIn smokers, endothelium-derived NO bioactivity is impaired. BH 4 is an essential cofactor of NO synthase, and its deficiency decreases NO bioactivity. METHODSSapropterin hydrochloride, an active analogue of BH 4 (2 mg/kg body weight), was administered orally to healthy male smokers and age-matched nonsmokers. Before and 3 and 24 h after <b>sapropterin,</b> we measured plasma levels of BH 4 and examined flow-mediated vasodilation (FMV) of the brachial artery by high resolution ultrasonography, a noninvasive test of endothelial function. RESULTSBasal plasma levels of BH 4 were not different between smokers and nonsmokers. <b>Sapropterin</b> administration increased plasma levels of BH 4 by threefold at 3 h, which returned to the baseline at 24 h. Before <b>sapropterin,</b> FMV was significantly smaller in smokers (p = 0. 0002). <b>Sapropterin</b> significantly augmented endothelium-dependent vasodilation in smokers, but did not affect it in nonsmokers (p = 0. 001 by analysis of variance [ANOVA]). Coadministration of NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA), an NO synthase inhibitor (20 μmol), into the brachial artery completely abolished the vasodilatory effects of <b>sapropterin</b> (p = 0. 002 by ANOVA). Endothelium-independent vasodilation by glyceryl trinitrate was not different between smokers and nonsmokers and was not altered by BH 4. CONCLUSIONSWe demonstrated that BH 4 supplementation improved bioactivity of endothelium-derived NO in smokers.

40|$|The usual {{treatment}} for phenylketonuria (PKU) is a phenylalanine-restricted diet. Following this diet is challenging, and long-term adherence (and hence metabolic control) is commonly poor. Patients with PKU (usually, but not exclusively, {{with a relatively}} mild form of the disorder) who are responsive to treatment with pharmacological doses of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) have either lower concentrations of blood phenylalanine or improved dietary phenylalanine tolerance. The availability of a registered formulation of BH(4) (<b>sapropterin</b> dihydrochloride, Kuvan (R)) has raised many practical issues and new questions in the dietary management of these patients. Initially, patients and carers must understand clearly the likely benefits (and limitations) of <b>sapropterin</b> therapy. A minority of patients who respond to <b>sapropterin</b> are able to discontinue the phenylalanine-restricted diet completely, while others are able to relax the diet to some extent.

40|$|Abstract Despite the {{appearance}} of new treatment, dietary approach remains the mainstay of PKU therapy. The nutritional management has become complex to optimize PKU patients' growth, development and diet compliance. This paper review critically new advances and challenges that have recently focused attention on potential relevant of LCPUFA supplementation, progress in protein substitutes and new protein sources, large neutral amino acids and <b>sapropterin.</b> Given the functional effects, DHA is conditionally essential substrates that should be supplied with PKU diet in infancy but even beyond. An European Commission Programme is going on to establish quantitative DHA requirements in this population. Improvements in the palatability, presentation, convenience and nutritional composition of protein substitutes have helped to improve long-term compliance with PKU diet, although it can be expected for further improvement in this area. Glycomacropeptide, a new protein source, may help to support dietary compliance of PKU subject but further {{studies are needed to}} evaluate this metabolic and nutritional issues. The PKU diet is difficult to maintain in adolescence and adult life. Treatment with large neutral amino acids or <b>sapropterin</b> in selected cases can be helpful. However, more studies are necessary to investigate the potential role, dose, and composition of large neutral amino acids in PKU treatment and to show long-term efficacy and tolerance. Ideally treatment with <b>sapropterin</b> would lead to acceptable blood Phe control without dietary treatment but this is uncommon and <b>sapropterin</b> will usually be given in combination with dietary treatment, but clinical protocol evaluating adjustment of PKU diet and <b>sapropterin</b> dosage are needed.

Untreated, this disorder will result in severe intellectual disability. However, with proper management, outcome is excellent. For many years, this disorder was managed exclusively with dietary measures which consisted of a phenylalanine-restricted diet. However, with the recent introduction of a stable, orally bioavailable form of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4), the cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase, treatment in this disorder has been drastically altered. This stable form of BH 4, <b>sapropterin</b> dihydrochloride, has a very good safety profile and is very effective in many patients with PKU in lowering plasma phenylalanine levels and allowing for liberalization of the phenylalanine-restricted diet. The introduction of BH 4 has posed many new challenges in the treatment of PKU, including developing the best protocol {{to determine whether or not}} a patient will respond to BH 4, and how to treat atypical populations including young children, fully affected, untreated adults, and pregnant patients. In this review, we will examine the history of treatment in PKU, the history of treatment with BH 4, protocol options for determining if a patient is a drug responder, and considerations for treatment in special populations.

40|$|An {{overview}} of the diagnostics and treatment of phenylketonuria in Slovakia is presented in this paper. The nature of diseases, incidence and prevalence in Slovakia, its genetic characteristics, current laboratory diagnostics and treatment options are defined. A new method of phenylketonuria screening in Slovakia, which has brought substantial improvement in early detection {{of the disease and}} shortening time for definitive diagnosis since 1995 as well as the importance of a tandem MS/MS (mass spectrometry) introduced in the diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorders, is presented. The current state of phenylketonuria treatment focusing on low-protein dietary treatment and supplementation of amino acid mixtures is analysed. The use of <b>sapropterin,</b> enzyme replacement therapy, large neutral amino acids supplementation and gene therapy are also discussed...|$|E

Enzyme deficiency causes accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) and if left untreated will lead to profound and irreversible intellectual disability in most children. Traditionally, it has been managed with a low-Phe diet supplemented with a Phe-free protein substitute although newer treatment options mainly in combination with diet are available for some subgroups of patients with PKU, for example, <b>sapropterin,</b> large neutral amino acids, and glycomacropeptide. The diet consists of three parts: 1) severe restriction of dietary Phe; 2) replacement of non-Phe L-amino acids with a protein substitute commonly supplemented with essential fatty acids and other micronutrients; and 3) low-protein foods from fruits, some vegetables, sugars, fats and oil, and special low-protein foods (SLPF). The prescription of diet is challenging for health professionals. The high-carbohydrate diet supplied by a limited range of foods may program food preferences and contribute to obesity in later life. Abnormal tasting and satiety-promoting protein substitutes are administered to coincide with peak appetite times to ensure their consumption, but this practice may impede appetite for other important foods. Intermittent dosing of micronutrients when combined with L-amino acid supplements may lead to their poor bioavailability. Much work is required on the ideal nutritional profiling for special SLPF and Phe-free L-amino acid supplements. Although non-diet treatments are being studied, {{it is important to}} continue to fully understand all the consequences of diet therapy as it is likely to remain the foundation of therapy for many years.

40|$|Thanks to newborn {{screening}} and early dietary therapy, individuals with PKU no longer experience intellectual disability (mental retardation). Nevertheless, {{many do not}} achieve their full potential. The establishment of uniform guidelines and improved management for PKU can lead to optimal outcomes in this metabolic disorder. Two new approaches are currently available {{for the treatment of}} PKU in some patients:- The use of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4; <b>sapropterin)</b> in individuals with PKU with certain mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. - Supplementation with large neutral amino acids (LNAA) other than phenylalanine. Further approaches, such as recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), which degrades phenylalanine, and gene therapy, using viral or non-viral vectors to correct murine PKU, are at the experimental stage. In this textbook past, present, and future efforts related to PKU and BH 4 deficiencies are discussed. The reviews and scientific contributions in this book provide professionals, the patients and their families to understand PKU within a biochemical, neurological and psychosocial context...|$|E
