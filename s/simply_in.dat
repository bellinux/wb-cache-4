25|$|The general {{tendency}} of administrative centralisation under the Tudor dynasty began to undermine Cornwall's distinctive status.

25|$|This was proven by Georg Cantor in his 1874 uncountability proof, {{part of his}} {{groundbreaking}} {{study of}} different infinities, and later more <b>simply</b> <b>in</b> his diagonal argument.

25|$|The first {{congregation}} (on {{the morning}} of 4 March) focused on introductory matters, picking three assistants to the Camerlengo, the recent Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization, and a suggestion of a message of appreciation to Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, with 13 cardinals giving speeches (<b>simply</b> <b>in</b> the order they had requested to speak). The second congregation (the evening of 4 March) featured the preaching {{of the first of}} two required meditations by Father Raniero Cantalamessa and nine more addresses.|$|E
25|$|Sarhili is {{believed}} {{by many people}} {{to have been the}} instigator of the prophecies. Certainly some of the principal chiefs believed that they were acting <b>simply</b> <b>in</b> preparation for a last struggle with the Europeans, their plan being to throw the whole Xhosa nation fully armed and famished upon the colony. Belief in the prophecy was bolstered by the death of Lieutenant-General Cathcart in the Crimean War in 1854. His death was interpreted as being due to intervention by the ancestors.|$|E

25|$|When {{the patient}} ingests {{just a small}} amount of food, the first {{response}} is a stretching of the wall of the stomach pouch, stimulating nerves which tell the brain that the stomach is full. The patient feels a sensation of fullness, as if they had just eaten a large meal—but with just a thimble-full of food. Most people do not stop eating <b>simply</b> <b>in</b> response to a feeling of fullness, but the patient rapidly learns that subsequent bites must be eaten very slowly and carefully, to avoid increasing discomfort or vomiting.|$|E
25|$|If Hampshire's target {{had been}} set by the Average Run Rate method (<b>simply</b> <b>in</b> {{proportion}} to the reduction in overs), their par score would have been 231 x 28/30 = 215.6, giving 216 to win or 215 to tie. While this would have kept the required run rate the same as Lancashire achieved (7.7 runs per over), this would have given an unfair advantage to Hampshire as it's easier to achieve and maintain a run rate for a shorter period. Increasing Hampshire's target from 216 overcomes this flaw.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} a habit of literate {{cultures}} to view oral cultures <b>simply</b> <b>in</b> terms of their lack of the technologies of writing. This habit, argues Ong, is dangerously misled. Oral cultures are living cultures in their own right. A 1971 study found that of 3,000 extant languages, only 78 had a written literature. While literacy extends human possibilities in both thought and action, all literate technologies ultimately depend {{on the ability of}} humans to learn oral languages and then translate sound into symbolic imagery.|$|E

25|$|It {{is widely}} {{known from the}} fossil record that the more common arbuscular mycorrhizas formed long before more derived associations, and thus {{represent}} an ancestral condition. Ectomycorrhizas, forming {{with an array of}} conifers and angiosperms, may have evolved along with the diversification of plants. Thus, it is possible that arbuscular mycorrhizas were a driving force in the plant colonization of land as an expansive new niche, while ectomycorrhizas acted to spur further speciation due to the change of earth’s climate to more seasonal and arid, or perhaps <b>simply</b> <b>in</b> response to nutritionally deficient habitats.|$|E
25|$|From a vector {{calculus}} perspective, the CG coefficients {{associated with}} the SO(3) group can be defined <b>simply</b> <b>in</b> terms of integrals of products of spherical harmonics and their complex conjugates. The addition of spins in quantum-mechanical terms can be read directly from this approach as spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of total angular momentum and projection thereof onto an axis, and the integrals correspond to the Hilbert space inner product. From the formal definition of angular momentum, recursion relations for the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients can be found. There also exist complicated explicit formulas for their direct calculation.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong rejects dispositionalism, {{the idea}} that dispositional {{properties}} (or powers as they are sometimes referred to) are ontologically significant and {{have an important role}} in explaining laws of nature. Armstrong believes that the challenge that dispositionalism presents for his account of laws of nature is not in the case of manifested dispositions (say, a glass dropping on the ground and breaking) but unmanifested dispositions (the fact that counter factually if one were to drop the glass on the ground, it would break). Armstrong simply states that the disposition is <b>simply</b> <b>in</b> the nature of the instantiated properties of the thing which is supposed to have the disposition.|$|E
