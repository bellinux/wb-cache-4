Jackson was selected to endorse fashion line Blackglama for a second year, being the first celebrity in the line's history chosen to do so. She partnered with the label to release a fifteen-piece collection of luxury products. In 2012, Jackson endorsed Nutrisystem, sponsoring their weight-loss program after struggling with weight fluctuations in the past. With the program, she donated ten million dollars in meals to the hungry. She was honored by amfAR for her contributions to AIDS research when chairing the Cinema Against AIDS gala during the Cannes Film Festival. She also participated in a public service announcement for UNICEF to help <b>starving</b> <b>children.</b> In February 2013, Jackson announced she was married to her third husband, Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana, during a private ceremony the previous year.|$|E

40|$|EN 1) Each moral {{property}} {{is identical to}} some natural property. (EN 2) Each moral term (e. g., good) refers to some natural property and has that property as its semantic content. The Open Question Argument is alleged to show that if moral realism is true, then each moral property must be identical with some non-natural property and that each moral term like “good ” does not have some natural property as its content. Consider the following question schemas: (Q 1) Helping a <b>starving</b> <b>child</b> is good, but is helping a <b>starving</b> <b>child</b> N? (Q 2) Helping a <b>starving</b> <b>child</b> is good, but is helping a <b>starving</b> <b>child</b> good? Let N range over natural properties. The assumption is that for any candidate natural property for N, the question yielded by filling in the variable in (Q 1) would always be open, whereas the question yielded by filling in the variable in (Q 2) would always be closed. What {{it is for a}} question to be open and closed is difficult to explain, and it might help if we had an example. So let’s substitute pleasant-ness for N. We get the following two questions by filling in the variables from (Q 1) and (Q 2) : (Q 1 A) Helping a <b>starving</b> <b>child</b> is good, but is helping a <b>starving</b> <b>child</b> pleasant? (Q 2 A) Helping a <b>starving</b> <b>child</b> is good, but is helping a <b>starving</b> <b>child</b> good? Q 1 A and Q 2 A differ in cognitive significance. A reasonable person might sensibly ask Q 1 A. But it seems that a person could not sensibly ask Q 2 A. Q 2 A is closed in the sense that once you have made a judgment that something is good, you already have your answer to the question “Is it good? ” Q 1 A is open in the sense that, having made a judgment about the goodness of helping the poor, you do not necessarily have an answer to that question...|$|R

25|$|Both {{during and}} after the war, Benedict was {{primarily}} concerned about the fate of the children, about which he even issued an encyclical. In 1916 he appealed to the people and clergy of the United States to help him feed the <b>starving</b> <b>children</b> in German-occupied Belgium. His aid to children was not limited to Belgium but extended to children in Lithuania, Poland, Lebanon, Montenegro, Syria and Russia. Benedict was particularly appalled at the new military invention of aerial warfare and protested several times against it to no avail.|$|E

The U.N. blamed two years of failed rainfall and the ongoing tribal clashes in the region for helping to create the humanitarian crisis in southern Sudan.

25|$|The {{international}} {{humanitarian organisation}} Médecins Sans Frontières originated {{in response to}} the suffering in Biafra. During the crisis, French medical volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the Nigerian army and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. French doctor Bernard Kouchner also witnessed these events, particularly the huge number of <b>starving</b> <b>children,</b> and, when he returned to France, he publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. With the help of other French doctors, Kouchner put Biafra in the media spotlight and called for an international response to the situation. These doctors, led by Kouchner, concluded that a new aid organisation was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims.|$|E

500|$|... "Starvin' Marvin" [...] explores and satirizes gluttony in the US, {{particularly}} {{through its}} unflattering portrayal of Sally Struthers, who gorges on donated food meant for <b>starving</b> <b>children.</b> The greed and wastefulness {{shown in the}} buffet scene, as well as Cartman's overall greediness and lack of understanding regarding the plight of starving African children, has been said to demonstrate an over-abundance and decadence typically associated with Americans. The destructive rampage of the turkeys provides a commentary on genetic engineering. Scott Calef, a philosophy professor who studies popular culture, said the destruction sown by the turkeys, despite {{the best of intentions}} by Dr. Mephisto, are indicative of the unpredictable nature and ethical ambiguity of the use of genetic engineering for the betterment of humankind.|$|E

500|$|After {{seeing a}} {{commercial}} about <b>starving</b> <b>children</b> in Africa, Cartman, Stan, Kenny and Kyle send money to Sally Struthers' charity organization, the Christian Children's Fund. They {{do not care}} about the cause, but want the free sports watch {{that comes with the}} sponsorship. However, due to a miscommunication, an Ethiopian boy is delivered to the boys instead of the watch. Although initially shocked, the four boys befriend him, and Cartman names the boy Starvin' Marvin ("Marvin" [...] being given to him by the apparent pronunciation of the name when he was talking in his native language). Meanwhile, mobs of wild turkeys begin attacking and killing South Park residents. Mad scientist Dr. Mephisto tries to warn Mayor McDaniels that genetically engineered turkeys he had been breeding to feed to the poor have gone crazy and are now attacking humans. Mephisto is instead ignored and ridiculed by McDaniels.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{partially}} {{inspired by the}} commercials for the Christian Children's Fund, in which Sally Struthers encourages viewers to donate money to provide food for <b>starving</b> <b>children</b> in Africa. Parker {{said he did not}} really believe Struthers was hoarding food from the charity, but he came up with the concept because he found it funny that such an obese woman would make a public plea for food for others. Parker said he had always wondered how a starving African child would react if they were taken to a large buffet dinner at an American restaurant, with [...] "people leaving tons of food on their plates", which served as further inspiration for the episode. Parker and Stone originally planned for Struthers to die {{at the end of the}} episode and have the African children eat her and live off her fat; Comedy Central executives told the duo they could not kill Struthers, although celebrities have been killed off in subsequent episodes without any objections from the network.|$|E
500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, Parker and Stone {{received}} feedback that audiences felt [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] was especially unkind to Struthers. Although {{they did not}} speak to her themselves, the duo received word that Struthers was {{a fan of the}} show until [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] aired, after which she was very upset and reportedly reacted emotionally over her portrayal. Struthers was particularly saddened by the fact that her character steals food from the same <b>starving</b> <b>children</b> she had been working to help. Parker and Stone were slightly remorseful when they learned of her reaction and have said they did not have anything against Struthers personally. Nevertheless, Struthers was portrayed in an even less flattering way in the third season episode [...] "Starvin' Marvin in Space" [...] as a Jabba the Hutt-like creature. In a DVD commentary track, Parker said of Struthers, [...] "Dude, you're really setting yourself up if you're going to be that fat and go on the air talking about [...] ... We don't think she's a bad person, she's probably nice to try to do this, but cut down on the Twinkies a little bit before going on the air." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{scenes in}} which Chef, {{and later the}} lead turkey, don blue and white war paint and speak {{inspirational}} words to their armies are a parody of Braveheart, the 1995 Mel Gibson-directed film about Scottish historical hero William Wallace. Parker {{said it was the}} first of many times a film was spoofed in a South Park episode, even though both said they enjoyed Braveheart. [...] During class, Mr. Garrison incorrectly tells the children the internationally known English pop singer Engelbert Humperdinck was the first man to walk on the moon. Also in the classroom, when it is suggested some poor people would rather die than go to a poorhouse, Cartman says, [...] "Well then perhaps they should – and decrease the surplus population!" [...] The line is lifted word-for-word from the Charles Dickens novella A Christmas Carol, prompting Mr. Garrison to respond, [...] "Okay, kids, that's enough Dickens for one day." [...] Kyle incorrectly tells Stan that Sally Struthers appeared on Full House, an American sitcom that ran from the late 1980s to early 1990s; she actually starred in the 1970s series All in the Family. When Dr. Mephisto asks Chef to look into his microscope, Chef says he sees [...] "an extreme close-up of Vanessa Redgrave's private parts", a reference to the Academy Award-winning English actress. At the end of the episode, Stan said it is important to remember the images of <b>starving</b> <b>children</b> on television are [...] "just as real as you or I". Kyle says by that logic, MacGyver is a real person too, a reference to the secret agent protagonist from the 1980s television series of the same name.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2012, a spoof charity {{music video}} was {{produced}} by a South African rapper named Breezy V.
