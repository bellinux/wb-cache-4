The vessels are connected by a so-called <b>superleak.</b> This is a tube, filled with a very fine powder, so the flow of the normal component is blocked. However, the superfluid component can flow through this <b>superleak</b> without any problem (below a critical velocity of about 20 cm/s). In the steady state vs=0 so Eq. implieswhere the index l (r) applies to the left (right) side of the <b>superleak.</b> In this particular case pl = 0, zl = zr, and pfl = 0 (since Tl = 0). Consequently,This means that the pressure in the right vessel is equal to the fountain pressure at Tr.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} studies of quantum {{turbulence}} with second-sound in superfluid 4 He {{in which the}} turbulence is generated by {{the flow of the}} superfluid component through a wide square channel, the ends of which are plugged with sintered silver <b>superleaks,</b> the flow being generated by compression of a bellows. The <b>superleaks</b> ensure that there is no net flow of the normal fluid. In an earlier paper (Phys. Rev. B, 86, 134515 (2012)) we have shown that steady flow of this kind generates a density of vortex lines that is essentially identical with that generated by thermal counterflow, when the average relative velocity between the two fluids is the same. In this paper we report on studies of the temporal decay of the vortex-line density, observed when the bellows is stopped, and we compare the results with those obtained from the temporal decay of thermal counterflow re-measured in the same channel and under the same conditions. In both cases here is an initial fast decay which, for low enough initial line density approaches for a short time the form $t^{- 1 }$ characteristic of the decay of a random vortex tangle. This is followed at late times by a slower $t^{- 3 / 2 }$ decay, characteristic of the decay of large 'quasi-classical eddies'. However, in the range of investigated parameters, we observe always in the case of thermal counterflow, and only in a few cases of high steady-state velocity in superflow, an intermediate regime in which the decay either does not proceed monotonically with time or passes through a point of inflexion. This difference, established firmly by our experiments, might represent one essential ingredient for the full theoretical understanding of counterflow turbulence...|$|R

40|$|A flow source {{has been}} {{developed}} to generate turbulent superfluid flows in channels equipped for detection of quantised vortices. The source consists of a motor driven low temperature compressible volume capable of pushing or sucking superfluid 4 He into a flow channel.

In this paper we present the technical details of the apparatus, along with some raw data obtained during the first successful low temperature test. The test has been performed using the source to generate a flow into a channel whose ends have been blocked by <b>superleaks</b> to allow for the inflow and outflow of the superfluid component of helium only. This technique enables to determine the areal density of quantised vortex lines in the temperature range 1. 3 to 2. 1 K, with well controlled flow velocities between 0. 01 and 30 cm/s...|$|R

In this note we describe a simple refinement of the technique, by which samples of very much higher purity may be prepared and in which the quality of the <b>superleak</b> is relatively unimportant.

We have confirmed {{the existence of a}} weakly temperature dependent critical velocity (2) vIcr of order 1 cm/s, which does not scale with the channel size and is therefore an intrinsic property of the self-sustained vortex tangle of vortex line density L, measured by second sound attenuation. Our principal result was that in addition to the previously reported turbulent A-state (3) characterized by L 1 / 2 = γ(T) (vs − vIcr), where vs is the mean superflow velocity through the channel, we have discovered a new B-state characterized by L = β(vs − v II cr), where β seems only weakly temperature dependent. We have offered a phenomenological model assuming that in the B-state the coarse-grained superflow profile matches the classical parabolic profile, with a finite, temperature dependent slip velocity vIIcr of order few cm/s and that a confined viscous normal fluid flow of toroidal form is induced inside the channel due to the mutual friction force.

40|$|We {{consider}} a uniform superfluid confined in two compartments {{connected by a}} <b>superleak</b> and initially held at equal temperatures. If {{one of the two}} compartments is heated, a fraction of the superfluid will flow through the <b>superleak.</b> We show that, under certain thermodynamic conditions, the atoms flow from the hotter to the colder compartment, contrary to what happens in the fountain effect observed in superfluid Helium. This flow causes quantum degeneracy to increase in the colder compartment. In superfluid Helium, this novel thermomechanical effect takes place in the phonon regime of very low temperatures. In dilute quantum gases, it occurs at all temperatures below Tc. The increase in quantum degeneracy reachable through the adiabatic displacement of the wall separating the two compartments is also discussed...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} the {{investigation}} of a one-shot cooling technique, called adiabatic expansion of 3 He in superfluid 4 He, are reported. The expansion cooler basically consists of an expansion cell and a 4 He reservoir connected by a <b>superleak.</b> In the expansion cell nearly pure 3 He is gradually diluted to a saturated mixture by the injection of superfluid 4 He from the 4 He reservoir. The expansion of the 3 He produces cooling, which, in the ideal (isentropic) case can lower the temperature by a factor 4. 56. In practice, the performance of this cooling method is limited by irreversibilities and heat leaks. In this paper several irreversible processes such as heat conduction, viscous effects, and supercritical 4 He flow, have been analyzed. Furthermore the effect of 3 He in a sinter layer in the expansion cell is discussed. The experiments have shown that the fountain pressure in the 4 He reservoir is very suitable for driving the 4 He {{in and out of the}} expansion cell. During an expansion/extraction the 4 He chemical potential difference across the <b>superleak</b> is zero. The realised cooling factor, defined as the ratio of the initial temperature and the final temperature, is about 3. 5 for initial temperatures between 20 mK to 190 mK. This value is lower than the ideal factor of 4. 56 that can be obtained for isentropic expansions. The discrepancy is mainly due to the relatively large heat leak. The lowest temperature obtained in this investigation was 5. 7 mK. The analyses have revealed no fundamental limitations for obtaining lower temperatures...|$|E

Previous publications observed the detection of an OST signal that was faster than the second sound velocity. This fast propagation could be verified in dedicated small scale experiments. Resistors were used to simulate the quench spots under controlled conditions. The three dimensional propagation of second sound was linked to OST signals for the first time, which improves the understanding of the OST signal and allows to gather information about the heating pulse.

This refrigerator {{has the potential}} to provide efficient, continuous cooling to temperatures below 50 mK for detectors, and has the benefits over existing magnetic coolers of reduced mass because of faster cycle times, the ability to pump the cooled fluid to remote cooling locations away from the magnetic field created by the superconducting magnet, elimination of the added complexity and mass of heat switches, and elimination of the need for a thermal bus and single crystal paramagnetic materials due to the good thermal contact between the fluid and the paramagnetic material.

40|$|Effects {{of crystal}} growth {{on the fourth}} sound {{propagation}} are studied {{in the framework of}} hydrodynamics. The particular system we have in mind is superfluid 4 He in a grafoil <b>superleak.</b> Solid 4 He is formed on the surface of graphite and it grows continuously when the pressure of liquid is increased during passage of a sound wave. Sound velocity and Doppler shifts for steady superfluid flow are calculated {{as a function of the}} strength of the substrate potential (or equivalently the thickness of the solid layer) and the rate of crystal growth. In the limit of strong substrate potential (thin solid layer) or slow crystal growth they are the same as the usual fourth sound. On the other hand, if the potential is weak and the crystal growth is fast, we find several new features : the sound velocity approaches zero at T = 0 because the fast crystal growth does not allow pressure changes of the liquid, but at finite temperatures the change of entropy density on crystallization (or melting) assures propagation of the sound The Doppler shift is much larger than the velocity of the flow and is in the opposite sense.

40|$|A new {{technique}} of superconducting cavity diagnostics {{has been introduced}} by D. [*]L. Hartill at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. It uses oscillating <b>superleak</b> transducers (OST) which detect the heat transferred from a cavity’s quench point via Second Sound through the superfluid He bath, needed to cool the superconducting cavity. The localization of the quench point is done by triangulation. The observed response of an OST is a nontrivial, but reproducible pattern of oscillations. A small helium evaporation cryostat was built which allows {{the investigation of the}} response of an OST in greater detail. The distance between a pointlike electrical heater and the OST can be varied. The OST can be mounted either parallel or perpendicular to the plate that houses the heat source. If the artificial quench point releases an amount of energy compatible to a real quench spot on a cavity’s surface, the OST signal starts with a negative pulse, which is usually strong enough to allow automatic detection. Furthermore, the reflection of the Second Sound on the wall is observed. A reflection coefficient R= 0. 39 ± 0. 05 of the glass wall is measured. This excludes a strong influence of multiple reflections in the complex OST response. Fourier analyses show three main frequencies, found in all OST spectra.

This is m contrast to a recent prediction. A recent calculation predicted [1] that the adiabatic rotation of superfluid 4 He in a <b>superleak</b> might produce a substantial cooling effect. The calculation is based on the experimental observation [2] that the superfluid density Ps depends on V R, the relative velocity of the normal and superfluid components. Using the experimental result [3] 8 ps/Ps ~ 1. 5 % when V R ~- 40 cm sec-I the predicted temperature change from an initial temperature of I°K is ATe,- 0. 25 °K. We have performed a different calculation based on a theoretical expression [3] for S(T, VR) which predicts a much smaller AT. In this letter we discuss both calculations and an experiment which shows that AT< 4 X 10 -S°K. Both calculations are {{based on the fact that}} in a quasistatic adiabatic process the entropy is a constant. For such a reversible process ref. [1] treats the entropy S as a function of T and Ps and arrives at the following estimate of the temperature change: AT S~, iSpsl where S x is the entropy at larnbda point, and C v is the specific heat. Using the experimental value [3] of 5 ps/p s one gets AT~- 0. 25 °K at T ~I°K. This estimate is not valid because eq.
