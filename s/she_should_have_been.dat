5|$|Throughout {{the evening}} on October 23, {{a series of}} phone calls between Green and Farrar {{escalated}} into a confrontation. Farrar was convinced that Green was continuing to drink heavily while <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> caring for the children, and he told Green that he knew she had poisoned him and that Social Services might be called to protect the children if she failed to get her life in order. After the last call between Green and Farrar, Farrar watched television alone in his apartment until about 12:30, when a neighbor's phone call alerted him to the fire.|$|E
5|$|Walton's last {{work of the}} 1940s was {{his music}} for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On {{the advice of the}} BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's {{relations}} with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} judge certifies {{his or her}} decision, {{which is}} final, to the Prime Minister. The judge must also report to the Prime Minister whether any corrupt or illegal practice was established to have been committed by or with the knowledge and consent of any candidate or his or her agent. If a judge intends to report {{a person who was}} neither a party to the proceedings nor a candidate claiming he or <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> declared elected, that person must be given an opportunity to be heard and to give and call evidence to show why a report should not be made against him. However, where a candidate's agents are found to have been guilty of treating, undue influence or an illegal practice, but the candidate proves that the offences were committed contrary to his or her orders and without his or her sanction or connivance, or that of his or her election agents, that all reasonable means were taken to prevent corrupt and illegal practices at the election, that the offences were of a trivial and limited nature, and in other respects the election was free from corrupt or illegal practice, the election is not void.|$|E

I cannot decide whether <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a man or a mother.

She had a head for logic, and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rarer indeed in a woman... impairing this gift was her stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes, or her own sense of right, was concerned.|$|E
25|$|In 1917 Lethbridge {{took a job}} as a {{nurse at}} Bradford Hospital where she tended troops who had been injured and maimed in the War.

She volunteered for the dangerous work of filling shells with Amatol explosive. On 23 October she was working on a recently condemned machine that packed the Amatol into the shells. It exploded killing several workers and seriously injuring Lethbridge whose left leg was blown off. Although temporarily blinded she managed to apply a tourniquet to her thigh, an act that certainly saved her life.|$|E

Fry also found the author's method of talking about her own musical aspects to be distracting, when <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> analyzing the work of Madonna.|$|E

500|$|On February 21, 2007, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that ABC was pursuing a spin-off medical drama television series for Grey's Anatomy featuring Walsh's character, Montgomery. Subsequent reports confirmed the decision, stating that an expanded two-hour broadcast of Grey's Anatomy {{would serve as}} a backdoor pilot for the proposed spin-off. The cast of Grey's Anatomy was reportedly unhappy about the decision, as all hoped the spin-off would have been given to them. Pompeo commented that she felt, as the star, <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> consulted, and Heigl disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Stevens. The backdoor pilot that aired on May 3, 2007 sees Montgomery take a leave of absence from Seattle Grace Hospital, to visit her best friend from Los Angeles, Naomi Bennett (Merrin Dungey, later Audra McDonald), a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist. While in Los Angeles, she meets Bennett's colleagues at the Oceanside Wellness Center. The two-hour broadcast entitled [...] "The Other Side of This Life" [...] served as the twenty-second and twenty-third episodes of the third season, and was directed by Michael Grossman, according to Variety. The cast included Amy Brenneman, Paul Adelstein, Tim Daly, Taye Diggs, Chris Lowell, and Merrin Dungey.|$|E
500|$|In 1931, aged 19, Ferrier {{passed her}} Licentiate {{examinations}} at the Royal Academy of Music. In that year she started occasional singing lessons, and in December sang a small mezzo-soprano {{role in a}} church performance of Mendelssohn's oratorio Elijah. However, her voice was not thought to be exceptional; her musical life centred on the piano and on local concerts, at King George's Hall and elsewhere. Early in 1934 she transferred to the Blackpool telephone exchange and took lodgings nearby, {{to be close to}} her new boyfriend, a bank clerk named Albert Wilson. While at Blackpool she auditioned for the new [...] "speaking clock" [...] service which the GPO was preparing to introduce. In her excitement, Ferrier inserted an extra aspirate into her audition, and was not chosen for the final selection in London. Her decision in 1935 to marry Wilson meant the end of her employment with the telephone exchange, since at that time the GPO did not employ married women. Of Ferrier's career to this point, the music biographer Humphrey Burton wrote: [...] "For more than a decade, when <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> studying music with the best teachers, learning English literature and foreign languages, acquiring stage craft and movement skills, and travelling to London regularly to see opera, Miss Ferrier was actually answering the telephone, getting married to a bank manager and winning tinpot competitions for her piano-playing." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 21, 2007, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that ABC was pursuing a spin-off medical drama television {{series for the}} series featuring Kate Walsh's character, Addison Montgomery. Subsequent reports confirmed the decision, stating that an expanded two-hour broadcast of Grey's Anatomy {{would serve as a}} backdoor pilot for the proposed spin-off. The cast was reportedly unhappy about the decision, as all hoped the spin-off would have been given to them. Pompeo commented that she felt, as the star, <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> consulted, and Heigl, disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Izzie.

While in Los Angeles, she meets Bennett's colleagues at the Oceanside Wellness Center and even becomes the clinic's obstetrician-gynecologist for the day. The two-hour broadcast served as the twenty-second and the twenty-third episodes of the third season, and was directed by Michael Grossman, according to Variety. The cast included Amy Brenneman, Paul Adelstein, Tim Daly, Taye Diggs, Chris Lowell and Merrin Dungey. ABC officially picked up Private Practice for its 2007 lineup on May 11, 2007. KaDee Strickland's character, Charlotte King, who would be introduced in the spin-off's first-season premiere, did not appear in the backdoor pilot. Her addition to the main cast was announced on July 11, 2007, prior to the commencement of the first season. She did not have to audition for the role, but was cast after a meeting with Rhimes. Also not present in the backdoor pilot was Audra McDonald, due to her character, Bennett, being portrayed by a different actress, Merrin Dungey. However, on June 29, 2007, ABC announced that Dungey would be replaced, with no reason given for the change. The premiere episode followed {{the second part of the}} season debut of Dancing with the Stars, and provided a lead-in to fellow freshman series, Dirty Sexy Money. Pushing Daisies, a third new series for the evening, rounded out the lineup as a lead-in to Private Practice. The series aired a total of six seasons.|$|E

2500|$|Hoyle {{was also}} at the centre of two {{unrelated}} controversies involving the politics for selecting {{the winner of the}} Nobel Prize for Physics.
