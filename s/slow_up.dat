5|$|In autumn, Granpa and Emily went fishing, and {{imagined}} of catching a whale that haled {{them through the}} Thames and through London. At bedtime, Granpa tells Emily the story of The Three Knights, of which was imagined on a bed covers. Though as he reads, he begins to <b>slow</b> <b>up</b> as he begins to drop off. So he end it with his own version, just as Emily was finally going to sleep.|$|E
25|$|The 2003 tornado season {{had been}} {{relatively}} <b>slow</b> <b>up</b> until May 1. In fact, around May 1 through July 1 {{was the most}} active {{time of the year}} in tornadoes. The first tornado report of the year came on February 15. About 400 tornadoes were reported during the first 10 days of May, more than 500 were reported during the entire month.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{structure}} of Chaplin's films, the scholar Gerald Mast sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting, rather than having a tightly unified storyline. Visually, his films are simple and economic, with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage. His approach to filming was described by the art director Eugène Lourié: [...] "Chaplin did not think in 'artistic' images when he was shooting. He believed that action is the main thing. The camera is there to photograph the actors". In his autobiography, Chaplin wrote, [...] "Simplicity is best... pompous effects <b>slow</b> <b>up</b> action, are boring and unpleasant... The camera should not intrude." [...] This approach has prompted criticism, since the 1940s, for being [...] "old fashioned", while the film scholar Donald McCaffrey sees it as an indication that Chaplin never completely understood film as a medium. Kamin, however, comments that Chaplin's comedic talent {{would not be enough}} to remain funny on screen if he did not have an [...] "ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium".|$|E

60|$|The {{captain of}} the tug heard him and saw him waving his hand, and, <b>slowing</b> <b>up,</b> made a half circle toward shore.|$|R
60|$|Evidently Jack Darrow {{was getting}} winded, for when {{a quarter of}} a mile had been passed he <b>slowed</b> <b>up</b> and turned around.|$|R
500|$|One {{scene that}} {{was cut from}} the film {{occurred}} during Ripley's final escape from the Nostromo: she encounters Dallas and Brett who have been partially cocooned by the Alien. O'Bannon had intended the scene to indicate that Brett was becoming an alien egg while Dallas was held nearby to be implanted by the resulting facehugger. Production Designer Michael Seymour later suggested that Dallas had [...] "become sort of food for the alien creature", while Ivor Powell suggested that [...] "Dallas {{is found in the}} ship as an egg, still alive." [...] Scott remarked that [...] "they're morphing, metamorphosing, they are changing into...being consumed, I guess, by whatever the Alien's organism is...into an egg." [...] The scene was cut partly because it did not look realistic enough, but also because it slowed the pace of the escape sequence. Tom Skerritt remarked that [...] "The picture had to have that pace. Her trying {{to get the hell out}} of there, we're all rooting for her to get out of there, and for her to <b>slow</b> <b>up</b> and have a conversation with Dallas was not appropriate." [...] The footage was included with other deleted scenes as a special feature on the Laserdisc release of Alien, and a shortened version of it was re-inserted into the 2003 Director's Cut which was re-released in theaters and on DVD.|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{the morning}} express. It wasn't {{much of a}} job to persuade the {{conductor}} to <b>slow</b> <b>up</b> about here when he knew what our business was." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently {{a village}} having many queer spires and minarets whisked by {{him like a}} flash. Rob became worried, and {{resolved}} to <b>slow</b> <b>up</b> at the next sign of habitation.|$|E
6000|$|At {{first they}} went {{so fast that}} they could {{scarcely}} catch their breaths, but presently Quox <b>slowed</b> <b>up</b> and said {{with a sort of}} cackling laugh: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{knew that}} Henry {{would be much}} {{disappointed}} {{if he was not}} in at the death. They <b>slowed</b> <b>up</b> and soon the young hunter came in sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we've {{not seen}} {{anything}} of him yet," [...] remarked the senator's son, as they <b>slowed</b> <b>up</b> and looked ahead and {{to both sides}} of the village street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I {{want you}} all to stand in a group, with your fish on strings," [...] said Laura, a little later, when the fishing seemed to <b>slow</b> <b>up</b> a little. And then she {{arranged}} them to suit herself and took two snapshots.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the four Rovers had left the boardwalk and were plowing along {{on the side of}} the road through mud that varied from an inch to six inches in depth. They had started to run, but were soon {{compelled}} to <b>slow</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Say!" [...] exclaimed Jack, suddenly, {{and held}} up his hand, [...] "this won't do at all. The folks downstairs will think we're pulling the house down over their ears. We'll have to <b>slow</b> <b>up</b> a bit. You know what our fathers said a little while ago." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{she was a}} teenager, Brigid {{was trying}} to go see Saint Patrick but was <b>slowed</b> <b>up</b> by the crowd. To get through, she healed people along the way.|$|R
60|$|Presently Sounder <b>slowed</b> <b>up</b> and {{appeared}} at fault. We found him puzzling over an open, grassy patch, and after nosing {{it for a}} little while, he began skirting the edge.|$|R
60|$|Scarcely had {{the door}} of the car closed behind us than we were <b>slowing</b> <b>up</b> to stop at the landing above, so rapid was our ascent of the long shaft.|$|R
60|$|The men talked but little. Dale led the way, with Tom {{trotting}} noiselessly {{beside his}} horse. John followed close behind. They loped the horses across parks, trotted through the forests, walked <b>slow</b> <b>up</b> what few inclines they met, and {{slid down the}} soft, wet, pine-matted descents. So they averaged from six to eight miles an hour. The horses held up well under that steady travel, and this without any rest at noon.|$|E
60|$|The {{other workers}} also ran forward {{to meet the}} messenger, who quickly unburdened himself of his information, and as quickly turned and scampered back toward the village. When running these beast-men often go upon all fours. Thus they leap over {{obstacles}} that would <b>slow</b> <b>up</b> a human being, and upon the level attain a speed {{that would make a}} thoroughbred look to his laurels. The result in this instance was that before I had more than assimilated the gist of the word which had been brought to the fields, I was alone, watching my co-workers speeding villageward.|$|E
60|$|The train gave a pant, then a snort, then an {{impatient}} whistle. Then {{the bell rang}} a second time, the whistle sounded a single note, and the carriages moved slowly away. A moment more, and they were sweeping out of the station; a moment more and they were rushing over the moor; another moment, and they were dashing through space, setting all terrestrial things at naught, until a station came in view; then the whistle uttered a prolonged shriek, and the train began to <b>slow.</b> <b>Up</b> to this point the policeman and his friends had sat together in comparative silence.|$|E
60|$|He {{gripped her}} hands. They were <b>slowing</b> <b>up</b> now, {{caught in a}} maze of heavy traffic {{a few blocks from}} the theatre. His voice was firm. He had regained his self-control.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nary me. An' Bill didn't know him, either," [...] replied Joe. [...] "I {{seen him}} 'way back. He was ridin' some. An' he <b>slowed</b> <b>up</b> goin' past us. Now he's runnin' again." ...|$|R
60|$|They had floated {{several miles}} down the stream and were enjoying the ride when {{suddenly}} the raft <b>slowed</b> <b>up,</b> stopped short, {{and then began to}} float back the way it had come.|$|R
60|$|Then {{of course}} she dropped that subject. She had been greatly startled on that day on hearing her cousin called Sir John by Mr <b>Slow.</b> <b>Up</b> to that moment it had never {{occurred}} to her that the man of whom she was so constantly thinking as her possible husband was a baronet. To have been Mrs Ball seemed to her to have been possible; but that she should become Lady Ball was hardly possible. She wished that he had not been called Sir John. It seemed to her to be almost natural that people should be convinced of the impropriety of such a one as her becoming the wife of a baronet.|$|E
6000|$|Mistress Cicely {{laughed a}} little triumphantly. It was {{something}} like being a Queen's daughter {{to have been the}} cause of making my Lord himself bestir himself against his will. She had her own way, and might well be good-humoured. [...] "Come, dear sir father," [...] she said, coming up to him in a coaxing, patronising way, which once would have been quite alien to them both, [...] "be not angered. You know nobody means treason! And, after all, 'tis not I but you that are the cause of all the turmoil. If you would but have ridden soberly out with your poor little Cis, {{there would have been no}} coil, but my Lord might have paced stately and <b>slow</b> <b>up</b> and down the terrace-walk undisturbed." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{burden of}} worry and dread {{that had been}} Casey's was now no more--vanished as if by magic. His job {{had not yet been}} completed, but he had won. He never glanced back at the Sioux. They had failed in their first effort at ambushing the cut, and Casey knew the troops would prevent a second attempt. Casey faced ahead. The whistle of wind filled his ears, the dry, sweet odor of the desert filled his nostrils. His car was on a {{straight}} track, rolling along down-grade, half a mile a minute. And Casey, believing he might do well to <b>slow</b> <b>up</b> gradually, lightly put on the brake. But it did not hold. He tried again. The brake had broken.|$|E
60|$|Sam did not answer, but <b>slowed</b> <b>up</b> the automobile, {{to better}} watch {{the flight of}} the biplane. Tom was making a graceful curve, {{so that he might}} pass {{directly}} over the machine below.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good--very good indeed!" [...] {{cried the}} Wizard, {{when the boat}} <b>slowed</b> <b>up</b> at the shore {{opposite}} from that whence they had departed. [...] "Even Coo-ee-oh, with all her witchcraft, could do no better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The wind is with us," [...] {{returned}} Dave. Nevertheless, he <b>slowed</b> <b>up</b> as desired, {{and then}} the pair moved forward with extreme caution, each having seen to it that his firearm was ready for immediate use.|$|R
6000|$|... "To begin with, I want a drink," [...] said Elliot, {{who called}} a waiter and then resumed: [...] "It {{was dark and}} hazy, and we were {{creeping}} up to the anchorage at Kingstown with all sail set. I was at the tiller, but the wind was very light and she would hardly steer; the tide was carrying her along. Jevons, looking out under the boom, said he saw a steamer's lights, but just then I heard a North-Wall boat in the fog. You know the noise they make when they're steaming fast, and the fog's pretty bad when those boats <b>slow</b> <b>up.</b> I knew she wasn't far off when I saw her lights; red, white, and green all together. That meant {{we had to do}} something quick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember, {{this is a}} real mule," [...] Collins {{told the}} man with the waxed moustaches. [...] "If any outsiders butt in for a hack at the money, all the better. They'll get theirs quick. The man don't live who can stay on his back a minute [...] . if you keep him rehearsed with the spike. He must live in fear of the spike. Never let him <b>slow</b> <b>up</b> on it. Never let him forget it. If you lay off any time for a few days, rehearse him with the spike a couple of times just before you begin again, or else he might forget it and queer the turn by ambling around with the first outside rube that mounts him.|$|E
6000|$|On {{both sides}} of the canyon the {{mountains}} rise wall-like, three thousand feet, and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the sun only once a day, when he sails over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long; the cabins stand well apart from each other. The tavern is the only [...] "frame" [...] house--the only house, one might say. It occupies a central position, and is the evening resort of the population. They drink there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also billiards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn places repaired with court-plaster; there are some cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which clatter when they run, and do not <b>slow</b> <b>up</b> gradually, but stop suddenly and sit down; there is part of a cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; and the man who can score six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar's expense.|$|E
60|$|On {{their return}} journey they overtook Mr. Sinclair {{at about a}} mile from the Crossing. They had never seen the man before, but when he {{signaled}} them. Uncle Eben <b>slowed</b> <b>up</b> the machine and stopped beside him.|$|R
60|$|At {{the foot}} of the hill there was a turn, and Dave <b>slowed</b> <b>up</b> to make this, and Roger did likewise. Then, as they passed a deep and muddy ditch, Dave gave a cry and came to a stop.|$|R
60|$|They {{were still}} {{two miles from}} Ashton {{when they came to}} a turn in the road. Here {{there were a number of}} trees, and it was much darker than it had been. Dick <b>slowed</b> <b>up</b> a trifle and peered ahead.|$|R
