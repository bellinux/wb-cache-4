Although benign, it can mimic the presentation of more serious underlying conditions such as Kaposi's sarcoma. We present a case of acroangiodermatitis in the stump of an amputee related to <b>suction</b> <b>socket</b> use {{in order to raise}} awareness of an unusual setting for this vascular proliferation.

40|$|Background: The suction sockets {{that are}} {{commonly}} prescribed for transtibial amputees {{are believed to}} provide a better suspension than the pin/lock systems. Nevertheless, their effect on amputees ’ gait performance {{has not yet been}} fully investigated. The main intention {{of this study was to}} understand the potential effects of the Seal-in (suction) and the Dermo (pin/lock) suspension systems on amputees ’ gait performance. Methodology/Principal Findings: Ten unilateral transtibial amputees participated in this prospective study, and two prostheses were fabricated for each of them. A three-dimensional motion analysis system was used to evaluate the temporal-spatial, kinematics and kinetics variables during normal walking. We also asked the participants to complete some part of Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) regarding their satisfaction and problems with both systems. The results revealed that there was more symmetry in temporal-spatial parameters between the prosthetic and sound limbs using the suction system. However, the difference between two systems was not significant (p, 0. 05). Evaluation of kinetic data and the subjects ’ feedback showed that the participants had more confidence using the <b>suction</b> <b>socket</b> and the sockets were more fit for walking. Nevertheless, the participants had more complaints with this system due to the difficulty in donning and doffing. Conclusion: It can be concluded that even though the <b>suction</b> <b>socket</b> could create better suspension, fit, and gait performance, overall satisfaction was higher with the pin/lock system due to easy donning and doffing of the prosthesis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Suction</b> <b>sockets</b> for transfemoral {{prostheses}} {{have been}} in existence for many years but, individuals with upper extremity amputations have only recently been re-introduced to such advancements in prosthetic fittings. The gentleman in this case study has been wearing a transhumeral cable driven prosthesis for many years with some past experience using myoeleetric systems, both transradial and transhumeral. He presented, after researching component options quite well, asking fora myoelectric transhumeral prosthesis with electric elbow, wrist rotator, hand and hook terminal device. Most of the components had already been chosen, however, he requested {{the design of the}} prosthesis be such that he would not require a harness for suspension. This is where the challenge began. A variety of socket designs were attempted using conventional means of donning <b>suction</b> <b>sockets.</b> After several fittings and discarded designs, the Flex-Seal became the solution to a difficult request...|$|R
40|$|Prostheses are {{prescribed}} {{to restore the}} mobility of people with amputated lower limbs. Monitoring the prosthesis wearing times and physical activity of prosthesis users would provide invaluable information regarding rehabilitation progress and suitability of the prosthesis. The validation of a method to determine wearing times and physical activity state, as well as strides taken, of amputees wearing <b>suction</b> suspension <b>sockets</b> is reported. Eight participants with transtibial amputation were fitted with custom-made <b>suction</b> <b>sockets.</b> Analysis algorithms were used to automatically characterize physical activity based on the pressure at the socket’s relief valve. The algorithms were validated in a laboratory-based protocol that included walking, stair climbing, standing, sitting, donning, and doffing. Intraclass correlation coefficient (2, 1) values of > 0. 98 were achieved with mean differences of – 2. 0 %, 0. 3 %, 1. 3 %, and 0. 7 % for agreement between "off," "static," and "dynamic" times and stride count, respectively, {{as determined by the}} analysis algorithms and a concurrent video analysis. This study demonstrates that an interpretation of the pressure at the pressure-relief valve of <b>suction</b> suspension <b>sockets</b> can be used to determine wearing times and activity state...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} attempts to integrate electrodes into liners to operate externally powered devices. Various methods and techniques have been tried from RTV laminated sockets to off-the-shelf liners {{as well as a}} number of thermoplastic techniques. All of these techniques, while providing improved suspension and comfort have limitations and drawbacks. However these limitations have not deterred prosthetists from pursuing these options in an effort to provide better control, better suspension and ultimately a better outcome. Through the experience of Otto Bock’s Custom Silicone Services, we will present a number of solutions. These include challenging fittings such as the transmetacarpal as well as more standard levels. <b>Suction</b> <b>Sockets</b> have been utilized in upper extremity fittings for many years now, but it has always been challenging to maintain suction in myoelectric fittings due to the difficulty of sealing around electrodes. A new solution developed by Otto Bock will also be presented...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{silicone}} {{or similar}} material with distal attachment as a suspension system has gained great acceptance and usage for lower limb amputees. Since its introduction {{in the mid}} 1980 ’s by Kristinsson, the silicone <b>suction</b> <b>socket</b> (3 S) has undergone extensive development and the options available have proliferated due to its popularity. Benefits for the lower limb include: reduced shear forces on the skin, better pressure distribution especially when a gel type liner is employed, and excellent suspension. Shortly after its introduction, 3 S technology was applied to upper limb fittings. [2] Some early success was achieved and results were promising. Problems existed related to inappropriate sizing of liners and locking system for utilization in upper limb applications and difficulty interfacing myoelectric control in combination with 3 S suspension...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Interface {{pressures}} {{were measured}} during ambula-tion {{with a normal}} total-surface weight-bearing <b>suction</b> <b>socket</b> and a vacuum-assisted socket. The vacuum-assisted socket {{has been shown to}} eliminate daily volume loss. Urethane liners were instrumented with five force-sensing resistors to measure positive pressures and one air pressure sensor at the distal end of the liner to document negative pressures. Nine unilateral tran-stibial amputees participated in the study. The vacuum-assisted socket created significantly lower positive-pressure impulse (42. 8, 39. 6 kPa•s) and peak pressures (83. 5, 80. 0 kPa) during the stance phase. The pressure impulse (– 10. 5, – 13. 3 kPa•s), average (– 21. 2, – 26. 5 kPa), and peak (– 28. 5, – 36. 3 kPa) nega-tive pressures during swing phase were significantly greater in magnitude with the vacuum-assisted socket. We believe that lower positive pressures seen during stance using the vacuum-assisted socket reduces the fluid forced out and greater negative pressures seen during swing increases the amount of fluid drawn into the limb, thereby preventing volume loss...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{studies with}} the PTB-suction {{prosthesis}} and the ordinary PTB prosthesis have provided opportunities {{to analyze and}} under-stand some functional differences in the suspension of below-knee prostheses. In a roentgenological study of the stump-socket contact significantly less vertical displacement in the PTB-suction prosthesis has been shown. A study of the pressure variations in the <b>suction</b> <b>socket</b> verified the _theory of the necessary pressure gradient in the PTB-suction socket. Added negative pressure by muscle action was also observed. An electromyographic study suggested a muscular activity pattern in the suction prosthesis {{similar to that of}} a normal leg, as a contrast to the ordinary PTB prosthesis where simultaneous contractions of antagonistic muscles seemed to be the usual pattern. The latter is interpreted as a defence reaction. An optimal prosthesis has been deduced. It shall have a soft prosthetic socket with a perfect fit, a suction, adhesion and friction fixation and a pressure gradient between the skin and the socket wall with minimum compression distally. The plaster casting shall be done in a downward modelling manner making available space for soft tissue without compression...|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} two decades, {{individuals}} with lower limb amputations have been successfully fitted with gel liners constructed {{from a variety of}} materials. Prosthetists have also reported moderate success with gel liners fit to individuals with upper limb amputations who use externally powered prostheses. At the Center for Bionic Medicine, we have explored a novel approach to collecting myoelectric signals from individuals with lower limb or upper limb amputations—using electrodes embedded in gel liners. Initial designs have proven more comfortable and easier to don than traditional <b>suction</b> <b>sockets</b> and have allowed us to eliminate the need for separate connection of pre-amplifiers. We believe this technology will be of benefit to individuals with upper or lower limb amputations and eliminate some of the clinical challenges and reported drawbacks of current myoelectric fittings. The next step is to combine the new liner technology with advanced electronics to control actuated drive units in both upper limb and lower limb prostheses. In this contribution we describe the evolution of this liner technology from initial experiences through current status to future directions...|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{artificial}} limbs {{are attached}} to the stump of the amputee by belts and cuffs or by suction. The stump either directly fits into a socket on the prosthetic, or—more commonly today—a liner is used that then is fixed to the socket either by vacuum (<b>suction</b> <b>sockets)</b> or a pin lock. Liners are soft and by that, they can create a far better suction fit than hard sockets. Silicone liners can be obtained in standard sizes, mostly with a circular (round) cross section, but for any other stump shape, custom liners can be made. The socket is custom made to fit the residual limb and to distribute the forces of the artificial limb across the area of the stump (rather than just one small spot), which helps reduce wear on the stump. The custom socket is created by taking a plaster cast of the stump or, more commonly today, of the liner worn over the stump, and then making a mold from the plaster cast. Newer methods include laser guided measuring which can be input directly to a computer allowing for a more sophisticated design.|$|R
40|$|This {{review is}} an attempt to untangle the {{complexity}} of transtibial prosthetic socket fit and perhaps find some indication of whether a particular prosthetic socket type might be best for a given situation. In addition, we identified knowledge gaps, thus providing direction for possible future research. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, using medical subject headings and standard key words to search for articles in relevant databases. No restrictions were made on study design and type of outcome measure used. From the obtained search results (n = 1, 863), 35 articles were included. The relevant data were entered into a predefined data form that included the Downs and Black risk of bias assessment checklist. This article presents the results from the systematic review of the quantitative outcomes (n = 27 articles). Trends indicate that vacuum-assisted <b>suction</b> <b>sockets</b> improve gait symmetry, volume control, and residual limb health more than other socket designs. Hydrostatic sockets seem to create less inconsistent socket fittings, reducing a problem that greatly influences outcome measures. Knowledge gaps exist in the understanding of clinically meaningful changes in socket fit and its effect on biomechanical outcomes. Further, safe and comfortable pressure thresholds under various conditions should be determined through a systematic approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} {{attachment}} of a prosthesis to the residual limb (suspension system) is a critical issue {{in the process of}} providing prosthesis to an amputee. Proper fit of the stump inside the socket and appropriate selection of prosthetic suspension positively affect the amputees’ gait, distribution of pressure within the socket, and amputees’ satisfaction. This research aimed to: (1) conduct a survey to compare the effects of seal-in liner and common <b>suction</b> <b>socket</b> (CSS) on transfemoral amputees’ satisfaction; (2) compare the effects of the Seal-In liner (suction) and Dermo liner (Pin/lock) on transtibial amputees’ gait performance; and (3) design and evaluate (mechanical testing, pressure mapping, gait evaluation, and satisfaction survey) a new prosthetic suspension system. The survey study showed that the overall satisfaction increased {{with the use of the}} Seal-In liner compared with the CSS (P 0. 05). Evaluation of kinetic data and subjects’ feedback showed that the participants were more confident to use the <b>suction</b> <b>socket,</b> and the sockets were more suitable for walking. However, the participants expressed more complaints with this system because of difficulty in donning and doffing. Factors influenced by the prosthetic suspension system were derived through an extensive systematic literature review, and a new suspension system (Holo) using Velcro or Hook and Loop concept was designed and fabricated. The universal testing machine was used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the designed suspension system. For validation, the Holo was compared with three other common suspension systems, namely, the pin/lock, seal-in, and magnetic suspension system. The maximum tensile load that the new system could iv bear (before failure) was 490 N (SD, 5. 5). However, the pin/lock system could tolerate loading of 580 N (SD, 8. 5). The magnetic (MPSS) and seal-in (suction) could tolerate loads of 350. 9 N (SD, 7. 0) and 310 N (SD, 8. 4), respectively. Comparison (interface pressure) between the pin/lock and the Holo system showed that high pressure was applied to the residual limb at the distal region of the stump by the pin/lock system during ambulation. The new coupling system could distribute the pressure more uniformly over the residual limb. PEQ results indicated that the participants were generally pleased with the new system, particularly with easy donning and doffing procedures. Gait evaluation (case study) demonstrated a slightly higher walking speed and stride length with the new socket with Velcro suspension system than with the pin/lock system. Kinetic results also revealed that the patient were more confident to walk with the Holo system. The Holo suspension system may be used as an alternative suspension system for lower-limb amputees because the biomechanical findings were consistent with the ranges in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-In this study, {{a finite}} element (FE) {{model of a}} below-knee {{prosthesis}} of patellar tendon-bearing (PTB) design, and several altered variations of the model have been constructed. A load of approximately 1. 5 times normal body weight (984 N) was applied at the heel of the model to simulate heelstrike con-ditions. The "base " model was then analyzed and revised iteratively until a model which provided consistency between soft tissue elastic modulus and socket displacement was devel-oped. The interface normal and shear stresses obtained from the analysis of this revised base model were highest (about 961, and 463 KPa, respectively) at the distal anterior tip of the socket/stump. Proximally, higher normal stresses (72 - 78 KPa) were found medially and posteriorly. Proximal shear stresses were highest posteriorly (79 KPa), although shear stresses medially (51 KPa), and laterally (43 KPa), were also much higher than anteriorly (10 KPa). FE analyses were performed on the altered models to determine the relative effects on socket/stump interface stresses of altering the FE, model of the prosthesis. Results of the analysis indicate that fabricating the prosthesis from a material with an elastic modulus ten times {{lower than that of}} the revised base model can produce reductions in the maximum pressure of up to 14 percent. Large decreases in max-imum pressures (71 percent) resulted from the use of a <b>suction</b> <b>socket</b> rather than a conventional socket. Small changes in stump length (2 cm) caused relatively large pressure changes (16 to 18 percent) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{firefighter}} with burn injuries demonstrated fitting challenges regarding {{comfort and}} suspension of a functional upper limb prosthesis. This case study introduces a transhumeral-transfemoral patient who was injured during a volunteer firefighting incident. The patient sustained several injuries {{which resulted in}} amputation of the right leg just proximal to the knee and a transhumeral amputation of the left upper limb. The patient has full range of motion in both shoulders and elbows, yet the strength and dexterity {{of his right hand}} has been compromised. This individual sustained burns to 60 % of his body, including the skin on his left transhumeral residual limb. Due to the delicate nature of his skin, a <b>suction</b> <b>socket</b> was contraindicated. Over the next four years, different types of custom and non-custom locking and cushion liners were utilized for patient comfort and suspension of both a myoelectric and a conventional (body-powered) prosthesis. The integration of electrodes for dual site myoelectric inputs offered additional challenges that compromised the suspension provided by silicone suction. Shuttle locks, lanyards, and proximal locking mechanisms were used, and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each system will be compared. This case study will follow the progression of suspension techniques, interface designs, and other clinical challenges faced by the patient and the clinicians involved with the fitting. As the patient progresses toward his imminent evaluation for Targeted Muscle Reinnervation surgery, his existing design must be modified to allow additional EMG sites. The challenges of this firefighter’s progressive fitting and treatment will be detailed in the discussion...|$|E
40|$|The {{accidental}} {{displacement of}} roots, endodontic materials and dental implants into the maxillary sinus are relatively common complications in dental clinical practice. The {{purpose of this}} study is to present four cases of displaced dental implant into maxillary sinus, their treatment as well as the prevention of this condition. There are three different major approaches to remove materials displaced into the maxillary sinus: <b>suction</b> from the <b>socket</b> of an extracted tooth, the classical open surgery via the canine fossa and endoscopic approach. A relevant improvement of surgical techniques previous to, or in association with, the placement of implants in the posterior maxilla, has tremendously expanded the possibilities and indications for such treatments. To decrease the risk for developing side effects, it is recommended that sinus augmentation procedures should be performed before inserting implants in a resorbed upper jaw where sinus penetration is unavoidable. As implant displacement in the paranasal sinuses may be followed by infectious complications, an immediate or early removal of the displaced implants is indicated...|$|R

Further, it is intended to provide directions for future research. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and used medical subject headings and standard key words to search for articles in relevant databases. No restrictions were made on study design or type of outcome measure. From the obtained search results (n = 1, 863), 35 articles were included. The relevant data were entered into a predefined data form that incorporated the Downs and Black risk of bias assessment checklist. Results for the qualitative outcomes (n = 19 articles) are synthesized. Total surface bearing sockets lead to greater activity levels and satisfaction in active persons with amputation, those with a traumatic cause of amputation, and younger persons with amputation than patellar tendon bearing sockets. Evidence on vacuum-assisted <b>suction</b> and hydrostatic <b>sockets</b> is inadequate, and further studies are much needed. To improve the scientific basis for prescription, comparison of and correlation between mechanical properties of interface material, socket designs, user characteristics, and outcome measures should be conducted and reported in future studies...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 - 12 Lower limb amputees {{are often}} {{dissatisfied}} with the comfort of their prosthesis. A literature review of 38 selected studies revealed that more than 53 % of people with amputation experienced heat and/or perspiration discomfort inside their prostheses. Current prosthetic liners are usually made from silicon, polyurethane or a combination polymer with a fabric outer layer and have thermally insulating properties. Lack of liner breathability and permeability also causes disproportionate amounts of moisture to pool against the skin. A novel new Dynamic Air Exchange (DAE) socket, being evaluated for this study, uses a small vacuum pump and pressure sensor to dynamically maintain a slight vacuum <b>suction</b> in the <b>socket.</b> Air is drawn in through four proximal liner ports, flows distally through a thin sock between the skin and liner, and forces perspiration and water vapor out a port in the prosthesis’ distal locking pin. Analysis includes a computational model to show how heat removal varies in different thermal environments, physical test results from a thermal manikin, and preliminary outcomes from human subject study results (n= 2) comparing adherence between the DAE socket and a standard of care (SoC) pin lock socket. The DAE system removes moisture from the socket effectively but has little effect on overall skin temperature. The computational model suggests that cooling rates for current DAE socket airflow are near 3 W for 20 °C ambient air and 10 % relative humidity. Cooling rates increase to 29 W when the flow velocity is increases from 0. 03 m/s (current DAE) to 0. 5 m/s under the same external conditions. Effects of varying flow velocity, relative humidity, and inlet air temperature on heat transfer rate are also presented...|$|R
