2500|$|Ecosystem {{services}} are {{the benefits that}} humans derive from ecological systems. Today, {{one of the arguments}} for protecting <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> is to increase {{the quality and quantity of}} these services. <b>Salt</b> <b>marshes</b> sequester nitrogen, filtering runoff water and reducing nitrogen input to estuaries (Valiela and Cole 2002). <b>Salt</b> <b>marshes</b> also provide essential refuge habitat for young fish and crustaceans, provisioning coastal fisheries (Boesch and Turner 1984) that account for 90% of the world’s fish catch (UNEP 2006). <b>Salt</b> <b>marshes</b> also sequester carbon, which will be an important ecosystem service as climate change intensifies (Chmura et al. 2003). Arguably the most important ecosystem service <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> provide is to act as natural sea barriers because grasses bind soils, prevent shoreline erosion, attenuate waves, and reduce coastal flooding (Costanza et al. 2008).|$|R

Here we present a review of recent studies on these fluxes and their effects on both ecosystem functioning and morphological evolution of <b>salt</b> <b>marshes.</b> We reexamine a simplified model for the computation of water fluxes in <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> that captures the asymmetry in discharge between flood and ebb. We discuss the role of storm conditions on sediment fluxes both in tidal channels and on the marsh platform. We present recent methods and field instruments for the measurement of fluxes of organic matter. These methods will provide long-term data sets with fine temporal resolution that will help scientists to close the carbon budget in <b>salt</b> <b>marshes.</b> Finally, the main processes controlling fluxes of biogenic and dissolved silica in <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> are explained, with particular emphasis on the uptake by marsh macrophytes and diatoms.|$|R

5|$|Animals {{that are}} {{important}} to the marsh rice rat's diet include insects, fiddler crabs, and snails, but the species is known to eat many other animals, including fish, clams, and juvenile Graptemys and Chrysemys turtles. They scavenge on carcasses of muskrats, deermice, and sparrows, and {{may be the most important}} predator on eggs and young of the marsh wren. Rice rats also eat eggs and young of the seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus) and are aggressive towards the sparrow, apparently leading it to avoid nesting in Juncus in a seaside <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> in Florida. On islands in North Carolina, rice rats consume eggs of Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri). They have been observed preying on alligator eggs in Georgia.|$|E

5|$|Surrounding the {{southern}} part of Lake Okeechobee is the Fort Thompson Formation, made of dense, hard limestone, shells, and sand. Rain water is less likely to erode the limestone to form solution holes—smaller versions of sinkholes that do not intersect with the water table. In this formation the beds are generally impermeable. Underneath the metropolitan areas of Palm Beach County is the Anastasia Formation, composed of shelly limestone, coquina, and sand representing a former mangrove or <b>salt</b> <b>marsh.</b> The Anastasia Formation is much more permeable and filled with pocks and solution holes. The Fort Thompson and Anastasia Formations, and Miami Limestone and (x), were formed during the Sangamon interglacial period.|$|E
5|$|The Pleasure Beach Bridge is a movable Warren through-truss {{bridge in}} Bridgeport, Connecticut.

Its service life came to an end after it was badly damaged by fire in 1996, cutting off access to Pleasure Beach. In the decade following the fire, several bonds to fund a new bridge were proposed, but ultimately fell through. Pleasure Beach has become the subject of debate, whether it will become an undisturbed protected <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> or be revitalized. An alternate method of access via water taxi service, first made possible by a grant in 2009, was not realized until 2013.|$|E

5|$|At Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton {{the wooded}} cliff and a narrow <b>salt</b> <b>marsh</b> are {{supported}} by rocks of Devonian sandstone and Carboniferous limestone, overlain by with Triassic Dolomitic conglomerate. The site's principal interest {{and the reason for}} its designation as an SSSI is the presence of a population of the True Service-tree (Sorbus domestica) growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of Sorbus here are the whitebeams Sorbus eminens and Sorbus anglica, both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally scarce Large-leaved Lime (Tilia platyphyllos) also occurs, and herbs include Field garlic (Allium oleraceum) and Pale St. John's-wort (Hypericum montanum). The saltmarsh vegetation, which lies {{at the base of the}} cliff, is predominantly made up of Sea Aster (Aster tripolium) and English Scurvygrass (Cochlearia anglica). There are however two nationally scarce vascular plant species here as well– Slender Hare's-ear (Bupleurum tenuissimum) and Long-stalked Orache (Atriplex longipes).|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads have {{numerous}} predators, especially {{early in}} their lives. Egg and nestling predators include ghost crabs, oligochaete worms, beetles, fly larvae, ants, parasitoid wasp larvae, flesh flies, snakes, gulls, corvids, opossums, bears, rats, armadillos, mustelids, skunks, canids, procyonids, cats, pigs, and humans. During their migration from their nests to the sea, hatchlings are preyed on by dipteran larvae, crabs, toads, lizards, snakes, seabirds such as frigatebirds, and other assorted birds and mammals. In the ocean, predators of the loggerhead juveniles include fish, such as parrotfish and moray eels, and portunid crabs. Adults are more rarely attacked due to their large size, but may be preyed on by large sharks, seals, and killer whales. Nesting females are attacked by flesh flies, feral dogs, and humans. <b>Salt</b> <b>marsh</b> mosquitos can also pester nesting females.|$|E

5|$|Blakeney Point {{has been}} {{designated}} {{as one of the}} most important sites in Europe for nesting terns by the government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee. In the early 1900s, the small colonies of common and little terns were badly affected by egg-taking, disturbance and shooting, but as protection improved the common terns population rose to 2,000 pairs by mid-century, although it subsequently declined to no more than 165 pairs by 2000, perhaps due to predation. Sandwich terns were a scarce breeder until the 1970s, but there were 4,000 pairs by 1992. Blakeney is the most important site in Britain for both Sandwich and little terns, the roughly 200 pairs of the latter species amounting to eightper cent of the British population. The 2,000 pairs of black-headed gulls sharing the breeding area with the terns are believed to protect the colony as a whole from predators like red foxes. Other nesting birds include about 20 pairs of Arctic terns and a few Mediterranean gulls in the tern colony, ringed plovers and oystercatchers on the shingle and common redshanks on the <b>salt</b> <b>marsh.</b> The waders' breeding success has been compromised by human disturbance and predation by gulls, weasels and stoats, with ringed plovers particularly affected, declining to 12 pairs in 2012 compared to 100 pairs twenty years previously.

40|$|Biotic and {{abiotic stress}} can both be present on <b>salt</b> <b>marshes.</b> Factors as sea level rise and {{anthropogenic}} land use may increase stress and thereby influence ecosystems. Many researches involve {{the consequences of}} abiotic stress on ecosystems, but {{little is known about}} the effects of biotic stress or a combination of the two stress types on ecosystems. The aim of this study was to increase the knowledge about the effects of biotic and abiotic stress on <b>salt</b> <b>marshes.</b> Vegetation patterns are present in <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> and patterns are known to shift under influence of stress. Species are the basic elements of plant communities and their interactions influence the formation of vegetation patterns. The effects of biotic and abiotic stress on species growth, species interactions and patch sizes were tested in this research. Grazing history was used as a measure for biotic stress and salinity as a measure of abiotic stress. Juncus maritimus is a species that forms vegetation patches in <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> at Schiermonnikoog. It was found that Juncus cover was not affected by biotic stress, but was negatively influenced by abiotic stress. Species interactions were influenced by a combination of biotic and abiotic stress. Facilitation increased with biotic stress at low abiotic stress, but did not change with biotic stress at high abiotic stress. Patch sizes were influenced by biotic stress. Large patches were more abundant on <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> with medium and high biotic stress than on <b>salt</b> <b>marshes</b> with low biotic stress.
