25|$|This {{new type}} of {{variable}} assist power steering has since spread throughout the vehicle population. DIRAVI as it was called, allowed great assistance to the motorist while parking, but little assistance at motorway speeds. The system adjusts the hydraulic pressure on the steering centering cam according to vehicle speed so {{that the amount of}} <b>steering</b> <b>feel</b> remained almost constant at any speed, counteracting the tendency of manual and ordinary power assisted steering to feel light at high speed. Thus the car turns easily at low speed, emphasized by high gearing given two turns lock-lock, and relatively more effort is required at higher speed.|$|E
25|$|The chassis {{design was}} as new as the bodies - with an all-new, {{sturdier}} perimeter frame, new chassis/body mounts, larger 8Â½inch rear axle, wider 6-inch wheel rim width, refined rear control arm bushings, increased {{front and rear}} suspension travel, new shock absorber location, and improved front suspension geometry - The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive camber than the right {{which resulted in a}} more uniform and stable <b>steering</b> <b>feel</b> on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 Chevelles. John Z. DeLorean, Chevrolet's dynamic general manager during the design phase of the new Chevelles, left just as they were being announced. He departed in late September 1972 to start a brief stint as vice president of General Motors's Car and Truck Group. DeLorean left the new Chevelle an important legacy, though. He and Alex Mair, then Chevrolet's chief engineer, championed great handling. Critics compared the GM Colonnade line favorably to Ford and Chrysler intermediates which had unattractive styling and less interior room.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2010 Infiniti {{released}} its new performance division, Infiniti Performance Line (IPL). The debut IPL offering is the G37 Coupe for 2011 model year, {{and later the}} G37 Convertible. The IPL models featured a retuned engine producing [...] and 276 tq. Performance improvements included a redesigned exhaust system, sportier suspension tuning, {{as well as a}} more direct <b>steering</b> <b>feel.</b> Design changes were made to the exterior including more aggressive front/rear bumpers and sideskirts, sportier 19 inch alloy wheels, and larger exhaust tips. Inside, the G37 IPL has red Monaco leather seats. The IPL G37 Coupe and Convertible are only available in 2 colours; Graphite Shadow gray metallic and Malbec Black.|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{comprehensive}} program exploring driver/vehicle system response in lateral steering tasks, driver/vehicle system describing functions and other dynamic data have been gathered in several milieu. These include a simple fixed base simulator with an elementary roadway delineation only display; a fixed base statically operating automobile with a terrain model based, wide angle projection system display; and a full scale moving base automobile operating on the road. Dynamic data with the two fixed base simulators compared favorably, implying that the impoverished visual scene, lack of engine noise, and simplified <b>steering</b> wheel <b>feel</b> characteristics in the simple simulator did not induce significant driver dynamic behavior variations. The fixed base vs. moving base comparisons showed substantially greater crossover frequencies and phase margins on the road course...|$|R
50|$|Changes to Continental GT include 35 kg {{reduction}} in kerb weight due primarily to optimisation of suspension and cooling system components, {{increased use of}} aluminium parts in suspension, revised Servotronic power <b>steering</b> for improved <b>feel</b> and feedback, optional fade-resistant carbon ceramic brakes provide improved brake feel (only available on 20-inch wheels), new, more upright front grille and larger lower air intakes give improved airflow to aid engine cooling; chromed headlamp bezels, two new exterior paint colours (Cumbrian Green and Granite), two new leather hide colours (Newmarket Tan and Cumbrian Green), new low-friction dampers, new 'Sport Traction' mode for the Bosch 8.1 ESP system, Bentley 'B' brake pedal.|$|R
5000|$|The {{recirculating}} ball mechanism {{has the advantage}} of a much greater mechanical advantage, so that it was found on larger, heavier vehicles while the rack and pinion was originally limited to smaller and lighter ones; due to the almost universal adoption of power steering, however, this is no longer an important advantage, leading to the increasing use of rack and pinion on newer cars. The {{recirculating ball}} design also has a perceptible lash, or [...] "dead spot" [...] on center, where a minute turn of the steering wheel in either direction does not move the steering apparatus; this is easily adjustable via a screw {{on the end of the}} steering box to account for wear, but it cannot be entirely eliminated because it will create excessive internal forces at other positions and the mechanism will wear very rapidly. This design is still in use in trucks and other large vehicles, where rapidity of <b>steering</b> and direct <b>feel</b> are less important than robustness, maintainability, and mechanical advantage.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2013 Toyota {{announced}} upgrades {{and reduced}} pricing for the 2014 Prius PHV in the Japanese market. The model {{will be offered}} in a new two-tone paint scheme, newly designed aluminium alloy wheels, LED illumination for the [...] "PHV" [...] and [...] "Hybrid Synergy Drive" [...] badges. Interior changes include a padded compartment box {{in the center of}} the dashboard for keeping the smartphone, and some dark wood grain inserts in the center console and the armrests. In addition, Toyota explained that the 2014 Prius Plug-In Hybrid will be manufactured using an improved spot-welding process that results in increased structural rigidity, which will reduce noise and vibration, and improve ride quality and <b>steering</b> <b>feel.</b> The Japanese-market 2014 Prius PHV will be offered in four trim levels: L, S, G and G Leather Package.

50|$|The {{technology}} replaces traditional components {{such as the}} pumps, hoses, fluids, {{belts and}} vacuum servos and master cylinders with electronic sensors and actuators. Drive-by-wire technology in automotive industry replaces the traditional mechanical and hydraulic control systems with electronic control systems using electromechanical actuators and human-machine interfaces such as pedal and <b>steering</b> <b>feel</b> emulators.|$|E
50|$|Ride {{quality and}} {{handling}} {{have always been}} a compromise - technology has over time allowed automakers to combine more of both features in the same vehicle.High levels of comfort are difficult to reconcile with a low center of gravity, body roll resistance, low angular inertia, support for the driver, <b>steering</b> <b>feel</b> and other characteristics that make a car handle well.|$|E
50|$|Changes to US {{models of}} Hyundai Azera include lower {{starting}} price of $31,000 ($1,250 reduction from 2013), refined <b>steering</b> <b>feel</b> and precision, standard 6-inch color LCD audio display with rearview camera, standard driver blind-spot mirror, new electroluminescent gauge cluster with color LCD trip computer, new 8-inch navigation system standard on Limited, power-folding side mirrors standard on Limited, Hyundai Assurance Connected Care telematics services standard for three years.|$|E
50|$|In the 2007 IS models, in {{addition}} to the on/off switch for the traction-control system, Lexus added a roof-mounted shark-fin antenna in some markets. (The Australian delivered IS models did not receive the fin-style antenna until its first appearance on the IS F in 2008). For 2008 models, the steering system was tweaked for improved <b>steering</b> <b>feel</b> and the rear seats were modified to improve rear room.|$|E
50|$|In {{an effort}} to lower the curb weight of the F10 M5, which is heavier than the E60 it replaced, BMW partnered with SGL group, a carbon fiber manufacturer. Despite this, the F10 still weighs {{significantly}} more than the E60 model and has faced criticism from some quarters for this, its relative lack of engine note and lack of <b>steering</b> <b>feel</b> compared to its immediate predecessor.|$|E
5000|$|Some trikes use a {{geometry}} (also called {{center point}} steering) with the kingpin axis intersecting the ground directly {{ahead of the}} tire contact point, producing a normal amount of trail. This arrangement, elsewhere called [...] "zero scrub radius" [...] is used to mitigate the effects of one-sided braking on steering. While zero scrub can reduce <b>steering</b> <b>feel</b> and increase wandering it can also protect novices from spinning out and/or flipping.|$|E
50|$|Unveiled at the 2016 Chicago Auto Show (Q50 2.0t, Q50 3.0t, Q50 Red Sport 400), the 2016 Q50 {{featured}} several updates, {{including the}} introduction of second-generation Direct Adaptive Steering with advanced levels of <b>steering</b> <b>feel</b> and feedback, introduction of Dynamic Digital Suspension (standard on 3.0t models), Drive Mode Selector with Personal mode, standard RACK Electronic Power Steering on 3.0t models, revised suspension settings provide an improved balance between confident handling and a more comfortable ride.|$|E
50|$|There were {{a number}} of changes made to the 2008 IS 250 X model. These included: changes to the {{steering}} system resulting in an improved <b>steering</b> <b>feel,</b> modified rear seats to improve rear room and the added choice of a new exterior colour - Arctic Blue. Lexus Australia also announced that 450 units would be released, compared to the 260 released the previous year. Production of the IS 250 X ceased in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of the BF series, FPV introduced the [...] "R-spec" [...] in limited numbers. The biggest upgrade comprised new suspension dampers supplied by Delphi, which provided better <b>steering</b> <b>feel,</b> turn-in and response without compromising general road comfort. FPV also added a higher capacity oil cooler to automatic transmission models to cater for track use. This upgraded handling package was tested by legendary Australian racing identity John Bowe, who was able to cut 3 seconds a lap over the normal models at Winton Raceway.|$|E
50|$|Drive by wire, DbW, by-wire, Steer-by-wire, or {{x-by-wire}} {{technology in}} the automotive industry {{is the use of}} electrical or electro-mechanical systems for performing vehicle functions traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages. This technology replaces the traditional mechanical control systems with electronic control systems using electromechanical actuators and human-machine interfaces such as pedal and <b>steering</b> <b>feel</b> emulators. Components such as the steering column, intermediate shafts, pumps, hoses, belts, coolers and vacuum servos and master cylinders are eliminated from the vehicle. This is similar to the fly-by-wire systems used widely in the aviation industry.|$|E
5000|$|The RS6 Plus {{came with}} Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) as standard, and also {{included}} a no-cost option of [...] "Sports Suspension Plus", which lowered the standard sports suspension by a further 10 mm over the standard RS6. A revised steering rack, with a reduced ratio of 14.3 for firmer <b>steering</b> <b>feel</b> was included, and resulted in a turning circle of 11.7 m. The brakes now included cross-drilled discs. The wheels were only available in the 9Jx19-inch '5-arm design' alloys, finished in [...] "anthracite" [...] (dark grey), with 255/35 ZR19 96Y XL tyres.|$|E
5000|$|A {{six-speed}} {{manual transmission}} {{is available on}} the Corolla L and S grades. Drive modes that offer re-calibrated throttle, transmission and steering responses are available on the Corolla LE Eco and Corolla S. For ECO drive mode on the LE Eco, the initial throttle inputs are less sensitive to help encourage more fuel-efficient driving and eliminate sudden starts. On the S grade, the SPORT mode software helps make the accelerator pedal feel more responsive to input along with CVTi-S shifting logic that enhances acceleration feel. In sport mode, Corolla's electronic power steering is programmed to offer a more positive <b>steering</b> <b>feel.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{this power}} {{steering}} system, the force steering the wheels {{comes from the}} car's high pressure hydraulic system and {{is always the same}} no matter what the road speed is. Turning the steering wheel moves the wheels simultaneously to a corresponding angle via a hydraulic cylinder. In order to give some artificial <b>steering</b> <b>feel,</b> there is a separate hydraulically operated system that tries to turn the steering wheel back to centre position. The amount of pressure applied is proportional to road speed, so that at low speeds the steering is very light, and at high speeds {{it is very difficult to}} move more than a small amount off centre.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{has also}} undergone major changes, with switches {{such as the}} boot lid release being relocated from the glove box to the doors and the fitting of an electronic handbrake. All models are fitted with an eight-inch touch screen in the centre console, with keyless entry and auto-park assist also being standard across all models. Other features include a heads-up display on the windscreen, forward and rear collision warning systems, blind spot monitors and a lane departure warning system, however these are not standard on all models. The VF uses an electric power steering system, rather than the hydraulic system used on previous Commodores, which is slightly more fuel-economical {{at the cost of}} <b>steering</b> <b>feel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Toyota retuned the {{suspension}} with new damping rates {{to improve the}} ride quality over the previous models. The steering rack was re-valved to improve the <b>steering</b> <b>feel.</b> The Tundra line-up included a new premium luxury model called the 1794. [...] In total, the 2014 Tundra is available in five trim levels, the SR, SR5, Limited, Platinum, and 1794. [...] For the 2014 model year, Toyota discontinued the regular cab Tundra with the 6.5' box, but other configurations remain the same. [...] The 2015 model year saw {{the introduction of the}} TRD PRO model, being marketed as a more capable off-road package. [...] In addition, the 2015 model year saw the 4.0L V6 discontinued.|$|E
50|$|Hub-center {{steering}} systems use an arm, or arms, on bearings {{to allow}} upward wheel deflection, meaning {{that there is}} no stiction, even under braking. Braking forces can be redirected horizontally along these arms, or tie rods, away from the vertical suspension forces, and can even be put to good use to counteract weight shift. Finally, the arms typically form some form of parallelogram which maintains steering geometry over the full range of wheel travel, allowing agility and consistency of steering that forks currently cannot get close to attaining. The hub center steering's Achilles heel, however, has been <b>steering</b> <b>feel.</b> Complex linkages tend {{to be involved in the}} steering process, and this can lead to slack, vague, or inconsistent handlebar movement across its range.|$|E
5000|$|Equalise {{the torque}} better between the driveshafts {{by using a}} low {{friction}} differential. The torque difference is zero if the differential is frictionless, and limited slip differentials, intended to increase power transfer, actually make torque steer much worse. For this reason, limited slip differentials by automobile transmission manufacturers like Quaife, Torsen, TrueTrac, Gold Trac have not been much used until recently, and require other measures to be implemented, such as careful positioning of suspension pivot points and driveshaft CV joints, {{in order to keep}} the resultant torque steer to a manageable amount. Limited slip differentials do not improve cornering, or <b>steering</b> <b>feel,</b> however they will improve power transfer in situations where one wheel experiences limited adhesion, and so may improve overall performance.|$|E
5000|$|The 4C employs double {{wishbone}} suspensions {{at the front}} and MacPherson struts at the rear. The resultant weight distribution is 38% {{on the front and}} 62% on the rear axle. [...] Wheels and tyres have different diameters and widths front and rear: 205/45 R17 front and 235/40 R18 back as standard, with optional 205/40 R18 and 235/35 R19. Both wheel options come equipped with Pirelli P Zero tires. The 4C uses vented disc brakes on all wheels; Brembo 305 mm on the front and 292 mm on the rear. The car can stop from 100 km/h in 36 meters. To save weight and increase <b>steering</b> <b>feel,</b> the 4C has no power steering. Its center of gravity height is 40 cm; lower than the Lotus Elise.|$|E
5000|$|... 2006 Impreza WRX models {{gained some}} chassis and braking system enhancements. On sedan models, {{aluminum}} front suspension lower A-arms reduced unsprung weight. (The rear suspension gained forward aluminum lateral links in the 2005 model year.) The steering rack was updated for improved <b>steering</b> <b>feel</b> and the steering rack ratio {{was changed to}} 15.0:1. On all WRX models, 7-spoke 17 x 7 in aluminum-alloy wheels replaced the previous 5 spoke 16 x 6.5 in wheels. Tires were 215/45ZR17 versus 205/55R16 before. The more powerful brake system employed 11.5 in vented front discs and four-piston calipers instead of the previous versions two-piston calipers. The rear brakes were 11.3 in ventilated discs replacing the previous 10.3 in solid discs, and two-piston calipers replacing single-piston calipers. The calipers are painted red with the SUBARU name in white overlain.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was also}} a Deluxe version, known as the V.R. DX cabinet type, {{which is also a}} single-player machine and has a 16:9 aspect-ratio Hantarex monitor (the first use of a {{widescreen}} aspect ratio monitor in an arcade game), and 6 airbags (3 on each side) built into the seat that will inflate and [...] "nudge" [...] the player when cornering, and one more airbag on the player's back that inflates under braking. The seat is also adjustable via [...] "forward" [...] and [...] "back" [...] buttons using air pressure. V.R. DXs force-feedback steering also uses two pneumatic cylinders to rotate the steering wheel, which differ from the electric motor-and-clutch system that the upright and twin versions use (which have no inbuilt air system), so the <b>steering</b> <b>feel</b> is quite different.|$|E
50|$|A {{solution}} was found - no road feedback at all - the driver points and goes, {{regardless of what}} the driven wheels are experiencing. Hitting a pothole at high speed would not turn the steering wheel in the driver's hands.This new type of variable assist power steering has since spread throughout the vehicle population. DIRAVI as it was called, allowed great assistance to the motorist while parking, but little assistance at motorway speeds. The system adjusts the hydraulic pressure on the steering centering cam according to vehicle speed so that the amount of <b>steering</b> <b>feel</b> remained almost constant at any speed, counteracting the tendency of manual and ordinary power assisted steering to feel light at high speed. Thus the car turns easily at low speed, emphasized by high gearing given two turns lock-lock, and relatively more effort is required at higher speed.|$|E
