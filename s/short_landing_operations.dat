5000|$|Air Pacific was a {{commuter}} airline {{based in the}} United States that operated regional flights wholly within the state of California. Founded as Eureka Aero in 1970, it was renamed Air Pacific in 1979. Its de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and DHC-7 Dash 7 turboprop aircraft were capable of STOL (<b>short</b> takeoff and <b>landing)</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{conceptual}} design {{study was conducted}} to define a representative military and/or commercial tilt-propeller aircraft for <b>short</b> takeoff and <b>landing</b> <b>operation.</b> The level of structural technology selected for the operational aircraft was based on aluminum, steel, titanium, and adhesive bonded structures. The data describe the following: (1) aircraft weight, (2) performance and stability, (3) aerodynamic noise, (4) dynamic characteristics, (5) maintainability and reliability, and (6) operating economics...|$|R
50|$|A STOLport or STOLPORT was {{an airport}} {{designed}} with STOL (<b>Short</b> Take-Off and <b>Landing)</b> <b>operations</b> in mind, usually for an aircraft class of its weight and size. The term STOLport {{did not appear}} to be in common usage as of 2008. A STOLport normally had a short single runway, in general shorter than 5000 ft. STOLports only accepted certain types of aircraft, often only smaller propeller aircraft, often with limits on the amount of fuel that can be taken. In the United States, short runway facilities are simply known as airports and the term STOLport has not been commonly used since the early 1970s.|$|R
50|$|The Sedan was {{designed}} to be a docile airplane but also a good performer. Pilots found that the Sedan, with its large interior, had plenty of room for baggage and passengers. With its large wing, it had good takeoff performance, and was capable of <b>short</b> takeoff and <b>landing</b> <b>operations.</b> It found a niche as a personal aircraft and in commercial bush flying roles; it could also be equipped for agricultural work. Though the commercial roles have been largely taken over by more modern designs, many Sedans remain in use as personal airplanes. Their ongoing operation is aided by the availability of support from the design owner.|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of studies conducted in the area adjacent to the airport located in Poznan, to determine the impact of aircraft <b>landing</b> <b>operation</b> on the concentration of particulate matter. Measurements were carried out using Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer Spectrometer 3090, enabling the measurement of the particle size distribution. The research allowed to determine the nature of the emitted particles and adds to the evaluation of impact on air quality. The tests were carried out during four aircraft <b>landing</b> <b>operations.</b> In each of the four cases total concentration of particulates number before landing (reference level) and during the landing of the aircraft was measured. In addition, the size distribution of reference level particles and its change after the <b>landing</b> <b>operation</b> was measured. Based on the conducted research, it was found that landing aircrafts {{have a significant impact on}} the concentration of particulate matter in the area adjacent to the airport. A single <b>landing</b> <b>operation</b> causes an substantially increase of the value of particle number concentration...|$|R
50|$|Initial Finnish naval assets however {{consisted}} of small motor boats {{which had been}} small enough to be transported from Finland overland. These were used already on 16-17 August 1941 to mount a <b>landing</b> <b>operation</b> on Markatsiman (ru: Ostrov Markatsiman-Sari) island which was lightly defended and fell quickly. Next notable action was the Finnish <b>landing</b> <b>operation</b> on the Rahmansaari island on 7-10 September. While the initial <b>landing</b> <b>operation</b> was successful the strong Soviet naval response and Soviet reinforcements which managed to reach the island prolonged the operation. Finnish artillery managed to prevent further Soviet naval support to the land forces which led to surrender of the remaining 130 Soviet soldiers on 10 September. Finns had intended to mount further <b>landing</b> <b>operations</b> to secure the island of Valamo but Soviets withdrew from there {{as well as from}} most of the other island on the lake voluntarily. Finnish forces took control of the island of Valamo on 20 September and island of Konevitsa on 25 September.|$|R
