In this work reflectance spectra were measured in laboratory for the leaves of three tomato cultivars. Good correlation with analytically measured pigment concentration was achieved for (1) chlorophyll a concentration and reverse reflectance values at wavelength 600 nm for the direct leaf side, (2) anthocyanins concentration and reverse reflectance values at wavelength 550 nm for the reverse leaf <b>side.</b> <b>Reflectance</b> spectroscopy has an advantage over any analytical techniques in possibility to measure the pigment distribution between leaf sides...|$|E
30|$|Figure  3 also {{displayed}} the transmittance of PDMS films {{with and without}} nanostructures measured {{as a function of}} wavelength. From Fig.  3, we can learn that the surface reflectance of the PDMS film with nanocone cluster microstructures keeps higher transmittance values in long wavelength range compared to the flat PDMS films. PDMS films with aspect ratio of 2 show the best transmission of light in the long wavelength. This is because higher aspect ratio nanocones will provide a smoother gradient of effective refractive index, increase light scattering, and suppress front <b>side</b> <b>reflectance.</b> However, too high aspect ratio structure has lower specific surface area, which is not good for light transmittance. That is why we choose PDMS films with aspect ratio 2 for further studies.|$|E
40|$|Major {{uncertainties}} {{exist for}} observing and modeling ice content inside deep convective clouds (DCC). One {{of the difficulties}} has been the lack of characterization of vertical profiles of cloud hydrometeor phase. Here we propose a technique to estimate the DCC glaciation temperature using passive remote sensing data. It {{is based on a}} conceptual model of vertical hydrometeor size profiles inside DCCs. Estimates from the technique agree well with our general understanding of the problem. Furthermore, the link between vertical profiles of cloud particle size and hydrometeor thermodynamic phase is confirmed by a 3 - 13 cloud retrieval technique. The technique is applied to aircraft measurements of cloud <b>side</b> <b>reflectance</b> and the result was compared favorably with an independent retrieval of thermodynamic phase based on different refractive indices at 2. 13 micron and 2. 25 micron. Possible applications of the technique are discussed...|$|E

The spoke of greater interest (Spoke 1) can be traced from its first appearance on the morning and to its terminal dispersion on the evening <b>side.</b> Orbital velocities, <b>reflectances,</b> and reflectance profiles are reported. The behavior of Spoke 1 conforms to the plasma cloud model of spoke formation and evolution proposed by Goertz and Morfill (1983).

40|$|International audiencePredicting {{simultaneously}} {{the spectral}} reflectance and transmittance of rec-to-verso prints is made easier {{thanks to a}} flux transfer matrix model. In the case where the printing support is symmetrical, i. e., its two sides are similar, the model can be calibrated from 44 halftone colors printed on the recto <b>side,</b> whose spectral <b>reflectances</b> and transmittance are measured. Color predictions are then allowed for any recto-verso halftone print illuminated on either side, and the inverse approach can be addressed: we can compute the digital layout for the recto and verso side that, once printed, can display different images according to the illuminated side...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{combined}} spectrophotometric method {{is used to}} analyzed As-S chalcogenide thin films. This method {{is based on the}} simultaneous interpretation of experimental data corresponding to the reflectance from the ambient <b>side,</b> <b>reflectance</b> from the substrate side and transmittance of the chalcogenide films deposited onto the glass substrate. It is shown that this method is usable for the optical characterization of the chalcogenide films even when these films exhibit an inhomogeneity formed by a refractive index profile. Within this method our dispersion model of the optical constants of amorphous materials is used. This means that the values of the dispersion parameters determining the spectral dependences of the optical constants of the As-S chalcogenide material are evaluated. In the paper the advantages of the combined method mentioned are discussed from the practical point of view...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work {{is related}} to a {{detailed}} study {{on the influence of}} the quality of solar cell texturing on the electrical performance after encapsulation. The effect of texturing on cells front <b>side</b> <b>reflectance</b> was studied for alkaline texturing on Cz wafer materials and processes, acidic textured Cz wafers as well as polished Cz wafers and correlated to the electrical characteristics after encapsulation. The electrical performance on module level was studied indoor at STC (standard test conditions) with varying incident light angles and outdoor during one year of outdoor exposure at a location in southern Germany. To consider for optical effects of glass surface on module performance solar glass with various deep surface texture resp. a flat surface (float glass) were processed and characterized. We show that the degree of texturing hence the front side cell reflection has a small influence on the electrical performance after encapsulation with no measurable incident light angle dependency. Furthermore do we show that even for various textured glasses the cell texturing has no effect on the module performance, neither at STC nor at varying incident light angles. The annual electrical yield study revealed even a better performance for the acidic textured cell modules if compared to the alkaline (hence well textured) cell modules...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmittance}} and reflectance of superconductive YBa 2 Cu 307. s (YBCO) {{thin films}} deposited on Si substrates have been {{measured in the}} far-infrared frequency region from 10 to 100 cm' 1 (wavelength from 1000 to 100 pm) at temperatures between 10 and 300 K. The effects of interference, optical resonance, and antireflection on the radiative properties of high-temperature superconducting (HTSC) films are observed and quanti-tatively analyzed. Furthermore, we have measured the reflectance of the HTSC film-substrate composites for radiation incident on the substrate <b>side</b> (backside <b>reflectance)</b> for the first time. The backside reflectance increases significantly from the normal state to the superconducting state at certain frequencies; this experimentally demonstrates that HTSC films {{can be used to}} build far-infrared intensity modulators. The complex refractive index of the YBCO films is determined from the measured transmittance using the Drude model in the normal state and a two-fluid model in the superconducting state. The complex refractive index obtained from this study is useful for various applications of YBCO films, including radiation modulators, detectors, and Fabry-Perot resonators. ...|$|R
40|$|From the {{detailed}} balance between absorbed and emitted radiation follows the efficiency limit of Shockley and Queisser (SQ-limit). In {{the framework of}} the SQ-theory, the exact working principle and the transport mechanism in the solar cell are irrelevant. The efficiency is only determined by the absorptance and emissivity of the material, which are equal according to Kirchhoff’s law. This abstraction from all internal properties of the solar cell makes the SQ-theory general, however, it also implies a fundamental difference between the SQ-theory and typical device simulators, which base on the solution of the continuity equations for charge carrier transport. The present dissertation presents a model, which is compatible with the SQ-theory and which includes the internal details of the device like e. g. charge carrier transport. The simplest version of the model solves the continuity equations for electrons and holes as well as the Poisson equation and allows thereby to simulate inorganic pn and pin-junction solar cells. This model is used for instance to calculate the mobility dependent efficiency limit of SiO 2 /Si superlattice absorbers. To allow simulations of organic solar cells, the model has to include the continuity equation for excitons, which are relevant in organic materials due to the higher exciton binding energy. The special geometry of organic solar cells, which usually consist of a bulk heterojunction, is also considered. The model for organic polymer-fullerene solar cells allows both the reproduction of experimental data on current/voltage and quantum efficiency measurements and the prediction of the device behaviour as a function of mobility, band offsets and the geometry of the phase separation. The final version of the model also includes the effect of multiple exciton generation, meaning the creation of multiple electron/hole pairs or excitons from a single high energy photon. The model for multiple exciton generating absorber layers allows the identification of possible bottlenecks as well as the calculation of efficiency limits for future solar cell concepts. The experimental part of this thesis uses a reciprocity theorem between electroluminescence (EL) emission and the photovoltaic quantum efficiency, which is a direct consequence of the principle of detailed balance. EL measurements of crystalline silicon, Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 and GaInP/GaInAs/Ge triple cells were carried out and interpreted {{with the help of the}} reciprocity theorem. In case of crystalline silicon, the focus was on the investigation of recombination and light trapping with spectrally and spatially resolved EL. First the relation between EL and quantum efficiency is verified experimentally before the application for the extraction of diffusion lengths and back <b>side</b> <b>reflectances</b> is presented. Temperature dependent measurements of Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 solar cells characterize the devices with respect to their stoichiometric inhomogeneity, which may lead to a detrimental lateral variation of the band gap. The EL measurements show that there is no significant inhomogeneity in high efficiency samples. In case of multijunction solar cells, EL measurements give access to the internal voltages of the individual subcells in the stack. By varying the injection current and detecting the spectral EL emission, this method allows determining the amount of non-radiative recombination and the diode quality factors of each individual cell...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{enhanced}} {{chemical etching}} of silicon wafers {{has been successfully}} carried out at atmospheric pressure. The etching process was developed using a linear extended DC arc with a working width of 150 mm for plasma activation. The technology operates in a remote (downstream) mode. The experimental set-up allows continuous processing which is advantageous in terms of in-line capability and consequently reduced effort for substrate handling. Fluorine radicals generated downstream of the plasma source from CHF 3, CF 4, C 2 F 6, C 4 F 8, SF 6, NF 3, CHF 3 /O 2, C 2 F 6 /O 2 and SF 6 /O 2 have been successfully utilized to etch (100) -mono-Si wafers. Static etch rates of over 11 micron/min and dynamic etch rates of 1. 5 micronxm/min have been obtained with NF 3. SEM images of the etched silicon wafers exhibit different surface morphologies such as pyramids of several microns size or nano structured surfaces with high aspect ratio, strongly depending on process conditions and etch precursors used. The reactive plasma {{was used to remove}} the rear side emitter and provide for edge isolation of crystalline Si solar cells. Results comparable to established wet chemical etch processes were achieved. Plasma chemical etching at atmospheric pressure can also be introduced into other steps for continuous solar wafer processing. One promising step is surface texturing in order to decrease front <b>side</b> silicon <b>reflectance.</b> Different substrate textures, i. e. pyramids of some microns and nano structures with high aspect ratio have been obtained leading to substantial decreased reflectance. Furthermore the feasibility of both saw damage etching and phosphorsilicate glass removal have been demonstrated. The PSG (Phosphorsilicate-glass) etching rate is strongly dependent on both etchant selection and plasma parameters used. The PSG rate can be factor 10 to 100 higher against the etch rate of the doped silicon wafer. The underlying plasma equipment is characterized by low footprint requirements and is well suited for in-line integration into both existing lines and newly designed lines...|$|R
