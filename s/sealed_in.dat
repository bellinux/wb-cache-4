5|$|Argon {{is used to}} {{displace}} oxygen- and moisture-containing air in packaging material to extend the shelf-lives of the contents (argon has the European food additive code E938). Aerial oxidation, hydrolysis, and other chemical reactions that degrade the products are retarded or prevented entirely. High-purity chemicals and pharmaceuticals are sometimes packed and <b>sealed</b> <b>in</b> argon.|$|E
5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round bale silage is a term for grass <b>sealed</b> <b>in</b> {{airtight}} plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States. Because haylage {{is a type of}} silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely <b>sealed</b> <b>in</b> plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E

She is ranked at the very bottom under her friend, Uri-tan. She must battle and get all 12 seals to become an Eto-shin.

40|$|LecturePg. 9 - 14 The {{rotating}} equipment industry's ever-increasing demand for efficient, {{safe and reliable}} seal elements {{has resulted in the}} application of mechanical <b>seals</b> <b>in</b> turbomachinery at very high face speeds. In addition to the commonly known installation of mechanical <b>seals</b> <b>in</b> fluid handling systems, such as heavy duty centrifugal pumps, applications have been extended in recent years to centrifugal compressors and gas turbines. Mechanical <b>seals</b> <b>in</b> seawater and NGL injection pumps in oilfield applications are operating currently with face speeds up to 50 meters per second (m/s). In some cases, mechanical <b>seals</b> <b>in</b> centrifugal compressors used in the petrochemical industry have exceeded face speeds of 100 m/s. The desirable features unique to mechanical seals-controlled axial forces with low leakage rates and acceptable power consumption-lead to state of the art development {{in order to meet the}} needs of efficient, reliable turbomachinery. It is the purpose of this paper to introduce the basic design considerations for high speed mechanical <b>seals</b> <b>in</b> this particular industry...|$|R
50|$|In 1982, Sea Shepherd {{interfered}} with the hunting of grey <b>seals</b> <b>in</b> Ireland. They prevented boats from landing and took clubs and rifles away from the sealers.

5|$|Land was {{purchased}} by the local council in 1951 for a memorial hall to commemorate those {{who served in the}} two world wars. Built largely using volunteer labour and working bees, the hall opened on 9 December 1953. The buildings in Whitemore are constructed either side of the only road through the town. The town section of this road was <b>sealed</b> <b>in</b> 1953.|$|E
5|$|Males attract mates by {{constructing}} specially-shaped tunnels {{in which}} they sing. Mating {{takes place in the}} male's burrow; the male may widen a tunnel {{to make room for the}} female to mount, though in some species mating is tail-to-tail. Females lay their eggs either in their normal burrows or in specially-dug brood chambers which are sealed when complete in the case of the genus Neoscapteriscus or not <b>sealed</b> <b>in</b> the case of genera Gryllotalpa and Neocurtilla.|$|E

5|$|Rubidium reacts violently {{with water}} and can cause fires. To ensure safety and purity, this metal is usually kept under a dry mineral oil or <b>sealed</b> <b>in</b> glass {{ampoules}} in an inert atmosphere. Rubidium forms peroxides on exposure even to small amount of air diffused into the oil, and storage is subject to similar precautions as the storage of metallic potassium.|$|E
5|$|According to the Ananda Ramayana, king Padmaksha had a {{daughter}} named Padma - an incarnate of the goddess Lakshmi. When her marriage is organized, Rakshasas (demons) kill the king. The grief-stricken Padma jumps into fire. Ravana discovers her body, which had turned into five jewels, in the fire and takes it to Lanka <b>sealed</b> <b>in</b> a box. Mandodari opens the box and finds Padma inside it. She advises Ravana to cast off the box containing the ill-fated Padma, who led to the doom of her father. When {{the lid of the}} box is closed, Padma curses Ravana that she will return to Lanka and cause his doom. Ravana buries the box in the city of Janaka, who discovers Padma and brings her up as Sita.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, Girdap was {{deprived}} of its government protections, {{as it had}} no links to the new agrarian government of Aleksandar Stamboliyski. In 1919 Boncho Bonev was imprisoned in Berkovitsa for eight months before he was acquitted, Ivan Kovachev was put on trial, and the bank's funds were <b>sealed.</b> <b>In</b> 1922, the Bulgarian National Bank closed Girdap's account, causing 38 million leva of deposits in Girdap to be withdrawn by 1923 and its debtors (including members of Girdap's management) to protest their bills. While {{at the time the}} Bulgarian National Bank, Girdap's most important creditor, was opposed to Girdap's declaration of bankruptcy, it reversed its stance two years later. Girdap was declared bankrupt on 3 February 1925 and its managers Boncho Boev, Ivan Kovachev and Nikola Kovachev were arrested.|$|E

He sees Hoffman brought into the morgue in a body bag and tries to warn Palmer, but an automatic turret gun rises up and kills him along with his men. Hoffman kills Dr. Heffner, Palmer, and everyone else in his path to Jill, who briefly escapes before she is caught and knocked unconscious. He straps her to a chair and locks a reverse bear trap to her head; she awakens as the timer starts and is killed when the trap activates, tearing her face apart and bleeding profusely.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{maintained}} {{the reputation of}} an outsider during his lifetime, both {{in his own country}} and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the international repertoire, accelerating in popularity from the 1960s through Leonard Bernstein and others. In Denmark, Nielsen's reputation was <b>sealed</b> <b>in</b> 2006 when three of his compositions were listed by the Ministry of Culture amongst the twelve greatest pieces of Danish music. For many years, he appeared on the Danish hundred-kroner banknote. The Carl Nielsen Museum in Odense documents his life and that of his wife. Between 1994 and 2009 the Royal Danish Library, sponsored by the Danish government, completed the Carl Nielsen Edition, freely available online, containing background information and sheet music for all Nielsen's works, many of which had not been previously published.|$|E

Several months later, as the Americans {{consolidated}} their forces to prepare for the main invasion of Luzon, nearly 150Americans were executed by their Japanese captors on December14, 1944 at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp on the island of Palawan. These Americans were herded into air-raid shelters, <b>sealed</b> <b>in,</b> doused with gasoline, and burned alive. One of the survivors, PFC Eugene Nielsen, recounted his tale to U.S. Army Intelligence on January7, 1945. Two days later, MacArthur's forces landed on Luzon and began a rapid advance towards the capital, Manila.|$|E

5|$|The first {{community}} hall at Meander {{was built}} in 1914.

Funding from the hall came from, competitions, dances and the growing of peas for sale. The hall opened 3 December 1954 and was physically joined to the original c.1957. The Road from Deloraine to Meander was <b>sealed</b> <b>in</b> 1964, an event of some note that was celebrated with a gymkhana and fair. Mains electricity reached Meander in 1952 when power, supplied by the Hydro-Electric Commission, was switched on in Meander's township area December 1952.

5|$|The inner German border {{was never}} entirely <b>sealed</b> <b>in</b> {{the fashion of}} {{the border between the}} two Koreas and could be crossed in either {{direction}} throughout the Cold War. The post-war agreements on the governance of Berlin specified that the Western Allies were to have access to the city via defined air, road, rail and river corridors. This was mostly respected by the Soviets and East Germans, albeit with periodic interruptions and harassment of travellers. Even during the Berlin Blockade of 1948, supplies could be brought in by air– the famous Berlin Airlift. Before and after the blockade, Western civilian and military trains, road traffic and barges routinely passed through East Germany en route to Berlin.|$|E
