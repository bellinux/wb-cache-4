25|$|The linear {{format of}} the neon light source lends itself to centre high-mount <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> installation, and neon lights offer the same nearly instant rise time as LEDs. However, neon tubes require a ballast.|$|E
25|$|Effective {{with the}} 1986 model year, the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Transport Canada {{mandated}} that all new passenger cars come {{equipped with a}} CHMSL. The requirement was extended to light trucks and vans for the 1994 model year. Early studies involving taxicabs and other fleet vehicles found that a third, high-level <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> reduced rear-end collisions by about 50%. Once the novelty effect wore off as most vehicles on the road came to be equipped with the central third <b>stop</b> <b>lamp,</b> the crash-avoidance benefit declined. However, it did not decline to zero, and a CHMSL is so inexpensive to incorporate into a vehicle {{that it is a}} cost-effective collision avoidance feature even at the long-term enduring crash-reduction benefit of 4.3%.|$|E
25|$|The 1952 Volkswagen Bus was {{equipped}} with only one <b>stop</b> <b>lamp,</b> mounted centrally and higher than {{the left and right}} rear lamps which did not produce a <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> function. The 1968–1971 Ford Thunderbird could be ordered with optional supplemental high-mounted stop and turn signal lights integrated into the left and right interior trim surrounding the backglass. The Oldsmobile Toronado from 1971 to 1978, and the Buick Riviera from 1974 to 1976 had similar dual high-mounted supplemental stop/turn lights as standard equipment; these were located {{on the outside of the}} vehicle below the bottom of the backglass. This type of configuration was not widely adopted at the time. Auto and lamp manufacturers in Germany experimented with dual high-mount supplemental stop lamps in the early 1980s, but this effort, too, failed to gain wide popular or regulatory support.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{methods of}} severe-braking {{indication}} {{have also been}} implemented; some Volvo models make the <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> brighter, and some BMWs have [...] "Adaptive Brake Lights" [...] that effectively {{increase the size of}} the stop lights under severe braking by illuminating the tail lamps at brighter-than-normal intensity. As long as the brighter-than-normal <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> are within the regulated maximum intensity for <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> in general, this kind of implementation does not require specific regulatory approval since the <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> are under all conditions operating in accord with the general regulations on <b>stop</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
25|$|One {{potential}} problem with flashing <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> in the United States (and Canada) is the regulations that permit flashing <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> {{to be used}} in lieu of separate rear turn signal and hazard warning lamps.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate whether dedicated <b>stop</b> <b>lamps,</b> in comparison to <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> that are functionally combined with tail or turn signals, provide additional safety benefits at night. The analysis compared the frequencies of rear-end collisions in which the vehicles were struck to those collisions in which the same vehicles were the striking ones. The analysis used 1999 - 2003 Florida and North Carolina crash data. The vehicle sample consisted of 38 passenger car models for the years 1994 - 2003. Overall, the results include a statistically significant pattern that suggests a beneficial effect of dedicated <b>stop</b> <b>lamps.</b> However, the results are complex and further analyses should be done to better understand the possible effect of dedicated versus combined <b>stop</b> <b>lamps...</b>|$|R
25|$|Minor changes {{occurred}} from 1986 to 89, {{including new}} paint colors, a center high mount <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> (CHMSL) midway through 1986 for North American models, a {{move away from}} the fade-prone brown carpet and new turn signal levers. Some 1988 models featured automatic seatbelts that extended from a large device between the front seats.|$|E
25|$|The CHMSL is {{intended}} to provide a warning to drivers whose view of the vehicle's left and right stop lamps is blocked by interceding vehicles. It also provides a redundant stop light signal {{in the event of}} a <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> malfunction. In North America where rear turn signals are permitted to emit red light, the CHMSL also helps to disambiguate brake lights from rear position lights and turn signal lights.|$|E
25|$|Neon lamp tubes were {{introduced}} into series production for the centre high-mount <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> on the 1995 Ford Explorer. Notable later uses included the 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII with a neon tube spanning {{the width of}} the trunk decklid, and the BMW Z8, which made extensive use of neon. Concept cars such as those from Volvo have included neon lamp features. Hella offered an aftermarket neon CHMSL in the late 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Proponents of twin rear {{fog lamps}} say two lamps provide vehicle {{distance}} information not available from a single lamp. Proponents of the single rear fog lamp say dual {{rear fog lamps}} closely mimic the appearance of illuminated stop lamps (which are mandatorily installed in pairs), reducing the conspicuity of the stop lamps' message when the rear fogs are activated. To provide some safeguard against rear fog lamps being confused with stop lamps, UN Regulation 48 requires a separation of at least 10cm between the closest illuminated edges of any <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> and any rear fog lamp.|$|E
25|$|Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{are being}} used with {{increasing}} frequency in automotive lamps. They offer very long service life, extreme vibration resistance, and can permit considerably shallower packaging compared to most bulb-type assemblies. LEDs also offer a potential safety benefit when employed in stop lights, because when power is applied they rise to full intensity approximately 250 milliseconds (¼ second) faster than incandescent bulbs. This fast rise time not only improves the intentional conspicuity of the <b>stop</b> <b>lamp,</b> but could also provide following drivers with increased time {{to react to the}} appearance of the stop lamps. However, this faster rise time has not been shown to make cars with LED stop lamps less likely to be struck from behind.|$|E
25|$|Conspicuity for {{the rear}} of a vehicle is {{provided}} by rear position lamps (also called tail lamps or tail lights). These are required to produce only red light and to be wired such that they are lit whenever the front position lamps are lit, including when the headlamps are on. Rear position lamps may be combined with the vehicle's stop lamps or separate from them. In combined-function installations, the lamps produce brighter red light for the <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> function and dimmer red light for the rear position lamp function. Regulations worldwide stipulate minimum intensity ratios between the bright (stop) and dim (rear position) modes, so that a vehicle displaying rear position lamps will not be mistakenly interpreted as showing stop lamps, and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E
2500|$|Red steady-burning rear lights, {{brighter}} than the rear position lamps, are activated when the driver applies the vehicle's brakes. These are formally called stop lamps in technical standards and regulations [...] and in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, though informally they are sometimes called [...] "brake lights". They are required to be fitted in multiples of two, symmetrically at {{the left and right}} edges of the rear of every vehicle. International UN regulations specify a range of acceptable intensity for a <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> of 60 to 185 candela. In North America where the UN regulations are not recognised, the acceptable range for a single-compartment <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> is 80 to 300 candela.|$|E

2500|$|... {{devices are}} the lamps and reflectors {{that make a}} vehicle {{conspicuous}} and visible with respect to its presence, position, direction of travel, change in direction or deceleration. Such lamps may burn steadily, blink, or flash, depending on their intended and regulated function.

40|$|In {{the year}} 1984, SWOV Institute for RoaedSafety Research first {{examined}} various studies into {{the impact of}} high-mounted <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> on road safety.

However, the reliability of these figures is doubted. It is impossible to predict the impact for the Netherlands in percentage terms, because of: (1) the effect of the compulsory introduction of high-mounted stop lights varied greatly between the various American states; and (2) the rear light configuration of European cars is different from that of American vehicles. Laboratory tests were used to calculate the effect of high-mounted stoplamps in a scenario where rear lamps were left permanently switched on during the day. High-mounted <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> would probably have a positive impact in the Netherlands. Neither compulsory introduction nor prohibition of these lamps was recommended...|$|R

2500|$|In Europe {{and other}} {{countries}} adhering to UN Regulation 48, vehicles must be equipped {{with one or two}} bright red [...] "rear fog lamps", which serve as high-intensity rear position lamps to be turned on by the driver in conditions of poor visibility to make the vehicle more visible from the rear. The allowable range of intensity for a rear fog lamp is 150 to 300 candela, which is within the range of a U.S. <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> (brake light). Rear fog lamps are not required equipment in the U.S., but they are permitted, and are found almost exclusively on European-brand vehicles in North America. Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes, MINI, Land Rover, Porsche, Saab and Volvo provide functional rear fog lights on their North American models. Some vehicles from non-European brands which are adaptions of European-market offerings, such as the first generation Ford Transit Connect, come standard with rear fog lights, or vehicles with European market counterparts, such as the second generation Chrysler 300, have an option for them. The final generation Oldsmobile Aurora also had dual rear fog lights installed in the rear bumper as standard equipment.|$|E
