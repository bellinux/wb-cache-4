It wasn't any {{surprise}} to Haywood that soldiers <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> {{in the interests of the}} employers; he had seen that situation before. But when the Colorado legislature acknowledged the complaints of organized labor and passed an eight hour law, the Colorado supreme court declared it unconstitutional. So the WFM took the issue to the voters, and 72 percent of the state's voters approved the referendum. But the Colorado government ignored the results of the referendum.|$|E

However, corporate earnings per share were a meager 27 cents per share, the lowest since AMC made its famous compact car comeback in 1958. Investors received a message of the changing fortune of the automaker when the company's 1966 annual financial report was delivered in a plain brown wrapper, instead of the previous year's glossy cover.|$|E
25|$|However, {{having been}} the {{backbone}} of the revolution, over the next four weeks the unit found itself in a significantly different position. It is unclear whether this was {{due to the fact that}} it failed to cooperate with the military putsch planned for 6 December and had deposed its commander who was a part of it. Or whether the division was an obstacle to Quartermaster General Wilhelm Groener's plan to restore law and order to Berlin. From the middle of December, Wels <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> towards the dissolution of the unit. There were complaints about art treasures having been stolen from the palace. The temporary government of the Rat der Volksbeauftragten (Council of People's Deputies) now ordered the division to move to new quarters outside of Berlin and to reduce the number of soldiers to 600 from the current level of around 1,000. To force them to comply, Wels held back their pay. During the week before Christmas the division and Wels negotiated in the Kommandantur, but failed to resolve the situation.|$|E

500|$|In Aesthetic Realism {{classes and}} lessons, Koppelman learned that ethical {{problems}} are also artistic problems. [...] He felt his work {{suffered from a}} fight between rigidity and flexibility. He learned he could go after precision in the studio as penance for being careless at other times, wanting {{to get away from}} things. [...] As freedom and order, truth and imagination became more integrated in his life, his art became more imaginative. “I had always had a classical bent in my work,” he wrote. “But there was also a wildness in me that had not come into my work sufficiently or gracefully.” As a result of his study, Koppelman noted, “Tightness and abandon, the classical and the wild, even the conservative and the rebel <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> better together” resulting in art that was “more imaginative, freer in concept” [...] Boldness of imagination and an unerring sense of detail were two qualities Koppelman’s work became noted for.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{character}} development of Shane in the episode, {{as well as}} the execution of Otis. Nate Rawlings of Time felt that it was a dark moment for the series, and felt that it added anticipation to future development. He wrote: [...] "At some point, Shane will have to come clean with Rick about what happened to Otis. Given Rick’s extremely rigid morale [...] code and Shane’s now demonstrated willingness {{to do whatever it takes}} to survive, the showdown promises to be bigger than just a battle of two alpha males. The Rick/Shane divide is a battle of two leaders with different ideas of humanity and survival." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger opined that [...] "both the multi-layered opening [...] illustrates how Shane’s impulsive nature makes him a valuable if ruthless warrior." [...] Handlen appreciated the character development of Shane, writing, [...] "Shane has long been the dark horse of the group, the one most likely to go off the morality reservation, and this reveal works well to bring him that much closer to darkness. It's not the subtlest moment [...] but, given how friendly and cool Otis was, and given how well the two <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> together, it's a strong twist." [...] He added that because of the death of Otis, the show now has a sense of direction. [...] "His decision to sacrifice Otis is easy enough to rationalize; somebody had to get back for Carl's sake, Shane was faster, and both of them probably weren't going to make it. That's the beauty of it. In a certain light, he made the right choice." [...] Morgan Jeffrey wrote: [...] "This week's installment delivered even more scares than usual — Shane's escape from the high school was almost unbearably tense." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 21, 1918 the German Armies {{attacked}} {{all along}} the Western front {{with the goal of}} breaking the Allied lines before American forces could land in Europe; the Spring Offensive (Kaiserschlacht or Kaiser's Battle), which started with Operation Michael. [...] Three days later the tactic <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> as General Sir Hubert Gough's Fifth Army was overwhelmed and it seemed quite likely that the Germans would break through the French and British lines. This was made possible largely {{due to the lack of}} coordination between French army commander General Philippe Pétain and British commander Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig.|$|E

2500|$|Common {{themes in}} his thought can, however, be {{identified}} and discussed. His earliest work emphasized the opposition of Apollonian and Dionysian impulses in art, and the figure of Dionysus continued {{to play a role}} in his subsequent thought. Other major currents include the will to power, the claim that God is dead, the distinction between master and slave moralities, and radical perspectivism. Other concepts appear rarely, or are confined to one or two major works, yet are considered centerpieces of Nietzschean philosophy, such as the Übermensch and the thought of eternal recurrence. His later works involved a sustained attack on Christianity and Christian morality, and he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> toward what he called the transvaluation of all values (Umwertung aller Werte). [...] While Nietzsche is often associated in the public mind with fatalism and nihilism, Nietzsche himself viewed his project as the attempt to overcome the pessimism of Arthur Schopenhauer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{report also}} noted that {{although}} the front-end and rear-end crews {{should have been in}} regular communication, that {{did not appear to be}} the case in this accident. [...] As the freight train reached Hargwen, Hudson radioed back to Smith that the signals were green, a communication that was heard by a following freight. [...] As it ran towards Dalehurst there was no evidence of further communication. [...] As the conductor is in charge of the train, had Smith felt that the train was out of control or there were serious problems, he should have pulled the brake cord in the caboose to stop the train. [...] However, Smith, who appeared to be nervous while testifying, said that he did not feel that the freight was ever out of control, misjudging its speed. [...] He also testified that he attempted to radio Hudson on two radios and several channels, but neither <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working,</b> despite the fact that immediately after the crash Smith was able to contact the dispatcher by radio. [...] Despite Smith's testimony, he apparently decided not to stop the train.|$|E

60|$|So Gudrun strolled {{the streets}} with Palmer, or went to the cinema with him. And his long, pale, rather elegant face flickered {{as he made his}} sarcastic remarks.

60|$|Very {{grateful}} was Dr. May to Tom {{for having}} learnt, {{and still more}} for having transmitted, all these details, and Ethel was not the less touched, because she knew they were to travel beyond Minster Street. Those words of Mr. Wilmot's <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> out their accomplishment; and she thought so the more, when in early spring one of Leonard's severe throat attacks led to his being sent after his recovery to assist the schoolmaster, instead of returning to the carpenter's shed; and he was found so valuable in the school that the master begged to retain his services.|$|E
6000|$|Meantime {{the spirit}} of enquiry and faith was making-marked progress. Mr. Codrington says: 'The stir in {{the hearts and minds}} of those already christened might be called a revival, and the enquiring and earnest spirit of many more <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> towards conversions. During this time, there might be seen on the cliff or under the trees in the afternoon, or on Sundays, little groups {{gathered}} round some of the elder Christians, enquiring and getting help. It was the work that George evidently was enabled to do in this way that convinced everyone that the time had quite come for his Ordination. It is worth mentioning that the boys from one island, and one individual in particular, were much influenced by the last conversations of the first Christian who died here (Walter Hotaswol), who had told his friends to be [...] "sure that all the Bishop had told them was true."' ...|$|E
60|$|To {{make them}} run easily and swiftly, the axles of {{carriages}} are anointed; and for {{much the same}} purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view {{is to make the}} boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft's bald keel. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> in obedience to some particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event.|$|E
