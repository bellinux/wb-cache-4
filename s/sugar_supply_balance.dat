We consider a two-steps game within a duopoly according to Kreps-Scheinkman framework with Cournot and Bertrand duopoly hypothesis.

40|$|Several grasses usually {{accumulate}} {{high levels}} of fructans at low temperature or {{in the presence of}} high <b>sugar</b> <b>supply.</b> Fructans enhance plant resistance in adverse environmental conditions thanks to their vacuolar localization which allow osmotic adjustments. Tall fescue calli do not show mature vacuoles due to its anatomic characteristics, and these in vitro cultures can provide more knowledge about the fructan rule in unspecialized tissues especially during stress conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the sugar metabolism in embryogenic calli of tall fescue fed with different sucrose concentrations (0, 50 or 100 mM) during growth culture, kept at “control” or “cold” temperatures (23 or 4 °C, respectively). In the presence of sucrose (50 or 100 mM), embryogenic calli accumulated fructans under control conditions.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} an {{analysis}} of the world sugar market, and specifically focuses on the supply and demand of refined sugar and their main determinants. The article first identifies the main determinants of the world supply of and demand for sugar, and further, their effect on such variables is quantified. Further, the component correlations on the selected market are analyzed. This consists of the identification of the factors affecting the production of refined sugar, as one of the main elements of the <b>supply</b> of <b>sugar,</b> as well as {{an analysis of}} the world price of sugar, as one of the significant factors affecting the world sugar market. The said correlations are quantified with the utilization of regression analysis on the basis of time series of the individual variables within the years 1980 – 2010. On the basis of the conducted analysis, the main determinants of the <b>sugar</b> <b>supply</b> on the world market within the analyzed period, for which an effect has been established both from an economic viewpoint, as well as from a statistical viewpoint, can be considered to be sugar reserves, its price and the acreage of sugarcane. The main determinant of the demand for sugar is, according to the conducted analysis, the global GDP on a new value level, as well as converted to one inhabitant. Further, the analysis also established the effect of the price of sugar and its reserves on the world production of refined sugar, and, last but not least, also the long-term tendency {{in the development of the}} world price of sugar. The analysis has proven significant influence of refined <b>sugar</b> <b>supply,</b> reserves of refined sugar, its price and area of sugar cane on <b>sugar</b> <b>supply.</b> Then, the analysis detected GDP as the main determinant of the sugar demand and the long memory in sugar prices.

40|$|Background: The {{development}} of the sterile insect technique (SIT) for reducing populations of Aedes albopictus (Skuse), (the vector of Chikungunya and Dengue fever), was studied in Reunion Island. For some mosquito species the sterilization process and mating activity may alter male survival. Most previous {{studies were carried out}} in the laboratory and may inadequately reflect the field situation. We conducted a semi-field experiment to evaluate the impact of <b>sugar</b> <b>supply</b> and mating activity under natural climatic conditions on wild and sterile male Ae. albopictus longevity, using large cages set up in an open clearing between trees and shrubs in Reunion Island. Results: Wild males had a mean longevity of 15. 5 days in the absence of females and with an immediate sugar supply; longevity in sterile males was similar. The presence of females greatly reduced both wild and especially sterile male lifespan; however, an immediate <b>sugar</b> <b>supply</b> could counteract this effect and allow sterile males to live an average of 11. 6 days. Conclusion: The outcomes indicate that sugar feeding could compensate for sterilization-induced damage, and that mating activity is not deleterious for well-fed males. This study stresses the critical importance of providing suitable sugar sources prior to release during SIT programmes. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
