40|$|This {{building}} {{is similar in}} design to the Economics and Management Sciences building and features elements of Post-Romanesque style, as reflected by its domed entrance and arches. The walls are a mixture of polystyrene and concrete to minimise echoes and improve acoustics, making it a popular conference and <b>seminar</b> <b>venue.</b> The complex was designed by architect Willie Oosthuizen of the firm VDO Architects. The official inauguration took place in March 1997 and was presided over by Prof S M E Bengu, the then Minister of Education.

40|$|Please {{join us for}} {{the coffee}} hour near the <b>seminar</b> <b>venue</b> a half hour before the seminar, 3 : 00 – 3 : 30 pm With the still growing demand for {{hydrocarbons}} worldwide and the proven economic and environmental advantages of natural gas over coal and oil, the demand for new LNG terminals has significantly increased in recent years. Safety and security aspects {{in view of the}} risk of possible terrorist attacks and relatively short lead time between conception and deployment is driving many decision makers to look after floating offshore LNG terminal solutions. Offshore LNG terminals are typically few miles away from the coast and offer relatively little threat to the people and marine environment, and easy access for incoming LNG carriers. When considering offshore LNG terminals, weather and marine environmental conditions are major factors greatly affecting the terminal design for optimal operational efficiency and reliability. Wind, waves and currents in many locations of interest can be severe. This complicates the terminal design and its operation, considering that the LNG carrying ships have to moor and offload to a moving floating structure {{in the middle of the}} sea. The maximization of the utilization of the facility for ensurin...|$|R
40|$|The {{seminar in}} Leipzig was the 10 th Seminar of The LIBER Architecture Group. During {{the years the}} Architecture Group has tried to {{organize}} the seminars in different ways, but every time with a strong focus on presentation of projects, library visits and to give room for the opportunity for the participants to exchange experiences between colleagues. Another main point is to bring librarians and architects together {{in order to create}} a better understanding between these two professions regarding library-building projects. The <b>seminar</b> <b>venue</b> in March 2002 was not in a library but the Leipzig Trade Fair (Leipziger Messe) in the outskirts of Leipzig and in connection with the annual Leipzig Book Fair. There were connections from town centre by tram. The first one and a half day (Tuesday and Wednesday) was concentrated on presentations of papers. Tuesday evening: Reception and visit of the university library Leipzig (reconstruction of a late 19 th century building). Thursday was reserved as a full day for a bus trip with library visits in Jena, Erfurt and Weimar. Friday was divided between a long morning with papers and the opportunity in the afternoon to visit the Leipzig Book Fair and the Deutsche Bücherei. Saturday morning there was another excursion to visit the new building of the state library in Dresden. In all about 100 participants took part in the conference. Some of the papers are printed in this issue of LIBER Quarterly...|$|R

It was originally built in 1427, and a minaret was added in 1921. The 300-seat theatre of the Alliance Franco-Comorienne serves as a venue for national and international performances, ceremonies, conferences, film screenings, and <b>seminars.</b> Other <b>venues</b> include the 700-seat Al-Kamar, the 500-seat Palais du Peuple, and the 300-seat Foyer des Jeunes de Foumbouni.|$|R

50|$|A {{native of}} Reykjavík, Kjartan Ólafsson spent from 1976 to 1989 {{studying}} music, composition and natural {{sciences at the}} Music College of Kópavogur, Hamrahliðar College, Reykjavík College of Music, Utrecht Conservatory and Sibelius Academy. In 1985, he received an award in the Icelandic Radio Competition for young composers and, in the near-quarter-century since, has been lecturing and holding <b>seminars</b> at such <b>venues</b> as the University of Iceland (1990), Reykjavík College of Music (1991-93), Sibelius Academy (1992), Finland's Avanti Summer Festival in Porvoo and Denmark's International Computer Music Conference in Aarhus (both 1994). In 2000, in connection with Reykjavík's status as the millennial and century year's European Culture City, he served as director of Icelandic Music in 100 Years, which became the largest festival of the country's music held up to that moment. In 2002, he traveled to the United States to lecture at New York University regarding use of CALMUS for algorithmic composing, a subject he updated with lectures at the 2008 Salzburg Mozarteum. Having taught music in the early 1990s at the Reykjavik College of Music, Kjartan has held, since 2005, the position of Professor of Composition and Theory at Iceland Academy of the Arts.|$|R
40|$|Welcome to Pisa and the 3 rd International Real-Time Scheduling Open Problems Seminar (RTSOPS 2012). This <b>seminar</b> {{provides}} a <b>venue</b> for {{the exchange of}} ideas and discussion of interesting unsolved problems in real-time scheduling. The format of the seminar positively encourages interaction between participants and {{provides a}}mple time for relaxed discussions. The goal of the seminar is to promote a spirit of cooperation and collaboration within the real-time scheduling community. This year, we have organized RTSOPS 2012 around joint presentation/collaboration sessions. At {{the beginning of each}} session, we will have 2 - 3 short presentations on a number of important problems in real-time scheduling that give a brief introduction to the problem and its challenges. At the end of each session, we invite the seminar participants (authors and audience members) to interact in small groups, exchanging ideas with the presenters on how the problems might be solved and taking the first steps towards a solution. A total of 11 open problems were selected for presentation at the seminar. These proceedings are also published as an INRIA research report available at hal. inria. fr.

40|$|Internet {{platforms}} such as Blackboard Collaborate, Desire 2 Learn, and Moodle have revolutionized how educators {{communicate by}} creating collaborative opportunities once limited {{only to the}} face-to-face settings (King, 2001; LaJoie, Garcia, Berdugo, Márquex, Espíndola, 2 ̆ 6 Nakamura, 2006). Using computer-mediated communication tools, teachers can now participate in quality, ongoing, collaborative, and situated learning. While an abundance of research exists pertaining to teacher professional development, {{little is known about}} the use of a web <b>seminar</b> as a <b>venue</b> for online professional development. Even less is known about teacher educators’ integration of a professional development web seminar as a component of the courses they teach. The purpose of this qualitative study, then, was to understand teacher educators’ use of an open access web seminar, Global Conversatiions in Literacy Research (GCLR), whose goal is to disseminate cutting-edge literacy research and improve literacy practices within their language and literacy teacher education courses. This qualitative study sought to answer the following: (a) Why do literacy teacher educators use online professional development web seminars within their courses? (b) How do literacy teacher educators use online professional development web seminars within their courses, especially those presented by Global Conversations in Literacy Research? and (c) What value do literacy teacher educators see in working with the web seminars in their classes, especially those presented by GCLR? This study was grounded in critical situated learning, which includes theories of critical literacy (Janks, 2000), situated learning (Brown, Collins, 2 ̆ 6 Duguid, 1989), collaborative learning (Borko, 2004; Brown et al., 1989; Lave 2 ̆ 6 Wenger, 1991), and legitimate peripheral participation (Brown et al., 1989). Within an interview study design, the constant comparative method (Glaser 2 ̆ 6 Strauss, 1967; Merriam, 2009) was used to analyze data collected from semi-structured interviews and documents, namely teacher educators’ course syllabi.
