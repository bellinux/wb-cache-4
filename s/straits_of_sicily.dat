6000|$|The reasons {{which prevent}} rocks from {{being used for}} {{ornament}} repress still more forcibly the portraiture of the sea. Yet the constant necessity of introducing some representation of water in order to explain the scene of events, or as a sacred symbol, has forced the sculptors of all ages to the invention of some type or letter for it, if not an actual imitation. We find every degree of conventionalism or of naturalism in these types, the earlier being, for the most part, thoughtful symbols; the latter, awkward attempts at portraiture.[65] The most conventional of all types is the Egyptian zigzag, preserved in the astronomical sign of Aquarius; but every nation, with any capacities of thought, has given, in some of its work, the same great definition of open water, as [...] "an undulatory thing with fish in it." [...] I say open water, because inland nations have a totally different conception of the element. Imagine for an instant the different feelings of an husbandman whose hut is built by the Rhine or the Po, and who sees, day by day, the same giddy succession of silent power, the same opaque, thick, whirling, irresistible labyrinth of rushing lines and twisted eddies, coiling themselves into serpentine race by the reedy banks, in omne volubilis ævum,--and {{the image of the}} sea {{in the mind of the}} fisher upon the rocks of Ithaca, or by the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sicily,</b> who sees how, day by day, the morning winds come coursing to the shore, every breath of them with a green wave rearing before it; clear, crisp, ringing, merry-minded waves, that fall over and over each other, laughing like children as they near the beach, and at last clash themselves all into dust of crystal over the dazzling sweeps of sand. Fancy the difference of the image of water in those two minds, and then compare the sculpture of the coiling eddies of the Tigris and its reedy branches in those slabs of Nineveh, with the crested curls of the Greek sea on the coins of Camerina or Tarentum. But both agree in the undulatory lines, either of the currents or the surface, and in the introduction of fish as explanatory of the meaning of those lines (so also the Egyptians in their frescoes, with most elaborate realisation of the fish). There is a very curious instance on a Greek mirror in the British Museum, representing Orion on the Sea; and multitudes of examples with dolphins on the Greek vases: the type is preserved without alteration in mediæval painting and sculpture. The sea in that Greek mirror (at least 400 B.C.), in the mosaics of Torcello and St. Mark's, on the font of St. Frediano at Lucca, on the gate of the fortress of St. Michael's Mount in Normandy, on the Bayeux tapestry, and on the capitals of the Ducal Palace at Venice (under Arion on his Dolphin), is represented in a manner absolutely identical. Giotto, in the frescoes of Avignon, has, with his usual strong feeling for naturalism, given the best example I remember, in painting, of the unity of the conventional system with direct imitation, and that both in sea and river; giving in pure blue color the coiling whirlpool of the stream, and the curled crest of the breaker. But in all early sculptural examples, both imitation and decorative effect are subordinate to easily understood symbolical language; the undulatory lines are often valuable as an enrichment of surface, but are rarely of any studied gracefulness. One of the best examples I know of their expressive arrangement is around some figures in a spandril at Bourges, representing figures sinking in deep sea (the deluge): the waved lines yield beneath the bodies and wildly lave the edge of the moulding, two birds, as if to mark the reverse of all order of nature, lowest of all sunk in the depth of them. In later times of debasement, water began to be represented with its waves, foam, etc., as on the Vendramin tomb at Venice, above cited; but even there, without any definite ornamental purpose, the sculptor meant partly to explain a story, partly to display dexterity of chiselling, but not to produce beautiful forms pleasant to the eye. The imitation is vapid and joyless, and it has often been matter of surprise to me that sculptors, so fond of exhibiting their skill, should have suffered this imitation to fall so short, and remain so cold,--should not have taken more pains to curl the waves clearly, to edge them sharply, and to express, by drill-holes or other artifices, the character of foam. I think in one of the Antwerp churches something of this kind is done in wood, but in general it is rare.|$|E

The Italians started to close in to the aircraft of Nos. 1, 92, 417, and 601 SAAF Squadrons, which were flying at low level, but were surprised by six Polish pilots of 145 Squadron flying high cover. These were joined by other Spitfires, and the 33 Macchis found themselves in combat with up to 60 Spitfires (mainly Mk VCs, and possibly Mk VIIIs and IXs). The Italian pilots claimed 15 victories (one by Maresciallo Baschirotto, who fired 500 rounds), with 14 Spitfires downed in the sea and another over African soil. The Polish pilots, on the other hand claimed seven victories, another three were claimed by 92 Squadron and one by a pilot of 601.The encounter was differently described by other sources:On 20 April 1943, over the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sicily,</b> 30 C. 202 and C. 205Vs from 1° Stormo clashed with 60 Spitfires.

We present a detailed nutrient budget of inputs to the basin, which shows {{that there is a}} high N: P ratio (> 16 : 1) in all the input sources, particularly from the atmospheric source, where the N: P ratio was 117 : 1. The high N: P ratio is retained within the system because there is no significant denitrification in either the sediments or intermediate water. This is because of the extreme oligotrophic nature of the system, which is caused by the unusual anti-estuarine flow at the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sicily.</b> Support for this conclusion is provided by the observation that the only area of the eastern Mediterranean where the N: P ratio in deeper water is 16 : 1 is the northern Adriatic, which is also the only area with significant denitrification. The N budget (total input to basin vs. net output at the <b>straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sicily)</b> balances closely. This N balance suggests that N fixation is an insignificant process in this P-limited system. The unusually light 15 N values in the deep water nitrate and particulate organic nitrogen can be explained by processes other than nitrogen fixation. These processes include a lack of significant denitrification in the basin and by particulate organic matter exported from surface waters during the Plimited winter plankton bloom. ...|$|E

40|$|Although silica {{is a key}} plant nutrient, {{there have}} been few studies aimed at {{understanding}} the Si cycle in the eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS). Here we use a combination of new measurements and literature values to explain the silicic acid distribution across the basin and to calculate a silica budget to identify the key controlling processes. The surface water concentration of ∼ 1 μM, which is unchanging seasonally across the basin, was due to the inflow of western Mediterranean Sea (WMS) water at the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sicily.</b> It does not change seasonally because there is only a sparse population of diatoms due to the low nutrient (N and P) supply to the photic zone in the EMS. The concentration of silicic acid in the deep water of the western Ionian Sea (6. 3 μM) close to the S Adriatic are an of formation was due to the preformed silicic acid (3 μM) plus biogenic silica (BSi) from the dissolution of diatoms from the winter phytoplankton bloom (3. 2 μM). The increase of 4. 4 μM across the deep water of the EMS was due to silicic acid formed from in situ diagenetic weathering of aluminosilicate minerals fluxing out of the sediment. The major inputs to the EMS are silicic acid and BSi inflowing from the western Mediterranean (121 × 10 9 mol Si yr − 1 silicic acid and 16 × 10 9 mol Si yr − 1 BSi), silicic acid fluxing from the sediment (54 × 10 9 mol Si yr − 1) and riverine (27 × 10 9 mol Si yr − 1) and subterranean groundwater (9. 7 × 10 9 mol Si yr − 1) inputs, with only a minor direct input from dissolution of dust in the water column (1 × 10 9 mol Si yr − 1). This budget shows the importance of rapidly dissolving BSi and in situ weathering of aluminosilicate minerals as sources of silica to balance the net export of silicic acid at the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sicily.</b> Future measurements to improve the accuracy of this preliminary budget have been identified...|$|E

In 2004 the region was revisited with oceanographic equipment including a multibeam sonar, an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP), CTD’s, temperature loggers, a methane sensor, and a video camera. The visual observations at one site show carbonate mounds comprised of large heterogeneous blocks that suggest the presence of mud volcanism. A multibeam sonar survey of the area shows that the carbonate mounds are of order 5 – 10 m in height and 10 – 100 m in lateral dimension, and that they form in clusters. The multibeam backscatter data show high amplitudes in the region surrounding the carbonate mounds, possibly indicating the surficial extent of thecarbonate material.

Their characteristics are of considerable interest to the geology, geophysics, geochemistry, and underwater acoustics communities.

Close-range (single-interaction) scattering measurements from a mud volcano in the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sicily</b> show scattering 10 – 15 dB above the background. Three hypotheses were examined concerning the scattering mechanism: (1) gas entrained in sediment at/near mud volcano, (2) gas bubbles and/or particulates (emitted) in the water column, (3) the carbonate bio-construction covering the mud volcano edifice. The experimental evidence, including visual, acoustic, and nonacoustic sensors, rules out the second hypothesis (at least during the observation time) and suggests that, for this particular mud volcano the dominant mechanism is associated with carbonate chimneys on the mud volcano. In terms of scattering levels, target strengths of 4 – 14 dB were observed from 800 to 3600 Hz for a monostatic geometry with grazing angles of 3 – 5 °.

The upper limit of bioavailable P ranged from 6 to 18 nM, suggesting severe P shortage. Orthophosphate turnover time ranged from 2 to 7 h in those P,-depleted waters. In nutrient-enrichment bioassays using subsurface water from the Ionian and Levantine basins, P addition caused significant increases in bacterial activity, bacterial numbers, and chlorophyll a relative to unenriched controls. The addition of NH, ’ + Fe + EDTA did not have these effects. In a similar bioassay using Cretan water, microbial growth was obtained even in the unemriched controls, suggesting that other factors (e. g. grazing, light) were influential.

40|$|Diatoms {{were studied}} quantitatively in six latest Quaternary (~ 70 kyr B.

The Atlantic cores completely lack diatoms. In the Alboran Basin, diatoms are common from late Stage 3 (~ 27. 5 kyr B. P.) to Termination lb (9 kyr B. P.) and in Recent core tops, but are absent in the other latest Quaternary intervals. Maximum accumulation of diatoms and highest abundance of species normally in sediments associated with increased productivity occurred during the latest Quaternary deglaciation, in the first phase of Termination I (~ 14. 8 kyr B. P.). In the modern Alboran Basin, a region of high biological productivity occurs immediately east of the Gibraltar Straits. This high productivity results from upwelling associated with the interaction between the Atlantic inflow and the bottom topography near the Spanish coast. The upwelled nutrient-rich waters are then advected to the east and southeast by the surficial anticyclonic gyral circulation. Late Quaternary variations in diatom abundance are considered to reflect changes in this upwelling intensity with highest diatom abundances inferred to result from increased upwelling associated with an intensification of the anticyclonic gyral circulation. Highest inferred upwelling rates occurred during the first phase of latest Quaternary deglaciation.

Critical zones for their role in the ecology of the main demersal fishery target species were investigated using species abundance data disaggregated by life stage. Spatial analysis and the application of GIS techniques allowed the identification of preferred habitats (e. g. nursery, feeding and spawning areas) for Merluccius merluccius, Mullus barbatus, Parapenaeus longirostris, Raja clavata and Raja miraletus. The impact of fishing on these species was assessed, particularly in terms of fish assemblages. The transport paths of early life stages were also hypothesized on the basis of oceanographic factors typical of the area. The results revealed that the spatial distribution of the main fishery resources overlaps the limits of the current GSAs. The analysis of oceanographic factors showed that some fishery resources are sustained by young individuals transported from adjacent GSAs. The results also demonstrated that the spatial distribution of the main demersal fishery resources in the Mediterranean GSA 15 straddle other GSAs, in particular as concerns nursery and spawning areas, indicating that some fishery resources are shared. This implies that harmonized fishery management should be applied over a larger area than is implied by the GSA concept.

40|$|Phylogeographic studies {{give us the}} {{opportunity}} to reconstruct the historical migrations of species and link them with climatic and geographic variation. They are, therefore, a key tool to understanding the relationships among biology, geology and history. One of the most interesting biogeographical areas of the world is the Mediterranean region. However, in this area, the description of concordant phylogeographic patterns is quite scarce, which limits the understanding of evolutionary patterns related to climate. Species with one-dimensional distribution ranges, such as the strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), are particularly useful to unravel these patterns. Here, we describe its phylogeographic structure and check for concordance with patterns seen in other Mediterranean plants: longitudinal/latitudinal clines of diversity, evidence for glacial refugia and the role of sea straits in dispersal. We also identify the most likely source for the disjunct Irish population. With this aim, we sequenced four chloroplast non-coding fragments of A. unedo from 23 populations covering its whole distribution. We determined the genetic diversity, population structure, haplotype genealogy and time to the most recent common ancestor. The genealogy revealed two clades that separated during the last 700 ky but before the last glacial maximum. One clade occupies Atlantic Iberia and North Africa, while the other occurs in the Western Mediterranean. The Eastern Mediterranean is inhabited by newer haplotypes derived from both clades, while the Irish population is closely related to Iberian demes. The <b>straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sicily</b> and Gibraltar partially restricted the gene flow. We concluded that a vicariance event during the Late Quaternary in the western end of the species' range followed by eastward migration seems a likely explanation for the observed phylogeographic pattern. The role of straits indicates an occasional communication between Europe and North Africa, suggesting that the latter was a novel refugia. The East–West genetic split in Iberia is consistent with the refugia-within-refugia model.
