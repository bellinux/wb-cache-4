For example, the Phillips catalyst, prepared from chromium oxides, {{is used for the}} production of about half the world's polyethylene.

5|$|Two related {{processes}} for the carbonylation of methanol: the rhodium-catalyzed Monsanto process, and the iridium-catalyzed Cativa process. The latter process is greener {{and more efficient}} and has largely supplanted the former process, often in the same production plants. Catalytic amounts of water are used in both processes, but the Cativa process requires less, so the water-gas <b>shift</b> <b>reaction</b> is suppressed, and fewer by-products are formed.|$|E

50|$|With {{regard to}} {{synthetic}} fuels, an old but still important {{process is the}} Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons from synthesis gas, which itself is processed via water-gas <b>shift</b> <b>reactions,</b> catalysed by iron. Biodiesel and related biofuels require processing via both inorganic and biocatalysts.|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} synthesis-gas {{compositions}} can be used. For cobalt-based catalysts the optimal H2:CO ratio is around 1.8–2.1. Iron-based catalysts can tolerate lower ratios, due to intrinsic Water Gas <b>Shift</b> <b>Reaction</b> {{activity of the}} Iron catalyst. This reactivity can be important for synthesis gas derived from coal or biomass, which tend to have relatively low H2:CO ratios (<nbsp&1).|$|E
25|$|Fischer–Tropsch plants {{associated}} with coal or related solid feedstocks (sources of carbon) must first convert the solid fuel into gaseous reactants, i.e., CO, H2, and alkanes. This conversion is called gasification {{and the product}} is called synthesis gas ("syngas"). Synthesis gas obtained from coal gasification tends to have a H2:CO ratio of ~0.7 compared to the ideal ratio of ~2. This ratio is adjusted via the water-gas <b>shift</b> <b>reaction.</b> Coal-based Fischer–Tropsch plants produce varying amounts of CO2, depending upon the energy source of the gasification process. However, most coal-based plants rely on the feed coal to supply all the energy requirements of the Fischer–Tropsch process.|$|E
25|$|Cobalt-based {{catalysts}} {{are highly}} active, although iron {{may be more}} suitable for certain applications. Cobalt catalysts are more active for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis when the feedstock is natural gas. Natural gas has a high hydrogen to carbon ratio, so the water-gas-shift is not needed for cobalt catalysts. Iron catalysts are preferred for lower quality feedstocks such as coal or biomass. Synthesis gases derived from these hydrogen-poor feedstocks has a low-hydrogen-content and require the water–gas <b>shift</b> <b>reaction.</b> Unlike the other metals used for this process (Co, Ni, Ru), which remain in the metallic state during synthesis, iron catalysts tend to form a number of phases, including various oxides and carbides during the reaction. Control of these phase transformations can be important in maintaining catalytic activity and preventing breakdown of the catalyst particles.|$|E
25|$|In a {{rearrangement}} reaction, {{the carbon}} {{skeleton of a}} molecule is rearranged to give a structural isomer of the original molecule.

40|$|Based {{on a small}} test system, (R) -CH(OH) (OO center dot) CH 2 CHO, we have {{developed}} a cost-effective approach to the practical implementation of multiconformer transition state theory for peroxy radical hydrogen <b>shift</b> <b>reactions</b> at atmospherically relevant temperatures. While conformer searching is crucial for accurate reaction rates, an energy cutoff {{can be used to}} significantly reduce the computational cost with little loss of accuracy. For the reaction barrier, high-level calculations are needed, but the highest level of electronic structure theory is not necessary for the relative energy between conformers. Improving the approach to both transition state theory and electronic structure theory decreases the calculated reaction rate significantly, so low-level calculations can be used to rule out slow reactions. Further computational time can be saved by approximating the tunneling coefficients for each transition state by only that of the lowest-energy transition state. Finally, we test and validate our approach using higher-level theoretical values for our test system and existing experimental results for additional peroxy radical hydrogen <b>shift</b> <b>reactions</b> in three slightly larger systems...|$|R

25|$|There are {{synthetic}} pathways {{for using}} electricity to reduce {{carbon dioxide and}} water to liquid hydrocarbon or alcohol fuels.

Converting electrical energy to carbon-based liquid fuel has potential to provide portable energy storage usable by the large existing stock of motor vehicles and other engine-driven equipment, without the difficulties of dealing with hydrogen or another exotic energy carrier.

40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} studies of steam}methane reforming {{in the presence}} of a hydrotalcite-based CO 2 adsorbent are presented. Attention is given to the analysis of the transient behaviour of a tubular (integral) reactor when an Ni-based catalyst is admixed with the adsorbent. Considerable enhancement of the methane conversion is experimentally demonstrated. Enhancement arises from the favourable <b>shifts</b> in the <b>reaction</b> equilibria of the reforming and water}gas <b>shift</b> <b>reactions</b> towards further CO 2 production.
