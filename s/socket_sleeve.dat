5000|$|Swaging is {{a method}} of wire rope {{termination}} that refers to the installation technique. The purpose of swaging wire rope fittings is to connect two wire rope ends together, or to otherwise terminate one end of wire rope to something else. A mechanical or hydraulic swager is used to compress and deform the fitting, creating a permanent connection. There are many types of swaged fittings. Threaded Studs, Ferrules, <b>Sockets,</b> and <b>Sleeves</b> are a few examples. [...] Swaging ropes with fibre cores is not recommended.|$|R
25|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of users accidentally {{touching}} energized conductors and thereby experiencing electric shock, plug and socket systems often incorporate safety features in addition to the recessed contacts of the energized socket. These include plugs with insulated <b>sleeves,</b> <b>sockets</b> with blocking shutters, and sockets designed to accept only compatible plugs inserted in the correct orientation.|$|R
5000|$|Össur {{manufactures}} prosthetic {{limbs and}} joints, liners, <b>sockets,</b> locks and <b>sleeves.</b> Its products include Flex-Foot, a prosthetic foot made from carbon fiber, a material {{used in the}} aerospace industry for its strength and flexibility. The Flex-Foot Cheetah developed by medical engineer Van Phillips and worn by Alan Oliveira and other amputee athletes is a derivative of this product line. Össur also produces the Total Knee prosthetic, which possesses a [...] "locking moment" [...] which keeps the knee from collapsing when it is in full extension, Mauch Knee, which has a hydraulic system for fluid and natural gait, and Iceross silicone prosthetic liners, which provide an interface between the skin and the socket.|$|R
40|$|The silicon liner socket {{has been}} used in the trans-tibial {{prosthesis}} since the 1980 s. Silicon liner <b>sockets</b> are <b>sleeves</b> of silicon material that are rolled onto the stump and fix the prosthesis to it. The producers of the liners propagate many advantages in their use i. e. better suspension of the prosthesis, protection of the stump skin and improved cosmetic appearance. This review was performed to find objective documentation in the literature in support of the advantages in prosthetic fitting and use of silicon liners. A medline search was performed with the key words: "silicon liner socket, Icelandic Roll On Silicon Socket (ICEROSS), trans-tibial prosthesis, lower leg prosthesis and stump sockets". Six articles remained after application of the selection criteria. In two studies clinical examination was done while in the rest questionnaires were used to collect data. The indication for amputation varied from vascular insufficiency, diabetes mellitus and infection to trauma. Most studies mentioned improved prosthetic suspension compared to the conventional supracondylar fitting. Also the walking performance improved with less use of walking aids. There were reports of positive but also negative effects on the skin such as excessive perspiration and itching. Patients had a general preference in prosthetic appearance in favour of the prosthesis with a silicon liner. Further research is needed with the use of objective clinical parameters and a homogenous study group objectively to find advantages {{in the use of the}} silicon liner socket in the trans-tibial prosthesis...|$|R
40|$|Silicone socket {{suspension}} {{technology for}} the upper extremity amputee has been proven to provide increased suspension and range of motion over conventional self suspending sockets. Application of silicone socket suspension has greatly benefitted clients with very short residual limbs and disarticulation level amputations. However, the use of silicone suspension sockets with myoelectric control has presented some problems, namely relating to {{the wear and tear}} on electrical control cables and connections. Managing the interface between silicone socket and hard socket without compromise to signal loss via an electrical-mechanical interface about the pin lock has been investigated, and although function was acceptable, this approach was technically complex. An alternate and potentially simple solution is the use of an electrically conductive silicone interface within the silicone socket and localized at the electrode site. To investigate the feasibility of this approach, a prosthetic <b>socket</b> and silicon <b>sleeve</b> using the conductive material was fabricated and evaluated on a single subject. Signal quality was found to be acceptable but further work is needed to assess the factors that can be targeted to further improve the signal-to-noise ratio. This approach has the potential to reduce the technical requirements in achieving usable EMG signal capture...|$|R
