500|$|The {{earliest}} {{model of}} the transmission line was probably described by Georg Ohm (1827) who established that resistance in a wire is proportional to its length.*John C. Shedd, Mayo D. Hershey, [...] "The history of Ohm's law", The Popular Science Monthly, pp.599-614, December 1913 ISSN 0161-7370. The Ohm model thus included only resistance. Latimer Clark noted that signals were delayed and elongated along a cable, an undesirable form of distortion now called dispersion but then called retardation, and Michael Faraday (1853) established that {{this was due to}} the capacitance present in the transmission line. Lord Kelvin (1854) found the correct mathematical description needed in his work on early transatlantic cables; he arrived at an equation identical to the conduction of a heat pulse along a metal bar. This model incorporates only resistance and capacitance, but that is all that was needed in undersea cables dominated by capacitance effects. Kelvin's model predicts a limit on the telegraph signalling speed of a cable but Kelvin still did not use the concept of bandwidth, the limit was entirely explained in terms of the dispersion of the telegraph symbols. The mathematical {{model of the}} transmission line reached its fullest development with Oliver Heaviside. Heaviside (1881) introduced <b>series</b> <b>inductance</b> and shunt conductance into the model making four distributed elements in all. This model is now known as the telegrapher's equation and the distributed elements are called the primary line constants.Heaviside, O, Electrical Papers, vol 1, pp.139-140, Boston, 1925 ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{analytical methods}} {{to calculate the}} equivalent circuit parameters for large-scale brushless doubly fed machines (BDFMs) with magnetic wedges utilized for closing stator open slots. The use of magnetic wedges reduces the magnetizing currents in the machine, reflected in the values of magnetizing inductances, but also increases leakage fluxes affecting the value of <b>series</b> <b>inductances</b> in the equivalent circuit. Though such effects can be modeled by numerical models, the proposed analytical methods are particularly helpful in optimizing machine design, inverter rating, reactive power management, and grid low-voltage ride-through performance. The conventional analytical methods cannot be readily applied to the BDFM due to its complex magnetic field distribution; this paper presents analytical methods to calculate the magnetizing and leakage inductances for the BDFM with magnetic wedges used in the stator slots.

40|$|Abstract:- Simultaneous {{switching}} noise (SSN) is a {{major cause}} of power integrity (PI) degradation that causes circuits to become unstable and experience errors. As modern ICs operate at higher speeds with higher density and lower voltages, SSN has become a serious issue that must be addressed to ensure system stability during the short rise- and fall-times of the logic transient states. Most traditional designs have generally used decoupling capacitors to reduce SSN. As these capacitors become equivalent <b>series</b> <b>inductances</b> when the system operates at high frequencies, such a technique works against reducing SSN. Therefore, we propose a methodology that effectively alleviates the problem of SSN using an evaluation based on the enhanced I/O buffer information specification (IBIS) model with decoupling capacitors and a high-frequency low-impendence circuit. We showed that our new method reduces noise by more than 73. 2 %, 58. 3 %, 25. 7 %, and 59. 8 % compared to IBIS, traditional decoupling capacitors, IBIS with a high-frequency low-impendence circuit, and HP Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (HSPICE) methodologies, respectively...|$|R

The equivalent electrical circuit {{is based on the}} lumped parameter model. Transformer elements include series capacitance, ground capacitance and inductance. The calculation were based on 6. 6 kV transformer design specification data sheet. The values of the parameters were changed in order to simulate a likelihood of failure on the windings, which would correspond to unique frequency range spectrum. The FRA simulation range is from 10 kHz to 2 MHz. Then sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the accuracies of the two types of measurand: transfer function (Vout/Vin) and trans impedance (Vin/Iout).
