2500|$|AMM is a British free {{improvisation}} {{group that}} was founded in London, England, in 1965. The group was initially composed of Keith Rowe on guitar, Lou Gare on saxophone and Eddie Prévost on drums. The three men shared a common interest in exploring music {{beyond the boundaries of}} conventional jazz, {{as part of a larger}} movement that helped spawn European free jazz and free improvisation. AMM have never been well known to the general public, but have been influential on the field of improvised music. Most of their recordings have been released on Matchless Recordings, which was run by founding member and percussionist Eddie Prévost.

2500|$|The {{history of}} Jewish {{religious}} practice has included cult images and figurines made of ivory, terracotta, faience and seals. As more material evidence emerged, one proposal {{has been that}} Judaism oscillated between idolatry and iconoclasm. However, the dating of the objects and texts suggest that the two theologies and liturgical practices existed simultaneously. The claimed rejection of idolatry because of monotheism found in Jewish literature and therefrom in biblical Christian literature, states Janowitz, has been unreal abstraction and flawed construction of the actual history. The material evidence of images, statues and figurines taken together with the textual description of cherub and [...] "wine standing for blood", for example, suggests that symbolism, making religious images, icon and index has been integral part of Judaism. Every religion has some objects that represent the divine and <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> {{in the mind of}} the faithful, and Judaism too has had its holy objects and symbols such as the Menorah.|$|E

2500|$|Many of the {{characters}} in An Island are parodies of Blake's friends and acquaintances, although there is considerable critical disagreement as to whom some characters represent. Indeed, some scholars question the usefulness of trying to discover whom any of them represent. Northrop Frye, for example, argues [...] "{{the characters}} are not so much individuals as representatives of the various types of [...] "reasoning" [...] which are satirised." [...] Peter Ackroyd also suggests that understanding whom the characters represent is less important than understanding the satire {{at the heart of the}} piece. Similarly, Nick Rawlinson argues that trying to attach the characters to specific people [...] "limits the scope of the work to the eighteenth-century equivalent of a scurrilous email [...] it is reasonable to assume that the various characters <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> more than just amusing personality sketches [...] It may be more helpful to see the characters as a reflection not just of a real person but also of an attitude Blake wishes to question." ...|$|E

60|$|Now let us {{consider}} {{what would be the}} necessary consequences of the establishment of Proportional Representation in such a community as Great Britain--that is to say, the redistribution of the country into great constituencies such as London or Ulster or Wessex or South Wales, each returning a score or more of members, and the establishment of voting by the single transferable vote. The first, immediate, most desirable result would be the disappearance of the undistinguished party candidate; he would vanish altogether. He would be no more seen. Proportional Representation would not give him the ghost of a chance. The very young man of good family, the subsidised barrister, the respectable nobody, the rich supporter of the party would be ousted by known men. No candidate who had not already distinguished himself, and who did not <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> in the public eye, would have a chance of election. There alone we have a sufficient reason for anticipating a very thorough change in the quality and character of the average legislator.|$|E

5000|$|... "A sign, or representamen, is {{something}} which <b>stands</b> to somebody <b>for</b> <b>something</b> in some respect or capacity.

[...] Peirce called the sign a representamen, in order to bring out the fact that a sign {{is something}} that [...] "represents" [...] something else in order to suggest it (that is, [...] "re-present" [...] it) in some way.

60|$|There are {{truths that}} have almost become untrue by {{becoming}} untruthful.

This point about curiosity is not the conventional complaint against the American interviewer. It is not the ordinary joke against the American child. And {{in the same way}} I feel the danger of it being identified with the cant about 'a young nation' if I say that it has some of the attractions, not of American childhood, but of real childhood. There is some truth in the tradition that the children of wealthy Americans tend to be too precocious and luxurious. But there is a sense in which we can really say that if the children are like adults, the adults are like children. And that sense is in the very best sense of childhood. It is something which the modern world does not understand. It is something that modern Americans do not understand, even when they possess it; but I think they do possess it.|$|E
60|$|This {{disparagement}} {{will not}} come from the leaders, but from inferior persons. The robust gentlemen who stand {{at the head of the}} practical class, share the ideas of the time, and have too much sympathy with the speculative class. It is not from men excellent in any kind, that disparagement of any other is to be looked for. With such, Talleyrand's question is ever the main one; not, is he rich? is he committed? is he well-meaning? has he this or that faculty? is he of the movement? is he of the establishment?--but, Is he anybody? does he <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>something?</b> He must be good of his kind. That is all that Talleyrand, all that State-street, all that the common sense of mankind asks. Be real and admirable, not as we know, but as you know. Able men do not care in what kind a man is able, so only that he is able. A master likes a master, and does not stipulate whether it be orator, artist, craftsman, or king.|$|E
60|$|It is true {{the names}} of {{substances}} {{would be much more}} useful, and propositions made in them much more certain, were the real essences of substances the ideas in our minds which those words signified. And it is for want of those real essences that our words convey so little knowledge or certainty in our discourses about them; and therefore the mind, to remove that imperfection as much as it can, makes them, by a secret supposition, to stand for a thing having that real essence, as if thereby it made some nearer approaches to it. For, though the word MAN or GOLD signify nothing truly but a complex idea of properties united together in one sort of substances; yet there is scarce anybody, in the use of these words, but often supposes each of those names to stand for a thing having the real essence on which these properties depend. Which is so far from diminishing the imperfection of our words, that by a plain abuse it adds to it, when we would make them <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>something,</b> which, not being in our complex idea, the name we use can no ways be the sign of.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Bright did {{not agree}} with him, but rather favoured the {{principle}} of inviolability. In November Mr. Gladstone prepared a still more elaborate memorandum in support of a protest from the neutral Powers. The Duke of Argyll put what was perhaps the general view when he wrote to Mr. Gladstone (Nov. 25, 1870), “that he had himself never argued in favour of the German annexation of Alsace and Lorraine, but only against our having any right to oppose it otherwise than by the most friendly dissuasion.” The Duke held that the consent of populations to live under a particular government is a right subject to a great many qualifications, and it would not be easy to turn such a doctrine into the base of an official remonstrance. After all, he said, the instincts of nations <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> in this world. The German did not exceed the ancient acknowledged right of nations in successful wars, when he said to Alsace and Lorraine, “Conquest in a war forced upon me by the people of which you form a part, gives me the right to annex, if on other grounds I deem it expedient, and for strategic reasons I do so deem it.” ...|$|E

60|$|The flames were {{gathering}} thick at present, for Stransom had entered that dark defile of our earthly descent {{in which some}} one dies every day. It was only yesterday that Kate Creston had flashed out her white fire; yet already there were younger stars ablaze on {{the tips of the}} tapers. Various persons in whom his interest had not been intense drew closer to him by entering this company. He went over it, head by head, till he felt like the shepherd of a huddled flock, with all a shepherd’s vision of differences imperceptible. He knew his candles apart, up to the colour of the flame, and would still have known them had their positions all been changed. To other imaginations they might stand for other things—that they should <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> to be hushed before was all he desired; but he was intensely conscious of the personal note of each and of the distinguishable way it contributed to the concert. There were hours at which he almost caught himself wishing that certain of his friends would now die, that he might establish with them in this manner a connexion more charming than, as it happened, it was possible to enjoy with them in life. In regard to those from whom one was separated by the long curves of the globe such a connexion could only be an improvement: it brought them instantly within reach. Of course there were gaps in the constellation, for Stransom knew he could only pretend to act for his own, and it wasn’t every figure passing before his eyes into the great obscure that was entitled to a memorial. There was a strange sanctification in death, but some characters were more sanctified by being forgotten than by being remembered. The greatest blank in the shining page was the memory of Acton Hague, of which he inveterately tried to rid himself. For Acton Hague no flame could ever rise on any altar of his.|$|E
