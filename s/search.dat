5|$|A binary <b>search</b> tree is {{a binary}} tree data {{structure}} that works {{based on the}} principle of binary <b>search.</b> The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary <b>search,</b> taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in binary <b>search</b> trees. This can faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.|$|E

5|$|An {{infinite}} loop may occur if the exit {{conditions for the}} loop are not defined correctly. Once L exceeds R, the <b>search</b> has failed and must convey {{the failure of the}} <b>search.</b> In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, {{or in the case of}} an implementation where this check is moved to the end, checks for whether the <b>search</b> was successful or failed at the end must be in place.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} avoid blind <b>searching</b> before {{reducing}} the <b>searching</b> space of optimized variable and enhance <b>searching</b> efficiency in chaos optimization algorithm, a new mutative scale chaos optimization algorithm, Probability Chaos Optimization Algorithm (PCOA) was proposed. The current <b>searching</b> space is <b>searched</b> according to large probability and the origin space is <b>searched</b> according to small probability. Though the <b>searching</b> space is shrunk prematurely, the global optimal point can be found because the origin space is still <b>searched</b> according to small probability, which can overcome the shortcoming of losing the global optimal points owing to prematurely shrinking the <b>searching</b> space of the optimized variables in conventional mutative scale chaos optimization algorithm.

5|$|Because {{the planet}} is {{predicted}} to be visible in the Northern Hemisphere, the primary <b>search</b> {{is expected to be}} carried out using the Subaru Telescope, which has both an aperture large enough to see faint objects and a wide field of view to shorten the <b>search.</b> Two teams of astronomers—Batygin and Brown, as well as Trujillo and Sheppard—are undertaking this <b>search</b> together, and both teams cooperatively expect the <b>search</b> to take up to five years. Brown and Batygin initially narrowed the <b>search</b> for Planet Nine down to roughly 2,000 square degrees of sky near Orion, a swath of space, that in Batygin's opinion, could be covered in about 20 nights by the Subaru Telescope. Subsequent refinements by Batygin and Brown have reduced the <b>search</b> space to 600–800 square degrees of sky.|$|E
5|$|Binary <b>search</b> {{works on}} sorted arrays. Binary <b>search</b> begins by {{comparing}} the middle element of the array with the target value.

Other factors are the storage space required, the efficiency of updating, etc. As a consequence, in many cases auxiliary data structures are created and maintained in order to speed up the task of <b>searching.</b> These auxiliary data structures store data, which are derived from the original data set and are exploited by the <b>searching</b> algorithm in order to speed up <b>searching...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1946, John Mauchly {{made the}} first mention of binary <b>search</b> {{as part of the}} Moore School Lectures, the first ever set of lectures {{regarding}} any computer-related topic. Every published binary <b>search</b> algorithm worked only for arrays whose length is one less than a power of two until 1960, when Derrick Henry Lehmer published a binary <b>search</b> algorithm that worked on all arrays. In 1962, Hermann Bottenbruch presented an ALGOL 60 implementation of binary <b>search</b> that placed the comparison for equality at the end, increasing the average number of iterations by one, but reducing to one the number of comparisons per iteration. The uniform binary <b>search</b> was presented to Donald Knuth in 1971 by A. K. Chandra of Stanford University and published in Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming. In 1986, Bernard Chazelle and Leonidas J. Guibas introduced fractional cascading as a method to solve numerous <b>search</b> problems in computational geometry.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no <b>search</b> {{algorithm}} that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst case performance than binary <b>search.</b> This {{is because the}} comparison tree representing binary <b>search</b> has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes if there are enough. Otherwise, the <b>search</b> algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, {{increasing the number of}} iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other <b>search</b> algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is affected. This problem is solved by binary <b>search,</b> as dividing the array in half ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E
