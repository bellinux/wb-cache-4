The objective was to obtain a uniform {{flow in the}} test section of the wind tunnel while keeping the pressure losses over the tunnel as low as possible.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the scale model studies {{of a complex}} under pressure settling structure, carried out at the Laboratory of Hydraulic Constructions of the University of Liège. Made up of fourteen identical <b>settling</b> <b>chambers</b> placed side by side and the bottom of which is divided into pyramidal hoppers, the structure, totally under pressure, is fed by a vertical shaft. Downstream, the <b>settling</b> <b>chambers</b> discharge into a collector, which ensures the clean water feeding of four penstocks through a free surface basin. Finally, a pipes network, under the chambers, ensures the downstream evacuation of the sand trapped in the hoppers. Using adapted and theoretically justified similarity laws coupled with realistic scales for the models, the hydrodynamic behavior and solid transport phenomena in this complex system have been studied. Special care has been taken to evaluate the trap efficiency, the evacuation system working and the global discharge repartition between the fourteen chambers.

40|$|In {{the design}} of control system of a wind tunnel, it is {{important}} to understand the importance of operations of mechanical systems in order to ensure that any emergencies that may arise during the running of the wind tunnel are properly handled by the system. In the NAL 0. 6 m blowdown wind tunnel, it is proposed to incorporate a Variable Mach number Flexible Nozzle (VMFN), using which the tunnel 13; can be started at a low Mach number and the required test Mach number (up to 4) can be reached by continuously (on-line) changing the nozzle contour using an Electroservohydraulic drive. Before stopping the tunnel, the VMFN would be reverted to the initial low Mach number condition. During the entire operation of the tunnel in such a scenario, it is essential that the Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV) maintains the specified or minimum stagnation pressure in the test section by following a safe trajectory. In order to determine a safe trajectory, a basic understanding of the variation of stagnation pressure in the <b>settling</b> <b>chamber</b> is called for, before the PRV control system is designed. In this paper, the problem is 13; formulated based on quasi-steady isentropic equations and programmed in C language to predict the timehistories 13; of <b>settling</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure and storage tank pressure for a given trajectory of the opening of PRV, as the VMFN throat is changed from Mach 1 to Mach 4 condition and vice versa. In order to validate the present methodology, the PRV trajectory measured during an experiment in the NAL 0. 6 m 13; wind tunnel was used as input to the program and the measured time-histories of <b>settling</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure and storage tank pressure are compared with the predicted values. Predictions of <b>settling</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure and the storage tank pressure relevant to VMFN operation indicate that <b>settling</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure rapidly builds up towards the storage tank pressure, apparently due to the constriction offered at the VMFN throat as VMFN throat is changed from M= 1 contour to M= 4 contour during the 13; start of the run. Minimum PRV opening area has been predicted to maintain the <b>settling</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure 13; higher than the estimated minimum value at high Mach numbers. For smaller openings of the PRV (lt; 0. 065 m 2), the predicted pressure falls below the minimum and is hence unsafe. From the predicted time history of free-stream dynamic pressure (q), it is noted that alarming increase in q can occur during starting and stopping transients, which can damage a test model in the tunnel, balance and such other components.
