It is very often used to tackle large-scale optimisation problems with a relatively high level of complexity. Therefore, it is of interest to have optimisation techniques dedicated to simulation-based optimisation. This paper proposes a simulation-based optimisation approach, called Constructive Cooperative Coevolutionary (C 3) search procedure, to optimise the control of interacting production stations. An optimisation algorithm {{is embedded in the}} C 3 search procedure to optimise subproblems separately. It includes a novel constructive heuristic that creates a feasible solution for the considered problem efficiently. It also incorporates an extended version of the existing cooperative coevolutionary method that can handle large-scale optimisation problems. Furthermore, this paper presents a case study considering a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> press <b>line</b> as an example of interacting production stations. In this case study, the performance of the proposed C 3 search procedure is evaluated and compared with other optimisation algorithms. This shows that the C 3 search procedure is able to successfully optimise the press line within a given number of fitness calculations, outperforming existing algorithms. Also, it is shown that C 3 can be embedded with either stochastic or deterministic optimisation algorithms, without sacrificing performance...|$|R
40|$|Simulation-based {{optimisation}} often considers computationally expensive problems. Successfully optimising {{such large}} scale and complex problems within a practical timeframe is a challenging task. Optimisation techniques to fulfil this {{need to be}} developed. A technique to address this involves decomposing the considered problem into smaller subproblems. These subproblems are then optimised separately. In this paper, an efficient algorithm for simulation-based optimisation is proposed. The proposed algorithm extends the cooperative coevolutionary algorithm, which optimises subproblems separately. To optimise the subproblems, the proposed algorithm enables using a deterministic algorithm, next to stochastic genetic algorithms, getting the flexibility of using either type. It also includes a constructive heuristic that creates good initial feasible solutions {{to reduce the number}} of fitness calculations. The extension enables solving complex, computationally expensive problems efficiently. The proposed algorithm has been applied on automated <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> press <b>lines</b> from the automotive industry. This is a highly complex optimisation problem due to its non-linearity and high dimensionality. The optimisation problem is to find control parameters that maximises the line's production rate. These control parameters determine velocities, time constants, and cam values for critical interactions between components. A simulation model is used for the fitness calculation during the optimisation. The results show that the proposed algorithm manages to solve the press line optimisation problem efficiently. This is a step forward in press line optimisation since this is to the authors' knowledge the first time a press line has been optimised efficiently in this way...|$|R

The goal is to minimize the effect of geometrical variation by optimizing the locating schemes for the parts. Several methods and tools are today present to support geometrical robustness optimization for parts but also for assemblies. In this paper focus is on geometrical decoupling, which is one parameter of geometrical robustness, of the different locating strategies in a complete assembly line. A goodness value is proposed that describe the level of geometrical couplings in a complete assembly line together with the part robustness value. By calculating this goodness value {{it is possible to}} predict the geometrical sensitivity of a complete assembly line as well as predicting the risk of geometrical variation on the final product.

40|$|Automobiles are an {{integral}} part of modern society and its way of life. In addition, automotive manufacturers are important institutions in society, summing the work of a vast array of sub suppliers, employing many. The margins are however moderate and competition is fierce. The automotive industry furthermore faces shifts of paradigms regarding propulsion as well as styling. Fundamental technical innovations, primarily to meet environmental requirements, that are moreover not a trivial issue to foresee, will affect all parts of the operation. It is thus important that product realization can respond quickly and effectively to market impulses using no more resources than necessary. Virtual models of products and processes are now developed long before any physical prototypes are built. However, whereas product and process now are represented in a virtual environment, the design parameters are still separately determined based on experience rather than mathematical analysis. Moreover, cost/capacity analysis is mainly separated from quality analysis, leading to either suboptimal cost/capacity or suboptimal quality. This work targets the car body, i. e. the Body-in-White, which is perhaps the most defining part of any car, with a significant influence on safety, aesthetics, handling, fuel economy and top speed. In the automotive industry, <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> assembly design has moved in the past 20 years from a physical to a virtual engineering environment. Typically, an automotive Body-in-White consists of about 300 steel <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> parts, joined by about 4000 spot welds. The workload is distributed to several hundred industrial joining and handling robots in about 80 stations, mainly organized in production <b>lines.</b> <b>Sheet</b> <b>metal</b> assembly is indeed an investment intense type of production. Thus it is important that the equipment is efficiently utilized. The balancing of weld work load between the executing stations and robots has a significant influence on achievable production rate and equipment utilization. Therefore the overall research question of this work is: How can Automatic Path Planning & Line Balancing, integrated with Dimensional Variation Analysis, make <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> assembly more cost-effective? This work presents a world first automatic simulation based <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> assembly <b>line</b> balancing method, which significantly increases assembly equipment utilization. Applied on industrial stud welding lines, the method produces line cycle times significantly better than those of the corresponding manually optimized running production programs. Using the proposed method on a stud welding line of 3 stations, 10 robots and about 200 stud welds, the workload can be executed with one station (of 2 robots) less and still with lower cycle time than that of the current running production programs. Furthermore, the time required to balance a line is reduced from several months to about one day. Due to the significant reduction in line balancing times, the method also has a significant impact on detailed process design iteration times, supporting concurrent product and process design. The method is moreover implemented in a widely used CAE-tool and is thus ready for broad based industrial application. This work furthermore increases knowledge regarding the trade-off between assembly equipment utilization and geometrical assembly variation, and how the two criteria can be jointly treated, in particular with respect to welding sequences. Furthermore, chronological and functional couplings between the design parameters that influence the two criteria are identified...|$|R

40|$|Motion {{planning}} for robot operations {{is concerned with}} path planning and trajectory generation. In multi-robot systems, i. e. with multiple robots operating simultaneously in a shared workspace, the motion planning also needs to coordinate the robots' motions to avoid collisions between them. The multi-robot coordination decides the cycle-time for the planned paths and trajectories since it determines to which extend the operations can take place simultaneously without colliding. To obtain the quickest cycle-time, there needs to bean optimal balance between, {{on the one hand}} short paths and fast trajectories, {{and on the other hand}} possibly longer paths and slower trajectories to allow that the operations take place simultaneously in the shared workspace. Due to the inter-dependencies, it becomes necessary to consider the path planning, trajectory generation and multi-robot coordination together as one optimisation problem in order to find this optimal balance. This thesis focusses on optimising the motion {{planning for}} multi-robot material handling systems of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> parts. A methodology to model the relevant aspects of this motion planning problem together as one multi-disciplinary optimisation problem for Simulation based Optimisation (SBO) is proposed. The identified relevant aspects include path planning,trajectory generation, multi-robot coordination, collision-avoidance, motion smoothness, end-effectors' holding force, cycle-time, robot wear, energy efficiency, part deformations, induced stresses in the part, and end-effectors' design. The cycle-time is not always the (only) objective since it is sometimes equally/more important to minimise robot wear, energy consumption, and/or part deformations. Different scenarios for these other objectives are therefore also investigated. Specialised single- and multi-objective algorithms are proposed for optimising the motion planning of these multi-robot systems. This thesis also investigates how to optimise the velocity and acceleration profiles of the coordinated trajectories for multi-robot material handling of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> parts. Another modelling methodology is proposed that is based on a novel mathematical model that parametrises the velocity and acceleration profiles of the trajectories, while including the relevant aspects of the motion planning problem excluding the path planning since the paths are now predefined. This enables generating optimised trajectories that have tailored velocity and acceleration profiles for the specific material handling operations in order to minimise the cycle-time,energy consumption, or deformations of the handled parts. The proposed methodologies are evaluated in different scenarios. This is done for real world industrial case studies that consider the multi-robot material handling of a multi-stage tandem <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> press <b>line,</b> which is used in the automotive industry to produce the cars' body panels.
