50|$|Unlike {{the later}} {{generation}} Beretta 92/96/M9 series, the Px4's trigger guard is rounded for better concealed carry. The takedown pin of earlier models {{is replaced by}} a spring-loaded bar, accessed via frame recesses on both sides, which must be grasped and pulled down simultaneously to release the slide. The slide spring is doubly captive, being inserted approximately an inch into the transfer block at one end and a receiving hole {{in the front of the}} slide at the other. It is a <b>self-contained</b> <b>assembly,</b> completely captured by the polymer guide. The magazine holds the top round directly behind the barrel's breech end so only a slight feed ramp is needed. This allows the barrel to fully support the case. The 6-R rifling of the barrel generates counter-clockwise torque which is harnessed by the locking system to reduce the amount of pressure required from the rotating barrel lock's cam and pin system to effect unlocking. The steel transfer block's cam pin is 5 mm wide and 2 mm deep. The entire hammer unit mechanism can be removed from the Px4, without the use of special tools, as a single group. This allows easy access to the firing mechanism for cleaning. The Px4's design makes it impossible to assemble incorrectly from a field-stripped takedown.|$|E
40|$|Spaceflight optical {{instruments}} have two conflicting requirements. They {{need to be}} both rigid and lightweight. In addition, for interferometric far ultraviolet spectrometers, the requirements for precision positioning are more severe than for conventional spectrometers. To {{meet the challenge of}} lightweight {{optical instruments}}, a modular adjustment mechanism was developed to position two orthogonal axes of a universal three-axis gimbal support system with a positioning accuracy on the order of 10 arc seconds. The mechanism was designed as a <b>self-contained</b> <b>assembly</b> which can be removed after final alignment of a spacebound optical instrument to reduce its in-flight mass. To demonstrate the concept, a number of these assemblies were made and mounted on two of the positioning axes of a far ultraviolet spatial heterodyne interferometer. A shaft clamp was used on each positioning axis to retain the adjusted position. This paper describes the design of the mechanism and presents optical test results...|$|E

40|$|High-level {{programming}} {{languages and}} bytecode-based virtual execution environments have become popular in software development. Bytecode-based runtimes extend embedded system by techniques to improve safety, help portability and interoperability. The ECMA/ISO Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specifies a bytecodebased execution environment (Common Language Runtime) and a comprehensive class library. CLI applications suffer from long startup time, high memory consumption {{and the amount}} of referenced assemblies. Startup time is determined by resolving references and high memory consumption through big class library assemblies. Often CLI applications use a small subset of the CLI class library, but the whole memory footprint is basically determined by the class library. To overcome memory requirements of the class library, a minimal application format that includes all essential class library functionality is reasonable. <b>Self-contained</b> CLI <b>assemblies</b> as an approach for size-optimized deployment format are presented in this paper...|$|R

The ECMA/ISO Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specifies a bytecode-based execution environment (Common Language Runtime) and a comprehensive class library. As Microsoft’s CLI implementation the.

Often CLI applications use a small subset of the CLI class library, but the whole memory footprint is basically determined by the class library. The loose coupling of CLI applications and utilized library features requires dynamic linking before execution. The process of dynamic linking causes long startup times and high memory consumption {{in addition to the}} high memory footprint of the CLI class library. For application in low-end embedded systems the memory footprint must be minimal. To overcome memory requirements of the class library, an minimal application format that includes all essential class library features is reasonable. <b>Self-contained</b> CLI <b>assemblies</b> as an approach for size-optimized deployment format for low-end embedded systems, are presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|On ITALSAT Flight 2, the Italian {{telecommunications}} satellite, the two L-Ka antennas (Tx and Rx) use {{two large}} deployable reflectors (2000 -mm diameter), whose deployment and fine pointing functions are accomplished {{by means of}} an innovative mechanism concept. The Antenna Deployment & Pointing Mechanism and Supporting Structure (ADPMSS) is based on a new configuration solution, where the reflector and mechanisms are conceived as an integrated, <b>self-contained</b> <b>assembly.</b> This approach is different from the traditional configuration solution. Typically, a rigid arm is used to deploy and then support the reflector in the operating position, and an Antenna Pointing Mechanism (APM) is normally interposed between the reflector and the arm for steering operation. The main characteristics of the ADPMSS are: combined implementation of deployment, pointing, and reflector support; optimum integration of active components and interface matching with the satellite platform; structural link distribution to avoid hyperstatic connections; very light weight and; high performance in terms of deployment torque margin and pointing range/accuracy. After having successfully been subjected to all component-level qualification and system-level acceptance tests, two flight ADPMSS mechanisms (one for each antenna) are now integrated on ITALSAT F 2 and are ready for launch. This paper deals with the design concept, development, and testing program performed to qualify the ADPMSS mechanism...|$|E
40|$|A special nozzle {{has been}} made with {{associated}} ducting and instruments {{in order to provide}} an absolute measure of airflow. The equipment could form a portable <b>self-contained</b> <b>assembly,</b> enabling calibrations to be made of meters installed in test rigs. In order to give an absolute measurement, the nozzle has been designed to generate an idealised flow amenable both to theoretical prediction and to experimental survey. Firstly, the nozzle produces a uniform velocity profile across the mainstream, which can easily be traversed for pitot and static pressure to a high order of accuracy. Secondly, the boundary layer is fairly thin in the traverse plane, thus minimising the effect of variations within it on nozzle C/). The discharge coefficient has been determined by traversing within the flow range from 6 to 18 Ib/sec. The theoretical calculation of C D is in good agreement with the 'traverse ' results. The uncertainty of an airflow measurement in a steady flow is estimated as _+ 0. 17 per cent due to known random errors. By far the biggest error is that resulting from circumferential variation of the boundary-layer profiles. It is felt that much of the error from the boundary layer could be removed with the manufacture of a new nozzle. An extensive subsidiary experimental programme has been carried out {{to solve the problem of}} the accurat...|$|E
40|$|To {{establish}} {{practices and}} technological environments for using automated production systems in manufacturing of optoelectronic products, with characteristics of high customization of final products, of low volumes, make to order and especially of high manual activity {{is a challenge}} crucial {{for the future of}} manufacturing in Europe for this manufacturing sector. White’R is an FP 7 -FoF-EU Project where the main goal is to design and produce a modular- adaptive – self-containedreconfigurable robotic island in a white room for production of two different types of optoelectronic products with features described above: laser diodes and solar cells. In this paper the production planning, scheduling and control issues of white’R for HMLV optoelectronics is discussed and a management integration framework is proposed. The management framework presented in this work aims to sustain any company employing a self-contained automated and re-configurable robotic assembly island to organize and unify the development of its manufacturing capabilities still guaranteeing the alignment with the organizational strategy developed at the highest level of an organization. Two real cases are presented but the framework is applicable to any company in the sector analyzed. This is the first paper with application of a general framework for HMLV products in a white room based, <b>self-contained</b> highly automated <b>assembly</b> environment...|$|R

These modular units would be manufactured at a single centralized facility, transported by rail, road, and/or ship, and installed as a series of self-contained units. This approach also allows for staged construction of an NPP and ''pull and replace'' refueling and maintenance during each five-year refueling cycle. Development of the baseline design concept has been sufficiently completed to determine that it complies with the safety requirements and criteria, and satisfies the major goals already noted. The more significant features of the baseline single-unit design concept include: (1) Thermal Power [...] 150 MWt; (2) Net Electrical Output [...] 35 MWe; (3) Steam Generator Type [...] Vertical, helical tubes; (4) Fuel UO{sub 2 }, 8 % enriched; (5) Refueling Intervals [...] 5 years; (6) Life-Cycle [...] 60 years. The economic performance was assessed by designing a power plant with an electric generation capacity in the range of current and advanced evolutionary systems. This approach allows for direct comparison of economic performance and forms a basis for further evaluation, economic and technical, of the proposed design and for the design evolution towards a more cost competitive concept. Applications such as cogeneration, water desalination or district heating were not addressed directly in the economic analyses since these depend more on local conditions, demand and economy and can not be easily generalized. Current economic performance experience and available cost data were used. The preliminary cost estimate, based on a concept that could be deployed in less than a decade, is: (1) Net Electrical Output [...] 1050 MWe; (2) Net Station Efficiency [...] 23 %; (3) Number of Power Units [...] 30; (4) Nominal Plant Capacity Factor [...] 95 %; (5) Total capital cost [...] $ 1241 /kWe; and (6) Total busbar cost [...] 3. 4 cents/kWh. The project includes a testing program that has been conducted at Oregon State University (OSU). The test facility is a 1 / 3 -height and 1 / 254. 7 volume scaled design that will operate at full system pressure and temperature, and will be capable of operation at 600 kW. The design and construction of the facility have been completed. Testing is scheduled to begin in October 2002. The MASLWR conceptual design is simple, safe, and economical. It operates at NSSS parameters much lower than for a typical PWR plant, and has a much simplified power generation system. The individual reactor modules can be operated as on/off units, thereby limiting operational transients to startup and shutdown. In addition, a plant can be built in increments that match demand increases. The ''pull and replace'' concept offers automation of refueling and maintenance activities. Performing refueling in a single location improves proliferation resistance and eliminates the threat of diversion. Design certification based on testing is simplified because of the relatively low cost of a full-scale prototype facility. The overall conclusion is that while the efficiency of the power generation unit is much lower (23 % versus 30 %), the reduction in capital cost due to simplification of design more than makes up for the increased cost of nuclear fuel. The design concept complies with the safety requirements and criteria. It also satisfies the goals for modularity, standard plant design, certification before construction, construction schedule, refueling schedule, operation and maintenance, long plant life-cycle, and economics...|$|E
