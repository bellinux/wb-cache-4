5|$|Lorne Michaels said The Land of Gorch {{characters}} {{had been}} created without {{a set of rules}} or boundaries to govern the storylines. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> his writing staff {{would have been able to}} work more effectively if there had been more guidelines on the characters' behavior and function. Henson <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the type of humor being written for the show was tedious and unimaginative.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} later, an {{attorney}} from the International Trade Commission filed an opinion for another case that <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the related patents from Trend Micro were invalid. Fortinet {{made a new}} legal filing and in December 2010, the US Patent and Trademark Office declared the patents as invalid.|$|E
5|$|There was one {{change of}} driver before the race. Jon Wood, the {{grandson}} of retired driver Glen Wood, was originally scheduled to replace 1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion Bill Elliott in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing car, but withdrew {{because of a lack}} of experience with the Car of Tomorrow, and former Haas CNC Racing driver Johnny Sauter took over his seat. Wood <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> Sauter was a better qualifier and Elliott was not available to drive. Kahne developed a sinus infection two days before the event, and his team had Nationwide Series driver Jason Keller ready to replace him if he could not compete.|$|E

5|$|Cinematographer Russell Boyd largely {{utilized}} available {{light to}} give the movie a natural feel, which Beresford said was crucial to its sense of authenticity. Harper said Boyd was so quiet during filming that he mostly used just three words: Yeah', 'right' and 'sure. Beresford, Foote and Duvall considered the climactic scene {{to be the one}} in which Mac, tending the family garden, discusses with Rosa Lee his pain over his daughter's death. Beresford and Boyd filmed the scene in a long take and long shot so it could flow uninterrupted, with the lonely Texas landscape captured in the background. When studio executives received the footage, they contacted Beresford and requested close-up shots be intercut, but he insisted on keeping the long take intact. Duvall <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the scene underscored Mac's stoicism in the face of tragedy and loss.|$|E
5|$|Shadrick {{enrolled}} in Pineville High School in 1947 and received top marks in his classes. During {{his sophomore year}} in 1948, he developed an interest in football and made the school's team, though he was small for his age. The team could not afford uniforms, and Shadrick's father gave him five dollars to buy one, but it was stolen from his locker in October 1948. The incident upset Shadrick so much {{he dropped out of}} school, reportedly refusing to return from that day forward. One month later, he and a friend enlisted in the U.S. Army. Shadrick's father would later refer to the stolen school uniform as the reason Shadrick enlisted in the military, and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> it indirectly caused his son's death.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Osan was {{the first}} U.S. ground action of the war. The fight showed that American forces were weak and {{unprepared}} for the war; outdated equipment was insufficient to fight North Korean armor and poorly trained and inexperienced units were no match for better-trained North Korean troops– though the disparity in number of troops engaged certainly {{had a profound effect}} on the outcome of this and future battles. Undisciplined U.S. troops abandoned their positions prematurely, leaving equipment and wounded for North Korean troops to capture. Smith also <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> he had stayed too long in his position, allowing North Korean troops to envelop the force and cause heavy casualties as it retreated. These weaknesses would play out with other U.S. units for the next month as North Korean troops pushed them further back.|$|E

5|$|In March 2007, Copeland {{became a}} key figure in an alleged steroid ring and drug investigation. On March 19, Sports Illustrated posted an article on its website in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Copeland, who was alleged to have obtained HGH. Copeland has previously admitted to using steroids in April 2004 after neck surgery as an experiment on TSN's Off The Record with Michael Landsberg in January 2005. He <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> it slowed him down, so he quickly got off the substance. According to Copeland, he took HGH after returning from a spinal fusion neck surgery. He was told by doctors that it would help the bones grow back around the screws and plate that were inserted into his neck. He claims to have taken blood tests, consulted doctors, studied the drug, and got prescriptions before deciding to take them.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 2016, Wade announced, in {{a letter}} to Miami, that he had agreed to join the Chicago Bulls on a two-year deal worth $47.5 million. Wade <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{unwanted}} and under-appreciated by Heat president Pat Riley, and noted that his relationship with Riley was in tatters by the end of negotiations. On July 15, he officially signed with the Bulls. He made his debut for the Bulls in their season opener on October 27, scoring 22 points with four made three-pointers in a 105–99 win over the Boston Celtics. The next day, Wade was fined $25,000 for making a throat slash gesture after a game-sealing three-point shot. On November 4, he scored 35 points on 12-of-20 shooting in a 117–104 loss to the New York Knicks. He made five three-pointers to give him 10 in five games in 2016–17; he had a total of seven in 2015–16. On January 21, 2017, he had 30 points and two key steals in the final minute of the Bulls' 102–99 win over the Sacramento Kings. After questioning the desire of the team's younger players following a loss to the Atlanta Hawks on January 25, Wade was fined and held out of the starting lineup against Miami on January 27 as punishment. On March 16, 2017, Wade underwent an MRI for a right elbow injury suffered {{in the fourth quarter of}} the Bulls' game against the Memphis Grizzlies the previous night. The results of the MRI showed a sprain and a small fracture in the elbow. Wade returned to action on April 8, 2017, scoring 14 points in a 107–106 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.|$|E

25|$|Breitbart and O'Keefe on September 11 {{announced}} that O'Keefe {{would not agree}} {{to be interviewed by}} CNN staff. They said that CNN favored ACORN in its coverage. But, CNN had reported on ACORN-related issues of alleged voter registration fraud (which were not substantiated). O'Keefe <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> CNN's early coverage had been slanted in favor of ACORN, because CNN had interviewed both ACORN staff members and defenders.|$|E

25|$|On February 5, 1976, a United States army recruit at Fort Dix <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{tired and}} weak. He died the next day, {{and four of}} his fellow {{soldiers}} were later hospitalized. Two weeks after his death, health officials announced {{the cause of death}} was a new strain of swine flu. The strain, a variant of H1N1, is known as A/New Jersey/1976 (H1N1). It was detected only from January 19 to February 9 and did not spread beyond Fort Dix.|$|E
25|$|Fanny {{suggested}} that Mrs Troake {{use a small}} pastry boat filled with fruit sorbet and covered with spun sugar, decorated with an orange slice and a cherry through a cocktail stick to give the dish {{the look of a}} small boat, suitable, Fanny thought, for the naval guests.

Robert Morley had also been consulted on the menu and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that Mrs Troake's original coffee pudding was perfect.|$|E

25|$|Wittgenstein's {{influence}} has been felt {{in nearly every}} field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are diverging interpretations of his thought. In the words of his friend and colleague Georg Henrik von Wright: He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{as though he was}} writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.|$|E
25|$|On September 2, 2008, the UFC {{announced}} it had signed Couture {{to a new}} three-fight contract.

In a post-fight interview with Joe Rogan, Couture declared his desire to keep fighting and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> he was still becoming a better fighter, blaming the loss on his performance, not his age.|$|E
