The recommendation was unanimously supported by the NDP caucus, and she became interim leader on July 28, 2011, when the party’s federal council voted to <b>support</b> <b>Jack</b> Layton's recommendation. At the time, because Parliament was in summer recess and Layton was hoping to return when Parliament resumed in September, Turmel did not formally assume the role of Leader of the Official Opposition. She only assumed that office upon Jack Layton's death on August 22, 2011, and she stands as just the second woman to have held the role, after former Canadian Alliance MP Deborah Grey, who served in 2000 during that party's leadership race. Turmel chose not to move into Stornoway, as her home and riding is in the National Capital Region, though she has used Stornoway for entertaining and has slept over on occasion.|$|E

5000|$|Since the lawsuit, {{there have}} been many changes in Newman Enterprises in terms of CEO. When Victor was jailed, Adam Newman took on the roll of CEO, but Victor later returned. A few months later, Victor {{disappeared}} because of mental health issues, and his then-wife, Sharon Newman took over the roll of CEO out of revenge towards the Newmans, mainly Victor, Nicholas, Victoria, Abby, Adam and Nikki. A court ruling made Victoria Newman acting CEO while Sharon underwent court ordered psychological evaluation, but the decision was reversed soon after. Sharon's tenure as CEO saw stocks at Newman plummet, but her term ended once Victor returned alive retaking control of his company. Due to the plummet in stocks, Tucker McCall conspired with Jack Abbott in a hostile takeover to control Newman Enterprises. They purchased significant stock. With Tucker's <b>support,</b> <b>Jack</b> was successful in his bid to become CEO. Jack fired Victor, Victoria, and Nicholas as he planned to change the face of the company by renaming it [...] "Abbott Enterprises".

Jack was going to tell Janet it was over after he and Carly had decided to be together; unfortunately, when Jack went to tell Janet she was bawling because Liberty is diagnosed with leukemia (cancer). At Janet's reluctant request, her father, Rocco, arrived in Oakdale as a possible bone-marrow donor for Liberty. However, Liberty refuses her grandfather's bone marrow, accusing him of only ever even meeting Liberty because she was dying. Jack now thinks he has to stay with Janet to give her and Liberty <b>support.</b> <b>Jack</b> is still unfaithful with Carly, Carly then walks in on Janet and Dusty kissing, she plans to use this to break the couple up.

50|$|One night, {{an aerial}} battle occurs near the island while the boys sleep, during which a fighter pilot ejects from his plane and dies in the descent. His body drifts {{down to the}} island in his parachute; both get tangled in a tree {{near the top of}} the mountain. Later on, while Jack {{continues}} to scheme against Ralph, the twins Sam and Eric, now assigned to the maintenance of the signal fire, see the corpse of the fighter pilot and his parachute in the dark. Mistaking the corpse for the beast, they run to the cluster of shelters that Ralph and Simon have erected to warn the others. This unexpected meeting again raises tensions between Jack and Ralph. Shortly thereafter, Jack decides to lead a party to the other side of the island, where a mountain of stones, later called Castle Rock, forms a place where he claims the beast resides. Only Ralph and a quiet suspicious boy, Jack's closest supporter Roger, agree to go; Ralph turns back shortly before the other two boys but eventually all three see the parachutist, whose head rises via the wind. They then flee, now believing the beast is truly real. When they arrive at the shelters, Jack calls an assembly and tries to turn the others against Ralph, asking them to remove Ralph from his position. Receiving no <b>support,</b> <b>Jack</b> storms off alone to form his own tribe. Roger immediately sneaks off to join Jack, and slowly an increasing amount of older boys abandon Ralph to join Jack's tribe. Jack's tribe continues to lure recruits from the main group by promising feasts of cooked pig. The members begin to paint their faces and enact bizarre rites, including sacrifices to the beast. One night, Ralph and Piggy decide to go to one of Jack's feasts.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of forces on two tree intermediate supports is presented. The analysis is in two parts: The maximum force that the <b>support</b> <b>jack</b> will experience. The movement and forces {{created in the}} two tree support by the skyline and carriage. The maximum force on the <b>support</b> <b>jack</b> occurs when the carriage moves onto the jack. The support line tension varies with changes in skyline geometry and support tree geometry. The equations developed to accomplish the above analysis require iteration {{to arrive at the}} solution. Computer programs developed for the Hewlett Packard 9830 desk top computer are presented. The computer programs solve for the maximum force on the jack, the <b>support</b> <b>jack</b> movement, and the support line tension. Tensions in an experimental multi-span skyline were measured to test assumptions made during the analysis. The assumptions appear to cause the computer programs to overestimate the support line tension. The two-tree analysis was used to analyze two current multi-span problems: Skyline spans that create a horizontal angle in the skyline at the <b>support</b> <b>jack.</b> Maximum support line tensions. The two problems were analyzed by using two hypothetical multi-span skylines and the two-tree support computer programs...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{catenary}} {{analysis of}} static skyline, mainline and haulback cable tensions {{just prior to}} an unsuccessful attempt by a carriage to pass an intermediate <b>support</b> <b>jack</b> is presented. Field tests were conducted {{for a range of}} skyline deflections and span chord slopes. Data collected during the field tests included static and dynamic cable tensions and cable geometry. The relationship between upper span skyline deflection, the percent change in span chord slopes, and their influence on successful carriage passage was determined. During the field tests it was observed that maintaining a taut haulback as the carriage passed the <b>support</b> <b>jack</b> prevented the carriage from surging out of control and reduced dynamic tension fluctuations. It was also observed that yarding the loaded carriage uphill over the <b>support</b> <b>jack</b> was prohibited by skyline deflections which still allowed successful carriage passage for the downhill yarding configuration...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Presentation date: 1978 - 05 - 05 Critical skyline and {{mainline}} tensions {{were identified}} as the conditions necessary for successful carriage passage uphill over an intermediate <b>support</b> <b>jack.</b> These critical tensions were measured during field tests and compared with predicted values from weightless line, rigid link, and catenary analyses. All three analyses predicted critical skyline tensions {{within the range of}} field measured values while critical mainline tensions were consistently overestimated. An existing computer multispan skyline analysis program (MSAP) was modified using the rigid link analysis to check for critical tensions at the <b>support</b> <b>jack.</b> A. comparison of MSAP results with measured field values showed good agreement for skyline tension and conservative estimates for mainline tension. As an alternative to the computer program, a graphical method for determining the critical midspan deflection was developed, patterned after the chain and board method. The analysis and test results indicated that present multispan design criteria for uphill yarding were overly conservative in many instances. To evaluate the economic effects of designing below system potential, yarding costs/mbf were compared, on a typical setting, based on predicted payloads using present and new design methods. Results of this comparison, based on payload effects only, showed that a considerable economic advantage existed when the new design procedure was used...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} program package to estimate cable yarding payload capability was made. The package {{was intended to}} expand applicability of existing packages and to be user friendly. It has six system options: live skyline, standing skyline, running skyline, slackline, multispan and highlead. In the standing skyline and multispan analyses, load path analysis, as well as payload anaiysis, is available as an optional basis. Each program {{for the analysis of}} a system was built to include subroutines to consider its mechanical characteristics, which are usually ignored in existing packages. The running skyline program has an option to consider the maximum torque on the haulback drum. The highlead analysis program has an option to consider the effect of cable drag. The inultispan has a subroutine to check carriage passage over a <b>support</b> <b>jack</b> and an option to consider the effect of jack friction. In addition, the effect of log drag and log shape as well as choking strategy can be considered as an optional basis. The paper was written to present the mathematical formulations and modeling procedures used in building the package. In addition, outputs of an example run for each system are presented with interpretations...|$|E
40|$|Background: Meeting {{changes can}} be very {{problematic}} for children with AutismSpectrum Disorders (ASDs) whereas other children may take it for granted. As a result,they may cry, get upset, scream, do hand flapping or even self-harming that shows their inability {{to cope with the}} changes and their preference of sameness and routine activities. To understand the issue of changes in children with autism, people should know the complexity of the disorders. Purpose: This article will explain further about the strategies for successful transition into mainstream schools for young children with autism as illustrated in Jack’s case study in the appendices. Methods: A case study was conducted to one respondent. Firstly, the article will explain ASDs and its atypical characteristics of 6 -years old Jack. Then it will discuss strategies to help Jack’s transition process, as well as strategies to support his learning process during schooling which finally comes up with conclusion to <b>support</b> <b>Jack</b> and his family’s transition into mainstream primary education. Results: Strategies for successful transition into mainstream schools for young children with autism include using visual information and activity schedules, managing sensory overload, and building literacy skills.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Presentation date: 1988 - 09 - 02 Multispan skyline logging {{systems are}} cable systems {{designed}} to yard logs over steep terrain having a constant or convex slope. An intermediate skyline support {{is used to}} raise the skyline high enough to achieve ground clearance without overstressing the skyline. Certain improvements in performance can be realized by providing intermediate support for the mainline {{as well as the}} skyline. A computer model has been developed to compare the performance of two possible suspended-mainline multispan logging systems. One of the systems is capable of suspending the mainline at the skyline intermediate support using a compound jack, and the other, the squirrel carriage, suspends the mainline from a pair of sheaves which are free to change location under the influence of cable forces. The computer model is capable of predicting the effect of different parameters on the performance of the logging systems. Simulations on a typical logging setting, varying one parameter at a time, suggest that: (1) Either system of suspending the mainline can potentially improve net payload, ground clearance of the mainline, and the likelihood of successful passage of the skyline carriage over the intermediate <b>support</b> <b>jack.</b> (2) The compound jack system is capable of better performance than the squirrel carriage system under most conditions. (3) The squirrel carriage system performance improves on steeper slopes and with optimum squirrel carriage weight. Squirrel carriage performance worsens as the ground profile becomes more convex...|$|E
