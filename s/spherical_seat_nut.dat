40|$|On February 14, 1980, {{the solar}} maximum mission (SMM) {{satellite}} was launched into orbit with experiments to monitor solar activity. In {{order to obtain}} common object observations, experiments must be coaligned within 90 arc-seconds of the spacecraft pointing vector. Hardware designed to minimize structural and thermal distortions of the experiment support plate is described. Coalignment was provided through control of interface which combined flexible blades to limit load transfer and <b>spherical</b> <b>seats</b> for alignment reference...|$|R
50|$|Alignment of {{the test}} {{specimen}} in the testing machine is critical, because if the specimen is misaligned, either at an angle or offset to one side, the machine will exert a bending force on the specimen. This is especially bad for brittle materials, because it will dramatically skew the results. This situation can be minimized by using <b>spherical</b> <b>seats</b> or U-joints between the grips and the test machine. If the initial portion of the stress-strain curve is curved and not linear, it indicates the specimen is misaligned in the testing machine.|$|R
50|$|The jack is {{rigid and}} robust. The upright column is {{fabricated}} and welded to the cast steel Gear Box. The elevating screw {{is provided with}} buttress thread supported with single-acting thrust ball-bearing having a <b>spherical</b> <b>seating</b> {{at the top and}} self-aligning ball-bearing at the bottom. This imparts self-aligning properties to the screw under loaded condition. The elevating screw is under tension when loaded and hence there is no chance of distortion due to buckling.While lifting the load, the Jack rests firmly on its base. For movement from one place to another, the lifting carriage is to be lowered by pressing the yoke which lifts the base and the Jack rests on the three wheels with a ground clearance of 20 mm.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{analyzes the}} performance of a magnetic fluid based squeeze film for a sphere in a rough <b>spherical</b> <b>seat</b> with slip velocity. The slip model of Beavers and Joseph has been deployed to study the effect of velocity slip while the stochastic model of Christensen and Tonder has been used to calculate the effect of surface roughness. The concerned statistically averaged Reynolds’ type equation is solved to derive the pressure distribution which results in the calculation of load carrying capacity. The results presented in graphical forms confirm that the adverse effect of slip velocity can be overcome to a large extent at least in the case of negatively skewed roughness. However, lower values of slip may be preferred for enhancing the performance characteristics of the bearing system. Besides, variance (−ve) provides a little support to improve the performance characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Six Sigma is {{the concept}} of {{improving}} the quality by reducing process variations, making con-tinuous improvements, reducing defect rates and improving the processes. Initially, the concept of Six Sigma focused on defect reduction, cost reduction and value addition. Fundamentally the basic idea of Six Sigma is to improve the process-capability and making the process more relia-ble along with reducing wastes within industries. Evaluation the implication of applying Six Sigma over the small and medium-sized enterprises is the main purpose of this research work taking a particular case of automobile industries. In the present work, DMAIC methodology of Six Sigma is used to a small <b>seat</b> slider lock <b>nut</b> manufacturing unit to reduce the play issue in K 2 seat slider lock in automobile units by reducing defects inherent in the process. After apply-ing Six Sigma methodology, it was found that manufacturing units could earn profits in terms of reducing the wastage as well as improving the quality standard of the product by controlling the play issue in <b>seat</b> slider lock <b>nut</b> mechanism. Result shows that with the application of Six Sig-ma, process, sigma level brought up to 5. 53 σ from 1. 59 σ by varying the <b>seat</b> slider lock <b>nut</b> di-mensions/size. ...|$|R
50|$|Wheels must {{be fitted}} {{with the correct}} type of lug nuts on wheel studs, or bolts. Lug nuts (aka wheel nuts in British English) are usually either flat, tapered (generally at 60 degrees and {{referred}} to as conical seat), or ball seats, meaning the mounting surfaces are flat, tapered, or spherical respectively.Most Mercedes have ball lug seats from the factory while most aftermarket wheels have a tapered lug design. Wrong lug nuts for the wheel will not properly center it and cause wobble. Some manufacturers (e.g. Toyota and Lexus) have used taper lug nuts for steel wheels and flat <b>seated</b> lug <b>nuts</b> for alloy wheels.|$|R
40|$|Tubes can be flared first, then {{attached}} to valves and other flow line components, with new fitting {{that can be}} disassembled and reused. Installed fitting can be disassembled so parts can be inspected. It can be salvaged and reused without damaging flared tube; tube can be coated, tempered, or otherwise treated {{after it has been}} flared, rather than before, as was previously required. Fitting consists of threaded male portion with conical <b>seating</b> surface, hexagonal <b>nut</b> with hole larger than other diameter of flared end of tube, and split ferrule...|$|R
50|$|The lug's taper is {{normally}} 60 degrees (although 45 {{is common for}} wheels designed for racing applications), and is designed to center the wheel accurately on the axle, and to reduce the tendency for the nut to loosen, due to fretting induced precession, as the car is driven. Honda uses a spherical rather than a tapered <b>seat,</b> but the <b>nut</b> performs the same function. Older style (non-ferrous) alloy wheels have a 1/2 to 1 inch cylindrical shank slipping into the wheel to center it and a washer that applies pressure to clamp the wheel to the axle.|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 33 - 45 This paper reviews a long {{standing}} issue {{related to the}} stiffness and damping coefficients of tilting-pad (TP) bearings; namely, What {{is the nature of}} their frequency dependency? A research project was implemented at the Turbomachinery Laboratory (TL) at Texas A&M University (TAMU) around 2003 to examine the issue, applying procedures that had been developed and used to investigate the rotordynamic characteristics of annular gas seals. Those seals, using a smooth rotor and a honeycomb or hole-pattern stator were predicted to have strongly frequency-dependent reaction forces that could not be modeled by a combination of stiffness, damping, and inertia coefficients. Measurements confirmed the strongly frequency dependent nature of their stiffness and damping coefficients. Subsequent test have examined the following bearing types: (i) Two-axial-groove bearing, (ii) pressure dam bearings, (iii) Flexure-pivot-pad tilting-pad bearing (FPTP) in load-on-pad (LOP) and load-between-pad (LBP), (iv) Rocker-pivot-pad TP bearing in LOP and LBP configurations at two different preloads and 50 and 60 % offsets, and (v) a <b>spherical</b> <b>seat</b> bearing in LOP and LBP configurations. Representative test results are presented for some of these bearings. In addition, this paper includes experimental results for 5 -pad and 4 -pad tilting pad bearings (with similar features to TAMU configuration iv) tested at the GE Global Research Facility (GRC) as part of an independent research initiative from GE Oil and Gas. Frequency effects on the dynamic-stiffness coefficients were investigated by applying dynamic-force excitation over a range of excitation frequencies. Generally, for all bearings tested at TAMU and GRC, the direct real parts of the dynamic-stiffness coefficients could be modeled as quadratic functions of the excitation frequency and accounted for by adding a mass matrix to the conventional [C][K] model to produce a frequency-independent [M][C][K] model. Additionally, the direct damping could be modeled by a constant, frequency-independent coefficient. Consequently, these experimental findings from two independent sources support the use of synchronously reduced force coefficients for characterizing the dynamic performance of tilting pad bearings in Oil and Gas applications, as prescribed by API 617 7 th edition (Process Centrifugal Compressors) and more generally by API 684 Rotordynamic Tutorial...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} mechanisms that cause bolt loosening, {{which is a}} concern for automobile manufacturers. Specifically, experimental analysis is conducted in order to ascertain stress distribution patterns when bolts loosen under vibration testing conditions. The insights gained from this analysis are then used to reproduce actual machine tests in a simulator based on a technical element model for highly accurate CAE analysis. Looking at pressure distribution on the <b>nut</b> <b>seating</b> surface (the trigger for thread loosening), the authors were able to clearly and rationally clarify {{the degree to which}} this pressure distribution CAE, bolt-loosening, thread portions of nuts and bolts impacted the contact points between nut and bolt threads. The results can contribute to the formulation of problem prevention methods for product design based on a predictive technical evaluation process that does not rely on actual machine testing. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} design of an all metal, fast response, bipropellant, shut-off valve {{for use on}} long duration space missions is reported. The valve provides the flow control capability for a 1, 000 lb thrust, bipropellant engine using oxygen difluoride and diborane as propellants. The shutoff seal selection is a soft-on-hard metal concept. The soft seal is a <b>spherical</b> shell that <b>seats</b> against a hard conical seat. Beryllium copper and beryllium nickel seals were selected to seal against an electrolyzed Inconel 718 seat. Poppet shaft sealing is achieved by use of hydroformed, Inconel 718 bellows. Two valve assemblies were fabricated and subjected {{to a series of}} tests including leak, response time, flow capacity, dry cycles, water cycles, liquid nitrogen cycles, liquid fluorine cycles, and lead-lag operation cycles. These tests demonstrated the ability of the valve to meet design goals...|$|R
40|$|In the {{interest}} of providing more effective evaluations of impact wrench vibration exposures {{and the development of}} improved methods for measuring vibration emissions produced by these tools, this study focused on three variables: acceleration measured at the tool surface, vibration exposure duration per test trial, and the amount of torque required to unseat the nuts following a test trial. For this evaluation, six experienced male impact wrench operators used three samples each of five impact wrench models (four pneumatic models and one battery-powered model) in a simulated work task. The test setup and procedures were based on those provided by an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee overseeing the revision of ISO 8662 - 7. The work task involved the <b>seating</b> of 10 <b>nuts</b> onto 10 bolts mounted on steel plates. The results indicate that acceleration magnitudes vary not only by tool type but also by individual tools within a type. Thus, evaluators are cautioned against drawing conclusions based on small numbers of tools and/or tool operators. Appropriate sam-ple sizes are suggested. It was further noted that evaluators could draw different conclusions if tool assessments are based on ISO-weighted acceleration as opposed to unweighted accel-eration. As expected, vibration exposure durations varied by tool type and by test subject; duration means varied more for study participants than they did for tool types. For the 12 pneumatic tools evaluated in this study, torque varied directly with tool handle acceleration. Therefore, in order to reduce vibration exposure, tools should be selected and adjusted so that they produce no more than the needed torque for the task at hand...|$|R
