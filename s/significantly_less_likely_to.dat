25|$|Absolute {{pitch is}} {{considerably}} {{more common among}} those whose early childhood was spent in East Asia. This {{might seem to be}} a genetic difference; however, people of East Asian ancestry who are reared in North America are <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop absolute pitch than those raised in East Asia, so the difference is more probably explained by experience. The language that is spoken may be an important factor; many East Asians speak tonal languages such as Mandarin and Cantonese, while others (such as those in Japan and certain provinces of Korea) speak pitch-accent languages, and the prevalence of absolute pitch may be partly explained by exposure to pitches together with meaningful musical labels very early in life.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explore whether firms that have {{received}} VC investment {{are subject to}} the same recessionary pressures as other small firms, or if receipt of VC incurs resilience to macroeconomic turbulence. It examines the survival and exit patterns of UK venture capital investments during the recessionary periodsGreat Recession of 2008 - 9, and compares these patterns to the dot-com boom and bust of 1999 - 2001. Using a new dataset of over 5000 investments made by UK Venture Capital Trusts (VCT) from 1995 - 2009, the paper uses using Cox survival models to examine the impact of macroeconomic turbulence on duration of investment.

25|$|Groups {{may differ}} in how a disease progresses. Black {{men who were}} {{diagnosed}} with HIV generally fared worse than their white and Hispanic counterparts. The percentage of men studied with very low CD4+ T-cell count, defined as fewer than 50 cells per microliter, at AIDS diagnosis was 24.1% for white men, 27.8% for Hispanic men, and 34.4% for Black men. Black men were also <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be alive three years after diagnosis (80.6%) than Hispanic or white men, who had 85.2% and 84.5% survival rates, respectively.

25|$|The {{continued}} use of racial categories has been criticized. Apart from the general controversy regarding race, some argue that the {{continued use}} of racial categories {{in health care and}} as risk factors could result in increased stereotyping and discrimination in society and health services. Some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities. For example, some racial groups are less likely than others to receive adequate treatment for osteoporosis, even after risk factors have been assessed. Since the 19th century, blacks have been thought to have thicker bones than whites have and to lose bone mass more slowly with age. In a recent study, African Americans were shown to be substantially less likely to receive prescription osteoporosis medications than Caucasians. Men were also <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be treated compared with women. This discrepancy may be due to physicians' knowledge that, on average, African Americans are at lower risk for osteoporosis than Caucasians. It may be possible that these physicians generalize this data to high-risk African-Americans, leading them to fail to appropriately assess and manage these individuals' osteoporosis. On the other hand, some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities.|$|E
500|$|The {{issue of}} local {{historic}} districts {{and the impact}} on property values is a concern to many homeowners. The effects have been extensively studied using multiple methodologies including before-and-after analysis and evaluating comparable neighborhoods with and without local designation status. [...] Recent factual analysis has been conducted by independent researchers {{in a number of}} states, including New Jersey, Texas, Indiana, Georgia, Colorado, Maryland, North and South Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia, and elsewhere. As stated by economist Donovan Rypkema, [...] "the results of these studies are remarkably consistent: property values in local historic districts appreciate significantly faster than the market as a whole {{in the vast majority of}} cases and appreciate at rates equivalent to the market in the worst case. Simply put – historic districts enhance property values." [...] In a 2011 study Connecticut Local Historic Districts and Property Values, it was found that [...] "property values in every local historic district saw average increases in value ranging from 4% to over 19% per year." [...] Similarly, in New York City between 1980 and 2000, local historic district properties on a price per square foot basis increased in value significantly more than non-designated properties. [...] Equally important, local historic district property values were found to resist market downturns better than historic non-designated properties. [...] A recent study investigating the data on single-family residential mortgage foreclosures and comparable non-designated neighborhoods found that designated properties were <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> experience foreclosure. Local historic district designation has proven to protect property values from wild fluctuations and provides stability in the housing market.|$|E

40|$|Young {{people tend}} to {{disclose}} relationship violence experiences to their peers, if they disclose at all, yet {{little is known about}} the nature and frequency of adolescent help-seeking and help-giving behaviors. Conducted within a sample of 1, 312 young people from four New York City high schools, this is the first paper to ask adolescent help-givers about the various forms of help they provide and among the first to examine how ethnicity and nativity impact help-seeking behaviors. Relationship violence victims who had ever disclosed (61 %) were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> choose their friends for informal support. Ethnicity was predictive of adolescent disclosure outlets, whereas gender and nativity were not. Latinos were <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than non-Latinos <b>to</b> ever disclose to only friends, as compared to disclosing to at least one adult. The likelihood of a young person giving help to their friend in a violent relationship is associated with gender, ethnicity, and nativity, with males being <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than females <b>to</b> give all forms of help to their friends (talking to their friends about the violence, suggesting options, and taking action). Foreign-born adolescents are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> talk or suggest options to friends in violent relationships. This study also found that Latinos were significantly more <b>likely</b> than non-Latinos <b>to</b> report taking action with or on behalf of a friend in a violent relationship. This research shows that adolescents often rely on each other to address relationship violence, underlining the importance of adolescents’ receipt of training and education on how to support their friends, including when to seek help from more formal services. To further understand the valuable role played by adolescent peers of victims, future research should explore both which forms of help are perceived by the victim to be most helpful and which are associated with more positive outcomes...|$|R

2500|$|It is {{imperative}} (for road riding, at least) that the chain is sufficiently tight {{that it is}} impossible for it to derail from either the chainring or sprocket. [...] This generally equates to [...] "no visible slack". [...] A derailed chain can cause a variety of undesirable consequences, such as a locked rear wheel or, worst of all, destruction of the frame if the chain becomes caught around the crank arm and pulls the rear triangle forwards. [...] On a fixed-gear bicycle without hand brakes, even a relatively benign derailment means a total loss of braking ability. [...] Tensioning aside, a chain is <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> derail if the chainline is accurate and the chain is a traditional [...] "full bushing" [...] type with limited lateral flexibility. [...] Because the difference between a tight and a slack chain equates to only very minor elongation of the links, chain tension should be visually checked at least weekly, especially if the bicycle is ridden in wet or dirty conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Gender {{plays an}} {{important}} role in circular migration. In some countries such as Albania, women are <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be migrants, particularly a circular migrant. [...] Traditional gender roles often dictate that these women maintain childcare and household upkeep, while men are expected to be the primary sources of income. That said, there has mostly been an increase in the involvement of women in circular migration, such as through the increase in the number of female international students and those being recruited into high-skill executive and professional jobs. In many areas, though, women remain at the lower end of the labor market. For example, in Indonesia has a large degree of labor market segmentation, as women tend to work in domestic labor, factory work, and the sex industry. Development in parts of the Middle East and Asia has created a demand for domestic workers, and institutions have been developed that recruit, train, send and place these workers. In countries like Indonesia, the number of women seeking to migrate as domestic workers is increasing exponentially despite cultural barriers and stories of exploitation, so the supply exists to meet the demand.|$|E

This study explored determinants of active leisure participation through in-depth interviews with 12 heterosexual mothers of young children who were purposively sampled with contrasting levels of partner support, physical activity, and socioeconomic status. The findings suggested that household norms relating to gender-based time negotiation and ideologies regarding an ethic of care were important determinants of active leisure among women with young children.

2500|$|Stanford University {{professor}} Shelley Correll {{and colleagues}} (2007) sent {{out more than}} 1,200 fictitious résumés to employers in a large Northeastern city, and found that female applicants with children were <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> get hired and if hired would be paid a lower salary than male applicants with children. This {{despite the fact that}} the qualification, workplace performances and other relevant characteristics of the fictitious job applicants were held constant and only their parental status varied. Mothers were penalized on a host of measures, including perceived competence and recommended starting salary. Men were not penalized for, and sometimes benefited from, being a parent. In a subsequent audit study, Correll et al. found that actual employers discriminate against mothers when making evaluations that affect hiring, promotion, and salary decisions, but not against fathers. The researchers review results from other studies and argue that the motherhood role exists in tension with the cultural understandings of the [...] "ideal worker" [...] role and this leads evaluators to expect mothers to be less competent and less committed to their job. Fathers do not experience these types of workplace disadvantages as understandings of what it means to be a good father are not seen as incompatible with understandings of what it means to be a good worker.|$|E

Consistent with the predictions of Hamilton's Rule, we find that outcomes for orphans depend largely on the degree of relatedness of the orphan to the household head. Children living in households headed by non-parental relatives fare systematically worse than those living with parental heads, and those living in households headed by nonrelatives fare worse still. Much of the gap between the schooling of orphans and non-orphans is explained by the greater tendency of orphans to live with more distant relatives or unrelated caregivers. ...|$|R
