5|$|The {{wreckage}} was too severely fragmented {{to determine}} the exact position of the rudders, elevators, flaps, and <b>slats</b> before impact and examination of eyewitness photographs showed only that the right wing <b>slats</b> were fully extended as the crew tried unsuccessfully to correct the steep roll they were in. The left wing <b>slats</b> could not be determined from the blurry color photographs, so they were sent to a laboratory in Palo Alto, California for digital analysis, a process that was pushing the limits of 1970s technology and necessitated large, complicated, and expensive equipment. The photographs were reduced to black-and-white, which {{made it possible to}} distinguish the <b>slats</b> from the wing itself and thus proved that they were retracted. In addition, it was also verified that the tail section of the aircraft was undamaged and the landing gear was down.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping {{over the top of}} the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's leading edge <b>slats</b> in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard <b>slats.</b> As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its <b>slats</b> still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing <b>slats</b> retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of the <b>slats</b> increased the stall speed of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the <b>slats,</b> and the stick shaker on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} for a three-element high-lift system with a half-span flap and both a full- and three-quarter span <b>slat.</b> The simplified wing spanned the wind-tunnel test section with no wing sweep or wing tip. Full- and part-span <b>slat</b> configurations were tested to investigate the three-dimensional effects of a finite-span <b>slat</b> in a landing configuration. With a part-span <b>slat,</b> flow visualization and surface pressures revealed two vortices at the flap tip and one at the <b>slat</b> tip. Compared to the full-span <b>slat</b> case, the part-span <b>slat</b> configuration stalled at a lower angle of attack and yielded reduced lift at all angles of attack. At a representative approach attitude (10 deg), wake surveys indicated comparable induced drag for the full- and part-span <b>slat</b> configurations while the profile drag was more than doubled with a part-span <b>slat.</b> The vorticity contribution of the slat-tip vortex was minimal, suggesting that the vortex dissipates through viscous interaction with the main-element boundary layer.

5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal <b>slats</b> on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the <b>slats</b> locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E
5|$|In development, {{significant}} {{attention was}} given to the Tornado's short-field take-off and landing (STOL) performance. Germany, in particular, encouraged this design aspect. For shorter take-off and landing distances, the Tornado can sweep its wings forwards to the 25-degree position, and deploy its full-span flaps and leading edge <b>slats</b> to allow the aircraft to fly at slower speeds. These features, in combination with the thrust reverser-equipped engines, give the Tornado excellent low-speed handling and landing characteristics.|$|E

40|$|<b>Slat</b> {{noise is}} {{regarded}} as the major noise source of state of the art high lift systems and contributes to the overall aircraft noise signature in particular during the approach phase [1]. Consequently any attempt to reduce high lift system generated noise should first of all target <b>slat</b> noise reduction. Having furthermore in mind that the <b>slat</b> at the same time is a very important means to achieve the necessary high lift performance any approach to reduce <b>slat</b> noise should address the conservation of the aerodynamic performance as well. In the course of this work two different adaptive systems to reduce <b>slat</b> noise will be presented, namely an “adaptive slat” and the “smart droop nose”. The concept of the adaptive <b>slat</b> was investigated in a joint approach between the DLR internal project SLED (Silent Leading Edge Devices) and the EU co-financed project OPENAIR. In the mainframe of the EU co-financed project SADE [2] and again within SLED studies on the smart droop nose were driven. Both approaches have in common that the conventional <b>slat</b> is replaced by an actuated system. The basic difference is in fact that the adaptive <b>slat</b> addresses a <b>slat</b> gap variation in order to reduce or control <b>slat</b> noise while on the other hand the smart droop nose concept represents a 2 -element high lift system without <b>slat</b> aiming at the reduction of the aerodynamic penalty that occurs due to omitting the <b>slat.</b> First studies on the effect of the <b>slat</b> setting and in particular the <b>slat</b> gap size on <b>slat</b> noise were conducted in the DLR project Leiser Flugverkehr [3]. It was demonstrated that a <b>slat</b> gap reduction leads to a local flow velocity decrease at the <b>slat</b> trailing edge and thus resukts in a remarkable <b>slat</b> noise reduction of up to 10 dB, the latter of course depending on the magnitude of <b>slat</b> gap reduction. Based on this first investigation, which was purely acoustically driven, a combined aerodynamic, acoustic and structural mechanic approach was initiated in order to design a <b>slat</b> with active gap size control (Figure 1, left side) that allows on the one hand to reduce <b>slat</b> noise during the approach phase by reducing the <b>slat</b> gap but which can provide on the other hand the full aerodynamic performance by opening the gap to the reference position if needed for instance in an emergency case. The final structural mechanics design concept is based on rigid <b>slat</b> leading and trailing edges which are connected by a somehow flexible material on both the <b>slat</b> suction and pressure side. The movement is invoked by an actuator which acts on the <b>slat</b> pressure side (Figure 1, right side). The feasibility of the design concept was assessed by means of finite element computations which were based on realistic aerodynamic loads on the <b>slat.</b> The acoustic assessment was performed experimentally during a wind tunnel test in the Large Low Speed Facility DNW-LLF of the German-Dutch Wind Tunnel foundation on a large scale high lift system. A rigid and none actuated adaptive <b>slat</b> was mounted at the inboard station of the high lift system in two setting positions. The first one was an intermediate position providing a gap reduction of about 45...|$|R

40|$|<b>Slat</b> noise {{research}} activity within the EC co-financed project OPENAIR involved both experimental and numerical {{studies at the}} new large (1 : 3. 3 -scaled) swept high-lift wing model F 15 LS. Experiments were performed in the DNW-LLF (Large Low-speed Facility) to verify the noise reduction benefit of selected <b>slat</b> noise reduction concepts under more realistic test conditions than in precursor projects. Moreover, the gained test data served to extend current <b>slat</b> noise validation datasets towards larger Reynolds numbers, i. e. up to Re = 5. 1 Mio. in the current experiment. <b>Slat</b> noise reduction concepts under review were 1) <b>slat</b> gap/overlap setting variations, and 2) an adaptive <b>slat</b> {{with the potential to}} reduce the gap width for noise reduction. Both concepts were proven highly e�fficient: Sealing of the gap leads to a maximum 5 -dB noise reduction at wing level, equivalent to a full elimination of the <b>slat</b> noise source. Optimized <b>slat</b> settings or an adaptive <b>slat</b> with partially closed gap are suited to reduce <b>slat</b> noise by about 2 - 3 dB at wing level while producing negligible aerodynamic impact at the operative test angles of attack within the linear polar region. When transposing these results to overall aircraft flight conditions, optimized <b>slat</b> settings might bring about a 0. 5 -EPNdB reduction of approach certification noise levels, provided all other relevant noise sources than the <b>slat</b> remain untreated.

5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended leading edge <b>slats</b> in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system. The NTSB {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing <b>slats</b> to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing. In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.|$|E
5|$|Boeing built a final {{assembly}} line in Washington at its Renton factory, home of 707, 727, and 737 production, to produce the 757. Early in the development program, Boeing, British Airways, and Rolls-Royce unsuccessfully lobbied the British aircraft industry to manufacture 757 wings. Ultimately, {{about half of the}} aircraft's components, including the wings, nose section, and empennage, were produced in-house at Boeing facilities, and the remainder subcontracted to primarily U.S.-based companies. Fairchild Aircraft made the leading edge <b>slats,</b> Grumman supplied the flaps, and Rockwell International produced the main fuselage.

40|$|<b>SLAT</b> (SWAP- 70 -like adaptor protein of T cells) is an adaptor protein {{expressed}} in {{cells of the}} hematopoietic system. <b>SLAT</b> interacts with and alters the function of small GTPase Rac 1 in fibroblasts.

In T cells, <b>SLAT</b> expression regulates the development of T helper cells through Cdc 42 - and Rac 1 -mediated activation of the NF-AT transcription factor. Here we show that <b>SLAT</b> is {{expressed in}} macrophages. Overexpression of <b>SLAT</b> in a macrophage cell line inhibits the IgG Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytic ability of THP 1 cells. In bone marrow-derived macrophages, <b>SLAT</b> protein is recruited to the early phagosomes formed via Fcγ receptor engagement. <b>SLAT</b> recruitment to the phagosome was most efficient when the macrophages express at least one isoform of Rac (Rac 1 or Rac 2), because <b>SLAT</b> recruitment was reduced in macrophages of Rac-deficient mice.

The absence of <b>SLAT</b> is associated with an increase in the amount of F-actin formed around these phagosomes as well as an increase in the amount of Rac 1 protein recruited to the phagosome.

5|$|The {{project was}} {{designed}} {{with a new}} methodology called fault tree analysis, which allowed {{the effects of a}} failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems.

Additionally, some of the most advanced high-lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included <b>slats</b> running almost {{the entire length of the}} wing, as well as complex three-part slotted flaps along the trailing edge of the wing.

5|$|To {{adapt the}} {{original}} Su-27 for naval operations, Sukhoi first incorporated a reinforced structure and undercarriage {{to withstand the}} great stress experienced upon landing, particularly quick descents and non-flare landings (landings where the aircraft does not 'float' and slow its decent rate just prior to touchdown). The leading edge <b>slats,</b> flaperons and other control surfaces are enlarged to provide increased lift and manoeuvrability at low speeds, although the wingspan remains unchanged. The wings feature double-slotted flaps and outboard drooping ailerons; in total, the refinements enlarge the wing area by 10–12%. The wings and stabilators are modified for folding to maximise the number of aircraft the carrier can accommodate and to allow ease of movement on deck. The aircraft is outfitted with more powerful turbofan engines to increase thrust-to-weight ratio, {{as well as an}} in-flight refuelling probe. The Su-33 sports canards that shorten the take-off distance and improve manoeuvrability, but have required reshaping of the leading edge root extensions (LERX).

40|$|The present {{contribution}} {{summarizes the}} <b>slat</b> noise research activity within work package WP 4. 2 (Wing Systems) of the EC co-financed project OPENAIR (Optimisation for low environmental noise impact aircraft) {{conducted by the}} partners Airbus and DLR. It involves both experimental and numerical studies at the large-scale (1 : 3. 3) swept high-lift wing model F 15 -LS. Experiments were performed in the Large Low-speed Facility DNW-LLF • to extend current <b>slat</b> noise validation data bases towards more realistic test conditions than in precursor projects to support the further development of DLR’s numerical <b>slat</b> noise prediction capability and • to verify the documented noise reduction benefit of established <b>slat</b> noise reduction concepts from precursor projects for these extended test conditions. <b>Slat</b> noise reduction concepts that have been revisited and further developed were • optimized <b>slat</b> gap and overlap settings as well as • an adaptive <b>slat</b> concept that actively reduces the gap width to reduce noise under typical approach conditions but restores the original gap width / maximum lift if necessary. OPENAIR <b>slat</b> noise studies build upon {{the outcome of the}} forerunner project TIMPAN, where the noise differences attributed to <b>slat</b> setting variations were numerically predicted and experimentally validated at a fourfold smaller 1 : 13. 2 -scaled 2 D high-lift system (F 16 model). FEM analysis served to specify technically feasible adaptive <b>slat</b> profile bending, accounting for conventional actuator specifications, feasible skin materials and critical aerodynamic loads determined by the flight envelope. Two selected adaptive <b>slat</b> shapes were finally realized as solid model parts that were tested in the DNW-LLF (fully closed gap, intermediate gap width). Main results were: The adaptive <b>slat</b> with closed gap provides a noise reduction of order 5 dB at wing level, equivalent to a full elimination of the <b>slat</b> noise source. Modified <b>slat</b> settings or an adaptive <b>slat</b> with intermediate gap width are suited to reduce <b>slat</b> noise by about 2 ─ 3 dB at wing level while producing negligible aerodynamic impact at the operative test angles of attack. Comparisons of CAA (Computational Aeroacoustics) prediction results with the DNW-LLF measurement data revealed a generally good reproduction of the observed trends with the restriction that measured differences to be resolved were relatively small for most of the tested <b>slat</b> setting variants. Overall, major results from the TIMPAN project were reproduced within OPENAIR. Particularly, the expectation of a relatively broad optimum for aeroacoustically optimized <b>slat</b> settings, as deduced from the former TIMPAN results, is supported by both the measurement and CAA results...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} procedure {{for determining the}} position (horizontal location, vertical location, and deflection) of a leading edge <b>slat</b> that maximizes the lift of multielement airfoils is presented. The structure of the flow field is calculated by iteratively coupling potential flow and boundary layer analysis. This aerodynamic calculation is combined with a constrained function minimization analysis to determine {{the position of a}} leading edge <b>slat</b> so that the suction peak on the nose of the main airfoil is minized. The <b>slat</b> position is constrained by the {{numerical procedure}} to ensure an attached boundary layer on the upper surface of the <b>slat</b> and to ensure negligible interaction between the <b>slat</b> wake and the boundary layer on the upper surface of the main airfoil. The highest angle attack at which this optimized <b>slat</b> position can maintain attached flow on the main airfoil defines the optimum <b>slat</b> position for maximum lift. The design method is demonstrated for an airfoil equipped with a leading-edge <b>slat</b> and a trailing edge, single-slotted flap. The theoretical results are compared with experimental data, obtained in the Ames 40 by 80 Foot Wind Tunnel, to verify experimentally the predicted <b>slat</b> position for maximum lift.

In this study, we have identified a novel alternatively spliced isoform of <b>SLAT,</b> named <b>SLAT</b> 2, which lacks the region encoded by exons 2 – 7 of the Def 6 gene. <b>SLAT</b> 2 was selectively expressed in differentiated Th 2 cells after the second round of in vitro stimulation, but not in differentiated Th 1, Th 17, or regulatory T (Treg) cells.

5|$|After the Falklands War, the UK {{government}} began upgrading the defences of the Falkland Islands {{to guard against}} any further aggression from Argentina. One of the measures taken was the deployment of an interceptor squadron to the islands, with 23 Squadron forming at RAF Stanley in October 1983. At the time, the air defence variant of the Panavia Tornado was still in development, meaning that the Phantom was the UK's primary air defence aircraft (supported by two remaining squadrons of Lightnings). The removal of a squadron of Phantoms to the Falkland Islands left {{a gap in the}} UK's air defences and nothing immediately available to fill it, given that the Tornado was still some years from service. As a result, the UK government decided to purchase another squadron of Phantoms. Because the aircraft in RAF service were a special production batch built to UK specifications, it would not be possible to obtain identical aircraft, so 15 second-hand airframes were procured from among the best of the ex-US Navy F-4Js stored at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona and the Naval Air Rework Facility at NAS North Island. The F-4J was chosen because it was the variant from which the RAF's F-4Ks and F-4Ms were developed, and was thus the closest available to the British aircraft. The 15 that were selected were extensively refurbished and brought to a standard almost equivalent to the F-4S, which was the last variant in service with the US Navy, the only differences being the absence of leading-edge <b>slats</b> and a helmet gun sight.|$|E
5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The uncontained {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and <b>slats,</b> they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E

25|$|Kollam is {{the largest}} pencil slat {{manufacturing}} hub in India. There are more than 150 slat production units in the city employing roughly 5,000 persons. A {{good portion of the}} demand for pencil <b>slats</b> in the country is met by these units. 35% of the world's pencil <b>slats</b> are manufactured in Kerala. Of the 170 odd pencil slat manufacturing units in Kerala, 125 are based in and around Kollam district. These units export 160 loads of <b>slats</b> per month to companies across the world. This, according to slat manufacturers, is enough to make 200 million pencils per month. A slat is of 185mm length, 77mm width and 5.5mm thickness. Each load exported contains 300 bags with 900 <b>slats</b> bundled into each. On an average each month 150 loads of pencil <b>slats</b> are shipped to pencil factories based in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai and various places in Gujarat. Over 30 countries depend on Kollam's pencil slat manufacturers for pencil making under different brand names. These factories are working with the support of their associations: the Kerala <b>Slats</b> Factories Association and the Kerala State Small Industries Association (KSSIA). Most of the important employees of these associations are from Kollam.|$|E
40|$|Aeroacoustic {{evaluations}} of high-lift devices {{have been carried}} out in the Quiet Flow Facility of the NASA Langley Research Center. The present paper deals with detailed flow and acoustic measurements that have been made to understand, and to possibly predict and reduce, the noise from a wing leading edge <b>slat</b> configuration. The acoustic database is obtained by a moveable Small Aperture Directional Array (SADA) of microphones designed to electronically steer to different portions of models under study. The <b>slat</b> is shown to be a uniform distributed noise source. The data was processed such that spectra and directivity were determined with respect to a one-foot span of <b>slat.</b> The spectra are normalized in various fashions to demonstrate <b>slat</b> noise character. In order to equate portions of the spectra to different <b>slat</b> noise components, trailing edge noise predictions using measured <b>slat</b> boundary layer parameters as inputs are compared to the measured <b>slat</b> noise spectra...|$|R
40|$|SummarySWAP- 70 -like adaptor of T cells (<b>SLAT)</b> is a guanine {{nucleotide}} exchange factor for Rho GTPases that regulates {{the development of}} T helper 1 (Th 1) and Th 2 cell inflammatory responses by controlling the Ca 2 +-NFAT signaling pathway. However, the mechanism used by <b>SLAT</b> to regulate these events is unknown. Here, we report that the T cell receptor (TCR) -induced translocation of <b>SLAT</b> to the immunological synapse required Lck-mediated phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues located in an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-like sequence but was independent of the <b>SLAT</b> PH domain. This subcellular relocalization was coupled to, and necessary for, activation of the NFAT pathway. Furthermore, membrane targeting of the <b>SLAT</b> Dbl-homology (catalytic) domain was sufficient to trigger TCR-mediated NFAT activation and Th 1 and Th 2 differentiation in a Cdc 42 -dependent manner. Therefore, tyrosine-phosphorylation-mediated relocalization of <b>SLAT</b> {{to the site of}} antigen recognition is required for <b>SLAT</b> to exert its pivotal role in NFAT-dependent CD 4 + T cell differentiation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{the isolation of}} a protein, SWAP- 70 -like adapter of T cells (<b>SLAT),</b> which is expressed at high levels in thymocytes and differentiated Th 2 cells. <b>SLAT</b> expression was upregulated in differentiating Th 2 cells and downregulated in Th 1 cells. Ectopic <b>SLAT</b> expression exerted positive or negative effects on IL- 4 versus IFNγ induction, respectively. TCR signaling induced translocation of <b>SLAT</b> to the immunological synapse and its association with ZAP- 70 kinase. <b>SLAT</b> reduced the association of ZAP- 70 with TCR-ζ and interfered with ZAP- 70 but not Lck signaling. Consistent with these results, pharmacological inhibition of ZAP- 70 also induced Th 2 skewing. Thus, <b>SLAT</b> is a protein which {{plays a role in}} Th 2 development and/or activation, perhaps by interfering with ZAP- 70 signaling...|$|R
