40|$|Background. Clinical {{outcomes}} {{among patients}} on peritoneal dialysis (PD) {{might not be}} linked to medical factors alone. We studied the clinical impact of various social factors among patients on PD. Methods. In a cohort of 102 consecutive patients who started PD in a single centre between 2003 and 2004, we evaluated the effects of social factors {{on the development of}} peritonitis and risk of hospitalization after initiation of PD. Results. Of 102 incident PD patients, 35 subjects (34. 3 %) were referred to nephrologists more than 3 months before dialysis initiation. During 85. 7 patient-years of observation (median follow-up, 10. 7 months), four subjects died and six underwent kidney transplantation. Patients receiving <b>social</b> secu-rity <b>assistance</b> and those younger than 40 years fared worse than others in terms of their risk of peritonitis. Mean peritonitis-free time for subjects who were on <b>social</b> security <b>assistance</b> was 2. 7 months, and for those who were not, 16. 4 months (P 0. 045). In the Cox proportional hazards analysis, need for <b>social</b> security <b>assistance</b> and illiteracy were the only statis-tically significant factors associated with the time to a first peritonitis, after adjustment for social characteristics and relevant coexisting medical factors. Dependence on <b>social</b> security <b>assistance</b> prior to PD was associated with a> 2 -fold increased likelihood of peritonitis, with an adjusted risk ratio of 2. 69 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 10 to 6. 54; P 0. 029). The total number of hospitalization days was similar between those who received <b>social</b> security <b>assistance</b> and those who did not: 17. 4 ± 14. 6 days (range, 4 – 50 days) vs 17. 9 ± 14. 0 days (range, 0 – 60 days) (P 0. 89). Conclusions. Our results confirm that socioeconomic status is closely associated with the rate of peritonitis among PD patients. The long-term reliability of these social predictors remains to be validated...|$|R

In fact, {{according}} to official data, the higher income strata {{of the population has}} enjoyed the same subsidies as the poor until now. On the other side, subsidies reduction will reduce air pollution by reducing car traffic in Tehran. Finally, the subsidy plan will increase social justice through targeted <b>social</b> <b>assistance.</b> According to official data, the richest decile of households benefits 12 times more from gasoline subsidies than the poorest decile.

5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs.

The Third Social Welfare Amendment Act (1974) brought considerable improvements for the handicapped, those in need of care, and older persons, and a new fund of 100 million marks for disabled children was established.
