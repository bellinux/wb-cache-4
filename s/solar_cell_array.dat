50|$|A {{built-in}} <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> <b>array</b> in {{a hand-held}} product {{has a very}} small capacity. The light output and run time of the solar flashlight are limited {{by the amount of}} energy that can be absorbed in a day. Flashlights are usually stored indoors or otherwise out of direct sunlight; consumers may find it inconvenient to remember to place the flashlight in full sunlight for several hours before use. Rechargeable cells self-discharge, so unless the flashlight is stored in a sunny location, the light may not function in an emergency. Rechargeable cells have a finite charge/discharge cycle life, and when the cells wear out it may be difficult for the consumer to replace them. Some of these disadvatages can be mitigated by separating the <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> <b>array</b> from the flashlight, but then the simplicity of automatic charging is lost.|$|E

More specifically, solar photovoltaic cells have been placed on the reverse osmosis buildings for localised power generation. Each reverse osmosis building has an approximately 100 kW <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> <b>array</b> providing a site capacity of approximately 200 kW at peak sun hours.The high pressure pumps feeding the reverse-osmosis membranes are the largest consumers of energy in the plant.
