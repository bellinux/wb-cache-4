500|$|A {{work unit}} is the protein data {{that the client}} is asked to process. Work units are a {{fraction}} of the simulation between the states in a Markov state model. After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points. [...] This cycle repeats automatically. All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum <b>system</b> <b>requirement</b> for Folding@home is a Pentium3 450MHz CPU with Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as {{a major part of the}} scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.|$|E
