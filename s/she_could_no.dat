5|$|The {{couple had}} three {{children}} together: Eric, Karen, and Mark. In June 1961, daughter Karen {{was diagnosed with a}} malignant tumor of the middle part of her brain stem; X-ray treatment slowed its growth, but her health deteriorated to the point where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer walk or talk. Two-year-old Karen died of pneumonia, related to her weakened health, on January 28, 1962.|$|E
5|$|Maya Lindholm {{was born}} in Hamburg on 20 December 1990. In 2004, she awoke one morning with severe back pain, and within hours <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer move her legs. Doctors {{diagnosed}} spinal cord inflammation. She is studying to be an occupational therapist at the BG Trauma Hospital in Hamburg Boberg. She began playing wheelchair basketball for fun at the hospital in 2005. In 2009, she was selected {{as part of the}} national team.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{favorable}} {{reviews of}} her performances in The Big Knife and Peter Pan, her worsening {{health and the}} failure of her most recent Broadway plays took a toll on her career. As her health declined, she found that her dancing ability was affected. She suffered a severe heart attack in 1955, followed by a possible second attack, and then developed pneumonia which required an extended stay in the hospital. She hid the severity of her health problems, but some details became public. Upon release from the hospital, McCracken was told by her doctors that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer dance. The news was devastating to her.|$|E

5|$|The ballad, The Mermaid of Padstow, tells {{a similar}} story of a local named Tom Yeo, who shot the mermaid mistaking her for a seal. John Betjeman, who was well-acquainted with the area, wrote in 1969 that the mermaid met a local man {{and fell in love}} with him. When <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer bear living without him, she tried to lure him beneath the waves but he escaped by {{shooting}} her. In her rage she threw a handful of sand towards Padstow, around which the sandbank grew. In other versions of the tale, the mermaid sings from the rocks and a youth shoots at her with a crossbow, or a greedy man shoots her with a longbow. Mermaids were believed to sing to their victims so that they can lure adulterers to their death.|$|E
5|$|As Minerve {{turned back}} towards the British convoy with the {{intention}} of cutting off the rearmost ships, Astell passed her more damaged companions to become the first ship in line. This left Windham, now at the rear, to face Minerve alone. Fortunately for Stewart, Minerve lost two topmasts as she turned to face his ship and had to pull away from the British to effect repairs. An hour and a half later, at 18:30, Bellone joined the action, attacking Windham directly. Victor supported Bellone and accompanied the flagship as she moved ahead to attack Ceylon and Astell. By 19:00, with Ceylon damaged so severely that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer effectively sail or fight, third officer Tristam Fleming hauled the ship out of the battle line and ordered his crew to cease firing: Meriton and his second officer Thomas Oldham had both been seriously wounded by grape shot.|$|E
5|$|Sue Hendrickson, amateur paleontologist, {{discovered}} {{the most complete}} (approximately 85%) and the largest Tyrannosaurus fossil skeleton known in the Hell Creek Formation near Faith, South Dakota, on August 12, 1990. This Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed Sue in her honor, was {{the object of a}} legal battle over its ownership. In 1997 this was settled in favor of Maurice Williams, the original land owner. The fossil collection was purchased by the Field Museum of Natural History at auction for $7.6 million, making it the most expensive dinosaur skeleton to date. From 1998 to 1999 Field Museum of Natural History preparators spent over 25,000 man-hours taking the rock off each of the bones. The bones were then shipped off to New Jersey where the mount was made. The finished mount was then taken apart, and along with the bones, shipped back to Chicago for the final assembly. The mounted skeleton opened to the public on May 17, 2000 in the great hall (Stanley Field Hall) at the Field Museum of Natural History. A study of this specimen's fossilized bones showed that Sue reached full size at age 19 and died at age 28, the longest any tyrannosaur is known to have lived. Early speculation that Sue may have died from a bite {{to the back of the}} head was not confirmed. Though subsequent study showed many pathologies in the skeleton, no bite marks were found. Damage to the back of the skull may have been caused by post-mortem trampling. Recent speculation indicates that Sue may have died of starvation after contracting a parasitic infection from eating diseased meat; the resulting infection would have caused inflammation in the throat, ultimately leading Sue to starve because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer swallow food. This hypothesis is substantiated by smooth-edged holes in her skull which are similar to those caused in modern-day birds that contract the same parasite.|$|E

25|$|In 1161, Melisende {{had what}} appears to be a stroke. Her memory was {{severely}} impaired and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer take part in state affairs. Her sisters, the countess of Tripoli and abbess of Bethany, came to nurse her before she died on 11 September 1161. Melisende was buried next to her mother Morphia in the shrine of Our Lady of Josaphat. Melisende, like her mother, bequeathed property to the Orthodox monastery of Saint Sabbas.|$|E
25|$|In the {{engagement}} Crafty lost her fore- and mainyards, which fell over her starboard side. When <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer maneuver, {{one of the}} three Spanish vessels placed a grapnel on her rudder, holding Crafty fast. The other two then came alongside, one on the bow and one on the quarter. Craftys crew was able to repel the first boarding attempt, but had to surrender after the second succeeded in carrying her. In all, Crafty had lost three men killed and 14 wounded.|$|E
25|$|Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is {{the mother}} of Tsarnaev and his brother. In photos of her as a younger woman, she wore western-style clothing. After she arrived in the U.S. from Russia in 2002, she took classes at the Catherine Hinds Institute of Esthetics before {{becoming}} a state-licensed aesthetician and getting a job at a suburban day spa. After deciding <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer work in a business that served men, she started working from home, where clients saw her become more radical and promote 9/11 conspiracy theories.|$|E

25|$|At the Lafayette Theatre, the Anita Bush Stock Company would mount a {{new play}} on a weekly basis. Throughout the Lafayette Players {{lifetime}} with Bush, she {{reached a point where}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer afford the group and sold her right to her “comanager”. Lester Walton. Even though she no longer managed the Players, she is credited with the responsibility of their reputation. As a faithful member she remained with them until 1920. During this year she left the company to pursue a career in motion pictures.|$|E
25|$|In Medieval Europe, a woman's {{parents could}} {{forcibly}} marry {{her to a}} stranger without her consent, and, once she was married, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer refuse to consent to sex: the medieval concept of rape did not allow {{for the possibility of}} being raped by one's husband. In 1563, the Council of Trent expressly declared that legal Catholic marriages had to be done with consent of both parties, but did not require parental consent, essentially declaring forced marriages invalid. This was not universally accepted: for example, in France, women were not granted the right to marry without parental consent until 1793.|$|E
25|$|Bartlett {{ordered the}} {{watertight}} doors closed, sent a distress signal, {{and ordered the}} crew to prepare the lifeboats. An SOS signal was immediately sent out and was received by several other ships in the area, among them were HMS Scourge and HMS Heroic, but Britannic heard nothing in reply; unknown to either Bartlett or the ship's wireless operator, {{the force of the}} first explosion had caused the aerial communication wires slung between the ship's masts to snap. This meant that although the ship could still send out transmissions by wireless, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer receive them.|$|E

25|$|On November 20, 2007, Judge Brinkema {{publicly}} {{stated that}} the US government had provided incorrect information about evidence in the Moussaoui trial and that due to those actions, she was considering ordering a new trial in a related terrorism case, that of Ali al-Timimi, a Virginia Muslim cleric. Brinkema said that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer trust the CIA and other government agencies on how they represent classified evidence in terror cases after Moussaoui case prosecutors admitted that the CIA had assured her that no videotapes or audiotapes existed of interrogations of certain high-profile terrorism detainees, but later, in a letter made public Nov. 13, two such videotapes and one audio tape were made known.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time that Kahlo was gaining {{recognition}} in her home country, her health continued to decline. By the mid-1940s, her back had worsened to the point that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer sit or stand continuously. In June 1945, she traveled to New York for an operation in which a bone graft and a steel support were fused to her spine to straighten it. The difficult operation was a failure. According to Herrera, Kahlo also sabotaged her recovery by not resting as required, and further by once physically re-opening her wounds in a fit of anger. Her paintings from this period, such as Broken Column (1944), Without Hope (1945), Tree of Hope, Stand Fast (1946), and The Wounded Deer (1946), reflect her declining health.|$|E
25|$|Wald wrote short biographical {{stories in}} an attempt to {{overcome}} the traumatic experiences of the concentration camps, and until her death suffered both physically and mentally from the effects of her imprisonment. Along with the memories she could not forget, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer bear to hear music, which reminded her of the Auschwitz orchestra, which had played for incoming transports of prisoners. Succumbing often to depression, she attempted suicide numerous times, and ended up addicted to the drugs given to her for the depression. After being scheduled to testify in the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials, which she wanted to do, her memories became so overpowering to her, she suffered a complete mental breakdown and died in a psychiatric clinic in Ilten, near Hanover at the age of 48.|$|E
