5|$|By mid-2011, Arafiles {{had moved}} his {{practice}} to East Texas and was affiliated with Cozby Germany Hospital in Grand Saline. A hospital administrator there said that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> {{into some of}} the allegations against Arafiles that she found on the Internet but that no one had formally complained to her about the doctor. In November 2011, Arafiles entered a guilty plea on two counts of misuse of official information. Two other charges were dismissed and a pending indictment for aggravated perjury was dropped. Arafiles was forced to surrender his medical license, sentenced to 60 days in jail and five years of probation, and assessed a $5,000 fine.|$|E
25|$|After La Gioconda, Callas had {{no further}} offers, and when Serafin, {{looking for someone}} to sing Isolde, called on her, she told him that she already knew the score, even though <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> at only the first act out of curiosity while at the conservatory. She sight-read the opera's second act for Serafin, who praised her for knowing the role so well, whereupon she {{admitted}} to having bluffed and having sight-read the music. Even more impressed, Serafin immediately cast her in the role. Serafin thereafter served as Callas's mentor and supporter.|$|E
500|$|Hepburn's final {{appearance}} in a theatrically released film, {{and her first}} since Grace Quigley ten years earlier, was Love Affair (1994). At 87 years old, she played a supporting role alongside Annette Bening and Warren Beatty. It was the only film of Hepburn's career, other than the cameo {{appearance in}} Stage Door Canteen, in which she did not play a leading role. Roger Ebert noted {{that it was the}} first time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> frail, but that the [...] "magnificent spirit" [...] was still there and said her scenes [...] "steal the show". The New York Times made similar observations as they reflected on the actress's final big-screen appearance, stating that [...] "if she moved more slowly than before, in demeanor she was as game and modern as she had ever been". Hepburn filmed one final role in the television movie One Christmas (1994), for which she received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination at 87 years old.|$|E

500|$|In November 2009, the New York Post interviewed former Scientologist Mandy Mullen, who {{had joined}} the Manhattan {{organization}} in 2008 after seeing information on 4chan about Chanology protests. Over the next year, she recalled cases of members being coerced into donating more and more money. When she told her [...] "leader" [...] that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> at websites run by anti-Scientology protesters (and disagreed with them), he reportedly replied [...] "That's like saying I don't burn niggers, I just like to party with the KKK!" [...] In Fall 2008 Mullen left the church, joining a group of Chanology protesters across the street. Church of Scientology Manhattan President John Carmichael issued a response the following week, stating [...] "Mandy Mullen's story about Scientology... is all lies {{in the service of}} Anonymous, a hate group that targets our Church, or even anyone who just falls onto their radar." [...] On November 13, 2009, Independent Australian Senator Nick Xenophon used parliamentary privilege to accuse the Church of Scientology of being a criminal organisation.|$|E
500|$|Tenar {{begins to}} {{question}} her beliefs {{when she hears}} Kossil defying the Nameless Ones, and sees {{that they do not}} punish her. She has a conversation with Penthe, her only friend, who expresses an [...] "unfaith" [...] in the divinity of the God-king. Though Tenar reacts to this with shock, the incident opens a new perspective to her. In her own thoughts, [...] "she felt as if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> up and suddenly seen a whole new planet hanging huge and populous right outside the window, an entirely strange world, one in which the gods did not matter." [...] Ged acts as a catalyst for this stream of thought, because he is completely alien to her; he is male, brown-skinned, and has a picture of the world is so different from Tenar's own. After speaking to him, she begins to wonder whether the Nameless Ones, despite their power, deserve her worship, and begins to lose faith in them and in all the things she has been taught. She expects to find only evil in Ged, according to what she has been taught; but instead she finds light and love, further challenging her belief.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 December 2013, {{prominent}} German {{art historian}} Sibylle Ehringhaus, {{who was one}} of the first experts to view the artworks in the spring of 2012, gave an interview in the newspaper Augsburger Allgemeine, demanding the immediate return of the complete collection to Gurlitt. However, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> at the works very briefly and had not researched their provenance because, as she stated in the interview, [...] "Cornelius Gurlitt commissioned neither myself nor anyone else" [...] to perform such research. Chief Prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz vehemently denied her appeal, yet apparently failed to cite any concrete legal grounds for the seizure.|$|E
50|$|Poovey {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{as important in}} the work that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> done in feminist reading. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> at how the growth of women writing was a device for seeing their voices emerge.|$|R
60|$|But if {{that was}} {{the truth of the matter}} <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> and behaved {{differently}} in court--quite differently. <b>She</b> would <b>have</b> been <b>looking</b> for him. <b>She</b> would <b>have</b> seen him....|$|R
50|$|Natasha - 15 {{years of}} age, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> after Polly {{in her first}} week at school {{coaching}} her into how to be popular. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> a troublesome relationship with her father and yearns for his attention.|$|R
60|$|And {{now with}} {{gathering}} and darkening emotion, {{she looked as}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> when Florence entered.|$|E
60|$|Still {{that might}} have been my vanity. She had never said she cared for me {{although}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> it.|$|E

6000|$|... "You may see her; but you'll not {{be struck}} with her being happy. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> as solemn, these three days, as a Cimabue Madonna!" [...] And Mrs. Touchett rang for a servant.|$|R
60|$|Biddy {{turned her}} face {{suddenly}} towards mine, and looked far more attentively at me than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> at the sailing ships.|$|E
60|$|Sally seemed disconcerted by {{her quiet}} ease of manner and perfect candour. It was evidently not quite what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> for.|$|E

6000|$|... "You are kind," [...] she said. [...] "Mother <b>looks</b> {{younger than}} <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> for long and perhaps {{we had better}} accept. But {{it is a big}} {{undertaking}} to drain the marsh. When do you begin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here on our lee-quarter, sir," [...] {{returned}} the seaman {{at the top}} of his voice. [...] "I make her out a ship close-hauled; but, for an hour past, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> more like mist than a vessel." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him quizzically for a moment, as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> at him often since {{he had gone to}} work for Feinheimer.|$|E

60|$|Which made Miss Mohun laugh, {{though her}} heart was heavy, for <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> forward to having a friend and {{companion}} in the young generation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Properly" [...] is a {{thoughtful}} word. No important business can come before it. The By laws have attended to that. No important business goes before any {{one for the}} final word except Mrs. Eddy. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> to that.|$|R
