5000|$|The {{details of}} Vincent Malo’s life are {{relatively}} obscure and confuse. In 1662 the Flemish biographer Cornelis de Bie {{called him the}} [...] "Great Master Vincent Malò" [...] who painted large and small works with a great feeling for flesh tones. De Bie did not <b>specify</b> <b>any</b> <b>dates</b> for Malo. The earliest biographer naming a Vincenzio Malo is Raffaello Soprani in his 1768 publication about artists in Genoa Le vite de' pittori, scultori, ed architetti genovesi. This book is still our primary source of information on Malo.|$|R
2500|$|Persona 5 {{takes place}} within the Persona universe: set in modern times, it {{revolves}} around {{a group of people}} who must face dark forces by harnessing Personas, manifestations of their inner psyche. Rather than <b>any</b> <b>specified</b> <b>date,</b> the game's events begin in the year [...] "20XX". Persona 5 is set in modern-day Tokyo, with navigable locations including Akihabara, Shinjuku and Shibuya, as well as the Greater Tokyo Area. Alongside larger environments, there are specific locations that can be entered such as shops. A major setting in Tokyo is Shujin Academy, which the Protagonist attends. There also exists a parallel realm known as the Metaverse: born from the amalgamated hearts of humans, it holds multiple [...] "Palaces", structures created from individuals' distorted desires. Originally created by the hopes and dreams of people, it has been corrupted by adult authority figures. A location that returns from earlier entries is the Velvet Room, a metaphysical haven for the growth of Persona users that shifts appearance depending on the current guest: in Persona 5, it takes the form of a prison.|$|R
5000|$|For the Bulgarians {{prevailing}} donor {{group in}} admixture {{with up to}} more than 40% are a northeastern group, consistent with the medieval Slav expansion, the date of the admixture event is set at 500-950 CE. The Slavic frequency of the Bulgarians is determined lower than that of Poles and Hungarians, and higher than that of Romanians and Greeks, roughly in between. From data of participating groups, it is inferred that the event of admixture among Bulgarians in the Middle Ages is 46% Belarusian-like, of which most notably Lithuanian-like (23%) and Polish-like (19%), while another 50%+ being Cypriot-like, of which 14% Greek-like. Some of the phenomena that distinguish western and eastern subgroups of the South Slavic people and languages can be explained by two separate migratory streams of different tribal groups of the future South Slavs via both: the west and east of the Carpathian Mountains. By some assumed ancestral populations, about 50% of Bulgarians are in a category [...] "North and East Europe" [...] (right image) similar to the estimate above. It is higher in the West Balkans even among Montenegrins who have only 7% of Haplogroup R1a, which most likely means that the study combines together respective autosomes corresponding to I2a1b and R1a in this category. On the contrary of these estimates is the data for ancestry of 23andme, which separates Northeast European from Southeast European(Balkan) ancestry. In some 23andme examples most South Slavs and Romanians are on average put at over 60% of Balkan source, 10-20% of Northeastern European source, and a further 10% undetermined category [...] "broadly European" [...] that may reduce each frequency. In individuals from all over Romania, who typically plot with Bulgarians and share roughly the same amount of donor groups, Northeast European ancestry may range between several percents and over 45 per sampled individual, while the Balkan is an element with much higher lower and higher bound. The Romanian average per 46 samples of Northeast European ancestry came out 11%, but there is an additional amount of 10% [...] "broadly European", <1% unassigned, which means that Northeast European category may be deflated by a maximum of 10%. Although these estimates are focused on regional sources rather than population sources, none of the two estimates does specifically estimate Slavic or Balto-Slavic admixture or <b>specifies</b> <b>any</b> <b>dates</b> of the regional sources. The Northeastern European percentage from 23andme samples is often by times less than the specified category by DNA.Land [...] "North Slavic". Of the group several sampled Bulgarians by new methodology of DNA.Land the [...] "North Slavic" [...] element averages 25-30%. For comparison, according to the latter data od the [...] "Balkan" [...] element is nonexistent in Belarusians, and most often does not occur in Poles and Ukrainians, but accounts for {{more than a third of}} the total in Croats and Bulgarians. Although their data is highly indicative, both 23andme and DNA.Land have some obvious scarce datasets showing most Cypriots as being of Italian ancestry. The genetic diversity among Bulgarians is the reason of more inherited diseases The blood type of 21,568 Bulgarians is 37% A+ , 28% 0+, 14% B+, 7% AB+, 6+ A-, 4% 0-, 2% B-, 1% AB-, a distribution similar to the Sweden, the Czech Republic and Turkey.|$|R
