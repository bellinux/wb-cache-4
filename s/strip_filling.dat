5000|$|By 2000 The Bash Street Kids was a feature-length <b>strip,</b> <b>filling</b> {{an entire}} Beano book. Often drawn by Mike Pearce and Kev F. Sutherland, {{during the late}} 2000s the strips moved to Beano sister {{publication}} BeanoMAX (where they were drawn by Nigel Parkinson). These feature-length strips were more detailed, delving into an obscure character's personality and introducing new traits. Spotty was revealed as sarcastic and aggressive, while Plug was a more sympathetic, emotional character. The strips detailed a rivalry between {{the kids and the}} comic's cover star, Dennis the Menace. Mike Pearce soon began penciling a spin-off from the original strip, The Bash Street Kids - Singled Out, a single-page comic concentrating on one [...] "kid" [...] a week. Pearce retired, the strips were taken over by Tom Paterson before being mothballed and they were later collected into two annuals.|$|E

Publication was sporadic after 1948, and the last strip was published in 1953. Dalby followed the Book of Mormon chronologically; he started his series in Ether and covered 1 Nephi through 3 Nephi 16. Herald Publishing House, owned by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, also published a pictorial version of the Book of Mormon in 1947. The book by Henry Anderson was called The First Americans and summarized the Book of Mormon.|$|R

25|$|Climate {{is another}} factor that affects {{the success of a}} rumble strips installation. If they are {{installed}} in a northern climate, they may be filled or partially filled with a deicing salt and traction sand mixture. They may also be filled with ice. This is a particular concern in regions with freeze-thaw cycles requiring frequent deicing. Furthermore, <b>strips</b> <b>filled</b> with water, snow, slush, and ice may cause or aggravate occasional accidents. Generally, air turbulence and vibration from passing large trucks keep rumble strips clear of debris and ice, but this process may take several days. Moist traction sand tends to cake together or freezes, and is not easily dislodged by truck traffic. This is problematic on low-volume highways with frequent deicing, and can significantly reduce the effectiveness of rumble strips in winter months.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} ways of {{attaching}} the stainless steel to the aluminium. The oldest is a co-extruded method, where the stainless steel is extruded with the aluminium. This method has suffered, in isolated cases, from de-lamination (where the stainless steel separates from the aluminium); this {{is said to have}} been eliminated in the latest co-extruded rails. A second method is an aluminium core, upon which two stainless steel sections are fitted as a cap and linear welded along the centre line of the rail. Because aluminium has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than steel, the aluminium and steel must be positively locked to provide a good current collection interface. A third method rivets aluminium bus strips to the web of the steel rail. The photo below-right of a Chicago L car's shoe depicts such a rail, showing the aluminum bus <b>strips</b> <b>filling</b> the space below the contact surface of the rail.|$|R
5000|$|Richard F. Outcault's Yellow Kid is {{generally}} credited {{as the first}} American comic strip character. His words initially appeared on his yellow shirt, but word balloons very much like those in use today were added almost immediately, as early as 1896. By {{the start of the}} 20th century, word balloons were ubiquitous, and since that time only a very few comic strips and comic books have relied on captions, notably Hal Foster's Prince Valiant and the early Tarzan comic strip. For many years, word balloons were less common in Europe than in the USA, or were used together with captions. (One example is the Dutch cartoonist Marten Toonder's comics about Tom Puss and Oliver B. Bumble, where the literary captions are printed out below the strip and almost take up as much space as the drawings, so that the <b>strip</b> <b>fills</b> twice the space of most newspaper strips.

From 1921 to 1923 the Government had expended ₤352,790 on the project. [...] However the port company had failed in its attempts to create an inner harbour at Waikokopu, and the Government had to authorise expenditure of a further ₤78,000 for 'the immediate erection of safe berthing facilities'.

40|$|We {{investigate}} stationary spatially localized hexagon {{patterns of}} the two-dimensional (2 D) Swift– Hohenberg equation in the parameter region where the trivial state and regular hexagon patterns are both stable. Using numerical continuation techniques, we trace out the existence regions of fully localized hexagon patches and of planar pulses which consist of a <b>strip</b> <b>filled</b> with hexagons that {{is embedded in the}} trivial state. We find that these patterns exhibit snaking: for each parameter value in the snaking region, an infinite number of patterns exist that are connected in parameter space and whose width increases without bound. Our computations also indicate a relation between the limits of the snaking regions of planar hexagon pulses with different orientations and of the fully localized hexagon patches. To investigate which hexagons among the one-parameter family of hexagons are selected in a hexagon pulse or front, we derive a conserved quantity of the spatial dynamical system that describes planar patterns which are periodic in the transverse direction and use it to calculate the Maxwell curves along which the selected hexagons have the same energy as the trivial state. We find that the Maxwell curve lies within the snaking region, as expected from heuristic arguments...|$|R

50|$|Early Sunday <b>strips</b> usually <b>filled</b> a full {{newspaper}} page, {{but over}} decades they shrank in size, becoming smaller and smaller. Currently, no Sunday strips stand {{alone on a}} page, and some newspapers crowd {{as many as eight}} Sunday strips on a single page. The last full-page Sunday strip was Prince Valiant, which was published as a full page in some newspapers until 1970. Shortly after the full-page Prince Valiant was discontinued, Hal Foster retired from drawing the strip, though he continued to write it for several more years. Manuscript Press published a print of his last Prince Valiant strip in full-page format; this was the last full-page comic strip, though it did not appear in that format in newspapers.|$|R

40|$|Within {{the limits}} of Khinchin ideas [A. Y. Khinchin, Mathematical Foundation of Statistical Mechanics. NY, Ed. Dover, 1949] the {{importance}} of momentum and angular momentum conservation laws was analyzed for two cases: for uniform magnetic field and when magnetic field is absent. The law of momentum conservation {{does not change the}} density of probability distribution in both cases, just as it is assumed in the conventional theory. It is shown that in systems where the kinetic energy depends only on particle momenta canonically conjugated with Cartesian coordinates being their diagonal quadric form,the angular momentum conservation law changes the density of distribution of the system only in case the full angular momentum of a system is not equal to zero. In the gas of charged particles in a uniform magnetic field the density of distribution also varies if the angular momentum is zero [see Dubrovskii I. M., Condensed Matter Physics, 2206, 9, 23]. Two-dimensional gas of charged particles located within a section of an endless <b>strip</b> <b>filled</b> with gas in magnetic field is considered. Under such conditions the angular momentum is not conserved. Directional particle flows take place close to the strip boundaries, and, as a consequence, the phase trajectory of the considered set of particles does not remain within the limited volume of the phase space. In order to apply a statistical thermodynamics method, it was suggested to consider near-boundary trajectories relative to a reference system that moves uniformly. It was shown that if the diameter of an orbit having average thermal energy is much smaller than a strip width, the corrections to thermodynamic functions are small depending on magnetic field. Only the average velocity of near-boundary particles that form near-boundary electric currents creating the paramagnetic moment turn out to be essential...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive technique {{used to produce}} high-quality images of {{the interior of the}} human body. Compared to other imaging modalities, however, MRI requires a relatively long data acquisition time to form an image. Patients often have difficulty staying still during this period. This is problematic as motion produces artifacts in the image. This thesis explores the methods of imaging a moving object using MRI. Testing is performed using simulations, a moving phantom, and human subjects. Several strategies developed to avoid motion artifact problems are presented. Emphasis is placed on techniques that provide motion correction without penalty in terms of acquisition time. The most significant contribution presented is the development and assessment of the 'TRELLIS' pulse sequence and reconstruction algorithm. TRELLIS is a unique approach to motion correction in MRI. Orthogonal overlapping <b>strips</b> <b>fill</b> k-space and phase-encode and frequency-encode directions are alternated such that the frequency-encode direction always runs lengthwise along each strip. The overlap between pairs of orthogonal strips is used for signal averaging and to produce a system of equations that, when solved, quantifies the rotational and translational motion of the object. Acquired data is then corrected using this motion estimation. The advantage of TRELLIS over existing techniques is that k-space is sampled uniformly and all collected data is used for both motion detection and image reconstruction. This thesis presents a number of other contributions: a proposed means of motion correction using parallel imaging; an extension to the phase-correlation method for determining displacement between two objects; a metric to quantify the level of motion artifacts; a moving phantom; a physical version of the ubiquitous Shepp-Logan head phantom; a motion resistant data acquisition technique; and a means of correcting for T 2 blurring artifacts...|$|R

5000|$|Early Sunday <b>strips</b> <b>filled</b> {{an entire}} {{newspaper}} page. Later strips, such as The Phantom and Terry and the Pirates, were usually only half that size, with two strips to a page in full-size newspapers, {{such as the}} New Orleans Times Picayune, or with one strip on a tabloid page, as in the Chicago Sun-Times. [...] When Sunday strips {{began to appear in}} more than one format, it became necessary for the cartoonist to follow a standardized strip layout, which provides newspapers with the greatest flexibility in determining how to print a strip.One notable distinction among Sunday comics supplements was the supplement produced in a comic book-like format, featuring the character The Spirit. These sixteen-page (later 8 page) standalone Sunday supplements of Will Eisner's character were included with newspapers from 1940 through 1952.During World War II, because of paper shortages, the size of Sunday strips began to shrink. After the war, strips continued to get smaller and smaller, to save the expense of printing so many color pages. The last full-page comic strip was the Prince Valiant strip for 11 April 1971. The dimensions of the Sunday comics continued to decrease in recent years, as did the number of pages. Sunday comics sections that were 10 or 12 pages in 1950 dropped to six or four pages by 2005. One of the last large-size Sunday comics in the United States is in the Reading Eagle, which has eight Berliner-size pages and carries 36 comics. It's banner headline is [...] "Biggest Comics Section in the Land". Another big-size comic section is that of The Washington Post which carries 41 strips in eight broadsheet pages although it also contains a sudoku and a Jumble puzzle. Canadian newspaper comic sections are unique not only because of being printed on Saturdays, but these usually are also part of the entertainment or lifestyle section. A notable exception is that of the Winnipeg Free Press which publishes an eight-page comic-only tabloid section.|$|R

In these cell layers shortly after differentiation of Casparian strips, the deposition of suberin occurs between plazmalema and primary cell wall leading to formation of suberin lamellae also serving to block the apoplast.
