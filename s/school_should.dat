5|$|An {{unabridged}} {{edition of}} Anne Frank's work {{was published in}} 1995. This version included Anne's description of her exploration of her own genitalia and her puzzlement regarding sex and childbirth, a passage {{that had previously been}} edited out by Otto Frank. When Gail Horalek of Northville, Michigan, learned in March 2013 that her daughter's seventh-grade class was using this edition of the diary in class, she {{filed a complaint with the}} school district asking that an edited version be used instead. Horalek, who described the passage as pornographic, said the <b>school</b> <b>should</b> have obtained prior approval from parents before assigning the book. In 2010, school officials in Culpeper County, Virginia, stopped assigning the unabridged version after similar complaints were lodged.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, San Diego {{officials}} {{believed that a}} normal <b>school</b> <b>should</b> be established to help the town grow and increase certification of teachers. The tuition and travel for out-of-town normal schools were large and San Diegans desired to have a closer school. San Diego had to compete with Fresno, Los Angeles, and several other cities for a school, and its first attempt to establish one in 1895 was vetoed by California governor James Budd. On March 13, 1897 Governor Budd changed course and signed legislation appropriating $50,000 {{to allow for the}} establishment of a state normal school in San Diego, to be located in University Heights. By 1905, total funds appropriated to the school totaled $333,300.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{the school}} {{received}} a donation of around 250 pieces of ancient, European, Middle Eastern, and Asian {{art from the}} Sponenburgh family. Alumnus Dan Schneider suggested to an art faculty member, Roger Hull, that the <b>school</b> <b>should</b> have a museum to display the university’s art collection in 1992. Then in 1994 Roger Hull made a presentation to the school’s trustees to push {{for the creation of}} an art museum. Over the next two years plans were developed and donations were made that led to the purchase of a building near campus for a museum. One large donation came from Hallie Ford and the Ford Family Foundation that allowed the purchase and remodel to move forward. The museum officially opened in 1998 with over 3,000 pieces of art, and was the second largest art museum in the state at that time.|$|E

5|$|Though {{he would}} later become indelibly {{associated}} with Stoke City, Matthews grew up supporting that club's local rivals Port Vale. His father wanted him to follow in his footsteps and become a boxer, but Stanley decided {{at the age of}} 13 {{that he wanted to be}} a footballer. After a rigorous training session that made Matthews vomit, his mother, Elizabeth, stood firm and made Jack realise that his son, who had one more year at <b>school,</b> <b>should</b> follow his passion of football. His father conceded that should he be picked for England Schoolboys then he could continue his footballing career; around this time his school football master picked Matthews as an outside-right, rather than as his then-preferred position of centre-half. Matthews played for England Schoolboys against Wales in 1929, in front of around 20,000 spectators at Dean Court, Bournemouth.|$|E

25|$|The founders stipulated that: the <b>School</b> <b>should</b> remain small, {{to allow}} for the {{individual}} development of each girl; all girls should be taught the Natural Sciences, as it constitutes excellent intellectual training; there should be more physical exercise and practical work than usual in girls’ schools; no prizes should be awarded, as the pleasure of academic work should be its own reward.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} school, {{which stood}} in St Paul's Churchyard, was destroyed with the Cathedral in the Great Fire of London in 1666. The school was twice rebuilt, first in 1670, {{and again in}} Cheapside in 1822; but {{towards the end of}} the 19th century, as London expanded and residents moved away from the City of London and its environs, it was decided that the <b>school</b> <b>should</b> move to larger premises.|$|E
25|$|Georgia was {{the first}} state-chartered school in the U.S., founded on January 27, 1785. Georgia Tech was founded 100 years later on October 13, 1885. Patrick Hues Mell, the {{president}} of the University of Georgia at that time, was a firm believer that the new <b>school</b> <b>should</b> be located in Athens with UGA's main campus, like the Agricultural and Mechanical School. Despite Mell's arguments, the new school was located near what was then the northern city limits of Atlanta.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} there were no {{premises}} or staff since the committee wished for more time to plan for their own premises and staff. The children were instead sent to an existing boarding school in Shaw Hall, Flixton. However, six years later they moved to Park Place, Ardwick, in the centre of Manchester. By this time {{it had already been}} decided that a new <b>school</b> <b>should</b> be built and the foundation stone of the main building in Cheadle Hulme was laid in 1867. The School moved to its present site two years later.|$|E

25|$|In a vote {{whether to}} replace Seven Locks Elementary School in Potomac {{with a new}} school on Kendale Road, Navarro was in the {{minority}} by voting against the plan. Residents in the neighborhood {{wanted to build a}} new school on the old school's grounds, rather than in a different location. Montgomery County's independent inspector general questioned whether the Board of Education had been upfront about cost projections and community support of the project. The Montgomery County Council voted against building a new school on Kendale Road, deciding that Seven Lock Elementary <b>School</b> <b>should</b> be expanded instead.|$|E
25|$|McQueen's next change {{occurred}} {{in that same}} year, when Lindley Evans was appointed as music teacher. McQueen believed that the teachers appointed to his <b>school</b> <b>should</b> not only have great ability in their chosen field, but also have imagination {{and be prepared to}} be innovators. McQueen saw this in Evans and felt that he could lift the standard of music at the school. This did indeed happen. For many years, P.L.C won the coveted 'Dempster Shield' for choral singing. The school won it so many times in fact, that the shield became the permanent property of the school.|$|E
25|$|The school {{never really}} had a {{permanent}} location until 1905, when a building was erected at the present site of Saint John Paul II High School. In 1930, the building was rebuilt. The building was renovated in 1939, due to the increase of students. Unfortunately, the building was already three stories tall in the 1950s and {{there was very little}} room with which the building could use for expansion. This also was complicated by a lack of room for athletic fields, which included McKeon Field and a football/soccer field. It was decided that a new <b>school</b> <b>should</b> be built using land willed to the town by Enoch Cobb.|$|E

The military police command saw the importance of the investigations division and decided that only high school or higher graduates (at that time, most soldiers had not finished 12 years of high <b>school)</b> <b>should</b> be taken into the division, and their training was conducted by the much more professional Israel Police. Slowly, the investigations division became a professional sector and is now considered the most prestigious sector in the military police.|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 1901 the Governors {{decided that}} the <b>school</b> <b>should</b> become a Science School. Four {{scholarships}} were granted (to three girls and one boy). In July {{it was decided to}} establish a centre for pupil-teachers at the school. In 1902, local education authorities were established and Wiltshire County Council became responsible for education in Chippenham. Latin was omitted from the curriculum. By 1904 there were 101 pupils: 50 from urban and 51 from rural areas. In addition 49 pupil teachers were attending, 9 from urban and the remainder from rural schools, and the evening classes had 139 pupils. From 1905 girls from elementary schools attended Cookery classes at the Cocklebury Road site.|$|E
25|$|Juan Vives (1493–1540) {{proposed}} induction as {{the method}} of study and believed in the direct observation and investigation {{of the study of}} nature. His studies focus of humanistic learning, which opposed scholasticism and was influenced by a variety of sources including philosophy, psychology, politics, religion, and history. He {{was one of the first}} to emphasize that the location of the school is important to learning. He suggested that the <b>school</b> <b>should</b> be located away from disturbing noises; the air quality should be good and there should be plenty of food for the students and teachers. Vives emphasized the importance of understanding individual differences of the students and suggested practice as an important tool for learning.|$|E
