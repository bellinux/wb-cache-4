50|$|In {{the early}} days of mining in the Upper Harz simple open cast working (Schurfe) was the {{predominant}} method of mining. With increasing depth a form of mixed mining developed that was somewhere between open cast and underground mining. These mines were known as glory holes (Pingen) or simply dip mines (Unterwerksbau). The ore deposits that lay immediately on the surface were quickly exhausted and, as early as the 12th and 13th century miners were forced to switch entirely over to underground mining. The mining methods that could be used were limited by the steep, almost vertical, lenticles of ore, which were only a few metres wide, but dipped for several hundred metres into the earth. Hauling shafts were usually positioned in centre of the ore allotment on the lode and followed it into the ground. This resulted in inclined shafts with their characteristic, right-angled, longitudinal sections and frequent changes of angle away from the vertical. There were two reasons for this approach: firstly, it had to be possible to extract ore from the beginning (as soon as the shaft was sunk) {{in order to make the}} pit economic as early as possible. Secondly, the rock in the ore lode, which formed a 'zone of disturbance', was much softer than the surrounding rock. The typical Harz grauwacke was far harder than concrete. As a result, the majority of drainage adits followed the vein. From the <b>shaft,</b> <b>main</b> gangways, the so-called Feldortstrecken, were driven out to the boundary of the mine allotment. From these gangways, miners began to extract the ore, heading downwards into the floor, by 'brushing down' (Nachreißen) in stepped fashion, a technique known as underhand stoping. The stopes had a height of up to 3 metres and followed one another about 5 to 6 metres apart. In longitudinal section, therefore, a pit looked like a Christmas tree standing on its head. The deepest point of the pit was usually the main shaft. This enabled it to collect pit water in the shaft 'sump'. As mining progressed the shaft was sunk deeper.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the characteristics of}} a wind turbine under blade pitch angle and shaft speed sensor faults as well as pitch actuator faults. A land-based NREL 5 MW variable speed pitch reg- ulated wind turbine is considered as a reference. The conventional collective blade pitch angle controller strategy with independent pitch actuators control is used for load reduction. The wind turbine class is IEC-BII. The main purpose is to investigate the severity of end effects on structural loads and responses and consequently identify the high-risk components according to the type and amplitude of fault using a servo-aero-elastic simulation code, HAWC 2. Both transient and steady state effects of faults are studied. Such information is useful for wind turbine fault detection and identification as well as system reliability analysis. Results show the effects of faults on wind turbine power output and responses. Pitch sensor faults mainly affects the vibration of <b>shaft</b> <b>main</b> bearing, while generator power and aerodynamic thrust are not changed significantly, due to independent pitch actuator control of three blades. Shaft speed sensor faults can seriously affect the generator power and aerodynamic thrust. Pitch actuator faults can result in fully pitching of the blade, and consequently rotor stops due to negative aerodynamic torque...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis was {{performed}} at Scania CV AB in Södertälje at the engine development department, NMKA and at Scania Latin America in Sao Paolo, Brazil. Scania {{is a global}} company with operations in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Australia. Scania is the world’s third largest manufacturer for heavy trucks and heavy bus segment. The constant development of new design solutions demands more stable mounting in Scanias production. Assemblies with new screw joints with different parameters affect {{the value of the}} clamping force for the joint and consequently the final product. It is critical that the screw joint has the right clamping force to assure that it fulfils its purpose. Large deviations can result in total loss of clamping force and engine breakdown. The purpose with this master thesis was to find the most important factors that affect the clamping force and form the basis of how different screw joints should be handled. Knowledge about Scania screw joints were collected by working in the production, observing drawings, a thorough literature study and by interviewing representatives from different departments. The problems regarding screw joints were found to be rather different at the departments and the problems had been an issue {{for a longer period of}} time. The mapping of screw joints resulted in a number of interesting screw joints with different kinds of problems. A discussion about the interesting screw joints was held in order to select joints to take a closer look at. By focusing on area of interest, area of responsibility and resources, five screw joints were selected, rocker arm <b>shaft,</b> <b>main</b> bearing cap, connecting rod and the oil sump in both aluminum and steel. The chosen screw joints represented specific types of screw joints on which the chosen parameters were tested. The important parameters that were tested are driver speed, friction and settlement. The equipment that was used throughout the work was the Ultrasonic, which measures the length of a screw with ultrasound. The authors feel that the equipment has given reliable results and that it has been easy and convenient to use during the tests since time consuming strain gages were avoided. The test results shows that the speed of the nut runner has a great influence on the clamping force and torque. Depending on the nut runner and which kind of screw joint that is examined the clamping force and torque varies. The friction affects the result of the tightening substantially, especially when tightening by torque. If torque and angle tightening is used it is an advantage to keep the initial torque as low as possible but high enough to keep the surfaces tight together before applying the angle. The test results regarding settlement show that the settlement is extremely dependent on the ingoing parts in the screw joint. Parameters such as screw and clamped parts affect both the tightening procedure and degree of settlement. The authors recommendations are that a decision has to be made about what information is important for each department. Furthermore, as the tightening procedure is really important for the final clamping force it is advisable to decide which department that is responsible of making the correct tightening parameters of a specific screw joint in the production. Hopefully this master thesis has woken an interest which in the future can make a difference for an even more stable production and in the end an even better quality at Scania CV AB.

40|$|Shaft {{fracture}} at {{an early}} stage of operation is a common problem for a certain type of wind turbine. To determine the cause of shaft failure a series of experimental tests were conducted to evaluate the chemical composition and mechanical properties. A detail analysis involving macroscopic feature and microstructure analysis of the material of the shaft was also performed to have an in depth knowledge of the cause of fracture. The experimental tests and analysis results show that there are no significant differences in the material property of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> when comparing it with the Standard, EN 10083 - 3 : 2006. The results show that stress concentration on the shaft surface close to the critical section of the shaft due to rubbing of the annular ring and coupled with high stress concentration caused by the change of inner diameter of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> are the <b>main</b> reasons that result in fracture of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft.</b> In addition, inhomogeneity of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> micro-structure also accelerates up the fracture process of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft.</b> In addition, the theoretical calculation of equivalent stress {{at the end of the}} shaft was performed, which demonstrate that cracks can easily occur under the action of impact loads.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{research and}} discusses findings dealing with failure modes of gearboxes in wind turbines. These gearboxes fail in general {{after five years}} which is far below the expected design life of twenty years of a wind turbine. The research is taking a more holistic approach towards finding typical behaviour of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> taking the transient nature of the wind into consideration. In this research, a {{small scale wind turbine}} test rig has been designed and manufactured with displacement sensors installed to observe the displacement of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> at specific points, namely the main bearing locations of the forward framework of a wind turbine nacelle, where the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> is installed. The experimental data measured from the test rig is being analysed with common beam bending, statistical and fatigue theories to draw conclusions for long term loading in service. Aspects of the turbulent nature of the wind driving the wind turbine have been taken into consideration as being part of the aerodynamic loading onto the rotor and eventually the gearbox, transmitted through the <b>main</b> <b>shaft.</b> The purpose of the test rig at this stage is to obtain a quantitative insight into the motion of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft.</b> The deliberately chosen softer aluminum material and the more slender geometry for the components should provide exaggerated displacements which help to make motion and deformations more obvious.
