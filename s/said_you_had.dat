500|$|Musically, [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] blends {{pulsating}} {{industrial and}} dance beats with elements of trance. The chorus has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast {{them with the}} hard beats. The song features a dubstep-influenced breakdown, in which Spears moans and blows kisses, and the song ends with a final chorus with elements of rave. The lyrics portray the singer seducing someone on the dancefloor, and the chorus revolves around pick-up lines. After the song was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it for being similar to their 1979 hit [...] "If I <b>Said</b> <b>You</b> <b>Had</b> a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me". They were sued by Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard for defamation and libel, but the case was dismissed after The Bellamy Brothers apologized. McKee stated {{in an interview that}} the title was inspired by a discussion she had with Katy Perry about the latter's body.|$|E

In a statement, David Bellamy said [...] "professionally, well, in all honesty, we feel {{completely}} ripped off. Where's the originality?" [...] The brothers's attorney Christopher E. Schmidt stated that [...] " [...] becomes somewhat uncanny if you simply double {{the beat of the}} Bellamy Brothers' song and match it up with Britney's version" [...] and pointed out that it {{was not the first time}} Martin and Luke were accused of copyright infringement. On March 2, 2011, Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard filed a lawsuit in which they accused the brothers of making defamatory and libelous statements about them. The case was dismissed on August 11, 2011. The Bellamy Brothers released a statement that said, [...] "The Bellamy Brothers apologise to Dr. Luke and Max Martin for the Bellamys' public statements and any false impressions suggested by the statements on their website that Dr. Luke and Max Martin copy the works of others." ...|$|E
