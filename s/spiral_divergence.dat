5000|$|A phugoid or fugoid [...] is an {{aircraft}} motion {{in which the}} vehicle pitches up and climbs, and then pitches down and descends, accompanied by speeding up and slowing down as it goes [...] "downhill" [...] and [...] "uphill". This {{is one of the}} basic flight dynamics modes of {{an aircraft}} (others include short period, dutch roll, and <b>spiral</b> <b>divergence),</b> and a classic example of a negative feedback system.|$|E
5000|$|Daedalus 87 was {{the first}} of the two Daedalus {{airplanes}} constructed, and was flight tested extensively at NASA Dryden Flight Research Center in California. [...] During flight testing, Daedalus 87 was damaged in a crash caused by <b>spiral</b> <b>divergence,</b> with the rudder not able to supply enough control authority to recover from a disturbance-initiated right turn. The aircraft suffered damage to the right wing, fuselage, and propeller. Daedalus 87 was repaired and returned to service to act as a backup airplane to Daedalus 88.|$|E
5000|$|Dutch roll {{is a type}} of {{aircraft}} motion, consisting of an out-of-phase combination of [...] "tail-wagging" [...] and rocking from side to side. This yaw-roll coupling is one of the basic flight dynamic modes (others include phugoid, short period, and <b>spiral</b> <b>divergence).</b> This motion is normally well damped in most light aircraft, though some aircraft with well-damped Dutch roll modes can experience a degradation in damping as airspeed decreases and altitude increases. Dutch roll stability can be artificially increased by the installation of a yaw damper. Wings placed well above the center of gravity, sweepback (swept wings) and dihedral wings tend to increase the roll restoring force, and therefore increase the Dutch roll tendencies; this is why high-winged aircraft often are slightly anhedral, and transport-category swept-wing aircraft are equipped with yaw dampers.|$|E
2500|$|... where n is {{the index}} {{number of the}} floret and c is a {{constant}} scaling factor; the florets thus lie on Fermat's <b>spiral.</b> The <b>divergence</b> angle, approximately 137.51°, is the golden angle, dividing the circle in the golden ratio. [...] Because this ratio is irrational, no floret has a neighbor {{at exactly the same}} angle from the center, so the florets pack efficiently. [...] Because the rational approximations to the golden ratio are of the form F(j):F(j+1), the nearest neighbors of floret number n are those at n±F(j) for some index j, which depends on r, the distance from the center. [...] It is often said that sunflowers and similar arrangements have 55 spirals in one direction and 89 in the other (or some other pair of adjacent Fibonacci numbers), but this is true only of one range of radii, typically the outermost and thus most conspicuous.|$|R
40|$|Dynamical {{systems theory}} {{has been used to}} study the {{nonlinear}} dynamics of the F- 14. An eight degree of freedom model that does not include the control system present in operational F- 14 s has been analyzed. The aerodynamic model, supplied by NASA, includes nonlinearities as functions of the angles of attack and sideslip, the rotation rate, and the elevator deflection. A continuation method has been used to calculate the steady states of the F- 14 as continuous functions of the control surface deflections. Bifurcations of these steady states have been used to predict the onset of wing rock, <b>spiral</b> <b>divergence,</b> and jump phenomena which cause the aircraft to enter a spin. A simple feedback control system was designed to eliminate the wing rock and <b>spiral</b> <b>divergence</b> instabilities. The predictions were verified with numerical simulations...|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of overbanking tendency for a rigid-body, fixed-wing aircraft is investigated. Overbanking tendency {{is defined as}} a spontaneous, unbalanced rolling moment that keeps increasing an airplane’s bank angle in steep turns and must be arrested by opposite aileron action. As stated by the Federal Aviation Administration, the overbanking tendency may lead to a loss of control, especially in instrument meteorological conditions. It was found in this study that the speed differential over wing halves in horizontal turns indeed creates a rolling moment that achieves maximum values for bank angles between 45 and 55 degrees. However, this induced rolling moment may already be a part of other lateral-directional stability derivatives, most probably in dihedral effect. Nevertheless, the overbanking tendency may also be induced by propulsive and/or gyroscopic moments, airplane and flight control rigging problems, human factors, and improper piloting techniques. Straightforward explanation of the overbanking tendency is based on the asymptotic <b>spiral</b> <b>divergence</b> lateral-directional mode, which is very common in many FAR 23 airplane designs. The full nonlinear stability model, which may include coupling of longitudinal, lateral, and directional motion in steep turns at high angles of attack and including propulsive moments, may be required to make the final judgment about the existence of the overbanking tendency. A thorough review of airplane turning performance in horizontal plane is presented...|$|E
40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine the longitudinal- and lateral-stability derivatives of a flat-top wing-body configuration at Mach numbers from 0. 22 to 0. 90 and Reynolds numbers of 3. 5 and 17 million. The wing had a leading-edge sweepback of 78. 9 deg and a cathedral of 45 deg on the outer panels. The tests included {{the determination of the}} effectiveness of elevon and rudder controls and also an investigation of ground effects. The model was tested at angles of attack up to 28 deg and angles of sideslip up to 18 deg. The dynamic response of this configuration has been determined from the wind-tunnel data for a simulated airplane having a wing loading of 17. 7 pounds per square foot. The longitudinal data show a forward shift in aerodynamic center of 10 percent of the mean aerodynamic chord as the lift coefficient is increased above 0. 1. Although flown in the lift range of decreasing stability, the simulated airplane did not encounter pitch-up in maneuvers initiated from steady level flight with zero static margin unless a load factor of 2. 2 was exceeded. This maneuver margin was provided by a large value of pitching moment due to pitching velocity. The number of cycles to damp the Dutch roll mode to half amplitude, the time constants of the roll subsidence and <b>spiral</b> <b>divergence</b> modes, and control effectiveness in roll are computed. The lateral stability is shown to be positive but is marginal in meeting the military specifications for today's aircraft. An analog computer study has been made in five degrees of freedom (constant velocity) which illustrates that the handling characteristics are satisfactory. Several programed rolling maneuvers and coordinated turns also illustrate the handling qualities of the airplane...|$|E

An improved method of aircraft stabilization is described, with {{wind tunnel test}} results and stability criteria, and suggestions for use in aircraft design. The method utilizes {{a new type of}} control surface consisting of a mechanically coupled fin and rudder, which converts the tail surface into an automatic servo control. Theory and wind tunnel tests show that the lift curve slope of the tail, [ [...] . ]	may be increased by six times or more in this way, using reasonable but not extraordinary care with manufacturing methods and tolerances. The dynamic stability criteria are given and compared with wind tunnel tests for nine different balance conditions of two models tested on a swinging arm in the wind tunnel. Four out of the nine cases were stable, and the stability criteria give the correct indication in every case. Stability analysis is used to indicate the effect of coupled surfaces on the lateral and longitudinal notion of a conventional transport airplane. With the regular control surfaces, this airplane has a <b>spiral</b> <b>divergence,</b> "dutch roll," and a poorly damped long-period longitudinal oscillation. With the coupled tail surfaces, having a very moderate increase in static stability over that of the fixed surfaces, all of the above objectionable characteristics are eliminated, and the resulting airplane modes are shown be either aperiodic or damped periodic motion of a very short period. The application of such control surfaces to real airplanes appears to be feasible with little change in the design procedure. Several examples are given of coupled tail designs for different kinds of aircraft. The principle is also shown to be applicable to supersonic vehicles. The economic advantages of airplanes equipped with such stabilizers, together with the success of the analysis and test work to date, suggest that this device is worthy of further development and application to aircraft...|$|E
