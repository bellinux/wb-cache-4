Many cells fired at the sight (and in anticipation) of a single landmark in a viewpoint-or task-dependent manner, simultaneously encoding the animal's logical situation within a set of actions leading to the goal.

Our findings indicate that counterparts of rodent place cells in primates embody multidimensional, task-situated knowledge pertaining to the target of gaze, therein <b>supporting</b> <b>self-awareness</b> in {{the construction of}} space. Author summary In the brain of mammalian species, the hippocampus is a key structure for episodic and spatial memory and is home to neurons coding a selective location in space (" place cells "). These neurons have been mostly investigated in the rat. However, species such as rodents and primates have access to different olfactory and visual information, and it is still unclear how their hippocampal cells compare. By analyzing hippocampal activity of non-human primates (rhesus macaques) while they searched a virtual environment for a reward, we show that space coding is more complex than a mere position or orientation selectivity. Rather, space is represented as a combination of visually derived information and task-related knowledge. Here, we uncover how this multidimensional representation emerges from gazing at the environment at key moments of the animal's exploration of space. We show that neurons are active for precise positions and actions related to the landmarks gazed at by the animals. Neurons were even found to anticipate the appearance of landmarks, sometimes responding to a landmark that was not yet visible. Overall, the place fields of primate hippocampal neurons appear as the projection of a multidimen-sional memory onto physical space...|$|R

Ubiquitous sensing systems {{have the potential to}} sense everyday behaviors and provide the objective feedback necessary for self-regulation of medication taking. We describe an unobtrusive sensing system consisting of a sensor-augmented pillbox and an ambient display that provides near real-time visual feedback about how well medications are being taken. In contrast to other systems that focus on reminding before medication taking, our approach uses feedback after medication taking to allow the individual to develop their own routines through self-regulation. We evaluated this system in the homes of older adults in a 10 -month deployment. Feedback helped improve the consistency of medication-taking behaviors as well as increased ratings of self-efficacy. However, the improved performance did not persist after the feedback display was removed, because individuals had integrated the feedback display into their routines to <b>support</b> their <b>self-awareness,</b> identify mistakes, guide the timing of medication taking, and provide a sense of security that they are taking their medications well. Finally, we reflect on design considerations for feedback systems to support the process of self-regulation of everyday behaviors.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. A. thesis. September 2016. Major: Music Education. Advisor: Michael Silverman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 41 pages. Background: Among continuous improvements in treating cancer {{as a physical}} malady, {{there has been an}} increased focus on the psychological health of cancer patients. Patients undergoing Blood and Marrow Transplantation (BMT) are particularly susceptible to the deterioration of psychological health due to the demanding nature of BMT procedures. Hope is a multidimensional construct that can impact a patient’s psychological well-being. Extant research on hope with cancer patients has promoted psychological interventions to foster and maintain hope, but has been conducted almost exclusively within the field of oncology nursing. Although researchers have identified that music therapy can be effective in the treatment and psychological care of BMT patients, to date there has been no music therapy literature with a specific focus on hope in the psychological care and support of cancer patients. Objective: The purpose of this convergent parallel mixed-methods pilot study was to target hope by adapting an existing hope intervention to music therapy treatment with patients on a BMT unit. Methods: Patients (N = 10) were randomly assigned to experimental or wait-list control conditions and all patients completed the Herth Hope Index supplemented with an 11 -point Likert-Type Pain Scale at pre- and posttest. Experimental participants engaged in a two-session individualized music therapy treatment consisting of patient-preferred live music chosen from a hope-based song menu coupled with therapeutic dialogue that was adapted from the Hope Intervention Program. Experimental participants also participated in an individual semi-structured interview in an attempt to understand their experiences and perceptions of how music therapy may affect hope. The six steps of thematic analysis, as identified by Braun and Clarke (2006), were used to analyze qualitative data. Results: There was no significant between-group difference at pretest. Posttest analyses utilizing Mann-Whitney U tests revealed significant between-group differences in measures of hope with patients in experimental condition demonstrating higher hope. Although not statistically significant, there was a slight tendency for a decrease in pre- to posttest pain for the experimental condition but not for the control condition. Qualitative analyses resulted in three emerging themes: 1. Hope-based music therapy provides opportunities for positive experiences including comfort and interpersonal connection; 2. Hope-based music therapy facilitates personal depth though self-awareness and self-identity; and 3. Hope-based music therapy provides a platform to discuss and confront hope including motivations for and obstacles to hope. Conclusion: Although generalization is limited by a small sample, quantitative results supported hope-based music therapy as an effective intervention with BMT patients in this pilot study. Qualitative data reinforced and provided depth to quantitative results, revealing that hope-based music therapy elicited positive experiences, comfort, and interpersonal connection; acted as a platform to discuss hope; and <b>supported</b> <b>self-awareness</b> and self-identity.

Four scales, two measuring resilience, one measuring coping behaviors, and one measuring perceived administrative support, were used to comprise the SECRS in an attempt to construct a survey with items that would reflect the four domains of the Career Resiliency Framework (i. e. Theme Acceptance, <b>Support</b> for <b>Self-Awareness,</b> Conversion, and Connectedness). Cognitive interviews, expert opinion, and pilot testing were all used during the initial stages of development. The final version of the SECRS was field tested with a sample of 567 continuing and non-continuing special education teachers from suburban and rural school systems. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that an interpretable factor structure could not be derived. Subsequent analysis of each subscale that comprised the SECRS resulted in the derivation of a 2 -factor simple structure for the Theme Acceptance subscale only. Analyses of individual item scores between continuing and non-continuing special educators revealed statistically significant differences in the latent construct of career resilience for two items (TA 2 and SSA 1), and for one item (SSA 17) when disability type was considered.

However, despite the fact that many patients respond well to their biological therapies, there are still a number of nonresponders. In order to design the best care for patients, {{it is important to understand}} how they conceive their own role in their treatment response. Objective: To explore how patients with CIA conceive their own influence on a good treatment response to biological therapy. Methods: This study had an exploratory and descriptive design with a phenomenographic approach. Interviews were conducted with 25 patients (11 women and 14 men) aged 17 – 79  years, with CIA who were undergoing biological therapy and who had low disease activity or were in remission. Results: Patients with CIA undergoing biological therapy conceived their own influence on good treatment response in terms of adherence, physical activity, mental attitude, social <b>support,</b> and <b>self-awareness.</b> Adherence was described as the foundation for the patients’ own influence on good treatment response. Physical activity, mental attitude, and social support reflected three essential ways of understanding patients’ influence on good treatment response where the patients spoke about physical strength, mental strength, and social strength. Self-awareness reflected a comprehensive way of influencing good treatment response in which patients balanced their physical, mental, and social resources in partnership with health care professionals. Conclusion: Patients conceived that they had a responsibility for adhering to the treatment as well as achieving balance in life in order to ensure good treatment response. Self-awareness was essential for maintaining a good treatment response, and this reflected the patients’ awareness of the complexity of living their lives with a chronic illness.

The system employs a new technology called common sense reasoning that enables it to infer affective content from the users' stories and support emotional reflection. This system has been evaluated with seventeen subjects; one group used the G. I. R. L. S. Talk system with emotional reflection support, while the control group used the system without the support. Over three weeks, the group supported with common sense reasoning about emotion increased the variety of emotion words used in their writing; the control group showed no such increase. (cont.) In both cases, the system enabled the subjects to express themselves freely in a comfortable and meaningful way. Overall, this thesis makes three main contributions: 1) new insights into the effects of immediate emotions in academic situations for adolescents, 2) a new system for supporting teenage girls' emotional self-awareness and empathy, and 3) new insight into the value of utilizing constructionist technologies in proactive emotional health systems. by Shaundra Bryant Daily.

40|$|Many {{older adults}} desire to {{maintain}} {{their quality of life}} by living and aging independently in their own homes. However, it is difficult for older adults to notice and track the subtle changes in their own abilities because these abilities can change gradually {{over a long period of}} time. Technology in the form of ubiquitous sensors embedded in objects in the home can play a role in keeping track of the functional abilities of individuals unobtrusively, objectively, and continuously over a long period of time. This work introduces a sensing technique called “task-based embedded assessment” that monitors how well specific tasks important for independence are carried out using everyday objects found in the home with which individuals regularly interact. Following formative studies on the information needs of older adults and their caregivers, a sensing system called “dwellSense” that can monitor, assess, and provide feedback about how well individuals complete tasks, such as taking medications, using the phone, and making coffee, was designed, built, and evaluated. Multiple longterm (over 10 months) field deployments of dwellSense were used to investigate how the data collected from the system could <b>support</b> greater <b>self-awareness</b> of abilities and intentions to improve in task performance. Presenting and reflecting on data from ubiquitous sensing systems such as dwellSense is challenging because it is both highly dimensional as well as large in volume, particularly if it is collected over a long period of time. Thus, this work also investigates the time dimension of reflection and has identified that real-time feedback is particularly useful for supporting behavior change, and longer-term trended feedback is useful for greater awareness of abilities. Traditional forms of assessing the functional abilities of individuals tend to be either biased, lacking ecological validity, infrequent, or expensive to conduct. An automated sensor-based approach for assessment is compared to traditional performance testing by a trained clinician and found to match well with clinician-generated ratings that are objective, frequent, and ecologically valid. The contributions from this thesis not only advance the state of the art for maintaining quality of life and care for older adults, but also provide the foundations for designing personal sensing systems that aim to assess an individual’s abilities and support behaviors through the feedback of objective, timely sensed information...|$|R
40|$|To address {{computationally}} challenging problems, ingenious researchers often {{develop a}} broad variety of heuristics {{with which to}} reason and learn. The integration of such good ideas into a robust, flexible environment presents a variety of difficulties, however. This paper describes how metareasoning that relies upon expertise, bounded rationality, and <b>self-awareness</b> <b>supports</b> a self-adaptive architecture for learning and problem solving. The resultant programs develop considerable skill on problems in three very different domains. They also {{provide insight into the}} strengths and pitfalls of metareasoning. Anthropologists tell us that an expert is one who performs a task better and faster {{than the rest of us}} (D'Andrade, 1991). A programmed expert for challenging problems, however, is unlikely to be given every detail of its reasoning process in advance — rather, it is expected to learn its expertise on its own, to be self-adaptive. Ideally, expertise develops quickly. To accelerate its performance during both learning and testing, a self-adaptive system is likely to be subjected to bounded rationality, that is, to have limits placed on its space and time resources. As a result, computer scientists often construct self-aware programs that observe their own behavior and monitor their own reasoning to improve their performance, as in Figure 1 (Cox and Raja, 2007). The perils of such metareasoning become quickly evident in any ambitious application, however. 1 We believe that easy problems should be solved quickly, and that hard problems should take a bit longer. Rather than rely on thousands of learning experiences, the learners we describe develop considerable expertise after experience with relatively few problems. This paper recounts the challenges posed to one learning and problem-solving ar-Figure 1 : FORR addresses a problem. (Cox and Raja, 2007) ...|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} efforts {{have examined the}} relationships between alcohol use/abuse {{and each of the}} following: (1) causal attributions, (2) private self-awareness, and (3) self-esteem. Reviews such as that by Commins (1984) have noted these relationships, prompting questions regarding the relative contributions of each in explaining alcoholism. In the present study, a model integrating these variables was tested and compared against a comparison set of previously validated variables. In experiment one, male and female college-age students completed questionnaire materials assessing attributional style, private self-awareness, self-esteem, MacAndrew scale performance (1965), and alcohol-related behaviors. In experiment two, male in-patients undergoing 30 -day treatment for alcoholism in a Veterans Administration Hospital completed identical instruments. Within the student sample, regression analyses revealed that daily alcohol consumption could not be accounted for by the three model variables. However, risk for developing alcoholism was explained by the model, with self-esteem and risk positively related. In the alcohol treatment sample, the model was effective in explaining alcohol consumption. Self-esteem demonstrated explanatory strength, with lower self-esteem related to increased daily alcohol intake. In addition, alcoholic risk could be effectively accounted for by the model variables. Both self-enhancing attributional bias and increased private self-awareness were related to risk in this second experiment. Considered together, results of experiments one and two suggest that <b>support</b> for the <b>self-awareness</b> model of alcohol use (Hull, 1981) may vary as a function of how consumption is measured. More work examining alcoholic samples and naturalistic, non-experimental consumption patterns is suggested within this research area. Secondly, future longitudinal research focusing on the relationship between self-esteem and risk for developing alcoholism appears necessary in light of the patterns found. Thirdly, subsequent attributional research in the addictions may benefit from measurement of specific, rather than global causal reasoning styles (i. e., why one smokes vs. how one explains success and failure). Implications for assessment and treatment of alcohol use problems are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Many UK {{midwives}} experience workplace adversity {{resulting from}} a national shortage of midwives, rise in birth rate and increased numbers of women entering pregnancy with complex care needs. Research evidence suggests that workplace pressures, and the emotional demands of the job, may increase midwives’ experience of stress and contribute to low morale, sickness and attrition. Much less is known about midwives who demonstrate resilience {{in the face of}} adversity. Resilience has been investigated in studies of other health and social care workers, but there is a gap in knowledge regarding midwives’ experiences. Objective: To explore clinical midwives’ understanding and experience of professional resilience and to identify the personal, professional and contextual factors considered to contribute to or act as barriers to resilience Design: An exploratory qualitative descriptive study. In Stage One, a closed online professional discussion group was conducted over a one month period. Midwives discussed workplace adversity and their resilient responses to this. In Stage Two, the data were discussed with an Expert Panel with representatives from midwifery workforce and resilience research, in order to enhance data interpretation and refine the concept modelling. Setting: The online discussion group was hosted by the Royal College of Midwives, UK online professional networking hub: ‘Communities’. Participants: Eleven practising midwives with 15 or more years of ‘hands on clinical experience’, and who self-identified as being resilient, took part in the online discussion group. Findings: Thematic analysis of the data identified four themes: challenges to resilience, managing and coping, self-awareness and building resilience. The participants identified ‘critical moments’ in their careers when midwives were especially vulnerable to workplace adversity. Resilience was seen as a learned process which was facilitated by a range of coping strategies, including accessing <b>support</b> and developing <b>self-awareness</b> and protection of self. The participants identified the importance of a strong sense of professional identity for building resilience. Key Conclusions: This study provides important new insights into resilience within UK midwifery, of relevance to the wider profession. Some findings echo those of other resilience studies; however, there are new insights such as the importance of professional identity which may be relevant to other health care workers. Through understanding more about resilience, {{it may be possible to}} facilitate positive adaptation by midwives and ameliorate the effects of workplace adversity. Implications for Practice: This study indicates that resilience is a complex phenomenon, which warrants serious consideration from clinical midwives, managers, educators and researchers...|$|R
