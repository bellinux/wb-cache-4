40|$|Stationary {{planetary}} {{waves in}} the <b>southern</b> <b>stratosphere</b> display a characteristic seasonal cycle. Previous research based on a one-dimensional model suggests that this behavior is mainly determined by seasonally varying transmission properties of the atmosphere with respect to wave propagation. The issue is investigated {{with the help of}} a hemispheric, linear, quasigeostrophic model. It reproduces well some of the observed qualitative features and is internally consistent in the sense that its seasonal wave cycle can be explained in terms of varying wave transmission properties of the mean circulation. On the other hand, the model does not yield the observed seasonal cycle. Despite considerable sensitivity to modifications in the basic state wind and dissipation parametrization, the model could not be reasonably fit to reproduce the observed seasonal cycle...|$|E
40|$|The stratospheric {{circulation}} and planetary-scale dusturbances during early-winter (mid-April to mid-July) in the Southern Hemisphere are investigated using observational data collected for the 1979 - 1990 period, and a 3 D primitive equation {{model of the}} stratosphere and mesosphere. It was {{found that there were}} six extended periods in the data set when wave 1 (which is usually quasi-stationary) traveled steadily eastward and had large amplitude. Results of simulations suggest that the development of the South Pacific warmings is connected with the amplification of wave 1 at 100 mb.

40|$|An {{emission}} feature at 220 cm- 1 {{which has}} been attributed to a cloud of condensed material in Titan's winter stratosphere has been seen {{for the first time in}} the south. This feature had previously been found only at high northern latitudes during northern winter and spring. The material emitting at 220 cm- 1, as yet unidentified, may be volatiles associated with nitrile gases that accumulate in the absence of ultraviolet sunlight. Not detected as recently as 2012 February, the 220 cm- 1 feature clearly appeared at the south pole in Cassini spectra recorded on 2012 July 24, indicating a rapid onset of the emission. This is the first indication of the winter buildup of condensation in the <b>southern</b> <b>stratosphere</b> that has been expected as the south pole moves deeper into shadow.

40|$|Using {{satellite}} observations, reanalysis data, {{and model}} simulations, this study investigates {{the effect of}} sea surface temperature (SST) on interannual variations of lower-stratospheric ozone at southern high latitudes in austral spring. It is found that the SST variations across the East Asian marginal seas (5 ° S– 35 ° N, 100 – 140 ° E) rather than the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, where ENSO occurs, have the most significant correlation with the southern high-latitude lower-stratospheric ozone changes in austral spring. Further analysis reveals that planetary waves originating over the marginal seas in austral spring can propagate towards southern middle to high latitudes via teleconnection pathway. The anomalous propagation and dissipation of ultra-long Rossby waves in the stratosphere strengthen/cool (weaken/warm) the southern polar vortex, which produces more (less) active chlorine and enhances (suppresses) ozone depletion in the <b>southern</b> high-latitude <b>stratosphere</b> on one the hand and impedes (favors) the transport of ozone from the <b>southern</b> middle-latitude <b>stratosphere</b> to high latitudes on the other.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that the atmosphere is chaotic by nature and thus has a finite limit of predictability. The chaotic divergence of initial conditions and the predictability are explored here {{in the context of}} the whole atmosphere (from the ground to the thermosphere) using the NCAR Whole Atmo-sphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). From ensemble WACCM simulations, it is found that the early growth of differences in initial conditions is associated with gravity waves and it becomes apparent first in the upper atmosphere and progresses downward. The differences later become more profound on increasingly larger scales, and the growth rates of the differences change in various atmospheric regions and with seasons—corresponding closely with the strength of planetary waves. For example, in December– February the growth rates are largest in the northern and southern mesosphere and lower thermosphere and in the northern stratosphere, while smallest in the <b>southern</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> The growth rates, on the other hand, are not sensitive to the altitude where the small differences are introduced in the initial conditions or the physical nature of the differences. Furthermore, the growth rates in the middle and upper atmosphere are significantly reduced if the lower atmosphere is regularly reinitialized, and the reduction depends on the frequency and the altitude range of the reinitialization. 1...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{state-of-the-art}} chemistry-climate model, we analyzed the atmospheric responses {{to increases in}} sea surface temperature (SST). The results showed that increases in SST and the SST meridional gradient could intensify the subtropical westerly jets and significantly weaken the northern polar vortex. In the model runs, global uniform SST increases produced a more {{significant impact on the}} <b>southern</b> <b>stratosphere</b> than the northern stratosphere, while SST gradient increases produced a more significant impact on the northern stratosphere. The asymmetric responses of the northern and southern polar stratosphere to SST meridional gradient changes were found to be mainly due to different wave properties and transmissions in the northern and southern atmosphere. Although SST increases may give rise to stronger waves, the results showed that the effect of SST increases on the vertical propagation of tropospheric waves into the stratosphere will vary with height and latitude and be sensitive to SST meridional gradient changes. Both uniform and non-uniform SST increases accelerated the large-scale Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC), but the gradient increases of SST between 60 °S and 60 °N resulted in younger mean age-of-air in the stratosphere and a larger increase in tropical upwelling, with a much higher tropopause than from a global uniform 1. 0 K SST increase. © 2014 Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of black carbon (soot) aerosol (BCA) {{in the atmosphere}} is of interest for several reasons: (1) Because BCA has the highest absorption cross section of any compound known, it can absorb solar radiation to cause atmospheric warming. (2) Because it is a strong adsorber of gases, it can catalyze heterogeneous reactions to change the chemical composition of the atmosphere. (3) If aircraft are {{a major source of}} BCA, it is an important tracer of aircraft emissions. Analysis for BCA of impactor samples from Arctic and Antarctic deployments, utilizing particle morphology of scanning electron microscopy images, permits the following conclusions: (1) The BCA concentration in the northern stratosphere varies between 0 and 2. 6 ng m- 3 averaging 0. 6 ng/cu m. (2) This BCA loading is commensurate with estimated fuel consumptions in the stratosphere by the current commercial fleet and an emission index E= 0. 03 g BCA per kg fuel burnt which was measured in jet exhaust at al titude. Thus, most stratospheric BCA in the northern stratosphere results from aircraft emissions. The background BCA concentration in the <b>southern</b> <b>stratosphere</b> varies between 0 and 0. 6 ng cu m averaging 0. 1 ng/cu m. This strong meridional gradient implies that stratospheric BCA residence time- is shorter than are mixing times between hemispheres. Projected annual fuel consumption of a future supersonic commercial fleet is 7 E 13 g. This fleet would increase stratospheric BCA loadings by a factor of 2 - 3, because almost all fuel would be burnt above the tropopause. An improved EI(BCA) by a factor of ten would result in an increase of stratospheric BCA loadings by approximately 50 %...|$|E

Our focus is on constructing a simple kinematic model that retains the fundamental mechanisms responsible for complex fluid parcel evolution, during the polar vortex breakdown and its previous stages. The construction of the kinematic model is guided by the Fourier decomposition of the geopotential field. The study of Lagrangian transport phenomena in the ERA-Interim reanalysis data highlights hyperbolic trajectories, and these trajectories are Lagrangian objects that are the kinematic mechanism for the observed filamentation phenomena. Our analysis shows that the breaking and splitting of the polar vortex is justified in our model by the sudden growth of a planetary wave and the decay of the axisymmetric flow...|$|R
40|$|Nearly all general {{circulation}} models significantly fail {{to reproduce the}} observed behaviour of the southern wintertime polar vortex. It {{has been suggested that}} these biases result from an underestimation of gravity wave drag on the atmosphere at latitudes near 60 ° S, especially around the "hot spot" of intense gravity wave fluxes above the mountainous Southern Andes and Antarctic peninsula. Here, we use Global Positioning System radio occultation (GPS-RO) data from the COSMIC satellite constellation to determine the properties of gravity waves in the hot spot and beyond. We show considerable southward propagation to latitudes near 60 ° S of waves apparently generated over the southern Andes. We propose that this propagation may account for much of the wave drag missing from the models. Furthermore, there is a long leeward region of increased gravity wave energy that sweeps eastwards from the mountains over the Southern Ocean. Despite its striking nature, the source of this region has historically proved difficult to determine. Our observations suggest that this region includes both waves generated locally and orographic waves advected downwind from the hot spot. We describe and use a new wavelet-based analysis technique for the quantitative identification of individual waves from COSMIC temperature profiles. This analysis reveals different geographical regimes of wave amplitude and short-timescale variability in the wave field over the Southern Ocean. Finally, we use the increased numbers of closely spaced pairs of profiles from the deployment phase of the COSMIC constellation in 2006 to make estimates of gravity wave horizontal wavelengths. We show that, given sufficient observations, GPS-RO can produce physically reasonable estimates of stratospheric gravity wave momentum flux in the hot spot that are consistent with measurements made by other techniques. We discuss our results in the context of previous satellite and modelling studies and explain how they advance our understanding of the nature and origins of waves in the <b>southern</b> <b>stratosphere...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe analyze spectra {{acquired}} by the Cassini/Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) at high resolution from October 2010 until September 2014 in nadir mode. Up until mid 2012, Titan’s Northern atmosphere exhibited the enriched chemical content found since the Voyager days (November 1980), with a peak around the Northern Spring Equinox (NSE) in 2009. Since then, we have observed the appearance at Titan’s south pole of several trace species for the first time, such as HC 3 N and C 6 H 6, observed only at high northern latitudes before equinox. We investigate here latitudes poleward of 50 °S and 50 °N from 2010 (after the Southern Autumnal Equinox) until 2014. For {{some of the most}} abundant and longest-lived hydrocarbons (C 2 H 2, C 2 H 6 and C 3 H 8) and CO 2, the evolution in the past 4 years at a given latitude is not very significant within error bars especially until mid- 2013. In more recent dates, these molecules show a trend for increase in the south. This trend is dramatically more pronounced for the other trace species, especially in 2013 – 2014, and at 70 °S relative to 50 °S. These two regions then demonstrate that they are subject to different dynamical processes {{in and out of the}} polar vortex region. For most species, we find higher abundances at 50 °N compared to 50 °S, with the exception of C 3 H 8, CO 2, C 6 H 6 and HC 3 N, which arrive at similar mixing ratios after mid- 2013. While the 70 °N data show generally no change with a trend rather to a small decrease for most species within 2014, the 70 °S results indicate a strong enhancement in trace stratospheric gases after 2012. The 663 cm− 1 HC 3 N and the C 6 H 6 674 cm− 1 emission bands appeared in late 2011 /early 2012 in the south polar regions and have since then exhibited a dramatic increase in their abundances. At 70 °S HC 3 N, HCN and C 6 H 6 have increased by 3 orders of magnitude over the past 3 – 4 years while other molecules, including C 2 H 4, C 3 H 4 and C 4 H 2, have increased less sharply (by 1 – 2 orders of magnitude). This is a strong indication of the rapid and sudden buildup of the gaseous inventory in the <b>southern</b> <b>stratosphere</b> during 2013 – 2014, as expected as the pole moves deeper into winter shadow.

40|$|The age of {{stratospheric air}} is {{calculated}} over 22 yr of the ERA-Interim reanalysis using an off-line Lagrangian transport model and heating rates. At low and mid-latitudes, {{the mean age}} of air is in good agreement with observed ages from aircraft flights, high altitude balloons and satellite observations of CO 2 and SF 6 . The mid-latitude age spectrum in the lower stratosphere exhibits a long tail with a peak at 0. 5 yr, which is maximum {{at the end of the}} winter, and a secondary flat maximum between 4 and 5 yr due to the combination of fast and slow branches of the Brewer-Dobson circulation and the reinforced barrier effect of the jet. At higher altitudes, the age spectrum exhibits the footprint of the annual modulation of the deep Brewer-Dobson circulation. The variability of the mean age is analysed through a decomposition in terms of annual cycle, QBO, ENSO and trend. The annual modulation is the dominating signal in the lower stratosphere and in the tropical pipe with amplitude up to one year. The phase of the oscillation is opposite in both hemisphere beyond 20 &deg; and is also reversed below and above 25 km with maximun arising in mid-March in the Northern Hemisphere and in mid-September in the Southern Hemisphere. The tropical pipe signal is in phase with the lower <b>southern</b> <b>stratosphere</b> and the mid northern stratosphere. The maximum amplitude of the QBO modulation is of about 0. 5 yr and is mostly concentrated within the tropics between 25 and 35 km. It lags the QBO wind at 30 hPa by about 8 months. The ENSO signal is small and limited to the lower northen stratosphere. The trend is significant and negative, of the order of − 0. 3 to − 0. 5 yr dec&minus; 1 , within the lower stratosphere in the Southern Hemisphere and under 40 &deg; N in the Northern Hemisphere below 25 km. It is positive (of the order of 0. 3 yr dec&minus; 1 ) in the mid stratosphere but there is no region of consistent significance. This suggests that the shallow and deep Brewer-Dobson circulations may evolve in opposite directions. It is however difficult to estimate a reliable long-term trend from only 22 yr of data. For instance, a positive trend is found in the lower stratosphere if only the second half of the period is considered in agreement with MIPAS SF 6 data excepted in the northern polar region and at high altitude. Finally, it is found that the long lasting influence of the Pinatubo eruption can be seen on the age of air from June 1991 until the end of 1993 and can bias the statistics encompassing this period. In our analysis, this eruption shifts the trend towards negative values by about 0. 2 to 0. 3 yr dec&minus; 1 ...|$|E
40|$|A Search for Free Rossby Waves and for van Loon's Temperature Variations in the <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere <b>Stratosphere.</b> by Roland A. Madden, NCAR Thirty years ago, Harry van Loon {{published}} a paper describing out-of-phase temperature variations at {{middle and high}} latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere stratosphere (van Loon teal. 1975). They are a regular feature there, and their typical time scale is one to three weeks. It {{has been argued that}} at least some of these variations can be explained by similar variations in horizontal heat transport from middle to high latitudes which result from the interference of forced, stationary waves and free, traveling Rossby waves (Madden and Labitzke, 1981). If this interpretation is correct, one might expect similar variations in the <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere <b>stratosphere</b> since the free Rossby waves are global modes. Variations are smaller in the Southern Hemisphere(Randel and Newman, 1998), but large oscillations in temperature gradient and eddy heat transport do occur occasionally, and good examples are those during the southern winter of 2002 (J. Atmos. Sci., March 2005). Those particular oscillations have been connected to the interaction between a stationary wave- 1 and an eastward traveling wave- 2. Free Rossby waves of large scale such as wave- 2 should move westward so this latter wave is not a free Rossby wave. Indeed the predominant propagation of large-scale waves in the <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere <b>stratosphere</b> is eastward (e. g. Randel and Newman, 1998), although there is some evidence based on Southern Hemisphere data alone (as opposed to projections of global data) for westward propagating free Rossby waves (e. g. Rodgers, 1976; Mechoso and Hartmann, 1982; Hirota and Hirooka, 1984). To learn if the interference of forced, stationary waves and free, traveling Rossby waves as proposed for Northern Hemisphere oscillations may play a role in some Southern Hemisphere stratospheric ones, we search for a Southern Hemisphere manifestation of the waves and for resulting temperature variations of the van Loon type.

40|$|An {{analysis}} was done of intense midwinter warmings {{which took place}} in the <b>southern</b> hemisphere <b>stratosphere</b> during August-September 1988. By using the southern hemispheric data set up to the 1 mb level provided by Japan Meteorological Agency, it is found that the 30 mb temperature increase over eastern Antarctica, about 60 K for 10 days from August 22 to September 1,is associated with the amplification of a quasi-stationary planetary wave of zonal wavenumber 1. The enhancement of wave 1 appears quasi-periodically with a times scale of about 2 weeks during the mid-winter of 1988. Clear evidence is presented to show that the quasi-periodic amplification of wave 1 is due to the wave-wave interaction between the quasi-stationary forced wave of wavenumber 1 and the eastward traveling wave of wavenumber 2.

40|$|A middle {{atmosphere}} temperature benchmark in the polar region {{is critical to}} monitoring the climate change. However, it is very challenging to establish such a benchmark because {{it is difficult to}} observe temperatures in the polar region and numerous factors affect the temperature variations. Ground-base lidars are capable of providing high-resolution and long-duration measurements of temperatures in the polar region, which is critical in advancing our understanding of the {{middle atmosphere}} thermal structures and dynamics. In this study, the lidar temperature morphology is formed at Rothera (67. 5 ºS, 68 ºW) and South Pole using the lidar observations from 1999 to 2005. Teleconnection (inter-hemispheric coupling) is one of the new mechanisms causing, e. g., the temperature variations in the southern polar middle and upper atmosphere by regions not physically attached, e. g., the northern polar stratosphere. We study it by deriving the teleconnection patterns over the global latitudes and from the stratosphere to lower thermosphere using 8 -year temperature observations of SABER and 54 -year temperature and wind simulations of WACCM. A main new finding is that the teleconnection extends well into the lower thermosphere, the thermospheric anomalies are consistent with the corresponding changes of the winter-to-summer lower-thermospheric branch of the residual circulation, and the winter stratosphere perturbations influence the stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere globally. Cold pole bias is a long-standing problem in most general circulation and chemistry climate models, referring to the simulated <b>southern</b> winter <b>stratosphere</b> is significantly colder than observations.

40|$|This {{study is}} the first to {{identify}} a robust El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal in the Antarctic stratosphere. El Nino events are classified as either conventional "cold tongue" events (positive SST anomalies in the Nino 3 region) or "warm pool" events (positive SST anomalies in the Nino 4 region). The ERA- 40, NCEP and MERRA meteorological reanalyses are used to show that the <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere <b>stratosphere</b> responds differently to these two types of El Nino events. Consistent with previous studies, "cold tongue" events do not impact temperatures in the Antarctic stratosphere. During "warm pool" El Nino events, the poleward extension and increased strength of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) favor an enhancement of planetary wave activity during the SON season. On average, these conditions lead to higher polar stratospheric temperatures and a weakening of the Antarctic polar jet in November and December, as compared with neutral ENSO years.

40|$|Chemistry–climate {{models are}} {{important}} tools for addressing interactions of composition and climate in the Earth system. In particular, {{they are used}} to assess the combined roles of greenhouse gases and ozone in Southern Hemisphere climate and weather. Here we present an evaluation of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator – chemistry–climate model (ACCESS-CCM), focusing on the Southern Hemisphere and the Australian region. This model is used for the Australian contribution to the international Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative, which is soliciting hindcast, future projection and sensitivity simulations. The model simulates global total column ozone (TCO) distributions accurately, with a slight delay in the onset and recovery of springtime Antarctic ozone depletion, and consistently higher ozone values. However, October-averaged Antarctic TCO from 1960 to 2010 shows a similar amount of depletion compared to observations. Comparison with model precursors shows large improvements in the representation of the <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere <b>stratosphere,</b> especially in TCO concentrations. A significant innovation is seen in the evaluation of simulated vertical profiles of ozone and temperature with ozonesonde data from Australia, New Zealand and Antarctica from 38 to 90 ° S. Excess ozone concentrations (greater than 26...|$|R
40|$|Disturbances in {{the middle}} {{atmosphere}} are often interpreted {{in the framework of}} waves superimposed on a zonal-mean flow. This paper presents an analysis of travelling waves in the northern hemisphere stratosphere, concentrating on planetary wavenumber two (W 2). Space-time spectral analysis reveals the existence of a substantial eastward-travelling planetary W 2 at high latitudes in winter. While a similar feature is well documented in the <b>southern</b> hemisphere <b>stratosphere,</b> where it is observed in most winters, this northern hemisphere counterpart is less common and has not been examined in detail. A climatology of occurrence of the wave is given for the northern stratospheric winter. It is denoted as the quasi- 16 -day eastward travelling W 2, because of its dominant periodicity, which ranges from about one to three weeks. Although the wave has some similarities with the southern hemispheric wave, there is much larger interannual and intraseasonal variability in the northern hemisphere. will emphasize the variations in the spatial and temporal structure of this wave, as isolated in meteorological analyses of radiosonde and satellite data. The possible role of these travelling waves in preconditioning the stratosphere as a precursor to sudden stratospheric warmings in both hemispheres will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study aims at {{understanding}} the {{spatial and temporal}} variability of HNO 3 total columns in terms of explanatory variables. To achieve this, multiple linear regressions are used to ﬁt satellite-derived time series of HNO 3 daily averaged total columns. First, {{an analysis of the}} IASI 9 -year time series (2008 – 2016) is conducted based on various equivalent latitude bands. The strong and systematic denitriﬁcation of the <b>southern</b> polar <b>stratosphere</b> is observed very clearly. It is also possible to distinguish, within the polar vortex, three regions wich are differently affected by the denitriﬁcation. Three exceptional denitriﬁcation episodes in 2011, 2014 and 2016 are also observed in the northern hemisphere, due to unusually low arctic temperatures. The time series are then ﬁtted by multivariate regressions to identify what variables are responsible for HNO 3 variability in global distributions and time series, and to quantify their respective inﬂuence. Out of an ensemble of proxies (annual cycle, solar ﬂux, quasi-biennial oscillation, multivariate ENSO index, Arctic and Antarctic oscillations and volume of polar stratospheric clouds), only the ones deﬁned as signiﬁcant (p-value[*] 3 variability that remains unexplained by the model, especially in the intertropical regions, where factors not included in the regression model (such as vegetation ﬁres or lightning) may be at play...|$|R
40|$|This {{project called}} Electrodynamics of the Middle Atmosphere (EMA) : Superpressure Balloon Program was begun by the PI at the Aerospace Corporation in Los Angeles under joint NSF and NASA funding {{originally}} combined in one grant ATM 80 - 17071 and has continued at the University of Washington under grants ATM 8212283, ATM 84 - 11326 and ATM 86 - 15628 and NASA grants NAGW- 724 and NAGS- 635. In the EMA experiment a comprehensive set of electrical parameters was measured during eight long-duration balloon flights in the <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere <b>stratosphere.</b> These flights {{resulted in the}} largest vector electric field data set ever collected from the stratosphere {{which has been a}} treasure-trove of new phenomena. Since the stratosphere has never been electrodynamically sampled in this systematic manner before, it is perhaps not surprising that several new discoveries have been made and reported. Another way to measure the success of this first EMA project is to note that all together the total data rate was about 1 bit/sec/payload amounting to 12 MBytes (1 / 3 of 1 standard 1600 BPI magnetic tape) which nevertheless has resulted in 14 papers and 2 masters theses (so far!. Ten of these papers and one masters thesis specifically acknowledge the support by NASA grant NAGS- 635 are discussed herein...|$|R
40|$|Dynamical {{features}} of the interannual variations of the seasonal march in the <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere <b>stratosphere</b> are investigated with the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis dataset from 1979 to 2002, and the unprec-edented year 2002, in which a major stratosphere sudden warming occurred, is characterized by comparing it with the other 23 yr. A multiple empirical orthogonal function analysis of the stratospheric mean zonal wind and a composite analysis based on the principal component of the leading mode show that the interannual variations are characterized by early or late deceleration of the polar-night jet, which is well correlated with the variation of a time-averaged upward Eliassen–Palm (EP) flux in the lower stratosphere. The stronger wave activity in the lower stratosphere {{is associated with the}} earlier “shift down ” of the jet. The composite difference of the stratospheric mean zonal wind can be traced down to the lower troposphere in September and October. These features are consistent with the variations of the Southern Hemisphere annular mode, although the main disturbance to maintain the variations is different between the stratosphere and troposphere. Some scatter diagrams show the extreme situation of the year 2002. It is far from the cluster of the other 23 yr, but the large deviation in 2002 is consistent with the tendency of the fluctuations in the other years except for its extreme nature. 1...|$|R
40|$|Horizontal {{wind and}} {{temperature}} data are employed {{to investigate the}} dynamics of the 4 -day wave in the <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere polar <b>stratosphere.</b> They were derived from synoptic maps of satellite-measured brightness temperatures, which were generated using the fast Fourier synoptic mapping technique of Salby (1982). Circulation statistics from these data are compared to those from the NMC operational stratospheric analyses, demonstrating improvements afforded by detailed treatment of asynoptic sampling effects. The 40 -day wave is isolated using temporally filtered data. Several events of wave growth and decay are observed in the upper stratosphere during August 1980. Derived zonal-mean and eddy statistics suggest that the 4 -day wave results from an instability of the zonal-mean flow near 55 - 60 S, at and above 1 mb. It is inferred from climatological data that the source of the instability is the 'double-jet' structure in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere winter <b>stratosphere</b> {{exhibits}} prominent traveling planetary-scale Rossby waves, {{which generally}} {{are not able}} to induce Stratospheric Sudden Warmings. A series of runs of a simplified general circulation model is presented, aimed at better understanding the generation of these waves. While the generation of planetary-scale traveling waves through the interaction of synoptic-scale waves is observed in a control run, when the model is truncated to permit only waves with zonal wave number 1 or 2, the long waves are found to increase in strength, leading to a considerably more active stratosphere including Sudden Warmings comparable in strength to Northern Hemisphere winter. This finding suggests that the role of tropospheric synoptic eddies is two-fold: while generating a weak planetary-scale wave flux into the stratosphere, their main effect is to suppress baroclinic instability of planetary-scale waves by stabilizing the tropospheric mean state.

40|$|Seven years (1979 - 1985) of NMC {{data are}} used to analyze <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere middle <b>stratosphere</b> winter-to-summer {{circulation}} transitions. These transitions are classified into two extreme categories: (1) a mid-October final warming accompanied by a major mid-October wave event (1979 and 1982), and (2) a mid-November final warming with no strong October wave event (1980 and 1981). After the final warming a wave event in late November-early December results in {{the disappearance of the}} polar vortex. All of these wave events in conjunction with zonal mean mass motions act to reduce zonal mean gradients of potential vorticity and ozone through horizontal mixing, and hence they act to destroy the vortex and fill the ozone hole. Additionally, it is noted that the final warming and the vortex breakdown are two distinct events separated by 15 - 40 days. Finally, past studies show that the time of these events has not radically changed...|$|R
40|$|Warm pool" (WP) El Nino {{events are}} {{characterized}} by positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific. During austral spring, WP El Nino events are associated with an enhancement of convective activity in the South Pacific Convergence Zone, provoking a tropospheric planetary wave response and thus increasing planetary wave driving of the <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere <b>stratosphere.</b> These conditions lead to higher polar stratospheric temperatures and to a weaker polar jet during austral summer, as compared with neutral ENSO years. Furthermore, this response is sensitive to the phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) : a stronger warming is seen in WP El Nino events coincident with the easterly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) as compared with WP El Nino events coincident with a westerly or neutral QBO. The Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) chemistry-climate model (CCM) is used to further explore the atmospheric response to ENSO. Time-slice simulations are forced by composited SSTs from observed NP El Nino and neutral ENSO events. The modeled eddy heat flux, temperature and wind responses to WP El Nino events are compared with observations. A new gravity wave drag scheme has been implemented in the GEOS CCM, enabling the model to produce e realistic, internally generated QBO. By repeating the above time-slice simulations with this new model version, {{the sensitivity of the}} WP El Nino response to the phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation QBO is estimated...|$|R
40|$|Nine {{years of}} Nimbus- 7 SBUV ozone mixing ratio data (October 1978 -September 1987) {{have been used}} to analyze the {{distributions}} of the long-term average annual and semiannual ozone oscillations in the lower, middle, and upper stratosphere over the region 65 deg S to 65 deg N. It is shown that the derived harmonics are consistent with the result of earlier investigations based on limited sets of data. Year-to-year changes of amplitudes of the annual and semiannual variations are generally small except in the tropical midstratosphere (due to the effect of El Chichon) and the <b>southern</b> subpolar upper <b>stratosphere.</b> Analyses are also presented to show the vertical and seasonal distribution of the zonal ozone variations. It is shown that, for the long-term averaged data, wave 1 is larger during winter than summer and in winter larger in the Northern than Southern Hemisphere. The importance of photochemical and thermal/dynamic processes in modifying the time and zonal variations is discussed...|$|R
