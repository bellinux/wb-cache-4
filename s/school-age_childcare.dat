40|$|Playing is {{a common}} part of {{children}}’s leisure time, and with children spending an increasing amount of this time in <b>school-age</b> <b>childcare,</b> in both Sweden and England, staff {{have the responsibility to}} facilitate play. The way play is conceptualised by staff may lead to different aspects of play being facilitated. These play practices are enabled and constrained by the arrangements of what this dissertation calls the school’s play practice architecture, i. e. where play practices are intertwined with a school’s practice architecture. The aim of the research was to explore how staff talked about play and how to facilitate it, how concepts of play contributed to different play practices and how {{it might be possible to}} transform play practice architectures. The research draws on conversations with staff in <b>school-age</b> <b>childcare</b> settings in two Swedish and one English school during an action research project. Just as action research was used to disturb and change practice in order to understand it, concepts from Deleuze and Guattari’s philosophy (1980 / 2004) were put to work to disturb taken-for-granted concepts of play in order to explore how play works. Article I explores what the staff talked about in relation to play and its facilitation. The conclusion is that the ability of staff to interpret children’s play as children exploring their agency is crucial when facilitating play in a learning institution. Article II examines some discursive orders about play in <b>school-age</b> <b>childcare</b> and goes beyond them by conceptualising playing as becoming-different. The article argues that when foregrounding play, staff recognised children and themselves as becoming-players. Article III investigates how to think practice as constant change. For any practice, planning is required, and yet the unexpected keeps happening. When playing was conceptualised as a “What If? As If” approach, which allowed for potentialities to become actualised, then this approach was also useful as an approach in practice. The analysis suggests that when engaging in a playing practice, practitioners develop new knowledge and simultaneously change social situations. The practice of playing, whether intentional or unintentional, can not only disturb but also transform play practice architectures. The practice of playing is sensitised to the disturbances caused by playing and also puts itself “in play”. This opens up for a continuous de- and reterritorialisation of play and playing in <b>school-age</b> <b>childcare</b> practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{historical}} and recent growth of afterschool program (ASPs) in the U. S. {{is discussed in}} this article. Particular attention {{is given to the}} recent history of social and political influences that have led to growth and current popularity of ASPs. The article begins by reviewing changes in schooling and the labor force that created a supervision gap between the school day of children and work day of parents. This gap contributed to the need for afterschool child care. Next, influences leading to a growing recognition of the significance of <b>school-age</b> <b>childcare</b> for working families and their children, including research on the potential risks of self care and benefits of well-designed ASPs, are described. These discussions are contextualized alongside decades of social and political action and debate over the development of and funding for ASPs in America. Several key factors likely to affect after-school programming in the near future are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the ninth}} edition of our annual Report Card series, {{launched}} in 2009. Report Card 2017 {{is the first}} edition of the new series since the publication of 'A Programme for Partnership Government in May 2016 following the General Election. With the new Government comes a new set of commitments to be examined in the Report Card. The Government is awarded an overall 'D+' grade in Report Card 2017, reflecting a barely acceptable performance to date with little or no positive impact on children. However, it must be remembered that this Government has only been in power since May 2016. While the highest grade in Report Card 2017 is a 'B' for Subsidised and <b>School-Age</b> <b>Childcare,</b> the lowest grades have been awarded for Child and Family Homelessness and Traveller and Roma Children, both receiving an 'E'. The Children's Rights Alliance acknowledges the important groundwork that has been carried out {{in a number of areas}} but it is clear that much more must be done. We look forward to seeing greater progress over the coming year. The Report Card is a research tool aimed at improving the lives of all children in Ireland. We would like to thank our partners in helping to produce Report Card 2017 including Community Foundation of Ireland, the Katharine Howard Foundation, Pobal, The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Irish Youth Foundation.

40|$|Out-of-school time (OST) is {{a growing}} field that {{includes}} afterschool, evening, weekend, summer, <b>school-age</b> care, <b>childcare,</b> positive youth development, and workforce development programs (NIOST, 2000). Research demonstrates that OST professional development is critical to program quality and student impact (Weiss, 2005 / 2006). In an effort to diversify its offerings and impact youth participants, the OST field has begun experimenting with alternative formats of professional development (PD). Many of these new venues involve peer networking, peer mentoring, {{and other types of}} collegial support. ^ For this study, the author used an action research approach and a mixed-method strategy to examine three sets of OST peer networking meetings. She identified the fundamental ingredients of these activities and explored their prevalence and importance. She further examined specific phenomena such as how to foster networking, reconcile insider/outsider dynamics, balance cohesion with diversity, and create supportive environments. She noted how her three case students were similar and how they differed from one another. ^ Based upon her research project, the author offers multiple suggestions for understanding, designing, replicating, and evaluating peer networking meetings for OST staff. These recommendations are intended for staff who create, facilitate, and/or assess peer networking meetings, as well as for any executives, policymakers, funders, or other stakeholders who wish to better understand the composition and value of these professional development activities. ...|$|R
