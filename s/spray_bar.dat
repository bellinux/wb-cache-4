50|$|After the {{filtration}} step, {{washing liquid}} is introduced through feed distributor and separate <b>spray</b> <b>bar.</b> Under {{the effect of}} the centrifugal force, the washing liquid submerged into cake and filter. Washing can be carried out at the same or higher speed than the feeding step.|$|E
50|$|The {{usage of}} a {{chemical}} coating {{on the surface of}} the yankee is nowadays the rule. This is constituted by a mixture of usually 2 or more constituents: 1) a base polymer (adhesive) based on polyammides or epichlorhydrine resins which coats the surface of the yankee with a polymer layer in which the creping blade works, instead of scratching the iron surface. The base coating usually also has adhesive properties and keeps the paper attached to the yankee surface until creping2) a release agent based on mineral or vegetable oil or waxes which lubricates and improved the detaching of the paper from the surface3)various modifiers, which may make the coating more soft or hard or improve the protective effect on the yankeeThe coating is sprayed together with water in the space between the creping blade and the press through a <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> with nozzles. Only the narrow space between this <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> and the press is the one in which the water coming with the coating shall be evaporated and the polymer has to cure. For this reason for the base coating increasingly pre-cured polymers are used.|$|E

50|$|The Kompress series may {{be fitted}} with a hook for lifting loads of up to 100 kg (220 lb), or fitted with <b>spray</b> <b>bars</b> for {{agricultural}} work.|$|R
50|$|Also this {{equipment}} {{is used in}} washing processes, as material passes under <b>spray</b> <b>bars,</b> finer material and foreign material is washed through the screen. This {{is one example of}} wet screening.|$|R
50|$|Below the Bee {{is a new}} Sure Start. There {{are several}} {{superficial}} changes, including that {{the shape of the}} reed is different and it is now made of steel. The most substantial change (not visible) is in the carburettor, which now has a large brass <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> / barrier crossing the round barrel aperture, with a jet hole in its back center. The older carburettor has an abrupt increase in the diameter of the barrel (visible), with the jet {{at the top of the}} larger barrel section.|$|E
50|$|Adding {{too many}} fish too quickly or failing to allow {{enough time for}} the {{bacteria}} colony to establish itself in the filter media can lead to ammonia stress. This is not always fatal but can result {{in the death of}} aquarium fish. A few days after adding hardy fish for the cycling process, it is essential to look out for the key signs of ammonia stress. These include a lack of movement and appetite, inflammation and redness of the gills, fins, and body, and occasionally gasping for air at the water's surface. The latter can also be attributed to poor aeration, which can be negated by the inclusion of an air pump or <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> in the setup.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} started by {{reducing}} the compression and setting the <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> mixture rich with the adjustable needle valve, gradually increasing the compression while cranking the engine. The compression is increased until the engine starts running. The mixture can then be leaned out and the compression increased. Compared to glow plug engines, model diesel engines exhibit much higher fuel economy, thus increasing endurance {{for the amount of}} fuel carried. They also exhibit higher torque, enabling the turning of a larger or higher pitched propeller at lower speed. Since the combustion occurs well before the exhaust port is uncovered, these engines are also considerably quieter (when unmuffled) than glow-plug engines of similar displacement.|$|E
5000|$|Super Rotor went on {{to produce}} a two-seat version with dual {{controls}} as the M.1 Montalva, a turbo-charged two-seater as the M.2 Trovão Azul ("Blue Thunder"), and an agricultural version with <b>spray</b> <b>bars</b> as the Agricóptero.|$|R
25|$|Its next {{role was}} in aerial {{application}} with first Chris Stolzfus and Associates in 1962, and then Dothan Aviation Corporation in 1966, where the aircraft had a chemical hopper and <b>spray</b> <b>bars</b> fitted under the wings. After operating as a pest control, forest dusting and fire fighting aircraft, the aircraft wound up its postwar career in 1976.|$|R
50|$|Circle-throw {{machines}} {{are larger than}} others, and may require greater space than other screening units. Fine, wet, sticky materials require a water spray to wash fine materials under <b>spray</b> <b>bars.</b> Circle-throws have a large stroke and allow heavy components to circulate and interfere with the screen box. A powerful motor is needed, while other separators may not.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} the [...] "Poor man's Tee Dee" [...] these were similar to the Tee Dee in {{appearance}} but had cheaper parts on them, making them cheaper to buy. The cylinder was a non tapered twin bypass with no boost ports (like the one used on the Black Widow), the crank shaft was drilled out rather than milled like the Tee Dee, and the carb body was a one piece unit with a conventional needle valve and <b>spray</b> <b>bar.</b> These engines were marketed as a Sport / Stunt engine as they were much tamer and much less cantankerous than the Tee Dee. These are a great reliable easy to use little engine even today. They can be purchased for under $20US in 2008. R/C versions of this engine were also produced with exhaust throttle. i.e. 1968 Cat#240-1 and the 1988 Cat#2501 with muffler/throttle.|$|E
50|$|The 2500 units {{homologation}} cars {{built to}} allow Toyota {{to enter the}} GT-Four as a Group A car in the World Rally Championship also sported extras such as all of the plumbing required to activate an anti-lag system, a water <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> and pump for the front intercooler, a basic water injection system, a small hood-mounted spoiler aft of the windscreen washers (also standard fit on all UK cars) and an extender rear spoiler mounted on risers. Out of the 2500 GT-Four WRC built, 2100 stayed in Japan, 300 were exported to Europe, 77 for Australia, 5 for New Zealand and a few to the general markets.The Japanese market ST205 came with a standard automatic climate control air conditioner, but ABS was initially optional and became standard from August 1996. Export WRC models only received a manual air conditioner system but all came with standard ABS.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of drive-through systems {{is that the}} vehicle {{does not have to}} stop for cleaning. As the vehicle passes the magnetic-sensor or photo-sensor at the entrance, the washing process is triggered. During the slow passage (5 mph speed) through the wash platform, the vehicle's tires, wheel wells and mud flaps are cleaned by water sprayed from many strategically placed nozzles (<b>spray</b> <b>bar).</b> The nozzles are mounted angle-iron grids which open the tire treads and flushing the mud for a high cleaning performance. The washing platform is usually of galvanized steel. The first modern systems were introduced as the MobyDick “Quick” series at a German construction industry trade exhibition. The Quick system was a significant design improvement from the modified high pressure truck wash systems that were used as wheel and tire wash systems before. Today all modern drive through systems are based on the engineering and design development of the Quick series.|$|E

50|$|The Skytrac 1 was {{followed}} by a second machine with pontoons and a V-tail {{at the end of a}} boom for improved directional control. The third prototype had three seats in a more conventional cabin structure, and was fitted with <b>spray</b> <b>bars</b> and chemical tanks for demonstration of the type's potential as an agricultural machine. Certification of the design was achieved in 1969.|$|R
50|$|The Anahuac Tauro is a Mexican {{agricultural}} aircraft built in small {{numbers in the}} late 1960s and 1970s. The first prototype flew on 3 December 1968, with Mexican Type certification (the first type approved by Mexico's DGAC) following on 8 August 1969. It was a low-wing braced monoplane of conventional configuration with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The wing was of constant chord and had <b>spray</b> <b>bars</b> installed along its trailing edge.|$|R
5000|$|Thick {{juice is}} fed to the crystallizers. Recycled sugar is {{dissolved}} into it, {{and the resulting}} syrup is called mother liquor. The liquor is concentrated further by boiling under a vacuum in large vessels (the so-called vacuum pans) and seeded with fine sugar crystals. These crystals grow as sugar from the mother liquor forms around them. The resulting sugar crystal and syrup mix is called a massecuite, from [...] "cooked mass" [...] in French. The massecuite is passed to a centrifuge, where the High Green syrup {{is removed from the}} massecuite by centrifugal force. After a predeterminedtime, water is then sprayed into the centrifuge via a <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> to wash the sugar crystals which produces Low Green syrup. The centrifuge then spins at very high speed to partially dry the crystals the machine then slows down and a plough shaped arm is deployed which ploughs out the sugar from the sides of the centrifuge from the top to the bottom onto conveying plant underneath where it is transported into a rotating granulator where it is dried using warm air.|$|E
50|$|The Tsikada has a metal wing, {{rectangular}} in {{plan and}} with small downturned tips. The engines are mounted over the wing as close together as the propeller discs allow. They, and the wing centre section are supported over the fuselage {{by a short}} cabane; a single faired strut on each side braces the wing to the lower fuselage, assisted by a jury strut. The composite skinned fuselage has one or two rows of side by side seats, each {{with a pair of}} side windows in the doors, behind a single piece windscreen. There is a baggage compartment with a maximum load of 40 kg. Aft of the cabin the fuselage tapers, with an upswept underside, to a tall swept fin and balanced rudder. The rectangular tailplane, externally braced from above and carrying separate, unbalanced elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement, is mounted on the fin a little above the fuselage. The tricycle undercarriage has mainwheels on sprung cantilever legs and a steerable oleo sprung nose wheel. A chemical hopper with underwing <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> and discharge chute from the central fuselage underside is an option.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to achieve zero boil-off (ZBO) with cryogenic propellant storage using an active thermal control system. Tests conducted at the NASA Lewis Research Center's Supplemental Multilayer Insulation Research Facility (SMIRF) over the summer of 1998 demonstrated that a hybrid thermal control system could eliminate boiloff of cryogenic propellants. The hardware consisted of a pressurized 50-ft³ (ca. 1416 litres) tank insulated with 34 layers of multi-layer insulation (MLI), a condenser, and a Gifford-McMahon (GM) cryocooler that has a cooling capacity of 15 to 17.5 watt (W). Liquid hydrogen was the test fluid. The test tank was installed into a vacuum chamber, simulating space vacuum.In 2001, a cooperative effort by NASA's Ames Research Center, Glenn Research Center, and Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was implemented to develop zero-boiloff concepts for in-space cryogenic storage. Main program element was a large-scale, zero-boiloff demonstration using the MSFC multipurpose hydrogen test bed (MHTB) - 18.10 m3 LH2 tank (about 1300 kg of H2). A commercial cryocooler was interfaced with an existing MHTB <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> mixer and insulation system {{in a manner that}} enabled a balance between incoming and extracted thermal energy.|$|E
40|$|Two Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probes {{were used}} to measure droplet {{distributions}} in the NASA Lewis Icing Research Tunnel. The instruments showed good agreement when the median volume diameter (MVD) was approximately 16 micrometers. Coincidence events affect much of the data and caused the measured MVD to be about 2 to 3 micrometers larger than expected. Coincidence events were reduced by shutting down half of the <b>spray</b> <b>bars</b> in the tunnel during certain tests...|$|R
50|$|The Aiglet was {{particularly}} suited to use by agricultural spraying and dusting contractors. The <b>spray</b> <b>bars</b> were installed using supports on the Aiglet's fuselage undersurfaces and the wing struts. Most sales were to Australia and New Zealand but seven were supplied to Aerial Spraying Contractors Ltd of Boston, Lincolnshire. These were flown out to Sudan in autumn 1950 {{and within a}} month had rid 17,000 acres of farmland of locusts and other insect pests.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} {{increase in}} afterburner exit volume flow is accommodated {{by increasing the}} throat area of the propulsion nozzle. Otherwise, the upstream turbomachinery rematches (probably causing a compressor stall or fan surge in a turbofan application). The first designs, e.g. Solar afterburners used on the F7U Cutlass, F-94 Starfire and F-89 Scorpion, had 2-position eyelid nozzles. Modern designs incorporate not only VG nozzles but multiple stages of augmentation via separate <b>spray</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Production of the GT-Four (or {{previously}} {{known as}} All-Trac in the US), continued for the Japanese, Australian, European, and British markets. This ST205 version {{was to be}} the most powerful Celica produced to date, producing [...] (export version) or [...] (Japanese market) from an updated 3S-GTE engine. Influenced strongly by Toyota Team Europe, Toyota's factory team in the World Rally Championship, {{the final version of the}} GT-Four included improvements such as an all-aluminum hood to save weight, four-channel ABS (with G-force sensor), an improved turbocharger (incorrectly known by enthusiasts as the CT20B), and Super Strut Suspension. The 2500 homologation cars built to allow Toyota to enter the GT-Four as a Group A car in the World Rally Championship also sported extras such as all of the plumbing required to activate an anti-lag system, a water <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> for the Intercooler's front heat exchanger, a water injection system for detonation protection, a hood spoiler mounted in front of the windscreen to stop hood flex at high speed and the standard rear spoiler mounted on riser blocks. The car proved to be quite competitive in the 1995 World Championship. However, the team was banned from competition for a year after the car's single victory due to turbocharger fixing - a device that meant there was no air path restriction on the intake - when the jubilee clip was undone this would flick back into place so as to go un-noticed by inspectors. Toyota has always claimed that they knew nothing of the fix - but opponents say it was one very cleverly engineered device. In some respects this car is a true sports car; in order to qualify for rallying it has a lot of special features and a unique strut arrangement.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 38 {{hydrogen}} no-vent fill tests were performed {{in this test}} series using various size spray nozzles and a <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> with different hole sizes in a 5 cubic foot receiver tank. Fill levels of 90 percent by volume or greater were achieved in 26 of the tests while maintaining a receiver tank pressure below 30 psia. Spray nozzles were mounted {{at the top of}} the tank, whereas, the <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> was centered in the tank axially. The spray nozzle no-vent fills demonstrated tank pressure and temperature responses comparable to previous test series. Receiver tank pressure responses for the <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> configuration were similar to the spray nozzle tests with the pressure initially rising rapidly, then leveling off as vapor condenses onto the discharging liquid streams, and finally ramping up near the end of the test due to ullage compression. Both liquid injection techniques tested were capable of filling the receiver tank to 90 percent under variable test conditions. Comparisons between the spray nozzle and <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> configurations for well matched test conditions indicate the spray nozzle injection technique is more effective in minimizing the receiving tank pressure throughout a no-vent fill compared to the <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> under normal gravity conditions...|$|E
40|$|A new <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> {{system was}} designed, fabricated, and {{installed}} in the NASA Glenn Research Center's Icing Research Tunnel (IRT). This system {{is key to the}} IRT's ability to do aircraft in-flight icing cloud simulation. The performance goals and requirements levied on the design of the new <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> system included increased size of the uniform icing cloud in the IRT test section, faster system response time, and increased coverage of icing conditions as defined in Appendix C of the Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR), Part 25 and Part 29. Through significant changes to the mechanical and electrical designs of the previous-generation <b>spray</b> <b>bar</b> system, the performance goals and requirements were realized. Postinstallation aerodynamic and icing cloud calibrations were performed to quantify the changes and improvements made to the IRT test section flow quality and icing cloud characteristics. The new and improved capability to simulate aircraft encounters with in-flight icing clouds ensures that the 1 RT will continue to provide a satisfactory icing ground-test simulation method to the aeronautics community...|$|E

50|$|The Kanpur I was {{designed}} by an Indian Air Vice-Marshal and built in 132 days at the Indian Air Force Maintenance Command Development Centre at their Kanpur air base. A more powerful version, the Kanpur II, was intended for production as a military general-purpose and army observation machine, though serious consideration was also given to an agricultural role. For this, the prototype Kanpur I was fitted with <b>spray</b> <b>bars.</b> The Kanpur I dates from about 1960 and the Kanpur II first flew in October 1961.|$|R
