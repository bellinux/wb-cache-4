The hope of confiscations was now active in the bosoms of all this set, {{and many of them}} had even selected the portions of property that they intended should be the reward of their own love of freedom and patriotism. It has been said that the English ministry precipitated the American revolution, with a view to share, among their favourites, the estates that it was thought it would bring within the gift of the crown, a motive so heinous as almost to defy credulity, and which may certainly admit of rational doubts. On the other hand, however, it is certain that individuals, who will go down to posterity in company with the many justly illustrious names that the events of 1776 have committed to history, were actuated by the most selfish inducements, and, in divers instances, enriched themselves with the wrecks of estates that formerly belonged to their kinsmen or friends. Joel Strides was of too low a class to get his name enrolled very {{high on the list of}} heroes, nor was he at all ambitious of any such distinction; but he was not so low that he could not and did not aspire to become the owner of the property of the Hutted Knoll. In an ordinary state of society, so high a flight would seem irrational in so low an aspirant; but Joel came of a people who seldom measure their pretensions by their merits, and who imagine that to boldly aspire, more especially in the way of money, is the first great <b>step</b> <b>to</b> <b>success.</b> The much talked of and little understood doctrine of political equality has this error to answer for, in thousands of cases; for nothing can be more hopeless, in the nature of things, than to convince a man of the necessity of possessing qualities of whose existence he has not even a faint perception, ere he may justly pretend to be put on a level with the high-minded, the just, the educated, and the good. Joel, therefore, saw no other reason than the law, against his becoming the great landlord, as well as captain Willoughby; and could the law be so moulded as to answer his purposes, he had discreetly resolved to care for no other considerations. The thought of the consequences to Mrs. Willoughby and her daughters gave him no concern whatever; they had already possessed the advantages of their situation so long, as to give Phoebe and the miller's wife a sort of moral claim to succeed them. In a word, Joel, in his yearnings after wealth, had only faintly shadowed forth the modern favourite doctrine of [...] "rotation in office." ...|$|E

40|$|The First <b>Step</b> <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> early {{intervention}} program (Walker, 1998) is a secondary prevention intervention that targets primary grade children with moderate or emerging behavior disorders. While {{the effectiveness of}} the First <b>Step</b> <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> {{early intervention}} program has been documented repeatedly (see Loman, Rodriguez, 2 ̆ 6 Homer, 2010; Walker et aI., 2009), it has also been shown to be less effective with more severely disordered children and has a less dramatic impact on behavior in the home than in the school setting. Efforts to enhance the program 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness with even the most severely behaviorally disordered children have been undertaken, and completed. This research collaboration between the Oregon Research Institute and the University of Louisville examined the utility and feasibility of enhancements to the home and classroom components of the First <b>Step</b> <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> intervention. These enhancements, which rely heavily on the infusion of Motivational Interviewing (Miller 2 ̆ 6 Rollnick, 2002) practices, broadened the ecological focus of the intervention and produced significant changes in the participating children and their families. The following dissertation examines enhancements focused on the classroom teacher 2 ̆ 7 s use of praise to help replace the intervention 2 ̆ 7 s systematic use of external reinforcers; and to reduce the attention for inappropriate behavior (reprimands) that often inadvertently maintains the challenging behavior teachers seek to eliminate. The resulting enhancement, hereafter referred to as the First Step Classroom Check-up, is largely based on the original work of Reinke, Lewis-Palmer, and Merrell (2008). An open multiple-case-study design (Meyers, Truscott, Meyers, Varjas 2 ̆ 6 Collins, 2007) was used to investigate the intervention for the purpose of innovation and development. The observed increase in teachers 2 ̆ 7 use of praise and decreased reprimands, along with overall positive responses in terms of the interventions social validity, and positive child outcomes provide support for the integration of the Classroom Check-up (Reinke et al., 2008) into an Enhanced version of the First <b>Step</b> <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> Early Intervention Program. These outcomes also demonstrate the promise of future investigations ofthese interventions separately, and as combined and the probability that the efficacy of the intervention could be investigated...|$|E

Three typically developing students (2 kindergarten and 1 first grade) and their respective teachers served as participants. Student behavior and teacher implementation fidelity were assessed using a nonconcurrent multiple baseline design across student/teacher dyads, in which a no coaching baseline was followed by a performance feedback condition. The baseline phase showed modest levels of implementation fidelity and initial low levels of problem behavior followed by gradually increasing trends. A relation was demonstrated between coaching feedback and improved implementation fidelity. In addition, improved fidelity was associated with improvements in student problem behavior. Implications are drawn for clinical application of FSS and other “manualized” interventions...|$|E

40|$|March 30, 2007 Change is inevitable. Nowhere is that {{statement}} more prevalent {{than in the}} training of merchant marine cadets. But do we fight off the change, protecting those teaching models we hold sacred? Or do we embrace change, seeking to incorporate what is new with the concepts and skill sets that should endure? Changes in technology alone mandate new and revised skill sets from our graduates; admittedly, many older skills are no longer practical. In looking {{at the rate of}} change in technology alone, it is clear that we cannot hope to parallel the same change rate in education. Increasing public and industry scrutiny of incidents in the profession necessitate personnel at more highly assessed competency levels. If nothing else, most of us desire to produce the best-trained students to work in a field from whence we matriculated. 	The program revision model recommended here is a basic, operational format for constructive change.

40|$|Social {{competency}} {{training is}} a common intervention for students at risk for developing or classified with emotional/behavioral disorders. However, a review of research indicated {{that it is only}} mildly effective in producing significant outcomes for these students. A number of factors have been identified as possibly impacting the success of social competency training, including: the intervention setting, the timing of intervention, characteristics of participants, characteristics of interventions and the outcome measurements ~d. A review of literature was conducted to evaluate these factors. Findings of the review indicate that there are not significant differences between interventions conducted in regular education and resource or small group settings. The most compelling results were from interventions based in self-contained or specialized settings; however, there were {{only a small number of}} studies in this setting. Timing of intervention does not appear to be a significant factor. In the studies reviewed, outcomes were slightly more positive for pre-school and kindergarten age children and older elementary school age students compared to first and second grade age groups. In terms of participant characteristics, students with the most severe behaviors and students with externalizing behaviors were more positively impacted than students with mild or moderate behaviors or internalizing behaviors. Characteristics of the most successful interventions were those with individualization procedures, treatment matched to symptoms, programs using the First <b>Step</b> <b>to</b> <b>Success,</b> the use of emotional competency training, interventions using peers as trainers or role models and the use of specific behavioral strategies, such as group contingencies. The outcome measurements with the most compelling results were direct observations, followed by socio-metrics and self-reports. Academic assessments and rating scales had the least significant outcomes. Limitations include comparing studies with single subject designs to studies using control group designs and drawing conclusions based on small numbers of studies with specific characteristics...|$|E
