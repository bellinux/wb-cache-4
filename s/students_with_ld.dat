Principals were also interviewed to corroborate data. Two-hundred and seventy-eight general education teachers participated on the online survey administered via Qualtrics and ten principals were interviewed in this study. The survey instrument was analyzed for validity and reliability. More than half the teachers currently had or previously had <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDs.</b> Teacher preparation, academic climate, teaching approaches, teaching strategies and teacher effectiveness were themes that emerged from factor analysis. The ANOVA test identified statistically significant relationships between-years of experience, degree field, and expertise in special education. The degree field, route of certification, expertise in special education, and having <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> in classroom was related to the teaching strategy employed by teachers. Teacher effectiveness was related to degree field, with expertise in special education and also with if they have had <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDs.</b> The academic climate in schools was enhanced by the presence of resource room. General education teachers had a positive attitude towards inclusion and provide multiple strategies for accommodating <b>students</b> <b>with</b> learning disabilities. Class size was considered critical by most general teachers when inclusion was being provided. Principals interviewed in this study reported that teachers had negative attitudes towards inclusion of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> and believed that instructing <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> was no different from teaching regular students. Teachers desired smaller class sizes when they had <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> in their classrooms.

Our findings are based on an empirical study that comprised 417 students, 5 of whom 85 were <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD.</b> Based on sociometric analyses of all participating classes, we determined that <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> were less integrated into the classroom in comparison to their peers without LD. The results of the sociometric analysis show statistically significant differences in the sociometric position between <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> and students without LD.

The thesis also {{examines the}} effectiveness of the attributional retraining technique in enhancing the academic self-perceptions of students with learning and attentional difficulties. The thesis is developed in three stages: Stage- 1 is concerned with the development of two instruments for the assessment of academic attributional style and academic self-efficacy beliefs for students in Grade 3 to 6. This stage examines the factor analysis, reliability and validity outcomes of these instruments. Stage- 2 concerns itself with a comprehensive examination of the self-concept, attributional style and self-efficacy beliefs of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD,</b> students with comorbid LD/ADHD and normally achieving peers. Based on the existing literature, a number of hypotheses concerning the directions of the difference in the self-perceptions of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> and with comorbid LD/ADHD were examined. Stage- 3 is concerned with the implementation and assessment of the effectiveness of an intervention program that was designed for the enhancement of academic self-concept. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> and students with comorbid LD/ADHD whose academic self-concept scores fell in the lowest quartile participated in this intervention program. The intervention utilized the attributional retraining technique and the effectiveness of attributional retraining in enhancing academic self-concept of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> and with comorbid LD/ADHD was examined. The results obtained from Stage- 2 revealed that <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> and students with comorbid LD/ADHD possessed significantly lowered academic self-concept compared to normally achieving peers. However the three groups (LD, LD/ADHD and normally achieving peers) did not differ significantly on non-academic self-concepts.

40|$|How {{is special}} {{education}} {{for students with}} learning disabili-ties “special”? One way to approach this question is to review the intervention and descriptive studies of instruction and ser-vices {{for students with learning}} disabilities (LD) and report the ways in which special education provides a differentiated and appropriate education for students. At least with respect to the education that <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> receive within general education, existing reviews reveal that undifferentiated in-struction not specifically designed to meet the instructional needs of the student with LD prevails (see for review, Baker & Zigmond, 1995; McIntosh, Vaughn, Schumm, Haager, & Lee, 1993; Zigmond et al., 1995). Thus, there is a gap between what we know about effective instruction and the extent to which these practices are carried over into instructional set-tings. However, we were concerned that focusing on this would ignore aspects of special education that are associated with improved outcomes for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD.</b> In this article, we describe what was perceived in the not-so-distant past as necessary special instruction for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> and the relatively recent view linking progress mon-itoring and instructional outcomes as markers for progress with <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD.</b> In order to address the question of what is special about special education for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD,</b> we first briefly review the literature about how special education was initially conceptualized for these students and how ef-fective instructional models for those students have shifted from using underlying process approaches to emphasizing in-structional effectiveness based on students ’ learning in core academic areas.

40|$|Learning disabilities" (LD) {{refer to}} a number of disorders, that may affect the acquisition, organization, retention, understanding, or use of verbal or non-verbal {{information}} (Siegal, 1999). " These disorders affect learning in people who otherwise demonstrate at least average abilities essential for thinking and/or reasoning. When one considers the definition of LD and its direct impact on learning, {{it is not surprising that}} one of the areas of life most affected by learning disabilities is education. This paper synthesized information on the history and current definitions of the term LD, and investigated the link with research as to the neurobiological basis of a LD. How to diagnose a LD and who is qualified to diagnose a LD are researched and the nature and characteristics of individuals <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> are reviewed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the legal obligations that exist in Canada for postsecondary institutions to provide "reasonable accommodations" for individuals with learning disabilities. Based on the literature, there is need for continued research in the area of LD. [...] This paper synthesizes literature, related to the successful transition of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> learning disabilities (<b>LD)</b> to the post-secondary level. The first section outlines the history of transition services. The second section reviews the literature on transitioning services and the <b>student</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD,</b> and how to properly prepare these students for all the major areas of adult functioning including employment, continuing education, daily living, health, leisure, communication and interpersonal skills. The literature is reviewed on the transitioning services required to assure the successful transition to post secondary institutions. Research (for e. g. Dunn (1996) and Rojewski (1992)) has shown an individualized transition plan promotes self-awareness and self-determination by the <b>student</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD,</b> and that involves all stakeholders promoting the successful transitioning beyond high school. [...] This paper reviews the literature relevant to the contemporary understanding of what is considered a "reasonable" accommodation at the postsecondary level. Defining what a learning disability (LD) is and what transition services they need to maximize their potential at the postsecondary level is reviewed, as well as the process followed in order for the <b>student</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> to receive accommodations. This paper presents research that indicates that most faculty members are willing to provide accommodations, but are concerned with determining the nature and extend of the provisions. Due to the request for accommodations, both the institution and the student involved often face challenges to assure that the integrity of coursework is not jeopardized. Canadian legislation, such as the Charter of Rights and Freedom and the Canadian Human Rights Act, assures the rights of individuals <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> are protected at the postsecondary level are reviewed. The final sections review how the literature defining reasonable accommodations and support programs for individuals <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> at the postsecondary level. Research (for e. g., Strasburger, Tumer, Wallis (1998)) has shown that the most success for assuring an accommodation is reasonable is when the essential requirements for a course or program of study are defined, and the accommodations do not impinge on these requirements...|$|R

The worrying concern is that two-thirds to half of these <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> remain undiagnosed when they start their undergraduate education and may even graduate without having their disabilities diagnosed. These <b>students</b> struggle <b>with</b> their academic abilities, receive poor grades and, as a result, develop lower perceptions of their intellectual abilities than do those students without LDs. All these ultimately hamper their professional practice, employment, and career progression. Appropriate and adequate educational policies, provisions, and practices help students to progress satisfactorily. In Asian countries, public and professional awareness about LDs is low, supportive provisions are limited, legislations are inadequate, data are scarce, and equal-opportunity/widening-participation policies are not implemented effectively in the HE sector. This article discusses the issues related to LDs in medical education and draws policy, provision, and practice implications to identify, assess, and support <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> in medical schools, particularly in an Asian context.

40|$|Specific {{learning}} disability {{is by far}} the most prevalent of the 13 special education categories recognized under the Individuals with Disabilities Educational Act (IDEA), consisting of approximately 2. 5 million students and comprising 42 % of all children receiving special education services in public schools (Cortiella, 2011). Research suggests that learning disabilities (LDs) are chronic conditions with lifetime implications (Morris, Schraufnagel, Chudhow, & Weinberg, 2009), and by high school, <b>students</b> identified <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> are reading at an average of 3. 4 years below grade level (Cortiella, 2011). Such profound reading deficits result in pervasive academic difficulties, as compared to their non-disabled peers. Thus, <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> are at a substantial disadvantage for accessing the curriculum (Cortiella, 2011; Shaywitz, 2003). Not surprisingly, <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> are more likely to drop out of high school, less likely to pursue postsecondary education, and twice as likely to be unemployed (Cortiella, 2011). In light of the drastic impact LDs have upon students and their academic success, schools must make concerted efforts to provide research-based supports for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> in order to minimize these disadvantages. Research suggests that improvements in note-taking may be one way to increase academic achievement, and thus the prominence of lectures, coupled with the established benefits of lecture note-taking, provides unique intervention opportunities to target special education students. The purpose of this study was to compare the lecture note-taking skills of adolescents <b>with</b> and without <b>LDs</b> by exploring the role of cognitive processes speculated to impact note-taking ability and proficiency. While existing research identifies discrepancies between the quality of notes recorded by <b>students</b> <b>with</b> and without <b>LDs,</b> little is known about the underlying cognitive processes causing these differences. Building upon this previous research, with consideration to the unique characteristics of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDs,</b> this study investigates the following cognitive processes theorized to impact the note-taking skills of adolescents with and without LDs: (1) handwriting speed, (2) listening comprehension, (3) sustained attention, and (4) background knowledge. The researcher hypothesized that 1) NLD students would outperform LD students across all independent and dependent variables, 2) LD status, listening comprehension, handwriting speed, background knowledge, and sustained attention would significantly predict notes, 3) LD status, listening comprehension, handwriting speed, background knowledge, sustained attention, and notes would significantly predict multiple-choice test performance, and 4) the prediction pattern for the LD group would be the same as the prediction pattern for the NLD group. Participants were recruited from two northeast high schools, located within the same urban school district, and specific selection criteria were identified for the LD and NLD groups. All students selected for the LD group were required to have an IQ score of 70 or above, based on the most recent psychological assessment. Additionally, all potential participants completed a screening session to assess their reading comprehension skills and confirm their appropriateness for the assigned group. The final sample included 70 adolescents with a mean age of 16. 1 (SD= 1. 23). After the screening, all participants completed two sessions in small groups within a ten-day period. During the first session, participants were asked to (a) view a video-recorded lecture while simultaneously taking notes on the lecture content, (b) complete a demographics questionnaire, (c) review their lecture notes, (d) complete a measure of handwriting speed, and (e) complete a multiple-choice test based on the lecture content. In the second experimental session, participants were asked to (a) complete a measure of listening comprehension, (b) complete a measure of background knowledge, and (c) complete a measure of sustained attention. Consistent with hypothesis, results of the study indicated that NLD students significantly outperformed LD students across all measures. However, contrary to hypotheses, LD status was the only significant predictor of notes' total. Additionally, LD status, handwriting speed, listening comprehension, and background knowledge predicted test performance. When the LD and NLD groups were analyzed separately, none of the independent variables predicted notes' quality. Interestingly, handwriting speed predicted multiple-choice test performance for the LD group, but listening comprehension and background knowledge predicted multiple-choice test performance for the NLD group. Overall, compared to their NLD peers, LD adolescents struggled significantly across all independent and dependent variables, and given the outcomes, it appears as though LD status mediated the relationship between the cognitive variables and note-taking...|$|R
40|$|Students with {{learning}} disabilities (LD) are attending two-year postsecondary institutions (i. e., junior, community, and vocational/technical colleges) at an increasing rate. One of the critical challenges facing <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> and their service providers is interacting with faculty (Brinckerhoff, Shaw, 2 ̆ 6 McGuire, 1993; McGuire 2 ̆ 6 Anderson, 1993; Rose, 1993).

40|$|ABSTRACT: One hundred eighty-one {{students}} with learning disabilities (LD) and 184 {{students with}}out LD completed four brie. f, parallel tests under four conditions (standard, extended time, largeprint, students reading aloud). we (a) examined whether <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> bene-fited from accommodations more than students without LD; (b) estimated "typical " accom-modation boosts among nondisabled students; and (c) awarded accommodations to <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> whose boostsexceeded the "typical " boost. Teachers provided independent accommo-dation judgments, and <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD</b> completed a large-scale assessment with and without accommodations. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LD,</b> as a group, profited differentially from reading aloud, not from extended time or large print; teachers'decisions did not correspond to benefits stu-dents derived, ' the data-based assessmentpredicted differential performance on large-scale as-sessment better than teacherjudgments. T he 1997 amendments to the In-dividuals with Disabilities Edu-cation Act (IDEA) require thatstudents with disabilities be in-cluded in accountability pro-grams. In fact, if schools are to consider the needs of these students in reform and improve-ment activities, their outcomes must be repre-sented in public reports of student outcomes. Exceptional Children The hope is that participation in these programs will hold schools accountable for the learning of students with disabilities and encourage schools to establish challenging goals and identify effec-tive instructional approaches (McDonnell, McLaughlin, & Morison, 1997). Unfortunately, the performance of stu-dents with disabilities has not always "counted" in accountability programs. As recently as 1995...|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study examines, {{from the perspective}} of the families, the transition process to employment or postsecondary education for adolescents <b>with</b> learning disabilities (<b>LDs)</b> and the interplay of the roles of parents, <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>LDs,</b> and teachers. Using a case study design, series of three in-depth interviews were conducted with five individuals <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> and <b>with</b> their parents. Data were analyzed inductively. The findings indicate that the families all had informal transition plans; formal transition plans were not written. For four of the families, the transition process was successful and occurred in two phases spanning the elementary and secondary school years. In the first phase parents controlled the transition process, and during the second phase they transferred this responsibility to their children <b>with</b> <b>LDs.</b> Parents’ high expectations and advocacy; students’ hard work, self-determination and self-advocacy; and teachers’ mentoring and support also contributed to the achievement of transition goals. Throughout the process parents, adolescents <b>with</b> <b>LDs,</b> and teachers worked collaboratively. In the fifth case, only the factor of parental advocacy was in place, and it was insufficient to bring about a successful transition for the adolescent <b>with</b> <b>LDs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Learning disabilities (<b>LDs)</b> are {{associated}} <b>with</b> underachievement {{in one or}} more areas such as reading, spelling, writing and/or mathematics.
