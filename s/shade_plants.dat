40|$|Abstract This {{experiment}} aims to {{know the}} solar energy efficiency of four clones of cocoa that cultivated under three different <b>shading</b> <b>plants.</b> This experiment has been done from September until December 2013 located at Kaliwining Experiment Farm with characteristic 45 m above sea level, soil type is low humic gley, soil texture is silty clay loam, and climate classification type D based on Scmidht and Fergusson Classification. This experiment used Nested Design as Experimental Design with species of <b>shading</b> <b>plant</b> as main plot which are Teak (Tectona grandis L.), Krete (Cassia surattensis (Burm.) F.), Lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala L.) and Cocoa clones as sub plot which are Sulawesi 1, Sulawesi 2, KKM 22, KW 165. The observation of solar energy efficiency consists of daily solar radiation intensity, solar radiation intensity above plant, solar radiation intensity under plant, and also plant total dry weight. The experimental result showed that there is differences (heterogenity) between shading location based on homogenity test by Bartlett Method. There are some interaction between the kind of <b>shading</b> <b>plant</b> and clones in parameter of interception efficiency, absorbtion efficiency, the efficiency of solar energy that caught by plant, and solar energy conversion efficiency. The efficiency of solar energy that caught by plant will affect the solar energy conversion efficiency with R 2 = 0, 86.   Keywords : Solar Energy Efficiency, Cocoa Clones, <b>Shading</b> <b>Plant,</b> Nested Design, Bartlett Method </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} shade {{on the growth}} and {{development}} of Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) (L.) Pers.) was determined under glasshouse conditions. The plants were grown from shoot propagules in full light, under different layers of green netting (provides 42, 58 and 77 % <b>shade)</b> and under <b>plants</b> canopy {maize (65 % shade) and soybean (67 % shade) } for 42 to 84 days. Results have shown that continuous shading severely {{reduced the number of}} tillers, leaf area, leaf dry weight, stem dry weight, root dry weight and total dry weight of C. dactylon. After 84 days continuous <b>shading,</b> <b>plants</b> grown in 42, 58 and 77 % shade and with maize (65 % shade) or soybean (67 % shade) yielded only 25, 21, 7, 11 and 15 %, respectively as much total dry weight as the plants grown in full light. Shading at later growth stages also reduced growth of C. dactylon but early shading followed by full light at later stages had less shade effect. For example at the final harvest, plants that were transferred from 77 % shade to full light at day 42 after planting had 45 % of the total dry weight of the plants in the continuous full light treatment, but plants transferred from full light to 77 % shade at day 42 had only 27 % as much. Constant shading reduced Dry Matter Production (DMP), Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and Leaf Area Duration (LAD) but increased Leaf Area Ratio (LAR). <b>Plants</b> <b>shaded</b> after 42 days in full light maintained larger LAD then continuously <b>shaded</b> <b>plants</b> but had similar or lower NAR values to them during the shaded period.

40|$|Background and Aims A major {{challenge}} in plant ecophysiology is understanding {{the effects of}} multiple suboptimal environmental conditions on plant performance. In most Mediterranean areas soil salinity builds up during the summer because of low availability of soil water coupled with hot temperatures. Although sunlight and soil salinity may strongly interact in determining a plant's performance, this has received relatively little attention. Methods Two-year-old seedlings of Fraxinus ornus were grown outdoors in pots during a Mediterranean summer in either 45 % (<b>shaded</b> <b>plants)</b> or 100 %(sun plants) sunlight irradiance andwere supplied with either deionized water or deionized water plus 75 mM NaCl. Morpho-anatomical traits, water and ionic relations, gas exchange and photosystem II performance, concentrations of individual carotenoids, activity of antioxidant enzymes, concentrations of ascorbic acid and individual polyphenols were measured in leaves. Leaf oxidative stress and damagewere estimated by in vivo analysis of stable free radicals and ultrastructural analyses. Key Results Leaf concentrations of potentially toxic ions did not markedly differ in shadedor sunplants in response to salinity. Leaves of sunplants displayed superior water use efficiency compared with leaves of <b>shaded</b> <b>plants,</b> irrespective of salinity treatment, andhad both better stomatal control and higher CO 2 carboxylation efficiency than leaves of <b>shaded</b> <b>plants.</b> In the salt-treated groups, the adverse effects of excess midday irradiancewere greater in shade than in sun plants. The activity of enzymes responsible for detoxifying hydrogen peroxide decreased in <b>shaded</b> <b>plants</b> and increased in sun plants {{as a result of}} salinity stress. In contrast, the activity of guaiacol peroxidase and the concentration of phenylpropanoids increased steeply in response to salinity in <b>shaded</b> <b>plants</b> but were unaffected in sun plants. Conclusions It is concluded that salinity may constrain the performance of plants growing under partial shading more severely than that of plants growing under full sun during summer. The results suggest co-ordination within the antioxidant defence network aimed at detoxifying salt-induced generation of reactive oxygen species...|$|R
40|$|Plastic {{responses}} of plants to one factor may alter {{their response to}} others, placing limits {{on the benefits of}} phenotypic plasticity. To examine interactions between two phenotypically plastic responses, I studied the effects of lateral shading and jasmonic acid treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes on morphology, phenology, seed production, and chemical defense traits. Lateral shading was imposed by growing A. thaliana rosettes in pots equipped with opaque forest‐green plastic collars that disproportionately reduced lateral light availability relative to vertical light availability and altered light quality. Lateral shading greatly delayed flowering but increased leaf number, main stem height, and total seed production. Leaves of <b>shaded</b> <b>plants</b> were longer and had a lower blade‐to‐petiole length ratio than leaves of unshaded plants. Leaves of jasmonic acid–treated plants had a higher blade‐to‐petiole length ratio than leaves of untreated plants in both light environments but were shorter than leaves of untreated <b>plants</b> in <b>shaded</b> conditions only. Peroxidase activity in uninduced plants was similar in both light environments and was induced by jasmonic acid only in <b>shaded</b> <b>plants.</b> Trypsin inhibitor levels were lower overall in unshaded <b>plants</b> than in <b>shaded</b> <b>plants,</b> but their levels were inducible by jasmonic acid in both light environments. In turn, jasmonic acid treatment had an effect on seed production only in the shaded treatment, in which peroxidase activity and trypsin inhibitor reached high levels. Increases in seed production in <b>shaded</b> <b>plants</b> are probably the result of increased leaf production resulting from delayed flowering. Lateral <b>shading</b> and associated <b>plant</b> responses largely increased expression of the jasmonic acid–inducible defenses measured in this study. However, alterations in leaf length resulting from altered petiole and blade elongation are identified as a potentially important shade avoidance trait of A. thaliana that can be modified by jasmonic acid treatment...|$|R
