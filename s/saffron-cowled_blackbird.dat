40|$|Properly labeled museum {{specimens}} {{represent a}} principal data source for avian distri-butions. In {{the case of}} rare and threatened species, specimens document past localities and may provide evidence of historical range contractions (Collar et al. 1992), {{which is one of}} the main criteria for assigning threat status (Mace & Stuart 1991). Most reviews of the ranges of such taxa assume correct identification of skins, making it important to report incorrectly labelled museum specimens. <b>Saffron-cowled</b> <b>Blackbird</b> Xanthopsar flavus is currently considered Vulnerable (BirdLife International 2004). Five specimens attributed to this species held in the Instituto Miguel Lillo, Tucumán, Argentina, are misidentified. I personally checked the specimens and their labels on 9 November 2006. Specimen numbers are those of the Lillo collection. Specimen 02931 was collected by J. Esteban on 10 November 1944 at Colonia Dalmacia, prov. Formosa, Argentina, near the río Monte Lindo. It is an immature male Unicoloured Blackbird Agelasticus cyanopus, of the nominate race, with a female-type plumage but black cheeks. This transitional plumage was described by Parkes (1966). Because of its yellow underparts the specimen was wrongly labelled by the collector as <b>Saffron-cowled</b> <b>Blackbird...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>Saffron-cowled</b> <b>Blackbird,</b> Xanthopsar flavus (Gmelin, 1788), is a {{globally}} vulnerable icterid {{endemic to}} grasslands and open areas, and a priority species {{for research and}} conservation programs. This contribution provides information on the population size, habitat, behavior, breeding biology and nest success of X. flavus in two conservation units (CUs) in Viamão, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil: the Environmental Protection Area Banhado Grande, and the Wildlife Refuge Banhado dos Pachecos, classified as an “Important Bird Area”. Searches for X. flavus were carried out mainly in open areas, the type of habitat favored by the species. Outside the breeding season individual behavior was recorded by the ad libitum method; during the breeding season, selected X. flavus pairs were observed following the sequence sampling method. The research areas were visited once a month, totaling approximately 530 hours of observations (September 2014 to June 2016) over 84 days, which included two breeding seasons. The species was observed across all months (not necessarily within the same year) and several X. flavus flocks were encountered, some {{with more than one}} hundred individuals (range = 2 - 137). Additionally, the behavior and feeding aspects, habitat use and breeding information on X. flavus were recorded. Two breeding colonies were found, and eleven nests were monitored. The estimated nesting success was 10 % in Colony 1, but zero in Colony 2, where all eggs and nestlings were predated. Saffron-cowled Blackbirds were recorded in mixed flocks, mostly with Pseudoleistes guirahuro (Vieillot, 1819), P. virescens (Vieillot, 1819) and Xolmis dominicanus (Vieillot, 1823), the last also a globally endangered species. The collected information highlights the importance of CUs for the maintenance of X. flavus populations in the region. Maintenance of proper areas for feeding and breeding is necessary and urgent. Information from current research is being employed in the management plan of the Wildlife Refuge Banhado dos Pachecos in which X. flavus is one of the conservation target-species...|$|E
