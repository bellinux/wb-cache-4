The Socialist Left faction, as well as prominent Labor figure Barry Jones, offered severe criticism of a number of government decisions. He has also received criticism for his 'confrontationalist style' in siding with the airlines in the 1989 Australian pilots' strike. The Hawke Government did, however, significantly increase the <b>social</b> <b>wage</b> as part of its Accord with the trade unions, a social democratic policy continued by the Keating Government. Improvements to the <b>social</b> <b>wage</b> included improved affordability of and access to key services such as health and child-care and health, together with large increases to payments for low-wage and jobless families with children. Indexation of child payments was also introduced, while coverage of occupational superannuation pensions was also widened significantly, from 46% of employees in 1985 to 79% in 1991.|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{the number}} of {{industrial}} disputes fell, while inflation was brought under control. In the lead up to the 1984 budget, unions agreed to a wage/tax trade-off in which they forewent an indexed wage increase {{in return for a}} tax cut geared towards low and middle-income earners. Job protection, family leave, and a standard 38-hour workweek had been extended to most workers, whose living standards were protected via superannuation, <b>social</b> <b>wage</b> improvements, and tax cuts. Union members (and indeed, non-union members who were nonetheless covered by union-negotiated collective agreements) and their families benefited from lower inflation, more jobs, maternity allowances, family leave, trade union education, improved access to education, Medicare, superannuation, higher pensions, occupational health and safety improvements, family income supplements, and regular real wage increases from 1991 onwards (after having fallen under Hawke). Collective bargaining rights were enhanced, while an effective minimum wages system was sustained. By 1991, the lowest paid workers received additional increases through the mechanism of supplementary payments. It is arguable that most Australians were a little better off materially {{on the eve of the}} 1991 recession than in 1983.

5000|$|Since {{unemployment}} was rendered unviable {{through various}} acts of legislation, the Soviet worker, {{in contrast to}} a Capitalist worker, was more secure economically. In return for working, a Soviet worker would get an individual return {{in the form of a}} money wage; however, during the period under the New Economic Policy, hyperinflation rendered money effectively useless, and wages sometimes occurred through bartering. Money wage in Soviet parlance was not the same as in Capitalist countries. The money wage was set at the top of the administrative system, and it was the same administrative system which also set bonuses. Wages were 80 percent of the average Soviet workers income, with the remaining 20 coming in the form of bonuses. The Soviet wage system tried systematically to make wages more equal; for instance, the relationship between wages was termed [...] "ITRs", a measure of comparing wages across occupations. For engineers and other technical workers ITR was 1.68 in 1955, but had decreased to 1.21 in 1977. Social wages were also an important part of the general standard of living for an average household; it stood at 23.4 percent of income for the average Soviet worker and their family, and at 19.1 percent for the family income of collective farmers. In the period between 1971-81, the <b>social</b> <b>wage</b> grew faster than the money wage; the money wage grew by 45 percent for workers and employees and 72 for workers at collective farms. In contrast, per capita income from social wages increased by 81 percent. <b>Social</b> <b>wage</b> took many forms; it could be improved health, education, transport or food subsidies, which was the responsibility of the state, or the improvement (or introduction) of sanitation and working facilities.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{estimates}} of peer effects vary widely in the literature. To {{better understand the}} conflicting evidence, we develop a price theory of social interactions in which peer group membership is dictated by comparative advantage. Two key results emerge from the model. First, when comparative advantage is the guiding principle of peer group organization, the effect of transplanting a student into an environment with higher-achieving peers depends on where in the ability distribution she falls and the effective wages that clear the social market. Second, since <b>social</b> <b>wages</b> and a student’s comparative advantage are typically unobserved, the theory implies that important determinants of individual choice operate through the error term and may, even under random assignment, be correlated with the regressor of interest.
