5|$|The {{following}} table {{summarizes the}} key {{properties of the}} six quarks. Flavor quantum numbers (isospin (I3), charm (C), strangeness (<b>S,</b> <b>not</b> {{to be confused with}} spin), topness (T), and bottomness (B′)) are assigned to certain quark flavors, and denote qualities of quark-based systems and hadrons. The baryon number (B) is + for all quarks, as baryons are made of three quarks. For antiquarks, the electric charge (Q) and all flavor quantum numbers (B, I3, C, S, T, and B′) are of opposite sign. Mass and total angular momentum (J; equal to spin for point particles) do not change sign for the antiquarks.|$|E
5|$|In the Olympic 100 m final, Bolt broke new ground, {{winning in}} 9.69 s (unofficially 9.683 s) with a {{reaction}} time of 0.165 s. This was an improvement upon {{his own world}} record, and he was well ahead of second-place finisher Richard Thompson, who finished in 9.89 <b>s.</b> <b>Not</b> only was the record set without a favourable wind (+0.0m/s), but he also visibly slowed down to celebrate before he finished and his shoelace was untied. Bolt's coach reported that, based upon the speed of Bolt's opening 60 m, he could have finished {{with a time of}} 9.52 s. After scientific analysis of Bolt's run by the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, Hans Eriksen and his colleagues also predicted a sub 9.60 s time. Considering factors such as Bolt's position, acceleration and velocity in comparison with second-place-finisher Thompson, the team estimated that Bolt could have finished in 9.55±0.04 s had he not slowed to celebrate before the finishing line.|$|E

25|$|Further {{examples}} of non-positively curved 2-dimensional complexes of {{groups have been}} constructed by Swiatkowski based on actions simply transitive on oriented edges and inducing a 3-fold symmetry on each triangle; in this case too the complex of groups is obtained from the regular action on the second barycentric subdivision. The simplest example, discovered earlier with Ballmann, starts from a finite group H with a symmetric set of generators <b>S,</b> <b>not</b> containing the identity, such that the corresponding Cayley graph has girth at least 6. The associated group is generated by H and an involution τ subject to (τg)3 = 1 for each g in S.|$|E
25|$|The strangeness flavour {{quantum number}} <b>S</b> (<b>not</b> to be {{confused}} with spin) was noticed to go up and down along with particle mass. The higher the mass, the lower the strangeness (the more s quarks). Particles could be described with isospin projections (related to charge) and strangeness (mass) (see the uds octet and decuplet figures on the right). As other quarks were discovered, new quantum numbers were made to have similar description of udc and udb octets and decuplets. Since only the u and d mass are similar, this description of particle mass and charge in terms of isospin and flavour quantum numbers works well only for octet and decuplet made of one u, one d, and one other quark, and breaks down for the other octets and decuplets (for example, ucb octet and decuplet). If the quarks all had the same mass, their behaviour would be called symmetric, as they would all behave {{in exactly the same way}} with respect to the strong interaction. Since quarks do not have the same mass, they do not interact in the same way (exactly like an electron placed in an electric field will accelerate more than a proton placed in the same field because of its lighter mass), and the symmetry is said to be broken.|$|E

[...] The term boundary operation refers to finding or taking the boundary of a set. [...] Notations used for boundary of a set S include bd(S), fr(S), and ∂S. [...] Some authors (for example Willard, in General Topology) use the term frontier instead of boundary {{in an attempt to}} avoid confusion with the concept of boundary used in algebraic topology and manifold theory. [...] However, frontier sometimes refers to a different set, which is the set of boundary points which are not actually in the set; that is, S\S.|$|E
