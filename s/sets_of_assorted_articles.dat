40|$|Abstract — A service-oriented {{software}} solution to flexibly support changing business environments requires {{the existence of}} an adaptable management support system. Decoupling management processes from concrete tools by encapsulating needed management functionality into management services can help meet this requirement. However, creating management solutions is a difficult and challenging task. Due to the complexity of domain management, a formal approach based on a domain model and assorted design rules would help to increase the stability of engineered solutions. Existing approaches tend to gather only at the tools level, while neglecting process requirements, which result in solutions that are hard to adapt. In this paper, we discuss the value of domain modeling to address this situation and demonstrate how designing management services by using a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>assorted</b> design rules can be achieved. This approach is exemplified within a concrete incident management scenario. Keywords- domain-driven design; service design; management service; incident management I...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Molecular {{diversity}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in modern drug discovery against phenotypic or enzyme-based targets using high throughput screening technology. Under the auspices of the Pilot Scale Library Program of the NIH Roadmap Initiative, we produced and report herein a diverse library of 181 purine, pyrimidine, and 1, 2, 4 -triazole-N-acetamide analogues which were prepared in a parallel high throughput solution-phase reaction format. A <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>assorted</b> amines were reacted with several nucleic acid N-acetic acids utilizing HATU as the coupling reagent to produce diverse acyclic nucleoside N-acetamide analogues. These reactions were performed using 24 well reaction blocks and an automatic reagent-dispensing platform under inert atmosphere. The targeted compounds were purified on an automated purification system using solid sample loading prepacked cartridges and prepacked silica gel columns. All compounds were characterized by NMR and HRMS, and were analyzed for purity by HPLC before submission to the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) at NIH. Initial screening through the Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network (MLPCN) program, indicates that several analogues showed diverse and interesting biological activities...|$|R

From reading some of the correspondence between Justices Brandeis and Frankfurter, biographies <b>of</b> each, and <b>assorted</b> <b>articles</b> about them and the times in which they lived, I envision the following exchanges between Brandeis and Frankfurter: The year was 1914. A young law professor, Felix Frankfurter, went to one of his mentors, Louis Brandeis, for advice. Frankfurter had just been offered a teaching position at Harvard Law School but was unsure about whether to accept it. Some people from whom he had sought guidance, such as Henry Stimson and Oliver Wendell Holmes, had urged him to decline it in favor of a career in government. Moreover, the salary was small—ranging from 6, 000 to 10, 000 per year—and Frankfurter was not wealthy. Finally, he had doubts about his scholarly abilities...|$|R

40|$|Present study {{analyzes}} {{the significance of}} the scientific publication about the benefits of marine weather for the healing of several childhood diseases. The practical implementation of water and the marine environment took place in children´s sanatoriums and floating schools ships. The first center was set up in England, expanding to throughout the nineteenth century and the first third of the twentieth century around Europe and America. France, Italy and Germany stood out to introduce a large network of schools ships for the weakest children. This treatment was received by the sickest children or more predisposed from the lower social classes. The aim of reducing the high rates of child mortality and improve the health of poor children was reached effectively and gradually. The combination to manage health and educational activities to the patients admitted was materialized in the fulfillment of a schedule, on the learning <b>of</b> a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> hygienic standards, <b>assorted</b> games, baths, storybook reading and rudimentary teaching of the deed and reading. </p...|$|R
