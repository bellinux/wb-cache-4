40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} is to examine and evaluate the swift growth in surplus steel production capacity and international supply chain integration, the effects of steel manufacturing on U. S. employment, raising imports of unfairly traded steel and steel goods, and the global steel sector’s <b>structural</b> <b>overcapacity.</b> This paper {{contributes to the literature}} by providing evidence on the mechanisms forming the foundation of the first-rate productivity growth in the U. S. steel industry, models of growth in the international steel supply chains, and the advantages of adequate trade remedy implementation for the U. S. steel sector...|$|E
30|$|While dairy {{production}} is primarily pasture based {{there is increasing}} use of supplementary feeding and irrigation to reduce the impact of climate and to increase production. In contrast, New Zealand meat {{production is}} primarily produced on un-irrigated pastures with little use of supplements. This enables low cost, year-round outdoor grazing that produces natural, high quality meat products. It also means that production is highly seasonal with significant variation due to the climate (McLeod et al. 2011; Bensemann et al. 2011). Changes in pasture supply, driven by variations in temperature and rainfall {{play an important role}} in supply chain dynamics, affecting price, quality and timing of supply (Bensemann et al. 2011). This is compounded by seasonal and <b>structural</b> <b>overcapacity</b> in the meat processing industry, creating a highly competitive environment for procurement of supply.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} EU-China relations {{with regard to}} two key renewable energy sectors, wind and solar. It finds that, {{although there have been}} sources for trade disputes in both sectors, trade frictions have surfaced most prominently in the solar sector. The reason is a double imbalance between the manufacturing and deployment of solar panels, both geographically (with China producing the bulk of solar panels almost exclusively for export) and numerically (with <b>structural</b> <b>overcapacity).</b> Yet, the image of a zero-sum bilateral trade war over solar panels is exaggerated, because there are both opponents and proponents of trade defense measures in China and the EU. The study further argues that the solar dispute {{is part and parcel of}} a global wave of clean energy trade frictions and it explores pathways to settle the issue through the negotiation of a multilateral agreement on environmental goods and services...|$|E
40|$|This article {{argues that}} the fishing industry's <b>structural</b> problem of <b>overcapacity</b> affects the marine {{environment}} just as other uses of the sea affect the fishing industry. A totally free market cannot solve the problems equitably. The industry consequently needs sensitive management {{if it is to}} have a future. The CFP is the framework for Community fishermen. Measures are designed {{to meet the needs of}} the different fishing communities; ITCs do not offer a solution in this context. The detailed implementation of the policy is largely delegated to governments or to local authorities. ...|$|R
40|$|The European {{automotive}} {{industry has been}} fiercely hit by the recent economic downturn, which has further emphasized the <b>structural</b> <b>overcapacity</b> of production plants and price competition in the sales of new vehicles. Services constitute the main means for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), authorised dealers, and repair shops, {{as well as the}} independent actors, to survive and be profitable, thanks to the size and age of the vehicle fleet. Servitization is thus a strategy pursued by manufacturers and their networks. However, the offering is still dominated by transactional, product-oriented services. Moreover, the relevance of services is still not fully recognized by the service network, which is not completely aware of the impact of servitization on profitability and customer loyalty. In addition, end customers are often not aware of the full range of services available. Further, the perceived importance of services by the network and the final customers may differ. At the forefront of servitization are noteworthy experimentations of sustainable mobility solutions that improve environmental impact and quality of life. These are the forerunners of new business models dominated by result-oriented services, where customer get access to vehicles on-demand rather than through direct ownership...|$|E
40|$|The adverse {{economic}} situation the Flemish fisheries sector is {{largely due to}} <b>structural</b> <b>overcapacity.</b> Late 2005, the fleet consisted of 121 fishing vessels (123 fishing licences) mainly focused on flatfish species (beam trawl). As a result of the strong decline in total allowable catches (TACs) these past years - combined with the high fuel cost - the fleet can no longer fish in a profitable way. Currently, the Belgian fisheries sector suffers huge economic losses and partially even has a negative cash flow. Based on the reasoning that the receipts of the vessels increase on average to the extent that capacity is withdrawn from the fleet, it can be estimated how many vessels were in surplus to have the fleet operate on an overall break-even level: this could be translated into an overcapacity of 5 small and 9 large vessels. However, such estimates strongly depend on the hypotheses used, namely the evolution of the fuel price and of the TACs. The aforementioned scenario starts from a 2 % decrease in the TACs (from 2005 to 2006) and a constant fuel price of 0. 42 €/l, which is the price of October 2005. For example: a transition to another European management system of the TACs, namely to MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield) might cause the TACs to fall by another 30 % in the next five years...|$|E
