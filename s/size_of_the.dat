40|$|The {{growth and}} {{survival}} of pathogenic and nonpathogenic Pseudomonas syringae strains and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonpathogenic species Pantoea agglomerans, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Methylobacterium organophilum were compared in <b>the</b> phyllosphere <b>of</b> bean. In general, the plant pathogens survived better than the nonpathogens on leaves under environmental stress. <b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total leaf-associated populations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pathogenic P. syringae strains were greater than <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total leaf-associated populations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonpathogens under dry conditions but not under moist conditions. In these studies the surface sterilants hydrogen peroxide and UV irradiation were used to differentiate cells that were fully exposed on the surface from nonexposed cells that were in “protected sites” that were inaccessible to these agents. In general, the population sizes in protected sites increased with time after inoculation <b>of</b> plants. <b>The</b> proportion <b>of</b> bacteria on leaves that were in protected sites was generally greater for pathogens than for nonpathogens and was greater under dry conditions than under moist conditions. When organisms were vacuum infiltrated into leaves, <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonexposed “internal” populations were greater for pathogenic P. syringae strains than for nonpathogenic P. syringae strains. <b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> populations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonpathogenic species failed to increase or even decreased. <b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> nonexposed populations following spray inoculation were correlated with <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> nonexposed, internal populations which developed after vacuum infiltration and incubation. While <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> populations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pathogenic P. syringae strains increased on leaves under dry conditions, <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> populations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonpathogenic strains <b>of</b> P. syringae, P. agglomerans, and S. maltophilia decreased when the organisms were applied to plants. <b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> populations on dry leaves were also correlated with <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonexposed populations that developed following vacuum infiltration. Although pathogenicity was not required for growth in the phyllosphere under high-relative-humidity conditions, pathogenicity apparently {{was involved in the}} ability to access and/or multiply in certain protected sites in the phyllosphere and in growth on dry leaves...|$|R

5|$|Andromeda {{is one of}} the 48 constellations {{listed by}} the 2nd-century Greco-Roman {{astronomer}} Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Located north of the celestial equator, it is named for Andromeda, daughter of Cassiopeia, in the Greek myth, who was chained to a rock to be eaten by the sea monster Cetus. Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with several other constellations named for characters in the Perseus myth. Because of its northern declination, Andromeda is visible only north of 40° south latitude; for observers farther south it lies below the horizon. It {{is one of the}} largest constellations, with an area of 722 square degrees. This is over 1,400 times the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full moon, 55% of the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest constellation, Hydra, and over 10 times the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smallest constellation, Crux.|$|E

5|$|Australia's {{role in the}} Pacific War {{declined}} from 1944. The increasing <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to reduce the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armed forces to boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late 1944, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there. In May 1945, I Corps, the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign, which continued {{until the end of}} the war. These campaigns contributed little to Japan's defeat and remain controversial.|$|E
