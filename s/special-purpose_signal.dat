40|$|High {{precision}} in hydroacoustic {{instruments for}} fisheries research demands high precision and reliability {{in the test}} instruments. To simplify the test measurements, a special test unit has been developed. The operating principles are described, and a technical description is given for this <b>special-purpose</b> <b>signal</b> generator. Application of the unit is described in detail, and {{an easy way to}} verify the accuracy of signal amplitude and frequency is recommended. Finally a computational example to derive correction factors is given...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} <b>special-purpose</b> <b>signal</b> processor for performing two-dimensional convolution {{with a minimum}} amount of hardware using the concepts of singular value decomposition (SVD) and small generating kernel (SGK) convolution. The SVD of an impulse response of a two-dimensional finite impulse response (FIR) filter is employed to decompose a filter into a sum of two-dimensional separable linear operators. These linear operators are themselves decomposed into a sequence of small kernel convolution operators. The SVD expansion can be truncated to a relatively few terms without significantly affecting the filter output. ❧ A statistical analysis of finite word-length effects in SVD/SGK convolution is presented. Two important issues, related {{to the implementation of}} the filters in cascade form, scaling and section ordering, are also considered. ❧ Computer simulation of image convolution indicates that 12 bits are required for the SGK/SVD accumulator memory and 16 bits are required for quantization of filter coefficients to obtain results visually indistinguishable from full precision computation. A normalized mean square error between the SVD/SGK processed output and the direct processed output is chosen as an objective criterion function. It is shown that a subjective visual improvement is obtained by resetting the output mean to be equal to the input mean. ❧ The transformation technique developed for the one-dimensional case is used to parametrically modify the cutoff frequency of a baseline SVD/SGK convolution filter. A detailed discussion of the one-dimensional case is presented,and its applicability to SVD/SGK convolution filters is described...|$|E
50|$|More recently, raising {{transmit}} error outside {{frame transmission}} {{is used to}} indicate the transmit data lines are being used for <b>special-purpose</b> <b>signalling.</b> Specifically, the data value 0b0001 (held continuously with TX_EN low and TX_ER high) is used to request an EEE-capable PHY to enter low power mode.|$|R
50|$|SDR is an {{important}} element of SDMN, because it replaces protocol-specific radio hardware with protocol-agnostic digital transceivers.While many earlier digital radio systems used field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or <b>special-purposed</b> digital <b>signal</b> processors (DSPs) for calculations on baseband radio waveforms, the SDMN approach moves all of the baseband processing into general-purpose CPUs.SDMN radio systems also use hardware with publicly-documented interfaces that is designed to be readily reproducible by multiple manufacturers.|$|R

40|$|The design {{concept and}} {{characteristics}} of a self-contained microprocessor-based Global Positioning System time transfer receiver is described. A prototype of this unit is currently in the test phase. It employs two-bit digital baseband correlation rather than analog IF correlation of the signals with the reference code. The correlator, numerically controlled oscillators and code generator are implemented in a <b>special-purpose</b> digital <b>signal</b> processor. The time is recovered in the digital code tracking loop, and final corrections are applied in the control processor. Other features of this design are: (1) drift-free digital mechanization; (2) high reliability of digital circuits; (3) flexible control capability of the microprocessor; and (4) potential for {{a high degree of}} digital VLSI chip development leading to compact, low-cost units...|$|R
40|$|Two {{complementary}} search strategies, a Targeted Search and a Sky Survey, {{are part}} of NASA's SETI microwave observing project scheduled to begin in October of 1992. The current progress {{in the development of}} hardware and software elements of the JPL Sky Survey data processing system are presented. While the Targeted Search stresses sensitivity allowing the detection of either continuous or pulsed signals over the 1 - 3 GHz frequency range, the Sky Survey gives up sensitivity to survey the 99 percent of the sky that is not covered by the Targeted Search. The Sky Survey spans a larger frequency range from 1 - 10 GHz. The two searches will deploy <b>special-purpose</b> digital <b>signal</b> processing equipment designed and built to automate the observing and data processing activities. A two-million channel digital wideband spectrum analyzer and a signal processor system will serve as a prototype for the SETI Sky Survey processor. The design will permit future expansion to meet the SETI requirement that the processor concurrently search for left and right circularly polarized signals...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{broadband}} systems {{based on}} Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) are {{being introduced to}} meet demands for high data transfer rates. In multiple users systems, the available bandwidth has to be shared efficiently by several users. The radio channel quality will fluctuate, or fade, as users move. Fading complicates the resource allocation, but channel prediction may alleviate this problem. A flexible and computationally inexpensive state space representation of fading channels is here {{used in conjunction with}} a Kalman filter, operating on <b>special-purpose</b> reference <b>signals,</b> to track and predict fading OFDM channels. The thesis investigates key design and performance aspects of such estimators. Taking a probabilistic approach, we interpret the output of the Kalman filter as a full representation of a state of knowledge about the fading channels, given whatever information is at hand. For systems analysis, this permits conclusions to be drawn about channel estimation and prediction performance based on only vague information about the fading characteristics of the channel rather than on actual channel measurements. This is an alternative to conducting classic simulation studies. Various reference signal designs are studied and good design choices are recommended. Superimposed reference signal schemes are also proposed for an...|$|R
