5000|$|A golden {{parachute}} is {{an agreement between}} a company and an employee (usually upper executive) specifying that the employee will receive certain significant benefits if employment is terminated. Most definitions specify the employment termination is {{as a result of}} a merger or takeover, also known as [...] "Change-in-control benefits", but more recently the term has been used to describe perceived excessive CEO (and other executives) severance packages unrelated to change in ownership (also known as a golden handshake). [...] The benefits may include <b>severance</b> pay, cash <b>bonuses,</b> stock options, or other benefits.|$|R
5000|$|Two days later, {{a company}} insider posted a [...] "confession" [...] {{to the social}} network Whisper asserting that the reasons for Charney's {{dismissal}} were [...] "purely financial ... Everything else is bullshit. The board has nothing new." [...] BuzzFeed {{got in touch with}} the poster through Whisper and was able to obtain the board's dismissal letter to Charney. It repeated the board's earlier allegation that he had allowed a subordinate to pose as Morales on a blog and make sexually provocative posts to him, which had apparently led to major punitive damages awarded to Morales by the arbitrator, calling this a breach of his fiduciary duty. Further in that vein, the board said, it head learned of an attempt to possibly suborn perjury in a [...] "pending litigation matter". The letter also charged Charney with misusing corporate assets for personal gain, such as paying lucrative <b>severance</b> packages, <b>bonuses</b> and salary increases in exchange for silence from putative accusers as well as using corporate apartments himself and buying travel for family members with company funds, violating company policy by refusing to attend mandatory sexual harassment training sessions and disrupting them when others attended.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{implicit}} contracts framework {{to allow for}} on-the-job search. It is shown that involuntary unemployment can arise in such a framework without placing any a priori restrictions on either wages or severance payments. The model also implies that firms will practice a two-tier system of adjusting their labor force. In the first stage, workers who receive outside job offers leave the firm. The second stage consists of firms hiring additional workers during good states of nature, and laying off workers during bad states of nature. Furthermore, during "bad enough" states of nature, firms will offer a <b>severance</b> payment or <b>bonus</b> {{for those who want}} to voluntarily leave, and then lay off workers without offering a large enough severance payment to compensate them for being unemployed.
