5|$|Smooth Meadow-grass and Broad-leaved Meadow-grass are {{widespread}} in damp lowland conditions, Wood <b>Sedge</b> (Carex sylvatica) in woodlands, and Oval <b>Sedge</b> and Early Hair-grass on upland moors. In damp conditions Phragmites reeds and {{several species of}} Juncus are found abundantly including Jointed Rush, Soft Rush and Toad Rush, and less commonly the introduced species Slender Rush. Common Cottongrass is a familiar site on marshy land, but Saltmarsh <b>Sedge</b> (Carex salina) was only discovered {{for the first time}} in 2004 at the head of Loch Duich.|$|E
5|$|Ciomadul {{is covered}} by beech and spruce forests. Around St. Ana lake, the {{vegetation}} is mostly formed by Fagus sylvatica (common beech) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) woods. Other trees include Acer platanoides (Norway maple), Betula pendula (silver birch), Carpinus betulus (common hornbeam), Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), Salix caprea (goat willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow). A fen contains Carex lasiocarpa (slender <b>sedge),</b> Carex rostrata (bottle <b>sedge),</b> Lysimachia thyrsiflora (tufted loosestrife) and Sphagnum angustifolium (fine bogmoss). At Mohos, vegetation consists of Alnus glutinosa (common alder), Betula pendula and Salix. The peat bog contains trees (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens (downy birch)) and Ericaceae.|$|E

5000|$|Carex {{is a vast}} genus {{of almost}} 2,000 species of grassy plants in the family Cyperaceae, {{commonly}} known as <b>sedges</b> (or seg, in older books). Other members of the Cyperaceae family are also called <b>sedges,</b> however those of genus Carex may be called [...] "true" [...] <b>sedges,</b> {{and it is the}} most species-rich genus in the family. The study of Carex is known as caricology.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{commonly}} called [...] "grasses", seagrasses, rushes, and <b>sedges</b> fall outside this family. The rushes and <b>sedges</b> {{are related to}} the Poaceae, being members of the order Poales, but the seagrasses are members of order Alismatales.|$|R
5|$|Alpine plants usually {{occur in}} {{communities}} spaced between barren talus slopes. Cushion-shaped Diapensia lapponica usually grows in {{communities in the}} windiest areas, and in less exposed sites <b>sedge,</b> heath, snowbank, and alpine bog communities can be found.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{begins its}} breeding season {{later in the}} year than any other finch and later than any other native North American bird, besides occasionally the <b>sedge</b> wren. This {{may be related to the}} abundance of seeds in the late summer months, as seeds represent the majority of their diet.|$|E
5|$|The park hosts a {{wide range}} of upland and wetland vegetation. Algae and {{intertidal}} plants {{can be found at the}} shore including salt meadow grass, <b>sedge,</b> and sphagnum moss; the park's swampy areas have red maple and tulip trees; the upland sections include cherry, hickory, and shrubs.|$|E

5|$|Five {{species of}} shrubs {{grow in the}} {{vicinity}} of Mahoning Creek, its floodplain, and the nearby slopes: smooth alder, silky dogwood, gray dogwood, spicebush, and American elderberry. 11 herb species also grow in this location. These include skunk cabbage, bloodroot, sensitive fern, <b>sedge,</b> wood anemone, woolgrass, and others. There are also invasive plants such as multiflora rose, Japanese knotweed, and garlic mustard in the area.|$|E
5|$|Other {{breeding}} birds include ringed plovers and Eurasian oystercatchers {{in the sand}} dunes, and water rails in the reed bed. <b>Sedge,</b> reed and Cetti's warblers all nest in the wetland, and little egrets are now common on the reserve. In early summer, scarcer migrants like the little gull, black tern, Eurasian spoonbills and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} reed bed specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, and the island-nesting avocet. Other birds nesting in the wetland include northern lapwing, common redshank and <b>sedge,</b> reed and Cetti's warblers. Eurasian spoonbills, ruffs and black-tailed godwits are present {{for much of the}} year, and a pair of little egrets bred {{for the first time in}} 2010–2012.|$|E

50|$|He was a {{specialist}} in regards to tropical Cyperaceae (<b>sedges),</b> especially plants native to Madagascar. He also published works on <b>sedges</b> found in Senegal, Gabon, the Comoros, Belgian Congo and Ubangi-Shari. Plants with the specific epithet of chermezonii commemorate his name, an example being Carex chermezonii (Luceño & Martín-Bravo).|$|R
5|$|Within {{the forest}} habitat, the red-winged fairywren prefers wetter gullies and {{riverside}} sword <b>sedge</b> (Lepidosperma effusum). It borders {{the range of}} the variegated fairywren on the northern limit of its range, and the blue-breasted fairywren in the eastern limit, with the latter two species occupying dryer scrub while the red-winged fairywren is restricted to wetter forests. The lack of intermediate forms reinforces the status of all three taxa as separate species.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are {{omnivorous}} and forage in {{wetlands and}} saltwater marshes. They tear up {{the ground with}} their powerful beaks in search of bulbs and edible roots. Northern populations mainly eat tubers of the bulkuru <b>sedge</b> (Eleocharis dulcis) which they extract by digging holes in the mud, {{but these are not}} available south of Brisbane. They also eat the shoots and leaves of wetland and upland plants, cereal grains, seeds, insects, mollusks, crustaceans, frogs and lizards. In saltwater marshes they may drink saline water and they have glands near their eyes through which they can excrete excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, {{perennial}} <b>sedge,</b> able {{to endure}} {{in a variety}} of environments in the temperate, subarctic and arctic regions of Earth. Unlike Gossypium, the genus from which cotton is derived, the bristles which grow on E.angustifolium are unsuited to textile manufacturing. Nevertheless, in Northern Europe, they were used as a substitute in the production of paper, pillows, candle-wicks, and wound-dressings. The indigenous peoples of North America use the plant in cooking and in the treatment of digestive problems. Following a vote in 2002, Plantlife International designated E.angustifolium the County Flower of Greater Manchester, as part of its British County Flowers campaign.|$|E

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium, {{commonly}} known as common cottongrass or common cottonsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the <b>sedge</b> family Cyperaceae. Native to North America, North Asia, and Northern Europe, it grows on peat or acidic soils, in open wetland, heath or moorland. It begins to flower in April or May and, after fertilisation in early summer, the small, unremarkable brown and green flowers develop distinctive white bristle-like seed-heads that resemble tufts of cotton; combined with its ecological suitability to bog, these characteristics give rise to the plant's alternative name, bog cotton.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand <b>sedge</b> are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid, lesser centaury and carline thistle flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare Jersey cudweed and grey hair-grass are also found. The narrow 5-km (3-mi) belt of pines shelters creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest.|$|E
5|$|The chief threats {{faced by}} the brolga, {{particularly}} {{in the southern part}} of its range, are habitat destruction, the drainage of wetlands, collision with powerlines, and predation by the introduced red fox. It is more secure in its northern habitat as the land is mostly unsuitable for farming and much of it is in national parks or private ownership, but changes in vegetation cover, encouraged by the rooting activities of feral pigs, may reduce the abundance of bulkuru <b>sedge</b> and may make the brolga more vulnerable by providing cover for predators.|$|E

5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} for some scarce breeding birds, such as pied avocets on the islands, and western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds. To encourage bitterns to breed, the reed beds have been improved to make them wetter, and the lagoon has been stocked with the common rudd. Typical wetland birds such as the water rail, reed warbler and <b>sedge</b> warbler also appear, and little egrets are common. The reserve has regularly attracted rarities, as its location {{is important for}} migrating birds. Ducks and geese winter at Titchwell in considerable numbers, and the reserve shelters the endangered European water vole.|$|E
5|$|The two subcommunities of MG5, characterised by species rich {{grassland}} form a belt {{across the}} site, {{but they do}} not cover the whole site. Towards the north there is a community dominated by False oat-grass (Arrhenatherum elatius), a constant species in the MG1 and MG2 communities of the British NVC and therefore not typical of an MG5 community. At Whitton Bridge Pasture it is growing on alluvial soils located at the northern edge of the site, which have most likely been formed by Whitton Beck just to the north. A number of springs at the site are associated with flushes of the Pale <b>sedge</b> (Carex pallescens), which form small populations.|$|E
5|$|Caddisflies {{are called}} sedges by anglers. Individual species emerge en masse at {{different}} times, {{and are used}} one after the other, often {{for only a few}} days each year, as models for artificial fishing flies for fly fishing in trout streams. A mass emergence is known as a hatch. Each type has its own angling name, so for example Mystacides is the dancer; Sericostoma the caperer; Leptocerus the silverhorn; Phryganea the murragh or great red sedge; Brachycentrus subnubilis the grannom; Lepidostoma the silver sedge; Oecetis the longhorn sedge; Cheumatopsyche the little sister sedge; Helicopsyche the speckled Peter, an important fishing fly in North America; and Hydropsyche the specked <b>sedge,</b> perhaps the most important caddisfly genus for anglers with over 50 species of net-makers.|$|E
