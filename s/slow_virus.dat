40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{and limitations of}} interferon as an antiviral agent in man is exemplified by its actions against herpes simplex types 1 and 2. Given in adequate doses parenterally before or shortly after infection, interferon can ameliorate or reduce clinical manifestations or reduce the virus yield.

5000|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), {{including}} Kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob {{disease of}} humans, scrapie of sheep, and {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) of cattle, were previously classified as <b>slow</b> <b>virus</b> diseases as well. However, TSEs are more correctly classified as prion diseases. Prions are misfolded proteins that are [...] "infectious" [...] because they can induce misfolding in other previously normal proteins, but they contain no DNA or RNA so they are not viruses. [...] Before scientists knew the cause of spongiform encephalopathies, they hypothesized that small virus particles, which they termed virions, were to blame. Once {{it was discovered that}} prions were the real cause of TSEs and that prions contained no nucleic acid, the term virions was discarded and these particles were renamed prions.

50|$|Additionally, {{the immune}} system seems to plays a limited role, or no role, in {{protection}} from these slow viruses.

40|$|When two viruses {{compete for}} healthy nodes {{in a simple}} network and both {{spreading}} rates are above the epidemic threshold, only one virus will survive. However, if we prevent the viruses from dying out, rich dynamics emerge. When both viruses are identical, one virus always dominates the other, but the dominating and dominated virus alternate. We show in the complete graph that the domination time depends on {{the total number of}} infected nodes {{at the beginning of the}} domination period and, moreover, that the distribution of the domination time decays exponentially yet slowly. When the viruses differ moderately in strength and/or speed the weaker and/or <b>slower</b> <b>virus</b> can still dominate the other but for a short time. Interestingly, depending on the number of infected nodes at the start of a domination period, being quicker can be a disadvantage.

40|$|During cell entry, non-enveloped viruses undergo partial {{uncoating}} {{to expose}} membrane lytic proteins for {{gaining access to}} the cytoplasm. We report that adenovirus uses membrane piercing to induce and hijack cellular wound removal processes that facilitate further membrane disruption and infection. Incoming adenovirus stimulates calcium influx and lysosomal exocytosis, a membrane repair mechanism resulting in release of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) and degradation of sphingomyelin to ceramide lipids in the plasma membrane. Lysosomal exocytosis is triggered by small plasma membrane lesions induced by the viral membrane lytic protein-VI, which is exposed upon mechanical cues from virus receptors, followed by virus endocytosis into leaky endosomes. Chemical inhibition or RNA interference of ASMase <b>slows</b> <b>virus</b> endocytosis, inhibits virus escape to the cytosol, and reduces infection. Ceramide enhances binding of protein-VI to lipid membranes and protein-VI-induced membrane rupture. Thus, adenovirus uses a positive feedback loop between virus uncoating and lipid signaling for efficient membrane penetration...|$|R

40|$|Silica {{injections}} of mice {{have been reported}} to kill macrophages, thus allowing herpes simplex virus (HSV) to spread rapidly and leading to an increased severity of HSV infection.

Contrary to expectation, {{it was found that the}} LDV titers were increased in silica-injected mice as compared to the titers in control mice. Counts of peritoneal cells at different periods after silica injection showed that silica-induced macrophage damage in vivo resulted in proliferation and migration of macrophages, thus providing additional target cells for LDV replication and leading to high LDV titers. In vitro, silica ingestion also damaged the macrophages, but since no replacement of cells could occur by infiltration, decreased LDV titers were found. Similar findings were obtained with HSV. It is suggested that all persistent viruses multiplying in macrophages will show a similar recrudescence under comparable conditions...|$|R

40|$|Current {{knowledge}} of <b>slow</b> <b>virus</b> diseases provides {{a foundation for}} examining the possible viral etiology {{of a number of}} chronic degenerative diseases, including multifile sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and diabetes mellitus. General Comments The designation <b>slow</b> <b>virus</b> disease refers not to the causal agent but {{to the fact that the}} diseases induced have a slow, relentless-ly progressive course and a fatal termina-tion. These diseases can be divided into two categories according to whether the causal agent is a typical, conventional virus (propagable in vitro; cytopathogenic; anti-genie; associated with inflammatory le-sions, for example of the central nervous system, etc.) or a transmissible agent whose properties and behavior suggest an uncon-ventional or atypical virus. In the latter category are four of the classic <b>slow</b> <b>virus</b> diseases, namely kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease of man (Table 1) and scrapie and mink encephalopathy of animals (Table 2). The transmissible agents involved are regarded as atypical viruses because of their nature, properties, and characteristics; and, because of the similar pathologic picture they induce, they are regarded as prototypic viruses of this group, collectively referred to as the subacute spongifoorm encephalopathies. The label encephalopathy rather than encephalitis is used because the widespread destructive cerebral changes present a pic...|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{viral culture}} has been {{generally}} superseded by shell vial culture, in which the sample is centrifuged onto a single layer of cells and viral growth is measured by antigen detection methods.

40|$|A bispecific Ab (BsAb) {{that binds}} the TCR on T cells and the G protein of the {{vesicular}} stomatitis virus (VSV) can redirect staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) -activated T cells to kill VSV-infected cells and to inhibit VSV replication in vitro. Inhibition of virus replication {{in our system}} is dependent upon the specificity of the Ab for the viral protein. IFN- � does not play {{a very important role}} in this phenomenon, which is mainly mediated by the release of Pfp from CD 8 � T cells. We have used a Stat 1 knockout mouse model in which VSV infection is lethal. Infusion of staphylococcal enterotoxin-activated B T cells and bispecific Ab significantly <b>slowed</b> <b>virus</b> progression and prolonged the survival of VSV-infected Stat 1 knockout mice in vivo. The Journal of Immunology, 1998, 160 : 1841 – 1849. In many virus infections, T cells have been shown to {{play a crucial role in}} recovery, whereas Abs predominantly protect against reinfection (1). The demonstrated requirements for costimulatory molecules suggest that activation of virus-specific T cells may depend on presentation by professional APC (2).

The activation step takes a few days, allowing virus replication and invasio...|$|R
40|$|The flavivirus nonstructural protein NS 1 {{has been}} implicated in viral RNA replication, {{although}} its precise role has not been identified. In its native slate NS 1 exists as a heat labile homodimer that {{is thought to be}} required for NS 1 function and secretion. However, we have recently identified a cDNA clone of KUN virus (FLSD) that replicates efficiently in cell culture but produces and secretes NS 1 in monomeric form. Sequence analysis of the NS 1 gene in FLSD revealed a single amino acid substitution (proline(250) to leucine) when compared with the parental KUN virus. When site-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute leucine(250) with proline in FLSD to produce the clone 250 pro, dimerisation was fully restored. Furthermore, time course experiments revealed that 250 pro replicated in Vero cells significantly faster than FLSD and produced 100 -fold more infectious virus early (12 - 24 h) in infection. This correlated with our observations that FLSD required approximately IO-fold more infectious virus than 250 pro to produce disease in weanling mice after intraperitoneal inoculation. Taken together our results indicate that mutation from proline to leucine at residue 250 in KUN NS 1 ablates dimer formation, <b>slows</b> <b>virus</b> replication, and reduces virulence in mice.

40|$|International audienceAbstractPiscine {{orthoreovirus}} (PRV) is a ubiquitous {{virus in}} Norwegian salmon farms {{associated with the}} disease heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI). Experimental challenge {{has shown that the}} virus replicates in circulating red blood cells of Atlantic salmon prior to infecting heart myocytes. The infection route from water to blood is however still unknown. The related mammalian orthoreovirus primarily infects the lungs and gastrointestinal (GI) tract and is proposed to spread mainly through the faecal–oral route. To investigate the role of the salmonid GI tract in PRV-infection, oral and anal administration of virus was compared to intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection. When administered anally, PRV was transferred to blood 4  days post challenge (dpc) and levels peaked at 42 dpc, similar to i. p. injected fish. PRV was detected in heart and faeces with corresponding kinetics, and inflammatory heart lesions consistent with HSMI were observed from 49 dpc. The orally intubated group showed <b>slower</b> <b>virus</b> kinetics in both blood and heart, and no signs of HSMI. Compared to the oral and i. p. administration routes, leakage of virus inoculate by anal intubation was minor and challenge was restricted to the mid- and distal intestine. These findings show that anal intubation is an efficacious method for PRV delivery to the GI tract and demonstrates that PRV can establish infection through the intestine with the potential for transmission via faeces...|$|R
40|$|Two doubled-haploid rice populations, IR 64 /Azucena and IRAT 177 /Apura, {{were used}} to {{identify}} markers linked to rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) resistance using core {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) maps. Resistance was measured by mechanical inoculation of 19 -day-old seedlings followed by assessment of virus content by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests 15 days after inoculation. IR 64 /Azucena and IRAT 177 /Apura populations, 72 and 43 lines, respectively, were evaluated, and resistance was found to be polygenic. Resistance was expressed as a <b>slower</b> <b>virus</b> multiplication, low symptom expression, and limited yield loss when assessed at the field level. Bulked segregant analysis using the IR 64 /Azucena population identified a single random amplified polymorphic DNA marker that mapped on chromosome 12 and corresponded to a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) evidenced by interval mapping. When pooling RFLP data, integrated mapping of this chromosome revealed that the QTL was common to the two populations and corresponded to a small chromosomal segment known to contain a cluster of major blast resistance genes. This region of the genome also reflected the differentiation observed at the RFLP level between the subspecies #indica$ and #japonica$ of #Oryza sativa$. This is consistent with the observation that most sources of RYMV resistance used in rice breeding are found in upland rice varieties that typically belong to the #japonica$ subspecies.
