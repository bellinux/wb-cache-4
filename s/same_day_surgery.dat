40|$|The term surgery {{scheduling}} is used about {{a variety}} of strategic, tactical and operational scheduling problems, {{many of which are}} critical to an efficient use of hospital resources. Our focus is on operational surgery scheduling problems, which are often NP-hard. The exact problem formulation varies substantially among hospitals, or even hospital departments. In addition, the level of detail vary between different planning situations, ranging from long term patient admission planning to a very detailed planning of the <b>same</b> <b>day's</b> <b>surgeries.</b> This diversity makes it difficult to design scheduling methods and software solutions that are applicable {{to a wide range of}} surgery scheduling problems, without extensive customization for each individual application. We approach this challenge by proposing a new generalised model for surgery scheduling problems. The problem can be seen as a rich extension to the resource-constrained project scheduling problem, and we present a structured overview of how our contribution relates to the existing project scheduling literature. We represent this problem by extending the classical disjunctive graph model developed for jobshop scheduling problems. To investigate the power of exact optimization methods in solving generalised surgery scheduling problems, we formulate this disjunctive model as a Mixed Integer Linear Program and solve it by means of a commercial solver. The results show that while it is not capable of solving realistic instances to optimality, the formulation produces good bounds, and promising results were found for interesting sub problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{increasing}} demand on hospitalisation, either due to elective activity from the waiting lists or due to emergency admissions {{coming from the}} Emergency Department (ED), requires looking for strategies that lead to effective bed management. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of a surgery admission unit for major elective surgery patients who were admitted for same-day surgery. Methods We included all patients admitted for elective surgery in a university tertiary hospital between the 1 st of September and the 31 st of December 2006, as well as those admitted during the same period of 2008, after the introduction of the Surgery Admission Unit. The main outcome parameters were global length of stay, pre-surgery length of stay, proportion of patients admitted the <b>same</b> <b>day</b> of the <b>surgery</b> and number of cancellations. Differences between the two periods were evaluated by the T-test and Chi-square test. Significance at P Results We included 6, 053 patients, 3, 003 during 2006 and 3, 050 patients during 2008. Global length of stay was 6. 2 days (IC 95 %: 6. 4 - 6) in 2006 and 5. 5 days (IC 95 %: 5. 8 - 5. 2) in 2008 (p Conclusions The implementation of a Surgery Admission Unit for patients undergoing major elective surgery has proved to be an effective strategy for improving bed management. It has enabled an improvement in the proportion of patients admitted on the <b>same</b> <b>day</b> as <b>surgery</b> and a shorter length of stay. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMany reasons {{have helped}} to achieve the {{expansion}} of <b>day</b> <b>surgery</b> in health care system. First, surgical and pharmacological advances have dramatically reduced length of hospitalizazion needed for recovery from anaesthesia and operation. Second, <b>day</b> <b>surgery</b> {{has the potential to}} be more cost-effective than inpatient surgery. Third, patients generally are satisfied with <b>day</b> <b>surgery</b> because they have no or minimal side effects, are discharged the <b>same</b> <b>day</b> they have <b>surgery</b> and there is a minimal disruption in their everyday life. In this new era of safe, efficient, convenient, economical and speedy surgical interventions and minimal hospital stay, considerable attention must be given to some psychological issues, as anxiety and its management and information provision. Several studies have highlighted causes and degree of anxiety experienced by patients admitted in <b>day</b> <b>surgery</b> and a lack of an adequate and documented support. A combination of consistent strategies and interpersonal skills may have the potential to become the base of a formal psychoeducational plan implemented to manage anxiety. An essential component of anxiety management is information provision. Since lack or inadequacy of information is one of the main complaints with <b>day</b> <b>surgery</b> and the most common cause of patients' dissatisfaction, a formal and structured programme of information delivery is required. The timely and appropriate provision of different levels of information tailored to patient's coping styles and preferences has been strongly recommended. The information provided must cover the whole range of procedural, behavioural and sensory information and include pre-operative, operative and post-operative phases...|$|R
