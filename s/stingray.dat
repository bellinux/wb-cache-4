5|$|Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} morphology, {{found that the}} pelagic <b>stingray</b> {{is one of the}} more basal members of its family, being the sister taxon to a clade that {{contains}} Pastinachus, Dasyatis, and Indo-Pacific Himantura species. Other common names for the pelagic <b>stingray</b> include the blue <b>stingray</b> and the violet <b>stingray.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Lisa Rosenberger {{published}} a phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphology. The common <b>stingray</b> {{was reported to}} be the most basal member of the genus, other than the bluespotted <b>stingray</b> (D. kuhlii) and pelagic <b>stingray</b> (D. violacea). However, D. violacea has generally been recognized as belonging to its own genus Pteroplatytrygon, and recently D. kuhlii has also been placed in a different genus, Neotrygon.|$|E
5|$|Other {{common names}} {{used for this}} species include bluespotted ray, bluespotted fantail ray, bluespotted lagoon ray, bluespotted <b>stingray,</b> fantail ray, lesser fantail ray, lagoon ray, reef ray, ribbon-tailed <b>stingray,</b> and ribbontail <b>stingray.</b> Morphological {{examination}} {{has suggested that the}} bluespotted ribbontail ray is more closely related to the amphi-American Himantura (H. pacifica and H. schmardae) and the river stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) than to the congeneric blotched fantail ray (T. meyeni), which is closer to Dasyatis and Indo-Pacific Himantura.|$|E
50|$|A merit {{team was}} {{announced}} {{at the conclusion of}} the tournament and consisted of George Edwards (Counties Manukau <b>Stingrays),</b> Joseph Oti (Wellington Orcas), Matt Sauni (Canterbury Bulls), Simione Ma’amaloa (Counties Manukau <b>Stingrays),</b> Andrew Tusiane (Counties Manukau <b>Stingrays),</b> Tevin Arona (Canterbury Bulls), Ray Talimalie (Counties Manukau <b>Stingrays),</b> Saipani Aiolupo (Counties Manukau <b>Stingrays),</b> Kruz Tupo (Counties Manukau <b>Stingrays),</b> Chris Bamford (Canterbury Bulls), Sione Feao (Counties Manukau <b>Stingrays),</b> James Baxendale (Canterbury Bulls) and Nick Read (Wai-Coa-Bay Stallions).

2500|$|The South Carolina <b>Stingrays,</b> a {{professional}} hockey team, {{plays in the}} ECHL. The <b>Stingrays</b> play in North Charleston at the North Charleston Coliseum. The <b>Stingrays</b> are an affiliate of the Washington Capitals and Hershey Bears.|$|R
5|$|The blue <b>stingray</b> (Dasyatis chrysonota) of {{southern}} Africa {{has long been}} regarded as {{a variant of the}} common <b>stingray.</b> However, the common <b>stingray</b> lacks the blue markings of the other species and differs in morphological and meristic characters, which led the latter to be definitively recognized as a separate species by Paul Cowley and Leonard Compagno in 1993. The distinction between this species and the similar Tortonese's <b>stingray</b> (D. tortonesei) of the Mediterranean is poorly understood and may not be valid, requiring further investigation.|$|E
5|$|The bluespotted <b>stingray</b> {{feeds on}} shrimp, small bony fish, mollusks, crabs and other worms. Due {{to the fact}} that this ray is a shallow bottom feeder, it has a small variety of marine life to prey on. The bluespotted <b>stingray</b> overpowers its prey by pinning them {{to the bottom of the}} {{seafloor}} with its fins. The bluespotted <b>stingray</b> has numerous tiny teeth, with the lower jaw being slightly convex. They also, like most stingrays, have plate-like teeth to crush prey.|$|E
5|$|The first {{description}} of the roughtail <b>stingray</b> was published by American naturalist Samuel Mitchell {{in one of the}} earliest North American works on ichthyology, a short treatise on the fishes of New York in the 1815 first volume of Transactions of the Literary and Philosophical Society of New York. Mitchell based his account on specimens caught off Long Island, though did not designate any types, and named the new species Raja centroura, from the Greek centoro ("pricker") in reference to its thorns. Subsequent authors moved this species to the genus Dasyatis. This ray may also be referred to as rough-tailed <b>stingray,</b> rough-tailed northern <b>stingray,</b> or thorny <b>stingray.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fitzsimmons {{found most}} of his success as a player with the South Carolina <b>Stingrays,</b> posting 24 wins in 37 games during the 1994-95 season, {{bringing}} success to the then-new hockey team. He had two more stints with the <b>Stingrays</b> following this season, before retiring {{as a player and}} becoming an assistant coach for the <b>Stingrays.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{flattened}} {{bodies of}} <b>stingrays</b> {{allow them to}} effectively conceal themselves in their environments. <b>Stingrays</b> do this by agitating the sand and hiding beneath it. Because their eyes are {{on top of their}} bodies and their mouths on the undersides, <b>stingrays</b> cannot see their prey; instead, they use smell and electroreceptors (ampullae of Lorenzini) similar to those of sharks. <b>Stingrays</b> feed primarily on molluscs, crustaceans, and occasionally on small fish. Some stingrays' mouths contain two powerful, shell-crushing plates, while other species only have sucking mouthparts. <b>Stingrays</b> settle on the bottom while feeding, often leaving only their eyes and tails visible. Coral reefs are favorite feeding grounds and are usually shared with sharks during high tide.|$|R
5000|$|The South Carolina <b>Stingrays,</b> {{of which}} Zucker was part owner, adorned their helmets with a [...] "JZ" [...] sticker; the {{practice}} continues. The team also recognized {{his contributions to}} the team and the community by inducting him into the <b>Stingrays</b> Hockey Hall of Fame on March 21, 2009. The <b>Stingrays</b> organization unveiled the Jerry Zucker Community Service award, to be given annually to the <b>Stingrays</b> player who had {{the greatest impact on}} the local community. The first to receive the award was <b>Stingrays</b> forward Spencer Carbery. The Jerry Zucker Ride for Hope, started in October 2008, provides fundraising efforts for the Livestrong foundation and also supports local charities engaged in the fight against cancer.|$|R
5|$|The species syntypes were {{collected}} from San Diego Bay, California. The specific epithet dipterura {{is derived from the}} Latin di ("two"), ptero ("wing"), and ura ("tail"), referring to the fin folds on both sides of its tail. Rat-tailed <b>stingray</b> is a former common name for this species. Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, based on morphology, determined the diamond <b>stingray</b> and the bluntnose <b>stingray</b> (D.say) of the western Atlantic Ocean to be sister species, that likely diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama (c. 3 Ma). In addition, the two were found to be the second-most basal taxa in their genus, after the common <b>stingray</b> (D.pastinaca).|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the roughtail <b>stingray</b> {{is not fully}} resolved, with the disjunct northwestern Atlantic, southwestern Atlantic, and eastern Atlantic populations differing in life history and perhaps representing a complex of different species. Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphology, found that the roughtail <b>stingray</b> is the sister species to the broad <b>stingray</b> (D. lata), and that they form a clade with the southern <b>stingray</b> (D. americana) and the longtail <b>stingray</b> (D. longa). The close relationship between the roughtail and southern stingrays was upheld by a genetic analysis published by Leticia de Almeida Leao Vaz and colleagues in 2006. The roughtail and broad stingrays {{are found in the}} Atlantic and Pacific Oceans respectively, and therefore likely diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama (c. 3 Ma).|$|E
5|$|Though not aggressive, {{the common}} <b>stingray</b> can inflict an excruciating wound with its serrated, venomous tail spine. The ancient Greeks and Romans greatly feared its venom, with authors such as Aelian (175–235 AD) stating that <b>stingray</b> wounds were incurable. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD), in his Natural History, {{asserted}} that its spine {{was capable of}} killing trees, piercing armor like an arrow, and corroding iron. Greek poet Oppian (172–210 AD) claimed that the touch of <b>stingray</b> venom could even dissolve stone. In Greek mythology, Hercules {{was said to have}} lost a finger to the bite of a <b>stingray,</b> and Circe was said to have armed her son Telegonus with a spear tipped with a <b>stingray</b> spine, with which he accidentally slew his father Odysseus.|$|E
50|$|Following their CBL {{success in}} 2010/11, the <b>Stingrays</b> applied {{to enter the}} Big V Division One {{competition}} for the 2012 season. Their Big V application was accepted, but after signing a number of big-name players, {{it was determined that}} the <b>Stingrays</b> would be competitive enough to enter the State Championship division. With their move up to the Big V, a <b>Stingrays</b> side continued to compete in the CBL in 2011/12 and 2012/13. A <b>Stingrays</b> side re-entered the CBL for the 2016/17 season after a three-year hiatus.|$|R
50|$|It {{may be that}} <b>stingrays</b> began {{gathering}} in the area decades ago when fisherman returning from an excursion, navigated behind a reef into the sound, and cleaned their fish in the calm water of the shallows and sandbar area. The fish guts and squid were thrown overboard and the <b>stingrays</b> eventually congregated to feast there. Soon the <b>stingrays</b> associated {{the sound of a}} boat engine with food. As this practice turned into a tradition, divers realized that the <b>stingrays</b> could be fed by hand.|$|R
50|$|Kiser retired {{following}} the 2010-11 ECHL season. On October 14, 2011, the South Carolina <b>Stingrays</b> inducted Kiser into the <b>Stingrays</b> Hall of Fame at the North Charleston Coliseum.|$|R
5|$|Irwin's {{death is}} {{believed}} to be the only fatality from a <b>stingray</b> ever captured on video.|$|E
5|$|Larger elasmobranchs, such as hammerhead sharks, prey on the bluespotted <b>stingray.</b> The rays {{coloration}} is {{a warning}} for the highly venomous barbs, thus few animals attempt to overpower this ray. The hammerhead shark uses its head to pin down the bluespotted <b>stingray,</b> while it is in shock and much weaker.|$|E
5|$|Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{morphological}} characters, {{found that the}} bluntnose <b>stingray</b> {{is one of the}} more basal members of its genus, and that it is a sister species to the diamond <b>stingray</b> (D.dipterura) of the western Pacific Ocean. The two species likely diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, some three million years ago.|$|E
50|$|This {{led to his}} {{professional}} debut in the 2003/04 season for the Hull <b>Stingrays,</b> then playing in the British National League. After playing twice for the <b>Stingrays,</b> he impressed enough to earn a professional contract with the <b>Stingrays</b> and would establish himself as a regular player for the team in the 2004/05 term. Boothroyd played in 62 regular season games for the <b>Stingrays,</b> helping out with 5 points along the way. Boothroyd would also make his international debut in 2004, playing for Team G.B. in the 2004 World Junior U-18 Championships on five occasions.|$|R
50|$|The South Carolina <b>Stingrays</b> led the Alaska Aces, 3-1, {{headed to}} Game 5 before blowing the lead, {{and having to}} face a Game 7, where the <b>Stingrays</b> {{clinched}} their third Kelly Cup with a 4-2 win, winning the series, 4-3. The <b>Stingrays</b> tied the ECHL record for most ECHL championships, with three. South Carolina would get their revenge on Cincinnati for defeating the <b>Stingrays</b> in the 2008 American Conference finals by sweeping the Cyclones in four games. The National Conference finals had the same results with Alaska sweeping Las Vegas in four games.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, Kiser {{moved to}} the South Carolina <b>Stingrays.</b> While with the <b>Stingrays,</b> Kiser has been called up to the AHL's Portland Pirates and Albany River Rats for 5 games and 1 game, respectively. Since joining the <b>Stingrays,</b> Kiser has earned 102 points and 992 penalty minutes in regular season play, with 11 points and 116 penalty minutes in the post-season.|$|R

5|$|Particularly {{prominent}} in the ocean waters surrounding Hilton Head Island, the <b>stingray</b> serves as a fascination and painful natural encounter for many beach goers. Small stingrays inhabit the quieter, shallow region of ocean floor just beyond the break of the surf, typically buried beneath {{a thin layer of}} sand. Stingrays are a type of demersal, cartilaginous fish common to the South Carolina coast as well as other areas on the Atlantic shoreline. Typically, stingrays avoid contact with humans unless they are accidentally stepped upon, a situation often ending in a <b>stingray</b> injury, where the <b>stingray</b> punctures the human with its poisonous barb. While these injuries are extremely painful, they are not usually life-threatening {{as long as they are}} properly attended to by a medical professional. One complaint shared by many Hilton Head Island tourists is that the lifeguards maintain a poor alert system for notifying swimmers when numerous stingrays have been sighted within a specific stretch of the shore. This lack of notification on days when multiple sightings are reported can sometimes end in a high number of <b>stingray</b> injuries that might have otherwise been avoided; in 2009, 121 people were treated for <b>stingray</b> injuries.|$|E
5|$|The bluespotted <b>stingray</b> is {{commonly}} found in waters of depths about 0–90 meters (0–295feet), being {{commonly found in}} sand and mudflats, but have also been encountered near rocky coral reefs, and sea grass beds. This <b>stingray</b> is found in a tropical climate at 29°N- 31°S, and 20°E- 171°W. At high tide the bluespotted <b>stingray</b> moves into the shallow lagoons and reef flats. It is found in northern Australia, Kenya, Madagascar, The island of Mauritius, Somalia, {{the east coast of}} South Africa, India. The bluespotted <b>stingray</b> is in almost the entire continental waters of Asia, including the Sea of Japan, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, Philippine Sea, Sulu Sea, Java Sea, Banda Sea, Celebes Sea, Andaman Sea, the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} of the Yantai <b>stingray's</b> natural history. Like other <b>stingrays,</b> it is aplacental {{viviparous}} with females probably giving birth to only 1 - 2 pups at a time.|$|R
50|$|The Rhode Island Lady <b>Stingrays</b> were a W-League club {{based in}} Providence, Rhode Island, USA, {{associated}} with the Men's USL team, the Rhode Island <b>Stingrays.</b> The team folded after the 2004 season.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, MacLean {{announced}} his retirement from professional hockey and was named the assistant coach of the <b>Stingrays</b> soon after. He helped lead the <b>Stingrays</b> to the Kelly Cup championship in 2009.|$|R
5|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, {{the giant}} {{freshwater}} <b>stingray</b> inhabits sandy or muddy areas and preys on small fishes and invertebrates. Females give live birth to litters {{of one to}} four pups, which are sustained to term by maternally produced histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species faces heavy fishing pressure for meat, recreation, and aquarium display, as well as extensive habitat degradation and fragmentation. These forces have resulted in substantial population declines in at least central Thailand and Cambodia. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the giant freshwater <b>stingray</b> as Endangered.|$|E
5|$|In {{the northwestern}} Atlantic, the roughtail <b>stingray</b> is listed under Least Concern; {{it is not}} {{targeted}} or utilized by commercial fisheries, though inconsequential numbers are captured incidentally in trawls and on demersal longlines. Historically, it was sometimes ground up for fertilizer. In the Mediterranean, intensive fishing occurs in the habitat of the roughtail <b>stingray,</b> and it is caught incidentally by artisanal and commercial fishers using trawls, longlines, gillnets, and handlines. Though no specific data is available on this species, declines of other species and its intrinsic susceptibility to depletion have led it to be assessed as Near Threatened in the region. In the southwestern Atlantic, the roughtail <b>stingray</b> and other large rays are heavily fished using demersal trawls, gillnets, longlines, and hook-and-line; this fishing pressure is liable to increase due to growing commercial interest in using large stingrays for minced fish products. Anecdotal reports suggest that landings of this species are decreasing, leading to a regional assessment of Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Irwin died on 4 September 2006 {{after being}} pierced {{in the chest}} by a <b>stingray</b> barb while filming an {{underwater}} documentary film titled Ocean's Deadliest.|$|E
50|$|During {{the opening}} {{weekend of the}} ECHL season, the league had {{a moment of silence}} for former South Carolina <b>Stingrays</b> player Mark Bavis, who had been killed in the September 11 {{terrorist}} attacks. Ryan Brindley, who was wearing #12 for the <b>Stingrays</b> in the previous season, changed to #55 after the team retired the number that Bavis had worn during his two seasons (1994-96) with the <b>Stingrays.</b>|$|R
50|$|River <b>stingrays</b> or {{freshwater}} <b>stingrays</b> are Neotropical freshwater fishes of the Potamotrygonidae {{family in}} the order Myliobatiformes, {{one of the four}} orders of batoids, cartilaginous fishes related to sharks. River <b>stingrays</b> are found in rivers in South America draining into the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean as far south as the River Plate in Argentina (freshwater <b>stingrays</b> in Africa, Asia and Australia are in another family, Dasyatidae). Each river system has its own endemic <b>stingrays.</b> A single marine genus, Styracura, of the tropical West Atlantic and East Pacific are also part of Potamotrygonidae. They are generally brownish, greyish or black, often with a mottled or speckled pattern, have disc widths ranging from 25 to(-) 200 cm and venomous tail stingers. There are more than thirty species in five genera.|$|R
50|$|Ocellate river <b>stingrays</b> are {{sometimes}} kept in captivity, with requirements {{similar to other}} members of Potamotrygon. It {{is one of the}} most popular species of freshwater <b>stingrays,</b> but require a very large tank.|$|R
