[...] He stated on different occasions that his novels all deal with the same aspect of life, that is, the dilemma when <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>you</b> have a situation such that nobody can tell you what to do.|$|E
2500|$|Musician Jack Kelson {{recalled}} {{the sidewalk in}} front of the Dunbar as the most desirable place to hang out on the city's coolest street. He said, [...] "That's my favorite spot on Central Avenue, that spot in the front of the Dunbar Hotel, because that to me was the hippest, most intimate, key spot of all the activity. [...] That's where all the night people hung out: the sportsmen, the businessmen, the dancers, everybody in show business, people who were somebody stayed at the hotel. â€¦ y far that block, that Dunbar Hotel, for me was it. [...] And it was it for, it seemed to me, everybody else. [...] <b>Sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>you</b> walked in front of that hotel, and that's where everybody congregated." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What does it matter?" [...] responded Michael, [...] "they'll chuck <b>you</b> out <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> Somehow <b>you</b> don't {{give the}} effect of being a good magistrate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My mind is made up, my old friend. Even Sergeant Cuff doesn't daunt me. By-the-bye, I {{may want}} to speak to him, <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> Have <b>you</b> heard {{anything}} of him lately?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It would matter very much. You know, you,--you; {{you know}} whom he loves. And I {{do believe that}} <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>you</b> will be his wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] {{answered}} Muriel. [...] "It {{would serve}} no purpose. But I feel that <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>you</b> will be {{sorry for what}} you have done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Carruthers {{says that}} the {{property}} must come right, <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> <b>You</b> might do better, perhaps, but you won't trouble yourself. We can't {{go on like this}} for ever, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very commendable principles! {{and such}} as {{will surely be}} the means of exalting you in the world <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later!</b> But <b>you</b> forget to answer my question: Will the passage be long, or short?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I daresay you do. Not much, however. Now, if you like, I'll {{take you}} {{over the rest of}} the school. You'll have to see it <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later,</b> so <b>you</b> may as well get it over at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{altogether}} lucky, Jake, I think. Character {{counts for}} more than fortune, and you really won success by the stubbornness you showed in the Border bogs. It would have come <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later,</b> if <b>you</b> hadn't met Hulton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I call it pure rubbish," [...] Charles answered. [...] "However, continue. Systems {{were made}} for fools--and to suit wise men. <b>Sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>you</b> must lose at such a stupid fancy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know very}} well that I mean it," [...] he answered, kissing her. [...] "I think you knew from the very first that <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>you</b> were doomed to become my wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are doing}} well indeed, Tom, but you must {{remember}} that <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>you</b> might go into a fray and lose your life, {{and with it the}} chance of buying that estate you speak of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew it {{had been}} rankling in your mind all along," [...] said the girl [...] "I {{expected}} it to coma out <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> And <b>you</b> talk about renunciation! You never forget nor forgive the slightest thing. But I don't ask your forgiveness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You men {{stay here}} {{on the island and}} take care of Miss Harding," [...] he said. [...] "If I don't come back the marines will find <b>you</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later,</b> <b>or</b> <b>you</b> can make your way to the coast, and work around toward the cove.

6000|$|... "All right, Chris; I {{shall be}} very glad {{when you have}} gone. You will get hit <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> if <b>you</b> go on firing, and I shall {{be a great deal}} more {{comfortable}} when you are once off. I don't believe they will venture across the drift; they know how straight you shoot." ...|$|R
60|$|THE SHE-ANCIENT. <b>Sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>you</b> {{will fall}} and break your neck; or a tree will fall on you; {{or you will}} be struck by lightning. Something or other must make an end of you some day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothin'," [...] he grunted. [...] "Yes, there is, too. What's the difference? You'd know it <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> <b>You</b> {{ought to}} see old Chavon. His face is that long he can't walk without bumpin' his knee on his chin. His gold-mine's peterin' out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such people," [...] said Mrs. Horn, philosophically, [...] "people {{with their}} money, must of course be {{received}} <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> <b>You</b> can't keep them out.

6000|$|... "She's {{going to}} find it out <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> I tell <b>you</b> she knows now there's {{something}} wrong out here. She's got eyes. Mark what I say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Abiram White," [...] {{said the}} squatter, when his sons had descended from {{completing}} this arrangement, [...] "I {{give you a}} last and solemn asking. Death is before you in two shapes. With this rifle can your misery be cut short, or by that cord, <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later,</b> must <b>you</b> meet your end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} be informed, I think, of the {{contents}} of this letter, for it has seriously influenced Allan's plans. He loses everything, <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later,</b> as <b>you</b> know, and he has lost the letter already. So I must give you the substance of what Mrs. Blanchard wrote to him, as plainly as I can.|$|R
6000|$|The sheriff growled surlily. [...] "All right, {{but there}} ain't no monkey {{business}} about this. I get my man <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later,</b> <b>you</b> bet your heart on that." [...] As {{he went out}} into the general office and announced the agent's demand, Green blurted out defiant phrases.|$|E
6000|$|Nasmyth raised {{himself on}} one elbow, and looked hard at her. [...] "Well," [...] he admitted, [...] "there {{was one thing}} I did not tell you, though I had meant to do so <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> <b>You</b> see, {{there was nothing to}} warrant it in the meanwhile." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't say I told you," [...] {{whispered the}} Steam, consolingly; [...] "but, {{between you and}} me and the last cloud I came from, it was bound to happen <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> <b>You</b> had to give a fraction, and you've given without knowing it. Now, hold on, as before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What is {{the meaning}} of this, Felix? You must tell me. It must be told <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> I know <b>you</b> are unhappy. You had better trust your mother.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{got to know}} it <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later,</b> so <b>you</b> {{might as}} well know it now," [...] he said in as steady a voice as he could command. [...] "Do you {{remember}} that I wrote to you about sixty-four thousand dollars' worth of bonds that I had bought for dad in place of some securities that he possessed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did he, now?" [...] {{rejoined the}} landlady, with an {{appearance}} of the greatest interest. [...] "Behaved badly to you--almost broke your heart, didn't he? Ah, it will come home to him, <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> Don't <b>you</b> fear! 'Honor your father and mother,' wasn't put on Moses's tables of stone for nothing, Mr. Bashwood. Where may he be, and {{what is he doing}} now, sir?" ...|$|R
60|$|THE SERPENT. They cannot renew {{themselves}} without Eves. <b>Sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>you</b> will die like the fawn; {{and the new}} Adams {{will be unable to}} create without new Eves. You can imagine such an end; but you cannot desire it, therefore cannot will it, therefore cannot create Adams only.|$|E
6000|$|... "Verily you may say so. But Tony Babington {{always was}} a fool, and a wrong-headed fool, who {{was sure to}} ruin himself <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> <b>You</b> {{remember}} the decoy for the wild-fowl? Well, never was silly duck or goose so ready to swim into the nets as was he!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Oakhurst (quietly). Perhaps, Jovita (taking {{her hand}} with grave earnestness), to a clandestine {{intimacy}} like ours there {{is but one}} end. It is not merely elopement, not merely marriage, it is exposure! <b>Sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> <b>you</b> and I must face the eyes we now shun. What matters if tonight or later? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{challenge}} {{your right to}} demand an account of my actions," [...] said the girl. With an evident effort to defy Thurston, she added, after a pause, [...] "But the explanation must have come <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later,</b> and <b>you</b> shall have it now. I have grown--perhaps the brutal truth is best--tired {{of you and your}} folly. You would sacrifice my future to your fantastic pride--and this man would give up everything for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no {{question}} of 'but' or of any argument," [...] said Chauvelin, {{in a tone that}} made the timid old man tremble from head to foot.

6000|$|... "Better take my advice, {{and drop}} Link Merwell," [...] said Dave, {{as the young}} man moved away. [...] "If <b>you</b> don't, <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> he'll get <b>you</b> into hot water. The {{authorities}} want him, even though they got back the things he stole." ...|$|R
