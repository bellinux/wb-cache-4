40|$|Abstract This {{study is}} aimed at {{examining}} {{the effects of the}} Know-Want-Learn (KWL) strategy on primary school students’ metacognition and physics achievement. A pre-test – post-test control group design was used, where the treatment was the implementation of the KWL strategy. A physics knowledge test and a questionnaire about metacognition were administered to sixth-grade primary school students of both genders. The results obtained were treated statistically, using descriptive statistics and a paired-samples t-test, as well as an independent samples t-test. The analysis of the results obtained showed that for both variables (physics achievement and metacognition) : (1) {{there was no significant difference}} between the pre-test and post-test scores for the group of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taught traditionally, (2) there was a significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores for the group of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taught by the use of KWL strategy and (3) there was a significant difference in the post-test scores between the group of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taught traditionally and the group of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taught by the use of the KWL strategy.

2500|$|People {{who wish}} to be baptized in the INC must first submit to a formal process taking at least six months. Once someone officially {{registers}} with their local congregation, the person is given the status of being a Bible student (Tagalog: dinudoktrinahan) and taught the twenty-five lessons concerning fundamental teachings and its beginnings in the Philippines. These lessons are contained in the doctrine manual written by Eraño G. Manalo entitled [...] "Fundamental Beliefs of the Iglesia ni Cristo". This book is given to ministers, evangelical workers, and ministerial students of the INC. Each lesson is usually thirty minutes to one hour in length. After hearing all the lessons, the students enters a probationary period (Tagalog: sinusubok) during which they are obliged to attend fifteen once-a-week group prayer meetings, where they are taught to pray and are guided in their adjustment to the INC lifestyle. When the sixth month comes, <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> active in attending the twice-a-week worship services and whose lifestyles are in accordance with INC doctrines are screened before being baptized. During the screening, they are asked questions about {{the teachings of the}} church.|$|E
2500|$|Students {{are usually}} {{notified}} of a college's decision in April, {{sometimes in the}} last two weeks of March, unless they had applied using an early approach, and are usually notified by email, although some colleges still send [...] "fat" [...] envelopes (usually an acceptance) or [...] "thin" [...] envelopes (usually a rejection). A trend appears to be declining percentages of acceptances to leading schools. There are indications that the percentage of students who say [...] "yes" [...] to an offer of admission (the yield) has been declining, from 49 percent in 2001 to 43 percent in 2009. Admitted students may also be awarded financial aid. There are two kinds of financial aid: need-based aid, awarded entirely on the financial specifics of the student's family, and merit-based aid, given to students judged to show exceptional academic promise. Several reports confirm that accepted students who are dissatisfied with an aid offer should contact the college to see if the offer can be improved. International <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> accepted should complete an I-20 form. A disappointing aid package may be appealed with a polite call to the school's financial aid office, while being thankful for any funds that have already been offered. In some cases, it is possible to bargain with a school for a more generous aid package, particularly if there is a more generous offer from a second school that the first school sees as a competitor. One report suggested that even by May 2012, 375 colleges still had space for first-year or transfer applicants for the fall of 2012. Twelfth graders accepted to college are expected to maintain good grades during the spring; for example, one hundred high school applicants accepted to Texas Christian University, whose grades plummeted in the spring of their twelfth grade as a symptom of senioritis, received so-called [...] "fear of God" [...] letters from an admissions dean asking them to explain themselves, and threatening to rescind offers of admission.|$|E
6000|$|Returned {{students}} (i.e. <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> at foreign universities) form {{a definite}} set in China.[98] There is in Peking a [...] "Returned Students' Club," [...] a charming place. It is customary among Europeans to speak ill of returned students, but {{for no good}} reason. There are occasionally disagreements between different sections; in particular, {{those who have been}} only to Japan are not regarded quite as equals by those who have been to Europe or America. My impression was that America puts a more definite stamp upon a student than any other country; certainly those returning from England are less Anglicized than those returning from the United States are Americanized. To the Chinaman who wishes to be modern and up-to-date, skyscrapers and hustle seem romantic, because they are so unlike his home. The old traditions which conservative Europeans value are such a mushroom growth compared to those of China (where authentic descendants of Confucius abound) that it is useless to attempt that way of impressing the Chinese. One is reminded of the conversation in Eothen between the English country gentleman and the Pasha, in which the Pasha praises England to the refrain: [...] "Buzz, buzz, all by steam; whir, whir, all on wheels," [...] while the Englishman keeps saying: [...] "Tell the Pasha that the British yeoman is still, thank God, the British yeoman." ...|$|E
