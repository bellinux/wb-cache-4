500|$|The AMX-30 is a main {{battle tank}} {{designed}} by Ateliers de construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX, then GIAT) and first {{delivered to the}} French Army in 1966. The first five tanks were issued to the 501st Régiment de Chars de Combat (Tank Regiment) in August of that year. The production version of the AMX-30 weighed , and sacrificed protection for increased mobility. The French believed {{that it would have}} required too much armour to protect against the latest anti-tank threats, thereby reducing the tank's maneuverability. Protection, instead, was provided by the speed and the compact dimensions of the vehicle, including a height of 2.28 metres. It had a 105mm gun, firing a then advanced high explosive anti-tank warhead known as the Obus G. The Obus G used an outer shell, separated from the main charge by ball bearings, to allow the round to be <b>spin</b> <b>stabilized</b> by the gun without affecting the warhead inside. Mobility was provided by the [...] HS-110 diesel engine, although the troublesome transmission adversely affected the tank's performance.|$|E
500|$|The Leopard 1 and the AMX-30 {{originated}} from a joint tank development program {{known as the}} Europanzer. [...] For a tank, the AMX-30 had a low silhouette; {{the height of the}} tank was 2.28meters (7.48ft), compared to the Leopard's 2.6meters (8.53ft). [...] In terms of lethality, the AMX-30's Obus G high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round {{was one of the most}} advanced projectiles at the time. [...] Because HEAT warheads become less efficient during spin stabilization induced by the rifling of a tank-gun barrel, the Obus G was designed so that the shaped charge warhead was mounted on ball bearings within an outer casing, allowing the round to be <b>spin</b> <b>stabilized</b> through the rifling of the gun without affecting the warhead inside. [...] The Obus G was designed to penetrate up to 400millimeters (15.75in) of steel armor. [...] On the other hand, the Leopard was armed with the L7A3 tank gun, capable of penetrating the frontal armor of most contemporary tanks. [...] Although the Leopard boasted greater armor than the AMX-30—partially accounting for the weight difference between the two tanks—the latter was sold at a cheaper price.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the unique}} {{features}} of the AMX-30 was the Obus à Charge Creuse de 105mm Modèle F1 (Obus G) HEAT projectile and its main gun, the Modèle F1, a monoblock steel [...] cannon. HEAT warheads suffer when <b>spin</b> <b>stabilized,</b> a product of rifled barrels, causing the French to develop the Obus G, (Gresse). This projectile was composed of two major parts, including the outer shell and a suspended inner shell, divided by ball bearings. This allowed the projectile to be spin-stabilized, and therefore more accurate than a normal fin-stabilized HEAT-round, while the inner shell did not move, allowing the warhead to work at maximum efficiency. The warhead, containing 780gram hexolite, could penetrate up to [...] of steel armour and was effective against tanks at up to [...] As it combined a good accuracy with a penetration that was independent of range, it has been considered an [...] "ideal round" [...] for its day The AMX-30 was also designed to fire the OCC F1 Mle.60 high explosive projectile, the SCC F1 training warhead and the OFUM PH-105 F1 smoke round. The main gun was coupled with a [...] recoil brake, which had a maximum extension of , and could depress to −8 degrees or elevate to 20 degrees. The turret's firepower was augmented by a coaxial [...] M2 Browning machine gun. The tank commander also made use of a [...] anti-aircraft machine gun on the turret roof. The vehicle carried 50 [...] projectiles, 748 [...] rounds and 2,050 [...] bullets. The tank commander was issued a cupola which offered ten all-around direct-vision episcopes, and a binocular telescope with 10x magnification. The commander was also given an optical full-field coincidence range finder. The gunner was given a telescoping gun sight and two observation periscopes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractChlorogenic acid (CGA; 3 -o-caffeoylquinic acid), a phenylpropanoid {{metabolite}} of plants, was oxidized by H 2 O 2 in {{the presence}} of horseradish peroxidase. The primary and secondary oxidized products both were free radicals which gave EPR multiline signals at g= 2. 0044 and 2. 0042 {{in the presence}} of zinc as a <b>spin</b> <b>stabilizing</b> agent. The EPR kinetics showed that ascorbate functioned as a cooperative reductant by regenerating CGA from its corresponding radicals. These results provide evidence to support the idea that the ascorbate-phenolic redox couple in conjunction with guaiacol peroxidase is an efficient H 2 O 2 scavenging mechanism in higher plants...|$|R
50|$|Giotto passed Halley {{successfully}} on 14 March 1986 at 596 km distance, {{and surprisingly}} survived despite {{being hit by}} some small particles. One impact sent it <b>spinning</b> off its <b>stabilized</b> <b>spin</b> axis so that its antenna no longer always pointed at the Earth, and importantly, its dust shield no longer protected its instruments.

40|$|Multi-wall carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) with diameters between 10 nm and 20 nm {{were prepared}} by melt <b>spinning,</b> <b>stabilizing</b> and carbonizing of fine core/shell- 1 /shell- 2 polymer microspheres. Microspheres were synthesized by three-steps soap free emulsion polymerization of methylmetacrylate (MMA) and acrylonitrile (AN) using potassium persulfate (KPS) as a polymerization radical initiator. The final composition of microspheres was PMMA core/PAN shell- 1 /PMMA shell- 2 and diameter ca. 500 nm. The outer PMMA layer {{played the role}} of a matrix polymer. Microspheres were directly melt spun at ca. 300 degreesC followed by stabilization of PAN at 220 degreesC in oxygen and carbonization at 1000 degreesC in nitrogen.

50|$|Four large tailfins induced enough <b>spin</b> to <b>stabilize</b> the rocket, {{but as it}} was unguided aiming was {{a matter}} of {{judgment}} and experience.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the idea of}} emergent lattices, where a simple lattice decouples into two weakly coupled lattices {{as a way to}} <b>stabilize</b> <b>spin</b> liquids. In LiZn[subscript 2]Mo[subscript 3]O[subscript 8], the disappearance of 2 / 3 of the spins at low temperatures suggests that its triangular lattice decouples into an emergent honeycomb lattice weakly coupled to the remaining spins, and we suggest several ways to test this proposal.

30|$|After electrospinning, the as <b>spun</b> nanofibers were <b>stabilized</b> and {{carbonized}} {{to obtain}} the carbon nanofibers. In this process, the as <b>spun</b> nanofibers were <b>stabilized</b> in oxygen atmosphere for a greater stability to sustain at higher temperature [17]. When increasing the temperature, the PAN crystal structure was almost completely destroyed and a thermally stable ladder polymeric structure was formed. The hollow structure in the HCNFs after thermal treatment was generated by thermal stability {{difference between the two}} precursor solutions. At high temperature, the PMMA core portion was totally decomposed to gaseous products without remaining residual material [13].

40|$|A key to {{achieving}} ultra-long electron spin memory in quantum dots (QDs) at 0 ~$T$ is the polarization of the nuclei, {{such that the}} electron <b>spin</b> is <b>stabilized</b> along the nuclear magnetic field.

50|$|For best performance, {{the barrel}} {{should have a}} twist rate {{sufficient}} to <b>spin</b> <b>stabilize</b> any bullet that it would reasonably be expected to fire, but not significantly more. Large diameter bullets provide more stability, as the larger radius provides more gyroscopic inertia, while long bullets are harder to stabilize, as {{they tend to be}} very backheavy and the aerodynamic pressures have a longer arm ("lever") to act on. The slowest twist rates are found in muzzleloading firearms meant to fire a round ball; these will have twist rates as low as 1 in 72 in, or slightly longer, although for a typical multi-purpose muzzleloader rifle, a twist rate of 1 in 48 in is very common. The M16A2 rifle, which is designed to fire the 5.56×45mm NATO SS109 ball and L110 tracer bullets, has a 1 in 7 in or 32 calibers twist. Civilian AR-15 rifles are commonly found with 1 in 12 in or 54.8 calibers for older rifles and 1 in 9 in or 41.1 calibers for most newer rifles, although some are made with 1 in 7 in or 32 calibers twist rates, the same as used for the M16 rifle. Rifles, which generally fire longer, smaller diameter bullets, will in general have higher twist rates than handguns, which fire shorter, larger diameter bullets.|$|R
50|$|Conversely, too-high {{a rate of}} twist {{can also}} cause problems. The {{excessive}} twist can cause accelerated barrel wear, and coupled with high velocities also induce a very high spin rate which can cause projectile jacket ruptures causing high velocity <b>spin</b> <b>stabilized</b> projectiles to disintegrate in flight. Projectiles made out of mono metals cannot practically achieve flight and spin velocities such that they disintegrate in flight due to their spin rate. Smokeless powder can produce muzzle velocities of approximately 1600 m/s for <b>spin</b> <b>stabilized</b> projectiles and more advanced propellants used in smoothbore tank guns can produce muzzle velocities of approximately 1800 m/s. A higher twist than needed can also cause more subtle problems with accuracy: Any inconsistency within the bullet, such as a void that causes an unequal distribution of mass, may be magnified by the spin. Undersized bullets also have problems, as they may not enter the rifling exactly concentric and coaxial to the bore, and excess twist will exacerbate the accuracy problems this causes.|$|E
