5|$|In December 1999 Warner Music Group, {{which owns}} Atlantic Records, stated they {{expected}} to <b>sell</b> <b>at</b> least five to six million copies of Shades of Purple. Sales had exceeded one million by September 2000, though investors were disappointed as they had not yet recuperated the amount they had spent promoting the duo; {{they expected to}} break even {{before the end of}} the year. The album sold 107,000 units in its opening week in the US, and had sold 268,000 units there by March 2002. Worldwide sales of the album exceeded 1.5 million by January 2002.|$|E

On March 3, 1893, Congress duly passed an act authorising the souvenir coin, which was to be to the specifications of the quarter struck for circulation, and with a design to be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. Total mintage of the special quarter would be limited to 40,000 specimens.|$|E

5|$|That same day, {{the four}} men present when the {{cylinder}} was opened (two of the scrap collectors and two scrapyard employees) began to feel ill, experiencing headaches, nausea and vomiting.

5|$|Ubisoft {{expected}} {{the game to}} <b>sell</b> <b>at</b> least six million copies {{in its first year}} of release.

5|$|From Bates, {{the picture}} passed to Walter Tyrell; {{another member of}} the Tyrell family, Edward, {{presented}} it to the National Gallery, London, in 1863, after it had failed to <b>sell</b> <b>at</b> an auction at Christie's in 1854. The painting was transferred to the Tate Gallery in 1929, although it was actually on loan to Derby Museum and Art Gallery between 1912 and 1947. It has been lent out for exhibitions to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1976, the National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm in 1979–1980, and Paris (Grand Palais), New York (Metropolitan) and the Tate in London in 1990. It was reclaimed by the National Gallery from the Tate in 1986. They describe its condition as good, with minor alterations visible on some figures. It was last cleaned in 1974.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{the club}} was located west of Michigan Avenue and behind the 620 {{building}} which was home to many of Chicago's finest art dealers including Richard Gray and Richard L. Feigen & Co. The Arts club did not own the land upon which their famous Mies clubhouse was built; instead, the club held the land in a longterm leasehold. In 1990, the owner of 620 N. Michigan and the Arts Club land decided to <b>sell.</b> <b>At</b> first the Arts Club hoped {{to raise the money}} to purchase its land along with the 620 N. Michigan Avenue property in an effort spearheaded by Richard Gray, but it quickly became apparent that the club would lose a bidding war over this valuable land. A developer bought the property and demolished the entire block {{to make way for a}} movie complex and shopping center.|$|E
5|$|On the microeconomic scale, {{companies}} have used telecommunications {{to help build}} global business empires. This is self-evident {{in the case of}} online retailer Amazon.com but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer Walmart has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors. In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In Bangladesh's Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In Côte d'Ivoire, coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and <b>sell</b> <b>at</b> the best price.|$|E

5|$|On {{the supply}} side, since 2005 the {{gasoline}} fuelling stations selling more than 3 million liters of fuel {{a year are}} required to <b>sell</b> <b>at</b> least one type of biofuel, resulting in more than 1,200 gas stations selling E85 by August 2008. Despite all the sharp growth of E85 flexifuel cars, by 2007 they represented just {{two percent of the}} four million Swedish vehicles. In addition, this law also mandated all new filling stations to offer alternative fuels, and stations with an annual volume of more than one million liters are required to have an alternative fuel pump by December 2009. Therefore, the number of E85 pumps is expected to reach by 2009 nearly 60% of Sweden's 4,000 filling stations.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. had {{acquired}} {{over a thousand}} vessels during World War I, and still owned most of them when Harding took office. Congress had authorized their disposal in 1920, but the Senate would not confirm Wilson's nominees to the Shipping Board. Harding appointed Albert Lasker as its chairman; the advertising executive undertook to run the fleet as profitably as possible until it could be sold. Most ships proved impossible to <b>sell</b> <b>at</b> anything approaching the government's cost. Lasker recommended a large subsidy to the merchant marine to enable the sales, and Harding repeatedly urged Congress to enact it. Unpopular in the Midwest, the bill passed the House but was defeated by a filibuster in the Senate, and most government ships were eventually scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Bullion prices {{continued}} to drop through the 1880s, increasing the loss by anyone forced to <b>sell</b> <b>at</b> melt value after accepting a trade dollar at face value. Despite {{the support of}} Secretary of the Treasury Charles J. Folger, {{the question of the}} redemption of the trade dollar became caught up in controversy over the heavy coinage of the new Morgan dollar under the inflationary Bland–Allison Act. Silver interests objected to the silver from redeemed trade dollars being counted towards the Mint's monthly quota under the act, preferring to sell newly mined silver instead, and opposed acts which so provided. It was not until 1887 that Congress, ostensibly to relieve the poor (though most trade dollars were by then in the hands of speculators), provided for the redemption of unmutilated trade dollars. The act, which did not count the redeemed silver towards the Bland–Allison Act quota, passed into law on February 14, 1887, when the ten-day period which President Grover Cleveland had to either sign or veto it expired with no action by the President. Many coins were not redeemable due to chop marks or holes applied by Chinese businessmen, which was done to affirm the coin's silver content. The dollars were only redeemable for six months, and the recovered silver was struck into dimes, quarters, and half dollars.|$|E

5|$|Hybrid Theory debuted {{at number}} 16 on the US Billboard 200, selling 50,000 copies {{in its first}} week. It was {{certified}} gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) five weeks after its release. In 2001, the album had sold 4.8 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the year, and {{it was estimated that}} the album continued selling 100,000 copies per week in early 2002. Throughout the following years, the album continued to <b>sell</b> <b>at</b> a fast pace and was eventually certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005 for shipment of ten million copies in the United States. To date, the album has sold 30 million copies worldwide, which makes it the best selling debut album of the 21st century. As of July 2017, the album has sold 10,500,000 copies in the US. After the death of Chester Bennington on July 20, 2017, the album reached number 1 on the iTunes and Amazon music charts.|$|E
5|$|In 1836 {{architect}} John Harper {{arranged a}} small exhibition in York {{of works by}} modern artists, which included 11 Etty paintings. This included the first public showing of Venus and her Doves, which had been commissioned by Daniel Grant. Although the exhibition broke even it met with little public interest, and no further Etty retrospectives were held for some years. Harper did {{take the opportunity to}} buy Etty's A Family of the Forest (also known as Flowers of the Forest), which had failed to <b>sell</b> <b>at</b> the 1836 Summer Exhibition. A Family of the Forest illustrates a passage from the Ancient Greek poem Theogony, dealing with the Golden Age before humanity suffered pain, misery or the need to work. The setting sun in the background and the man looking away from the woman and child, and instead into the distance, signify his knowledge that his days of ease are coming to an end.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{because of}} its size, The Sirens and Ulysses failed to <b>sell</b> <b>at</b> the Summer Exhibition. In October 1837 Etty met again with Daniel Grant who, without having seen the painting, offered £250 (about £ in today's terms) for Sirens and for Samson and Delilah, also {{exhibited}} by Etty that year. Etty, poor at business and always reluctant to keep unsold paintings in his studio, sold both paintings to Grant for well below their true worth. Etty had used a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which flaked when dry, {{and as soon as}} it was complete Sirens began to deteriorate. It was shown at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition but then considered in too poor a condition for further public display, and placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In 2006 restoration began on it, and in May 2010 Sirens was returned to public display and is now one of the key works in the Manchester Art Gallery.|$|E
