The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate the polishing of <b>secondary</b> <b>effluents</b> and Combine Sewer Overflows (CSOs) by a laboratory scale Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) considering local sub-surface geology and wastewater characteristics. Results show that characteristic soils of southwestern Ontario can effectively polish <b>secondary</b> <b>effluents</b> in terms of BOD 5 (64. 9 % to 100 %), e-coli (100 %) and total coliforms (100 %).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were {{the assessment of the}} effectiveness of coagulation on the reclamation of <b>secondary</b> <b>effluents</b> and the evaluation of the quality of reclaimed waters by the examination of their ecotoxic and mutagenic properties. Aluminum coagulants resulted in higher removal of organic content, than iron coagulant, reaching up to 40 %; the removal of heavy metals, such as zinc and copper was enhanced by the addition of a low strength anionic flocculant. The toxicity of pre-concentrated samples to the bacteria Vibrio fischerii was related to the heavy metal content, especially zinc and copper, indicating the significance of the metals bioavailability and their potential interactive effects. The <b>secondary</b> <b>effluents</b> exhibited mutagenic effects on strain TA 98; these effects were increased during coagulation with ferric chloride (both in absence and presence of flocculant). However, the addition of aluminum coagulants resulted in a decrease of mutagenic potential of <b>secondary</b> <b>effluents,</b> due to the extended removal of organic matter. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The HPLC-PR-CL analytical technique allowed for a systematic examination of {{the correlation between the}} fouling level and the permeation of N-nitrosamines in the <b>secondary</b> wastewater <b>effluent</b> and synthetic wastewaters through an RO membrane. Membrane fouling caused by the <b>secondary</b> wastewater <b>effluent</b> led to a notable decrease in the permeation of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) while a smaller but nevertheless discernible decrease in the permeation of N-nitrosomethylethylamine (NMEA), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) and N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) was also observed. Fluorescence spectrometry analysis revealed that major foulants in the <b>secondary</b> wastewater <b>effluent</b> were humic and fulvic acid-like substances.

A bench-scale hollow fibre membrane system was used to identify the type of fouling depending on the feed water quality. Results showed no measurable dissolved organic carbon removal by the membranes for the three <b>secondary</b> <b>effluents.</b> Biopolymers and humic-like substances found in different proportions in the three effluents were partially retained by the membranes and were identified to contribute significantly to the flux decline of the low pressure membranes.

Under a similar mass load, the investigated <b>secondary</b> <b>effluent</b> biopolymers lead to hydraulic resistance slightly higher than that caused by filtering surface water macromolecules; however, the correspondingly formed fouling is significantly less reversible by hydraulic backwashing. The quantity of the nitrogenous biopolymers in the <b>secondary</b> <b>effluent</b> demonstrated a strong correlation with the extent of the irreversible fouling in ultrafiltration (UF), while that from the surface water did not. In membrane fouling cleaning tests, certain detergent demonstrated high efficiency in removing the irreversible fouling after UF of the <b>secondary</b> <b>effluent,</b> but presented no effect in eliminating fouling caused by the surface water foulants.

A new hybrid system of photocatalytic oxidation and non-woven membrane separation was studied for treating <b>secondary</b> <b>effluent.</b> Initially, the foulant properties, such as polysaccharide, protein, and biopolymer, etc., were examined in a batch test.

The results revealed that the concentration of foulants in permeate increased with increasing applied flux, due to the reduction of hydraulic retention time (HRT). In comparison with the system using microfiltration (MF) or ultrafiltration (UF) membrane, larger specific flux was obtained in our non-woven membrane system.

40|$|Proteins {{constitute}} one of {{the largest}} fractions of organic material in <b>secondary</b> <b>effluent</b> from domestic wastewater treatment plants, and are a significant source of organic N released into receiving waters. Wastewater effluents from two wastewater treatment plants in Western Massachusetts were analyzed for protein content and activity. Effluents were concentrated using ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the component proteins subsequently separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and zymogramic electrophoresis. The results showed that some protein bands in primary effluent are also present in the <b>secondary</b> <b>effluent,</b> indicating the recalcitrance of some sewage proteins. These proteins are released into the Connecticut River. The presence of these same bands in <b>secondary</b> <b>effluent</b> that was filtered through a 0. 45 µm filter is an indication that a filtration step would not prevent the release of these particular proteins. Other bands that are visible in the <b>secondary</b> <b>effluent</b> are not found in the primary effluent, thus those proteins are produced in the activated sludge process. Zymogram electrophoresis of concentrated and raw effluents showed that some of the proteins in both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>effluent</b> are proteolytic enzymes. The parameters of total protein, inorganic nitrogen, organic nitrogen, COD, and TSS were also measured from primary and pre-chlorinated secondary effluents from each plant. It is thought that any proteins in <b>secondary</b> <b>effluent</b> are not biologically available given that they have survived the treatment processes in the plants; however, this has not been shown.

40|$|Loss of {{membrane}} filtration performance due to organic fouling {{is still a}} significant drawback {{for the application of}} low-pressure membranes in tertiary wastewater treatment. The present study investigates the relevance of different organic fractions present in <b>secondary</b> <b>effluents</b> in terms of hydraulically reversible and irreversible fouling of hollow-fibre ultrafiltration membranes. A good correlation between the hydraulically reversible filtration resistance and the total organic biopolymer concentration according to size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was observed. Qualitatively biopolymers consist mainly of polysaccharides as well as proteins with high molecular weight. Polysaccharides are retained by the membrane pores, but can be removed by simple UF backwashing. On the other hand, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) analysis indicates that the extent of the hydraulically irreversible fouling correlates with the presence of protein-like substances. Removal of protein-like substances by biological slow sand filtration or chemical coagulation results in the significant reduction of the hydraulically irreversible fouling, which is presumably due to proteins in the molecular range of biopolymers. In contrast to the comparatively low sensitivity of colorimetric methods for the analysis of proteins and polysaccharides, the combined application of size exclusion chromatography and fluorescence EEM analysis is a promising tool for the determination of the organic fouling propensity of <b>secondary</b> <b>effluents.</b> © 2011 Desalination Publications.
