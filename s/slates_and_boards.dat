6000|$|Although it has melancholy associations, I {{can hardly}} {{remember}} without a smile my last visit to good Bishop Payne. He {{led me to}} the mission-school, a shed that sheltered settles and desks, tattered books, <b>slates</b> <b>and</b> <b>boards,</b> two native pedagogues, and two lines of pupils sized from the right, the biggest being nearest the 'boss.' We took our places upon the bench, and the catechiser, when bade to begin, opened, after a little hesitation, as follows:-- ...|$|E

Not contented with tearing off all the wainscot and hangings, and splitting the doors to pieces, they beat down the partition walls; and although that alone cost them near two hours, they cut down the cupola or lanthorn, and they began to take the <b>slate</b> <b>and</b> <b>boards</b> from the roof, and were prevented only by the approaching daylight from a total demolition of the building. The garden-house was laid flat, and all my trees, etc., broke down to the ground.|$|R

50|$|Originally instigated by Mr. McCubbin the rector of Kilsyth Academy, who {{had drawn}} ‘Wullie Gairden’s {{attention}} to {{the limitations of the}} old slate blackboard with its necessity for constant cleaning. Small teachers had to stand on boxes to reach the top of the <b>slate</b> <b>board</b> <b>and</b> tall teachers had to stoop to reach the bottom of the board. “Couldn’t you do something about that?” he asked, and the challenge was enough for him.|$|R
40|$|The one-room school {{experience}} {{is a part of}} U. S. and Tennessee history that should be preserved and shared. Since the last generation of scholars who attended one-room schools will soon be gone, the Jonesborough-Washington County (Tennessee) History Museum recreated this early system of education through a "living classroom " heritage program in an. original rural one-room schoolhouse: Oak Hill School. On a field trip to Oak Hill School, students participate in a school day in 1892. Lessons from era textbooks are taught {{in a manner consistent with}} one-room schooling. Students use <b>slate</b> pencils <b>and</b> <b>slate</b> <b>boards,</b> practice arithmetic drills and spelling lists, make copybooks to practice penmanship with a quill pen and ink, wear school clothing of the period, bring lunch in lard pails, and play 19 th-century games during recess. Although this guide was produced to prepare students for class visits, background information is included to enable any teacher to turn his or her classroom into a late 19 th-century one-room school. The experience is designed to enhance the fourth-grade Tennessee social studies and language arts curriculum but is adaptable to other grad...|$|R
50|$|The {{sound is}} synched {{to the film}} using a clapperboard as a reference. The clapperboard is labeled to {{identify}} the scene, shot, and take number for the camera. The numbers are also read aloud to label the audio recording. Once camera and sound are rolling, a camera assistant will close the clapper creating a visual and auditory reference point. During the synching process after the film has been developed, the technician {{will look at the}} numbers on the <b>slate</b> <b>board</b> <b>and</b> then match the numbers with the verbal slate. Then the technician looks for the frame where the clapper first closes and for the beep or clapping sound on the audio tape, adjusting one or the other until they happen simultaneously when played back. This needs to be done for every take. Systems exist which record synchronized timecode onto the film and audio tape at the time of shooting, allowing for automatic alignment of picture and audio. In practice these systems are rarely used.|$|R
