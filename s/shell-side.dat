At the same flow area, the double shell-pass STHXCH is compared with a single shell-pass STHXCH and a conventional shell-and-tube {{heat exchanger}} with segmental baffles (STHXSG) by means of numerical method. The numerical {{results show that the}} <b>shell-side</b> heat transfer coefficients of the novel heat exchanger are 12 – 17 % and 14 – 25 % higher than those of STHXSG and single shell-pass STHXCH, respectively; the <b>shell-side</b> pressure drop of the novel heat exchanger is slightly lower than that of STHXSG and 29 – 35 % higher than that of single shell-pass STHXCH.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this present study is to propose an approach to predict mass transfer time relaxation parameter for boiling simulation on the <b>shell-side</b> of LNG spiral wound heat exchanger (SWHE). The numerical model for the <b>shell-side</b> of LNG SWHE was established. For propane and ethane, a predicted value of mass transfer time relaxation parameter was presented through the equivalent evaporation simulations and was validated by the Chisholm void fraction correlation recommended under various testing conditions. In addition, heat transfer deviations between simulations using the predicted value of mass transfer time relaxation parameter and experiments from Aunan were investigated.

40|$|<b>Shell-side</b> vapour {{velocities}} through {{heat exchangers}} {{should be kept}} low to prevent erosion when moisture or suspended particles present. In this work, simple-to-use equations, which are easier than currently available models and involve a fewer number of fitted parameters, requiring less complicated and shorter computations, are formulated to arrive at an appropriate prediction of maximum <b>shell-side</b> vapour velocities through heat exchangers for wide range of conditions {{as a function of}} molecular weight and pressure. The proposed fitted equations accurately estimate the maximum <b>shell-side</b> vapour velocities through heat exchangers for pressures up to 7500 kPa(abs), and molecular weights up to 400. The values calculated here are maximum for reasonable operation. In order to reduce pressure drop, velocities must be well below the maximum values. Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with the reported data in the literature with average absolute deviation being around 3. 9 %. The fitted equations developed in this study can be of immense practical value for the engineers and scientists to have a quick check on the maximum <b>shell-side</b> vapour velocities through heat exchangers at wide range of conditions without opting for any experimental measurements. In particular, chemical and process engineers would find the simple equations to be user-friendly with transparent calculations involving no complex expressions...|$|E
40|$|A diffusion-controlled {{electrochemical}} {{mass transfer}} technique has been employed in making local measurements of <b>shell-side</b> coefficients in segmentally baffled {{shell and tube}} heat exchangers. Corresponding heat transfer data are predicted through the Chilton and Colburn heat and mass transfer analogy. Mass transfer coefficients were measured for baffle spacing lengths of individual tubes in an internal baffle compartment. <b>Shell-side</b> pressure measurements were also made. Baffle compartment average coefficients derived from individual tube coefficients are shown {{to be in good}} agreement with reported experimental bundle average heat transfer data for a heat exchanger model of similar geometry. Mass transfer coefficients of individual tubes compare favourably with those obtained previously by another mass transfer technique. Experimental data are reported for a variety of segmental baffle configurations over the <b>shell-side</b> Reynolds number range 100 to 42 000. Baffles with zero clearances were studied at three baffle cuts and two baffle spacings. Baffle geometry is shown to have a large effect on the distribution of tube coefficients within the baffle compartment. Fluid "jetting" is identified with some baffle configurations. No simple characteristic velocity is found to correlate zonal or baffle compartment average mass transfer data for the effect of both baffle cut and baffle spacing. Experiments with baffle clearances typical of commercial heat exchangers are also reported. The effect of leakage streams associated with these baffles is identified. Investigations were extended to double segmental baffles for which no data had previously been published. The similarity in the <b>shell-side</b> characteristics of this baffle arrangement and two parallel single segmental baffle arrangements is demonstrated. A general relationship between the <b>shell-side</b> mass transfer performance and pressure drop was indicated by the data for all the baffle configurations examined...|$|E
30|$|Meanwhile, {{three kinds}} of grid number in <b>shell-side</b> were {{established}} to conduct the grid independence test, 316723, 323123 and 329523.

Almost equal vibration frequency of planar elastic tube bundle occurs for these {{three kinds of}} grid number. Therefore, the <b>shell-side</b> was discretized to 323123 grids to solve the flow-induced vibration calculation in view of saving computer resource and keeping a balance between computational economics and accuracy.|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} heat {{transfer}} enhancement techniques are reviewed and evaluated {{for use in}} marine condensers. This review includes tube-side enhancement, as well as <b>shell-side</b> enhancement techniques. At present, the most promising technique to enhance heat transfer on the tube side is {{with one of the}} commercially available, mildly indented, corrugated tubes. With this type of tube, the <b>shell-side</b> heat transfer enhancement is not as large and is uncertain due to the, as yet determined, complex effects of vapor shear and condensate inundation.

40|$|Traditionally, {{hollow fiber}} {{membrane}} contactors used for gas–liquid contacting were designed in a {{shell and tube}} configuration with <b>shell-side</b> fluid flowing parallel to the fiber-side fluid, either in co-current or counter-current pattern. The primary limitations of these so-called ‘parallel flow’ contactors are the <b>shell-side</b> flow channeling or mal-distribution due to non-uniform packing of the hollow fibers, higher <b>shell-side</b> pressure drop and relatively lower mass transfer coefficients. These limitations can be eliminated or reduced substantially by placing hollow fibers perpendicular to the flow direction. In these cross-flow membrane contactors the concentrations of both fluids vary in both directions i. e. {{in the direction of}} the flow as well as in the direction perpendicular to the flow. Hence, unlike parallel flow contactors, simple logarithmic averaging of the concentration driving force cannot be used to predict performance of the cross-flow membrane contactors. Similar changes in the driving force are also found in the cross-flow shell and tube heat exchanger. An analytical expression based on heat transfer analogy is derived in this work to describe the mass transfer in these hollow fiber cross-flow contactors. However, it was found that when the change in the volumetric flow of the compressible fluid is significant heat transfer analogy cannot be used to predict the performance of the cross-flow gas–liquid membrane contactor. Therefore, a detailed numerical model is developed to analyze the performance of the cross-flow membrane contactor in such cases. The model takes into account the <b>shell-side</b> mixing, change in concentration driving force in all direction as well as cascading two or more cross-flow modules to give overall co- or counter-current flow arrangement. To validate the model and developed analytical expression, carbon dioxide absorption experiments were carried out in cross-flow membrane contactor using water as a solvent. The predictions of the developed numerical model were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{considerable}} volume of work available in literature {{which suggests that the}} performance of axial-flow hollow fibre membrane modules is limited by poorly distributed flow through the <b>shell-side.</b> This study was commissioned to examine the distribution of <b>shell-side</b> flow and its effect on mass transfer and to compare the performance measured by the axial-flow configuration to that obtained by a commonly used alternative known as the helically-wound module design. Laminar flow and mass transfer models have been developed to examine performance through axial-flow hollow fibre modules. These models also consider deviations from laminar flow in the form of turbulence and hydrodynamically undeveloped flow. Modelling analysis on four fibre bundle cross-sections quantify the extent to which channelling limits flow and mass transfer performance. Experimental flow and mass transfer work with locally fabricated hollow fibre modules demonstrated some inconsistencies with axial laminar flow modelling. Pressure drop and mass transfer results exceeded predictions from modelling. This thesis has hypothesised that fibres in axial-flow hollow fibre modules are not aligned as straight and parallel rods (as assumed in modelling) but interweave. Fibre interweaving results in flows between ducts. Such flows create mixing between ducts which results in more intimate contact between the flow and membrane surface, the consequence being higher pressure drop and higher mass transfer. The implication from this work was that axial flow and mass transfer modelling was limited in its use for characterisation of <b>shell-side</b> performance. The experience with helically-wound hollow fibre membrane modules (also fabricated locally) was that, by deliberately inducing flow between ducts, it was possible to considerably improve mass transfer performance. It was found that, whilst helically-wound modules could not be packed as tightly as axial-flow modules and required more sophisticated fabrication techniques, the benefit in their use arose from a substantial improvement in the level of <b>shell-side</b> mass transfer...|$|E

Generally the effects of the higher operating temperatures on the various damping mechanisms are neglected in the general design procedure.

40|$|Typical {{industrial}} shell-and-tube {{heat exchanger}} configurations are investigated systematically for {{the occurrence of}} potentially damaging tube vibration {{as a function of}} flow-rate. In continuation of an ongoing experimental program, results from <b>shell-side</b> water flow tests of twenty-two additional test exchanger configurations are reported. The test cases include single- and double-segmentally baffled tube bundles having various combinations of triangular and square tube layout patterns, baffle arrangements, and baffle edge orientations. All layouts had a tube pitch-to-diameter ratio of 1. 25. The testing focused on identification of the lowest critical flow-rates to initiate fluid-elastic instability and/or large amplitude tube motion and the location within the bundle of the tubes which first experience these responses. The threshold flow-rates are determined from a combination of methods based on sensory observations, vibration amplitude data, and frequency response information.

40|$|A gas–liquid {{hollow fibre}} {{membrane}} contactor (HFMC) {{process has been}} introduced for carbon dioxide (CO 2) separation from biogas where aqueous ammonia (NH 3) is used to chemically enhance CO 2 absorption and initiate heterogeneous nucleation of the reaction product ammonium bicarbonate at the membrane–solvent interface. Aqueous ammonia absorbents (2 – 7 M) were initially used in single pass for CO 2 separation from a synthetic biogas where nucleation of ammonium bicarbonate crystals was observed at {{the perimeter of the}} micropores. Recirculation of the aqueous ammonia absorbent encouraged the growth of ammonium bicarbonate crystals on the <b>shell-side</b> of the membrane that measured several microns in diameter. However, at high aqueous NH 3 concentrations (3 – 7 M), lumen side crystallisation occurred and obstructed gas flow through the lumen of the HFMC. The suggested mechanism for lumen-side crystallisation was absorbent breakthrough into the lumen due to pore wetting which was promoted by low absorbent surface tension at high NH 3 concentration. Preferential <b>shell-side</b> nucleation can therefore be promoted by (1) raising surface tension of the absorbent and (2) selection of a membrane with a more regulated pore shape than the PTFE membrane used (d/L 0. 065) as both actions can diminish solvent ingress into the pore. This was evidenced using 2 M NH 3 absorbent where <b>shell-side</b> crystallisation was evidenced without the onset of lumen side crystallisation. Raising surface tension through the inclusion of salt into the chemical absorbent also promoted greater CO 2 flux stability. Importantly, this study demonstrates that chemically enhanced HFMC are an attractive prospect for gas–liquid separation applications where reaction product recovery offers further economic value...|$|E
40|$|AbstractShell-and-tube heat {{exchangers}} with trefoil-hole baffles are new type heat transfer devices and {{widely used in}} nuclear power system due to their special advantages, with the fluid flowing longitudinally on the shell side.

40|$|Pervaporation with {{hydrophobic}} membranes {{has been}} widely recognised as a possible process to recover organic compounds from wasterwater. Compared to vacuum pervaporation, on which many researchers have focused, sweep gas pervaporation has received little attention. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse opportunities for integrating and optimising both process layouts for the treatment of wastewater. The focus was on hollow fibre modules. Two module configurations of hollow fibre modules were considered: (1) <b>shell-side</b> and (2) tube-side feed flow. An advanced simulation program based on a phenomenological/semi-empirical model was used. The influence of (1) process parameters such as permeate pressure and the size of the sweep stream per module, and of (2) module design parameters such as void fraction or module configuration was determined for two model substances pyridine and phenol. Based on the simulations, guidelines for the optimisation of pervaporation are presented. These include the observation that for vacuum pervaporation <b>shell-side</b> feed flow is superior, whilst for sweep gas pervaporation tube-side feed flow should be selected. In the former case and for a given feed rate per module, the void fraction within the module should be selected as low as possible to reduce the effect of concentration polarisation. This approach is, however, limited by the pressure resistance of packed fibres causing an increasing pressure gradient on the feed side. For hydrophobic pervaporation of wastewater, sweep gas pervaporation should be combined with a moderate vacuum (of around 0. 1 bar) to improve the pervaporation performance; the performance at atmospheric pressure for the conditions selected leads to excessive membrane areas. Similar to vacuum pervaporation the void fraction should be selected as high as possible for tube-side feed flow, and as low as possible for <b>shell-side</b> feed flow...|$|E

40|$|Steam {{condensation}} {{plays an}} essential role in supplying and removing heat in many industrial applications, including the energy sector. It therefore is a phenomena of significance that requires deep understanding. This thesis presents effective vacuum steam condensation on the <b>shell-side</b> of vertical shell and tube condenser (VSTC) accompanying steam desuperheating. It describes a fundamental study of heat transfer in VSTC with considerations of several factors; explicitly degree of superheat related with each vacuum steam pressure, temperature waviness in desuperheating section, and steam condensation in absence of non-condensable gas (NCG). Experiments performed on the VSTC are: Steam desuperheating and condensation in the <b>shell-side</b> VSTC at a variety of vacuum steam pressures and respective steam flowrates, vacuum steam desuperheating and condensation in the <b>shell-side</b> of VSTC at reduced steam flowrates, and vacuum steam desuperheating and condensation at tube wall temperatures up to steam saturation temperature (T₂ ≥ Tsat) to analyse dry heat transfer in the desuperheating section. To examine the stated aim, test facility was built in the laboratory of the University of Waikato. By generating desuperheating and condensation models for each test pressure, this investigation proves that vacuum steam condensation best occurs without involvement of superheat. About 60 % of the VSTC occupied with desuperheating, and the heat transfer involved in desuperheating is minor approximately 1 kW, whereas, the condensation section of VSTC has heat transfer about 10 kW. By reducing the steam flowrate, 10 % reduction in the desuperheating section and 20 % to 50 % reduction in the Reynolds number was observed. After raising the tube wall temperature up to the steam saturation temperature, a smooth temperature profile across the desuperheating the section was seen with significant sensible heat transfer.

From the viewpoint of engineering, an optimum design is obtained via maximum heat {{transfer rate}} and minimum cost. Here, an analysis of a radial, finned, shell and tube heat exchanger is carried out, considering nine design parameters: tube arrangement, tube diameter, tube pitch, tube length, number of tubes, fin height, fin thickness, baffle spacing ratio and number of fins per unit length of tube. The “Delaware modified” technique is used to determine heat transfer coefficients and the <b>shell-side</b> pressure drop. In this technique, the baffle cut is 20 percent and the baffle ratio limits range from 0. 2 to 0. 4.

Mass transfer processes in the fiber sorbent module are analyzed for hydrogen recovery and compared with results for an equivalent size packed bed with identical diameter and length. The model indicates advantageous cases for application of fiber sorbent module over packed bed technology that allows system downsizing and energy saving by changing the outer and bore diameters to maintain or even reduce the pressure drop. The CA-NaY fiber sorbent was spun successfully with highly porous structure and high CO 2 sorption capacity. The fiber sorbent enables the <b>shell-side</b> void space for thermal moderation to heat of adsorption, while this {{cannot be applied to}} the packed bed. The poly(vinyl alcohol) coated CA-NaY demonstrated the thermal moderation with paraffin wax, which was carefully selected and melt at slightly above operating temperature, in the <b>shell-side</b> in a rapidly cycled pressure swing adsorption. So this new approach is attractive for some hydrogen recovery applications as an alternative to traditional zeolite pellets.

40|$|AbstractA new shell-and-tube heat {{exchanger}} with the H-shape baffle support structure in <b>shell-side</b> is presented. Analysis of fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics {{were carried out}} with the segmental baffle, rod baffle and H-shape baffle support structures in shell-sides of shell-and-tube {{heat exchanger}}s, by adopting periodic numerical models. The characteristics in the three heat exchangers were compared and discussed. It is shown that the heat exchanger with the H-shape baffle support structure combines the respective characteristics of heat exchangers with cross fluid flow and longitudinal fluid flow in shell-sides, and integrates advantages of both heat exchangers. On some operating conditions, the new heat exchanger with the H-shape baffle support structure has wide application prospect...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} numerical simulations {{and experimental}} measurements of isothermal and non-isothermal flow of non-Newtonian fluids {{in the shell}} side of a multi-tube tubular heat exchanger. Some results for the turbulent isothermal flow of water are also presented. A single pass of a commercially available Tetra Spiraflo 7 x 16 MT multi-tube heat exchanger has been instrumented to provide pressure drop and temperature data. Numerical predictions obtained with commercial software are generally in good agreement with measure-ments. The simulations are then used to determine more detailed features of the <b>shell-side</b> flow {{in this type of}} multi-tube heat exchanger. The work forms part of a project investigating the use of multi-tube heat exchangers in heat recovery mode for medium viscosity food products...|$|E
40|$|As an {{extended}} exploration of process enhancing strategies, nine modified hollow fiber modules with various turbulence promoters were designed and modeled using a two dimensional {{computational fluid dynamic}} (CFD) heat-transfer model to investigate their potential in improving heat transfer and module performance for a <b>shell-side</b> feed direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) system. With the aids of turbulence promoters, the feed heat-transfer coefficient hf of the modified modules generally showed much slower decreasing trends along the fiber length compared to the original (unmodified) module. A 6 -fold hf enhancement could be achieved by a modified module with annular baffles and floating round spacers. Consistently, the temperature polarization coefficient (TPC) and mass flux distribution curves of these modified modules presented increasing trends and gained an optimal improvement of 57...|$|E
