5|$|A further fire {{broke out}} during the early morning of 14 December. Firefighters were of the view that {{extinguishing}} it would leave the risk of petroleum vapour re-igniting or exploding, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better to allow the fire, which was well contained, to burn itself out. Hertfordshire Fire Service's deputy chief Mark Yates stated that escaping petroleum vapour was the most likely cause of the original explosion and fire.|$|E
5|$|Game {{designer}} Roberta Williams, {{co-founder of}} Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, {{the game is}} focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward.|$|E
5|$|Minor {{changes were}} made to the track on 22 February 2010 after {{bobsleigh}} four-man teams from Latvia and Croatia rolled over in supplementary practice. Following a meeting with 11 team captains, practice runs were postponed by the FIBT until later that day to adjust the shape of turn 11 <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> easier for sleds to get {{through the rest of the}} track without crashing. FIBT spokesman Don Krone also stated that it was common that turn profiles were changed when it was being used by other sliding disciplines such as luge and skeleton.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Chris Menaul and written by series creator Paul Attanasio. Wilford Brimley made a guest appearance as Harry Prentice, an ill and bed-ridden man who convinces his son to help him kill himself. Attanasio deliberately wrote the script <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> morally questionable whether police handling of both the suicide and the police shooting were done in an ethically correct way. Pembleton's investigation {{was based on a}} real-life investigation into a suspicious shooting featured in David Simon's non-fiction book , on which the Homicide series was based.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipping}} line operations of Cunard didn't escape review by Smallpeice. He was already {{familiar with the}} containerisation of freight prior to taking up his position with Cunard, but spent time during 1966 to visit the Sea-Land Service container terminal at Port Newark and further familiarised himself {{with the use of}} containers in marine traffic. Container ships were considered too large for the traditional British {{shipping line}}s, including Cunard and their subsidiaries to operate, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> necessary to form partnerships.|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean Greeks {{were also}} pioneers {{in the field}} of engineering, {{launching}} large-scale projects unmatched in Europe until the Roman period, such as fortifications, bridges, culverts, aqueducts, dams and roads suitable for wheeled traffic. They also made several architectural innovations, such as the relieving triangle. They were also responsible for transmitting a wide range of arts and crafts, especially of Minoan origin. The Mycenaean civilization was in general more advanced compared to the Late Bronze Age cultures of the rest of Europe. Several Mycenaean attributes and achievements were borrowed or held in high regard in later periods; <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no exaggeration to consider Mycenaean Greece as a cradle of civilization.|$|E

5|$|Carmella's {{relationship}} with Connor was originally scripted for Nina Tucker, but {{was transferred to}} Carmella by the producers on Goodrem's departure. Upon Carmella's introduction, her only family member was her mobster father Rocco, who {{had been sent to}} prison. In 2006, Carmella was given a sister, when Natalie Saleeba was cast in the role of Rosetta Cammeniti. Blair opined that Rosie's inclusion brought out different sides to Carmella's character. Many viewers told Blair they felt the casting was good because they look alike. One of the significant changes to Carmella was that she started having fun again—Blair felt this meant they worked well together. Later, Erin McNaught was cast as her cousin Sienna Cammeniti. McNaught commented {{that there had been a}} rivalry between the cousins in their youth, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> interesting to see what unfolded between them.|$|E
5|$|General Motors' then-Vice-Chairman Robert Lutz {{said the}} {{two-seater}} sports car {{being developed by}} Tesla, the Tesla Roadster, and the rapid advancement of lithium-ion battery technology inspired him to push the carmaker to develop the Volt after the 2006 Detroit Auto Show, overcoming internal opposition. Lutz's initial idea was to develop an all-electric car, but Jon Lauckner, General Motors Vice President for Global Vehicle Development, convinced him that to avoid an expensive battery, range anxiety concerns, and lack of public charging infrastructure, they could use a smaller battery pack with a small gasoline engine driving a generator acting as a backup to extend the range, but without a mechanical connection between the gasoline engine and the drive wheels, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a pure electrically driven vehicle without many of the limitations General Motors learned from the EV1 experience.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} {{originally}} {{wanted to create}} the game's boss battles in-house around the game's similar elements of player choice, with their initial design inspired by the boss fights in Metal Gear Solid. As the development on the story and gameplay framework took priority, boss battles became less and less of a focus. It eventually reached a point when the main development team could not complete them {{in time for the}} game's release. The team contemplated cutting them, but that would have negatively impacted the story and other areas of the game's design. In the end, development of the boss battles was outsourced to Grip Entertainment. Having been given access to the game's engine, Grip Entertainment were given the task of creating the boss battles and incorporating them into the framework of Human Revolution. For this, they needed to incorporate their own technology into the system, working from Eidos' specifications while bringing their own development style to bear on the project. They also attempted to balance the boss fights' action-focused approach with the other elements within Human Revolution <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> accessible to all players.|$|E

5|$|The tooth resembles multituberculates—a {{large group}} of extinct mammals with many-cusped teeth—in {{the shapes of the}} valleys and crests, but multituberculates lack fossae and usually have quadrangular teeth with two {{longitudinal}} rows of cusps separated by a central valley. In the same features, LACM 149371 resembles gondwanatheres, a small and enigmatic group of mammals from the Cretaceous through Eocene of the southern (Gondwanan) continents that may be related to multituberculates. In particular, Ferugliotherium from the late Cretaceous of Argentina has similarly formed cusps and also has crests that connect the cusps {{to the center of the}} tooth. However, the upper molars are unknown, and the low-crowned teeth of Ferugliotherium lack deep fossae. Members of the higher-crowned gondwanathere family Sudamericidae do have fossae. Goin and colleagues conclude that LACM 149371 most likely represents a member of the gondwanathere family Ferugliotheriidae; if <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> among the youngest known gondwanatheres.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of Bucher and his aircraft, the C-130 Hercules had not {{completed}} a successful evacuation, and {{there were more than}} 600 people still on the ground. Next in line was Lieutenant Colonel William Boyd; he was flying an airlift mission into Chu Lai, until he was diverted into Khâm Đức to extract forces and civilians there. Just before Boyd touched down, an artillery shell exploded about 100 feet in front of his aircraft, so he was forced to pull the throttle forward. Boyd then pulled up and went around for a second approach, because he could see the desperation {{of the people on the}} ground. As he landed, hundreds of civilians and soldiers poured out of the ditches and rushed onto the aircraft. Because he had witnessed the destruction of Bucher's C-130 while taking off in the north direction, Boyd decided to fly out from the southwest. After Boyd's aircraft was airborne, he banked the aircraft <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> masked by the rolling terrain. The aircraft sustained damages to the left wing, the fuselage, and the leading edge of both wings, but it landed safely in Chu Lai with all the passengers.|$|E
5|$|Moe and Renee seem to form {{a strong}} relationship, but Moe is {{insecure}} about his hold on her and he feels he must spend {{large amounts of money}} so she will stay with him. Upon maxing out his credit card, Moe comes up with a scheme to commit insurance fraud by having Homer steal his car and park it on train tracks <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> destroyed. The night the scheme is supposed to take place, Moe and Renee attend a police charity event aboard a yacht; the event's attendance by all the officers in town ensures Homer will not get caught perpetrating the scheme, and gives Moe an alibi so that no one will suspect he was behind the act. Homer botches the plan by stopping to watch a drive-in movie, while the train they were counting on to destroy Moe's car passes by. Deciding all is not lost, Homer drives the car over a cliff — but his attempt to exit the car before it sinks into the water below fails. The car ends up sinking just near the yacht where the police charity event is taking place, and when Homer swims to the surface, he is arrested.|$|E
