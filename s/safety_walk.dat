40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to suggest a multi-method {{approach}} for assessing safety in parks. The study is based on the analysis of police crime data combined with information from a <b>safety</b> <b>walk</b> and safety survey of park users. The framework is tested in an urban park, Vingis, in the inner city of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Findings show that Vingis is perceived as a safe park, but, compared with police statistics, the survey and the <b>safety</b> <b>walk</b> provide a more nuanced diagnostic of safety in this green area. Vingis’ safety is compromised by car traffic and illicit parking practices, the park’s poor capacity to accommodate users’ needs (e. g. the elderly, parents with small children, young people) and the inadequate infrastructure for users at certain times, such as in the evenings and dark months of the year. Patterns of safety expressed by citizens of Vingis park do not differ from the ones found in parks elsewhere (both in relation to their physical and social environment), despite the recent transformations Vilnius, as the capital city, has overcome since the country’s independence. The article concludes with an assessment of the proposed framework and directions for research and intervention...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The primary {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to provide a venue for discussing safety concerns and to facilitate finding solutions for everyday safety issues. Methods: The multidisciplinary patient safety committee (Team Safety) at Kosair Children’s Hospital began safety rounds in January 2007. Each month, several teams walked through patient care areas and talked to staff. Responses to questions and other comments mentioned during rounds were recorded. Between safety rounds, the Team Safety chairperson met with the Vice President of Clinical Operations to discuss the findings, assign priorities, and develop action plans. Results: From January 2007 through August 2007, Team Safety members talked with 182 staff from at least 10 disciplines and recorded 79 different concerns; 39 percent of these have been completely or partially resolved. More staff know how to report events and near misses and can describe how the information is used. Conclusion: Frontline caregivers can conduct effective <b>safety</b> <b>walk</b> rounds...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Patient safety {{leadership}} walk rounds {{were initiated}} at the Aga Khan University Hospital {{in the beginning}} of the year 2012. AKUH is a tertiary care teaching hospital at Karachi, Pakistan that aims at developing a patient safety culture that fosters change and improves clinical practice. These walk rounds serves as a tool to connect senior leaders to frontline staff as a mean to educate senior leaders of the safety issues as well as signaling frontline staff to senior leader’s commitment to safety. Aims: The aims of these <b>safety</b> <b>walk</b> rounds were to demonstrate commitment to safety, to provide opportunities for senior executives to learn about patient safety at ground level and to identify opportunities for improvement. Methodology: Core group was formed including executive leaders, clinical chairs and nursing managers. The group conducted quarterly visits to different areas including emergency department, medical and surgical units, Labor 2 ̆ 6 Delivery unit, radiology and clinical laboratory. By far a total of 20, hourly round has been conducted in these areas. The group asked questions to available frontline staff (8 to 10 on average) about adverse events and near misses and about the factors that causes such an event in the department. Events captured in the walk rounds were classified into departmental, interdepartmental and system wide or budgetary issues. Departmental heads and managers were then followed regularly by the lead patient safety nurse to update the team on the work done to overcome the identified issues. Results: Total 153 issues i. e., 104 (67. 97...|$|E
40|$|Work {{safety and}} health is a health aspect which related close with work {{environment}} whether directly or not to give work-force effectiveness and productivity. Beside giving protection to the work-force, work {{safety and health}} also protected the organization’s assets. To control loss caused by work-accident which could be existed, the application of work safety and health should be held continuously. One need to avoid accident {{is not limited to}} the people who prepare themselves in order to avoid accident, people who have dangerous behavior also never want any accident happened to him/her. Work accident is a huge problem for an organization. Dominant factor which caused work accident is human aspect. That’s why accident avoidance should put human aspect as central aspect through safety behavior approach. PT. PERTAMINA (Persero) Processing Unit V Balikpapan in visual way has assessed that safety behavior culture decreasing. According to the fact, the management made program, it was Safety Improvement Implementation Program consisted of SWAT (<b>Safety</b> <b>Walk</b> and Talk), PTW (Permit To Work) and PPE (Personal Protective Equipment). The research was qualitative descriptive research. The research location was in crude oil and gas company, it was PT. PERTAMINA (Persero) Processing Unit V Balikpapan. The subjects used were workers who followed Safety Improvement Implementation Program. In the research, the writer collected data through interview, observation and documentation. In data analysis, there used qualitative descriptive method aimed to give description about research result. According to the data analysis, there could be concluded that the effect caused by the Safety Improvement Implementation Program are the more knowledge of the worker of the program by obeying and running the existing rule by the company, especially in using protection tool while working. The preparation which was done by the worker is by making commitment to do safe behavior in work by using protection tools...|$|E

40|$|Sight dominates our mental life, {{more than}} any other sense. Even when we are just {{thinking}} about something the world, we end imagining what looks like. This rich visual experience is part of our lives. People need the vision for two complementary reasons. One of them is vision give us the knowledge to recognize objects in real time. The other reason is vision provides us the control one need to move around and interact with objects. Eyesight helps people to avoid dangers and navigate in our world. Blind people usually have enhanced accuracy and sensibility of their other natural senses to sense their surroundings. But sometimes this is not enough because the human senses can be affected by external sources of noise or disease. Without any foreign aid or device, sightless cannot navigate in the world. Many assistive tools have been developed to help blind people. White canes or guide dogs help blind in their navigation. Each device has their limitation. White canes cannot detect head level obstacles, drop-offs, and obstructions over a meter away. The training of a guide dog takes a long time, almost five years in some cases. The sightless also needs training and is not a solution for everybody. Taking care of a guide dog can be expensive and time consuming. Humans have developed technology for helping us in every aspect of our lives. The primary goal of technology is helping people to improve their quality of life. Technology can assist us with our limitations. Wireless sensor networks is a technology that has been used to help people with disabilities. In this dissertation, the author proposes a system based on this technology called Blind Guide. Blind Guide is an artifact that helps blind people to navigate in indoors or outdoors scenarios. The prototype is portable assuring that can be used anytime and anywhere. The system is composed of wireless sensors {{that can be used in}} different parts of the body. The sensors detect an obstacle and inform the user with an audible warning providing a <b>safety</b> <b>walk</b> to the users. A great feature about Blind Guide is its modularity. The system can adapt to the needs of the user and can be used in a combination with other solution. For example, Blind Guide can be used in conjunction with the white cane. The white cane detects obstacles below waist level and a Blind Guide wireless sensor in the forehead can detect obstacles at the head level. This feature is important because some sightless people feel uncomfortable without the white cane. The system is scalable giving us the opportunity to create a network of interconnected Blind Guide users. This network can store the exact location and description of the obstacles found by the users. This information is public for all users of this system. This feature reduces the time required for obstacle detection and consequent energy savings, thus increasing the autonomy of the solution. One of the main requirements for the development of this prototype was to design a low-cost solution that can be accessible for anyone around the world. All the components of the solution can provide a low-cost solution, easily obtainable and at a low cost. Technology makes our life easier and it must be available for anyone. Modularity, portability, scalability, the possibility to work in conjunction with other solutions, detecting objects that other solutions cannot, obstacle labeling, a network of identified obstacles and audible warnings are the main aspects of the Blind Guide system. All these aspects makes Blind Guide an anytime, anywhere solution for blind people. Blind Guide was tested with a group of volunteers. The volunteers were sightless and from different ages. The trials performed to the system show us positive results. The system successfully detected incoming obstacles and informed in real time to its users. The volunteers gave us a positive feedback telling that they felt comfortable using the prototype and they believe that the system can help them with their daily routine...|$|E

It was an awkward sort of thing to do, certainly, but Sir Thomas was convinced in his own mind that he ought to do it.

Police reports indicated that Thomas, who was driving, was speeding at approximately 100 m.p.h. even though snow and ice were accumulating on the roadway. Thomas continued weaving erratically through traffic until {{the time of the}} accident. Thomas and one of the passengers were not wearing seat belts and both were thrown from the car; the passenger was killed instantly. The second passenger, who was wearing his <b>safety</b> belt, <b>walked</b> away from the scene uninjured. Thomas was left paralyzed from the chest down. By early February, Thomas was being treated at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital. The morning of February 8, 2000, while being transferred from his hospital bed to a wheelchair on his way to therapy, Thomas told his mother he was not feeling well. His eyes then rolled back, recalled Frank Eismont, an orthopedic surgeon at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Eismont said Thomas went into cardiorespiratory arrest and {{died as a result of}} a pulmonary embolism, a massive blood clot that developed in his legs and traveled to his lungs. Months later, Thomas' family sued General Motors for $73 million in damages stemming from the accident. In 2004, a jury ruled that the family was not entitled to any money.|$|R
