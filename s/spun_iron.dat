Schreiber, G. Renger, W. Lubitz, V. A. Shuvalov, FEBS Lett. 377 (1995) 325 – 329). Here we have further investigated {{the origin of this}} signal. A slow formation of the signal during storage in the dark is observed in oxygen-evolving PSII membranes, which correlate with the oxidation of Fe 2 + by plastosemiquinone or oxygen. Removal of oxygen inhibits formation of the high <b>spin</b> <b>iron</b> signal. The g= 6 EPR signal is photoreduced at cryogenic temperatures and is restored slowly by subsequent dark storage at 77 K. The amplitude of the photoreduced signal increases as the pH is lowered, which shows that the origin is not the hydroxyl ligated Cyt b 559 species proposed previously. Different cryoprotectants also influence the amplitude and lineshape of the high <b>spin</b> <b>iron</b> signal in a manner suggesting that smaller cryoprotectants can penetrate the iron environment. A correlation between the high <b>spin</b> <b>iron</b> and g= 1. 6 EPR signal assigned to an interaction involving the semiquinones of Qa and Qb is shown.

40|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>spin</b> {{transition}} directly affects {{properties of}} lower mantle minerals and can thus alter geophysical and geochemical {{characteristics of the}} deep Earth. While the spin transition in ferropericlase has been vigorously established at P ~ 60 GPa and 300 K, experimental evidence for spin transitions in other rock-forming minerals, such as bridgmanite and post-perovskite, remains controversial. Multiple valence, spin, and coordination states of iron in bridgmanite and post-perovskite are difficult to resolve with conventional spin-probing techniques. Optical spectroscopy, on the other hand, is sensitive to high/low <b>spin</b> ferrous/ferric <b>iron</b> at different sites; thus, {{it can be a}} powerful probe for spin transitions. Here we establish the optical signature of low spin Fe 3 +O 6, a plausible low spin unit in bridgmanite and post-perovskite, by optical absorption experiments in diamond anvil cells. We show that the optical absorption of Fe 3 +O 6 in NAL (new aluminous phase) is very sensitive to the <b>iron</b> <b>spin</b> state and represents a model behavior of bridgmanite and post-perovskite in the deep lower mantle across a spin transition. Specifically, an absorption band centered at ~ 19000 cm- 1 is characteristic of the 2 T 2 g to 2 T 1 g (2 A 2 g) transition in low spin Fe 3 + in NAL at 40 GPa. This new spectroscopic information constrains the crystal field splitting energy of low spin Fe 3 + to ~ 22200 cm- 1 which we also independently confirm by our first-principles calculations. Together with available information on the electronic structure of Fe 3 +O 6 -compounds, we constrain the spin-pairing energy of Fe 3 + in an octahedral field to ~ 20000 - 23000 cm- 1. This implies that octahedrally-coordinated Fe 3 + in bridgmanite is low spin at P > ~ 40 GPa. Comment: 15 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

We address the influence of iron concentration and configuration (structural and magnetic), as well as techni-cal {{issues such as the}} influence of the exchange correlation functional (LDA versus GGA) on the spin transition pressure. Supercells containing up to 160 atoms were adopted to tackle these issues. We show that there are preferred configurations for high-spin and low-spin iron and that the spin transition pressure depends strongly on iron concentration and all the issues above. Across the <b>spin</b> transition, <b>irons</b> move into the middle of distorted octahedra causing drastic changes in the d states configuration and a blueshift in the band gap.

We found that in the reaction center from Rba. sphaeroides it exists in two forms, high and low spin ferrous states, whereas in Rsp. rubrum mostly in a low spin state, in line with our earlier finding of its low spin state in the algal photosystem II reaction center (Burda et al., 2003). The temperature dependence of the non-heme iron displacement studied by Mössbauer spectroscopy shows that the surrounding of the high <b>spin</b> <b>iron</b> is more flexible (Debye temperature ~ 165 K) {{than that of the}} low spin atom (~ 207 K). Nuclear inelastic scattering measurements of the collective motions in the Rba. sphaeroides reaction center show that the density of vibrational states, originating from non-heme iron, has well-separated modes between lower (4 – 17 meV) and higher (17 – 25 meV) energies while in the one from Rsp. rubrum its distribution is more uniform with only little contribution of low energy (~ 6 meV) vibrations. It is the first experimental evidence that the fluctuations of the protein matrix in type II reaction center are correlated to the spin state of non-heme iron. We propose a simple mechanism in which the spin state of non-heme iron directly determines the strength of coupling between the two quinone acceptors (QA and QB) and fast collective motions of protein matrix that {{play a crucial role in}} activation and regulation of the electron and proton transfer between these two quinones.

Here we have carried out a comparative study of the pressure-induced spin transition in compounds with trivalent iron, octahedrally coordinated by oxygen. High-pressure single-crystal Mössbauer spectroscopy data for FeBO_ 3, Fe_ 2 O_ 3 and Fe_ 3 (Fe_ 1. 766 (2) Si_ 0. 234 (2)) (SiO_ 4) _ 3 are presented together with detailed analysis of hyperfine parameter behavior. We argue that ζ-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 is an intermediate phase in the reconstructive phase transition between ι-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 and θ-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 and question the proposed perovskite-type structure for ζ-Fe_ 2 O_ 3. The structural data show that the spin transition is closely related to the volume of the iron octahedron. The transition starts when volumes reach 8. 9 - 9. 3 Å^ 3, which corresponds to pressures of 45 - 60 GPa, depending on the compound. Based on phenomenological arguments we conclude that the spin transition can proceed only as a first-order phase transition in magnetically-ordered compounds. An empirical rule for prediction of cooperative behavior at the spin transition is proposed. The instability of iron octahedra, together with strong interactions between them {{in the vicinity of the}} critical volume, may trigger a phase transition in the metastable phase.
