500|$|Designer Robert Fletcher {{was brought}} in to {{redesign}} existing costumes and create new ones. Fletcher decided on a scheme of [...] "corrupt colors", using materials with colors slightly off from the pure color. [...] "They're not colors you see today, so in a subtle way their indicate another time." [...] Meyer did not like the Starfleet uniforms from either the television series or The Motion Picture and wanted them changed, but for budgetary reasons they could not be discarded entirely. Dye tests of the fabric showed that the old uniforms took three colors well: blue-gray, gold, and dark red. Fletcher decided to use the dark red due to the strong contrast it provided with the background. The resulting naval-inspired designs would be used in Star Trek films until [...] (1996). The first versions of the uniforms had stiff black collars, but Sallin suggested changing it to a turtleneck, using a form of vertical quilting called trapunto. The method creates a bas-relief effect to the material by stuffing the outlined areas with <b>soft</b> <b>thread</b> shot via air pressure through a hollow needle. By the time of The Wrath of Khans production, the machines and needles needed to produce trapunto were rare, and Fletcher was only able to find one needle for the wardrobe department. The crew was so worried about losing or breaking the needle that one of the department's workers took it home with him as a security measure, leading Fletcher to think it had been stolen.|$|E
60|$|One of my plants bore two shoots near together, and the tendrils were {{repeatedly}} drawn {{across one}} another, {{but it is}} a singular fact that they did not once catch each other. It would appear as if they had become habituated to contact of this kind, for the pressure thus caused must have been much greater than that caused by a loop of <b>soft</b> <b>thread</b> weighing only the one-sixteenth of a grain. I have, however, seen several tendrils of Bryonia dioica interlocked, but they subsequently released one another. The tendrils of the Echinocystis are also habituated to drops of water or to rain; for artificial rain made by violently flirting a wet brush over them produced not the least effect.|$|E
60|$|Both {{branches}} of the tendril, whilst young, are highly sensitive. A touch with a pencil, so gentle as only just to move a tendril borne {{at the end of}} a long flexible shoot, sufficed to cause it to become perceptibly curved in four or five minutes. It became straight again in rather above one hour. A loop of <b>soft</b> <b>thread</b> weighing one-seventh of a grain (9.25 mg.) was thrice tried, and each time caused the tendril to become curved in 30 or 40 m. Half this weight produced no effect. The long foot-stalk is much less sensitive, for a slight rubbing produced no effect, although prolonged contact with a stick caused it to bend. The two branches are sensitive on all sides, so that they converge if touched on their inner sides, and diverge if touched on their outer sides. If a branch be touched at the same time with equal force on opposite sides, both sides are equally stimulated and there is no movement. Before examining this plant, I had observed only tendrils which are sensitive on one side alone, and these when lightly pressed between the finger and thumb become curved; but on thus pinching many times the tendrils of the Cissus no curvature ensued, and I falsely inferred at first that they were not at all sensitive.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, while {{going over}} the antique batiks and {{textiles}} she had collected {{since the age of}} 17, Obin was inspired to explore the crafting techniques that had gone into them, and developed her own hand-weaving and printing methods to enable her to create her own original fabrics. She also questioned why, despite her love for traditional textiles and cloths, there were no new patterns and designs. Through combining brand new motifs with traditional weaving techniques and methods using <b>softer</b> <b>threads</b> to create fabrics that could be batiked, Obin created completely unique yet totally Indonesian fabrics that did not rely on imported cotton and chiffons.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper proposes an {{architecture}} for concurrent scheduling of hard, soft and non real-time threads in embedded systems. It {{is based on}} a superscalar in-order processor binary compatible to the Infineon TriCore. The architecture allows a tight static WCET analysis of hard real-time threads. To provide high performance anyway, the absence of speculative elements like branch prediction and out-of-order execution is compensated by multithreading, transforming the processor into an in-order SMT processor. The Priority Controller that manages the scheduling is able (1) to assign fixed portions of time to hard real-time threads, (2) to control the IPC of <b>soft</b> real-time <b>threads</b> and (3) to fairly distribute execution cycles to non real-time threads. It is located within a separate unit outside the pipeline to avoid prolonging the critical path. We evaluate the processor using the EEMBC automotive benchmarks and show that the overlapping of two <b>soft</b> real-time <b>threads</b> can be used to either reduce the clock rate by 23 % or to grant each thread 65 % of its single-threaded IPC. Even if a hard real-time thread is executed predominantly, the remaining resources can be used by concurrent <b>soft</b> real-time <b>threads</b> which reach a performance of 70 % compared to their single-threaded execution...|$|R

60|$|When {{the stem}} is secured, the tendrils {{are seen to}} revolve in nearly the same manner {{and at the same}} rate as the internodes. {34} The tendrils are very thin, delicate, and straight, with the {{exception}} of the tips, which are a little curved; they are from 7 to 9 inches in length. A half-grown tendril is not sensitive; but when nearly full- grown they are extremely sensitive. A single delicate touch on the concave surface of the tip soon caused one to curve; and in 2 minutes it formed an open helix. A loop of <b>soft</b> <b>thread</b> weighing one thirty- second of a grain (2.02 mg.) placed most gently on the tip, thrice caused distinct curvature. A bent bit of thin platina wire weighing only fiftieth of a grain (1.23 mg.) twice produced the same effect; but this latter weight, when left suspended, did not suffice to cause a permanent curvature. These trials were made under a bell-glass, so that the loops of thread and wire were not agitated by the wind. The movement after a touch is very rapid: I took hold of the lower part of several tendrils, and then touched their concave tips with a thin twig and watched them carefully through a lens; the tips evidently began to bend after the following intervals--31, 25, 32, 31, 28, 39, 31, and 30 seconds; so that the movement was generally perceptible in half a minute after a touch; but on one occasion it was distinctly visible in 25 seconds. One of the tendrils which thus became bent in 31 seconds, had been touched two hours previously and had coiled into a helix; so that in this interval it had straightened itself and had perfectly recovered its irritability.|$|E
60|$|Passiflora punctata.--The internodes do not move, but the tendrils revolve regularly. A half-grown {{and very}} {{sensitive}} tendril made three revolutions, {{opposed to the}} course of the sun, in 3 hrs. 5 m., 2 hrs. 40 m. and 2 hrs. 50 m.; perhaps it might have travelled more quickly when nearly full-grown. A plant was placed in front of a window, and, as with twining stems, the light accelerated the movement of the tendril in one direction and retarded it in the other; the semicircle towards the light being performed in one instance in 15 m. less time and in a second instance in 20 m. less time than that required by the semicircle towards the dark end of the room. Considering the extreme tenuity of these tendrils, the action of the light on them is remarkable. The tendrils are long, and, as just stated, very thin, with the tip slightly curved or hooked. The concave side is extremely sensitive to a touch--even a single touch causing it to curl inwards; it subsequently straightened itself, and was again ready to act. A loop of <b>soft</b> <b>thread</b> weighing one fourteenth of a grain (4.625 mg.) caused the extreme tip to bend; another time I tried to hang the same little loop on an inclined tendril, but three times it slid off; yet this extraordinarily slight degree of friction sufficed to make the tip curl. The tendril, though so sensitive, does not move very quickly after a touch, no conspicuous movement being observable until 5 or 10 m. had elapsed. The convex side of the tip is not sensitive to a touch or to a suspended loop of thread. On one occasion I observed a tendril revolving with the convex side of the tip forwards, and in consequence it was not able to clasp a stick, against which it scraped; whereas tendrils revolving with the concave side forward, promptly seize any object in their path.|$|E
6000|$|Finally, {{it is an}} {{extraordinary}} fact {{that a little bit}} of <b>soft</b> <b>thread,</b> 1/50 of an inch in length and weighing 1/8197 of a grain, or of a human hair, 8/1000 of an inch in length and weighing only 1/78740 of a grain (.000822 milligramme), or particles of precipitated chalk, after resting for a short time on a gland, should induce some change in its cells, exciting them [page 33] to transmit a motor impulse throughout the whole length of the pedicel, consisting of about twenty cells, to near its base, causing this part to bend, and the tentacle to sweep through an angle of above 180o. That the contents of the cells of the glands, and afterwards those of the pedicels, are affected in a plainly visible manner by the pressure of minute particles, we shall have abundant evidence when we treat of the aggregation of protoplasm. But the case is much more remarkable than as yet stated; for the particles are supported by the viscid and dense secretion; nevertheless, even smaller ones than those of which the measurements have been given, when brought by an insensibly slow movement, through the means above specified, into contact with the surface of a gland, act on it, and the tentacle bends. The pressure exerted by the particle of hair, weighing only 1/78740 of a grain and supported by a dense fluid, must have been inconceivably slight. We may conjecture that it could hardly have equalled the millionth of a grain; and we shall hereafter see that far less than the millionth of a grain of phosphate of ammonia in solution, when absorbed by a gland, acts on it and induces movement. A bit of hair, 1/50 of an inch in length, and therefore much larger than those used in the above experiments, was not perceived when placed on my tongue; and it is extremely doubtful whether any nerve in the human body, even if in an inflamed condition, would be in any way affected by such a particle supported in a dense fluid, and slowly brought into contact with the nerve. Yet the cells of the glands of Drosera are thus excited to transmit a motor impulse to a distant point, inducing movement. It appears to me that hardly any more remarkable fact than this has been observed in the vegetable kingdom. [page 34] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Recent biomechanical {{studies have}} shown that an {{anatomic}} double-bundle posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction is superior in restoring normal knee laxity compared with the conventional single-bundle isometric reconstruction. We describe a modification of an endoscopic PCL reconstruction technique using a double-bundle Y-shaped hamstring tendon graft. A double- or triple-bundle semitendinosus-gracilis tendon graft is used and directly fixed with <b>soft</b> <b>threaded</b> biodegradable interference screws. In the medial femoral condyle, 2 femoral tunnels are created inside-out through a low anterolateral arthroscopic portal. First, in 80 ° of flexion, the double-stranded gracilis graft is fixed with an interference screw inside the lower femoral socket, representing the insertion site of the posteromedial bundle. In full extension the combined semitendinosus-gracilis graft is pretensioned and fixed inside the posterior aspect of the single tibial tunnel. The double- or triple-stranded semitendinosus tendon is inserted in the higher femoral tunnel, presenting the insertion site of the anterolateral bundle. Finally, pretension is applied to the semitendinosus bundle in 70 ° of flexion and a third screw is inserted. Using this technique, the stronger semitendinosus part of the double-bundle graft, which mimics the anterolateral bundle of the PCL, is fixed in flexion, whereas the smaller gracilis tendon part (posteromedial bundle) is fixed in full extension.

60|$|Summary on Leaf-climbers.--Plants {{belonging}} to eight families {{are known to}} have clasping petioles, and plants {{belonging to}} four families climb by the tips of their leaves. In all the species observed by me, with one exception, the young internodes revolve more or less regularly, in some cases as regularly as those of a twining plant. They revolve at various rates, in most cases rather rapidly. Some few can ascend by spirally twining round a support. Differently from most twiners, there is a strong tendency in the same shoot to revolve first in one and then in an opposite direction. The object gained by the revolving movement is to bring the petioles or the tips of the leaves into contact with surrounding objects; and without this aid the plant would be much less successful in climbing. With rare exceptions, the petioles are sensitive only whilst young. They are sensitive on all sides, but in different degrees in different plants; and in some species of Clematis the several parts of the same petiole differ much in sensitiveness. The hooked tips of the leaves of the Gloriosa are sensitive only on their inner or inferior surfaces. The petioles are sensitive to a touch and to excessively slight continued pressure, even from a loop of <b>soft</b> <b>thread</b> weighing only the one- sixteenth of a grain (4.05 mg.); and {{there is reason to believe}} that the rather thick and stiff petioles of Clematis flammula are sensitive to even much less weight if spread over a wide surface. The petioles always bend towards the side which is pressed or touched, at different rates in different species, sometimes within a few minutes, but generally after a much longer period. After temporary contact with any object, the petiole continues to bend for a considerable time; afterwards it slowly becomes straight again, and can then re-act. A petiole excited by an extremely slight weight sometimes bends a little, and then becomes accustomed to the stimulus, and either bends no more or becomes straight again, the weight still remaining suspended. Petioles which have clasped an object for some little time cannot recover their original position. After remaining clasped for two or three days, they generally increase much in thickness either throughout their whole diameter or on one side alone; they subsequently become stronger and more woody, sometimes to a wonderful degree; and in some cases they acquire an internal structure like that of the stem or axis.|$|E

50|$|Blonde lace is a {{continuous}} bobbin lace from France {{that is made}} of silk. The term blonde refers to the natural color of the silk thread. Originally this lace was made with the natural-colored silk, and later in black. Most blonde lace was also made in black. It {{was made in the}} 18th and 19th centuries. The pattern, which is generally of flowers, is made with a <b>soft</b> silk <b>thread,</b> thicker than the thread used for the ground. This causes a big contrast between the flowers and the ground. It uses the same stitches as Chantilly lace and Lille lace, and is similarly made in strips 5 inches wide and invisibly joined.

40|$|Design and {{analysis}} of real-time systems is heavily based on knowing worst-case execution times (WCET) of periodic threads and aperiodic servers. Accurately measuring WCET, however, is often difficult and sometimes impossible, for several reasons: •Interrupts in the system, which either execute longer than expected or occur more frequently than anticipated may steal critical execution time from the highest priority threads. •Variations in processing speed due to caching, pipelining, and bus arbitration may alter WCET. •There is {{no easy way to}} accurately measure execution times of embedded code. As long as scheduling policies are based on WCET, these difficulties in measuring WCET inevitably lead to timing errors in the system. Many of these errors go undetected until more catastrophic failures occur, and others result in the system failing to meet its specifications, but with non-obvious reasons as to the cause of such failures. We have created low-overhead policy-independent real-time operating system (RTOS) mechanisms, which detect and handle these types of timing errors. The mechanisms can be used with a variety of common scheduling algorithms, and {{serve as the basis for}} easily extending these policies to incorporate aperiodic servers, <b>soft</b> real-time <b>threads,</b> imprecise computations, and adaptive real-time scheduling. The mechanisms have been incorporated into the Chimera RTOS[9]...|$|R
40|$|Purpose — In {{order to}} {{optimize}} {{the performance of the}} suture for tissue closure, it is essential to develop strategies for devising new and improved techniques that can visualize and compare various suturing techniques. This paper describes an experimental and numerical investigation on the performance of sutured tissue. Methods — In the experiments, two pieces of glutaraldehyde cross-linked bovine pericardium were sutured together through simple running suture and tensioned to study the performance of the sutured tissue. During testing, the tension load and the total displacement of the specimen were recorded. The strain field of the specimen was simultaneously captured using two high speed cameras and post processed using its associated image processing software. In addition, nonlinear hyperelastic material models for Shelhigh patch and cryopreserved human aorta were derived through least-square fitting into the tensile testing data. Three dimensional finite element models were developed to replicate the behavior of wound closure. Results — The effect of tissue material mismatch, and stiffness of the suture thread on the mechanical behavior of sutured tissue was examined. The stain distributions obtained from simulation agrees with the captured surface strain map from experiments. A relative <b>softer</b> suture <b>thread</b> could reduce the peak stress concentrations at the knotting location. Conclusions — The mechanical performance of sutured tissue depends on the level of mismatch in material stiffness between the native tissue and the replacement materia...|$|R
40|$|In cyber-physical systems, where {{embedded}} computation {{interacts with}} physical processes, correctness depends on timing behavior, not just functionality. For high {{confidence in the}} timing behavior of real-time embedded software, the underlying hardware must support predictable and isolated task execution. These properties are sacrificed in many conventional processors that use frequent interrupts and hardware prediction mechanisms to improve average-case performance. Mixed-criticality systems—where tasks with different levels of safety criticality are integrated on a single hardware platform to share resources and reduce costs—facilitate complex functionality but further complicate design and verification. The challenge is designing processor architectures that provide high confidence in software functionality and timing behavior without sacrificing processor throughput. This dissertation presents architectural techniques for task-level trade-offs between predictability, hardware-based isolation, and overall instruction throughput—facilitating the verification of safety-critical tasks and allowing software to meet precise timing constraints. Our processor design, named FlexPRET, uses fine-grained multithreading with flexible hard- ware thread scheduling and integrated timers to evaluate these techniques. With no restrictions on thread interleaving, the hardware thread scheduler executes hard real-time threads (HRTTs) at specific cycles for isolated and predictable behavior and allows <b>soft</b> real-time <b>threads</b> (SRTTs) to use both specific and spare cycles for efficient operation. A configurable version of FlexPRET is implemented in simulation and on FPGA using Chisel, a hardware construction language that generates both C++ and Verilog code. For a given program path at a constant thread scheduling frequency, the latency of every instruction is constant and known, and the precision of input/output (I/O) instruction timing is bounded. The comparison of FlexPRET with two baseline processors provides the FPGA resource costs of FlexPRET’s microarchitectural features. Using two example applications, we demonstrate a mixed-criticality deployment methodology that provides hardware-based isolation to critical tasks and improves overall instruction throughput by using spare cycles and software scheduling for less critical tasks. FlexPRET can also use software to perform multiple independent I/O operations instead of requiring hardware peripherals...|$|R
60|$|All tendrils are sensitive, but {{in various}} degrees, to {{contact with an}} object, and curve towards the touched side. With several plants a single touch, so slight as only just to move the highly {{flexible}} tendril, is enough to induce curvature. Passiflora gracilis possesses the most sensitive tendrils which I have observed: a bit of platina wire 0.02 of a grain (1.23 mg.) in weight, gently placed on the concave point, caused a tendril to become hooked, as did a loop of <b>soft,</b> thin cotton <b>thread</b> weighing one thirty-second of a grain (2.02 mg.) With the tendrils of several other plants, loops weighing one sixteenth of a grain (4.05 mg.) sufficed. The point of a tendril of Passiflora gracilis began to move distinctly in 25 seconds after a touch, {{and in many cases}} after 30 seconds. Asa Gray also saw movement in the tendrils of the Cucurbitaceous genus, Sicyos, in 30 seconds. The tendrils of some other plants, when lightly rubbed, moved in a few minutes; with Dicentra in half-an- hour; with Smilax in an hour and a quarter or half; and with Ampelopsis still more slowly. The curling movement consequent on a single touch continues to increase for a considerable time, then ceases; after a few hours the tendril uncurls itself, and is again ready to act. When the tendrils of several kinds of plants were caused to bend by extremely light weights suspended on them, they seemed to grow accustomed to so slight a stimulus, and straightened themselves, as if the loops had been removed. It makes no difference what sort of object a tendril touches, with the remarkable exception of other tendrils and drops of water, as was observed with the extremely sensitive-tendrils of Passiflora gracilis and of the Echinocystis. I have, however, seen tendrils of the Bryony which had temporarily caught other tendrils, and often {{in the case of the}} vine.|$|R
40|$|I did {{not present}} at the conference. I was merely an attendee. The format of the conference was three rooms, and each room had a (usually) one hour {{presentation}} on a specific topic each hour from about 10 AM to 10 PM. Given the format, {{it was not possible}} to see all presentations. Let me say that I greatly appreciate the opportunity the A&PDF committee has provided me to attend this conference. The conference was educational, thought provoking, informative, and inspiring, if a little fear-inducing at times. The technical presentations that were most related to my job as a systems administrator at AU were "IPv 6 Playground", and "Wireless Security" (one of the presenters of the wireless security talk, Renderman, who I spoke with, is from Edmonton). The keynote talk by Dan Kaminsky, who literally holds one of seven keys that secure the Internet’s domain name system, was also quite technical. The IPv 6 discussion was illuminating in terms of how powerful a technology it is, how important, and how slow it’s adoption. I look forward to AU implementing IPv 6. Wireless Security was also very interesting in terms of how difficult it would be to efficiently secure a wireless network. Kaminsky’s talk went over several items, starting from the concept that the Internet was never designed for authentication (e. g [...] paraphrasing Kaminsky: “who cares about SVG resizing in the browser if we can’t securely handle authenticated sessions”) and that security considerations are brought too late into the design stage (”life is too short to defend broken code” says Kaminsky) to eventually flowing down into some innovative security concepts, such as using base 64 to encode strings to avoid injection and the problems with escaping Unicode symbols. For better or worse, the theme of this years HOPE conference was less technical and more related to what could be considered techno-democracy. I don't know if the organizers of the conference realized it, or if any attendees would agree, but it certainly seemed that there was considerably less focus on hard technical issues and more of a focus on privacy, journalism (the failure of newspapers being a hot button topic), and freedom of information [...] what one could term "soft security" rather than hard, technical issues. Talks such as “Grand Theft Lazlow”, “Privacy is Dead”, “From Indymedia to Demand Media” and others concentrated on many of these themes. I believe these <b>soft</b> <b>threads</b> were more powerful than specific technology at the conference because of the paradigm shift that has been occurring in the area of privacy [...] and not just online privacy, but the rapid alteration [...] some would say “erosion” [...] of privacy norms worldwide, as well as related efforts to maintain privacy and anonymity anonymity (e. g. Tor, encryption, Trackmenot) while using the Internet. There was a lot of democracy at work here. Google was a discussion point for several presenters, mostly regarding online privacy. For example, the talk “Privacy is Dead - Get over it” (the speaker is a working, highly regarded private detective) endearingly termed Google as “the mothership,” meaning that whenever an Internet user does something on the Internet (often but not always) using a google service, personal information is “beamed back up to the mothership. ” Humorous but also accurate. Google, Facebook, etc, store and cross-reference a stunning amount of information about their users. Because computing is very good at cross referencing data, for example with Google’s in-house technology MapReduce and Facebook using Hadoop, it is relatively easy to learn a lot about a single person through the knitting together of many separate pieces of information. That information is worth billions and billions of dollars for targeted advertising (e. g. Google has a market capitalization of 160 billion dollars, and most of that value is based on a single Google product: Adwords). These are extremely valuable companies simply because of their user data. Probably the most interesting part of the conference was the Wikileaks keynote speech. Politically, this was a very timely happening. Regardless of what one thinks of Wikileaks and their politics, news-wise this was quite the event. Julian Assange, the most visible Wikileaks member, was scheduled to give a talk regarding Wikileaks. However, given recent happenings the US government [...] which was in attendance through representatives of Homeland Security and the FBI, among others [...] had indicated that they would like to “speak” with Mr. Assange, and it was generally felt that should Mr. Assange step into US territory he would be detained by said agencies. Thus Mr. Assange did not show up to do his talk, instead another Wikileaks member gave the presentation. Interestingly, as much as the conference regarded soft security issues, hard technical systems, such as Tor, public key encryption, etc, are very important to creating security and anonymity for Wikileaks [...] which heavily relies on advanced technology to acquire and maintain anonymous leaks. Life and death literally hangs on the use and implementation of these technologies. I believe the biggest thing to take away from a conference such as this is that there are many dedicated people independently researching security and privacy issues and that the knowledge they posses is still only circulating in rather small circles. The Internet has brought large scale, rapid change to many areas of humanity, some for better and some for worse, and many of the attendees are attempting [...] often on their own, often utilizing technology [...] to reconcile, understand, and communicate that change. It was good to be a part of the discussion. The main visual theme of the conference is visions of the future from the past, so things that reference The World’s Fairs, The Jetsons, flying cars, DaVinci, Asimov, and so forth would be very appropriate. However, projects are not required to carry the central theme in any way. Some projects, such as OpenAMD, are already being planned to be simply visions of the future from the present, rather than referencing any futurist thoughts from antiquity. Some projects already in the works include… The Attendee Meta-Data Project (“OpenAMD”) An expansion of the RFID crowd tracking project from The Last Hope. Needs programmers and hardware hackers, and is prime for spinoff projects. Many possibilities exist for the development of games, data mining, and visualizations. Ask about the OpenAMD API.

Installations must be technology-based. They can range from electrical experiments to computer-controlled machines, to data and information processing visualizations, they can be static or interactive, and they could be visual or musical, this is a very open field. This is an unpaid exhibition, but the selected installation artists will be given free admission to the conference, and an online gallery with artist biographies will be set up for promotional purposes.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} more {{automated}} process for drawing and twisting of graphene fibers than was currently in place. This was implemented by having two chemical baths with variable speed rollers at either end, and intermediate roller to spool fiber between stages, and a twisting cylinder with integral spool to twist the fiber as it is collected. The goal was to have this first iteration deliver a working prototype, however due to manufacturing delays and timing constraints, that will be missed. A second follow-on project would be able to continue the work presented here and fulfil the stated aims of the project. The bulk of the structure is fabricated from PVC pieces waterjet cut from a large sheet. This allowed for quick manufacture of most pieces in the design. From there, some secondary machining was done to add mounting and fastening locations. PVC pieces were attached to one another primarily through the use of # 8 - 32 screws with washers and a brass threaded insert. Due to PVC being a <b>soft</b> material, tapping <b>threads</b> into it directly was avoided. The baths were sealed mostly with an automotive gasket compound to permanently seal one half, while one wall was sealed with a silicon gasket laser cut from a sheet. This makes the bath wall removable for maintenance. Two baths were made to allow multiple stages of drawing or one coagulation stage immediately followed by a drawing stage. From the drawing, the fiber advances to the auxiliary roller. The range of speeds required to get desired properties at all stages did not permit the fiber to go from coagulation to drawing to twisting in one process, therefore following the drawing bath, it is wound on to the auxiliary roller. After the drawing process is finished, the fiber can be pulled from the auxiliary roller into the twisting mechanism, running at a lower speed so as to give the requisite number of turns per length of fiber to yield the optimal fiber twist angle. The twisting mechanism is a PVC cylinder supported on horizontal rods and driven by a motor mounted beneath the cylinder and connected via a plastic belt. The cylinder, motor, and support rods are encased in a box with one face open to allow the fiber into the cylinder. Inside the cylinder is a spinning rod mounted across the diameter that collects the fiber as it is twisted. The aim of the project called for a quick-release mechanism so that the rod can be removed quickly for storage of the fiber or other testing steps. All of the motion is powered by small 5 V DC motors that go through a 20 : 1 worm gear reduction. This increases the torque while decreasing the speed from roughly 10, 000 RPM to more useful ranges. The motors are powered through a NPN power transistor with the logic being controlled by an Arduino Nano that takes in an analog voltage and converts it to a PWM waveform to control the motor duty cycle. In total, the project came in under budget, using 84. 01 % of the $ 1500 allocated for the project. A third of this cost came from the need to expedite the waterjet cutting by going to a third-party outside of the campus community. Had on campus resources been successfully utilized, the total cost would have been closer to the $ 925. 38 estimate first presented...|$|R
