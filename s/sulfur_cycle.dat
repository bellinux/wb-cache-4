40|$|A recuperative bayonet reactor {{design for}} the {{high-temperature}} sulfuric acid decomposition step in sulfur-based thermochemical hydrogen cycles was evaluated using pinch analysis in conjunction with statistical methods. The objective was to establish the minimum energy requirement. Taking hydrogen production via alkaline electrolysis with nuclear power as the benchmark, the acid decomposition step can consume no more than 450 kJ/mol SO{sub 2 } for <b>sulfur</b> <b>cycles</b> to be competitive. The lowest value of the minimum heating target, 320. 9 kJ/mol SO{sub 2 }, was found at the highest pressure (90 bar) and peak process temperature (900 C) considered, and at a feed concentration of 42. 5 mol% H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 }. This should be low enough for a practical water-splitting process, even including the additional energy required to concentrate the acid feed. Lower temperatures consistently gave higher minimum heating targets. The lowest peak process temperature that could meet the 450 -kJ/mol SO{sub 2 } benchmark was 750 C. If the decomposition reactor were to be heated indirectly by an advanced gas-cooled reactor heat source (50 C temperature difference between primary and secondary coolants, 25 C minimum temperature difference between the secondary coolant and the process), then <b>sulfur</b> <b>cycles</b> using this concept could be competitive with alkaline electrolysis provided the primary heat source temperature is at least 825 C.

The DNA recovered in the ICDP cores suggests that different microbial assemblages are associated with particular sedimentary facies, regardless of their depth and in situ salinity. Since this facies are controlled by changes in the evaporation-precipitation ratio in the region, our data suggest that subsurface microbial assemblages are themselves highly influenced by climatic variations at the time of sedimentation. In particular, humid periods allow the development of varied metabolisms such as sulfate reduction, methanogenesis and potentially anaerobic methane oxidation, deeply influencing the carbon and <b>sulfur</b> <b>cycles</b> of the lake, and subsequently allowing the formation of diagenetic Fe-S minerals.
