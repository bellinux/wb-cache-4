Concerns that negative impacts might be {{brought about by}} prosperous tourism {{have resulted in a}} recent focus on sustainable tourism. Sustainable tourism involves policies that acknowledge the interdependences among the environment, the community, and the economy. The goal of sustainable tourism is to enhance and protect the environment while satisfying basic human requirements, {{as well as those of}} the contemporary and future tourism industries to improve quality of life. On the other hand, unsustainable <b>coastal</b> <b>tourism</b> might undermine the natural environment and society, resulting in air, water, and soil pollution, wildlife habitat disruption, and changes of local community cultural characteristics. Therefore, performance evaluation of <b>coastal</b> <b>tourism,</b> using an indicator framework to facilitate sustainable development and enhance the effectiveness of coastal resources exploitation, is critical. Through a literature review and expert surveys using the methods of the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) and the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), this study builds a performance indicator framework and identifies the key factors affecting the <b>sustainable</b> development of <b>coastal</b> <b>tourism</b> in Taiwan.

A solution to this problem will be presented through a novel approach to tourism management using a combination of Factor Analysis, Adaptive Management, and a modified DPSIR (Driver- Pressure, State, Impact, Response) framework, based on community perception. The approach will provide a pragmatic framework for sustainable tourism development and is especially applicable when recognizing the complex and adaptive nature of tourism as a social-ecological system. This analysis will focus on sustainable tourism theory actualization at a regional scale (Northern Vancouver Island, BC, Canada). The identified latent variables (factors) indicate a common origin of impact perception, thus factors can be used to identify common pressures in the causal nexus to develop proactive and long-term responses.

The QualityCoast programme for tourism destinations aims to reflect the willingness of a region to highlight nature and landscape, carrying capacity, cultural heritage and aspects of sustainable tourism in its marketing programme targeting domestic or international visitors. The implementation of the QualityCoast programme is determined using a series of Tourism Quality Milestones (TQMs), which indicate the quality of information available to visitors. A provisional list of 30 TQMs was selected, and these TQMs were grouped into the thematic areas: nature; carrying capacity; water and environmental quality; and socio-economics.

Three water samples were collected with three sterilized plastic containers with a capacity of 25 cl which were subjected to laboratory tests to know their constituents. The parameters tested were appearance temperature colour turbidity conductivity PH alkalinity lead Pb Chromium Cr Cadmium Cd Ammonia BODs and Dissolved Oxygen. The results of the water samples were compared with World Health Organization WHO water quality standard and the Nigeria National Water Quality standard to determine the safety of the water for human consumption and tourism development. The study revealed that Port Harcourt site has more prospects for tourism development more than Opobo study site because the Ph alkalinity and BODs levels were lower than that of Opobo making the water safer except that the amount of dissolved oxygen was a little high in Opobo and turbidity was not detected in Opobo. The study revealed that Bonny water was very dense in appearance dark brown in colour highly turbid basic and with mean concentration of the heavy metals Lead chromium and cadmium higher than the recommended World Health Organization WHO water quality standard and the Nigeria National Water Quality standard and therefore not safe for drinking and swimming.

There are four patterns of management of coastal tourism destinatyion in Bali, nemaly, (1) Pattern of management by village tradition; (2) Pattern of management by village foundation; (3) Pattern of management by government authority/agency; and (4) Natural development (without pattern of management). The pattern of management by village tradition was applied in Kuta beach and Jimbaran beach in Badung regency. The pattern of management by village foundation was applied to manage of Sanur beach in Denpasar city. The pattern of management by government authority/agency was used to manage of Nusa Dua beach and surrounding in Badung regency. Meanwhile, natural development (without pattern of management) was used in many beaches in Bali, like Nusa Lembongan island beach in Klungkung regency.

40|$|In Southeast Asia, {{coastal tourism}} has grown rapidly and {{significantly}} {{over the past}} three decades. This trend is very likely to continue. While coastal tourism has brought considerable economic benefits to the host countries, the consequences of rapid and ad hoc coastal tourism development have not always been desirable. With the increasing awareness of the need for sustainable development to protect our global environment, the impact of rapid, unplanned growth of coastal tourism resorts has become a concern. Coastal tourism in Southeast Asia has become a focus for important research; but there has been little research addressing <b>sustainable</b> <b>coastal</b> <b>tourism</b> at the implementation or operational level. This research examines aspects of the dynamic growth of Southeast Asian coastal tourism development. Using case studies, it seeks objectively to evaluate the implementation of sustainability policies and planning in three rapidly developing coastal tourist areas—Boracay in the Philippines, Pattaya in Thailand and Sihanoukville in Cambodia. The study also identifies and describes some of the key sustainability issues relating to the development of beach resorts in the Southeast Asian region at different stages of their development, using the Beach Resort Model (BRM (Smith RA 1990) as a guiding framework. The intent is to highlight the aspects of contemporary resort growth that are not receiving adequate or appropriate attention from policy makers and planners. Analysis of these case studies has led {{to a better understanding of}} the planning issues central to coastal tourism development in Asia and has indicated ways of improving policies related to long-term environmental and cultural sustainability. This research employed the case study methodology to provide insight into the dynamics of coastal tourism development. Both primary and secondary data with qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to undertake the analyses. The primary data included personal interviews, survey questionnaires and site observations. A total of 185 personal interviews were conducted with community leaders, government officials and business operators working in or associated with the tourism industry. The secondary data included official statistics, data from government agencies, government policies, archival review of print and online media reports and historical data on tourism development. The analyses were conducted within a five-factor evaluation framework, based on the Agenda 21 Tourism Objectives and including the factors of environment and resource management; economic well-being and equity; community and socio-cultural well-being; policy and planning; and infrastructure and technology. These analyses assessed critical stakeholders’ perceptions of the effectiveness of sustainable tourism programs and their benefits for the stakeholders in the three cases. For each case, the dynamic coastal tourism urbanisation process over a period of five decades is described within the context of the Beach Resort Model. In addition, comparative analyses of the three cases are presented and discussed. The research findings highlight the relevance of applying the BRM in explaining the process of change in coastal tourism development and sustainability. The findings indicate that as coastal tourism destinations become more established, concerns about sustainability increase. Consequently, state intervention, in the form of the monitoring and regulation of development, becomes necessary as coastal destinations expand. This view is supported by the comparative study of the three cases, which not only describes coastal tourism development at specific destinations in terms of its sustainability, but also generalises the practices and problems in implementing sustainable policies common to the three cases. The comparative study reveals that, while there have been some successes in the implementation of sustainability programs—typically relating to the economic environment, the ‘visual’ environment and resource management—the concept of sustainability needs to be expanded beyond tourist numbers and visual cleanliness. Greater attention needs to be given to the social and cultural dimensions of sustainability within the context of governance. The research findings demonstrate the importance of good governance systems, which utilise knowledge sharing and technical assistance from non-government organisations and work to establish networks and partnerships among stakeholders and the local community in the move towards sustainability. The research concludes that coastal tourism needs to look ‘beyond the beach’ and economic sustainability and take a more holistic approach to sustainable development that encompasses human and social capital within the context of governance...|$|E
