5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, <b>sulfacetamide,</b> and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E
2500|$|When appropriate, {{the choice}} of {{antibiotic}} varies, differing based on the cause (if known) or the likely cause of the conjunctivitis. Fluoroquinolones, sodium <b>sulfacetamide,</b> or trimethoprim/polymyxin may be used, typically for 7â€“10 days. [...] Cases of meningococcal conjunctivitis can also be treated with systemic penicillin, {{as long as the}} strain is sensitive to penicillin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfacetamide</b> {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for use in the}} treatment of pityriasis versicolor and rosacea. It also has anti-inflammatory properties when used to treat blepharitis or conjunctivitis (in eye-drop solution). It is believed to work by limiting the presence of folic acid which bacteria need to survive. It has been suggested that <b>sulfacetamide</b> may also serve as a treatment for mild forms of hidradenitis suppurativa. <b>Sulfacetamide</b> has antibacterial activity and is used to control acne. Products containing <b>sulfacetamide</b> and sulfur (a keratolytic) are commonly promoted for the treatment of acne rosacea (rosacea with papules, pustules, or both). There are several prescription topical products containing <b>sulfacetamide,</b> such as foams, shampoos, cream and washes.|$|E
50|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{degradation of}} <b>sulfacetamide</b> in water solutions during illumination of UV radiation with TiO2 was examined. It {{was found that}} <b>sulfacetamide</b> is resistant to biodegradation {{and that it is}} toxic to the green alga Chlorella vulgaris. It undergoes photocatalytic degradation and the toxicity of the intermediate products is significantly lower than the initial toxicity (figure 1). The intermediates can be mineralized in contrast to <b>sulfacetamide.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfacetamide</b> as a {{medicine}} is available as: solution, eye drops, lotion and a powder. It {{can also be}} found in the form <b>sulfacetamide</b> sodium, which has a hydrated sodium group bound to it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfacetamide</b> is absorped orally. The oral {{absorption}} of <b>sulfacetamide</b> {{is found to}} be 100% and the plasma protein binding is 80-85%. In the liver it is metabolized to inactive metabolites. Plasma half-life is 7 - 12.8 hours.|$|E

50|$|Research {{proved that}} it is more toxic in the {{presence}} of light than in the dark. <b>Sulfacetamide</b> is slightly irritant when UV-A light is present. In the presence of light <b>sulfacetamide</b> gets sensitized and degraded which might cause irritation which will lead to toxicity when it is used continuously. In the dark only slight irritation has been shown. Therefore it should be stored in the dark.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfacetamide</b> is a sulfonamide antibiotic. Sulfonamides are {{synthetic}} bacteriostatic antibiotics, {{that are}} active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It blocks {{the synthesis of}} dihydrofolic acid by inhibiting the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase. It is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). PABA is required for bacterial synthesis of folic acid {{and it is an}} essential component for bacterial growth. The multiplication of bacteria is therefore inhibited by the action of <b>sulfacetamide.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sulfabenzamide is an antibacterial/antimicrobial. Often used in {{conjunction}} with sulfathiazole and <b>sulfacetamide</b> (trade name - Sultrin) as a topical, intravaginal antibacterial preparation.|$|E

50|$|The drug {{combination}} sulfacetamide/sulfur is a topical acne medication manufactured by Medicis under the trade name Plexion and also available under other trade {{names such as}} Clenia, Prascion, and Avar. It combines sodium <b>sulfacetamide,</b> a sulfonamide antibiotic, and sulfur, a keratolytic agent. It is available in four formulations: as a cleansing cloth, cleanser, topical suspension, and as a facial mask. The <b>sulfacetamide</b> inhibits {{the growth of the}} bacterium Propionibacterium acnes that is associated with acne, while sulfur facilitates the removal of dead skin cells to prevent clogged pores.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfacetamide</b> is {{synthesized}} {{either by}} direct alkylation of acetamide with 4-aminobenzenesulfonyl chloride, or by reacting 4-aminobenzenesulfonamide with acetic anhydride and subsequent selective, reductive deacylation of the resultant acetamide using {{a system of}} zinc-sodium hydroxide.|$|E
50|$|Microbial {{blepharitis}} {{is treated}} with antibiotics such as <b>sulfacetamide</b> eye ointment applied on a cotton applicator once daily to the lid margins. Ophthalmologists or optometrists may prescribe low-dose oral antibiotics such as Doxycycline and occasionally weak topical steroids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfacetamide</b> {{is stable}} under normal {{temperatures}} and pressures. No dangerous reactions occur under known conditions of normal use. It {{is an important}} bacteriostatic agent that is commonly used in human and veterinary medicine. Therefore it can accumulate in the environment (mostly surface water).|$|E
50|$|Sulfathiazole is an {{organosulfur}} compound {{used as a}} short-acting sulfa drug. It is {{an organic}} compound. Formerly, it was a common oral and topical antimicrobial, until less toxic alternatives were discovered.

50|$|Sulfonamides are {{generally}} against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. Specifically enteric bacteria and other eubacteria {{are affected by}} the antibiotic as it kills the bacteria by restricting the production of folic acid, which is essential for their growth. However strains of bacteria can be resistant to the antibiotic. If a bacterium is resistant to a sulfonamide, it is resistant to all the forms. Furthermore <b>sulfacetamide</b> is toxic to soil organisms.|$|E
5000|$|Antibiotics (if prescribed): To reduce lid margin {{bacteria}} to help control blepharitis {{caused by a}} bacterial infection, antibiotics such as erythromycin or <b>sulfacetamide</b> may be used via eyedrops, cream, or ointment on the eyelid margin. Oral medication is sometimes prescribed. If used by cream or ointment, after lid margin cleaning, spread small amount of prescription antibiotic ophthalmic ointment with finger tip along lid fissure while eyes closed. Use prior to bedtime to avoid blurry vision.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfacetamide</b> is a sulfonamide antibiotic, {{that is used}} as a {{cream to}} treat skin infections and as eye drops to treat eye infections. On the skin it is used to treat acne and {{seborrheic}} dermatitis. In cream form it is used to treat bacterial infections on the skin. It can also be used orally to treat urinary tract infections. It kills the bacteria by restricting the production of folic acid, which is essential for bacterial growth. It mainly inhibits the multiplication of bacteria as it acts in a competitive inhibitor.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Sulfacetamide</b> sodium is {{a widely}} used sulfonamide for {{ophthalmic}} infections. Objective: A number of analytical methods have been reported {{for the analysis of}} <b>sulfacetamide</b> but they lack the ability to determine both the active drug and its major degradation product, sulfanilamide, simultaneously in a sample. Materials and Methods: In the present study a simple, rapid and economical stability-indicating UV spectrometric method has been validated for the simultaneous assay of <b>sulfacetamide</b> sodium and sulfanilamide in pure form and in ophthalmic preparations. Results: The method {{has been found to be}} accurate (recovery 100. 03 Â± 0. 589 %) and precise (RSD 0. 587 %) with detectable and quantifiable limits of 1. 67 Ã— 10 â€“ 6 M (0. 04 mg%) and 5. 07 Ã— 10 â€“ 6 M (0. 13 mg%), respectively for the assay of pure <b>sulfacetamide</b> sodium. The method is also found to be accurate and precise to small changes in wavelength, pH and buffer concentration as well as to forced degradation. The study further includes the validation of the method for the assay of pure sulfanilamide in solution, which has been found to be accurate, precise and robust. Conclusion: The results indicate that the proposed two-component spectrometric method is stability-indicating and can be used for the simultaneous assay of both <b>sulfacetamide</b> sodium and sulfanilamide in synthetic mixtures and degraded solutions...|$|E

40|$|Background and Design: Clindamycin and {{erythromycin}} are {{the most}} widely used topical antibiotics in the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. The combination of topical antibiotics with benzoyl peroxide increases the efficacy of the treatment and reduces antibiotic resistance of Propionibacterium acnes. Sodium <b>sulfacetamide</b> is a sulfonamide antibiotic. Although it has been known for many years, it is not widely used in acne treatment. However, it has recently acquired currency again. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of sodium <b>sulfacetamide</b> in the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris and to compare with the other widely used topical antibiotics. Material and Method: In our comparative study, 60 patients with acne vulgaris were randomly assigned into 3 groups, wherein the 1 st, 2 nd, and 3 rd groups were applied sodium <b>sulfacetamide</b> 10 % lotion, clindamycin 1 % lotion, and erythromycin 2 % gel, respectively, twice daily for 12 weeks. Each group consisted of 20 subjects. The treatment was combined with benzoyl peroxide in all groups. The patients were assessed for noninflammatory (open and closed comedones) and inflammatory (papules and pustules) lesion counts at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and, adverse events were recorded. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups for age, sex and acne duration (p> 0. 05). Statistically significant decrease was obtained with all 3 treatment regimens at the end of the study (p 0. 05). Conclusion: In this study, topical sodium <b>sulfacetamide</b> was found to be as effective and safe as erythromycin and clindamycin when combined with benzoyl peroxide in the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. These results should be supported by studies with larger cohorts...|$|E
