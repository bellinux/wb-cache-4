40|$|Laminated {{paperboard}} {{is used as}} a {{packaging material}} {{for a wide range of}} products. During production of the packaging, the fold lines are first defined in a so-called creasing (or <b>scoring)</b> <b>operation</b> in order to obtain uncracked folds. During creasing as well as folding, cracking of the board is to be avoided. A mechanical model for a single fold line has been proposed in a previous study (Beex & Peerlings 2009 Int. J. Solids Struct. 46, 4192 - 4207) to investigate the general mechanics of creasing and folding, as well as which precise mechanisms trigger the breaking of the top layer. In the present study, we employ this modelling to study the influence of delamination on creasing and folding. The results reveal the separate role of the cohesive zone model and the friction model in the description of delamination. They also show how the amount of delamination behaviour should be controlled to obtain the desired high folding stiffness without breaking of the top layer...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} on a {{scoring method}} of list response question of which response {{is a list}} of elements, and the elements are completely ordered. List response questions include questions such as sequencing and application-operation type. Few papers focus attention on efficient scoring method when the correct answers are combinationally redundant, or on scoring method considering seriousness of mistakes. This paper deals with these problems in the case that the dissimilarity criterion is used for scoring. To realize an efficient scoring when plural correct answers exist, a method to construct a <b>scoring</b> <b>operation</b> graph from the correct answers and the examinee's answer, and to reduce it to solve the minimal cost problem is proposed. A heuristic function to solve the minimal cost problem using A* algorithm is also presented. When considering the seriousness of mistakes, deciding the degrees of penalty is an important problem. Here, we consider estimating the degrees from human scores, and decided them using regression model. A cooking task is taken for an example to verify the validity of our method...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} crisis and prior recession made a huge dent in many industries. Companies want a cheaper manufactured product with same quality to satisfy the customer in order be competitive yet profitable. Shatterprufe {{is a company that}} produces automotive glass. The company has a vast number of products and experience short production run lengths because of its order intake from customers. These short production run lengths require accurate setup to have a repeatable and stable process. An incorrect setup will produce a high scrap rate on production runs. Glass being very brittle and machining it incorrectly results in flaws, breakages or edge stresses that lead to latter process failures. The <b>scoring</b> <b>operation</b> of glass is key to achieve good edge quality to prevent such defects. The correct tools and machine parameters influence good edge quality during the setup procedure. Due to the process having many variables it is difficult to have a stable process and a repeatable stable process. This research will analyse the tool, parameters of the tool and machine parameters to achieve best edge quality and correlating these parameters that will lead to a repeatable stable process. An experimental analysis was conducted on 2. 1 mm and 2. 5 mm thick glass. These thicknesses are used predominantly at Shatterprufe automotive glass manufacturing company. The first sample and last sample was analysed during a production run. An average production run length is 36 pieces of glass. The edge quality was seen under a microscope and the fissure depth was measured. To achieve ideal edge quality, the fissure depth must be 15 - 20 % deep of the glass thickness. A fissure is a crack propagated during the scoring of glass. A carbide wheel is used to score the glass. The carbide wheel parameters were varied being the wheel angle and wheel diameter. A 145 degree- 4. 1 mm wheel, 145 degree- 5. 6 mm wheel and a 155 degree- 4. 1 mm wheel was used. The following relationships where observed being the wheel diameter and fissure depth. An increase in wheel diameter resulted in an increase in fissure depth but decreases the wheel life as the wheel becomes blunt. There was inconsistency on fissure depth with the larger diameter wheel. An increased in wheel angle from 145 degree to 155 degree promoted flaws in the glass. Larger wheel angles work better on glass thicknesses of 4 - 5 mm as currently used in the Shatterprufe Struandale Company. An investigation on pressure variation in the pneumatic system was analysed using a pressure transmitter. The pressure transmitter measured the pressure per second versus the set pressure and recorded this data on a data logger. There was no pressure variation in the pneumatic system that can influence poor glass edge quality. A load cell analysis will investigate the physical applied pressure on the glass versus the set pressure. This analysis was to determine the relationship between set versus actual on the glass. It will indicate any mechanical fault. A mechanical fault could be a loose coupling or linkage that can influence the fissure depth. A direct proportional relationship was achieved between the set pressure versus the load cell readings. This indicates no mechanical fault on the system...|$|E

40|$|Background. Although many {{surgical}} {{strategies have}} been used to reduce the anastomotic leak (AL) rate after laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery, limited data are available on the risk factors for AL and the effective strategy to reduce AL. Methods. The present study enrolled 736 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic resection without a diverting stoma for rectal adenocarcinoma. A nomogram was constructed to predict AL. Based on the nomogram, personalized risk was calculated and sequential surgical strategies were monitored using risk-adjusted cumulative sum (RA-CUSUM) analysis. Results. Among the 736 patients, clinical AL occurred in 65 patients (8. 8 %). Sex, an American Society of Anesthesiologists <b>score,</b> <b>operation</b> time, blood transfusion, and tumor location were identified as significant predictive factors for AL. Based on these factors, a nomogram was created to predict AL, with a concordance index (C-index) of 0. 753 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 690 – 0. 816). A calibration plot showed good statistical performance on internal validation (bias-corrected C-index of 0. 742). The RA-CUSUM curve showed that extended splenic flexure mobilization (SFM) could be the most influential strategy to reduce AL. Conclusions. Our nomogram for predicting AL after laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery might be helpful to identify the individual risk of AL.

However, clear clinical evidence is still lacking {{whether any of}} the procedures is superior to the others regarding morbidity and mortality in the early postoperative period. Two operative approaches for esophageal carcinoma, transhiatal and transthoracic, were compared with respect to operative morbidity, mortality and systemic inflammatory response. In our prospective study between 2000 and 2002 83 patients were investigated. In a retrospective post hoc analysis patients {{were divided into two}} groups due to the performed operational procedure, transhiatal (TH) or transthoracic (TT).

Methods: Eighty-six patients with femoral neck fractures were treated by closed reduction internal fixation with a DHS-BLADE (n =  42; 18 males and 24 females; mean age: 56. 3 years (37 – 87)) or cannulated compression screws (n =  44; 20 males and 24 females; mean age: 53. 8 years (26 – 83)) between March 2011 and August 2013. The groups were compared with Harris hip <b>score,</b> <b>operation</b> time, surgical blood loss, incision size, hospital stay, and related complications. Results: The average follow-up time was 27 months (range, 24 – 36 months). There was no significant difference for the operation time, incision size, hospital stay, and Harris hip score between the groups. Also, no statistically significant differences in the rates of nonunion (4. 5 % vs. 0) and avascular necrosis of the femoral head (9. 1 % vs. 7. 1 %) were observed. However, the screw group experienced significantly less surgical blood loss (32. 4  ±  24. 7  ml) than the blade group (87. 2  ±  46. 6  ml; P =  0. 041). The incidence of femoral neck shortening above 10  mm in the screw group was significantly higher than that in the blade group (15. 9 % vs. 2. 4 %, P =  0. 031). The blade group had a significantly lower incidence of screw migration than the screw group (4. 8 % vs. 22. 7 %, P =  0. 016). Conclusion: The DHS-BLADE and cannulated compression screws might be equally effective in terms of postoperative fracture union. However, the DHS-BLADE has advantages over cannulated compression screws for preventing femoral neck shortening, screw migration, and cut-out. Level of evidence: Level III, Therapeutic study...|$|R

The goal of this study was to update the Cochrane review on the effect of surgical techniques for sciatica due to disc herniation, which was last updated in 2007. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In April 2011, we conducted a comprehensive search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDRO, ICL, and trial registries. We also checked the reference lists and citation tracking results of each retrieved article. Only randomized controlled trials (RCT) of the surgical management of sciatica due to disc herniation were included. Comparisons including chemonucleolysis and prevention of scar tissue or comparisons against conservative treatment were excluded. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias of the studies and extracted data. Quality of evidence was graded according to the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Seven studies from the original Cochrane review were included and nine additional studies were found. In total, 16 studies were included, of which four had a low risk of bias. Studies showed that microscopic discectomy results in a significantly, but not clinically relevant longer operation time of 12 min (95 % CI 2 - 22) and shorter incision of 24 mm (95 % CI 7 - 40) compared with open discectomy, but did not find any clinically relevant superiority of either technique on clinical results. There were conflicting results regarding the comparison of tubular discectomy versus microscopic discectomy for back pain and surgical duration. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the limited amount and quality of evidence, no firm conclusions on effectiveness of the current surgical techniques being open discectomy, microscopic discectomy, and tubular discectomy compared with each other can be drawn. Those differences in leg or back pain <b>scores,</b> <b>operation</b> time, and incision length that were found are clinically insignificant.
