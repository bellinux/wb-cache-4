40|$|Background and Aims: Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is an {{aggressive}} fungal disease {{that involves the}} nose, par nasal sinuses, orbit and central nervous system. It may rapidly be fatal. The major route of infection is inhalation. This infection usually occurs secondary to immune suppression, diabetic ketoacidosis, and prolonged use of antibiotics, steroids, etc. Case report: We presented two cases of rhino cerebral mucormycosis with same presentation. Both patients had underlying disease (diabetes or immune deficiency). The symptoms began including colds and sinusitis and was accompanied by pain and <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> <b>face.</b> Smear of necrotic tissue showed branching nonseptated mycelium in favor of mucosal. These patients were treated Included Medical therapy with amphotericin-B and surgical treatment was undertaken to drain the sinuses. Conclusions: The diagnosis of rhino cerebral mucormycosis {{should be considered in}} the hospital in diabetic patients. Early diagnosis and treatment, treatment of the underlying disease are crucial factors leading to a good outcome. *Corresponding author: Graduate of Nursing, Faculty Member of Neyshabur University of Medical Sciences, Khorasan razavi, Iran.

Half of all patients with Sjogren’s syndrome experience arthritis during the disease course. We here describe the first case of Sjogren’s syndrome presenting as RS 3 PE. She had swelling in knees, ankles, and wrists. After then the swelling spread to her lower legs, feet, face, and both hands. She was admitted to another hospital and was suspected of lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. Three months later, she had dry mouth and had lower lip biopsy. She was admitted to this hospital due to development of <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> <b>face</b> and lower legs for 3 days. On physical examination, she had pitting edema in both hands and feet dorsum. Laboratory test showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, positivity of rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-Ro antibody. There was no erosion in the hands radiography. Schirmer’s test and lip biopsy was com-patible with Sjogren’s syndrome. She was diagnosed RS 3 PE and Sjogren’s syndrome. She was begun with prednisolone and her symptoms improved gradually...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A 41 -year-old {{woman had}} {{two months of}} {{intermittent}} migratory <b>swellings</b> <b>in</b> the trunk, <b>face,</b> and limbs associated with erythema, pruritus, and pain. Laboratory analysis showed moderate eosinophilia. The triad of eosino-philia, migratory lesions (nodular panniculitis), and raw fish consumption was highly suggestive of cutaneous gnathostomiasis. She was successfully treated with albendazole (400 mg twice a day for 21 days) and showed complete and permanent resolution of the lesions. A 41 -year-old woman had two months of intermittent migratory <b>swellings</b> <b>in</b> the trunk, <b>face,</b> and limbs associated with erythema, pruritus, and pain. The skin lesions were recurrent, typically lasting 1 – 2 weeks before spontaneous res-olution. She denied fever, chills, or other clinical signs. She reported regular consumption of undercooked raw fish and shellfish. Physical examination showed palpable, non-pitting <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> the right arm (Figure 1) and left leg, this leg showed subcutaneous hemorrhage (Figure 2). Laboratory analysis showed moderate eosinophilia (960 cells/mm 3). The triad of eosinophilia, migratory lesions (nodular panniculitis), and raw fish consumption was highly suggestive of cutane-ous gnathostomiasis. Two weeks before arrival, she received a single dose of ivermectin (200 mg/kg) and showed no resolution. She was given albendazole (400 mg twice a day for 21 days) and showed complete and permanent resolution of the lesions.

40|$|Reports {{of allergy}} to kiwifruit have become {{increasingly}} common over the past 30 years and severe reactions occur quite frequently, especially among children. Also known as the Chinese gooseberry, the kiwifruit started to be grown commercially in New Zealand in the 1930 s but it wasn’t until the late 1960 s that it {{became part of the}} UK diet. Reports of kiwifruit allergy in the UK started to become common in the 1980 s, mainly among adults, and then among children in the 1990 s. This factsheet aims to answer some of the questions which you and your family might have about living with kiwifruit allergy. Our aim is to provide information that will help you to avoid kiwifruit, minimise risks and know how to treat an allergic reaction should it occur. If you know or suspect you are allergic to kiwifruit, the most important message is to visit your GP and seek a referral to an allergy specialist – even if your symptoms have so far been mild. Throughout the text you will see brief medical references given in brackets. More complete references are published towards the end of this fact sheet. Symptoms of kiwifruit allergy There are two types of kiwifruit allergy. 1. Some people become allergic after contact with the kiwifruit itself (for example, eating the fruit). In these cases, mild symptoms may include nettle rash anywhere on the body, or a tingling or itchy feeling in the mouth. More serious symptoms include: <b>Swelling</b> <b>in</b> the <b>face,</b> throat and/or mout...|$|R

40|$|Egg is {{a common}} cause of {{allergic}} reactions in infants and young children. It often begins in the child’s {{first year of life}} and in some cases lasts into the teenage years – or even into adulthood for a few people. Children who develop allergy to foods such as egg often have other allergic conditions. Eczema and food allergy often occur in early infancy and later on there may be hay-fever, asthma or both. This factsheet aims to answer some of the questions which you and your family may have about living with egg allergy. Our aim is to provide information that will help you to understand and minimise risks. Even severe cases can be well managed with the right guidance. Many cases of egg allergy are mild, but more severe symptoms are a possibility for some people. If you believe you or your child is allergic to egg, the most important message is to visit your GP and ask for allergy tests and expert advice on management. Throughout this fact sheet you will see brief medical references given in brackets. Full references are provided at the end. Symptoms triggered by egg The symptoms of a food allergy, including egg allergy, may occur within seconds or minutes of coming into contact with the culprit food. On occasions there may be a delay of more than an hour. Mild symptoms include nettle rash (otherwise known as hives or urticaria) or a tingling or itchy feeling in the mouth. More serious symptoms are uncommon but remain a possibility for some people, including children. These may include: <b>Swelling</b> <b>in</b> the <b>face,</b> throat and/or mouth Difficulty breathing Severe asthma Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting In a few extreme cases there could be a dramatic fall in blood pressure (anaphylactic shock).

40|$|The lupin is {{well-known}} {{as a popular}} garden flower with its tall, colourful spikes. The seeds from some varieties of lupin are also cultivated as food. These can either be eaten whole or else crushed to make lupin flour, {{which can be used}} in baked goods such as pastries, pies, pancakes and in pasta. Allergy to lupin has been recognised for some time in mainland Europe, where lupin flour is used fairly commonly in food products. In the UK, cases of lupin allergy are less common because lupin is only rarely used in foods. If its use were to increase, we believe the number of cases would rise. This factsheet aims to answer some of the questions that you and your family might have about lupin allergy. Our aim is to provide information that will help those affected to understand their allergy and minimise risks. The text also contains information for people with peanut allergy who are seeking to understand the link between peanut and lupin. As we explain, both foods are in the same botanical group (known as legumes) and research suggests that some people with peanut allergy are also allergic to lupin. If you know or think you are allergic to lupin, the most important message is to visit your GP and ask for a referral to an allergy specialist. Throughout the text you will see brief medical references given in brackets. More complete references are published towards the end. Symptoms triggered by lupin The symptoms of a food allergy, including lupin allergy, may come on rapidly. Mild symptoms may include nettle rash (otherwise known as hives or urticaria) anywhere on the body, or a tingling or itchy feeling in the mouth.
