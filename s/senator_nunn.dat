500|$|In October 1985, the Senate Armed Services Committee {{published}} {{the results of}} its two-year review of the U.S. military structure, entitled [...] "Defense Organization: The Need For Change." [...] Mr. James R. Locher III, the principal author of this study, also examined past special operations and speculated on the most likely future threats. This influential document led to the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986. By spring 1986, SOF advocates had introduced reform bills {{in both houses of}} Congress. On 15 May, Senator Cohen introduced the Senate bill, co-sponsored by <b>Senator</b> <b>Nunn</b> and others, which called for a joint military organization for SOF and the establishment of an office in the Defense Department to ensure adequate funding and policy emphasis for low-intensity conflict and special operations. Representative Daniel's proposal went even further—he wanted a national special operations agency headed by a civilian who would bypass the Joint Chiefs and report directly to the Secretary of Defense; this would keep Joint Chiefs and the Services out of the SOF budget process.|$|E
50|$|When announcing <b>Senator</b> <b>Nunn</b> as the {{recipient}} of the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage, Georgia Institute of Technology President Peterson stated, “While some individuals talk about achieving world peace, Sam Nunn has actively pursued this vision and created a legacy that continues to reap results long after his exit from public office.” Peterson lauded Nunn for courage and commitment to his own moral compass, for standing up for his beliefs, and for enacting meaningful and sustainable solutions for making the world a better, and more peaceful place.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, Nunn co-authored the Nunn-Lugar Act, {{which set}} up the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program that is {{credited}} with aiding former Soviet republics in ridding their territories of nuclear weapons. As of June 2014, the program had contributed to the deactivation of more than 7,600 nuclear warheads, neutralized chemical weapons, safeguarded fissile material, converted weapons facilities for peaceful use, mitigated bio-threats, and redirected the work of former weapons scientists and engineers. <b>Senator</b> <b>Nunn</b> is co-chairman and CEO of the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that focuses on reducing global threats from weapons of mass destruction.|$|E

Nunn served from 1979 to 1980 and again from 1987 to 1995, while Roth served from 1981 to 1986, and again from 1995 to 1996. Senator Roth led {{a wide range}} of investigations into commodity investment fraud, off-shore banking schemes, money laundering, and child pornography. <b>Senator</b> <b>Nunn</b> inquired into federal drug policy, the global spread of chemical and biological weapons, abuses in Federal Student Aid programs, computer security, aviation safety, and health care fraud.|$|E

5000|$|Others {{feel that}} {{changing}} conditions since {{enactment of the}} legislation require DOPMA reform.While the promotion system is predictable, it allows the services little flexibility to reward and manage its top performers. According to author and economist Tim Kane, DOPMA is [...] "the root of all evil in this ecosystem," [...] and binds the military into a system that honors seniority over individual merit. Kane argues that the resultant inflexibility causes tremendous attrition in the officer corps since officers have little control over their careers, but has persisted despite numerous efforts towards reform. Perhaps the most controversial provision is the [...] "up or out" [...] policy. Even the sponsor of the bill, <b>Senator</b> <b>Nunn,</b> {{argued that it was}} needlessly expensive to force officers through the ranks and rid others unnecessarily. However, the Department of Defense and the House insisted these provisions were included. Other changes to DOPMA that have been recommended to Congress include adoption of an [...] "up or stay" [...] personnel policy, greater use of warrant officers, and decreasing the number of officer skills managed in the [...] "line" [...] category.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, NIS was {{responsible}} for investigating the Tailhook scandal, which involved allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment by Naval and Marine Corps officers in Las Vegas, Nevada. Subsequent to this investigation, and {{at the direction of}} the chairman of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Sam Nunn, the Naval Investigative Service was restructured into the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). The restructuring occurred as a result of perceived lapses in proper investigative technique over the Tailhook scandal, as well as chain of command issues and a lack of civilian oversight in previous investigations. At the time, <b>Senator</b> <b>Nunn</b> stated, [...] "The Navy's whole investigative technique should be under serious question." [...] As a result of the investigation into the Tailhook scandal, the Pentagon's inspector general was sharply critical of NIS leadership, stating that there was a top-down culture showing a lack of cooperation with other authorities in the Navy. [...] By 1992, Acting Secretary of the Navy, Sean O'Keefe, recommended the word [...] "Criminal" [...] be included in NIS's name in order to make clear their investigative function. Ultimately, NIS commander, Rear Adm. Duvall Williams Jr., was forced to retire and NIS was reorganized as NCIS under civilian leadership.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, a few on Capitol Hill were {{determined}} to overhaul United States Special Operations Forces. They included <b>Senators</b> Sam <b>Nunn</b> (D-GA) and William Cohen (R-ME), both members of the Armed Services Committee, and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), {{the chairman of the}} United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem. <b>Senators</b> <b>Nunn</b> and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|R
