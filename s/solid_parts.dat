500|$|At {{pressures}} above approximately 10 GPa {{and temperatures}} {{of a few}} hundred kelvin or less, α-iron changes into a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure, which is also known as ε-iron; the higher-temperature γ-phase also changes into ε-iron, but does so at higher pressure. The β-phase, if it exists, would appear at pressures of at least 50 GPa and temperatures of at least 1500 K and have an orthorhombic or a double hcp structure. These high-pressure phases of iron are important as endmember models for the <b>solid</b> <b>parts</b> of planetary cores. The inner core of the Earth is generally presumed to be an iron-nickel alloy with ε (or β) structure. Somewhat confusingly, the term [...] "β-iron" [...] is sometimes also used to refer to α-iron above its Curie point, when it changes from being ferromagnetic to paramagnetic, even though its crystal structure has not changed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{viscoelastic}} {{behavior of}} model sandy soils {{in the form}} of silica particle compacts under dynamic compression (0. 2 – 10. 0 Hz) is reported. The solid content ranges from 24 to 28 % by volume, as controlled by compaction. Both viscous and elastic characters are largely governed by the <b>solid</b> <b>part</b> of the compact. The elastic character stems from the stiffness of the silica, while the viscous character stems from the interparticle movement. The elastic character of the <b>solid</b> <b>part</b> (the storage modulus and solid content) is essentially independent of the degree of compaction, indicating validity of the rule of mixtures. The viscous character of the <b>solid</b> <b>part</b> (the loss tangent and solid content) decreases with increasing degree of compaction, indicating decreasing ease of interparticle movement as the degree of compaction increases. The loss modulus and solid content is essentially independent of the degree of compaction. All quantities decrease with increasing frequency. A low degree of compaction is recommended for fast decay of the vibration amplitude; no particular degree of compaction is recommended for mechanical energy dissipation.

60|$|The Magnet acts upon Iron {{through all}} dense Bodies not magnetick nor red hot, without any {{diminution}} of its Virtue; as for instance, through Gold, Silver, Lead, Glass, Water. The gravitating Power of the Sun is transmitted through the vast Bodies of the Planets without any diminution, {{so as to}} act upon all their parts to their very centers with the same Force {{and according to the}} same Laws, as if the part upon which it acts were not surrounded with the Body of the Planet, The Rays of Light, whether they be very small Bodies projected, or only Motion or Force propagated, are moved in right Lines; and whenever a Ray of Light is by any Obstacle turned out of its rectilinear way, it will never return into the same rectilinear way, unless perhaps by very great accident. And yet Light is transmitted through pellucid solid Bodies in right Lines to very great distances. How Bodies can have a sufficient quantity of Pores for producing these Effects is very difficult to conceive, but perhaps not altogether impossible. For the Colours of Bodies arise from the Magnitudes of the Particles which reflect them, as was explained above. Now if we conceive these Particles of Bodies to be so disposed amongst themselves, that the Intervals or empty Spaces between them may be equal in magnitude to them all; and that these Particles may be composed of other Particles much smaller, which have as much empty Space between them as equals all the Magnitudes of these smaller Particles: And that in like manner these smaller Particles are again composed of others much smaller, all which together are equal to all the Pores or empty Spaces between them; and so on perpetually till you come to solid Particles, such as have no Pores or empty Spaces within them: And if in any gross Body there be, for instance, three such degrees of Particles, the least of which are solid; this Body will have seven times more Pores than <b>solid</b> <b>Parts.</b> But if there be four such degrees of Particles, the least of which are solid, the Body will have fifteen times more Pores than <b>solid</b> <b>Parts.</b> If there be five degrees, the Body will have one and thirty times more Pores than <b>solid</b> <b>Parts.</b> If six degrees, the Body will have sixty and three times more Pores than <b>solid</b> <b>Parts.</b> And so on perpetually. And there are other ways of conceiving how Bodies may be exceeding porous. But what is really their inward Frame is not yet known to us.|$|E

60|$|But, in truth, the {{pressure}} of any ambient fluid, how great soever, can be no intelligible cause of the cohesion of the <b>solid</b> <b>parts</b> of matter. For, though such a pressure may hinder the avulsion of two polished superficies, one from another, in a line perpendicular to them, as in the experiment of two polished marbles; yet it can never in the least hinder the separation by a motion, in a line parallel to those surfaces. Because the ambient fluid, having a full liberty to succeed in each point of space, deserted by a lateral motion, resists such a motion of bodies, so joined, no more than it would resist the motion of that body were it on all sides environed by that fluid, and touched no other body; and therefore, {{if there were no}} other cause of cohesion, all parts of bodies must be easily separable by such a lateral sliding motion. For if {{the pressure}} of the aether be the adequate cause of cohesion, wherever that cause operates not, there can be no cohesion. And since it cannot operate against a lateral separation, (as has been shown,) therefore in every imaginary plane, intersecting any mass of matter, there could be no more cohesion than of two polished surfaces, which will always, notwithstanding any imaginable pressure of a fluid, easily slide one from another. So that perhaps, how clear an idea soever we think we have of the extension of body, which is nothing but the cohesion of <b>solid</b> <b>parts,</b> he that shall well consider it in his mind, may have reason to conclude, That it is as easy for him to have a clear idea how the soul thinks as how body is extended. For, since body is no further, nor otherwise, extended, than by the union and cohesion of its <b>solid</b> <b>parts,</b> we shall very ill comprehend the extension of body, without understanding wherein consists the union and cohesion of its parts; which seems to me as incomprehensible as the manner of thinking, and how it is performed.|$|E

60|$|To conclude: {{whatever}} men shall think {{concerning the}} existence of a VACUUM, this is plain to me--that we have as clear an idea of space distinct from solidity, as we have of solidity distinct from motion, or motion from space. We have not any two more distinct ideas; and we can as easily conceive space without solidity, as we can conceive body or space without motion, though it be never so certain that neither body nor motion can exist without space. But whether any one will take space to be only a RELATION resulting from {{the existence of}} other beings at a distance; or whether they will think the words of the most knowing King Solomon, 'The heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee;' or those more emphatical ones of the inspired philosopher St. Paul, 'In him we live, move, and have our being,' are to be understood in a literal sense, I leave every one to consider: only our idea of space is, I think, such as I have mentioned, and distinct from that of body. For, whether we consider, in matter itself, the distance of its coherent <b>solid</b> <b>parts,</b> and call it, in respect of those <b>solid</b> <b>parts,</b> extension; or whether, considering it as lying between the extremities of any body in its several dimensions, we call it length, breadth, and thickness; or else, considering it as lying between any two bodies or positive beings, without any consideration whether there be any matter or not between, we call it distance;--however named or considered, it is always the same uniform simple idea of space, taken from objects about which our senses have been conversant; whereof, having settled ideas in our minds, we can revive, repeat, and add them one to another as often as we will, and consider the space or distance so imagined, either as filled with <b>solid</b> <b>parts,</b> so that another body cannot come there without displacing and thrusting out the body that was there before; or else as void of solidity, so that a body of equal dimensions to that empty or pure space may be placed in it, without the removing or expulsion of anything that was, there.|$|E

60|$|For a {{very long}} time that was a great matter of dispute. The early French observers, to do them justice, discerned the real state of the case, namely, that there was a very close {{connection}} between the actual life of the yeast plant and this operation of the splitting up of the sugar; and that one was in some way or other connected with the other. All investigation subsequently has confirmed this original idea. It has been shown that if you take any measures by which other plants of like kind to the torula would be killed, and by which the yeast plant is killed, then the yeast loses its efficiency. But a capital experiment upon this subject was made by a very distinguished man, Helmholz, who performed an experiment of this kind. He had two vessels--one of them we will suppose full of yeast, but over the bottom of it, as this might be, was tied a thin film of bladder; consequently, through that thin film of bladder all the liquid parts of the yeast would go, but the <b>solid</b> <b>parts</b> would be stopped behind; the torula would be stopped, the liquid parts of the yeast would go. And then he took another vessel containing a fermentable solution of sugar, and he put one inside the other; and in this way you see the fluid parts of the yeast were able to pass through with the utmost ease into the sugar, but the <b>solid</b> <b>parts</b> could not get through at all. And he judged thus: if the fluid parts are those which excite fermentation, then, inasmuch as these are stopped, the sugar will not ferment; and the sugar did not ferment, showing quite clearly, that an immediate contact with the solid, living torula was absolutely necessary to excite this process of splitting up of the sugar. This experiment was quite conclusive as to this particular point, and has had very great fruits in other directions.|$|E
