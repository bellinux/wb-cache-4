40|$|Power <b>system</b> <b>stabilisers</b> using {{fuzzy logic}} and neural {{networks}} This thesis investigates {{the use of}} fuzzy logic and neural networks {{in the design of}} power <b>system</b> <b>stabilisers.</b> Power <b>system</b> <b>stabilisers</b> are used to enhance the damping of low frequency oscillations in the shaft speed of the generators used in a power system. The most widely used power <b>system</b> <b>stabiliser</b> is a lead-lag compensator known as a conventional power <b>system</b> <b>stabiliser.</b> The design of conventional power <b>system</b> <b>stabilisers</b> is based on linearised model of the power system for a specific operating point.

Initially, key components for the electrical control system components were duplicated; however, {{in order to make}} the detection of faults infallible, a safer partial-triplex arrangement was adopted for the RAE's free flight testing phase.

Power System Stabilizers are often used as effective and economic means for damping the generator's electromechanical oscillations and enhance the overall stability of power systems.

50|$|The T-54 and T-55 tanks {{received}} full gun stabilisation in 1956 {{with the}} STP-2 Tsyklon <b>stabiliser</b> <b>system</b> (from D-10 tank gun). The STP-2 stabilised the main gun in both {{horizontal and vertical}} planes. However {{the lack of a}} ballistic computer still remained an issue. The tank was not accurate firing if moving left or right respectively to the target, because even though the gun was stabilised, it couldn't keep a lock on the target, the shell fired from such a platform would keep on moving sideways as fast as the tank moved sideways off the target. For example, if the T-54/55 was moving at 40 km/h speed with the stabilised gun aimed at the target at a 1000 meter range, moving sideways (the hull facing the target with its side), the shell fired by the T-54/55 would fly approximately 1.5 meters off to the side from the point of aiming. Same drawback also applies for vertical movement. If the T-54/55 was moving down hill at considerable speed, with the gun aimed at the target, the fired shell would fall lower than the point it was aimed at. The gunner had to be careful to figure out where to aim the stabilised gun around the target to avoid such overshooting. That's one of the particular reasons why a well-trained gunner was a very useful asset in a T-54 and T-55 tank. Nevertheless, the tank could fire accurately despite the lack of ballistic computers if the tank was moving at lower speed, or if heading straight towards its target. Also, additional markings to either sides of the main aiming chevron on the TSh2B-32 sight could help the gunner to aim more precisely on the move.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the rheological effects observed after addition of (natural) polyols to several {{different types of}} heavy metal-free PVC formulations. It is found that addition of natural polyols, such as sorbitol, leads {{to changes in the}} rheology of the system comparable to the addition of external lubricants. Hence as suggested previously, addition of (natural) polyols may lead to the occurrence of undesirable plate-out phenomena. The magnitude of the effect on the rheology depends on the number of hydroxyl groups in the polyol and its propensity to undergo intramolecular cyclodehydration reactions. It is established that the undesirable rheological effects, which coincide with plate-out phenomena, can be suppressed by the addition of various types of inorganic as well as organic substances, most of which are known PVC additives.

40|$|Plastic crates will {{deteriorate}} {{and ultimately}} fail due to brittle fracture if, either during use or storage, {{they are exposed}} to sunlight. The time to failure depends on the UV stability of the polymer used, but in particular also on the conditions of use, such as time of exposure, height of the stack during stocking, rate of circulation and manner of transportation. Because of differences in the conditions of use, the time to failure of creates of the same batch will be different. The decrease of the size of a particular batch in time can be described by a Weibull-function, an empirical, statistical function. Knowledge of this function for a batch provides the possibility to predict reliably the number of crates to be rejected in forthcoming years. The UV stability of recycled, degraded high density polyethylene (HDPE) create material appears to be hardly dependent on the degree of degradation, although it is lower than the UV stability of the type of HDPE originally used for production of the creates. The UV stability can, however, be markedly enhanced by the addition of a proper <b>stabiliser</b> <b>system.</b> The tensile impact strength and the meltindex of recycled HDPE depend also hardly on the degree of degradation and are, in general, sufficient for crate material. It is concluded that recycling of degraded crates, even of embrittled crates, and reuse of the material for the production of new crates, is worthwile to be considered.

40|$|A study {{into the}} {{degradation}} of crystalline Hydrazinium Nitroformate (HNF) in isolation {{has been carried out}} alongside studies into HNF / polyNIMMO propellant degradation. The contribution of gas / solid autocatalysis in {{the degradation of}} the crystalline phase has been determined to be very low. Studies via GC-MS analysis do suggest that the presence (and eventual release) of the crystal impurity, isopropyl alcohol, is a more significant contributor to the eventual autocatalytic breakdown of the crystal matrix. Investigations into the chemical compatibility of HNF with nitrosated and nitrated derivatives of 2 NDPA and pNMA indicated that the reaction of HNF is most rapid with N-NO- 2 NDPA. This reaction between HNF and N-NO- 2 NDPA is proposed to be the principal route to rapid propellant degradation in 2 NDPA stabilised propellant systems. Analysis of a range of polyNIMMO / HNF propellants has allowed development of a hypothesis for this family of propellant compositions over a range of temperatures. The data has indicated that the degradation of polyNIMMO / HNF propellants is a complex process involving a number of interrelated and interdependent reactions. It appears that a significantly different reaction scheme dominates at 80 °C compared to either 60 °C or 40 °C.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{processing}} on the antioxidant activity of sulphur-containing compounds, with particular reference to nickel dialkyldithiophosphates and their corresponding di sulphides, were studied in polyolefins under melt, thermal and photo-oxidative conditions. These compounds were evaluated both at low (normal) and high (concentrates) concentrations. In general, the dithiophosphates {{were found to}} be very efficient melt stabilisers at normal concentrtion levels, and compare quite favourably with the best commercially available systems. The nickel dithiophosphates were also found to be very efficient thermal stabilisers for polyolefins, but their activity is highly dependent on the alkyl substituent in the molecule. The corresponding disulphides on the other hand showed very little activity under thermal oxidative conditions, and this was attributed to their inefficiency in scavenging alkyl peroxyl radicals since both compounds possess similar peroxidolytic activity. Furthermore, the nickel dithiophosphates {{were found to be}} excellent photo stabilisers for mildly-processed polyolefins while the corresponding disulphides only offer slight protection to the polymer. Oxidative processing of the disulphide, however, results in a dramatic improvement in their photo antioxidant activity. Thionophospho-ric acid, a major oxidation product of dithiophosphates, was also shown to have photo antioxidant activity {{similar to that of the}} disulphides. A combination of a U. V. absorber with the nickel complex and/or the disulphide resulted in a synergistic <b>stabiliser</b> <b>system</b> which was further augmented by oxidative processing. Moreover, the dilute analogues of such multicomponent stabiliser concentrates also showed excellent melt, thermal and photo-stabilising activity. The mechanistic studies carried out on the nickel complex and the corresponding disulphide clearly identified the thionophosphoric acid a a major transformation product although various triesters were formed as reaction intermediates. The mechanisms of the antioxidant action of the dithiophosphates, which is believed to involve a cyclical process similar to that shown for simple alkyl sulphides and nitroxyls, are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of a fuzzy-logic power <b>system</b> <b>stabiliser</b> (FPSS), which is tuned automatically as the operating conditions of the power system change, is investigated by applying it to a multimachine power system.

40|$|Isocyanate {{cross-linked}} hydroxy terminated polybutadiene {{is used as}} {{a binder}} for solid rocket propellant. Rocket motors containing this propellant require a storage life of at least 20 years. During storage it has been found that the important rubbery properties of the binder can be lost due to oxidative cross-linking of the polybutadiene chains. This could cause catastrophic failure when the rocket motor is required. At present the bis-hindered phenol Calco 2246 {{is used as a}} thermal oxidative stabiliser, but it's performance is only adequate. This has led to the search for a more efficient <b>stabiliser</b> <b>system.</b> To hasten the evaluation of new antioxidant systems the use of dynamic thermal analysis was investigated. Results showed that a tentative relationship existed between predictions by thermal analysis and the long term oven ageing for simple single antioxidant systems. But for more complex systems containing either autosynergistic or mixed antioxidants no relationship was observed suggesting that results for such an "accelerated" technique cannot be used for the purpose of extrapolation for long term performance. This was attributed to the short time and more aggressive condition used (hjgher temperature and oxygen rich atmosphere in thermal analysis) altering the mechanism of action of the antioxidants and not allowing time for co-operative effect of the combined antioxidant system to form. One potential problem for the binder system is the use of an diisocyanate as a cross-linking agent. This reacts with the hydroxyl hydrogen on the polymer as well as other active hydrogens such as those contained in a number of antioxidants, affecting both cross-linking and antioxidant effectiveness. Studies in this work showed that only antioxidants containing amine moieties have a significant affect on binder preparation, with the phenolic antioxidants not reacting. This is due to the greater nucleophilicity of the amines. Investigation of a range of antioxidant systems, including potentially homo, hetero and autosynergistic systems, has highlighted a number of systems which show considerably greater effectiveness than the currently used antioxidant Calco 2246. The only single antioxidant which showed improvement was the partially unhindered phenol y-Tocopherol. Of the mixed systems combinations of the sulphur containing antioxidants e. g. DLTP with higher levels of chain-breaking antioxidants, especially Calco 2246, were the most promising. Also the homosynergistic mix of an aromatic amine and a phenol was seen to be very effective but the results were inconsistent. This inconsistency could be explained by the method of sample preparation used. It was shown that the efficiency of a number of antioxidant. s could be dramatically improved by the use of ultrasound during the mixing stage of preparation. The reason for this increase in performance is unclear {{but in the case of}} the homosynergistic amine/phenol mix both more efficient mixing and/or the production of a novel mechanism of action are suggeste...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken into {{the stability of}} the natural colour, from anthocyanins, and cloud in a Wildberry Herbal fruit drink. The fruit drinks consisted of cloudy apple and berry fruit juice with natural herb extracts and flavours. The objectives of the research were to identify the cause of cloud instability and sediment formation in the drink; determine the effect of ascorbic acid, berryfruit juice volume, storage temperature and light on anthocyanin stability; investigate the use of stabilisers to prevent sediment formation and determine consumer acceptability of a modified drink. The cause of sediment formation was determined by analysing the contribution of the major ingredients to the total amount of sediment formed. To minimise the sediment, a range of commercially available polysaccharide stabilisers were added to the drink and the amount of sediment formed determined. A consumer sensory evaluation was undertaken to determine consumer acceptability of drinks in which stabilisers had been added to improve the cloud stability. The factors affecting the anthocyanin's in the drink were analysed using a fractional factorial experimental design. The effect of the commercial pasteurisation process on the colour was also investigated. The formation of sediment was identified as being the result of complexing between the unstable cloud of the cloudy apple juice and polyphenolics, including anthocyanins, in the berryfruit juice. No sediment formed during eight weeks storage when clarified apple juice was substituted for cloudy apple juice. The sediment was reduced by approximately 45 % using <b>stabiliser</b> <b>systems</b> consisting of either xanthan or a xanthan/propylene glycol alginate mixture.
