40|$|Rotary <b>swaging</b> is an {{incremental}} bulk metal forming {{process for the}} manufacture of cylindrical lightweight components. Whilst conventional rotary <b>swaging</b> is still carried under the intense use of lubricants to provide desired work piece quality and to avoid forming die wear, recent scientific work focuses {{on the design of}} a dry process layout. Novel functionalized rotary <b>swaging</b> dies were introduced, exhibiting both diamond like carbon (DLC) hard coated and structured surfaces to encounter complex and opposing tribological requirements when dry machining. Such dies were successfully applied to infeed rotary <b>swaging</b> experiments machining steel 1. 0038 and aluminum 3. 3206 tubes. Although primary targets were achieved, the dry rotary <b>swaging</b> process is subject to an increased abrasive particle generation from the work piece material and accumulation of such particles in the forming zone. Abrasive particles provoke a loss of work piece quality and ultimately lead to a clogging of the <b>swaging</b> unit, associated with a significant earlier termination of the forming process. This work presents the investigation of the particle generation when dry rotary <b>swaging</b> with functionalized forming dies in dependence on the work piece material and the process parameter feed velocity. Subsequently, improvements of the die s design are discussed which are to reduce the generation of abrasive particles and conveying the particles from the <b>swaging</b> unit, indispensable for the robust layout of dry rotary <b>swaging</b> processes...|$|R
25|$|As swaging is a {{technique}} in which cold metal is formed over a grooved tool or <b>swage,</b> the term was adopted {{in the field of}} automotive styling to describe when two panels were brought together, an edge of one panel was swaged so to overlap the other to create the impression of one continuous surface.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{who make}} their own bullets usually {{are not aware of}} {{available}} manual specialized equipment and dies required for swaging bullets, and thus choose to make cast bullets. To get high precision results, it is common to cast the bullets slightly oversized, then <b>swage</b> the resulting castings through a die to do the final forming. Since the amount of pressure required to size the bullet is far less than that required to form a bullet, a simple mechanical press can be used, often the same press used for handloading ammunition.|$|E
25|$|Handloaders {{have the}} choice to <b>swage</b> but most choose to {{purchase}} pre-made jacketed bullets, due to the obscure nature of swaging and the specialized, expensive equipment. The process of manufacturing a jacketed bullet is far more complex than for a cast bullet; first, the jacket must be punched from a metal sheet of precise thickness, filled with a premeasured lead core, and then swaged into shape with a high pressure press in multiple steps. This involved process makes jacketed bullets far more expensive on average than cast bullets. Further complicating this are the requirements for controlled expansion bullets (see terminal ballistics), which require a tight bond between the jacket and the core. Premium expanding bullets are, with match grade bullets, at the top tier in expense.|$|E

40|$|A {{finite element}} {{analysis}} was performed to predict behaviour of sintered tungsten-based heavy alloy during cold rotary <b>swaging,</b> while experimental investigations evaluated mechanical and structure properties in both, sintered and <b>swaged</b> material states. The simulation involved prediction of <b>swaging</b> force, which was subsequently compared with force measured experimentally using own designed force detection system, although other parameters, such as strain, strain rate, stress and temperature were also predicted and subsequently compared to experimental data. The results showed significant hardening and strengthening after swaging; the average ultimate strengths after sintering and <b>swaging,</b> respectively, were 860 MPa and 1680 MPa. This also contributed to very high <b>swaging</b> force of almost 600 kN. The distribution of microhardness across the cross-section confirmed the predicted strain distribution. Texture analyses revealed a notion of cube texture given primarily by the fcc matrix in the sintered state, while several ideal orientations for both the fcc and bcc phases were observed after <b>swaging.</b> As indicated by grains misorientations analyses, <b>swaging</b> introduced residual stress, the distribution of which was in conformity with the predicted stress and strain distributions.

25|$|On modern yachts, {{standing}} rigging is often {{stainless steel wire}}, stainless steel rod or synthetic fiber.

Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strains (normally 19) break often near a <b>swage</b> fitting, and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts but it is difficult to see stress as this requires x-raying. Great care must be used when swaging fittings onto stainless steel rod as this can start minute cracking. Rod-type stays fail suddenly, often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The rotary <b>swaging</b> {{process for}} {{producing}} solid bars, tubes or wires {{is often used}} to obtain the chipless forming process compared with the conventional process such as the machining and welding operation. Furthermore, machined chip, dust particles, harmful gas, and surface contamination to be commonly generated at hot working during the conventional process could be eliminated as the <b>swaging</b> process is applied and conducted at room temperature. Experiments for <b>swaged</b> product were performed to analyze the influence of the <b>swaging</b> process on the mechanical properties and dimensional precision in terms of surface roughness, surface hardness, and deviation of formed dimension. The changes of dimensional precision in <b>swaged</b> product are also checked out and considered for various process parameters such as the forming speed and the reduction in the outer diameter. Based on the experimental results, the surface roughness is improved under the <b>swaging</b> process. The weight of rod shift is reduced by about 15 % from 223. 5 g to 190. 2 g. Thus the number of operations to produce the final product under the conventional process is larger than that under the <b>swaging</b> process to be able to omit the machining and welding operation, etc. This paper demonstrates that a rotary <b>swaging</b> process turns out to be an environment-friendly forming process or chipless forming process without the machined chip...|$|R

25|$|In {{ammunition}} manufacture, <b>swaged</b> bullets are bullets {{manufactured by}} compressing metal {{at room temperature}} into a die to form it {{into the shape of}} a bullet.

40|$|Micro rotary <b>swaging</b> is a {{cold forming}} process for {{production}} of micro components with determined geometry and surface.

2500|$|Removal of the primer, called decapping, in {{reference}} to primers being often previously called primer caps or just caps, is usually done with a die containing a steel pin that punches out the primer. Berdan primed cases require a different technique, either a hydraulic ram or a hook that punctures the case and levers it out from the bottom. Military cases often have crimped-in primers, and decapping them leaves a slightly indented ring (most common) or, for some military cartridges, a set of stabbed ridges located {{on the edge of}} the primer pocket opening that inhibits or prevents seating a new primer into a decapped case. A reamer or a <b>swage</b> is used to remove both these styles of crimp, whether ring crimps or stab crimps.
