40|$|International <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> are {{foundational}} {{instruments in}} a transnational investment regime that governs how states regulate the foreign-owned assets {{and the foreign}} investment activities of private actors. Over 3, 000 <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> between states govern key governmental powers and {{form the basis for}} an emerging transnational investment regime. This transnational regime significantly decentralizes, denationalizes, and privatizes decision-making and policy choices over foreign <b>investment.</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>agreements</b> set limits to state action {{in a number of areas}} of vital public concern, including the protection of human and labour rights, the environment, and sustainable development. They determine the distribution of power between foreign investors and host states and their societies. However, the societies in which they operate seldom have any input into the terms or operation of these agreements, raising crucial questions of their democratic legitimacy as mechanisms of governance. This paper draws on political science and law to explore the political economy of international <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> and asks whether these agreements are potential vehicles for promoting international human rights. The analysis provides an historical account of the investment regime, while a review of the political economy of international <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> identifies what appears to be a paradox at the core of their operation. It then examines contract theory for insight into this apparent paradox and considers whether <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> are suitable mechanisms for advancing international human rights...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{its limited}} competences, the EU often concludes trade and <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> in the “mixed” form, which implies long and {{uncertain}} ratification procedures. This paper {{suggests that the}} Union may bypass {{some of the problems}} created by “mixed” procedures by giving provisional application to trade and <b>investment</b> <b>agreements.</b> The analysis demonstrates that a provisionally applied agreement produces legal effects, and may therefore ensure a certain degree of legal certainty. Secondly, it is submitted that the provisional application of EU trade and <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> covers a large part of their substantive scope. Finally, it is contended that provisional application ensures a rather stable legal framework, because only the Union (and not its Member States) can decide to terminate it. Provisional application thus appears as a pragmatic instrument, that enables the Union to swiftly bring trade and <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> into application, and consequently enhances the effectiveness of the EU’s external policy...|$|R

This article focuses on the overlap of two protective regimes, intellectual property rights (IPRs) and international <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> (IIAs), as applied to certain intangible objects, such as an invention, a distinctive mark or the expression of an artistic work. More specifically, we analyse the interactions between the different regulatory layers and provisions that govern the possibility of bringing IPRs {{under the protection of}} IIAs. After some general remarks on the references to IPRs in <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> (II), we focus on three main understandings of such interactions (III), namely delegation (by an <b>investment</b> <b>agreement</b> to domestic law), autonomy (of the definition of IPRs in <b>investment</b> <b>agreements),</b> and articulation (of all the relevant regulatory layers to circumscribe the scope of the legally-protected object).

40|$|International {{trade and}} <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> {{are one of}} the primary {{instruments}} of global financial liberalisation. They are enacted to enhance the flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) between signatories by reducing regulatory barriers to investment; promoting stable host investment environments; and guaranteeing investors against non-commercial risk. As a net capital importer, Australia has sought to attract FDI through participation in such accords since the early 1980 s. This paper examines the determinants of Australia’s inward FDI flows—focussing specifically on the effects of trade and <b>investment</b> <b>agreements.</b> Using panel data, we find that both bilateral trade and bilateral and multilateral <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> attract FDI flows into Australia, thereby indicating that the policy of enticing FDI through participation in these accords is quite possibly effective. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} the {{evolution}} of European Union law in the matter of foreign direct investment on bilateral <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> concluded by the Member States before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon brought foreign direct investment under the exclusive European Union competence. The impact of this new competence on bilateral <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> between Member States and third countries might not be strong. First, it only covers protection of direct investments, strictly conceived, whereas bilateral <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> also concern all investments and their promotion. Second, the new exclusive competence of the Union should not affect the validity of the bilateral <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> concluded before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Nonetheless, the Member States have lost their competence in foreign direct investment although the European Union has not exercised its competence yet. That's why a new regulation establishes transitional arrangements for bilateral <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> between Member States and third countries. It allows maintaining bilateral <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> notified to the Commission until the European Union concludes treaties with the same foreign countries but the Member States must cooperate with the Commission and obtain the authorizations to open formal negotiations and to sign the amended agreements. Those agreements will probably be maintained in force but the Commission might use its powers to obtain a modification of the bilateral <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> which makes them compatible with European Union law and assures the coherence with the European external policy, before those agreements are replaced by future agreements of the European Union relating to the same subject matter. Le traité de Lisbonne a élargi la compétence de l'Union en matière de politique commerciale commune au domaine des investissements directs étrangers. Cette compétence apporte des éléments de réponse à l'interrogation sur l'avenir des nombreux traités bilatéraux de protection et de promotion des investissements (TBI) conclus par les États membres avec des États tiers, notamment ceux conclus avec les pays de l'ASEAN. La version publiée est actualisée pour tenir compte de l'adoption en décembre 2012 du règlement établissant des dispositions transitoires pour les accords bilatéraux d'investissement conclus entre des États membres et des pays tiers, qui donne à la Commission moins de pouvoirs que ce qu'elle proposait. On peut penser qu'elle les utilisera pour inciter les États à renégocier ces TBI qui devraient donc être maintenus mais éventuellement modifiés par les États membres dans l'attente de nouveaux accords, probablement mixtes...|$|R

40|$|Does European {{business}} {{lobby for}} international <b>investment</b> <b>agreements?</b> In the public debate, international investment policymaking {{has become almost}} synonymous with a policy domain subject to an undue influence of business on policy outcomes. This paper argues that business preferences and lobbying have little effect on outcomes in international investment policy.
