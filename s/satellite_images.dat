5|$|Alpha's origins {{were from}} a {{tropical}} wave that developed near the Windward Islands on October20. <b>Satellite</b> <b>images</b> indicated that a low pressure center associated with the tropical wave formed near Barbados and moved west-northwest with increasing convective activity.

On October22, the {{area of low pressure}} organized into Tropical Depression 25, southeast of Hispaniola. Shortly thereafter, satellite imagery indicated that a closed circulation had developed, and the associated convection had started banding.

40|$|Abstract—This letter {{presents}} {{a method for}} <b>satellite</b> <b>image</b> classification aiming at the following two objectives: 1) involving visual attention into the <b>satellite</b> <b>image</b> classification; biologically inspired saliency information is exploited in the phase of the image representation, making our method more concentrated on the interesting objects and structures, and 2) handling the <b>satellite</b> <b>image</b> classification without the learning phase. A two-layer sparse coding (TSC) model is designed to discover the “true ” neighbors of the images and bypass the intensive learning phase of the <b>satellite</b> <b>image</b> classification. The underlying philosophy of the TSC is that an image can be more sparsely reconstructed via the images (sparse I) belonging to the same category (sparse II). The images are classified according to a newly defined “image-to-category” similarity based on the coding coefficients. Requiring no training phase, our method achieves very promising results. The experi-mental comparisons are shown on a real <b>satellite</b> <b>image</b> database. Index Terms—Satellite image classification, two-layer sparse coding (TSC), visual attention. I...|$|R

5|$|Charley {{originated}} {{with a large}} swirl of clouds which parted off of {{the west coast of}} Africa on August 9. Lacking deep convection or a well defined center, the wave continued west-northwestward without developing. Ten days later, on August 19, <b>satellite</b> <b>images</b> indicated the disturbance was beginning to rotate cyclonically over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. A reconnaissance aircraft flew into the system the next day. While strong winds were recorded, no circulation center was present. The following morning, a second flight reported that a center had formed, and the disturbance was designated a tropical depression. Initially, the center was disorganized. However, convection over the depression blossomed, mostly concentrated over the northern semicircle. During the evening of August 21, the system was named Tropical Storm Charley.|$|E
5|$|Early on August28, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{an unusually}} vigorous tropical wavean elongated area of low air pressureinland over West Africa. Trailed by widespread cloudiness, the wave tracked {{toward the open}} Atlantic as it developed a broad cyclonic rotation within the lower atmosphere near Guinea's coastline. The disturbance veered toward the northwest and entered the ocean off Conakry around 18:00UTC, August29. By that time, the NHC was predicting a favorable environment for tropical cyclone development within the next 48hours; heavy thunderstorms thrived overnight and consolidated near a well-defined low-pressure center. Around midnight August30, <b>satellite</b> <b>images</b> and scatterometer data confirmed that a tropical depression had formed about 300miles (480km) west-northwest of Conakry, with wind speeds of 35mph (55km/h).|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Hernan re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean, and the NHC noted that possibility for the depression to restrengthen into a tropical storm. Hernan weakened further as a large portion of its circulation remained on land, while the low-level center became difficult to locate. By 2100 UTC October 4, <b>satellite</b> <b>images</b> and surface reports indicated that Hernan had degenerated into a broad area of low pressure.

Minimum pressure lowered to , and the maximum winds increased to 100mph, Category2 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm quickly reached Category3, a major hurricane, and soon after, Category4. As it did so, its eye became ragged, while its lateral {{movement to the}} northwest rose to 17mph around the southern periphery of a strong deep-layer ridge over the United States. By September 1, the hurricane reached its peak intensity of 160mph (260km/h) and a minimum pressure of 921mb (hPa). It had reached Category5, the second of three such powerful storms that would do so during the season.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Cindy {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave that departed the western coast of Africa on August8, 1993.

5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Debby {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on September 4.

Encountering northwesterly vertical wind shear, convection markedly decreased and weakened on the following day, only to redevelop on September8 after the shear dropped. Post-analysis indicate that the sixth tropical depression of the season developed on September 9 at 1200UTC, about 185mi (300km) east of Barbados; however, it was not operationally classified as Tropical Depression Six until almost 24hours later.

5|$|Upon {{attaining}} typhoon status, Meranti turned {{towards the}} northeast {{in response to}} a strengthening near-equatorial ridge south of the typhoon. Visible <b>satellite</b> <b>images</b> of the typhoon depicted a small, ragged eye within a well-developed cyclone. Gale-force winds extended 155km (100mi) at this time. Well-developed outflow allowed the storm to maintain its peak intensity for roughly 18hours before dry air became entrained in the circulation. The combined effects of decreasing sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear caused Meranti to quickly weaken. By 0600UTC on August6, the eye was no longer visible on satellite imagery and several hours later deep convection rapidly diminished, leading to both agencies downgrading the typhoon to a tropical storm.|$|E
