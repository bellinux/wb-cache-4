40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} defect {{detection}} method that {{can find the}} surface irregularity of the car <b>side</b> <b>protector.</b> The Variance Of Variance (VOV) method is used to detect the defects on various types of surface textures. The object surface of the car <b>side</b> <b>protector</b> usually has smooth or textured plane, including defects with intensive irregularity. Conventional variance detection algorithms are not adequate for detecting various defect types of multiple scales and intensity variations. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to propose a method that can find defections of different scales in a single framework. This method can detect defects of different sizes by changing the window’s size, which is combined with integral image method for real time processing of inspection. The image input is first, divided by rows and columns and can help in making small patches ready to be analyzed. The size of patch can then be changed and mixed to produce multiple responses. Due to the introduction of the integral image method, the computing performance of the probabilistic values in the patches is clearly improved. From the results of the experiments that used in real images, it is verified that the method can be applied to detect the defects of images for irregular and textured intensity under uneven illumination...|$|E

60|$|The herd {{had opened}} up; the mothers had fallen {{back to the}} rear; the calves hung almost out of sight under the shaggy <b>sides</b> of <b>protectors.</b> To try them out Jones darted close and threw his lasso. It struck a cow. With {{activity}} incredible in such a huge beast, she lunged at him. Kentuck, expecting just such a move, wheeled to safety. This duel, ineffectual on both sides, kept up for a while, and all the time, man and herd were jogging rapidly to the north.|$|R
50|$|A limited-run Magna V6 Si, {{based on}} the Executive sedan, {{launched}} in September 2001. Its main features included by 16-inch alloy wheels, cruise control and power windows as standard.

50|$|The {{line was}} never on a firm {{financial}} footing {{and the situation}} worsened with {{the rising cost of}} coal and the effects of the First World War; additionally competition from Dymond's Horse Drawn Coach and later Motor Buses took much of the traffic off the line even in summer. Few passengers from Bideford Station at East-The-Water would trouble to change again for the B,WH&A,R at the Quay when alternative transport would take them straight to their destination for less money. Trains did not run at times suitable for manual workers and freight, apart from Westward Ho! Gasworks, had always been a minor consideration. The line could not even manage the ½% dividend of the Lynton & Barnstaple Railway and eventual closure was inevitable. In 1917, the Minister of Munitions requisitioned the line by Government Order for War Service and it duly closed on 28 March of that year. Grenville and Torridge were loaded onto the captured German freighter Gotterdammerung for duty in France, but the ship was torpedoed off the north Cornwall Coast and sank. The wreck was discovered in 2001 and the locomotives may be recovered for restoration as static displays. Kingsley was scrapped in 1937 after having been sold by the Ministry of Munitions to the National Smelting Company.The locomotives, derailing several times, had to be run across the medieval Bideford Bridge on temporarily laid track, then running along Barnstaple Street joining up with the old L.& S.W.R.line at Bideford's Goods Yard.

2500|$|For 2004 both coupe and sedans were altered, with updated {{interiors}} {{and improved}} transmissions. The five-speed automatic transmission on the 350GT Premium now included synchro rev control, while the 6-speed manual transmission {{was made to}} vibrate less. For the sedan, the front grill/bumper, foot panel, head lamp, rear bumper, and rear combination lamps were changed. The front seats received active head rest, while the rear middle seat now have a three-point seat belt as standard. There were also some new wheels and a 19-inch option for the coupé. The Skyline's 2005 update again included changes to the head and rear lamps, front bumper, and <b>side</b> sill <b>protectors.</b> Also, 19-inch aluminium alloy wheel became standard for automatic transmission cars. A [...] "plasma cluster ion" [...] full air conditioner with left/right independent temperature settings, heated door mirrors, head lamp auto levelizer (compliant with new legislation) was made standard equipment.|$|R
50|$|The mini-comics did not muddle who {{the good}} guys and bad guys were, unlike the comics, where the {{functions}} the Starriors were built for meant little to where their loyalties lay. Most notably {{in the cases of}} Sawtooth, who had always been sympathetic to the Protectors, and Auntie Tank, who questioned her loyalties throughout the mini-series before finally <b>siding</b> with the <b>Protectors,</b> too. The Protector Motormouth was revealed to be a spy for Slaughter Steelgrave as well. When the first human is released, it is decided that the Starriors retain their own identity and remain active amongst the humans. However, Slaughter Steelgrave remains to be reasoned with.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAs the {{proposition}} of the ‘Internet plus’ concept and speedy progress of new media technology, traditional business have been increasingly {{shared in the}} development fruits of the informatization and the networking. Proceeding from the real plant protection demands, {{the construction of a}} cloud-based video monitoring system that surveillances diseases and pests in apple orchards has been discussed, aiming to solve the lack of timeliness and comprehensiveness in the control of diseases and pests in apple orchards. The system can not only monitor the growth state of all apple trees in orchards, but also detect apple trees’ diseases and pests. The system featured a camera located under tree canopies that could precisely detect diseases and pests {{on the back of the}} leaves. On the cloud storage service <b>side,</b> plant <b>protectors</b> can get hold of the situation of apple trees’ diseases and pests by using the software installed in a smartphone or a computer. The system provided pinpoint surveillance data and determining criterions for the control of diseases and pests of fruit trees, which had a great realistic meaning to the development of agricultural and rural informatization...|$|R
40|$|Microprobing is {{an attack}} {{technique}} against integrated circuits implementing security functions, such as OTP tokens or smartcards. It allows intercepting secrets from onchip wires as well as injecting faults for other attacks. While the necessity to etch open chip packages and to remove the passivation layer makes microprobing appear expensive, it was shown that a successful attack can be run with equipment worth a few thousand euros. On the <b>protector’s</b> <b>side,</b> however, appropriate countermeasures such as active shields, redundancy of core components, or analog detection circuits containing large capacitors, are still expensive. We present a resource efficient microbing detection circuit that we call Low Area Probing Detector (LAPD). It measures minimal timing differences between on-chip wires caused by the capacitive load of microprobes. Simulations show that it can detect up-todate probes with capacitances as low as 10 fF. As a novelty, the LAPD is merely based on digital components and does not require analog circuitry, which reduces the required area and process steps compared to previous approaches.

5000|$|All {{models are}} now {{available}} with painted exterior door handles, with black exterior side mirrors on the base level 2.5i, and painted mirrors on Premium and Limited. The Limited can be identified externally by simulated aluminium surround for the front foglights and matching trim piece on the bottom edges of the <b>side</b> door sill <b>protector,</b> front, and rear bumpers; the Premium and base model remain black. The grille appearance is unique on North American models so as to provide a visual similarity to the larger facelifted Tribeca and the third generation Forester. The 2.5i uses the flat-4 engine with 6-speed manual transmission or the optional Lineartronic Continuously variable transmission with steering column-mounted paddle shifters that allows the driver to select 6 [...] "virtual gears" [...] in manual mode. The 3.6R uses the flat-6 engine (from the Subaru Tribeca) exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The conventional automatic transmission is only available with the flat-6 engine, and the 6-speed manual transmission is not available on the 2.5i Limited. The PZEV Outback 2.5i, identified by a badge attached {{to the rear of}} the vehicle, continues to be sold in all 50 states, unlike other manufacturers who only sell PZEV certified vehicles in states that have adopted California emission standards. All other models have been certified LEV2 or ULEV.|$|R
