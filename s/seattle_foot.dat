50|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>Seattle</b> <b>Foot</b> (Seattle Limb Systems) in 1981 revolutionized the field, bringing {{the concept of an}} Energy Storing Prosthetic Foot (ESPF) to the fore. Other companies soon followed suit, and before long, there were multiple models of energy storing prostheses on the market. Each model utilized some variation of a compressible heel. The heel is compressed during initial ground contact, storing energy which is then returned during the latter phase of ground contact to help propel the body forward.|$|E
50|$|High Point is {{so named}} {{because it is the}} highest point of land in <b>Seattle,</b> 520 <b>feet</b> (158 m) above sea level. It is most well known for the {{recently}} demolished World War II temporary worker housing project of the same name that for five decades(1952-2002) served as low income housing, in particular for many refugees and immigrants when they first arrived in Seattle.|$|R
50|$|In 1890, the company's {{main office}} was in West Seattle, {{at the corner}} of Railroad and Grand streets. The company had a branch office in <b>Seattle,</b> at the <b>foot</b> of Marion Street. The company's ferry ticket agent was Arthur I. Gould.|$|R
50|$|In 1858, Smith was {{appointed}} Lighthouse Agent for Washington Territory. In 1859 {{he surveyed the}} Puget Sound Guide Meridian from the area just north of <b>Seattle</b> to within <b>feet</b> of the international boundary with British Columbia. Smith {{was appointed}} chief registrar of the General Land Office in Seattle in 1860 and was an aide-de-camp to Governor Isaac Stevens.|$|R
5|$|Mount Baker {{station is}} located {{west of the}} Rainier Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Way {{intersection}} in the Mount Baker neighborhood of <b>Seattle,</b> at the <b>foot</b> of Beacon Hill. The area surrounding the station consists of single-family detached homes and retail big-box stores, housing 6,675 and employing 2,208 respectively. Nearby pedestrian amenities include a bus station for King County Metro routes one block northeast and an overpass of Rainier Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Way connecting to Mount Baker Boulevard and Franklin High School.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The gait {{characteristics}} {{of persons with}} unilateral transtibial amputations are fairly well documented in the litera-ture. However, much less {{is known about the}} gait of persons with bilateral transtibial amputations. This study used quantitative gait analysis to investigate the gait {{characteristics of}} 19 persons with bilateral transtibial amputations. To reduce variability between subjects, we fitted all subjects with <b>Seattle</b> Lightfoot II <b>feet</b> 2 weeks before their gait analyses. The data indicated that subjects walked with symmetrical temporospatial, kinematic, and kinetic parameters. Compared with nondisabled controls, the subjects with amputations walked with slower speeds and lower cadences, had shorter step lengths and wider step widths, and displayed hip hiking during swing phase. Additionally, compared with the non-disabled controls walking at comparable speeds, the subjects with amputations demonstrated reduced ankle dorsiflexion and kne...|$|R
40|$|In North America and Europe, {{the elderly}} {{represent}} {{the largest percentage}} of individuals with a below the knee amputation. The purpose of this thesis was to compare two types of prosthetic feet, the Solid Ankle Cushion Heel (SACH) <b>foot</b> and the <b>Seattle</b> Light (SEAT-L) <b>foot</b> in a group of elderly unilateral below knee amputees (EBKA) during walking at a natural cadence. Ten EBKA aged 70. 4 « 9. 5 years and 18 healthy elderly (HE) subjects aged 70. 8 « 7. 0 years participated in this study; selection criteria required that the EBKA demonstrate sufficient locomotor potential in order to benefit from the SEAT-L foot's energy return capability. The EBKA underwent an initial gait evaluation with the SACH foot, this was followed by an eight session gait retraining program specific to the SEAT-L foot. Upon completion of the gait program, the EBKA underwent a final gait evaluation with the SEAT-L foot. In order to serve as a reference group, the 18 HE subject's gait was also evaluated once.

40|$|Some {{important}} walking {{functions are}} adversely affected or eliminated in prosthesis users because of reduced or absent ankle motion. This retrospective data analysis determined {{the effect of}} prosthetic ankle units {{on the characteristics of}} the ankle-foot roll-over shape in persons with bilateral transtibial amputations. Seventeen subjects were fitted with Endolite Multiflex Ankles to provide ankle plantar-/dorsiflexion during the stance phase of gait. Quantitative gait analyses were performed as subjects walked with (1) <b>Seattle</b> Lightfoot II <b>feet</b> (baseline condition) and (2) the prosthetic ankle units added. Roll-over shape radii and effective foot length ratio were calculated and compared for the two prosthetic configurations. When subjects walked with the ankle units, ankle motion increased (p < 0. 001), peak ankle plantarflexion moment during stance decreased slightly, and ankle-foot roll-over shape radii were significantly decreased (p < 0. 001) compared with the baseline condition. The effective foot length ratio of the roll-over shape was found to increase with walking speed (p < 0. 001), but it was not significantly affected by the prosthetic ankle units (p = 0. 07). Prosthetists and manufacturers are encouraged to consider the effect of combining prosthetic components on the overall characteristics of the prosthesis and the functions they impart to the user...|$|R
