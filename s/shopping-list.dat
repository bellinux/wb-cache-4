He uses the following {{as an example}} from The Crossing: [...] "He ate {{the last of the}} eggs and wiped the plate with the tortilla and ate the tortilla and drank the last of the coffee and wiped his mouth and looked up and thanked her." [...] Myers follows: [...] "This {{is a good example of}} what I call the andelope: a breathless string of simple declarative statements linked by the conjunction [...] "and". Like the [...] "evocative" [...] slide-show and the Consumerland <b>shopping-list,</b> the andelope encourages skim-reading while keeping up the appearance of 'literary' length and complexity. But like the slide-show (and unlike the <b>shopping-list),</b> the andelope often clashes with the subject matter, and the unpunctuated flow of words bears no relation to the methodical meal that is being described." ...|$|E

The parties to the alleged contract had never met or communicated with each other directly. Nor had they exchanged goods, money or services between themselves. The law of contract is used by the court as an instrument for discouraging misleading and extravagant claims in advertising and for deterring the marketing of unproven, and perhaps dangerous pharmaceuticals... The judges run through a <b>shopping-list</b> of questions: Was there a promise? Was the promise serious and intended to be acted upon? Was the promise sufficiently definite and certain? Was the promise accepted by the plaintiff? Did the plaintiff perform some action in exchange for the promise?... The generality and abstraction of the rules permit both the extensive utilization of law and its application to the case, without any discussion of such matters as the moral claims of the parties, the nature of the market for pharmaceuticals and the problems generated by misleading advertising... Its doctrinal integrity helps to achieve legitimacy, because the law can be presented as objective and neutral, not a matter of politics or preference, but a settled body of rules and principles, legitimated by tradition and routine observance, and applied impartially and fairly to all citizens." ...|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the camp}} was {{established}} at Mousehold the rebels drew {{up a list of}} 29 grievances, signed by Kett, Codd, Aldrich and the representatives of the Hundreds, and sent it to Protector Somerset. The grievances have been described by one historian as a <b>shopping-list</b> of demands but which nevertheless have a strong logic underlying them, articulating [...] "a desire to limit the power of the gentry, exclude them from the world of the village, constrain rapid economic change, prevent the overexploitation of communal resources, and remodel the values of the clergy". Although the rebels were all the while tearing down hedges and filling in ditches, only one of the 29 articles mentioned enclosure: 'We pray your grace that where it is enacted for enclosing, that it be not hurtful to such as have enclosed saffren grounds, for they be greatly chargeable to them, and that from henceforth no man shall enclose any more.' The exemption for 'saffren grounds' has puzzled historians; one has suggested that {{it may have been a}} scribal error for 'sovereign grounds', grounds that were the exclusive freehold property of their owners, while others have commented on the importance of saffron to local industry. The rebels also asked 'that all bondmen may be made free, for God made all free, with his precious blood shedding.' The rebels may have been articulating a grievance against the 1547 Act for the Punishment of Vagabonds, which made it legal to enslave a discharged servant who did not find a new master within three days, though they may also have been calling for the manumission of the thousands of Englishmen and women who were serfs. [...] (In 1549, an Act Touching on the Punishment of Vagabonds and Other Idle Persons avoided the word [...] "slave" [...] but retained many of the harshest provisions of the 1547 Act.) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{hand-held}} {{scanning device}} that let customers scan their own groceries {{has recently been}} introduced on the market. The aim with this self-scanning system is to develop the grocery shopping procedure, hopefully leading to mutual benefits for customers as well as store-owners. Since this hand-held device just reached the market {{it is an interesting}} subject to study. By carrying out a survey and employing a heuristic evaluation we found that improvements concerning language issues, mapping between buttons and the layout of the hand-held scanning device could be made even though the GUI was easy to understand. This paper describes the evaluation of the user interface belonging to a self-scanning system and suggests improvements as well as new features interconnected with a prototype. Our evaluation concludes that new features are of importance in providing value to the customers. Therefore, we suggest a <b>shopping-list,</b> an allergy alert and information about the origin of each product.

40|$|This paper {{reports from}} a project, called NewsPilot, where we explore how context aware {{computing}} {{can be used}} to support mobile collaborators. An empirical study of journalists at a local radio station in Sweden has informed the design of a prototype system. The system is built using a personal digital assistant (PDA) fitted with a radio transceiver and filters information based on the users physical location in relation to geographic places and other users. Keywords CSCW, Context aware computing, Field study. INTRODUCTION The perhaps most common "filter" in everyday life is information selection based on location. So trivial, it is almost difficult to appreciate we tend to place information tags where they are most appropriate. We place the <b>shopping-list</b> on the refrigerator or the front door, but rarely in the bedroom. If we are looking for books on Software Engineering at the library, we will go to the section on computing to filter out all other types of books. However, the past [...] ...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{dominant}} tradition in Christianity and many other religions, human beings are both knowers and actors: beings with conscious beliefs about the world who sometimes act intentionally guided by these beliefs. According to philosopher of mind Robert Cummins the “received view” among philosophers of mind is epiphenomenalism, according to which mental causation does not exist: neural events are {{the underlying causes of}} both behavior and belief which explains the correlation (not causation) between belief and behavior. Beliefs do not, in virtue of their semantic content, enter the causal chain leading to action, beliefs are always the endpoint of a causal chain. If that is true the theological anthropology of many religious traditions is false. JP Moreland draws attention to two different ways of doing metaphysics: serious metaphysics and <b>shopping-list</b> metaphysics. The difference is that the former involves not only the attempt to describe  the phenomena one encounter, it also involves the attempt of locating them, that is explaining how the phenomena is possible and came to be given the constraints of a certain worldview. For a physicalist these constraints include the atomic theory of matter and the theories of physical, chemical and biological evolution.   Mental properties are challenging phenomena to locate within a physicalist worldview, and some physicalists involved in “serious metaphysics” have therefore eliminated them from their worldview. Most however accept them, advocating “non-reductive physicalism” according to which mental properties supervene on physical processes. Even if one allow mental properties to supervene on physical processes, the problem of mental causation remains. If mental properties are irreducible to and therefore distinct from physical properties, as the non-reductive physicalists claim, they cannot exert causal powers if one accepts the causal closure of the physical domain – which one must, if one is a “serious physicalist” according to physicalist philosopher of mind Jaegwon Kim.   Alvin Plantinga, in his Evolutionary Argument against Naturalism, shows that if mental properties, such as the propositional content of beliefs, are causally inefficacious, then evolution has not been selecting cognitive faculties that are reliable, in the sense of being conducive to true beliefs. If the content of our beliefs does not affect our behavior, the content of our belief is irrelevant from an evolutionary standpoint, and so the content-producing part of our cognitive faculties are irrelevant from an evolutionary standpoint. The “reliability” – truth-conduciveness – of our cognitive faculties can therefore not be explained by evolution, and therefore not located within the physicalist worldview. The only way in which the reliability of our cognitive faculties can be located is if propositional content is relevant for behavior.   If we however eliminate or deny the reliability of our cognitive faculties, then we have abandoned any chance of making a rational case for our position, as that would presuppose the reliability that we are denying. But if propositional content is causally efficacious, then that either – if we are non-reductive physicalists and mental properties are taken to be irreducible to physical properties – implies that the causal closure of the physical domain is false or - if we are reductive physicalists and not eliminativists regarding mental properties - it shows that matter qua matter can govern itself by rational argumentation, in which we have a pan-/localpsychistic view of matter. Either way, we have essentially abandoned physicalism in the process of locating the reliability of our cognitive faculties within a physicalist worldview. We have also affirmed the theological anthropology of Christianity, in so far as the capacity for knowledge and rational action is concerned.
