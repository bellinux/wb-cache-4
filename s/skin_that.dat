5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of psoriasis is usually {{based on the}} appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for psoriasis are scaly, erythematous plaques, papules, or patches of <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> may be painful and itch. No special blood tests or diagnostic procedures are needed to make the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|A {{subgroup}} of solar urticaria, fixed solar urticaria, {{has also been}} identified. It is a rare, less intense form of the disease with wheals (swollen areas of the <b>skin)</b> <b>that</b> affect certain, fixed areas of the body. Fixed solar urticaria is induced by {{a broad spectrum of}} radiative energy with wavelengths ranging from 300–700nm.|$|E
25|$|Many {{websites}} are skinnable, {{particularly those}} that provide social capabilities. Some sites provide <b>skins</b> <b>that</b> make primarily cosmetic changes, while some—such as H2G2—offer <b>skins</b> <b>that</b> make major changes to page layout. As with standalone software interfaces, this is facilitated by the underlying technology of the website—XML and XSLT, for instance, facilitate major changes of layout, while CSS can easily produce different visual styles.|$|R

5|$|A typical fish is ectothermic, has a {{streamlined}} body for rapid swimming, extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to breathe atmospheric oxygen, has {{two sets of}} paired fins, usually one or two (rarely three) dorsal fins, an anal fin, and a tail fin, has jaws, has <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> is usually covered with scales, and lays eggs.|$|E
5|$|The hatchling's {{ability to}} survive winter in the nest has allowed the painted turtle to extend its range further north than any other American turtle. The painted turtle is genetically adapted to survive {{extended}} periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain supercooled and <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground. The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{microscopic}} exocrine glands in the <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> secrete an oily or waxy matter, called sebum, {{to lubricate}} and waterproof {{the skin and}} hair of mammals. In humans, they occur in the greatest number on the face and scalp, but also on {{all parts of the}} skin except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The type of secretion of the sebaceous glands is referred to as holocrine.|$|E

5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are part}} of the body's {{integumentary}} system and serve to protect the body against germs. Sebaceous glands secrete acids that form the acid mantle. This is a very fine, slightly acidic film {{on the surface of the}} <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> acts as a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other potential contaminants that might penetrate the skin. The pH of the skin is between 4.5 and 6.2, and this acidity helps to neutralise the primarily alkaline nature of contaminants.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the onefin electric ray is wider than long and almost circular in shape. The two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{beneath the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. The eyes are small and protruding; the larger spiracles lie closely behind and have three small finger-like projections on their rims. The nostrils are placed rather close together, and between them is a long skirt-like flap of <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> reaches the mouth. The small and protrusible mouth is nearly straight and surrounded by prominent furrows. The teeth are tiny and pointed. There are five pairs of small gill slits on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|The sharptooth houndshark is a stout-bodied {{species with}} a short, thick, and blunt snout. The {{nostrils}} are widely spaced and preceded by lobe-like flaps of <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> do {{not reach the}} mouth. The horizontally oval eyes have ridges underneath and are equipped with nictitating membranes. The large mouth bears long, deep furrows at the corners, with those on the lower jaw almost meeting in the middle. The teeth are small and tightly packed to form pavement-like surfaces. Each tooth has a rounded, molar-like base that rises to a sharp, upright central cusp; rarely, a pair of barely developed lateral cusplets may also be present. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
25|$|All {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} should be rinsed before eating. This recommendation also applies to produce with rinds or <b>skins</b> <b>that</b> are not eaten. It should be done just before preparing or eating to avoid premature spoilage.|$|R
5000|$|Skin: Exterior {{surfaces}} now change every {{twenty years}} or so, {{to keep up}} with fashion or technology, or for wholesale repair. Recent focus on energy costs has led to re-engineered <b>skins</b> <b>that</b> are air-tight and better-insulated.|$|R

5|$|Thomcord grape is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson Seedless grape (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in {{supermarkets}} during the summer, and seeded Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make grape juice and jelly. It is a plump, juicy, seedless table grape and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> clings to the flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.|$|E
5|$|Two genetic health {{concerns}} {{seen in the}} breed are von Willebrand disease (vWD) and craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO); Scottie cramp, patellar luxation and cerebellar abiotrophy are also sometimes seen in this breed. Common eye conditions seen {{in a variety of}} breeds such as cataracts and glaucoma can appear in Scotties as they age. There are no specific conditions relating the <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> affect the breed, but they can be affected by common dog related conditions such as parasites and mange. Scotties typically live from 11 to 13 years.|$|E
5|$|Under each foreleg, the {{sea otter}} has a loose pouch of <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> extends across the chest. In this pouch (preferentially the left one), the animal stores {{collected}} food {{to bring to}} the surface. This pouch also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams. There, the sea otter eats while floating on its back, using its forepaws to tear food apart and bring it to its mouth. It can chew and swallow small mussels with their shells, whereas large mussel shells may be twisted apart. It uses its lower incisor teeth to access the meat in shellfish.|$|E
50|$|Autoimmune {{estrogen}} dermatitis presents as a cyclic <b>skin</b> disorder, <b>that</b> {{may appear}} eczematous, papular, bullous, or urticarial. with pruritus typically present, <b>skin</b> eruptions <b>that</b> may be chronic but which are exacerbated premenstrually or occur immediately following menses.|$|R

5|$|Effects artist Scott Stoddard {{described}} his look for Jason's face {{as a combination}} of Carl Fullerton's design for Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's design for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen. Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back {{to give the impression}} that Jason had scoliosis. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements. Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso. He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2010, SOPHIA the 3rd made an {{appearance}} in the Flash game Super Mario Bros. Crossover, in its Version1.2 release. In the game, the tank possesses all abilities from Blaster Master and is the first character in the game to have a limited supply of ammunition; players need to collect power-ups from enemies in order to fire homing missiles, which is necessary to defeat Buzzy Beetles, Spike Tops, and Bullet Bills. The version also allows SOPHIA to grapple onto ceilings. On December 21, 2012, the game was updated to include, among other skins, a <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> changes the level, enemy, and interface graphics to those based on Blaster Master. According to the game's designer, SOPHIA was planned {{to be in the}} game from the beginning along with Ryu Hayabusa and Luigi, although they were left out of the first release due to time.|$|E
5|$|Once {{inside the}} skin, dengue virus binds to Langerhans cells (a {{population}} of dendritic {{cells in the}} <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> identifies pathogens). The virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the Langerhans cell, specifically the C-type lectins called DC-SIGN, mannose receptor and CLEC5A. DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, {{seems to be the}} main point of entry. The dendritic cell moves to the nearest lymph node. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus, the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (glycoproteins). The now mature new viruses are released by exocytosis. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.|$|E
50|$|Inspired by the Fomorians of Celtic myth, {{they are}} {{depicted}} as humanoid, cyclopean creatures with barbed tails and beak-like snouts, with <b>skins</b> <b>that</b> varied {{from a dark}} green to a muddy brown colour. They are described as being part Daemon.|$|R
2500|$|Initially, Valve had {{considered}} <b>skins</b> <b>that</b> appeared as camouflage {{would be more}} desirable to help hide on some maps, but found there was more community interest in bright, colorful <b>skins</b> <b>that</b> made their weapons appear like paintball guns. The addition of skins made the game attractive to expert players, as the skins could {{be taken as a}} kind of trophy, showing off to other players how serious of a player they were. Valve's CEO Gabe Newell described the offering of skins as an [...] "investment" [...] that would retain some nominal value well after the player stopped playing the game, though did state that they had concerns about factors that might fall out of their control with this feature.|$|R
50|$|Tamboriles {{are made}} of wood with animal <b>skins</b> <b>that</b> are rope-tuned or fire-tuned minutes before the performance. They are worn at the waist {{with the aid of}} a {{shoulder}} strap called a talig or talí and played with one stick and one hand.|$|R
5|$|Otters are {{the only}} marine animals {{that are capable of}} lifting and turning over rocks, which they often do with their front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into {{underwater}} mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Under each foreleg, sea otters have a loose pouch of <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and clams, an example of tool use. The sea otters eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. Marine otters mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.|$|E
5|$|The Australian swellshark has a stocky, rounded {{body that}} tapers {{significantly}} to the short caudal peduncle. The head comprises {{no more than a}} fifth of the total length and is broad and moderately flattened, with a very short, thick, blunt snout. The nostrils are divided into small incurrent and excurrent openings by short, triangular flaps of <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> do not reach the mouth. The mouth is extremely large, without furrows at the corners. The teeth are numerous and small with multiple cusps; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. The large, oval eyes are placed somewhat on the upper surface of the head, and have rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and ridges underneath.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese sleeper ray has {{an almost}} {{circular}} pectoral fin disc wider than long. Two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{under the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. The small, protruding eyes are immediately followed by larger spiracles with prominently raised, smooth rims. The nostrils are small and placed close together, and between them is a curtain of <b>skin</b> <b>that</b> overlaps the mouth. The protrusible mouth forms a short, transverse line and is surrounded by a deep groove. There are fewer than 25 tooth rows in each jaw, arranged into bands; the teeth are small with oval bases and pointed crowns. Five pairs of short gill slits are located on the underside of the disc.|$|E
60|$|The {{heat of the}} {{vertical}} {{rays of the sun}} was fast making our horrible prisons unbearable, so that after passing a low divide, and entering a sheltering forest, we finally discarded the Mahar <b>skins</b> <b>that</b> had brought us thus far in safety.|$|R
