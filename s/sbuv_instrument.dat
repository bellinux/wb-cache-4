40|$|Comparisons are {{presented}} of satellite, rocket, and balloon ozone profiles near Natal, Brazil (5. 9 deg S, 35. 2 deg W). The low variability of stratospheric ozone at Natal during March and April of 1985 has allowed intercomparisons of reasonably large data sets, {{rather than a}} small number of paired satellite/in situ comparisons. There are sharp differences between the profile from the <b>SBUV</b> <b>instrument</b> on Nimbus 7 and the in situ measurements. These results support the conclusions of the NASA Ozone Trends Panel that there is an instrumental cause for the very large changes in upper stratospheric ozone seen by SBUV. Along with other comparisons, these results are being used in a reassessment of the <b>SBUV</b> <b>instrument</b> and its data reduction procedures. The agreement between the ozone profiles from the SAGE II instrument on the ERBS satellite and the rocket values is excellent over the full range of comparisons. Both SAGE II and ROCOZ-A must convert from altitude to pressure for intercomparisons with SME and with SBUV-type instruments. The conversion between pressure and altitude {{is as important as the}} ozone measurements, especially in the upper stratosphere where the scale height for ozone is approximately half that for pressure...|$|E

These measurements begin with the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Solar Backscatter UltraViolet (<b>SBUV)</b> <b>instruments</b> on Nimbus 7, launched in late 1978. The measurements have continued with the Meteor 3 TOMS, Earth Probe TOMS, and NOAA 9, 11, 14 SBUV/ 2 instruments. The problem for producing a long-term data set is establishing the relative calibration of the various instruments to better than 1 %. There was a nearly two year gap between the Meteor 3 TOMS and the Earth Probe TOMS. This gap is filled by the NOAA 9 and 11 SBUV/ 2 instruments, but they were in drifting orbits that result in effective gaps in the record when the equator crossing time occurs at large solar zenith angle. We have used recently re-derived calibrations of the <b>SBUV</b> <b>instruments</b> using the D-pair (306 / 313 nm wavelengths) data at the equator. These equatorial D-pair measurements should maintain the internal calibration of each instrument better than previous approaches. We then use the comparisons between instruments during their overlap periods to establish a consistent calibration over the entire data set.

It is suggested that meteoric atoms react with the atmosphere to bond to OH, and subsequently react with HCl to form salts, resulting in the accumulation of chlorine during polar winter. The sudden release of this chlorine from photodissociation of these salts during spring could account for the loss of ozone in the upper atmosphere...|$|E

The SBUV data record spans a 41 yr period from 1970 to 2011 with a 5 yr gap in the 1970 s. The ultimate goal is to create a consistent, well-calibrated data set of ozone profiles {{that can be used for}} climate studies and trend analyses. SBUV ozone profiles have been intensively validated against satellite profile measurements from the Microwave Limb Sounders (MLS) (on board the UARS and Aura satellites) and the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE II) and ground-based observations from the microwave spectrometers, lidars, Umkehr instruments and balloon-borne ozonesondes. In the stratosphere between 25 and 1 hPa the mean biases and standard deviations are mostly within 5 % for monthly zonal mean ozone profiles. Above and below this layer the vertical resolution of the SBUV algorithm decreases. We combine several layers of data in the troposphere/lower stratosphere to account for the lower resolution. The bias in the SBUV tropospheric/lower stratospheric combined layer relative to similarly integrated columns from Aura MLS, ozonesonde and Umkehr instruments varies within 5 %. We also estimate the drift of the <b>SBUV</b> <b>instruments</b> and their potential effect on the long-term stability of the combined data record. Data from the <b>SBUV</b> <b>instruments</b> that collectively cover the 1980 s and 2000 s are very stable, with drifts mostly less than 0. 5 % per year.

40|$|Abstract- Using {{data from}} a series of space-based ozone {{measurement}} systems we are producing a consistent, calibrated ozone time series {{that can be used for}} trend analyses and other studies. To produce the total column ozone time series we use data from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments on Nimbus 7 and Earth Probe, and data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) flying on the Aura spacecraft. Both total column ozone and the ozone vertical profile data are produced from the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (<b>SBUV)</b> <b>instruments</b> on Nimbus 7 and SBUV/ 2 instruments on a series of NOAA spacecraft. A global zonal mean merged ozone data time series covering the period from 1970 - 1972 and 1978 - 2010 has been produced for total column ozone. A similar profile data set has been constructed, but is still in preliminary form due to uncertainty in calibration adjustments as a function of latitude and altitude...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUsing {{coincident}} {{observations of}} total ozone from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and stratospheric ozone profiles from the Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet (<b>SBUV)</b> <b>instruments,</b> detailed maps of tropospheric ozone have been derived {{on a daily}} basis over a time period spanning more than two decades. The resultant climatological seasonal depictions of the tropospheric ozone residual (TOR) show much more detail than an earlier analysis that had used coincident TOMS and Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) ozone profiles, although there are many similarities between the TOMS/SAGE TOR and the TOMS/SBUV TOR climatologies. In particular, both TOR seasonal depictions show large enhancements in the southern tropics and subtropics in austral spring and at northern temperate latitudes during the summer. The much greater detail in this new data set clearly defines the regional aspect of tropospheric ozone pollution in northeastern India, eastern United States, eastern China, and west and southern Africa. Being able to define monthly climatologies for each year of the data record provides enough temporal resolution to illustrate significant interannual variability in some of these regions...|$|R
40|$|Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMCs) are tenuous ice {{clouds that}} form near the cold (3 ̆c 150 K) summer {{mesopause}} region (80 - 85 km). From the ground, these clouds are seen during twilight hours as Noctilucent or “night shining” Clouds (NLCs) and are typically seen from latitudes from 50 ° to 65 °. Observations by the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (<b>SBUV)</b> <b>instruments</b> on the NOAA satellites {{have shown that}} the occurrence and brightness of NLCs have been increasing over the last three decades prompting speculation concerning their possible role in climate change. Recently the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite was launched (April 2007) and is the first satellite dedicated to the study of NLCs. In this report, we compare SBUV and AIM PMC observations with ground-based image data collected during two campaigns from Edmonton, Canada (June 30 -July 17, 2007) and Delta Junction, Alaska (July 29 -August 17, 2007). Four nights of data are discussed where coincident measurements were obtained by AIM, SBUV/ 2 and ground-based imagers.

Analysis {{of data from}} the BUV instrument on Nimbus 4 (1970 - 1978) showed three cases of ozone destruction associated with SPEs near the maximum of solar cycle 20 : during events on January 25 and September 2, 1971, and during the giant event of August 4 - 8, 1972. Data from the <b>SBUV</b> <b>instrument</b> on Nimbus 7 (1978 present) show ozone destruction during five SPEs near the maximum of solar cycle 21 : on June 7, 1979, August 21, 1979, October 13 - 14, 1981, July 13, 1982, and December 8, 1982.

40|$|Stratospheric {{temperatures}} {{for long-term}} and recent trends and {{the determination of}} whether observed changes in upper stratospheric temperatures are consistent with observed ozone changes are discussed. The long-term temperature trends were determined up to 30 mb from radiosonde analysis (since 1970) and rocketsondes (since 1969 and 1973) up to the lower mesosphere, principally in the Northern Hemisphere. The more recent trends (since 1979) incorporate satellite observations. The mechanisms that can produce recent temperature trends in the stratosphere are discussed. The following general effects are discussed: changes in ozone, changes in other radiatively active trace gases, changes in aerosols, changes in solar flux, and dynamical changes. Computations were made to estimate the temperature changes associated with the upper stratospheric ozone changes reported by the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (<b>SBUV)</b> <b>instrument</b> aboard Nimbus- 7 and the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) instruments...|$|E

For each month and latitude zone layer ozone amounts, standard deviations for 12 Umkehr layers (approximately 0 - 60 km), and the average total ozone for each zone are listed. The ozone mixing ratio and number density at the center of each layer are also given. It is found that the average SBUV profiles agree with average Umkehr profiles measured at Boulder to within 10 percent over most of the range. The Krueger-Minizner model is found to be a good representative ozone model for 45 deg N, agreeing with an annual average of measured profiles to better than 10 percent between 20 and 60 km...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} of the Nimbus 7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) {{which was designed}} to observe the spatial characteristics of total ozone that were not resolved by the nadir-viewing Nimbus BUV and <b>SBUV</b> <b>instruments.</b> At the wavelengths suitable for total ozone measurements, the radiance is large enough that the entire daytime atmosphere could be surveyed with about 50 -km resolution from a polar orbiting satellite. The resulting high spatial resolution TOMS ozone images are found to reflect the internal dynamic structure of the lower atmosphere. Features which can be identified and tracked include: planetary wave scale troughs and ridges, mesoscale cutoff lows and rapidly moving troughs, jet stream confluence and difluence areas, hurricanes, and polar night lows. These features control the ozone above any given location and account for nearly all the variance in the total ozone. The instrument has been used to track the volcanic eruption clouds from El Chichon, Mount St. Helens, Alaid, and smaller eruptions such as Galunggung. It would be feasible to use a similar instrument on a geostationary platform to obtain half-hourly maps. Determination of the vertical ozone distribution in the lower stratosphere using Radon transform principles would be of importance in measuring jet stream folds and the related troposphere-stratosphere exchange...|$|R
40|$|Comparison of Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data to {{the network}} of {{ground-based}} Dobson/Brewer measurements reveals difference in the time dependence of the calibration of the two systems. We have been searching for a method to determine the time dependence of the TOMS calibrations that is independent of the Dobson/Brewer network. In a separate paper by DeLand et al., calibrations of the Solar Backscatter UV Spectrometer (<b>SBUV)</b> <b>instruments</b> have been rederived using the D-pair (306 / 313 nm wavelengths) data at the equator. These calibrations have been applied to {{the data from the}} Nimbus 7 SBUV and the NOAA 9 and 11 SBUV/ 2 data to derive a new version 7 data set for each instrument. We have used these data to do a detailed comparison to the Nimbus 7 and Earth Probe TOMS data. Assuming that the D-pair establishes the correct calibration, these comparisons reveal some small calibration drifts (approximately 1 %) in the TOMS data. They also reveal an offset in the D-pair calibration with respect to the Dobson network of approximately 8 Dobson units with the Dobson being lower than the D-pair. The D-pair calibration offsets have been used to create a merged ozone data set from TOMS with a calibration that has been determined independent of the Dobson/Brewer network. Trend analyses of these data will be presented and compared to trend analyses using the ground-based data...|$|R
40|$|This talk {{will discuss}} {{assimilation}} of ozone data from satellite-borne instruments. Satellite observations of ozone total columns and profiles have been {{measured by a}} series of Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (<b>SBUV)</b> <b>instruments,</b> and more recently by the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment. Additional profile data are provided by instruments on NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and by occultation instruments on other platforms. Instruments on Envisat' and future EOS Aura satellite will supply even more comprehensive data about the ozone distribution. Satellite data contain a wealth of information, but they do not provide synoptic global maps of ozone fields. These maps can be obtained through assimilation of satellite data into global chemistry and transport models. In the ozone system at NASA's Data Assimilation Office (DAO) any combination of TOMS, SBUV, and Microwave Limb sounder (MLS) data can be assimilated. We found that the addition of MLS to SBUV and TOMS data in the system helps to constrain the ozone distribution, especially in the polar night region and in the tropics. The assimilated ozone distribution in the troposphere and lower stratosphere is sensitive also to finer changes in the SBUV and TOMS data selection and to changes in error covariance models. All results are established by comparisons of assimilated ozone with independent profiles from ozone sondes and occultation instruments...|$|R

The SBUV ozone profiles are compared with measurements from chemical and optical sensors launched on balloons and rockets and with ozone profiles obtained from the ground-based Dobson spectrophotometers using the Umkehr method. The biases between the SBUV results and the balloon and Umkehr results are generally less than 10 percent. These biases are functions of layer height and latitude and are believed to be largely due to inconsistencies in the ozone absorption cross sections used for the various measurement systems. The precision of the SBUV measurements is found to be better than 8 percent for pressures between 1 and 64 mbar and better than 15 percent from 64 to 253 mbar...|$|E

40|$|The Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Radiometer, Model 2 (SBUV/ 2) instruments, as part {{of their}} regular operation, deploy ground {{aluminum}} reflective diffusers to deflect solar irradiance into the instrument's field-of-view. Previous <b>SBUV</b> <b>instrument</b> diffusers have shown a tendency to degrade in their reflective efficiencies. This degradation will add a trend to the ozone measurements if left uncorrected. An extensive in-flight calibration system was designed into the SBUV/ 2 instruments to effectively measure the degradation of the solar diffuser (Ball Aerospace Systems Division 1981). Soon after launch, the NOAA- 9 SBUV/ 2 calibration system was unable to track the diffuser's reflectivity changes due, in part, to design flows (Frederick et al. 1986). Subsequently, the NOAA- 11 SBUV/ 2 calibration system was redesigned and an analysis of the first 2 years of data (Weiss et al. 1991) indicated the NOAA- 11 SBUV/ 2 onboard calibration system's performance to be exceeding preflight expectations.

40|$|Satellite {{measurements}} {{provide a}} unique global {{view of the}} stratospheric ozone layer. The perspective from satellites allowed for the early mapping {{of the extent of}} the phenomenon that became known as the ozone hole. The use of the satellite data for global trends outside of the ozone hole confronts the problem of the possible drift of the calibration of the instrument. The TOMS and <b>SBUV</b> <b>instruments</b> on Nimbus 7 lasted for more than a decade. During that time, the diffuser plate used to reflect sunlight into the measurement degraded (darkened) and the instruments each had a number of events that made calibration determination difficult. Initially the TOMS data were used for global trends by adjusting the overall calibration to agree with a set of ground-based measurement stations. But this was unsatisfactory because the record was not independent of those ground measurements and problems were found in many of the ground stations by using TOMS as a transfer standard. After many years of dedicated work, the TOMS/SBUV team learned how to correct for instrument drift, remove the interfering effects of aerosols, and establish instrument-to-instrument calibrations resulting in a long-term record {{that can be used for}} accurate trend and recovery determination. The global view of the satellites allows for determination not only of temporal change in ozone, but spatial fingerprints that allow more confidence in assigning cause to observed changes...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the algorithm {{that has been}} applied to develop a 41 yr time series of total ozone and ozone profiles from eight solar-backscatter UV (<b>sbuv)</b> <b>instruments</b> launched on NASA and NOAA satellites since April 1970. Although the basic algorithm is similar to the V 8 algorithm that was released about a decade ago and has been in use since then at NOAA, the details of the V 8 algorithm have never been published. The current version (V 8. 6) incorporates several changes including the use of new ozone absorption cross-sections and new ozone and cloud height climatologies. A particular emphasis in this paper is on characterizing the sources of errors that are relevant for deriving trends from monthly mean anomalies and for estimating biases between different types of ozone sensors. We show that variations in the local time of the measurement due to drifting NOAA satellite orbits can complicate the analysis of trends in the upper stratosphere. Such variations not only increase instrumental and algorithmic uncertainties but also require correction for true local time variations of ozone in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere for trend analysis. We find that the monthly zonal anomalies derived from the SBUV data have high precision, sufficient to track year-to-year changes in ozone over a broad range of altitudes. However, because of poor vertical resolution the data are less well suited to track short-term variability of ozone at lower altitudes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUsing the empirically-corrected {{tropospheric ozone}} {{residual}} (TOR) technique, which utilizes coincident observations of total ozone from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and stratospheric ozone profiles from the Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet (<b>SBUV)</b> <b>instruments,</b> the seasonal and regional distribution of tropospheric ozone across the North Atlantic from 1979 - 2000 is examined. Its {{relationship to the}} North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is also analyzed as a possible transport mechanism across the North Atlantic. Monthly climatologies of tropospheric ozone for five different regions across the North Atlantic exhibit strong seasonality. The correlation between these monthly climatologies of the TOR and ozonesonde profiles at nearby sites in both eastern North America and western Europe are highly significant (R values of + 0. 98 and + 0. 96 respectively) and help to validate the use of satellite retrievals of tropospheric ozone. Distinct springtime interannual variability over North Atlantic Region 5 (eastern North Atlantic-western Europe) is particularly evident and exhibits similar variability to the positive phase of the NAO (R=+ 0. 61, r=< 0. 01). Positive phases of the NAO are indicative of a stronger Bermuda-Azores high and a stronger Icelandic low and thus faster more zonal flow across the North Atlantic from west to east. This flow regime appears to be causing the transport of tropospheric ozone across the North Atlantic and onto Europe. The consequence of such transport is the impact on a downwind region's ability to meet their ozone attainment goals. This link between the positive phase of the NAO and increased tropospheric ozone over Region 5 could be an important tool for prediction of such pollution outbreaks...|$|R

One conclusion to be drawn from the Ozone Trends Panel report is that there are unresolved differences in the ozone profiles measured by different instruments. While the purpose of the work is more to understand the details of the UV radiation field in the stratosphere than it is to assess the accuracy of the SBUV ozone measurement itself, improved understanding of specific problems in the UV will lead to more accurate ozone retrievals. Areas of study include the effect of aerosols on the backscattered albedo, the shape of the ozone profile near the stratopause, the effect of possible polar mesospheric clouds, and the measureability of nitric oxide and sulfur dioxide...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{well-known}} Langley plot technique, used for the calibration of ground-based instruments, has been generalized for application to satellite instruments. In polar regions, near summer solstice, the solar backscattered ultraviolet (<b>SBUV)</b> <b>instrument</b> on the Nimbus 7 satellite samples the same ozone field at widely different solar zenith angles. These measurements are compared to assess the long-term drift in the instrument calibration. Although the technique provides only a relative wavelength-to-wavelength calibration, it can be combined with existing techniques to determine the drift of the instrument at any wavelength. Using this technique, we have generated a 12 -year data set of ozone vertical profiles from SBUV with an estimated accuracy of +/- 5 % at 1 mbar and +/- 2 % at 10 mbar (95 % confidence) over 12 years. Since the method is insensitive to true changes in the atmospheric ozone profile, {{it can also be}} used to compare the calibrations of similar SBUV instruments launched without temporal overlap...|$|E

The assimilated data base combines satellite-based ozone measurements from 4 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments, 3 different retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), and data from 4 Solar Backscatter Ultra-Violet (<b>SBUV)</b> <b>instruments.</b> Comparisons with the global ground-based Dobson spectrophotometer network are used to remove offsets and drifts between the different data sets to produce a global homogeneous data set that combines the advantages of good spatial coverage of satellite data with good long-term stability of ground-based measurements. One potential use of the derived indices is detection of the expected recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole. The suitability of the derived indicators to this task is discussed {{in the context of their}} variability and their susceptibility to saturation effects which makes them less responsive to decreasing stratospheric halogen loading. It is also shown that if the corrections required to match recent Earth Probe TOMS measurements to Dobson measurements are not applied, some of the indictors are affected so as to obscure detection of the recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole...|$|R
40|$|The Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Radiometer (<b>SBUV)</b> <b>instruments</b> on NASA and NOAA {{spacecraft}} {{provide a}} long-term record of total-column ozone and deep-layer partial columns since about 1980. These data have been carefully processed to extract long-term trends {{and offer a}} valuable resource for ozone monitoring. Studies assimilating limb-sounding observations in the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) data assimilation system (DAS) demonstrate that vertical ozone gradients in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) are much better represented than with the deep-layer SBUV observations. This is exemplified {{by the use of}} retrieved ozone from the EOS Microwave Limb Sounder (EOS-MLS) instrument in the MERRA- 2 reanalysis, for the period after 2004. This study examines the potential for extending the use of limb-sounding observations at earlier times and into the future, so that future reanalyses may be more applicable to the study of long-term ozone changes. Historical data are available from NASA instruments: the Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere (LIMS: 1978 - 1979); the Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite (UARS: 1991 - 1995); Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER: 2000 -onwards). For the post EOS-MLS period, the joint NASA-NOAA Ozone Monitoring and Profiling Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP) instrument was launched on the Suomi-NPP platform in 201 x and is planned for future platforms. This study will examine two aspects of these data pertaining to future reanalyses. First, the feasibility of merging the EOS-MLS and OMPS-LP instruments to provide a long-term record that extends beyond the potential lifetime of EOS-MLS. If feasible, this would allow for long-term monitoring of ozone recovery in a three-dimensional reanalysis context. Second, the skill of the GEOS DAS in ingesting historical data types will be investigated. Because these do not overlap with EOS-MLS, use will be made of system statistics and evaluation using independent datasets. Impacts of using a complete ozone chemistry module will also be considered...|$|R
40|$|The assimilated ozone {{product from}} the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA- 2), {{produced}} at NASAs Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) is summarized. The reanalysis begins in 1980 {{with the use}} of retrieved partial-column ozone concentrations from a series of Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Radiometer (<b>SBUV)</b> <b>instruments</b> on NASA and NOAA spacecraft. Beginning in October 2004, retrieved ozone profiles from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and total column ozone from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASAs EOS Aura satellite are assimilated. While this change in data streams does lead to a discontinuity in the assimilated ozone fields in MERRA- 2, making it not useful for studies in decadal (secular) trends in ozone, this choice was made to prioritize demonstrating the value NASAs high-quality research data in the reanalysis context. The MERRA- 2 ozone is compared with independent satellite and ozonesonde data, focusing on the representation of the spatial and temporal variability of stratospheric and upper-tropospheric ozone. The comparisons show agreement within 10 (standard deviation of the difference) between MERRA- 2 profiles and independent satellite data in most of the stratosphere. The agreement improves after 2004, when EOS Aura data are assimilated. The standard deviation {{of the differences between the}} lower-stratospheric and upper-tropospheric MERRA- 2 ozone and ozonesondes is 11. 2 and 24. 5, respectively, with correlations of 0. 8 and above. This is indicative of a realistic representation of the UTLS ozone variability in MERRA- 2. After 2004, the upper tropospheric ozone in MERRA- 2 shows a low bias compared to the sondes, but the covariance with independent observations is improved compared to earlier years. Case studies demonstrate the integrity of MERRA- 2 analyses in representing important features such as tropopause folds...|$|R
