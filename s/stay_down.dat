5|$|In November 2005 the Smoking Popes, with drummer Rob Kellenberger, reunited to play Chicago's Flower 15 festival. The {{performance}} was recorded and released as the CD/DVD package At Metro through Victory Records in February 2006. Ryan Chavez drummed on the band's fifth studio album, <b>Stay</b> <b>Down,</b> released in 2008 through Curb Appeal Records. Neil Hennessy of fellow Chicago punk rock band The Lawrence Arms became the Smoking Popes' permanent drummer {{prior to the}} album's release. In February 2010 Asian Man Records released the compilation album It's Been a Long Day. The band's sixth studio album, This Is Only a Test, was released March 15, 2011 through Asian Man.|$|E
5|$|The September 2014 tour {{comprised}} thirteen American dates, all {{in western}} and central states. At various shows, the Funs, the Neptunas, and Kelley Stoltz were the opening acts. The tour began in early September with dates in St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri, and then continued west to Denver, Salt Lake City, and Garden City. On September 10, the Breeders started a short Pacific Coast stretch, performing in Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco. These {{were followed by}} the inland cities Las Vegas and Phoenix, then west again to San Diego, leading up to their concert on September 18 at the Hollywood Bowl with Neutral Milk Hotel and Daniel Johnston. Following the Hollywood concert, the Breeders finished their tour at the Goose Island 312 Urban Block Dance Party event in Chicago on September 20, with groups such as Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Thao & the Get Down <b>Stay</b> <b>Down.</b>|$|E
5|$|Allison was {{replaced}} as manager by Terry Venables, {{who had been}} his assistant the previous season, and he guided Palace to promotion at the first attempt. The Palace youngsters also won the FA Youth Cup with a side including Kenny Sansom, Vince Hilaire and Billy Gilbert. The following season, 1977–78 saw the youth team became {{the first team to}} win the FA Youth Cup in successive seasons since Chelsea in 1960 and 1961. These talented young players had become regulars in the team by the 1978–79 season which saw Palace vying not only for promotion but also the Second Division Championship. The final game of the season was a Friday night match at home to Burnley. In front of the club's record home crowd of 51,801, there was all to play for: a Palace win, and the club would be champions; a draw, and Palace would be promoted, but hand the championship to fierce rivals Brighton; a loss and Palace would <b>stay</b> <b>down,</b> with Sunderland clinching the final promotion place. At half-time the deadlock had not been broken despite Palace's dominance, but a second-half cross from Vince Hilaire allowed Ian Walsh to head the opener, before a great run by David Swindlehurst was completed by a finish from outside the penalty area to give the Eagles a 2–0 win. Palace were crowned champions, and had reached the top flight again.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} match, Cesaro {{defeated}} Sami Zayn. In {{the first half}} of the match, Zayn dove through the ropes looking for a tornado DDT, only for Cesaro to intercept with a European uppercut. Cesaro went on to target Zayn's left knee. In the second half of the match, Cesaro attempted to superplex Zayn from the apron into the ring, but Zayn countered and tried to perform a frankensteiner to Cesaro. Cesaro countered to try a superbomb, but Zayn reversed to successfully perform the frankensteiner. Zayn then hit his signature Helluva Kick to Cesaro, but Cesaro kicked out of the resulting pin. Cesaro then repeatedly implored Zayn to <b>stay</b> <b>down,</b> but Zayn kept getting up to receive more European uppercuts. Cesaro attempted his signature Neutralizer, but Zayn countered and went on to hit a sunset flip powerbomb, but it was not enough to win the match. Cesaro then hit a European uppercut after throwing Zayn into the air, but Zayn kicked out of a pin at one. Cesaro hit a discus European uppercut and then performed the Neutralizer on Zayn for the victory. After the match, Cesaro hugged Zayn.|$|E
5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, {{the more likely it}} is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads <b>stay</b> <b>down.</b> Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E
25|$|Surface-supplied divers may be {{required}} to work in mid-water or on the bottom. They must be able to <b>stay</b> <b>down</b> without effort, and this usually requires weighting. When working in mid-water the diver may wish to be neutrally buoyant or negative, and when working on the bottom he will usually want to be several kilos negative.|$|E

25|$|Herrera {{turned his}} prisoners over to men in his squad, then started {{crawling}} {{toward the other}} machine gun, firing as he went. (“My M-1 was talking, and the Germans understood what it was saying,” he commented later.) The position was protected by a minefield; GIs were throwing rocks into the area {{in an effort to}} explode the mines. Herrera got up and charged the Germans anyway, but as he neared the machine-gun nest, he stepped on a mine. He was thrown to the ground, both of his feet blown off at the ankle. Though bleeding heavily, he lay on his stomach and fired at the Germans, forcing them to <b>stay</b> <b>down</b> and thus enabling his squad to skirt the minefield, flank the enemy, and move in for the kill.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2013, Target Field {{has hosted}} every summer the Skyline Music Festival, named so because its seating, {{with only the}} seats around third base in an Amphitheatre-like manner, allows for {{extensive}} views of the Minneapolis skyline. The inaugural edition was held on July 26, 2013, featuring three of four bands in a package tour – Soul Asylum, Matthew Sweet and Big Head Todd and the Monsters, each of whom played one of their past albums in their entirety – along with Minnesota band Gear Daddies. The 6,752 tickets allowed by the section were sold out. The following edition was extended to two nights. August 8 featured an indie rock night sponsored by KCMP, featuring Andrew Bird, The New Pornographers, Thao and the Get Down <b>Stay</b> <b>Down,</b> S. Carey and Dosh. The following night was headlined by Melissa Etheridge, accompanied by the returning Gear Daddies, along with The Honeydogs, O.A.R. and The Rembrandts. Attendance was 2,500 for the first night and 5,500 for the second.|$|E
25|$|In a closed-circuit rebreather {{the oxygen}} partial {{pressure}} in the rebreather is controlled, {{so it can be}} maintained at a safe continuous maximum, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial {{pressure in the}} breathing loop. Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation. This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real-time computer processing by the diver's decompression computer. Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and, as a result, divers can <b>stay</b> <b>down</b> longer or require less time to decompress. A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas mixture into the breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen {{at any time during the}} dive depends on the diver's oxygen consumption and/or breathing rate. Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems.|$|E

500|$|Many reviews {{criticized the}} Andy-Erin plot. White wrote that, [...] "If the Andy and Erin scenes in this episode were {{supposed}} to make me root for them, I'm afraid it didn't quite work." [...] Dougherty wrote, [...] "Was anyone else rooting for Erin to just <b>stay</b> <b>down</b> there? I certainly was." [...] McNutt bluntly wrote, [...] "I'm not buying this relationship." [...] The WHTC review noted that the arc was [...] "a total carbon copy of the Jim/Pam version that sucked us all in years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Doctor's Wife" [...] {{was planned}} {{as the third}} episode in the 2011 series but the order was changed during the {{production}} process. Initial production occurred in September, with Gaiman visiting the set during the production period and filming for the associated Confidential. Additional filming took place in October 2010, with guest star Suranne Jones having been filmed for green screen special effects. The scenes where Amy and Rory are on the run allowed the audience to explore the TARDIS outside the control room, something the producers had wanted {{to do for a}} while. A series of corridors was constructed and retained for future use. The episode also featured the return of the older TARDIS control room from the Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant era. Gaiman had originally wanted to reconstruct a console room from the original series, but the cost proved prohibitive. The set was retained after filming for [...] "The Eleventh Hour", but has since been removed {{to become part of the}} Doctor Who Experience exhibit. Arthur Darvill noted the floor of the older set had a cheese grater-like quality to it, so when the scene called for the cast to fall on it, they found it uncomfortable to <b>stay</b> <b>down</b> for a long period of time.|$|E
500|$|Early in May, Dodd {{continued}} to campaign in California {{for a few}} days but later shifted back to the strategically important states of Iowa and New Hampshire {{for the rest of the}} month. On May 15 the campaign released its first ad, which detailed his plan for ending the war in Iraq. In the ad, Dodd also criticized his fellow Democratic candidates by stating, [...] "We can't simply wait for a new president. We should have the conviction to stand up to this one," [...] In Washington, Dodd was exposed to debate on the Iraq War Spending Bill and new videos from al-Qaeda's second in command Ayman al-Zawahiri. Back on the campaign trail he talked about how he would deal with foreign issues particularly in regards to the situation in Iraq, [...] "I'm not going to let my foreign policy be decided by Mr. al-Zawahiri. Obviously, he's playing his game here. He'd probably like to see us <b>stay</b> <b>down</b> there, bogged down, at the costs we're increasing here, the loss of lives, not to mention the isolation of the United States." [...] When Presidential candidate John Edwards released an ad criticizing Congress' failure to end the Iraq War, Dodd took it personal and shot back at Edwards stating, [...] ""With all due respect, we could have used John's vote here in the Senate on these issues here." [...] He concluded the May campaign by attending House parties in three cities in New Hampshire[...]|$|E

2500|$|The Israelis {{sprang from}} their {{vehicles}} and burst towards the terminal. The hostages {{were in the}} main hall of the airport building, directly adjacent to the runway. Entering the terminal, the commandos shouted through a megaphone, [...] "Stay down! <b>Stay</b> <b>down!</b> We are Israeli soldiers," [...] in both Hebrew and English. Jean-Jacques Maimoni, a 19-year-old French immigrant to Israel, stood up and was killed when Israeli company commander Muki Betzer and another soldier mistook him for a hijacker and fired at him. Another hostage, Pasco Cohen, 52, a region manager at the Meuhedet health fund, was also fatally wounded by gunfire from the commandos. In addition, a third hostage, 56-year-old Ida Borochovitch, a Russian Jew who had emigrated to Israel, {{was killed by a}} hijacker in the crossfire.|$|E
2500|$|Mozart also {{supervised}} the Vienna {{premiere of the}} work, which took place on 7 May 1788.

2500|$|Female {{elephant}} seals forage in {{the open}} ocean, while male elephant seals forage along the continental shelf. [...] Males usually dive straight down to the ocean floor and stay at the bottom foraging for benthic prey. [...] The females hunt for pelagic prey {{in the open}} ocean, and dive deeper (up to 1000 m) and <b>stay</b> <b>down</b> longer than the males. [...] Northern elephant seals eat a variety of prey, including pelagic, deep-water squid, Pacific hake, pelagic crustaceans, sharks, rays, and ratfish. Octopoteuthis deletron squid are a common prey item, one study found this species in the stomachs of 58% of individuals sampled {{off the coast of}} California. A female northern elephant seal was documented in 2013 by a deep sea camera at a depth of , where it consumed a Pacific hagfish, slurping it up from the ocean floor. The event was reported by a Ukrainian boy named Kirill Dudko, who further reported the find to scientists in Canada. Elephant seals do not need to drink, as they get their water from food and metabolism of fats.|$|E

2500|$|Wrestling fans {{consider}} this show {{to be the}} beginning of the end for WCW, however, even as they were dominating the WWF in the television ratings. Hogan was heavily criticized for not doing a clean finish to the match, which confused and irritated fans who had waited over a year to see Sting take down the nWo. The finish actually involved a recently introduced Bret Hart, who had refereed the preceding match between Bischoff and Larry Zbyszko for control of Nitro, coming down to the ring after Hogan had supposedly won the match. Hart alleged that referee Nick Patrick had performed a fast count on Sting and wanted to [...] "make things right". By many accounts, however, including Eric Bischoff's in Controversy Creates Cash, the count looked like a normal count, so Hart's protestations did not make sense. Television replays of the three-count on later shows had the video sped up to hide this. Hurting the argument the most was the fact that Sting never tried to kick out while Hogan pinned him, proving even if the count was normal the pin would have happened regardless. Hart insisted that the match continue with himself as referee, in order to prevent Sting from being [...] "screwed" [...] like Hart had legitimately been at the Montreal Screwjob, which had soured his ties with the WWF and hastened his leave to WCW. In essence, whereas fans were promised a classic battle between Hogan and Sting in which the latter would defeat the leader of the nWo, they were presented with a faux reverse-tide potshot at the Montreal Screwjob. The inclusion of Hart himself confused and frustrated fans even more as Hart had no part in the feud between Hogan and Sting. However, the most harming fact of the match to the fans was watching Sting <b>stay</b> <b>down</b> for a full count of three to Hogan when he was built up as the one man to end the nWo, thereby hurting their impression of him. To add insult to injury, it was decided that because of the messy finish to the rematch (on the following Monday's Nitro show which ended with Hogan, and then Sting regaining the title in the same match), Sting had to be stripped of the WCW title that he won from Hogan on January 8, 1998 at the debut episode of WCW Thunder. It was announced when Sting was stripped on television that they would face each other again for the vacant championship at WCW SuperBrawl VIII the next month ...|$|E
