A comprehensive characterization of the fruit fly based on genetic studies and compatibility analysis was undertaken on two founder populations from the provinces of Buenos Aires and Mendoza, used in pioneering sterile male technique control programmes in our country. The locations are 1, 000 km apart from each other. Methodology/Principal Findings: We compared the genetic composition of both populations based on cytological, physiological and morphological characterization. Compatibility studies were performed {{in order to determine the}} presence of isolation barriers. Results indicate that the Buenos Aires germplasm described previously is partially different from that of the Mendoza population. Both laboratory colonies are a reservoir of mutational and cytological polymorphisms. Some <b>sexual</b> <b>chromosome</b> variants such as the XL and the YL resulting from attachment of a B-chromosome to the X-chromosome or Y-chromosome behave as a lethal sex-linked factor.

40|$|Now {{there are}} three ways to select {{the sex of the}} fetus before {{implantation}} (1, 2). Two of these methods are scientifically proven that are used in the fertility and infertility centers (3). Two types of pre implantation methods (PGD and Ericsson method) used for social sex selection. Both of them are based on actively rendering the second sex chromosome to be either a Y chromosome (resulting in a male), or an X chromosome (resulting in a female). Another way to determine the sex of an embryo before implantation is called PGD (pre implantation genetic diagnosis). In this procedure, after ovarian stimulation multiple oocytes are removed from the mother. The eggs are fertilized in the laboratory using the father's sperm in a technique called in vitro fertilization (IVF). As the embryos develop through cleavage, a blastomere is removed from each embryo and then assessed for the presence of Y and X chromosome and separated by <b>sexual</b> <b>chromosome.</b> Embryos of the desired gender are transferred back in the mother's uterus (4). There are two ways to select the sperm sex; Micro Sort and Ericsson method (5, 6). In this way the sperm that contain the desired sex chromosome can be selected and used for fertilization of female gametes. In Ericsson as sperm passes through albumin gradient, the differences in mass between the X and Y chromosomes cause the females dragged down by the weight of the extra "leg " of the X sex chromosome. The method has a 70 - 72 % success rate for boys and a 69 - 75 % success rate for girls (2). The third method is the determination of sperm sex chromosomes in sperm sorting by flow cytometry.

In this study, we analyzed genotypes of 438 males for a set of 284 643 SNP from this high density chip to characterize the LD pattern in abrown layer population. LD was measured by the average r 2 value at a given physical distance. Genome wide, themean value of r 2 observed in pair-wise distances of < 25 Kb is 0. 5 and it decreased to 0. 32 at adistance of 120 to 200 kb. Across autosomal chromosomes, it varied between 0. 38 and 0. 60 ata distance < 25 kb and between 0. 16 and 0. 44 at a distance of 120 to 200 kb. Most differencesappeared between macrochromosomes, intermediates, microchromosomes and Z sexualchromosome.

40|$|Abstract Background An {{increasing}} number of foetuses are recognized as having double Y because of {{the widespread use of}} prenatal screening using chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis. 47, XYY karyotype occurs in about one out of 1, 000 newborn males, but it is not often detected unless it is diagnosed during prenatal testing. Despite the fact that unbiased follow-up studies demonstrate largely normal post-natal development of young men with 47, XYY, there is a scarcity of controlled studies about the neurological, cognitive and behavioural phenotype which remains the main reason for anxiety and anticipatory negative attitudes of parents. Furthermore, prejudices still exist among professionals and the general population concerning the relationship between this sex chromosome aneuploidy and aggressive and antisocial behaviours. Methods We report on the clinical follow-up of children diagnosed prenatally with a 47,XYY karyotype, whose parents received multidisciplinary counselling and support at time of diagnosis. The specific focus of our study is on auxology, facial features, developmental milestones, behaviour, detection of aggressiveness as well as the evaluation of parental attitudes toward prenatal counselling. Clinical evaluations including auxological measurements and dysmorphological descriptions were as conducted on 13 boys aged 9 month - 7 years. The Child Behavior Check List test specific for age and a 15 item questionnaire were administered to both parents. An update of ongoing problems was carried out by means of a telephone interview two years later. Results Our results show that, from birth, weight, height and head circumference were above average values while some facial features such mild hypertelorism are overrepresented when compared to parents' facial features. Language delay was detected in 8 out of 11 children older than 20 months. Parental attitudes were found to be favourable toward prenatal diagnoses of <b>sexual</b> <b>chromosome</b> aneuploidies. Conclusions Our data, although limited, is similar to other observational studies, and serves to alert clinicians about opportunities to delineate new and appropriate educational interventions that target the specific learning challenges of XYY boys.

The aim of this study is to verify whether, increasing the number of autosomal STRs analyzed, the application of PES allows to achieve an acceptable value of paternity probability without availability of parents’ profiles...|$|R
40|$|Cell fusion plays a well-recognized {{physiological}} role during development, {{while its}} function during progression is still unclear. Here, {{we show that}} acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells spontaneously fused with murine host cells in vivo. AML cells fused in most cases with mouse macrophages. Other targets of AML cell fusion were dendritic and endothelial cells. Cytogenetic and molecular analysis revealed that successive recipients conserved detectable amounts of parental DNA. Moreover, in a mouse AML 1 -ETO model where female AML 1 -ETO-leukemic cells, expressing CD 45. 2, were injected in congenic CD 45. 1 male mice AML cells, we found hybrid cells expressing both allelic types of CD 45 and XXY set of <b>sexual</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> More importantly, the fusion protein AML 1 -ETO was transferred in the hybrid cells. When sorted hybrid cells were reinjected in a secondary recipient, they gave rise to leukemia with 100 % penetrance and similar time of onset of leukemic cells. Our data indicate that in vivo fusion of cancer cells with host cells may be a mechanism of gene transfer for cancer dissemination and suggest that fused cells {{may be used to}} identify still unrecognized leukemogenic genes that are conserved in hybrid cells and able to perpetuate leukemia in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Deficient {{paternity}} cases, {{where the}} DNA {{profile of the}} alleged father is not available, are not unusual in forensic practice. Considerably larger sets of genetic markers have to be examined than in standard casework and the statistical evaluation of the DNA evidence is more difficult. Such a case can also be burdened with danger of false inclusion. The reported case of disputed paternity has recently come at our attention. The claimant pretended to be the natural daughter of a long-time deceased man, who had three legitimate children, two sons and one daughter. Initially, genetic profiles were obtained from three subjects: the claimant, the alleged father’s daughter and one alleged father’s son. The results for a 20 STRs loci profile revealed only one exclusion between the claimant and the siblings. Also the analysis of X chromosome polymorphisms revealed one exclusion. Only by typing for 20 STRs loci also the other son the combined results revealed five exclusions. In cases when the request is to verify the relationship between two half-siblings of different gender {{in the absence of}} data from parents, when <b>sexual</b> <b>chromosomes</b> polymorphisms are not useful, the only possible approach is {{to increase the number of}} analyzed autosomal STRs and include in the analysis the most number of parents as possible...|$|R
