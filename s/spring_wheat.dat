Vitamin B concentration of ten <b>spring</b> <b>wheats</b> was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Different fermentation techniques (short, long and sourdough fermentation) were applied for bread preparation. Effect of these fermentation techniques on level of B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and pyridoxine) was also examined by HPLC and the products were evaluated for their sensory characteristics. The resultant data were subjected to statistical analysis to check the level of significance through software Statistics 8. 1.

25|$|Plants acquire CO2 {{and produce}} organic {{compounds}} {{with the use}} of one of three photosynthetic pathways. The two most prevalent pathways are the C3 and C4 processes. C3 plants are best adapted to cool and wet conditions while C4 plants do well in hot and dry ecosystems. Due to the different photosynthetic enzymes between the two pathways, different carbon isotopes are acquired preferentially. Isotopes are the same element that differ in the number of neutrons, thereby making one isotope heavier than the other. The two stable carbon isotopes are 12C and 13C. The C3 pathway will discriminate against the heavier isotope more than the C4 pathway. This will make the plant structures produced from C4 plants more enriched in the heavier isotope and therefore root exudates and litter from these plants will also be more enriched. When the carbon in these structures is respired, the CO2 will show a similar ratio of the two isotopes. Researchers will grow a C4 plant on soil that was previously occupied by a C3 plant or vice versa. By taking soil respiration measurements and analyzing the isotopic ratios of the CO2 it can be determined whether the soil respiration is mostly old versus recently formed carbon. For example, maize, a C4 plant, was grown on soil where <b>spring</b> <b>wheat,</b> a C3 plant, was previously grown. The results showed respiration of C3 SOM in the first 40 days, with a gradual linear increase in heavy isotope enrichment until day 70. The days after 70 showed a slowing enrichment to a peak at day 100. By analyzing stable carbon isotope data it is possible to determine the source components of respired SOM that was produced by different photosynthetic pathways.|$|E

500|$|A {{father of}} modern milling in America {{and founder of}} what became General Mills, Cadwallader C. Washburn {{converted}} his business from gristmills to truly revolutionary technology, including [...] "gradual reduction" [...] processing by steel and porcelain roller mills capable of producing premium-quality pure white flour very quickly. Some ideas were developed by William Dixon Gray and some acquired through industrial espionage from the Hungarians by William de la Barre. Charles A. Pillsbury and C.A. Pillsbury Company across the river were barely a step behind, hiring Washburn employees to immediately use the new methods. The hard red <b>spring</b> <b>wheat</b> that grows in Minnesota became valuable ($.50 profit per barrel in 1871 increased to $4.50 in 1874), and Minnesota [...] "patent" [...] flour was recognized {{at the time as}} the best in the world.|$|E
500|$|The St. Anthony Express {{newspaper}} {{predicted in}} 1855 that, [...] "The {{time is not}} distant when Minnesota, with the superiority of her soil and seasons for wheat culture, and her unparalleled water power for manufacturing flour, will export largely of this article. ... our mills will turn out wheat, superior in quality and appearance to any now manufactured in the West." [...] By 1876, eighteen flour mills had been built {{on the west side}} of the river below the falls. The first mills used traditional technology of millstones that would pulverize the grain and grind as much flour as possible in one pass. This system worked best for winter wheat, which was sown in the fall and resumed its growth in the spring. However, the harsh winter conditions of the upper Midwest did not lend themselves to the production of winter wheat, since the deep frosts and lack of snow cover killed the crop. <b>Spring</b> <b>wheat,</b> which could be sown in the spring and reaped in the summer, was a more dependable crop. However, conventional milling techniques did not produce a desirable product, since the harder husks of <b>spring</b> <b>wheat</b> kernels fractured between the grindstones. The gluten and starch in the flour could not be mixed completely, either, and the flour would turn rancid. Minneapolis milling companies solved this problem by inventing the middlings purifier, which made it possible to separate the husks from the flour earlier in the milling process. They also developed a gradual-reduction process, where grain was pulverized between a series of rollers made of porcelain, iron, or steel. This process resulted in [...] "patent" [...] flour, which commanded almost double the price of [...] "bakers" [...] or [...] "clear" [...] flour, which it replaced. The Washburn mill attempted to monopolize these techniques, but Pillsbury and other companies lured employees away from Washburn and were able to duplicate the process.|$|E

Growth habit and earliness from fall seeding appeared to have very little relation, indicating that two types of earliness exist: one affecting earliness of heading from fall seeding and the other the expression of growth habit. Each parent seemed to carry factors for both types of earliness. The presence of very early spring lines, hardy lines, and late tender lines indicates that with large populations many types of individuals are possible as far as these characters are concerned.
