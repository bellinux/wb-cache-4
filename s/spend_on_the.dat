5|$|The {{player can}} level up their Warden {{character}} by earning experience points through completing quests and defeating enemies. Each time the player levels up, they receive three points to <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> character's six attributes. Strength inflicts more damage, dexterity helps evade attacks more often, willpower increases stamina, magic increases spell damage or magic defense, cunning improves combat tactics, and constitution helps withstand attacks. Special skills, which {{are divided into}} four different aspects for each class, and specialization options, which offer class-specific skills, can also be unlocked by levelling up.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, {{there have}} been various small controversies, the most infamous being the scandal {{involving}} the Steinmetz High School team, which was caught cheating at the 1995 Illinois state finals. This event was later dramatized in the 2000 film Cheaters. Academic Decathlon has been criticized by educators {{for the amount of}} time it requires students to <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> material, as it constitutes an entire curriculum beyond the one provided by the school. Around the turn of the millennium, several coaches protested the USAD's decision to publish error-ridden Resource Guides rather than provide topics for students to research.|$|E

25|$|While 18 million {{children}} {{work on the}} streets of India, it is estimated that only 5–20 percent of them are truly homeless and disconnected from their families.

As the most vulnerable group of children in India according to UNICEF, they need to be understood as much as possible.|$|E
25|$|A {{larger number}} of modern species {{intermittently}} or briefly use a bipedal gait. Several lizard species move bipedally when running, usually to escape from threats. Many primate and bear species will adopt a bipedal gait {{in order to reach}} food or explore their environment. Several arboreal primate species, such as gibbons and indriids, exclusively walk on two legs during the brief periods they <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Many animals rear up on their hind legs whilst fighting or copulating. Some animals commonly stand on their hind legs, in order to reach food, to keep watch, to threaten a competitor or predator, or to pose in courtship, but do not move bipedally.|$|E
25|$|Ministers {{increased}} {{the amount of}} money that parties and candidates were allowed to <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> election by 23%, a move decided against Electoral Commission advice. The election saw the first cap on spending by parties in individual constituencies during the 100 days before Parliament's dissolution on 30 March: £30,700, plus a per-voter allowance of 9p in county constituencies and 6p in borough seats. An additional voter allowance of more than £8,700 is available after the dissolution of Parliament. UK political parties spent £31.1m in the 2010 general election, of which the Conservative Party spent 53%, the Labour Party spent 25% and the Liberal Democrats 15%.|$|E

25|$|The Sierra Club {{criticized the}} capital {{projects}} as adding to urban sprawl while hurting air quality. In response, {{the expense of}} implementing Open Road Tolling has justified by claiming it significantly decreases the amount of pollution from vehicle exhaust that enters the air. This is because the old barrier style tollbooths adds {{to the amount of}} time that certain vehicles <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roadway by requiring them to slow down, stop, and sometimes idle for several minutes while waiting to pay their tolls. The introduction of the I-Pass system has greatly alleviated this problem since all vehicles with an I-Pass or E-Zpass can continue to travel at normal highway speeds through the toll plazas.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, character stats are preset, with the player able to choose from three race/class combinations; a dwarven fighter (Kromlech), a human archer (Vahn) or an elven sorceress (Adrianna). The player can customize their character's stats through gaining experience points from defeating enemies. Every time the character increases in level, points are awarded corresponding to that level; i.e. if a character increases to level twelve, the player will gain twelve experience points to <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> character's spells and feats. For every four levels which the character increases, the player is given one ability point to spend on one of the six core attributes (strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, charisma).|$|E
25|$|The band {{decided to}} record its next album {{without the help}} of a label, {{supporting}} itself with touring and by compiling its previously released singles into Singles, which was released on indie label Big Wheel Recreation. The band also took on day jobs, saving {{as much as they could}} to <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sessions. The band worked for a third time with Trombino, who agreed to defer payment until after the album's release in order to keep costs down. Some of the drum tracks were recorded at Cherokee, and then the band moved to Doug Messenger's harddrive analog and digital in North Hollywood, where five weeks of tracking completed the recording phase. Trombino then mixed the record at Extasy in Hollywood.|$|E

The Scottish Government does however have control over Economic Development policy, and controls, funds and regulates the national Economic development Agency – Scottish Enterprise.

500|$|Whannell and Wan {{initially}} had $30,000 to <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> film, but as {{the script}} developed {{it was clear that}} more funds would be needed. The script was optioned by a producer in Sydney for a year but the deal eventually fell through. After other failed attempts to get the script produced in Australia from 2001 to 2002, literary agent Ken Greenblat read the script and suggested they travel to Los Angeles, where their chances of finding an interested studio were greater. Wan and Whannell initially refused, due to lack of traveling funds but the pair's agent, Stacey Testro, convinced them to go. [...] In order to help studios take interest in the script, Whannell provided A$5,000 (US$5,000) to make a seven-minute short film based on the script's jaw trap scene, which they thought would prove most effective. Whannell played David, the man wearing the Reverse Bear Trap. Working at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Whannell and Wan knew cameramen who were willing to provide technical assistance for the short.|$|E
