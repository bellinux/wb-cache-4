Keep your lantern well up <b>so's</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> things ahead of you good. I'm going to march in on Noakes--and take him--and jug the other chaps.

"You squealed {{fairly well}} for a fellow who was so badly done up," [...] Mr. Sweet said, with a laugh, as he {{proceeded}} to dress the barker's wounded nose, [...] "and I reckon you'll be all right by morning. Light {{some of the other}} lanterns <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> what I'm about, and during the remainder of the night we'll stand guard, for no one can say how soon those scoundrels may attempt to pay us a second visit, although I think they had a full dose this time." ...|$|E
6000|$|I don't {{think it}} odd that I should look careworn. I {{have enough to}} make me so! And yet if I were with you now, brightened up by being with you, you would say, [...] "How well he looks!" [...] And you would think I had any amount of work in me, as you saw me riding or walking or holding services. And then I had to a very {{considerable}} extent got over that silly shyness, which was a great trial and drawback to me of old, and sadly prevented me from enjoying the society of people (at Oxford especially) which would have done me much good.

How do I know that, but for my unfortunate presence, you, and—and—the {{rest of that}} former party, our engaging guardian excepted, might be dining cheerfully in Minor Canon Corner to-morrow? Indeed it probably would be <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> too well that I am not high in the old lady’s opinion, and {{it is easy to}} understand what an irksome clog I must be upon the hospitalities of her orderly house—especially at this time of year—when I must be kept asunder from this person, and there is such a reason for my not being brought into contact with that person, and an unfavourable reputation has preceded me with such another person; and so on. I have put this very gently to Mr. Crisparkle, for you know his self-denying ways; but still I have put it. What I have laid much greater stress upon at the same time is, that I am engaged in a miserable struggle with myself, and that a little change and absence may enable me to come through it the better. So, the weather being bright and hard, I am going on a walking expedition, and intend taking myself out of everybody’s way (my own included, I hope) to-morrow morning.’ ...|$|E
60|$|This {{human mind}} wrote history, and this must read it. The Sphinx must solve her own riddle. If {{the whole of}} history is in one man, it is all to be {{explained}} from individual experience. There is a relation between the hours of our life and the centuries of time. As the air I breathe is drawn from the great repositories of nature, as the light on my book is yielded by a star a hundred millions of miles distant, as the poise of my body depends on the equilibrium of centrifugal and centripetal forces, so the hours should be instructed by the ages and the ages explained by the hours. Of the universal mind each individual man is one more incarnation. All its properties consist in him. Each new fact in his private experience flashes a light on what great bodies of men have done, and the crises of his life refer to national crises. Every revolution was first a thought in one man's mind, and when the same thought occurs to another man, it {{is the key to}} that era. Every reform was once a private opinion, and when it shall be a private opinion again it will solve the problem of the age. The fact narrated must correspond to something in me to be credible or intelligible. We, as we read, must become Greeks, Romans, Turks, priest and king, martyr and executioner; must fasten these images to some reality in our secret experience, or we shall learn nothing rightly. What befell Asdrubal or Caesar Borgia is as much an illustration of the mind's powers and depravations as what has befallen us. Each new law and political movement has meaning for you. Stand before each of its tablets and say, 'Under this mask did my Proteus nature hide itself.' This remedies the defect of our too great nearness to ourselves. This throws our actions into perspective; and as crabs, goats, scorpions, the balance and the waterpot lose their meanness when hung as signs in the zodiac, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> my own vices without heat in the distant persons of Solomon, Alcibiades, and Catiline.|$|E

5000|$|According to Alan Cooper, [...] "Sarstedt {{insisted it}} was not written with actress Sophia Loren in mind. 'Yes, it's a {{portrait}} of a poor-born girl who becomes a member of the European jet-set. And yes, there's reference to her growing up on the 'back streets of Naples', <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> why people may think it was written with Sophia Loren in mind. But that's just a coincidence. I really wasn't thinking of anyone specific.'" ...|$|E

50|$|Justice Jackson dissented {{because he}} {{believed}} that the First Amendment foreclosed inquiry into both the truthfulness of the defendants' religious claims and their sincerity. He would have dismissed the case entirely for being too close to a religious persecution: I should say the defendants have done just that for which they are indicted. If I might agree to their conviction without creating a precedent, I cheerfully would do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> in their teachings nothing but humbug, untainted by any trace of truth.

There's no motive, Mr. Holmes. That's what bothers me--I can't put my hand on a motive.

5000|$|From {{being in}} the {{perspective}} of the Apache helicopter crew, I can see where a group of men gathering, when there's a firefight just a few blocks away, which I was involved in, and they’re carrying weapons, one of which is an RPG. ... Their overall mission that day was to protect us, to provide support for us, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> where the initial attack on the group of men was warranted. However, personally I don’t feel that the attack on the van was warranted. I think that the people could have been deterred from doing what they were doing in the van by simply firing a few warning shots versus completely obliterating the van and its occupants.|$|E
5000|$|Internal rhyme is used {{extensively}} in rap/hip hop music, where it sometimes overlaps with assonance. The usage of internal rhyme in rap has increased over time, {{but can be}} found even in the earliest rap songs, such as the Sugarhill Gangs 1979 single, Rappers Delight:Im six-foot-one and Im tons of fun and I dress to a TYou see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciouslyI got body guards, I got two big cars, I definitely aint the whackI got a Lincoln Continental and a sun-roofed CadillacSo after school, I take {{a dip in the}} pool, which is really on the wallI got a color TV, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the Knicks play basketball ...|$|E
5000|$|On 24 March 2013, Penny Black Music {{published}} {{an interview with}} Rutherford.Paul Waller, interviewer: So, in 1989, after the demise of Frankie you released your solo album, [...] "Oh World". You {{must have had a}} lot more artistic control with that project, but it wasn't the greatest of times for you. Do you look fondly on that time of your life at all?Rutherford: No, no I don't. I was going through such a big personal downer at that time. My partner died during my planned solo career so I disappeared for a while because I thought it was more important for him. He died due to AIDS complications. It was really quite hard to deal with and took five years out of my life. I made the [...] "Oh World" [...] album during the middle of all this, so when you listen to it now you can hear where a lot of the music comes from in a way. I wasn't turning up for stuff and the record company was getting really cheesed with me. I {{spent a lot of time}} in hospitals, and it just got all too much for me. There were bigger things going on as well that I can't really tell you about but they knew. I thought I was wasting their time, my time and worst of all his time which was more precious than anything. But some people can deal with that sort of situation. I now see it as sort of a gift in a way; I stepped up. At the time I stood up for gay rights so much. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> it now as a good thing for me. It turned me into a better person, I think.|$|E
