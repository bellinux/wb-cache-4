25|$|Under the Equality Act 2006, a new Equality and Human Rights Commission was established, subsuming <b>specialist</b> <b>bodies</b> from before. Its role is in research, {{promotion}} and raising awareness. It {{does not have}} enforcement powers.

25|$|On {{the other}} end of the spectrum, there is the green-light {{approach}} derived from the utilitarian school of thought associated with legal philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. The green-light approach regards state involvement as an effective means to facilitate the delivery of communitarian goals. Hence, ouster clauses are regarded as useful devices to keep a conservatively inclined judiciary at bay. One such communitarian goal achieved by ouster clauses is that it results in consistency and finality in the implementation of policy considerations by encouraging <b>specialist</b> <b>bodies</b> to act as adjudicators in certain areas of administration.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} an {{enormous}} growth {{of interest in the}} ICD and ways had to be found of responding to this, partly by modifying the classification itself and partly by introducing special coding provisions. A number of representations were made by <b>specialist</b> <b>bodies</b> which had become interested in using the ICD for their own statistics. Some subject areas in the classification were regarded as inappropriately arranged and there was considerable pressure for more detail and for adaptation of the classification to make it more relevant for the evaluation of medical care, by classifying conditions to the chapters concerned with the part of the body affected rather than to those dealing with the underlying generalized disease.|$|E

Around 20,000 discrimination cases are brought each year to UK tribunals.|$|E

After that Mann & Overton's designer and coachbuilders had only to replace Austin's usual V-shaped windscreen with a flat upright screen and amend the offside front door opening of a hire car to make a luggage platform.Most buyers chose landaulette bodywork because the very back section of the roof could be lowered in summer.The first new generation Mann & Overton Austin entered service in April-May 1930.|$|E

50|$|In several {{countries}} around the world, <b>specialist</b> <b>bodies</b> {{have been set up}} to ensure high quality practice in addiction medicine. For example, within the United States, there are two accepted specialty examinations. One is a Board Certification in Addiction Psychiatry from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. The other is a Board Certification in Addiction Medicine from the American Board of Preventive Medicine. The latter approach is available to all physicians with primary Board certification, while the former is available only to board-certified psychiatrists. Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine may also seek board certification via the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). The Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine must have a primary board certification in Neurology & Psychiatry or Internal Medicine from the American Osteopathic Association and complete an AOA approved addiction medicine fellowship.
