500|$|The {{rail traffic}} on Polish railway lines was {{extremely}} dense. An average of 420 German military trains were passing through every 24 hours {{on top of}} internal traffic already in 1941. The Holocaust trains were routinely delayed en route; some transports took many days to arrive. Hundreds of prisoners died from exhaustion, suffocation and thirst while in transit to the camp in the overcrowded wagons. In extreme cases such as the Biała Podlaska transport of 6,000 Jews travelling only a [...] distance, up to 90 per cent of people were already dead when the sealed doors flew open. From September 1942 on, both Polish and foreign Jews were greeted with a brief verbal announcement. An earlier <b>signboard</b> with directions was removed because it was clearly insufficient.

The bell {{was intended to be}} rung as an air-raid siren during the Second World War. In the early 19th century the pub's <b>signboard</b> carried the arms of the Congreve family, as well as branding for a company named [...] "Adams". In the British Parliamentary Papers of 1817, the Committee on the State of the Police in the Metropolis reported evidence of a John Adams—a Reading-based distiller and hop merchant—who competed for business against Simonds' Brewery. By 1850, the pub brewed beer on-site; a brewery was built as an out-building behind the main pub building. John Knight produced beer at the pub for 40 years, selling it for 2d. The brewery building is still in existence, with the wooden louvres still operational. The building is now the pub's kitchen. In the 1970s, the pub was owned by Whitbread. In the mid-1990s the pub was taken over by Gales Brewery (having previously been a free house), later becoming tied to Fuller's Brewery on their acquisition of Gales in 2006. In the 1970s, the pub was home to the Kennet Folk Club.|$|E
500|$|Ghosh {{acknowledges}} the allusions to Ray's films. In one scene, Vidya asks {{the manager of}} the guest house why there is no hot water although the <b>signboard</b> had claimed [...] "running hot water". The manager explains that the sign refers for his errand boy, who runs to deliver hot water in a kettle whenever required. This alludes to a similar scene in Ray's Joi Baba Felunath (1979). In an interview with The Telegraph, Ghosh says that the way Vidya looks out and moves from window to window in the guest-house room is reminiscent of Ray's Charulata (1964), where the actress Madhabi Mukherjee enjoys glimpses of the outside world through the blinds of windows. He also {{acknowledges the}} influence of Mahanagar (1963), another Ray film noted for its portrayal of Kolkata. According to the director, he was inspired by particular scenes of Ray's Nayak (1966) to plan the portrayal of complex emotional issues between Vidya and the police officer Rana, especially Rana's awe in the presence of Vidya. Ghosh expresses his inspiration from Ray's Aranyer Dinratri (1970) in which Ray [...] "wanted the audience to be inside the car with the four guys all the time. So the camera never leaves the car." [...] Ghosh shot a similar scene, hoping the audience would become [...] "like Vidya's fellow passenger." ...|$|E

500|$|Congress leader Hussain Dalwai said, [...] "It's a sad {{commentary}} on the administration which {{has come to a}} stage where it requires the high court intervention". He put the onus of his party's coalition partner, saying, [...] "Whether it is MNS violence in the <b>signboard</b> or dalit killing at Khairlanji it shows an insensitive administration. The NCP president Sharad Pawar should seriously reflect on the working of the state home department." [...] Even NCP leaders including Ajit Pawar and Chhagan Bhujbal have told RR Patil and Deshmukh, in the cabinet meet to [...] "either act or shut up". Suggesting that the Maharashtra government was not keen on taking strong action against MNS chief Raj Thackeray, the NDA on Thursday described as [...] "stage-managed show" [...] the arrest and bail for him in cases of violence against north Indians in the state. BJP MP Shahnawaz Hussain said, [...] "Congress is Raj Thackeray's event management company and it is trying to project Raj's arrest as an event instead of making any serious effort to check the violent campaign of MNS against north Indians. There is match-fixing between Raj and the Maharashtra government. The state government deliberately books him under small sections and he gets bail." [...] Talking on the attacks on North Indian candidates at the All-India Railway Recruitment examinations in Mumbai, Rajya Sabha MP and JD-U national general secretary Shivananda Tiwari also attacked Congress for [...] "promoting" [...] the MNS chief and comparing him with slain Punjab separatist leader Bhindarwale. [...] "Congress party has a mastery in creating 'bhasmasurs' (self destructing demons). Earlier they created Bhindranwale in Punjab, which killed a Congress Prime Minister.

500|$|Shubhangi Khapre of Daily News and Analysis {{noted in}} her article titled Forget {{political}} will, Raj has state support, stated, [...] "Ever since its birth on 9 March 2006, MNS has been nurtured by the ruling Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) with an ulterior motive of splitting the Shiv Sena. Ironically, the Sena itself was given a 'protected childhood' in the late 1960s by the then Congress {{as a tool to}} war with the Communist Party of India, which had a strong presence in Mumbai. Not surprisingly, covertly the administration has provided Raj adequate platform to consolidate the political forum through an emotive Marathi plank. The purpose is to split the 26% [...] Marathi voters in Mumbai, which is rather loyal to the Shiv Sena. The electoral merit of the MNS remains untested but its ability to bond with sons of the soil cannot be cursorily dismissed in Mumbai, Thane, Nashik and Pune." [...] She further noted, [...] "Under chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the Congress sees a double advantage in the strategy: A proactive MNS will divide Sena voters {{on the one hand and}} drive Mumbai’s North Indian community— which was being targeted as [...] "outsiders" [...] by the MNS— to Congress’s lap. North Indians, who dominate 48 essential services in Mumbai, constitute a sizeable— and hence decisive— vote bank. Forget political will, it is well-calculated political design which has withheld the Democratic Front government from taking stern action against Raj. Or else, how does one explain home minister RR Patil engaging in a telephone conversation urging him to slow down instead of arresting his men indulging in violence on streets?" [...] She also said, [...] "(Vilasrao) Deshmukh is no better. He has often said, [...] "My administration will not tolerate divisive forces. Nobody is above the law"." [...] She expressed her views in reference to, Bombay High Court on lashing out at the Maharashtra government over the threat given by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena about displaying the Marathi <b>signboard</b> on the shops and establishments in the metropolis. [...] "If you don't have political will, then give that message to the people that we can not do anything," [...] Division Bench of Justice J N Patel and K K Tated said dissatisfied about government's inaction against hooliganism of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena activists. [...] "Why no action has been taken against respondent number six (Raj Thackeray)? Are some people 'untouchable' for you?" [...] Justice Patel asked as government failed to file a proper reply regarding the action taken.|$|E
