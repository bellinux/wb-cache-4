Both programs consist of several modules containing information, personal stories by fellow patients, videos, and exercises with feedback. Health care professionals can refer their patients to the programs. However, the use of the program in daily practice is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the use and characteristics of users of the online self-management programs "Living with eczema," and "Living with food allergy," and to investigate factors related to the use of the trainings. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was carried out in which the outcome parameters were the number <b>of</b> <b>log-ins</b> by patients, the number of hits on the system's core features, disease severity, quality of life, and domains of self-management. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize sample characteristics and to describe number <b>of</b> <b>log-ins</b> and hits per module and per functionality. Correlation and regression analyses were used to explore the relation between the number <b>of</b> <b>log-ins</b> and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Since the start, 299 adult patients have been referred to the online AD program; 173 logged in for at least one occasion. Data from 75 AD patients were available for analyses. Mean number <b>of</b> <b>log-ins</b> was 3. 1 (range 1 - 11). Linear regression with the number <b>of</b> <b>log-ins</b> as dependent variable showed that age and quality of life contributed most to the model, with betas of. 35 (P=. 002) and. 26 (P=. 05), respectively, and an R(2) of. 23. Two hundred fourteen adult FA patients were referred to the online FA training, 124 logged in for at least one occasion and data from 45 patients were available for analysis. Mean number <b>of</b> <b>log-ins</b> was 3. 0 (range 1 - 11). Linear regression with the number <b>of</b> <b>log-ins</b> as dependent variable revealed that adding the self-management domain "social integration and support" to the model led to an R(2) of. 13. The modules with information about the disease, diagnosis, and treatment were most visited. Most hits were on the information parts of the modules (55 - 58 %), followed by exercises (30 - 32 %). CONCLUSIONS: The online self-management programs "Living with eczema" and "Living with food allergy" were used by patients in addition to the usual face-to-face care. Almost 60 % of all referred patients logged in, with an average <b>of</b> three <b>log-ins.</b> All modules seemed to be relevant, but there is room for improvement in the use of the training. Age, quality of life, and lower social integration and support were related to the use of the training, but only part of the variance in use could be explained by these variables...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism), {{the most}} common genetic {{variations}} between human beings, {{is believed to be}} a promising way towards personalized medicine. As more and more research on SNPs are being conducted, non-standard nomenclatures may generate potential problems. The most serious issue is that researchers cannot perform cross referencing among different SNP databases. This will result in more resources and time required to track SNPs. It could be detrimental to the entire academic community. Results UASIS (Universal Automated SNP Identification System) is a web-based server for SNP nomenclature standardization and translation at DNA level. Three utilities are available. They are UASIS Aligner, Universal SNP Name Generator and SNP Name Mapper. UASIS maps SNPs from different databases, including dbSNP, GWAS, HapMap and JSNP etc., into an uniform view efficiently using a proposed universal nomenclature and state-of-art alignment algorithms. UASIS is freely available at [URL] with no requirement <b>of</b> <b>log-in.</b> Conclusions UASIS is a helpful platform for SNP cross referencing and tracking. By providing an informative, unique and unambiguous nomenclature, which utilizes unique position of a SNP, we aim to resolve the ambiguity of SNP nomenclatures currently practised. Our universal nomenclature is a good complement to mainstream SNP notations such as rs# and HGVS guidelines. UASIS acts as a bridge to connect heterogeneous representations of SNPs. </p...|$|R

40|$|Self-monitoring is the {{centerpiece}} of behavioral weight loss intervention programs. This article presents a systematic review of the literature on three components of self-monitoring in behavioral weight loss studies: diet, exercise, and self-weighing. This review included articles that were published between 1993 and 2009 that reported on the relationship between weight loss and these self-monitoring strategies. Of the 22 studies identified, 15 focused on dietary self-monitoring, one on self-monitoring exercise, and six on self-weighing. A wide array of methods was used to perform self-monitoring; the paper diary was used most often. Adherence to self-monitoring was reported most frequently as the number of diaries completed or the frequency <b>of</b> <b>log-ins</b> or reported weights. The use of technology, which included the Internet, personal digital assistants, and electronic digital scales were reported in five studies. Descriptive designs were used in the earlier studies whereas more recent reports involved prospective studies and randomized trials that examined the effect of self-monitoring on weight loss. A significant association between self-monitoring and weight loss was consistently found; however, the level of evidence was weak because of methodologic limitations. The most significant limitations of the reviewed studies were the homogenous samples and reliance on self-report. In all but two studies, the samples were predominantly white and women. This review highlights the need for studies in more diverse populations, for objective measures of adherence to self-monitoring, and for studies that establish the required dose of self-monitoring for successful outcomes. © 2011 American Dietetic Association...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to answer the following questions:. • What are the similarities among various log-in and sign-in pages? • What are the differences among various log-in and sign-in pages? • What do users think about these differences and similarities? BY ABBAS MOALLEM og-in and sign-in pages are important components of most commercial Web sites. Through log-in pages, users can enter data for an application, perform daily tasks, access content, place orders, or view their accounts or the status of their orders. A user might log in to several sites for a variety of reasons. For example, one might log in to a bank Web site to perform transactions, to a brokerage account to trade stocks, or to an e-mail account to view or send e-mails. Consequently, one might log in more than 10 times in a typical day. The information that users enter on various log-in and sign-in pages is almost identical: their usernames and pass-words. Occasionally (sometimes frequently), users forget their usernames or passwords and must either get help to remember them or ask for their information to be reset. Even though the components <b>of</b> <b>log-in</b> or sign-in pages seem to be almost identical, there are important inconsisten-cies and differences among commercial and public Web sites, making the user's task more complicated. These include the vocabulary, the physical attributes of the objects, and the configuration of the pages. Besides forgetting their different usernames and passwords, users often must select a different username or password based on the security requirements of each site (Krause 2003; Sasse, Brostoff, & Weirich 2001). To improve and standardize the log-in page, it is important to investigate current design and user preferences in this domain. In this article, I describe a study whose results I hope will aid designers in making more effective log-in and slgn-m pages. Fo ot your U:;llr 10...|$|R

40|$|Fracture {{processes}} in different materials, structural components and natural objects are often occured by formation and transformation of ordered systems of cracks or cracklike faults (<b>structures</b> <b>of</b> fracture). Scale interaction {{can lead to}} formation of a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> fracture of different length scales. Ordered systems of cracks or cracklike faults are observed, e. g., at fracture of ceramics and rocks under biaxial compression, pipeline steels and titanium under the hydrogen absorption, ice cover under the wind action. In the paper an approach is developed for modeling of processes of formation of hierarchical systems <b>of</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> fracture. The approach implies, first, an analysis of a sequence of events leading to formation of separate elements <b>of</b> a <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> fracture of a certain scale (rank) taking into account local perturbations of the stress-deformation field caused by an influence <b>of</b> the initial <b>structure</b> and/or texture <b>of</b> the object under consideration.
