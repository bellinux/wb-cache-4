5|$|A 2005 {{study showed}} the {{potential}} for using probiotics for controlling S.iniae infection in trout. This <b>study</b> <b>used</b> the gastrointestinal contents of rainbow trout to scan for bacteria that inhibited growth of S.iniae and Lactococcus garvieae. They identified Aeromonas sobria as a potential candidate for control of S.iniae and L.garvieae infections in aquaculture. A.sobria, given live in the feed, protected the trout when challenged with S.iniae or L.garvieae.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{appear to}} use just {{two pieces of}} {{information}} to decide where to go, namely how dark {{it is and how}} many other cockroaches there are. A <b>study</b> <b>used</b> specially-scented roach-sized robots that appear to the roaches as real to demonstrate that once there are enough insects in a place to form a critical mass, the roaches accepted the collective decision on where to hide, even if this was an unusually light place.|$|E

30|$|Results: Data from 87 {{studies were}} {{included}} in the analysis (Fig.  115). Fifty-five <b>studies</b> <b>used</b> Early-SOFA, 32 <b>studies</b> <b>used</b> Late-SOFA and 25 <b>studies</b> <b>used</b> Delta-SOFA as an endpoint. Studies reporting different SOFA abstractions had comparable characteristics regarding sample size, year of publication and study population.|$|R
30|$|Two <b>studies</b> <b>used</b> {{pathological}} evaluation as {{the reference}} standard [46, 47].

The <b>studies</b> <b>using</b> pathological evaluation were retrospective studies. All {{but one of}} the <b>studies</b> that <b>used</b> a second DAT SPECT scan was prospective studies.|$|R
5|$|Another 2016 <b>study</b> <b>used</b> laser-stimulated {{fluorescence}} imaging {{to analyze the}} internal structure of the bristles. The highly cornified bristles are arranged in tight clusters of three to six individual bristles, with each bristle being filled with pulp. The authors considered the bristles as being homologous to the quills of Tianyulong, the elongated broad filamentous feathers (EBFFs) of Beipiaosaurus, and possibly the feathers of birds as well. Similar bristles are found in extant birds such as the horned screamer; these structures differ from feathers in {{that they do not}} develop from a follicle, but both arise from discrete cell populations. A darkened soft-tissue structure was also found near the jugal horn; this may represent a keratinous sheath or a skin flap.|$|E
5|$|Goofus and Gallant strips {{have been}} used for {{research}} purposes. A 2006 study gauging the development of ideas of respect and disrespect among American children used strips from the comic as stimuli to which the subjects could provide qualitative responses regarding why they believed Goofus's or Gallant's actions were respectful or disrespectful. A 2012 <b>study</b> <b>used</b> the strips to prompt autistic and allistic children to identify whether the depicted child (either Goofus or Gallant) was behaving badly while researchers used an fMRI to measure the neural networks used in reaching their conclusions.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{a genetic}} study was made basing on the {{evolutionary}} history of common elands. Located in the sub-Saharan savanna biome of east and southern Africa, the <b>study</b> <b>used</b> methods like analysis of mitochondrial DNA control-region fragments from 122 individuals {{to learn more}} about various topics, such as the phylogeography, genetic diversity, demographic history of the species. The conclusions strongly supported the presence of a longer-standing population in the south and a mosaic of Pleistocene refugia in the east. It is believed that today their extinction from these parts could be due to colonization. The similarity of dates obtained from more studies indicates a significant event c. 200 ka, which had brought a great change in the genetic history of the species.|$|E

5|$|In July 2017, a {{study by}} William Sellers et al., {{published}} in the journal PeerJ found that an adult Tyrannosaurus was incapable of running due to very high skeletal loads. The <b>study</b> <b>used</b> the latest computing technology to test its findings. The researchers used two different structural mechanical systems to create the computer model. The weight they settled on for their calculations was a conservative estimate of 7 tons. The model showed that speeds above 11mph (18km/h) would have probably shattered the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus. The finding may mean that running was also not possible for other giant theropod dinosaurs like Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Acrocanthosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{potatoes}} {{were chosen}} {{because they were}} deemed substantially equivalent to non-genetically modified Desiree Red potatoes. The <b>study</b> <b>used</b> two transgenic lines of potato, both with the GNA gene inserted. They were grown in the same conditions as the non-genetically modified parent plant. According to Pusztai, the potatoes were not substantially equivalent, {{as one of the}} transgenic lines contained 20 percent less protein than the other, and the starch and sugar contents varied by up to 20 percent among the three lines. Pusztai claimed that these differences were reason enough to discontinue further experimentation.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{theoretically}} refine the items, several <b>studies</b> <b>used</b> opinions of experts (74.2 %, n[*]=[*] 78), whereas others used target population opinions (43.8 %, n[*]=[*] 46).

25|$|The {{difference}} between the Lancet and U.N. pre-invasion mortality rates is 3.5 deaths/1,000/year. The Lancet <b>study</b> <b>used</b> the number of 26,112,353 (from Lancet supplement) as the population of Iraq. 3.5 times 26,112 equals 91,392. So 3.5 deaths/1,000/year means around 91,400 deaths in one year in a population of 26.1 million.|$|E

25|$|A {{very small}} {{preliminary}} {{study published in}} 2016 shows that prayer helps people who have achieved sobriety in Alcoholics Anonymous reduce cravings for alcohol. The <b>study</b> <b>used</b> a MRI machine to scan how subjects reacted to images of people drinking. The study randomly assigned the subjects, so that some subjects saw the images after saying prayers in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous; others after reading newspaper articles. The people who had just seen the prayers reported feeling fewer cravings for alcohol; the MRI scans of their brains confirmed {{that there was a}} different reaction.|$|E

25|$|In February 2014, the Automotive Science Group (ASG) {{published}} {{the result of}} a study conducted to assess the life-cycle of over 1,300 automobiles across nine categories sold in North America. The study found that among advanced automotive technologies, the Nissan Leaf holds the smallest life-cycle environmental footprint of any model year 2014 automobile available in the North American market with minimum four-person occupancy. The study concluded that the increased environmental impacts of manufacturing the battery electric technology is more than offset with increased environmental performance during operational life.

25|$|With the {{introduction}} of statistical software that can process large datasets easily, a number of state- or country-wide studies {{have been carried out}} to investigate whether birthdays have any effect on mortality. The first large-scale <b>study</b> <b>used</b> the records of 2,745,149 Californians who died between 1969 and 1990. After correcting for confounding factors such as seasonality in deaths, elective surgery, and people born on February 29, there was a significant increase in deaths in the week before the individual's birthday for men, and in the week after the birthday for women – in both cases, mortality did not peak on the birthday, but close to it. This effect was consistent across age and race cohorts.|$|E
