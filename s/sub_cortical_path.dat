40|$|Background: Diabetes {{mellitus}} is a well-recognized {{risk factor}} for ischaemic stroke. Stroke in diabetic patients is different from stroke in non-diabetics from several perspectives. There is no local study on this topic. This is the first study from Pakistan, in which pattern of stroke in diabetics have been described and compared with non-diabetics. The object {{of this study was}} to compare pattern of stroke in diabetic subjects with non-diabetics. Methods: This is a prospective comparative cross sectional study, carried out at Liaquat national hospital, Karachi, neurology department from October to March 2006. Fifty patients were enrolled in diabetic group and 50 in non-diabetic. Clinical features, risk factors and stroke patterns were identified. Results: Mean age was 59. 5 (± 11. 82) in diabetics and 60. 4 (± 14. 8) in non diabetics. There was slight preponderance of male patients in non diabetic group. Out of 50 diabetic patients, 44 (88. 0 %) had ischaemic stroke and 6 (12. 0 %) had intracerebral haemorrhage. In non-diabetics, 29 (58. 0 %) had ischaemic stroke while 21 (42. 0 %) had intracerebral haemorrhage. On further analysis of ischaemic stroke, cortical infarcts (CI) was found in 22, <b>sub</b> <b>cortical</b> infarcts (SCI) in 14, brainstem in 5 and cerebellar in 2 diabetic patients. CI was also the commonest subtype of ischaemic stroke in non-diabetics. Conclusion: Patterns of stroke in diabetics are different from non-diabetics.

40|$|Little {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} the relationship between neurological lesions and quality of life (QL) in stroke research. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the impact of stroke types and lesion locations on QL. The study sample was composed of 441 stroke patients. Lesion locations and stroke types were divided into 194 left-sided and 173 right-sided lesions, 61 infratentorial strokes (55 infarctions and 6 hemorrhages), and 335 supratentorial strokes (204 [sub]cortical infarctions, 82 lacunar infarctions, and 49 hemorrhages). Six months after stroke, QL was assessed with the Sickness Impact Profile. Age-adjusted QL scores were expressed in standard scores. Although patients with left-sided lesions had more speech pathology (P <. 001), there was slightly more QL deterioration in patients with right-sided lesions. Patients with infratentorial strokes reported better overall functioning than patients with supratentorial strokes (P =. 02). Patients with lacunar infarction had less dysfunction compared to patients with (<b>sub)</b> <b>cortical</b> lesions (P <. 001). There was no difference in QL between supratentorial (<b>sub)</b> <b>cortical</b> infarcts and hemorrhages. Lesion locations and stroke types did not affect patients' emotional distress. Severely impaired QL patterns were related significantly to older age (P <. 001), comorbidity (P =. 02), stroke severity (P <. 001), and supratentorial lesions (P =. 02). There is only a weak relationship between lesion laterality and QL. Survivors of hemorrhagic strokes do not evidence more QL impairment than survivors of ischemic strokes. Stroke per se is not unequivocally followed by emotional discomfort. In addition to stroke type, patient and clinical characteristics are also important in explaining impaired QL pattern...|$|R

40|$|In humans {{breathing}} {{is an essential}} behaviour for life. It is recognized that humans and animals can perceive or sense their breathing, although the actual <b>cortical</b> and <b>sub</b> <b>cortical</b> structures by which this occurs remains unknown. The processing of sensations presumably arise from afferent information originating from mechanoreceptors within {{the muscles of the}} upper and lower airways, lungs and chest wall. This information is integrated by the central nervous system, which leads to a perception of respiratory sensations at th~ cortex, although the specific contnbutions of these sources remain unknown. In addition, distressing respiratory sensations such as breathlessness (dyspnoea). and hyperinflation occur in individuals exhibiting pulmonary disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In response to these sensations, individuals can also voluntarily or behaviourally adjust their breathing. Hence, the aim of this thesis was to investigate: (i) the modulation of respiratory related sensory activity measured from the cortex in humans, using electroencephalography in response to applications of transient inspiratory occlusions (TIas) during hyperinflation, voluntary breathing and in tracheostomy patients' who lack an upper airway and (ii) the cortical and subcortical structures mediating the response to the TIO by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results of these studies show that (i) voluntary breathing modulates respiratory perception, whereas perception is unaffected in tracheostomy patients and in hyperinflated states in response to TIas; and (ii) TIas can also generate <b>cortical</b> and <b>sub</b> <b>cortical</b> activity specifically activating sensory - motor structures including the, primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, supplementary motor area, inferior parietal areas, thalamus and cerebellum.

40|$|A whole {{network of}} brain areas showing larger {{response}} to faces than other visual stimuli {{has been identified}} in the human brain using fMRI (Sergent, 1992; Haxby, 2000). Most studies identify only a subset of this network, by comparing the presentation of face pictures {{to all kinds of}} object categories mixed up (e. g., Kanwisher, 1997), or to scrambled faces (e. g., Ishaï, 2005), using different statistical thresholds. Given these differences of approaches, the (<b>sub)</b> <b>cortical</b> face network can be artificially overextended (Downing & Wiggett, 2008), or minimized in different studies, both at the local (size of regions) and global (number of regions) levels. Here we conducted an analysis of a large set of right-handed subjects (40), tested with a new whole-brain localizer to control for both high-level and low-level differences between faces and objects. Pictures of faces, cars and their phase-scrambled counterparts were used in a 2 x 2 block design. Group-level (random effect) and single subject (ROI) analyses were made. A conjunction of two contrasts (F-SF and F-C) identified 6 regions: FFA, OFA, amygdala, pSTS, AIT and thalamus. All these regions but the amygdala showed clear right lateralization. Interestingly, the FFA showed the least face-selective response among the cortical face network: it presented a significantly larger response to pictures of cars than scrambled cars [t= 9. 3, much more than amygdala (t= 2. 6), AIT (t= 2. 1) and other regions (NS) ], and was also sensitive to low-level properties of faces [SF - SO; t= 5. 1; NS in other areas]. These observations suggest that, contrary to other areas of the network, including the OFA, the FFA is a region that may contain populations of neurons that are specific to faces intermixed with populations responding more generally to object categories.

A significant finding was that a sound increased the perceived brightness of the light, regardless of their relative spatial locations, provided the light's image was projected onto the fovea. Here, the apparent lack of the spatial rule, further differentiates cortical and tectal multisensory neurons. Little empirical evidence exists to justify this dichotomy.

40|$|Summary In daily life, a {{large number}} of {{activities}} require the integrated use of both hands. For instance, bimanual motor control is needed to tie your shoelaces, to open a jar, to drive a car or to ride a bike. In order to accurately time and execute such movements, communication between both hemispheres via the corpus callosum (CC) is required. Therefore, an important element of the present thesis was the exploration of the specific role of the CC in bimanual coordination. In addition, bimanual motor control was studied in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI patients often experience damage to the CC due to its specific location and composition, and generally demonstrate persistent motor control deficits for years following the injury. Here, we wanted to gain insights into injury-related bimanual coordination deficits as well as concomitant alterations in (<b>sub)</b> <b>cortical</b> motor systems. In part oneof the present thesis we first included a literature survey. This extensive overview revealed an essential role of the CC in bimanual coordination performance, and to some extent made it possible to map specific bimanual task characteristics onto different CC subregions, particularly regarding the type of sensory modality involved. In this literature reviewour first experimental study was included in which the microstructural organization of 7 CC subregions of healthy young adults was correlated with performance on a complex bimanual coordination task, performed either with or without augmented visual feedback. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) results demonstrated that bimanual coordination skills, particularlyin the absence of augmented visual feedback, were related to microstructural properties of the CC subsections connecting bilateral primary motor and bilateral occipital cortices. We concluded that in a group of healthy young adults, brain structure can predict variation in bimanual coordination performance. Subsequently, in the same group of healthy subjects, the added value of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI; providing a more complete picture of the white matter microstructural organization) relative to DTI was explored in relating white matter microstructure to bimanual performance. Although DKI resulted in higher absolute values of diffusion, and lower absolute values of anisotropy, associations between bimanual performance and white matter organization were comparable for bothdiffusion models. In {{the second part of the}} present thesis the focus shifted from the healthy brain to the traumatically injured brain. On the one hand we investigated TBI-induced grey matter volumetric alterations, and on the other hand TBI-induced functional (<b>sub)</b> <b>cortical</b> reorganization, both in relation to bimanual task performance. Structural imaging revealed enlarged ventricles and atrophy in overall and regional subcortical grey matter volume in TBI patients relative to controls. Behaviorally, TBI patients demonstrated poorer (i. e., slower and less accurate) bimanual performance than controls, which was significantly related to volume reductions in subcortical motor-related grey matter structures. Finally, we examined whether these bimanual coordination deficits were accompanied with altered brain function. Compared with controls, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings in TBI revealed reduced (<b>sub)</b> <b>cortical</b> activations during the planning phase of the movement, followed by more widespread and increased neural activity during the execution phase. It was suggested that TBI-induced altered planning-related activations might be interrelated with the nonselective recruitment of brain areas during execution, as well as with impaired motor control. In conclusion, the present doctoral thesis provided evidence for the important and rather specific role of the corpus callosum in bimanual coordination. With the introduction of new neuroimaging techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging, this brain structure-function relationship can now be described at a microstructural level, resulting in increased specificity. In addition, we demonstrated that TBI-induced persistent impairments in bimanual motor control were related to subcortical grey matter loss, and were accompanied by altered functional activations, as evidenced by fMRI. Ultimately, these findings may contribute indirectly to the improvement and establishment of new motor rehabilitation approaches following traumatic brain injury. status: publishe...|$|R

Methods: Thirty-three patients (19 women and 14 men; mean age:': SO, 53 :': 16 y) with moderate major depressive disorder were studied before 6 wk of treatment with tricyclic antideDres sants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or a course of elec troconvulsive therapy, and 31 ofthese patients were also studied afterward. A comparison group of 25 healthy volunteers (13 women and 12 men; mean age, 49 15 y) were studied once. rCBF was assessed using 99 mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime SPECT. Images were analyzed using globally normalized statistical parametric mapping localized to the Montreal Neuro logic Institute brain atlas. Results: Baseline rCBF was lower in depressed patients than in controls in the frontal cortex and <b>sub</b> <b>cortical</b> nuclei bilaterally. A response to medication was associ ated with normalization of rCBF deficits, whereas a response to electroconvulsive therapy was associated with an additional rCBF decrease in the parietotemporal and cerebellar regions bi iaterally. Conclusion: Hypoperfusion in major depressive disor der largely normalizes after a response to pharmacotherapy. Perfusion changes after a response to electroconvulsive therapy may follow a different course...|$|R
40|$|Study {{design and}} objectives:Case {{report and review}} of {{supernumerary}} phantom limbs in patients suffering from spinal cord injury (SCI). Setting:SCI rehabilitation centre. Case report:After a ski accident, a 71 -year-old man suffered an incomplete SCI (level C 3; AIS C, central cord syndrome), with a C 3 /C 4 dislocation fracture. From the first week after injury, he experienced a phantom duplication of both upper limbs that lasted for 7 months. The supernumerary limbs were only occasionally related to painful sensation, specifically when they were perceived as crossed on his trunk. Although the painful sensations were responsive to pain medication, {{the presence of the}} illusory limb sensations were persistent. During neurological recovery, the supernumerary limbs gradually disappeared. A rubber hand illusion paradigm was used twice during recovery to monitor the patient's ability to integrate visual, tactile and proprioceptive stimuli. Conclusion:Overall, the clinical relevance of supernumerary phantom limbs is not clear, specific treatment protocols have not yet been developed, and the underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood. Supernumerary phantom limbs have been previously reported in patients with (<b>sub)</b> <b>cortical</b> lesions, but might be rather undocumented in patients suffering from traumatic SCI. For the appropriate diagnosis and treatment after SCI, supernumerary phantoms should be distinguished from other phantom sensations and pain syndromes after SCI.

40|$|A biologically {{detailed}} {{computational model}} is described of how categorization judgments become automatic in tasks {{that depend on}} procedural learning. The model assumes 2 neural pathways from sensory association cortex to the premotor area that mediates response selection. A longer and slower path projects to the premotor area via the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus. A faster, purely <b>cortical</b> <b>path</b> projects directly to the premotor area. The model assumes that the subcortical path has greater neural plasticity because of a dopamine-mediated learning signal from the substantia nigra. In contrast, the cortical-cortical path learns more slowly via (dopamine independent) Hebbian learning. Because of its greater plasticity, early performance {{is dominated by the}} subcortical path, but the development of automaticity is characterized by a transfer of control to the faster cortical-cortical projection. The model, called SPEED (Subcortical Pathways Enable Expertise Development), includes differential equations that describe activation in the relevant brain areas and difference equations that describe the 2 - and 3 -factor learning. A variety of simulations are described, showing that the model accounts for some classic single-cell recording and behavioral results...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{knowledge}} on effect of location of infarct and volume of infarct on motor and functional outcomes is ambiguous due to variations in methodology and outcome measures used. This narrative review is aimed to summaries the studies on infarct location and volume related to motor and functional outcome, {{for a better}} understanding of the conclusions and limitation of the studies. Methodology: Literature search was done with key words of location of infarcts, size of infarct, motor recovery and functional recovery with Boolean term AND. Studies using outcome measures of multiple domain was not considered for inclusion. Results: 13 studies were identified in an extensive search without a time limit. Studies were categorized under location and volume with motor and functional recovery as variables. Majority of studies were done in isolation to any two variables, location outnumbered volume. The relationship with location and motor outcome was inconclusive, though two studies concluded that cortical infarcts had better scores than <b>sub</b> <b>cortical.</b> Volume was moderately associated with motor and functional recovery. Majority of the studies concluded a relationship between location and functional outcome, however the results are variable. Conclusion: Only few studies have analyzed the impact of infarct in different location and results were inconclusive. Outcome measures were summative in nature, not reflecting recovery in upper and lower extremities in isolation. The amount of recovery is analysed with initial deficits. We suggest more studies are required in this area to provide clarity. ...|$|R
40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) {{is often}} {{associated}} with cognitive deficits, although their severity varies considerably between patients. Recently, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to show that individual differences in gray matter (GM) volume relate to cognitive heterogeneity in PD. VBM does, however, not differentiate between cortical thickness (CTh) and surface area (SA), which might be independently affected in PD. We therefore re-analyzed our cohort using the surface-based method FreeSurfer, and investigated (i) CTh, SA, and (<b>sub)</b> <b>cortical</b> GM volume differences between 93 PD patients and 45 matched controls, and (ii) the relation between these structural measures and cognitive performance on six neuropsychological tasks within the PD group. We found cortical thinning in PD patients in the left pericalcarine gyrus, extending to cuneus, precuneus and lingual areas and left inferior parietal cortex, bilateral rostral middle frontal cortex, and right cuneus, and increased cortical surface area in the left pars triangularis. Within the PD group, we found negative correlations between (i) CTh of occipital areas and performance on a verbal memory task, (ii) SA and volume of the frontal cortex and visuospatial memory performance, and, (iii) volume of the right thalamus and scores on two verbal fluency tasks. Our primary findings illustrate that i) CTh and SA are differentially affected in PD, and ii) VBM and FreeSurfer yield non-overlapping results in an identical dataset. We argue that this discrepancy is due to technical differences and the subtlety of the PD-related structural changes...|$|R
40|$|Cerebro-vascular {{disease in}} an {{important}} and a frequent cause of dementia. However, the prevalence and magnitude of global cognitive dysfunction in acute stroke has not been studied. Folstein&#x 2032;s mini mental state examination (MMSE) is 2 sensitive and reliable test and {{may serve as a}} simple tool for screening dementia. Fifty consecutive patients with first ever completed stroke in life and no past history of cognitive disturbances were administered MMSE at least 10 days after the onset of stroke. Cranial CT scans were done in all after 48 hours of stroke. CT scans were blindly analysed and graded for number, location and volume of infarctions, white matter leukoaraiosis (WMLA) and <b>cortical</b> and <b>sub</b> <b>cortical</b> atrophy. The radiological parameters of those with MMSE score of 23 or less on MMSE. Of all the conventional risk factors, only age of the patients was significantly higher in the "demented" group. Of the radiological parameters namely-number and volume of infarcts, WMLA, bi-frontal ratio (BFR), 3 rd ventricular ratio (3 VR), cella media index (CMI) and cortical index (CI), only cortical index was significantly more among patients with lower MMSE scores. Prevalence of global cerebral dysfunction first ever ischaemic stroke was 46 &#x 0025; in this study. Advanced age and cortical atrophy appear to contribute to the low scores on MMSE. Though, volume and number of infarctions were higher among patients with low score, the differences were not statistically significant...|$|R
