5|$|In {{addition}} to the national meteorological services of each nation, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center monitors the basin, and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones for the United States Government. These warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and {{can be compared to}} the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, however, the JTWC uses their own scale for intensity classifications in this basin. These classifications are Tropical Depression, Tropical Storm, Typhoon and Super Typhoon. In addition, the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau has its own <b>scale</b> <b>in</b> Chinese but uses the Typhoon Committee <b>scale</b> <b>in</b> English.|$|E

5|$|C.maenas is fished {{on a small}} <b>scale</b> <b>in</b> the {{north-east}} Atlantic Ocean, {{with approximately}} 1200tonnes being caught annually, mostly in France and the United Kingdom.

5|$|Crowley {{started the}} process of {{designing}} the Tumbler for the film by model bashing. Crowley used the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model {{to serve as the}} chassis for the Tumbler's turbine engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 <b>scale</b> <b>in</b> the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 19th and 20th centuries, the United Kingdom largely {{used the}} long scale, whereas the United States used the short scale, so that the two systems were often {{referred}} to as British and American in the English language. After several decades of increasing informal British usage of the short <b>scale,</b> <b>in</b> 1974 the government of the UK adopted it, and it is used for all official purposes. With very few exceptions, the British usage and American usage are now identical.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{the term}} great {{hurricane}} {{was used to}} describe storms that possessed winds of at least 110kn (125mph; 200km/h), large radii (over 160km / 100mi) and that caused large amounts of destruction.

5|$|In {{addition}} to its growing importance as a tourist centre, Keswick developed a reputation for its manufacture of pencils during the 19th century. It had begun on a modest <b>scale</b> <b>in</b> or about 1792, as a cottage industry, using graphite mined locally. This developed on more industrial lines in factories purpose-built by several companies. Pencil making was the town's most important manufacturing industry by the mid-19th century, textiles and leather goods having declined.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{under the}} novel {{conditions}} of attrition warfare, war pigeons in their traditional role as pigeon post saw a renaissance. Neubronner's mobile dovecote {{found its way}} to the Battle of Verdun, where it proved so advantageous that similar facilities were used on a larger <b>scale</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of the Somme. After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified.|$|E

5|$|On a {{strategic}} scale, a natural choke point was present between the northern shore of Lake Peipus and the Gulf of Finland.
