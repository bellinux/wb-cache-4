5|$|Agriculture, {{largely based}} on livestock, has {{traditionally}} been the main occupation in the central and western parts of the county. There are a mix of large and <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> businesses, and a thriving dairy sector in the Vale of Clwyd. Many of the towns have livestock markets and the farming industry supports farm machinery merchants, vets, feed merchants, contractors and all the ancillary trades connected with agriculture. With their incomes on the decline, farmers have found opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and value-added food products.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} lending by small banks to <b>small</b> <b>farms.</b> We find that relationships, as {{measured}} by the length of tenure of farm operators, are positively related to bank lending.

When existing relationships between borrowers and incumbent lenders are stronger, however, denovo banks have greater difficulties in lending to <b>small</b> <b>farms.</b> Finally, we find that, even within the category of small banks, lending to <b>small</b> <b>farms</b> (as a percentage of a bank's assets) tends to decrease as the bank increases in size.

5|$|Authors {{have speculated}} {{on a range}} of {{buildings}} that could account for the Tower appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a Norman peel tower, built as a defence against Scottish raiders or might have been a disused poacher's lookout, but {{it is more likely that}} despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage. Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation. Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel, and tower may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents. It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.|$|E

5|$|Allen {{was forced}} to end his studies upon his father's death. While he volunteered for militia service in 1757 in {{response}} to French movements resulting in the siege of Fort William Henry, his unit received word while en route that the fort had fallen, and turned back. Even though the French and Indian War continued {{over the next several}} years, Allen did not apparently participate in any further military activities, and is presumed to have tended his farm, at least until 1762. In that year, he became part owner of an iron furnace in Salisbury. He also married Mary Brownson, a woman five years his senior, from the nearby town of Roxbury, in July 1762. They first settled in Cornwall, but moved the following year to Salisbury with their infant daughter Loraine. Allen bought a <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> and proceeded to develop the iron works. The expansion of the iron works was apparently costly to Allen; he {{was forced to}} sell off portions of the Cornwall property to raise funds, and eventually sold half of his interest in the works to his brother Heman. The Allen brothers sold their interest in the iron works in October 1765.|$|E

Following the economic turmoil of the Great Depression, the Martellos were forced from their land and moved first to Worcester, Massachusetts and then to Southbridge, Massachusetts. It was here that Leo was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, but his parents divorced soon after. Unable to care for him alone, his father sent Martello to the Catholic boarding preparatory school attached to Assumption College, Worcester, which was run by the Augustinians of the Assumption. He spent six years at the school, later describing it as the unhappiest period of his life. He studied graphology and {{from the age of}} 16 began making radio appearances as a graphologist, also writing stories for magazines.|$|E

He was exposed to politics from an early age; his father took him to several political rallies, including an 1895 speech by Democratic Party leader William Jennings Bryan. His father was a day laborer for the New Albany and St. Louis Air Line Railway. In 1898, he became disabled when he suffered heat stroke while working. His condition meant he could not work; the family became impoverished and had to subsist on the limited yield of their <b>small</b> <b>farm.</b> Minton's mother developed breast cancer in 1899. A traveling doctor attempted to remove her tumors in April 1900, performing the operation with her laid on the family dinner table, but she died during the procedure. The death was an emotional blow to Minton; thereafter, he refused to attend church and spoke against God, whom he blamed for his mother's death. Minton's father married Sarah Montague on December 3, 1901.|$|E
5|$|RE11 {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with FM 1929, {{to the north}} of a <b>small</b> <b>farm.</b> The roadway proceeds as a two-lane, paved road, traveling northward through rural areas on a large peninsula on the lake. The road continues north, traveling through scrub land before it intersects the Ray Stoker Jr. Highway, and bends slightly northeast for a short distance. After continuing north, the roadway bends northeast, as it intersects the former route of RM 2134. The highway intersects a small road leading to a residential community on the lake, before continuing northeast, where it intersects County Road 4763 (CR 4763), which leads to a small residential area. It turns north and continues for a short distance, after which the highway bends northwest, and proceeds to its northern terminus, a boat-launch ramp on the coast of the lake. The highway is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). No portion of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

From the early 80 s, {{with the introduction of}} the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP), the conditions of production and reproduction of <b>small</b> <b>farms</b> have radically changed. In addition to the unfavorable trend of the prices, these farms are increasingly excluded from credit, land and support services. The ultimate consequence is a tendency in real incomes to decline, particularly sharp for <b>small</b> <b>farms</b> in the arid regions of the country. Faced with this degradation, <b>small</b> <b>farms</b> have developed mechanisms of adaptation or regulation allowing them to survive and, even in certain cases, to ensure more than a simple reproduction.
