40|$|The {{addition}} of lime into soils {{has been widely}} used to stabilize the expansive sub-grade soils when the road pavements are constructed on them. It is common practice to apply a half of the required lime amount and allow a certain time period for lime to react with <b>soils</b> (<b>Amelioration</b> period) before applying the rest of lime and compacting the sub-grade. The optimum amelioration period is essential to minimize the construction delay and to gain the higher strength.

A soil mixed with a particular lime content was compacted at different amelioration periods (e. g. : 0, 6, 12, 18, 24 hrs) to obtain soil samples to measure the Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS). The results suggested that for a given amelioration period, UCS increased with the increase in lime content. The optimum amelioration period could be within 14 ~ 17 hours for most of the lime contents in tested soils.

40|$|Seaweed {{cultivation}} {{is a high}} {{growth industry}} that is primarily targeted at human food and hydrocolloid markets. However, seaweed biomass also offers a feedstock {{for the production of}} nutrient-rich biochar for <b>soil</b> <b>amelioration.</b> We provide the first data of biochar yield and characteristics from intensively cultivated seaweeds (Saccharina, Undaria and Sargassum - brown seaweeds, and Gracilaria, Kappaphycus and Eucheuma - red seaweeds). While there is some variability in biochar properties {{as a function of the}} origin of seaweed, there are several defining and consistent characteristics of seaweed biochar, in particular a relatively low C content and surface area but high yield, essential trace elements (N, P and K) and exchangeable cations (particularly K). The pH of seaweed biochar ranges from neutral (7) to alkaline (11), allowing for broad-spectrum applications in diverse soil types. We find that seaweed biochar is a unique material for <b>soil</b> <b>amelioration</b> that is consistently different to biochar derived from ligno-cellulosic feedstock.

40|$|Green {{seaweeds}} {{from the}} genus Ulva are a promising feedstock {{for the production}} of biochar for carbon (C) sequestration and <b>soil</b> <b>amelioration.</b> Ulva can be cultivated in waste water from land-based aquaculture and Ulva blooms ("green tides") strand millions of tons of biomass on coastal areas of Europe and China each year. The conversion of Ulva into biochar could recycle C and nutrients from eutrophic water into agricultural production. We produce biochar from Ulva ohnoi, cultivated in waste water from an aquaculture facility, and characterize its suitability for C sequestration and <b>soil</b> <b>amelioration</b> through bio-chemical analyses and plant growth experiments. Two biomass pre-treatments (fresh water rinsing to reduce salt, and pelletisation to increase density) were crossed with four pyrolysis temperatures (300 – 750 °C). Biomass rinsing decreased the ash and increased the C content of the resulting biochar. However, biochar produced from un-rinsed biomass had a higher proportion of fixed C and a higher yield. C sequestration decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperatures due to the combination of lower yield and lower total C content of biochar produced at high temperatures. Biochar produced from un-rinsed biomass at 300 °C had the greatest gravimetric C sequestration (110 – 120 g stable C kg− 1 seaweed). Biochar produced from un-pelletised Ulva enhanced plant growth three-fold in low fertility soils when the temperature of pyrolysis was less than 450 °C. The reduced effectiveness of the high-temperature biochars (> 450 °C) was due to a lower N and higher salt content. Soil ameliorated with biochar produced from pelletised biomass had suppressed plant germination and growth. The most effective biochar for C sequestration and <b>soil</b> <b>amelioration</b> was produced from un-rinsed and un-pelletised Ulva at 300 °C. The green tide that occurs annually along the Shandong coastline in China generates sufficient biomass (200, 000 tons dry weight) to ameliorate 12, 500 ha of soil, sequester 15, 000 t C and recycle 5500 t N into agriculture.

While {{there are a number}} of models that simulate reactive solute transport, UNSATCHEM and HYDRUS- 1 D are currently the only models that also include an ability to simulate the impacts of soil chemistry on hydraulic conductivity. Previous researchers have successfully applied these models to simulate amelioration experiments on a sodic loam soil.

An experiment on Lamnarai soils was statistical designed in split-split plot with 3 replications which main plots consisted of 1) without soil amendment and 2) amendment with 100 kg/rai of sulfur. Sub plots comprised clone 94 - 2 - 106 and LK 92 - 11 sugarcane variety. Sub sub plots were fertilizer application rates i. e. 0 - 6 - 6, 6 - 6 - 6, 12 - 6 - 6 and 18 - 6 - 6 kg N-P 2 O 5 -K 2 O/rai. Another experiment on Lop Burisoils was also designed in split-split plot with 3 replications which main plot comprised 1) without soil amendment and 2) amendment with 800 kg/rai of chicken manure. Sub plots were sugarcane varieties i. e. Khon Kaen 3 and LK 92 - 11. Sub sub plots were fertilizer application rates i. e. 0 - 6 - 6, 6 - 6 - 6, 12 - 6 - 6 and 18 - 6 - 6 kg N-P 2 O 5 -K 2 O/rai. The results showed that average yield of sugarcane grown on Lamnarai soils without <b>soil</b> <b>amelioration</b> was 25. 49 t/rai.

We have previously cultivated the freshwater macroalga Oedogonium at a coal-fired power station to treat a metal-contaminated effluent from that facility. We then produced biochar from this biomass and determined the suitability of both the biomass and the biochar for <b>soil</b> <b>amelioration.</b> The dried biomass of Oedogonium cultivated in the waste water contained several elements for which there are terrestrial biosolids criteria (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Se and Zn) and leached significant amounts of these elements into solution. Here, we demonstrate that these biomass leachates impair the germination and growth of radishes as a model crop. However, the biochar produced from this same biomass leaches negligible amounts of metal into solution and the leachates support high germination and growth of radishes. Biochar produced at 750 °C leaches the least metal and has the highest recalcitrant C content. When this biochar is added to a low-quality soil it improves the retention of nutrients (N, P, Ca, Mg, K and Mo) from fertilizer in the soil {{and the growth of}} radishes by 35 - 40 %. Radishes grown in the soils amended with the biochar have equal or lower metal contents than radishes grown in soil without biochar, but much higher concentrations of essential trace elements (Mo) and macro nutrients (P, K, Ca and Mg).

An attempt was made to rehabilitate sodic waste lands through the establishment of plant cover, with diverse plant communities within Banthra Research Station of the National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow, India (80 ° 45 ’- 53 ° 53 ’ E and 26 ° 40 ’- 26 ° 45 ’ N) for the last three decades. A rehabilitated forest ecosystem developed in this way consists in a number of herbs, shrubs and trees. Derris indica, Dalbergia sissoo, Azadirachta indica, Cassia siamea, Terminalia arjuna, Syzigium cumin were the dominant species in this rehabilitated forest, whereas Sporobolus, Desmostachya and Dactyloctenium were a common genera of grasses /forbs on a barren land. This study showed that species diversity and productivity significantly influenced the <b>soil</b> <b>amelioration</b> process. A comparison of three afforested sites with a varying degree of productivity and diversity indicated that some soil properties were influenced by diversity while others by productivity. Individual effects of diversity and productivity were classified as 42 % and respectively 58 %, in soil reclamation. A combined effect of both biomass productivity and species diversity contributed about 92 % towards amelioration. There was an appreciable reduction in soil pH and ESP (exchangeable sodium percentage) and an increase in organic C and N contents showing that sodicity has receded in the forested soil.

Reducing soil variability increases the chances of growing a uniform block of trees, which is essential for optimal productivity and efficient labour-use. This project aimed to determine a) {{if there is a}} relationship between soil zones defined by EM 38 mapping, and productivity in apple orchard blocks, and b) if a relationship does exist, investigate whether productivity might be improved by conducting EM 38 mapping prior to planting. EM 38 soil maps, soil samples and tree productivity maps were collected and analysed from two high-density orchard blocks in the Stanthorpe region of Queensland. The results showed existence of a broad relationship between EM 38 mapping zones and areas of high and low productivity in both blocks. Further data investigation and discussions with growers, suggested that use of the EM 38 soil maps, together with grower knowledge of the site history, would have likely led to improved <b>soil</b> <b>amelioration</b> work prior to planting and changes to block design.

40|$|Copyright 2008 Australian Society of AgronomyAn {{important}} {{proportion of}} crop production in South Australia {{is carried out}} on neutral-alkaline soils comprising infertile siliceous sands overlaying sodic subsoils. Crop growth {{is limited by the}} infertile nature of the non-wetting, rapidly draining upper soil horizons and also by the lower soil horizons which are generally dense sandy clays, often sodic and with poor physical structure. A replicated experiment was established at Stansbury, SA in 2004 to compare production under best district practice management with that from several ‘once off’ <b>soil</b> <b>amelioration</b> treatments; surface applied organic matter (composted pig bedding litter), three subsoil treatments involving deep ripping to 0. 4 m and addition of an ameliorant (either liquid nutrients, gypsum or organic matter as lupin grain), and a treatment that combined the surface and all the subsoil treatments together. Treatments were designed to improve soil chemical and physical properties and enhance root and crop growth. Of the treatments tested, deep ripping (0. 4 m) and associated placement of nutrients in fluid form provided the most consistent crop responses, with the response being greater where the clay was closer to the surface. Some crop responses to the once off subsoil amelioration were still evident after 4 crops. Differences in crop water use (evapotranspiration) were not apparent from gravimetric measurements at sowing and harvest suggesting that other soil chemical and physical properties may be responsible for the yield responses, or there may have been undetected differences in the partitioning of water use between evaporation and transpiration within seasons.

The participatory approach is applied in the RECARE (Preventing and Remediating degradation of soils in Europe through Land Care) project case study of Timpaki, a semiarid region in south-central Crete (Greece) where the main land use is horticulture in greenhouses irrigated by groundwater. Excessive groundwater abstractions {{have resulted in a}} drop of the groundwater level in the coastal part of the aquifer, thus leading to seawater intrusion and in turn to soil salinisation. The documented technologies are evaluated for their impacts on ecosystem services, cost, and input requirements using a participatory approach and field evaluations. Results show that technologies which promote maintaining existing crop types while enhancing productivity and decreasing soil salinity are preferred by the stakeholders. The evaluation concludes that rainwater harvesting is the optimal solution for direct soil salinity mitigation, as it addresses a wider range of ecosystem and human well-being benefits. Nevertheless, this merit is offset by poor financial motivation making agronomic measures more attractive to users...|$|R

Heavy metal concentrations in the compost were also examined to assess the potential health implication of compost application in urban and peri-urban agriculture. It was observed that the overall NPK concentration was low in the different compost types, but generally, total N and K were greater in agricultural waste compost compared to municipal solid waste (MSW) composts. The agricultural waste compost was also richer in organic carbon. In terms of toxicity concerns, heavy metals concentrations (Ni, Zn, Cu and Cd) were generally low in the different types of composts and within permissible Australian standards for compost products. However, lead (Pb) concentration in mixed MSW composts was significantly high in the dry season, exceeding the Australian limit of 150 mg/kg Pb, required for unrestricted compost use. There was considerable seasonal variation in the heavy metal levels in the composts made from open windrows process, with reduced levels in the rainy season. It appeared that seasons affected mixed waste characteristics, which affected compost quality. It was therefore concluded that seasons and composting processes, to some extent, were important determinants of the levels of toxic metal concentrations in final compost products in Ghana. Key words: Solid waste Compost Plant macro-nutrients Heavy metals Ghan...|$|R
40|$|As a {{promising}} pyrolysis product for mitigating climate changes, biochar can be remained in soil for thousands years after field application. The positive benefits of biochar amendment into soil include crop yield increase, soil fertility improvement and water-holding capacity enhancement. The {{objective of this}} study is to quantify specific stability of the biochar by screening the relative documents towards directions including feedstock classification, biochar preparation, unique stability, etc. Finally three types of methods were summarized, such as indirect measurement methods, direct measurement methods and molecule properties methods for biochar stability, which resulted from various production conditions and feedstocks. Wide range of biochar feedstocks and specific stability of biochar preparation required new evaluation mechanism in order to evaluate prospect of biochar production process and relative <b>soil</b> <b>amelioration</b> and limitation with multiple perspectives...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This review {{summarizes}} the early effects and responses of low doses of UV-B {{at the molecular}} level. {{in the case of}} four bean cultivars from Romania. The DNA molecules of the plant cells are damaged by UV due to the formation of different photoproducts. such as cyclobutane- pyrimidine dimers. (CPDs). which in turn can be combated by specialized photoreactivating enzyme systems. The investigation were done by using ELISA with specific monoclonal antibodies. CPDs formation increased during UV-B exposure. and photorepair led to descrease. The choice of Phaseolus vulgaris as biological material for investigations. {{can be explained by the}} importance of seeds and legumes in humans nutrition. being considered since centuries the poor peoples “meat” because of the increased level of high quality proteins. and the high energetically level. and due to the importance in <b>soil</b> <b>amelioration.</b> being used as very good previous culture plant for many other species...|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} {{of the influence of}} soil chemistry on soil hydraulic properties is of critical importance for the management of sodic soils under irrigation. The hydraulic conductivity of sodic soils {{has been shown to be}} affected by properties of the applied solution including pH (Suarez et al. 1984), sodicity and salt concentration (McNeal and Coleman 1966). The changes in soil hydraulic conductivity are the result of changes in the spacing between clay layers in response to changes in soil solution chemistry. While the importance o f soil chemistry in controlling hydraulic conductivity is known, the exact impacts of sodic <b>soil</b> <b>amelioration</b> on hydraulic conductivity and deep drainage at a given location are difficult to predict. This is because the relationships between soil chemical factors and hydraulic conductivity are soil specific and because local site specific factors also need to be considered to determine the actual impacts on deep drainage rates...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the contribution}} of private forestry to the global rural economy of a less favored area in the Italian Appenninnes. Recent studies carried out on such areas have indicated that forestry is often carried out with purposes other than purely financial ones, for example for their contribution to the total family income and their role in providing an opportunity for employing a labour force that would have otherwise been idle. In doing so, forestry also produces indirect economic benefits, for example the protection of <b>soils,</b> recreation and <b>amelioration</b> of landscape. After evaluating the extent of {{the contribution of}} forestry to the total family income, the paper attempts {{to assess the impact of}} the abandonment of the forestry activity according to a shadow price approach of forestry labour. This is done through a Linear Programming model carried out on a regional basis...|$|R
40|$|Five ectomycorrhizal fungi, Pisolithus tinctorius, Thelephora terrestris, Cenococcum geophilum, Hymenogaster sp. and Scleroderma sp., {{which were}} {{demonstrated}} previously {{to be capable}} of forming ectomycorrhizas with some pine, eucalypt and fagaceous tree species were grown in vitro in liquid cultures for 3 weeks at six different concentrations of nine heavy metals, aluminium, iron, copper, zinc, nickel, cadmium, chromium, lead and mercury. Measurements of mean mycelial dry weight yields indicated that the local isolates of Hymenogaster sp. and Scleroderma sp., as well as the introduced fungal species P. tinctorius, were able to withstand high concentrations of Al, Fe, Cu and Zn and might, therefore, have potential for revegetation schemes in metal-contaminated <b>soils.</b> The metal <b>amelioration</b> mechanism in the metal-tolerant fungal species P. tinctorius was observed to involve extrahyphal slime and, as demonstrated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, was achieved by polyphosphate linkage of Cu and Zn. postprin...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} soil {{chemical}} changes on soybean root growth, mineral nutrition and grain yield, {{as a result}} of surface application of lime under no-till (NT), are still under discussion. A field trial was carried out on a loamy dystrophic Typic Hapludox at Ponta Grossa, Paraná State, Brazil, using a completely randomized block design with three replicates, in a split-plot experiment. The main plots received four dolomitic lime rates applied on the surface (0, 2, 4, and 6 Mg ha- 1) in July 1993. In the subplots, two dolomitic lime rates were reapplied on the surface (0 and 3 Mg ha- 1) in June 2000. After nine years, liming increased pH, exchangeable Ca 2 + and reduced exchangeable Al 3 + as well as soil Al 3 + saturation down to a 60 cm depth. Re-liming, after two years, also provided <b>soil</b> acidity <b>amelioration</b> to a 60 cm depth. Soybean total root length per soil surface area (0 - 60 cm) decreased with the surface lime application under NT. The reduction in soil exchangeable Al 3 + with liming did not change Al concentrations in the soybean roots and leaves. Surface-applied dolomitic lime under NT brought an increase in Ca and Mg concentrations and a decrease in the Mn level in both soybean roots and leaves. Soybean grain yield was not influenced by surface liming because of the decreased Al toxicity and because root growth was stimulated by soil acidity stress under NT...|$|R
