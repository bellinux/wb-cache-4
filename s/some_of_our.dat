5|$|Our dream {{began in}} the hearts of the {{students}} at Martin Luther King, Jr., Elementary School nearly ten years ago. The dream was nurtured by the late state Senator Bill McCoy, and through the donations of Oregonians and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> state's most respected businesses; we will have an original work of art honoring the memory and ideals of one of America's greatest leaders.|$|E
25|$|According to Gray, {{this plan}} was first put into action {{when he had}} a meeting with Vernon Walters, then deputy {{director}} of the CIA, in which he quotes Walters as falsely saying, “If the investigation gets pushed further south of the border… it could trespass onto <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> covert projects. Since you’ve got these five men under arrest, it will be best to taper the matter off here.” This conversation implicitly stated that the FBI should not interview Manuel Ogarrio and Kenneth Dahlberg, individuals connected with the money used to fund the Watergate burglars.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversial}} {{issue is the}} extent to which human behaviours resemble animal communication, or whether all such communication has disappeared as a result of our linguistic capacity. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> bodily features—eyebrows, beards and moustaches, deep adult male voices, perhaps female breasts—strongly resemble adaptations to producing signals. Ethologists such as Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt have argued that facial gestures such as smiling, grimacing, and the eyebrow flash on greeting are universal human communicative signals that can be related to corresponding signals in other primates. Given how recently spoken language has emerged, it is very likely that human body language does include some more or less involuntary responses that have a similar origin to the communication we have.|$|E

25|$|At least <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> {{behaviour}} must {{be influenced}} by our genes because behaviour depends on the interaction of molecules and neurons in the brain. These interactions {{are a result of}} our genes code, however the influence on behaviour cannot go much further than this. Dawkins likened genes to a computer. They have been pre-programmed to build cells, develop cells and make them work together. Like a computer, the hardware is set in stone, but the software can change how they work, just like our environment. Genes indirectly influence our behaviour as the nervous system and our brain is the intermediary in the transaction decision because it reasons and processes all of the gene instructions into one decision, movement or behaviour. The way our neurons connect is dependent on the environment, learning and experience. This introduces the nurture side of the nature nurture debate.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the show}} started airing, Q posed for several {{billboard}} posters. However, they {{were met with}} some controversy for being revealing, and several locations across the United States, including in areas of Chicago, Los Angeles and New York, refused {{to allow them to}} be put up, as they were located near churches and schools.

The band played mostly blues and ballads, but the most popular music among whites in the area was country. Berry wrote, [...] "Curiosity provoked me to lay {{a lot of our}} country stuff on our predominantly black audience and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> black audience began whispering 'who is that black hillbilly at the Cosmo?'

500|$|General William Westmoreland, {{who was the}} U.S. Army {{commander}} in South Vietnam, Taylor, and other senior U.S. officers in Saigon and Washington, D.C. urged President Lyndon B. Johnson to authorize reprisal bombings against North Vietnam. Taylor messaged Washington on Christmas Day, saying, [...] "Hanoi will get the word that, despite our present tribulations, there is still bite in the tiger they call paper, and the U.S. stock {{in this part of}} the world will take sharp rise. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> local squabbles will probably disappear in enthusiasm which our action would generate." [...] Taylor recommended that the US take unilateral action, citing the animosity between himself and Khanh's junta.|$|E
500|$|The odor of {{the flesh}} and latex may range from indistinct to pungent or turnip-like in age; the taste is {{strongly}} acrid—so much {{that it may have}} an anesthetizing effect in the throat. In his original description of the species, Peck reported [...] "An experiment of its edible qualities was made without any evil consequences." [...] Thorough cooking removes the bitter taste, but the mushroom is not highly regarded as an edible, and as Hesler and Smith have noted [...] "... but even with this compensating feature <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> acquaintances have found it rather undesirable (and indigestible)." [...] The mushroom is sold at traditional markets in Puebla, Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Swift's {{other works}} were {{previous}} {{collected in a}} four-volume set edited by Alexander Pope called Miscellanies, but Swift {{wanted to have a}} [...] "proper" [...] edition of his works. Some critics speculate that Swift turned to having his work printed without public sponsorship because he was afraid of breaking his commitments to Pope and his publisher Motte. Regardless of what Swift {{may or may not be}} planning, he wrote to Motte in December 1732 and said: [...] "I have cause to believe that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> printers will collected all they think to be mine, and print them by subscription, which I will never encourage nor oppose." ...|$|E

500|$|The Championships {{were at risk}} {{of decline}} when in 2008 the Rotary Club {{declared}} that its members were simply too old to stage an annual event of its size. The Sinodun president, David Caswell stated: [...] "The trouble {{is there is a}} lot of heavy work staging the event. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> members are over 70, and it was just getting too much". However, the Rotary Club of Oxford Spires declared that its members would continue hosting the event, thus preserving the competition for future generations. The President of Oxford Spires for 2008–2009, Liz Williamson, stressed that it should continue as the event was popular locally and demonstrated quirky English nature to a worldwide audience.|$|E
500|$|Wolfenstein: The New Order only {{features}} a single-player mode. The team felt that dividing focus and resources across both a single-player and an online multiplayer mode {{would be less}} efficient. When questioned {{about the lack of}} an online multiplayer mode, Öjerfors explained that the decision was simple. [...] "If we could take every bit of energy and sweat the studio has and pour all that into the single-player campaign, it gives us the resources to make something very, very cool, compared to if we would also have to divert <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> resources to making multiplayer." [...] Executive producer Jerk Gustafsson attributed the choice to the style of game the team is familiar with, stating that MachineGames is [...] "a single-player studio".|$|E
500|$|The Santa Fe National Forest's rocky {{terrain and}} steep {{inclines}} proved difficult for conventional camera equipment—such as cranes and dollies—which resulted {{in much of}} the film's scenes being shot by the camera operators, who were rigged to aerial ski lifts above the action. [...] "The location we picked was on top of the ski area above 12,000 feet in Santa Fe, and the high altitude made it extremely physically demanding", Schleissler explained. [...] "All our equipment had to be hand-carried into <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> remote locations, which meant we had to limit ourselves to the bare minimum...No one ever hiked to the set empty-handed, including our producers. It was one big team effort that made us a close film family." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] is a {{performance}} piece, {{inspired by the}} title sequence from David Fincher's 1995 movie Se7en. The clip was shot in just four hours entirely within a warehouse decorated with plexiglas sheets on which the song lyrics were written. Bayer cut the film into pieces, and soaked it in his bath, applying deliberate fingerprints and abrasions to the footage before putting it back together by hand. Vig would compliment the video for mirroring the band's sound: [...] "some of it looked beautiful, some of it looked distorted, and kinda fucked up - and it sorta described <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> music visually". Bayer later re-edited a second version of the video, with alternative footage from the original shoot for a remix version of [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] by Todd Terry.|$|E
500|$|A {{great many}} {{intelligent}} persons tolerate or encourage our fake natural history {{on the ground}} that they find it entertaining, and that it interests the school-children in the wild life about them. Is the truth, then, without value for its own sake? What would these good people think of a United States school history that took the same liberties with facts that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> nature writers do: that, for instance, made Washington take his army over the Delaware in balloons, or in sleighs on the solid ice with bands playing; or that made Lincoln a victim of the Evil Eye; or that portrayed his slayer as a self-sacrificing hero; or that represented the little Monitor that eventful day on Hampton Roads as diving under the Merrimac and tossing it ashore on its beak? ...|$|E
500|$|Carter also {{directed}} the episode; initially, the episode {{was supposed to}} have been helmed by another individual, but no one was ever selected. At the last minute, Carter took on the role. Due to time constraints, Carter was writing whole parts of the script while the episode was being filmed. Many of the cast and crew were pleased with Carter's directing. Gillian Anderson said that she thought [...] "Chris has directed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> best episodes. He's very even tempered, and he's quiet and gentle and quite nice to have as a director, because that energy can't help but pervade the rest of the set [...] He's got a clear vision, and he's good at communicating that." [...] Annabeth Gish noted that Carter's directing was [...] "very meticulous" [...] and that he [...] "knows exactly what he wants".|$|E
