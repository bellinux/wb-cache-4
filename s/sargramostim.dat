The intestinal inflammation in IBD is controlled by a complex interplay of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. Innate immunity comprises a set of distinct elements, which includes circulating cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and resident intestinal immune cells (dendritic and Paneth cells), as well as intestinal epithelium and cellular products, including antimicrobial peptides such as defensins and cathelicidins. Different components of innate immunity in IBD have been suggested to be defective or impaired. The human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and the human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) have emerged as potential tools for the modulation of intestinal inflammation and repair.

40|$|Malignant {{melanoma}} is {{a growing}} problem {{with more and more}} people in Sweden and the world suffering from this cancer. Malignant melanoma is a disease that when discovered in time can be treated successfully with surgical methods, but the real challenge lies in treating the disease after its spread. Treatment in the past for advanced malignant melanoma has been unsuccessful with no positive effect on overall survival. However, {{in the last couple of}} years, new treatment has arrived with focus on priming the immune system to eradicate the tumors. One new drug is the CTLA- 4 inhibitor ipilimumab that is given as intravenous infusion. CTLA- 4 is a protein located on regulatory T-cells and that is upregulated on activated cytotoxic T-cells. This protein mediates an inhibitory signal that attenuates T-cell-activation.   Treatment with the CTLA- 4 inhibitor has been shown to increase overall survival. However, not much is known about how well ipilimumab synergizes with other drugs used for treatment of malignant melanoma.   This is a literature study with the aim to evaluate if ipilimumab is used best as monotherapy or if it is of better use as part of a combination therapy. Search was made in PubMed with the key-words "Ipilimumab", "Ipilimumab treatment", CTLA- 4 inhibitor" and "treatment malignant melanoma”. Six articles were chosen and each of these analyzed the effect of ipilimumab alone or combined with other agents against malignant melanoma.   The combination of ipilimumab and the alkylating agent dacarbazine was shown to have a better impact on overall survival compared with monotherapy with dacarbazine, but this combination also showed an increase in serious adverse events. Ipilimumab also showed to work in synergy with both the PD- 1 -inhibitor nivolumab and the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) <b>sargramostim.</b> Combination with <b>sargramostim</b> was also shown to decrease the amount of serious adverse events. Combination with a gp 100 peptide vaccine failed to show any positive effects on overall survival. Also prophylactic treatment with budesonide showed no further gain in overall survival. The effect of ipilimumab was found to have a dose-ranging effect, with higher dose treatment having a better effect but also with more serious adverse events.   The results of this literature study showed that ipilimumab has a better effect with higher dose and that it can work in synergy with other agents such as nivolumab and <b>sargramostim.</b> Results also showed that occurring adverse effects during treatment with ipilimumab may be treated with systemic glucocorticoids that did not affect the tumor-killing ability of ipilimumab. These results should be evaluated in bigger studies and with longer follow up time...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a tumor-associated enzyme {{critical}} for DNA replication and main 5 ′-fluorouracil (5 ′-FU) target. TSPP/VAC 1 is a multi-arm trial phase-Ib trial program aimed {{to investigate the}} toxicity and biomodulatory activity of a poly-epitope-peptide vaccine to TS (TSPP) in cancer patients (pts). Here, we present {{the results of the}} TSPP/VAC 1 /arm C trial aimed to evaluate TSPP in combination with chemo-immunotherapy in pretreated metastatic colo-rectal cancer (mCRC) pts. Twenty-nine pts, 14 males and 15 females, received poly-chemotherapy with gemcitabine [GEM; 1, 000  mg/sqm, day- 1], oxaliplatin [OX; 80  mg/sqm, day- 2], levofolinate [100  mg/sqm, days 1 – 2], bolus/infusional 5 ′-FU [400  mg/ 800  mg/sqm, days 1 – 2], <b>sargramostim</b> [50  μg, days 3 – 7 /q 30], and interleukin- 2 [sc. 0. 5 MIU twice a day, days 8 – 14 / 18 – 30] [GOLFIG-regimen]. Seventeen pts received sc. TSPP injections at escalating dosage [3 pts, 100  µg (DL- 1); 3 pts, 200  µg (DL- 2) and 11 pts, 300  µg (DL- 3) ] one week after each chemotherapy cycle (concomitant module), while 10 out 12 pts received TSPP (300  µg) after 12 GOLFIG courses [dose level (DL) - 0] (sequential module). TSPP MTD was not achieved. Adverse events consisted in swelling/erythema at injection sites (17 cases), G 1 – 2 haematological (16 cases) and gastro-enteric events (12), fever, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and poly-arthralgia and rise in auto-antibodies [ANA, ENA, c-ANCA, p-ANCA in the DL 1 – 3 pts]. Both treatment-modules showed immunomodulating and antitumor activity (disease-control-rate, DL 1 – 3 and DL 0 were 70. 6 % and 83. 3 %, respectively) with a better survival recorded in the second group [median OS DL 1 – 3  vs. DL 0 = 8  vs. 16  mo, p = 0. 049].

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{randomized}} multicenter {{study was}} designed to compare the activity of a high-dose doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy regimen with a conventional standard-dose regimen in adult patients with advanced soft tissue sarcomas (ASTS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1992 and 1995, 314 patients were randomized to receive a standard-dose regimen (arm A), containing doxorubicin (50 mg/m(2) on day 1) and ifosfamide (5 g/m(2) on day 1), or an intensified regimen (arm B), combining doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2) on day 1), the same ifosfamide dose, and recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF; <b>sargramostim,</b> 250 microgram/m(2) on days 3 to 16); all courses were repeated every 3 weeks. RESULTS: The median age of the 294 eligible patients was 50 years. They received a median of five chemotherapy cycles. The median dose and relative doxorubicin dose-intensity achieved were 245 mg and 97 % in arm A and 360 mg and 99 % in arm B, respectively. Thirty-eight percent and 23 % of patients presented with leiomyosarcomas and liver metastases, respectively. Objective responses were observed in 31 (21 %) of 147 assessable patients in arm A and in 31 (23. 3 %) of 133 in arm B (P =. 65). No change was observed in 41. 6 % and 46. 2 % of patients in arm A and B, respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in the intensive arm (P =. 03). The median duration of the time to progression was 19 weeks in the conventional arm and 29 weeks in the intensified arm. There was no difference in overall survival (P =. 98) between the two therapeutic arms. Toxicities were manageable in both arms. A grade 3 / 4 neutropenia and infection occurred in 92 % and 4. 6 % of patients in arm A, respectively, and in 90 % and 16. 6 % in arm B, respectively. Grade 3 / 4 thrombocytopenia was more frequent in arm B. CONCLUSION: The use of rhGM-CSF allowed safe escalation of chemotherapy doses. Despite a 50 % increase of the doxorubicin dose-intensity, the high-dose regimen failed to demonstrate any impact on survival in patients with ASTS. The low complete response rate, the high incidence of leiomyosarcomas, and liver metastases may in part explain these results. However, the lengthening of the PFS in the intensive arm, because of the quality of stable disease and inappropriate tumor evaluation policies that potentially lead to an underestimation of antitumor activity, does not definitively refute the use of a high-dose chemotherapy regimen in selected patients with ASTS. status: publishe...|$|E
