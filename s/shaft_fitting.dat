40|$|AbstractCurrent {{methods of}} <b>shaft</b> <b>fitting</b> are only {{partially}} successful at matching players with optimal equipment. This {{could be due}} to player adaptation. Twenty-four players hit drives into a net with clubs of different shaft flexes. This was repeated with vibration applied. Club kinematics were stable across flex conditions with no vibration, and it is probable that players varied the application of torques during the downswing to compensate for changes in club mechanics. With vibration, for eleven players, club head speed and grip speed at impact increased with flex. This suggests these players could not apply desired torques, perhaps due to noise in proprioceptive feedback caused by vibration...|$|E
40|$|AbstractClub fitting and {{especially}} the customization of the shaft is {{a major issue in}} golf. <b>Shaft</b> <b>fitting</b> commonly uses a set of material parameters (i. e. bending stiffness) and dynamic parameters determined during the golf swing. However subjective parameters, such as impact sensation are not much considered. N= 20 young male players with a handicap of 0 - 10 took part in a pairwise comparison experiment (Böhm, Krämer and Senner, 2009) rating the perceived sensation of four different drivers (same club head but different in shaft weight and flexibility). Each subject performed a total of 36 shots of which the quality was quantified using club head speed, repeatability, reached distance and achieved accuracy of the shot. Correlation between subjective and objective data was calculated and ANOVA was performed to analyze for differences between the four clubs with respect to the above quality criteria. No {{significant differences were found between}} the four drivers what concerns club head velocity (average of 117. 8 mph). However higher shot quality and better shot sensation have been achieved (p< 0. 05) when using the two regular (softer) shafts compared to two stiff shafts. It is concluded that the achievable club head velocity seems to be inappropriate as single criterion for individual <b>shaft</b> <b>fitting.</b> This scientific investigation clearly shows the benefit of a holistic club-fitting method including subjective issues. It disproves the widespread theory “The faster you swing, the stiffer your shaft should be” (Wishon and Grundner, 2008, p.   25) and reveals new aspects to consider in club fitting...|$|E

Prosauropods and basal sauropods have metacarpals which are articulated at the base, but this is further developed in neosauropods such that the articulation continues down the shafts. The ends of the metacarpals also form a tight arch with wedge-shaped <b>shafts</b> <b>fitting</b> closely together.|$|R
40|$|The sensing of {{the rotor}} {{position}} for Switched Reluctance (SR) motor {{is necessary for}} excitation control so as to obtain the best performance. The rotor position for SR motor control has usually been measured using a physical rotor position transducer attached to the rotor <b>shaft.</b> The <b>fitting</b> of a rotor position transducer on an SR motor requires additional electrical connections and additional cost, {{it is also a}} potential source of unreliability. Considerable attention has recently been applied to various methods for sensorless rotor position measurement, generally based on measurement of phase current and flux and a preknowledge of the magnetic characteristics. This paper presents two methods which deduce sensorless rotor position information by monitoring the actual excitation signals of the motor phases. This is done without the injection of diagnostic current pulses and has the advantages that the measured current is large and mutual effects from other phases are negligible. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{calibration}} {{system was}} developed for golf <b>shaft</b> <b>fitting</b> to the club or blade. The system provided the best line and angle of golf shaft {{to fit into the}} club slot. This yielded the best controlling for the impact point between the club and the golf ball, including obtained the minimal swaying of golf shaft after the club hit to the ball. The proposed system was consisted of two components: the hardest line tuning and the best line calibration tool. The hardest line tuning was applied to search for the line that indicated the most strongest of the shaft, which contributed the minimal bend within the given certain forced pressure. The best line calibration tool was employed to determine the best angle for fitting the shaft to the golf club which reflected the minimal swaying while hitting to the ball. In this manner, the golfers could control the desired range and direction of the ball...|$|E

Application of alumunium 6061 {{can be found in}} many manufacturing industries such as aircraft and aerospace components, marine fittings, transport, bicycle frames, camera lenses, drive, <b>shafts,</b> electrical <b>fittings</b> and connectors, brake components, valves, couplings. But some of the limitations during machining of aluminum 6061 are lower strength at elevated temperatures and limited formability affects quality of desired output. A lot of parameters that affect the turning operation are vibration, tool wear, surface roughness etc. Among this surface roughness plays a major role which affects the quality in the manufacturing process. This paper {{presents the}} effect of process parameter by considering the Spindle speed, Feed rate and Depth of cut. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} predict the surface roughness. Aluminium 6061 is taken into a consideration, machining is done by using coated carbide tool.

5000|$|By the mid 20th Century the use {{of water}} mills had {{declined}} dramatically. In 1938, an investigation by Rex Wailes discovered that of the 23 extant tidal mills in England, only 10 were still working by their own motive power. Of {{one of the few}} remaining by the 1940s, at Beaulieu, H. J. Massingham wrote, [...] "Part of the mill is built on piles into the riverand is weatherboarded, while the rest of the building is a warm red brick roofed with lozenge-shaped and rounded tiles which I believe are called fish-tiles. All the interior is of wood - ladders, bins for the meal, floor-boarding, square pillars, beams, narrow passages, <b>fittings,</b> <b>shaft</b> rising to the first floor and all. So ramshackle is the arrangement of the props and supports that it is a wonder that the whole edifice does not tumble about the miller's ears like a pack of cards. The point is that it has stood in this way for something like six centuries, and that gives the explorer into its dusky depths a more penetrating notion of how the old builders could build, more than does a Gothic church or even a cathedral. The pulse and swing of the great wheel sets the whole building in an ague, but it will still be standing when all the flimsy excrescences of development between Beaulieu and Poole have fallen down." ...|$|R
40|$|A tool was {{developed}} to repair or replace AN fittings on the shuttle external tank (ET). (The AN thread {{is a type of}} fitting used to connect flexible hoses and rigid metal tubing that carry fluid. It is a U. S. military-derived specification agreed upon by the Army and Navy, hence AN.) The tool is used on a drill and is guided by a pilot shaft that follows the inside bore. The cutting edge of the tool is a standard-size replaceable insert. In the typical Post Launch Maintenance/Repair process for the AN fittings, the six fittings are removed from the ET's GUCP (ground umbilical carrier plate) for reconditioning. The fittings are inspected for damage to the sealing surface per standard operations maintenance instructions. When damage is found on the sealing surface, the condition is documented. A new AN reconditioning tool is set up to cut and remove the surface damage. It is then inspected to verify the fitting still meets drawing requirements. The tool features a cone-shaped interior at 36. 5, and may be adjusted at a precise angle with go-no-go gauges to insure that the cutting edge could be adjusted as it wore down. One tool, one setting block, and one go-no-go gauge were fabricated. At the time of this reporting, the tool has reconditioned/returned to spec 36 AN fittings with 100 -percent success of no leakage. This tool provides a quick solution to repair a leaky AN fitting. The tool could easily be modified with different-sized pilot <b>shafts</b> to different-sized <b>fittings...</b>|$|R
40|$|Scana-Booforge is a Swedish {{company which}} {{specialize}} in heat treatment of various metal. The treatments {{take place in}} quenching ovens, where fans are used to circulate the hot air. The fans used today {{do not have a}} satisfactory lifespan. This thesis aims to develop a new design of the fans for the quenching ovens, and the goal is that the new fans will bring cost savings for Scana-Booforge. The design development process started with mapping out the environment in which the fans operate, and with analysis of the existing fan structure and damages, in order to establish the cause of failure and of short durability. The performance of the fan were also established at this stage. A specific cost index was developed to allow for comparison between the existing structure and the new design. The specific cost index is based on cost through lifespan. With knowledge of the existing fan performance it was then possible to set requirements for the new fan. Thereafter a number of concepts were generated. The concept that met the requirements best was then selected for further analysis, and optimization, in order to obtain an optimal design, regarding lifespan and capacity (that is the fans ability to circulate air). The developed design is composed of a lathed fan shaft and a twisted rotor blade. The components are joined together by welding. The rotor blade has a length of 600 mm, and thickness of 5 mm. It is twisted 45 ° in opposite directions at each end. The rotor blade weight is of about 2. 6 kg, and together with the shaft the weigh is of about 20. 8 kg. The new fan design meets the set requirements. In comparison to the existing fan the new design has an estimated lower cost per hour of operation, increased capacity and it retains the <b>shaft</b> dimensions for <b>fitting</b> to the existing driving shaft. By calculation, the cost saving is also established...|$|R
50|$|As {{built the}} Britannic {{incorporated}} a novel system which allowed the single propeller {{to be raised}} and lowered while still connected to its shaft and without stopping the engine. This was acheived with a flexible coupling and an elongated aperture in the ship's sternpost. This feature {{was an attempt to}} overcome the disadvantage of long-hulled single-screw liners, which pitched in heavy seas. In bad weather the stern could rise enough to lift the propeller partially out of the water, reducing thrust and causing unpleasant vibration. The Britannic's adjustable propeller was angled below the horizontal when in the lowest position, to ensure the entire propeller remained submerged. In shallow water the shaft could be raised to the horizontal or slightly upwards to reduce the ship's draught and prevent a blade striking the seabed. With the propeller fully raised the entire propeller hub and one blade could be accessed without placing the ship in dry dock - it was hoped this would reduce the cost and time required to change any broken propeller blades. The shaft was raised and lowered by a small auxiliar steam engine in the ship's stern, operating rods connected to a bearing collar on the propeller shaft via a worm drive reduction gear. The system proved reliable and effective at its purpose of keeping the propeller submerged in heavy weather but when set at certain angles the flexible coupling caused heavy vibration and the equipment required significantly more maintenance than a standard drive system. It also reduced the efficiency of the propeller in calm weather unless the angle was adjusted to be perfectly parallel to the line of the hull, making Britannic slower than her conventionally-built sistership, the Germanic. In 1875, after less than year in service, Britannic was taken out of service to be refitted with the same propeller arrangement as her sister - this work required not only removing the propeller mechanism and installing a new drive <b>shaft</b> but also <b>fitting</b> a new bed for the main engine to change its alignment. Once the ship was back in service her performance matched that of the Germanic, allowing the ship to make its own attempts at the Blue Riband.|$|R
5000|$|Gt. Fransham towermill was a four-storey mill {{that stood}} at Mill Farm {{described}} as a very wide-towered Mill, not very high, but thick & heavily built. The mill used four patent sails to power two pairs of French burr stones. A pulley wheel was set onto {{the outside of the}} mill to allow auxiliary power via a belt from a steam engine. In 1886, two windmills were advertised to be let, along with a bake office on the same site.The Mill had a history of tragedy. The Norfolk News of 10 February 1866 reported On Thursday in last week a distressing accident accompanied by a fatal termination occurred in Mr. Perkins’ mill, the unfortunate victim being a respectable & steady married man in his service, named Crispin Howard. About ten minutes before eleven in the forenoon Mr. Perkins left the deceased following his usual avocation. On his return shortly after eleven, Mr. Perkins thought the mill was not working so smoothly as before he left & on looking upwards he discovered the lifeless body of his workman resting on the beam to which he had been elevated after having been drawn in & passed between the two cog wheels. From the nature of the wounds inflicted, it was obvious death must have been instantaneous. The dead man who was fifty five years of age leaves a widow & three children to mourn his loss & for whom much sympathy is felt. At the inquest held on Saturday, the only verdict that could be found in the circumstances was returned - that of [...] "Accidental death".Just a few years later The King's Lynn Advertiser reported in April 1874 that Jonathan Perkins, miller of Gt Fransham was fatally injured on being thrown out of a pony cart when it hit a gatepost.By {{the early part of the}} 20th century, the end had come for Great Fransham Mill.The Dereham & Fakenham Times - 28 August 1909 reported the sale of the mill by auction at the George Hotel, East Dereham, on 23 August 1909.Mr. Heyhoe next offered the substantial built brick tower windmill situate at the Mill Farm, Great Fransham. This contained patent sails, two pairs of stones, <b>shafting</b> gear and <b>fittings</b> in good order and were sold subject to being removed from the occupation by 11 October next, from instructions from the trustees of Court 1246 A. O. F. (Swaffham). Mr. Crane was the purchaser for £7. This was the Crane family who owned the wagon works at Gt Fransham.|$|R
40|$|A {{method has}} been devised {{to enable the}} {{fabrication}} of lightweight pressure vessels from multilayer composite materials. This method is related to, but not the same as, the method described in gMaking a Metal- Lined Composite-Overwrapped Pressure Vessel h (MFS- 31814), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 29, No. 3 (March 2005), page 59. The method is flexible in that it poses no major impediment to changes in tank design and is applicable {{to a wide range}} of tank sizes. The figure depicts a finished tank fabricated by this method, showing layers added at various stages of the fabrication process. In the first step of the process, a mandrel that defines the size and shape of the interior of the tank is machined from a polyurethane foam or other suitable lightweight tooling material. The mandrel is outfitted with metallic end <b>fittings</b> on a <b>shaft.</b> Each end <b>fitting</b> includes an outer flange that has a small step to accommodate a thin layer of graphite/epoxy or other suitable composite material. The outer surface of the mandrel (but not the fittings) is covered with a suitable release material. The composite material is filament- wound so as to cover the entire surface of the mandrel from the step on one end fitting to the step on the other end fitting. The composite material is then cured in place. The entire workpiece is cut in half in a plane perpendicular to the axis of symmetry at its mid-length point, yielding two composite-material half shells, each containing half of the foam mandrel. The halves of the mandrel are removed from within the composite shells, then the shells are reassembled and bonded together with a belly band of cured composite material. The resulting composite shell becomes a mandrel for the subsequent steps of the fabrication process and remains inside the final tank. The outer surface of the composite shell is covered with a layer of material designed to be impermeable by the pressurized fluid to be contained in the tank. A second step on the outer flange of each end fitting accommodates this layer. Depending on the application, this layer could be, for example, a layer of rubber, a polymer film, or an electrodeposited layer of metal. If the fluid to be contained in the tank is a gas, then the best permeation barrier is electrodeposited metal (typically copper or nickel), which can be effective at a thickness of as little as 0. 005 in (. 0. 13 mm). The electrodeposited metal becomes molecularly bonded to the second step on each metallic end fitting. The permeation-barrier layer is covered with many layers of filament-wound composite material, which could be the same as, or different from, the composite material of the inner shell. Finally, the filament-wound composite material is cured in an o...|$|R
