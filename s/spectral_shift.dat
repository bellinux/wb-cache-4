Such results suggest that PEGylating NPs can be utilized as a method for mitigating changes to NPs’ spectral profiles; however, we also find that PEGylation does not completely prevent <b>spectral</b> <b>shifting</b> and broadening, and that the extent of <b>spectral</b> <b>shifting</b> and broadening is time- and exposure dose-dependent (Fig.  2).|$|R

30|$|When {{plasmonic}} nanoparticles (NPs) are internalized by {{cells and}} agglomerate within intracellular vesicles, their optical spectra can shift and broaden {{as a result}} of plasmonic coupling of NPs in close proximity to one another. For such optical changes to be accounted for in the design of plasmonic NPs for light-based biomedical applications, quantitative design relationships between designable factors and <b>spectral</b> <b>shifts</b> need to be established. Here we begin building such a framework by investigating how functionalization of gold NPs (AuNPs) with biocompatible poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG), and the serum conditions in which the NPs are introduced to cells impact the optical changes exhibited by NPs in a cellular context. Utilizing darkfield hyperspectral imaging, we find that PEGylation decreases the <b>spectral</b> <b>shifting</b> and <b>spectral</b> broadening experienced by 100  nm AuNPs following uptake by Sk-Br- 3 cells, but up to a 33 [*]±[*] 12  nm <b>shift</b> in the <b>spectral</b> peak wavelength can still occur. The serum protein-containing biological medium also modulates the spectral changes experienced by cell-exposed NPs through the formation of a protein corona on the surface of NPs that mediates NP interactions with cells: PEGylated AuNPs exposed to cells in serum-free conditions experience greater <b>spectral</b> <b>shifts</b> than in serum-containing environments. Moreover, increased concentrations of serum (10, 25, or 50  %) result in the formation of smaller intracellular NP clusters and correspondingly reduced <b>spectral</b> <b>shifts</b> after 5 and 10  h NP-cell exposure. However, after 24  h, NP cluster size and <b>spectral</b> <b>shifts</b> are comparable and become independent of serum concentration. By elucidating the impact of PEGylation and serum concentration on the spectral changes experienced by plasmonic NPs in cells, this study provides a foundation for the optical engineering of plasmonic NPs for use in biomedical environments.|$|R

30|$|Recent advancements in darkfield {{imaging and}} {{processing}} have enabled spectra of plasmonic nanoparticles in cells {{to be captured}} more efficiently [14 – 17], therefore {{making it possible to}} quantify the extent of these <b>spectral</b> <b>shifts.</b> We recently developed a darkfield hyperspectral (HS) imaging and analysis approach to systematically quantify the magnitude of these <b>spectral</b> <b>shifts,</b> the associated <b>spectral</b> broadening, and the variability of the <b>spectral</b> <b>shifts</b> among cells in a cell population using 100 -nm bare gold NPs (AuNPs) as a model NP [13]. These results provided quantitative metrics for the first time for assessing the significance of the <b>spectral</b> <b>shifts</b> that occur in a cellular environment. In order for NPs to be more precisely designed to account for such cell-associated spectral changes in biomedical applications (preventing unintended optical effects and achieving more precise, predicted optical response), {{there is a need for}} further understanding of how NP design parameters or environmental factors can influence the spectral changes that are realized in a cellular environment. For example, it is unknown how NP size, surface chemistry, or cell type will impact the magnitude of spectral change or broadening of the NP spectra in a cellular environment. To build a framework for understanding how much designable parameters will influence the resulting spectral changes—which can aid in accounting for the changes differently based on the parameters used in an application or to aid in choosing the proper parameters during NP design to elicit or avoid the spectral shift—here we study the effect of (1) coating NPs with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and (2) serum concentration in the cellular environment.|$|R

This molecule (dye) intercalates among the lipophilic part of biological membranes. This orientation assures that the excitation inducedcharge redistribution will occur parallel to the electric field within the membrane.

Optical fibres are made from doped quartz glass. Quartz glass is a form of silicon dioxide (SiO2) with amorphous solid structure. Thermal effects induce lattice oscillations within the solid. When light falls onto these thermally excited molecular oscillations, an interaction occurs between the light particles (photons) and the electrons of the molecule. Light scattering, also known as Raman scattering, occurs in the optical fibre.

50|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism for}} metachromasia requires {{the presence of}} polyanions within the tissue. When these tissues are stained with a concentrated basic dye solution, such as toluidine blue, the bound dye molecules are close enough to form dimeric and polymeric aggregates. The light absorption spectra of these stacked dye aggregates {{differ from those of}} the individual monomeric dye molecules. Cell and tissue structures that have high concentrations of ionized sulfate and phosphate groups—such as the ground substance of cartilage, heparin-containing granules of mast cells, and rough endoplasmic reticulum of plasma cells—exhibit metachromasia. This depends on the charge density of the negative sulfate and carboxylate anions in the glycosaminoglycan (GAG). The GAG polyanion stabilizes the stacked, positively-charged dye molecules, resulting in a <b>spectral</b> <b>shift</b> as the conjugated double bond π-orbitals of adjacent dye molecules overlap. The greater the degree of stacking, the greater the metachromatic shift. Thus, hyaluronic acid, lacking sulphate groups and with only moderate charge density, causes slight metachromasia; chondroitin sulfate, with an additional sulfate residue per GAG saccharide dimer, is an effective metachromatic substrate, whilst heparin, with further N-sulfation, is strongly metachromatic. Therefore, toluidine blue will appear purple to red when it stains these components.|$|E
50|$|Cavity {{perturbation}} theory generally relies on formulae involving stored energy considerations. The following sections of this wikipedia pages {{are based on}} these formulae. The latter appear intuitive since the common sense dictates that the maximum change in resonant frequency is achieved when the small perturbation is placed at the intensity maximum of the cavity mode. This intuition is valid for high-Q cavities only and when predicting the <b>spectral</b> <b>shift</b> of the resonance frequency. However, the shift is always accompanied by a broadening of the resonance width, i.e. a decrease of Q, {{and it is important}} to predict it also. The classical formulae based on energy considerations, i.e. on |E.E| products, cannot predict the broadening. For low-Q cavities, such as plasmonic resonators, they cannot predict neither the shift, nor the broadening. Correct formulae that are accurate for high- and low-Q resonators and for the shift and the brodening, have been established in 2015, see Nano Lett. 15 (5), pp 3439-3444 (2015). They are as simple, but use E.E products instead of |E.E| products. Importantly, the phase of the resonant mode is preserved in the new formulae.|$|E
50|$|In aqueous {{solution}} {{large numbers of}} Alcian blue molecules stack together as micelles of very large size, too large to be even dialysed. Thus even at a fairly high dilution, it has an absorption maximum at ~600-615 nm, which is actually not the absorption maximum of a dye monomer but that of the multimer. Since the absorbed light is of yellow orange spectrum, the transmitted/reflected light is perceived by our eye as the complementary color of slightly greenish blue or cyan. In {{aqueous solution}} Alcian blues continue to be metachromatic at molar concentrations one hundredth those at which toluidine blue is mainly orthochromatic. Only a very small shoulder of the absorption curve at 670-680 nm represent the monomeric dye, which is usually the minority and becomes even lesser minority (<108M) in presence of salts. However, when the solvent is DMSO—a non-protic solvent of moderately high dielectric constant, Alcian blue does not aggregate and a big monomeric absorption peak can be well visualized. A similar <b>spectral</b> <b>shift</b> to the longer monomeric peak is also observed when solvents like ethanol (or ethanol water mixture) {{is used as a}} vehicle or when nonionic detergents like Triton X-100 are used, that make exogenous micelles.|$|E
