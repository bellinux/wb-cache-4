25|$|Wine is {{important}} in cuisine not just for its value as a beverage, but as a flavor agent, primarily in stocks and braising, since its acidity lends balance to rich savory or sweet dishes. Wine sauce {{is an example of}} a culinary <b>sauce</b> <b>that</b> uses wine as a primary ingredient. Natural wines may exhibit a broad range of alcohol content, from below 9% to above 16% ABV, with most wines being in the 12.5–14.5% range. Fortified wines (usually with brandy) may contain 20% alcohol or more.|$|E
500|$|Among leading musical figures at {{the premiere}} were Jules Massenet, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Charles Gounod. Geneviève, {{suffering}} from an abscess {{in her right}} eye, was unable to be present. The opera's first performance extended to four-and-a-half hours; the final act did not begin until after midnight. Afterwards, Massenet and Saint-Saëns were congratulatory, Gounod less so. According to one account, he accused Bizet of plagiarism: [...] "Georges has robbed me! Take the Spanish airs and mine out of the score and there remains nothing to Bizet's credit but the <b>sauce</b> <b>that</b> masks the fish". Much of the press comment was negative, expressing consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue. Galli-Marié's performance was described by one critic as [...] "the very incarnation of vice". Others complained {{of a lack of}} melody and made unfavourable comparisons with the traditional Opéra-Comique fare of Auber and Boieldieu. Léon Escudier in L'Art Musical called the music [...] "dull and obscure... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes". There was, however, praise from the poet Théodore de Banville, who applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Opéra-Comique [...] "puppets". The public's reaction was lukewarm, and Bizet soon became convinced of its failure: [...] "I foresee a definite and hopeless flop".|$|E

2500|$|In Indonesian cuisine, {{which is}} similar to Malay, the term kecap refers to {{fermented}} savory sauces. Two main types are well known in their cuisine: kecap asin which translates to 'salty kecap' in Indonesian (a salty soy sauce) and kecap manis or literally [...] "sweet kecap" [...] in Indonesian.

2500|$|In March 2012, Greg Smith, then-head of Goldman Sachs US equity {{derivatives}} sales {{business in}} Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), resigned his position via a critical letter printed as an op-ed in The New York Times. In the letter, he attacked Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Lloyd Blankfein for losing {{touch with the}} company's culture, which he described as [...] "the secret <b>sauce</b> <b>that</b> made this place great and allowed us to earn our clients' trust for 143 years." [...] Smith said that advising clients [...] "to do what I believe is right for them" [...] was becoming increasingly unpopular. Instead there was a [...] "toxic and destructive" [...] environment in which [...] "the interests of the client continue to be sidelined", senior management described clients as [...] "" [...] and colleagues callously talked about [...] "ripping their clients off". In reply, Goldman Sachs said that [...] "we will only be successful if our clients are successful", claiming [...] "this fundamental truth {{lies at the heart}} of how we conduct ourselves" [...] and that [...] "we don't think [...] reflect the way we run our business." [...] Later that year, Smith published a book titled Why I left Goldman Sachs.|$|E

60|$|To-day {{there were}} more changes on the bill of fare than usual. The soups were lighter; pork was {{eliminated}} from the entrées, figuring only with Russian turnips among the roasts. The gracious spirit of spring pervaded the entire menu. Lamb, that lately capered on the greening hillsides, was becoming exploited with the <b>sauce</b> <b>that</b> commemorated its gambols. The song of the oyster, though not silenced, was dimuendo con amore. The frying-pan seemed to be held, inactive, behind the beneficent bars of the broiler.

60|$|So we {{went out}} into the garden where the tall, impassive ladies were {{arranging}} many wooden dishes on the ground. Now the moon was clear of clouds, and by its brilliant light we examined their contents. Some were cooked meat covered with a kind of <b>sauce</b> <b>that</b> made its nature indistinguishable. As a matter of fact, I believe it was mutton, but--who could say? Others were evidently of a vegetable nature. For instance, there was a whole platter full of roasted mealie cobs and a great boiled pumpkin, to say nothing of some bowls of curdled milk. Regarding this feast I became aware of a sudden and complete conversion to those principles of vegetarianism which Brother John was always preaching to me.|$|E

If you took some very thin hock, and tried to mull it and forgot all about the brew till it was half cold, you would get saki.
