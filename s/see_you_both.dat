For other crimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race {{a long time}} on my register, doomed to {{destruction}} and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay a moment, Mr. Gray," [...] {{said the}} lawyer. [...] "You {{are going to}} town, and will not think it a trouble to see Mrs. Smith safely back to her hotel.

6000|$|... "But," [...] {{continued}} Jonas, [...] "you, Rollo, {{were playing}} here alone. Your little cousin came to <b>see</b> you; and <b>you</b> were {{very glad to}} have him come.

"She's {{too good}} for you evidently; she is like you, but {{something}} better than you--no beauty, though; yet when she rose (for I looked back to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> walk away) I thought her figure and carriage good.

6000|$|... "You ain't yourself, Sam Telfair. You ain't {{what you}} was once. I don't {{know about these}} cities and flats over here.
