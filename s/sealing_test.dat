The latter was intended to increase the life-time of the solar cells.

40|$|George Stephenson Gold Medal, atorgada per la Institution of Civil Engineering (U. K.) The paper {{describes}} a theoretical and {{experimental study of}} the coupled hydromechanical behaviour of a compacted mixture of bentonite powder and bentonite pellets intended as sealing material in underground repositories for nuclear waste. One of the main advantages {{of the use of}} powder/pellets mixtures is the reduction of the compaction effort required to achieve the value of average dry density necessary to attain the required swelling potential. However, the heterogeneous fabric of the material requires special approaches in order to describe adequately its behaviour during hydration. A double porosity formulation is presented to account for the presence of two distinct structural levels in the material. Hydraulic equilibrium between the two porosities is not assumed; instead a water exchange term between them is postulated. The formulation is applied to the modelling of a number of one-dimensional swelling pressure tests performed in the CEA (Commisariat à l’Énergie Atomique,France) and CIEMAT (Spain) laboratories. A very satisfactory quantitative description of the experimental observations is obtained that includes a number of complex behaviour features such as size effects and nonmonotonic development of swelling pressures. Some microfabric observations using X-ray tomography and mercury intrusion porosimetry lend support to the conceptual approach adopted. The formulation is then applied to the analysis of a long-term large-scale <b>sealing</b> <b>test</b> performed at the Hades underground facility in Belgium, using the same set of hydraulic and mechanical parameters employed in the modelling of the laboratory tests. Although the field observations exhibit a much higher degree of scatter, the basic behaviour of the field <b>sealing</b> <b>test</b> is satisfactorily simulated. A formulation that incorporates basic features of the microfabric of the mixture is thus able to span successfully over a large range of space and time scales.

30|$|The proper {{assembly}} of underground precast concrete structures is often {{critical in the}} construction of underground structures. In particular, interfacial waterproofing between precast concrete segments is a key factor influencing use, safety, and life span. Current practice is to incorporate waterproofing rubber strips in the design. During the installation process, compressive stress is applied to the strip by post-tensioning to achieve performance. For this paper, lateral constraint compression tests were carried out on composite rubber seal strips that utilize putty. Special waterproofing and <b>sealing</b> <b>test</b> devices were designed to investigate corresponding relationships between water pressure and compressive stress (or strain). A relationship between water resistance pressure and compression stress and strain of the putty-based composite rubber strip was proposed based on the series tests and the control target of the minimum compression strain of the putty composite rubber strip was then suggested. Finally, full-scale waterproofing tests on tunnel joints were conducted. The experimental results provide a scientific reference for the engineering application and design of composite sealing rubber strips putty for underground post-tensioned precast concrete structures.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} two {{case studies}} that {{provide information on}} the process of homogenization of initially heterogeneous clay barriers and seals. The first case is the canister retrieval test performed in the Aspö Hard Rock Laboratory (Sweden). The heterogeneity arises from the use of a combination of blocks and pellets to construct the engineered barrier. The degree of homogenization achieved {{by the end of the}} tests is evaluated from data obtained during the dismantling of the test. To assist in the interpretation of the test, a fully coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) analysis has been carried out.

40|$|The {{target of}} the study is to explore the {{opportunity}} of enhancing the adhesion of polyethylene terephthalate to the cardboard when the coating thickness of polyethylene terephthalate onto the cardboard is diminished. The reference coating weight is 40 g/m 2 and the target is to achieve same great adhesion with between 25 - 30 g/m 2 coating weight. According to the purpose of the thesis, literature study includes principles of extrusion coating, differences in extrusion coating of polyesters and polyolefins, adhesion theories and practical methods for adhesion improvement in extrusion coating. Literature study is followed by an experimental part, where adhesion improvement by changing processing parameters, modifying process equipments and trying different grades of polyethylene terephthalate was studied once the coating weight is diminished. In the experimental part of the study, 5 adhesion trials are performed. In adhesion trial 1 and 2, PET 1 grade is utilized and PET 2 grade is utilized in adhesion trial 3, 4, 5. Firstly, both grades of PET are screened by performing with only corona as a pretreatment method by following same processing parameters. In screening trials, process variable is air gap. In the following adhesion trials, the effect of flame treatment by performing with various air gap levels and the effect of process equipment modifications by performing with various line speeds are studied for both of them by following same processing parameters. After trials have done, samples are analyzed. Analysis methods can be examined in two different groups: main and additional analysis methods. Main analysis methods are adhesion test by hand, grammage test and neck-in test. Additional analysis methods are heat <b>sealing</b> <b>test,</b> microscopy test and pinhole test. For the application of addditional test methods, it is decided that they will be performed if the adhesion level of polyethylene terephthalate on the cardboard reaches the level of 5 over 5 at the target coating weight. The best attained adhesion of PET 1 is the level of 4 over 5 by performing only with corona during the screening trial. Normally, the best adhesion results is expected from modifications of process equipments results. The most probable reason of the situation is high melt temperature that caused thermal degradation. In the case of adhesion of PET 2 grade, the best adhesion level is 4 over of 5 while performing with modified process equipments. In addition, coating weight results of PET 2 obtained from common test points are generally out of the target coating weight range. This shows {{that it is possible to}} reach almost same adhesion level at lower coating weight levels by utilizing PET 2 grade. All in all, it is proven that it is possible to run the process at 30 g/m 2 coating with almost perfect adhesion for both polyethylene terephthalate grades. Better adhesion can be achieved by performing with high line speeds, high screw speeds and minimum air gap values...|$|E

40|$|Brush seals {{have been}} {{incorporated}} in the latest turbine engines to reduce leakage and improve efficiency. However, the life of these seals is limited by wear. Studies have shown that optimal sealing characteristics for a brush seal occur before the interference fit between the brush and shaft is excessively worn. Research to develop improved tribopairs (brush and coating) with reduced wear and lower friction has been hindered {{by the lack of}} an accurate, low-cost, efficient test methodology. Estimated costs for evaluating a new material combination in an engine company <b>seal</b> <b>test</b> program are on the order of $ 100, 000. To address this need, the NASA Lewis Research Center designed, built, and validated a unique, innovative brush seal tuft tester that slides a single tuft of brush seal wire against a rotating shaft under controlled loads, speeds, and temperatures comparable to those in turbine engines. As an initial screening tool, the brush seal tuft tester can tribologicaly evaluate candidate seal materials for 1 / 10 th the cost of full-scale <b>seal</b> <b>tests.</b> Previous {{to the development of the}} brush seal tuft tester facility, most relevant tribological data had been obtained from full-scale <b>seal</b> <b>tests</b> conducted primarily to determine seal leakage characteristics. However, from a tribological point of view, these tests included the confounding effects of varying contact pressures, bristle flaring, high-temperature oxidation, and varying bristle contact angles. These confounding effects are overcome in tuft testing. The interface contact pressures can be either constant or varying depending on the tuft mounting device, and bristle wear can be measured optically with inscribed witness marks. In a recent cooperative program with a U. S. turbine engine manufacturer, five metallic wire candidates were tested against a plasma-sprayed Nichrome-bonded chrome carbide. The wire materials used during this collaboration were either nickel-chrome- or cobaltchrome-based superalloys. These <b>tests</b> corroborated full-scale <b>seal</b> <b>test</b> results and provided insight into previously untested combinations. As the cycle temperature for improved efficiency turbine engines increases, new brush seal materials combinations must be considered. Future brush <b>seal</b> tuft <b>testing</b> will include both metallic and ceramic bristles versus commercial and NASA-developed shaft coatings.

So, in this paper the appropriate condition to apply lubricant is clarified by a series of bolt tightening <b>tests</b> and <b>sealing</b> <b>tests</b> results. On the other hand, for the bolted flanges applying spiral wound gaskets, measuring the gasket compress dimensions help us to prevent uneven tightening balance and to perform the appropriate tightening work. Appropriate gasket compress dimensions are also clarified to ensure the sealing performance for the flanges based on the <b>sealing</b> <b>tests</b> results. Based on these test results, recommended flange-tightening methods have been summarized as an instruction and tightening work procedure to improve the sealing performance of the bolted flanges and the workability of flange tightening work...|$|R
