Grape berries are abundant in <b>stilbenes</b> with resveratrol present {{not only in}} the fruits but in leaves, stems, roots and canes too. They have been widely investigated owing to their antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, cardio protective, neuroprotective, anti-aging, and anticancer properties. About 13 Grapevine <b>stilbenes</b> were quantified with ε-viniferin and resveratrol being more abundant of all [78].

In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory capacities of <b>stilbenes</b> against alpha-synuclein aggregation and toxicity. Thioflavin T fluorescence, transmission electronic microscopy, and SDS-PAGE analysis were performed to investigate the inhibitory effects of three <b>stilbenes</b> against alpha-synuclein aggregation: piceatannol, ampelopsin A, and isohopeaphenol. Lipid vesicle permeabilization assays were performed to screen <b>stilbenes</b> for protection against membrane damage induced by aggregated alpha-synuclein. The viability of PC 12 cells was examined using an MTT assay to assess the preventive effects of <b>stilbenes</b> against alpha-synuclein-induced toxicity.

40|$|Grape canes are a {{waste product}} from {{viticulture}} that show potential as an industrially extractable source of <b>stilbenes,</b> which are valuable for medical and other purposes. In this work, grape canes collected in three consecutive years (2014 – 2016) at six different places in South Moravia, Czech Republic were extracted, and {{the contents of}} trans-resveratrol, trans-ε-viniferin, and r 2 -viniferin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The study included three blue grape varieties of Vitis vinifera L. (Cabernet Moravia, Blaufränkisch, and Piwi variety Laurot) and four white grape varieties (Chardonnay, Green Veltliner, Piwi variety Hibernal, and Piwi variety Malverina). From the viewpoint of producing extracts with high <b>stilbenes</b> content, the Hibernal variety is clearly the best. The mean amounts of the <b>stilbenes</b> for this variety at all localities and for all three years were 4. 99 g/kg for trans-resveratrol, 3. 24 g/kg for trans-ε-viniferin, and 1. 73 g/kg for r 2 -viniferin. The influence of vintage, locality, and variety on the amounts of <b>stilbenes</b> was studied using PCA analysis. In contrast to expectations, there was no strong impact of locality on <b>stilbenes</b> content. The differences were varietal for most varieties, regardless of the area of cultivation.

Following increasing infection rates, different <b>stilbenes</b> were produced and accumulated in leaves and berries of the same clone.

25|$|DuP-697 was a building-block for {{synthesis}} of COX-2 inhibitors {{and served as}} the basic chemical model for the coxibs that are the only selective COX-2 inhibitors on the market today. DuP-697 is a diaryl heterocycle with cis-stilbene moiety. Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies for diaryl heterocyclic compounds have indicated that a cis-stilbene moiety {{and changes in the}} para-position of one of the aryl rings {{play an important role in}} COX-2 selectivity. Celecoxib and parecoxib have a sulfonamide substituent (SO2NH2) in para-position on one of the aryl rings while etoricoxib and rofecoxib have a methylsulfone (SO2CH3). The oxidation state on the sulfur is important for selectivity; sulfones and sulfonamides are selective for COX-2 but sulfoxides and sulfides are not. The ring system that is fused in this <b>stilbene</b> system has been extensively manipulated to include every imaginable heterocyclic and carbocyclic skeleton of varying ring sizes. It is known that a SO2NHCOCH3 moiety as in parecoxib, which is a prodrug for valdecoxib, is 105– 106 more reactive acetylating agent of enzyme serine hydroxyl groups than simple amides. Due to the fact that varying kinetic mechanisms affect potency for COX-1 versus COX-2, relying Potency and selectivity in human whole blood is used by many groups and has been accepted as a standard assessment of COX-2 potency and selectivity.|$|E

40|$|<b>Stilbenes,</b> {{especially}} resveratrol and its derivatives, {{have become}} {{famous for their}} positive effects {{on a wide range}} of medical disorders, as indicated by a huge number of published studies. A less investigated area of research is their antimicrobial properties. A series of 13 trans-resveratrol analogues was synthesized via Wittig or Heck reactions, and their antimicrobial activity assessed on two different grapevine pathogens responsible for severe diseases in the vineyard. The entire series, together with resveratrol, was first evaluated on the zoospore mobility and sporulation level of Plasmopara viticola (the oomycete responsible for downy mildew). <b>Stilbenes</b> displayed a spectrum of activity ranging from low to high. Six of them, including the most active ones, were subsequently tested on the development of Botrytis cinerea (fungus responsible for grey mold).

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} and conditions affecting expression of systemic induced resistance (SIR) in pine are not clearly understood. Two hypotheses were tested here: that SIR against a pathogen induced by either a pathogen or an insect involves coordinated shifts in phloem secondary metabolism; and that fertility affects {{the production of}} these compounds. • To test these hypotheses, a tripartite system was used comprising Austrian pine (Pinus nigra) grown under three different fertility regimes, the fungal pathogen Diplodia pinea, and the defoliator Neodiprion sertifer. • Fungal induction led to systemic accumulation of lignin, phenolic glycosides and <b>stilbenes,</b> whereas insect defoliation led {{to an increase in}} germacrene D concentration in branch phloem. Fertility affected the concentrations of only the phenolic glycosides. Multivariate analyses showed coregulation of compounds within at least three consistent groupings: phenolic glycosides, <b>stilbenes</b> and monoterpenes.
