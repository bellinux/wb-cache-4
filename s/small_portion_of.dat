5|$|When NY373 was {{assigned}} in 1930, a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> it was {{maintained by the}} town of Chesterfield. This section {{was turned over to}} the State of New York during a maintenance swap with Essex County in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Box {{huckleberry}} prefers dry, acidic soils, including duff, {{and partial}} shade. Locations on wooded slopes tend to face north; however, the New Bloomfield site faces west. At {{one of the}} Delaware sites, a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the colony extended to the wet margin of a marsh, but most was located on dry, sandy soil upslope.|$|E

5|$|Quaggas {{have been}} {{reported}} gathering into herds of 30–50 individuals and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion. They may have been sympatric with Burchell's zebra between the Vaal and Orange rivers. This is disputed, {{and there is no}} evidence that they interbred. It could also have shared a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> its range with Hartmann's mountain zebra (Equus zebra hartmannae).|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes vary in {{intensity}} regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes {{tend to be}} stronger. In the case of violent tornadoes, only a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from subvortices.|$|E
5|$|After it {{captured}} Kupres, the OG-11 turned south, in {{the direction}} of Gornji Malovan, Donji Malovan and Šuica. The attack, spearheaded by the 9th Armoured Battalion, reached Gornji Malovan on 10 April, the day Robert Zadro was killed. Fighting continued around Kupres until 11 April. Most of the Bosnian Croat TO troops, formally reorganised as the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO) on 8 April, withdrew from the Kupres Plateau towards Šuica, while a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the troops was forced to retreat via the Mount Cincar towards Livno.|$|E
5|$|Early {{suggestions}} were to show cutaways {{of just a}} <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the audience, but {{the full}} effect was achieved by only showing {{the back of the}} audience. To save time, most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, Ratatouille. Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is Skinner's lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.|$|E

5|$|Gandalf reappears to warn all of an {{approaching}} army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do they win the climactic Battle of Five Armies.

Bilbo accepts only a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> {{his share of the}} treasure, having no want or need for more, but still returns home a very wealthy hobbit.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 Colalucci {{undertook}} {{a series of}} experiments to discover the right approach {{for the restoration of}} the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. The investigation began by testing small areas of the wall fresco, Conflict over the Body of Moses by Matteo de Lecce, which had similar physical and chemical attributes to the painting techniques employed on Michelangelo's frescoes. Trials to find the right solvents were continued on a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the Eleazar and Matthan lunette.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 renumbering, NY28 was {{extended}} south from Colliersville to Kingston largely {{by way of}} its current alignment along the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike. North of Cooperstown, the route was realigned to follow its modern routing between Cooperstown and Mohawk, then extended into the North Country through Wevertown to Warrensburg along its present alignment. Between Colliersville and Cooperstown, the route remained unchanged. The <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> NY10A that did not become part of NY28 in the renumbering was incorporated into NY10.|$|E

5|$|Jersey Royal {{potatoes}} are the local {{variety of new}} potato, and the island {{is famous for its}} early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing côtils (steeply sloping fields). Originally grown using vraic as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, only a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> those grown in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.|$|E
5|$|Lawton Public Schools serves most of {{the city}} of Lawton. The {{district}} operates two prekindergarten centers, 24 elementary schools, four middle schools, and three high schools – Eisenhower, Lawton, and MacArthur. In 2008, Lawton Public Schools had an enrollment of about 16,000 students with about 1,000 teachers. Two independent districts, Bishop and Flower Mound, serve portions of Lawton. Bishop operates a single PK–6 elementary campus and Flower Mound has a PK–8 campus. Secondary students living in these districts attend Lawton Public Schools. A <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> far-west Lawton is served by Cache Public Schools.|$|E
5|$|NY45 runs {{parallel}} to the <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the Garden State Parkway (GSP) that enters New York. Officially this portion is considered {{an extension of the}} New York State Thruway. While NY45 never intersects the GSP, it provides a link to the parkway. South of the New Jersey border in Bergen County, CR73 intersects the GSP, and in New York, NY45 intersects CR41, which intersects the parkway. Through Chestnut Ridge (where it is known as Chestnut Ridge Road, just as CR73, its southern extension, is in New Jersey), it crosses the New York State Thruway.|$|E

5|$|Peierls {{knew the}} {{importance}} {{of the size of the}} critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{contribution}} to the Battle of Normandy involved more than 3,000 military personnel serving under British command. The majority of these personnel {{were members of the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), though smaller numbers of Australians serving with the Royal Navy and British Army also participated in the fighting prior to and after the Allied landings on 6 June 1944. While all the RAAF units based in the United Kingdom (UK) took part in the battle, Australians made up only a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the Allied force.|$|E
5|$|The Court's {{caseload}} {{continued to}} grow over time. In 1881 the general assembly approved {{the creation of a}} five-member panel of commissioners to assist the justices in administrative tasks. Even this was not enough to handle the load. In 1891 the Appellate Court of Indiana was created to handle cases of lower importance. At first the appellate court only took a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the Supreme Court's caseload, but its responsibility gradually increased.|$|E
