After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are <b>sorbed</b> onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.|$|E

25|$|The {{chemical}} potential is explained here {{since it is}} the true driving force for the transport of water in both liquid and vapour phases in wood (Siau, 1984). The Gibbs free energy per mole of substance is usually expressed as the {{chemical potential}} (Skaar, 1933). The chemical potential of unsaturated air or wood below the fibre saturation point influences the drying of wood. Equilibrium will occur at the equilibrium moisture content (as defined earlier) of wood when the chemical potential of the wood becomes equal to that of the surrounding air. The chemical potential of <b>sorbed</b> water is a function of wood moisture content. Therefore, a gradient of wood moisture content (between surface and centre), or more specifically of activity, is accompanied by a gradient of chemical potential under isothermal conditions. Moisture will redistribute itself throughout the wood until the chemical potential is uniform throughout, resulting in a zero potential gradient at equilibrium (Skaar, 1988). The flux of moisture attempting to achieve the equilibrium state is assumed to be proportional to the difference in chemical potential, and inversely proportional to the path length over which the potential difference acts (Keey et al., 2000).|$|E

60|$|The {{second time}} I went to Blois I took a {{carriage}} for Chambord, {{and came back}} by the Chateau de Cheverny and the forest of Russy, - a charming little expedition, to which {{the beauty of the}} afternoon (the finest in a rainy season that was spotted with bright days) contributed not a little. To go to Chambord, you cross the Loire, leave it on one side, and strike away through a country in which salient features be- come less and less numerous, and which at last has no other quality than a look of intense, and peculiar rurality, - the characteristic, even when it is not the charm, of so much of the landscape of France. This is not the appearance of wildness, for it goes with great cultivation; it is simply the presence of the delving, drudging, economizing peasant. But it is a deep, unrelieved rusticity. It is a peasant's landscape; not, as in England, a landlord's. On the way to Cham- bord you enter the flat and sandy Sologne. The wide horizon opens out like a great potager, without inter- ruptions, without an eminence, with here and there a long, low stretch of wood. There is an absence of hedges, fences, signs of property; everything is ab- <b>sorbed</b> in the general flatness, - the patches of vine- yard, the scattered cottages, the villages, the children (planted and staring and almost always pretty), the women in the fields, the white caps, the faded blouses, the big sabots. At the end of an hour's drive (they assure you at Blois that even with two horses you will spend double that time), I passed through a sort of gap in a wall, which does duty as the gateway of the domain of an exiled pretender. I drove along a straight avenue, through a disfeatured park, - the park of Chambord has twenty-one miles of circumference, - a very sandy, scrubby, melancholy plantation, in which the timber must have been cut many times over and is to-day a mere tangle of brushwood. Here, as in so many spots in France, the traveller perceives that he is in a land of revolutoins. Nevertheless, its great ex- tent and the long perspective of its avenues give this desolate boskage a certain majesty; just as its shabbi- ness places it in agreement with one of the strongest impressions of the chateau. You follow one of these long perspectives a proportionate time, and at last you see the chimneys and pinnacles of Chambord rise ap- parently out of the ground. The filling-in of the wide moats that formerly surrounded it has, in vulgar par- lance, let it down, bud given it an appearance of top- heaviness that {{is at the same time}} a magnificent Orien- talism. The towers, the turrets, the cupolas, the gables, the lanterns, the chimneys, look more like the spires of a city than the salient points of a single building. You emerge from the avenue and find yourself at the foot of an enormous fantastic mass. Chambord has a strange mixture of society and solitude. A little village clusters within view of its stately windows, and a couple of inns near by offer entertainment to pilgrims. These things, of course, are incidents of the political pro- scription which hangs its thick veil over the place. Chambord is truly royal, - royal in its great scale, its grand air, its indifference to common considerations. If a cat may look at a king, a palace may lock at a tavern. I enjoyed my visit to this extraordinary struc- ture as much as if I had been a legitimist; and indeed there is something interesting in any monument of a great system, any bold presentation of a tradition.|$|E

40|$|Vascular {{system in}} all {{vertebrate}} organisms has in charge essential {{functions such as}} to bring nutrients, oxygen and signalling molecules to distant organs. Vascular network is established through sequential and distinct processes. During embryogenesis, angioblasts give rise to differentiated endothelial cells, which form primary vessels through vasculogenesis. Expansion of this primary network is then achieved through a multistep process known as angiogenesis. During angiogenesis, remodelling of endothelial cell shape relies on cytoskeleton dynamics. In this study, {{our goal was to}} investigate the potential role of the SoHo family of adaptor proteins in angiogenesis. The SoHo family comprises three members, <b>Sorbs</b> 1, <b>Sorbs</b> 2 and <b>Sorbs</b> 3. Although accumulative evidence links this protein family to the regulation of cell adhesion and actin cytoskeletal organisation, their expression and potential functions in endothelial cells remain unknown. Using zebrafish loss of function experiments combined with confocal imaging, we show that loss of <b>Sorbs</b> 1 affects caudal vein-derived vessel formation, whereas <b>Sorbs</b> 2 depletion impairs ISV development essentially derived from the dorsal aorta. We then demonstrated that both members impact on EC behaviour via regulation of RhoGTPases activity, leading to the vascular defects observed in vivo. Using a series of in vitro functional assays, we found that <b>Sorbs</b> 1 and <b>Sorbs</b> 2 have opposite effects on adhesives properties of HUVECs related to their ability to regulate different RhoGTPases. <b>Sorbs</b> 1 depleted ECs adhere excessively to the ECM due to decrease in Rac 1 activity. In contrast, loss of <b>Sorbs</b> 2 impaired RhoA activation during adhesion and decreases cell adhesiveness to the matrix. Interestingly, these opposite effects on cell adhesion lead to similar outcome on EC migratory abilities, a decrease in cell migration. Here, for the first time, we establish a role for <b>Sorbs</b> 1 and <b>Sorbs</b> 2 in angiogenesis and demonstrate that these SoHo members are essential for EC adhesiveness and subsequent migratory abilities...|$|R

50|$|Degradation and {{sorption}} {{are both}} factors which influence {{the persistence of}} pesticides in soil. Depending on the chemical nature of the pesticide, such processes control directly the transportation from soil to water, and in turn to air and our food. Breaking down organic substances, degradation, involves interactions among microorganisms in the soil. Sorption affects bioaccumulation of pesticides which are dependent on organic matter in the soil. Weak organic acids {{have been shown to}} be weakly <b>sorbed</b> by soil, because of pH and mostly acidic structure. <b>Sorbed</b> chemicals {{have been shown to be}} less accessible to microorganisms. Aging mechanisms are poorly understood but as residence times in soil increase, pesticide residues become more resistant to degradation and extraction as they lose biological activity.|$|E

The goal of this project is to identify the developmental function of <b>Sorbs</b> 1 and characterize the underlying molecular events by exploiting a combination of in vivo (Zebrafish) and in vitro models. Phenotype analysis revealed that Morpholino-mediated knock-down of <b>Sorbs</b> 1 induces abnormal development of cardiac, angiogenic and muscles structures. Knock-down zebrafish embryos were unable to form cardiac looping and present a cardiac edema. Also, it was noticed that tail morphology was altered by <b>Sorbs</b> 1 knock-down suggesting that <b>Sorbs</b> 1 plays a role in trunk muscle formation.
