50|$|A Schottky defect is an {{intrinsic}} point defect that creates vacancies {{on both the}} cation and anion sublattices. This defect occurs in ionic crystals when one (positively charged) cation and one (negatively charged) anion leave the lattice simultaneously, resulting in two vacant lattice sites. Because the mass, site, and charge must remain balanced, these vacancies always occur in <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratios.</b> However, due {{to the loss of}} ions within the crystal lattice, these Schottky defects tend to lead to a decrease in the density of the material because vacancies have been created.|$|E

5000|$|Fuel economy: An {{air-fuel mixture}} leaner than the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratio</b> {{will result in}} near-optimal fuel mileage, costing less per {{distance}} traveled and producing {{the least amount of}} CO2 emissions. However, from the factory, cars are designed to operate at the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratio</b> (rather than as lean as possible while remaining drivable) to maximize the efficiency and life of the catalytic converter. While {{it may be possible to}} run smoothly at mixtures leaner than the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratio,</b> manufacturers must focus on emissions and especially catalytic converter life (which must now be 100,000 miles (160,000 km) on new vehicles [...] ) as a higher priority due to U.S. EPA regulations.|$|R

The mixture is {{adjusted}} {{by one or more}} needle valves on an automotive carburetor, or a pilot-operated lever on piston-engined aircraft (since the mixture changes with air density and therefore altitude). Independent of air density the (stoichiometric) air to gasoline ratio is 14.7:1, meaning that for each mass unit of gasoline, 14.7 mass units of air are required.

Among many proposals, a model has been introduced {{that takes into account}} epigenetic inheritance on the risk and recurrence risk of a complex disease. The limiting pathway (LP) model has been introduced in which a trait depends on the value of k inputs that can have rate limitations due to <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratios,</b> reactants required in a biochemical pathway, or proteins required for transcription of a gene. Each of these k inputs is a strictly additive trait that depends on a set of common or rare variants. When k = 1, the LP model is simply a standard additive trait.|$|E
50|$|Redfield ratio or Redfield {{stoichiometry}} is {{the atomic}} ratio of carbon, {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} found in phytoplankton and throughout the deep oceans. This empirically developed stoichiometric ratio was originally found to be C:N:P = 106:16:1 (and has more recently been revised to 117:14:1). This term is named after the American oceanographer Alfred C. Redfield, who first described this ratio in an article written in 1934 (Redfield 1934). As a Harvard physiologist, Redfield participated in several voyages on board the research vessel Atlantis. Alfred Redfield analyzed thousands of samples of marine biomass across all of the ocean regions. From this research he found that globally the elemental composition of marine organic matter (dead and living) was remarkably constant across all of the regions. The <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratios</b> of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus remain relatively consistent from both the coastal to open ocean regions.|$|E

Many main group compounds can also be classed as “organometallic”, as they contain organic groups, e.g., B(CH3)3). Main group compounds also occur in nature, e.g., phosphate in DNA, and therefore may be classed as bioinorganic. Conversely, organic compounds lacking (many) hydrogen ligands can be classed as “inorganic”, such as the fullerenes, buckytubes and binary carbon oxides.|$|E
50|$|Metal alkoxides, {{carboxylates}} such as alumatrane Al(OCH2CH2)3N, silatrane Si(OCH2CH2)3NOCH2CH2N(CH2CH2OH)2, and zirconium propionate Zr(O2CCH2CH3)2-(OH)2, {{are generally}} used, {{and they are}} dissolved in an alcohol solvent such as methanol or ethanol. Solubility of the precursor in alcohol is an important property, which {{is controlled by the}} ligands. Too much carbon in the ligand may promote formation of metal carbonate as a secondary minor phase since enormous amounts of CO2 are generated on combustion which may react with metal oxides. Too little carbon in the ligand will limit the solubility of precursor in alcohol. The process is inexpensive as metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates or nitrates can be used as starting points for precursor synthesis. For mixed-metal oxides, one can either synthesize a double-alkoxide which contains two metal elements such as magnesium aluminum double alkoxide as shown in Table 1, or simply mix different alkoxide and/or carboxylates in <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratios.</b> For example, LF-FSP products of alumatrane and silatrane glycolate dissolved in ethanol at 3:1 molar ratio is mullite (3Al2O3•2SiO2). Stoichiometry of nanopowder made through LF-FSP corresponds to that of its precursor.|$|E
50|$|Metals are {{insoluble}} {{in water}} or organic solvents unless they undergo a reaction with them. Typically this is an oxidation reaction that robs the metal atoms of their itinerant electrons, destroying the metallic bonding. However metals are often readily soluble in each other while retaining the metallic character of their bonding. Gold, for example, dissolves easily in mercury, even at room temperature. Even in solid metals, the solubility can be extensive. If the structures of the two metals are the same, there can even be complete solid solubility, {{as in the case}} of electrum, the alloys of silver and gold. At times, however, two metals will form alloys with different structures than either of the two parents. One could call these materials metal compounds, but, because materials with metallic bonding are typically not molecular, Dalton's law of integral proportions is not valid and often a range of <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratios</b> can be achieved. It is better to abandon such concepts as 'pure substance' or 'solute' is such cases and speak of phases instead. The study of such phases has traditionally been more the domain of metallurgy than of chemistry, although the two fields overlap considerably.|$|E

From Figure  2 a’, we can observe the successful incorporation of Cu element into the ZnS nanotubes in the compositional information, and the Cu/Zn <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratio</b> is 0.47. The signal of Si originates from the substrate. With the increase of the reaction time, the Cu/Zn <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratio</b> becomes higher and higher (from 1.21 to 2.82) {{due to the fact}} that more and more Zn atoms were replaced by Cu atoms with the reaction processing, as shown in Figure  2 b’,c’. Further chemical reaction will yield pure Cu 2 S nanotubes, which can be unambiguously confirmed by the EDX spectrum in Figure  2 d’. There are only Cu, S, and Si elements without any Zn element, and the Cu/S <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratio</b> is 2.0.

40|$|The <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratios</b> of {{dissolved}} {{inorganic carbon}} (DIC) and nutrients during biological removal have been widely assumed to follow the Redfield ratios (especially the C/N ratio) in large river plume ecosystems. However, this assumption has not been systematically examined and documented because DIC and nutrients are rarely studied simultaneously in a river plume area, a region {{in which they can}} be affected by strong river-ocean mixing as well as intense biological activity. We examined <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratios</b> of DIC, total alkalinity (TA), and nutrients (NO 3 , PO 4 3 &minus; and Si(OH) 4 ) data during biological removal in the Mississippi River plume and adjacent continental shelf in June 2003 and August 2004 with biological removals defined as the difference between measured values and values predicted on the basis of conservative mixing determined using a multi-endmember mixing model. Despite complex physical and biogeochemical influences, relationships between DIC and nutrients were strongly dependent on salinity range and geographic location, and influenced by biological removal. Lower C/Si and N/Si ratios in one nearshore area were attributed to a potential silicate source induced by water exchange with coastal salt marshes. When net biological uptake was separated from river-ocean mixing and the impact of marshes and bays excluded, <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratios</b> of C/N/Si were similar to the Redfield ratios, thus supporting the applicability of the Redfield-type C/N/Si ratios as a principle in river-plume biogeochemical models...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to obtain data on the {{efficiency}} of nitric oxide (NO) reduction by reburning under oxy-fuel conditions. The work {{was carried out in}} a 100 kW test facility fired with propane. The data were analyzed by means of a combustion model, which included {{a detailed description of the}} reburning chemistry. The importance of several combustion parameters on the reburning efficiency was studied: inlet oxygen concentration, flue gas recycle <b>ratio,</b> temperature, and <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratio.</b> The inlet oxygen concentration was kept between 25 and 37 vol % and the burner <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratio</b> between 0. 7 and 1. 15. NO was injected in the oxidizer. As expected, similar to air-firing, reburning in oxy-fuel is favored by substoichiometric conditions. A decrease in combustion temperature, caused by a lowered <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratio,</b> is shown to be advantageous for reduction of NO under oxy-fuel conditions. The effect of inlet oxygen concentration on reburning is not significant as long as the combustion conditions are fuel-lean. However, the amount of recycled flue gas, which increases with decreasing oxygen content, significantly improves the total reduction. Instead, when the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratio</b> is decreased, the recycle flow of the flue gas is reduced, which, to some extent, counteracts the otherwise positive effect of fuel-rich conditions in the flame zone in oxy-fuel conditions. Thus, during oxygen-rich combustion, the total reburning efficiency in oxy-fuel combustion is superior to once-through reburning in air-firing, but during substoichiometric conditions, the reduction in air and oxy-fuel combustion is comparable...|$|R
