5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Labor's fourth consecutive defeat in the 2004 federal election it was widely speculated that Gillard might challenge Jenny Macklin for the deputy leadership, {{but she did not}} do so. Gillard had been spoken of as a potential future leader of the party for some years, but never <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> leadership contest. After Mark Latham resigned as Labor Leader in January 2005, Gillard appeared on ABC's Australian Story in March 2006, after which an Ipsos Mackay poll conducted for Network Ten's Meet the Press found that more respondents would prefer Gillard to be Labor Leader; she polled 32% compared with Beazley's 25% and Kevin Rudd's 18%. Although she had significant cross-factional support, she announced on 25 January 2005 that she would not contest the leadership, allowing Beazley to be elected unopposed.|$|E
5|$|Spruyt {{was the son}} of Jacobus Spuyt (1796–1839), a Dutch medical doctor, and Antje Landskroon. Both the Spruyt and Landskroon {{families}} <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{tradition of}} medical practice, and three of the four brothers Spruyt had were doctors in the Netherlands. Spruyt himself trained as a lawyer at Leiden University, but probably did not finish his studies. He went on to work as a schoolteacher in the village of Oosterwolde in the north of the Netherlands. It was here that professor U.G. Lauts recruited him for South Africa in 1851. Lauts was {{one of a group of}} Dutchmen, interested in the development of good education in the new Boer settlements in South Africa. As such, Spruyt was one of the many Dutch immigrants that settled in the new Boer republics around the middle of the nineteenth century.|$|E

5|$|The predominate storyline {{heading into}} the event was the rivalry between A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle, both members of The Angle Alliance. On the February14 episode of Impact!, TNA held the scripted wedding of Angle's real-life wife Karen Angle and Styles despite Angle and Karen still being married on-screen. Afterwards, Karen and Angle {{separated}} in the storyline on the March13 episode of Impact!. TNA continued to build the situation with Angle attempting to reconcile with Karen on the May15 episode of Impact!; TNA began to phase out the marriage between Styles and Karen also. Karen refused Angle's request on the May22 episode of Impact!, leading to Angle turning on and assaulting Styles later in the episode due to his jealousy of the affection Karen showed for Styles. This led to a match between the two at Slammiversary which Styles won after a distraction by Karen. The two faced in a Lumberjack match on the June12 episode of Impact!, which Angle won before it ended in a brawl between Styles, Angle, Tomko, Christian Cage, Rhino, Abyss, and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). Afterwards, Team 3D and the team of Cage and Rhino {{became involved in the}} feud with Team 3D joining Angle, while Cage and Rhino sided with Styles. The two teams then fought in a Full Metal Mayhem at Victory Road, which the team of Angle and Team 3D won. The teams fought again on the July24 episode of Impact!, this time in a Six Man Tag Team Elimination Tables match, which Angle and Team 3D also won. On the July31 episode of Impact!, while Styles <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ring surrounded by a steel cage, Angle attacked Styles from behind and slammed him back-first into the mat, rendering him unconscious. As a result of this action, Styles challenged Angle to a Last Man Standing match at Hard Justice; Angle accepted the challenge.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, William Powell, {{at the time}} an SBC employee, {{developed}} a rather simple strategy {{to take control of}} the SBC: elect the SBC president for ten consecutive years. The SBC president appoints the committees that name other committees that nominate trustees for the denomination's institutions, including the seminaries. Trustees of institutions served five years and were eligible for reelection once. Therefore, by occupying the presidency for ten years one could ensure that all appointments, nominations and new seminary hires <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> line of succession trailing back to the president.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Type 94 {{was based on the}} British Carden-Loyd Mark VIb tankettes.

The engine was an air-cooled petrol motor that developed 35 hp at 2,500 rpm. Like many armored vehicles intended to operate in hot conditions, the engine was given asbestos insulation to protect the occupants from its heat.

25|$|Janis {{remained}} at Woodstock {{for the remainder}} of the festival. She is said to have really enjoyed Sly and The Family Stone's performance immediately after hers. Starting at approximately 3:00a.m. on Monday, August 18, Joplin was among many Woodstock performers who <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> circle behind Crosby, Stills & Nash during their performance, which was the first time anyone at Woodstock ever had heard the group perform with Neil Young. This information was published by David Crosby in 1988. Later in the morning of August 18, Joplin and Joan Baez sat in Joe Cocker's van and witnessed Hendrix's close-of-show performance, according to Baez's memoir And a Voice to Sing With (1989).|$|E
25|$|Paneb {{was accused}} of many charges of sexual assault and adultery, though there are many ambiguities in the text which make {{the exact nature of}} the charges unclear.

Though Černý seems to think that the door-keepers might have served the role of bailiffs, A.G. McDowell, a prominent Egyptologist in the study of Deir el-Medina, speculates that the door-keepers' legal function was small, and that Aapehty only testified to them because they <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> public part of the worksite.|$|E
