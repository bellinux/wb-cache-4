5000|$|Blue Ridge Dam is a {{hydraulic}} earth-fill type dam 167 ft high and 1000 ft long, {{and has a}} generating capacity of 22 megawatts. [...] The dam's gate-controlled <b>saddle</b> <b>spillway</b> - [...] which is separated from the main dam by a small hill - [...] can discharge up to [...] of water per second. The dam's powerhouse utilizes a 192 ft concrete intake tower, and a 14 ft-diameter steel penstock 1050 ft long that conveys water from the tower to the primary turbine. A 180 ft surge tank relieves pressure brought about by rapid gate closures.|$|E

5000|$|The $46.1-million {{project was}} {{completed}} in 1978. [...] The dam was constructed as compacted earthfill embankment with gated outlet works and a 1,500-foot long uncontrolled <b>saddle</b> <b>spillway.</b> [...] The top of the dam is at 2821.0 feet of elevation above sea level. [...] The specifications put {{the top of the}} maximum pool at 2814.2 feet, the top of the flood control pool at 2779.0 feet, the top of the conservation pool at 2763.5 feet, and the top of the inactive pool at 2726.0 feet. [...] The conservation pool was designed to hold 117,500 acre-feet of water, with 76,200 acre-feet designated to be available as a water supply. [...] The flood pool capacity was designed for 229,500 acre-feet, while absolute maximum capacity of the lake was set at 618,500 acre feet. [...] During the first full year of operation in 1979, the Corps remained optimistic and declared, [...] "The optimum visitation for the project is 600,000 annual visitors and will be reached in 2014." ...|$|E
