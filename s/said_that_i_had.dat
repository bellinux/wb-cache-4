[...] Without asking for her comment, the publication asserted that she was dying. Radner wrote in It's Always Something: [...] "They found an old photo of me looking frightened from a 'Saturday Night Live' sketch and blew that up to make the point. What they did probably sold newspapers, {{but it had a}} devastating effect on my family and my friends. [...] It forced [...] Gene [...] to compose a press release to respond. [...] He <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, had had surgery, and my prognosis was good. [...] The Enquirer doesn't like good news, so the Gilda Radner story stopped running." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{started on}} a run, saying, sarcasticallyfor I was always fond of sarcasm, and it was <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a most neat gift that way: ...|$|E
60|$|MAGGIE [bravely]. When they <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{been run}} {{after they were}} {{misleading}} you. I'm without charm; nobody has ever been after me.|$|R

6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> already <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{no secrets}} from you," [...] he repeated. [...] "The {{envelope}} is open. See for yourself what is inclosed in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you had <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> read it {{a hundred}} and fifty times," [...] {{returned}} Lumley, [...] "you would have been still under the mark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madame Muller {{went down}} for lunch," [...] Felicia answered. [...] "I <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a headache, and stole {{up here on}} the chance of seeing you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah,--I wish I knew. I {{should have}} <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen every {{shilling}} {{that came into}} the house; but I know nothing of this cheque,--whence it came." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Afraid? Oh!" [...] cried Lady Lundie, distrusting the {{evidence}} of her own senses. [...] "You can't <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> evidently misapprehended you. You didn't really say, afraid?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you wanted}} to {{convince}} me of," [...] rejoined Ian, [...] "has {{nothing to do with}} the question. It is what you <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to do with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{damage has}} been already done," [...] said the Doctor, eagerly. [...] "I have {{received}} the Bishop's rebuke,--a rebuke in which he <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> brought scandal upon the diocese." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam, I <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> decided, and all {{the women}} in the world will not change my mind in this way or in that. Jodd, do my bidding." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When De Aquila had gone, Hugh {{would have}} thanked me for saving their lives; but the Lady Ælueva <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done it {{only for the}} sake of {{receiving}} the Manor.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did the {{differential}} calculus, sir, and then Mr. Merton <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better {{stick to the}} mechanical application of mathematics instead of going on any farther; that was two years ago." ...|$|E
60|$|There! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done. The spark {{is under}} my shoe. If in 'losing my temper' <b>I</b> <b>have</b> 'lost my music,' don't {{let it be}} <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lost my friend by my own fault and choice also.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wisely spoken, Mlle. Crystal," [...] rejoined de Marmont. [...] "Have <b>I</b> not <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{two dozen}} {{soldiers}} with me--all {{trained to do}} their duty? Why should M. le Comte allow them to lay hands upon you and on Mme. la Duchesse?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{made my way}} to Mr. Waterbrook, and <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{believed}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{the pleasure}} of seeing an old schoolfellow there.|$|R
6000|$|... "What did I say? I <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{many things}} that I valued greatly, but that I had one thing that I valued more than gold or houses--more even than my right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{minute he}} <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a queer feelin' at the pit o' my stummick--I did, sure thing. 'It's {{a little early}} for a call,' I says, 'and I ain't in Sunday clothes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} not," [...] said Harry. [...] "Why, what d'ye think they <b>said?</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone on {{as well as}} all the Mays, and they trusted I should still, and be a credit to my profession." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lord Nidderdale,' said Sir Felix, 'I <b>have</b> already <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not got {{the money}} about me.

6000|$|It will be <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> drawn an {{impossible}} character, and depicted {{a woman who}} served both God and Mammon. To this accusation I will not plead, but will ask my accusers whether in their life's travail they have met no such ladies as Lady Staveley? ...|$|R
6000|$|... --I <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{lost the}} faith, Stephen answered, {{but not that}} I had lost self-respect. What kind of liberation would that be to forsake an absurdity which is logical and {{coherent}} and to embrace one which is illogical and incoherent? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I did not advise him. I only <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{been talking}} to her about it. If he were {{to say to you}} that he had been recommending my mother to do this or that, you would not take it amiss?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, Monsieur Kennedy, I {{have the}} king's {{order to take}} you to the palace. He asked me several {{questions}} about you this morning. I <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not yet seen you, but that you were riding over here today, and he said: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{has been}} a great deal more of the latter than the former. I say so to you, but of course it is not to be <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> so. <b>I</b> cannot go forth to the world {{complaining}} of a young lady's conduct to me. It is a matter in which a man must not tell the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 2: Mr. Coleridge called Shakspeare [...] "the myriad-minded man," [...] [Greek: auaz muzioyous]--" [...] a phrase," [...] said he, [...] "which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{borrowed}} from a Greek monk, who applies it to a patriarch of Constantinople. <b>I</b> might <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> reclaimed, rather than borrowed, it, for {{it seems to}} belong to Shakspeare de jure singulari, et ex privilegio naturae."

6000|$|... "To what end? It may be. It may be. You know I said, {{when you}} told me of these things dear God! but that was {{scarcely}} a score of hours ago!--I <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not your faith. Well--at any rate {{there is nothing to}} do now...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My name, sir, is Sir William Weston," [...] he began. I {{had heard}} of the name before, and knew him to be a man of wealth, and family, and note. I took off my hat, and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> much honour in meeting Sir William Weston.|$|E
60|$|Then I mustered up my courage, and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{known from}} the first would be difficult.|$|R

6000|$|Before {{he could}} proceed further, he {{was stopped by}} the astonishment shown by the Barmecide.
