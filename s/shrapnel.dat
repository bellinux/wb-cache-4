5|$|In 1981, a Lockheed L-1011, {{operating}} as Eastern Airlines Flight 935, suffered a similar failure of its tail-mounted number two engine. The <b>shrapnel</b> from that engine inflicted damage {{on all four}} of its hydraulic systems, which were also close together in the tail structure. Fluid was lost {{in three of the}} four systems. The fourth hydraulic system was impacted with <b>shrapnel,</b> but not punctured. The hydraulic pressure remaining in that fourth system enabled the captain to land the plane safely with some limited use of the outboard spoilers, the inboard ailerons, and the horizontal stabilizer, plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries.|$|E
50|$|Other factors causing {{unintended}} detonations are e.g. flame spread, heat radiation, {{and impact}} of <b>shrapnels.</b>|$|R

5|$|In a {{makeshift}} hospital at Plateros, Scout Alfonso and Ranger Fisher were quickly put into surgery. The <b>shrapnel</b> {{was removed from}} Alfonso's abdomen, and {{he was expected to}} recover if returned to American lines. Fisher's <b>shrapnel</b> was also removed, but with limited supplies and widespread damage to both his stomach and intestines, it was decided more extensive surgery would need to be completed in an American hospital. Mucci ordered that an airstrip be built in a field next to Plateros so that a plane could airlift him to American lines. Some Scouts and freed prisoners stayed behind to construct the airstrip.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Syrian Civil War, Palmyra {{experienced}} widespread looting and damage by combatants. In 2013, the façade of the Temple of Bel sustained a large hole from mortar fire, and colonnade columns have been damaged by <b>shrapnel.</b> According to Maamoun Abdulkarim, the Syrian Army positioned its troops in some archaeological-site areas, while Syrian opposition fighters positioned themselves in gardens around the city.|$|E
5|$|Gallaher's unit {{fought in}} the Battle of Messines, near La Basse Ville, and in August and September 1917 they trained for the {{upcoming}} Passchendaele offensive. In the attack on Gravenstafel Spur on 4October 1917 Gallaher was wounded by a piece of <b>shrapnel</b> that penetrated through his helmet, and he died later that day at the 3rd Australian Casualty Clearing Station, Gravenstafel Spur. He was 43 years old.|$|E
50|$|The French {{took the}} brunt of the {{casualties}} among ISAF forces, with 10 dead—8 killed by bullets or <b>shrapnels,</b> one by a bladed weapon, and the last one in a road accident as he rode to the battle. 23 ISAF soldiers were also wounded, among whom 21 were French and 2 were Afghan.|$|R
5000|$|In 1814, the British Government {{recognized}} <b>Shrapnel's</b> contribution by awarding him £1200 (UK£ [...] in [...] ) a {{year for}} life. Bureaucracy however prevented him from receiving the full benefit of this award. He {{was appointed to the}} office of Colonel-Commandant, Royal Artillery, on 6 March 1827. He rose to the rank of lieutenant-general on 10 January 1837.|$|R

5|$|Hermann Schoemann was {{undamaged}} by British aircraft, but {{was repeatedly}} {{struck in the}} stern by 20mm cannon shells from the defending German fighters. Later that afternoon, Vice Admiral (Vizeadmiral) Otto Ciliax, commander of the battleship flotilla, {{was transferred to the}} ship after his temporary flagship, the destroyer , was disabled by a premature detonation in one of her guns that sent <b>shrapnel</b> into the machinery spaces.|$|E
5|$|Kerr's first {{marriage}} was to Squadron Leader Anthony Bartley RAF on 29 November 1945. They had two daughters, Melanie Jane (born 27 December 1947) and Francesca Ann (born 20 December 1951 and subsequently {{married to the}} actor John <b>Shrapnel).</b> The marriage was troubled, owing to Bartley's jealousy of his wife's fame and financial success, and because her career often took her away from home. They divorced in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Lock {{underwent}} fifteen separate operations {{over the}} following three months to remove <b>shrapnel</b> and other metal fragments from his wounds. For the following three months he remained at Halton recuperating from his injuries, leaving on only one occasion to travel on crutches and in full uniform to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI presented him with his DSO, DFC and Bar. He was also Mentioned in Despatches in March 1941.|$|E

5000|$|Vincent Jeffries at AllMusic gave Michael Lee Firkins {{four stars}} out of five, praising Firkins' unique playing and guitar tone, and {{suggesting}} that he was [...] "one of the best artists (if not the best)" [...] from <b>Shrapnel's</b> 1980s-early 90s shred line-up. He also highlighted [...] "Déjà Blues", [...] "Space Crickets" [...] and [...] "Laughing Stacks" [...] as [...] "instrumental classics".|$|R
50|$|After {{switching}} {{labels to}} <b>Shrapnel's</b> jazz-oriented counterpart, Tone Center Records, {{he returned to}} his familiar style with Hyperacuity (2000), which still stands as some of his most prominent experimentation with jazz fusion. After a highly troubled recording process for Extraction (2003)—a collaboration with drummer Dennis Chambers and bassist Victor Wooten—he took an extended hiatus from recording solo material until the release of his eighth studio album, Sound Proof, in 2008.|$|R
5|$|Of the 332 {{people on}} board, 64 were rescued. Most {{of the crew}} and {{passengers}} were asleep {{at the time of}} attack and had little chance to escape. It was estimated that up to 200 people may have been alive at the time Centaur submerged. Several who made it off the ship later died from <b>shrapnel</b> wounds or burns; others were unable to find support and drowned.|$|E
5|$|The {{airplane}} {{struck the}} Belaire, a 42-story condominium tower at 524 East 72nd Street, at approximately 30 stories above the ground. The plane hit the apartment owned by Dr. Parviz Benhuri {{and his wife}} Ilana, the latter of whom was seated {{in the room when}} the plane crashed and sustained <b>shrapnel</b> injuries and burns. Her housekeeper was also present and helped her escape.|$|E
5|$|The insurgents {{responded by}} {{throwing}} a grenade at the Marines. The two Marines with Sgt. Peralta {{tried to get}} out of the room but could not. Sgt. Peralta was still conscious on the floor and despite his wounds was able to reach for the grenade and pull it under his body absorbing the majority of the lethal blast and <b>shrapnel</b> which killed him instantly, but saved the lives of his fellow marines.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Shrapnel's</b> Hotspur in Henry IV in the Royal Shakespeare Company's {{critically}} acclaimed 2008 production {{was described as}} 'thrillingly charismatic'. He also has appeared on stage in 2011 in Terence Rattigan’s The Deep Blue Sea performed at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. He {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "Before going in you set a high bar for yourself, but you’ve just got to get into rehearsals, do the work and hope it comes together".|$|R
50|$|The company {{management}} {{was aware that}} a such order would come and had investigated different business opportunities. The owners considered foundation of a namely Russian ammunition factory in Saint Petersburg or finding a Russian buyer for the company; neither of the options gained response. New markets for <b>shrapnels</b> were investigated in Romania and Italy, and Kone ja Silta went {{into contact with the}} Swedish AB Diesels Motorer investigating possibility to start diesel engine production. These efforts did not lead to results.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>shrapnel's</b> {{relatively}} flat trajectory (it depended {{mainly on}} the shell's velocity for its lethality, and was lethal only in the forward direction) meant {{that it could not}} strike trained troops who avoided open spaces and instead used dead ground (dips), shelters, trenches, buildings, and trees for cover. It was of no use in destroying buildings or shelters. Hence, it was replaced during World War I by the high-explosive shell, which exploded its fragments in all directions (and thus more difficult to avoid) and could be fired by high-angle weapons, such as howitzers.|$|R
5|$|A lone Japanese {{soldier was}} able to fire off three mortar rounds toward the main gate. Although members of F Company quickly located the soldier and killed him, several Rangers, Scouts, and POWs were wounded in the attack. Battalion surgeon Capt. James Fisher was mortally injured in the stomach and was carried to the nearby village of Balincari. Scout Alfred Alfonso had a <b>shrapnel</b> wound to his abdomen. Scout Lt. Tom Rounsaville and Ranger Pvt. 1st Class Jack Peters were also wounded by the barrage.|$|E
5|$|After {{rest and}} recovery, the {{regiment}} {{moved to the}} Fromelles sector of the front in mid-October. Here Kippenberger volunteered for sniper duty despite not being known for his accuracy as a marksman. He served in this capacity until he was badly wounded in the arm by <b>shrapnel</b> on 10 November 1916. Although he eventually recovered from his wound, {{at the time it}} was serious enough that he was repatriated to New Zealand and discharged from the NZEF in April 1917.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking part}} in the Gallipoli Campaign, Playford and his {{battalion}} left for France on 15 March 1916. He fought on the Western Front and was shot and wounded on 20 October, evacuated to London, and kept out of action for a year. Playford endured many operations during this time to remove the <b>shrapnel</b> that had penetrated his body, although some of it remained within him, and his hearing was permanently damaged. Turning down an offer for a staff job in India, Playford returned to his battalion in October 1917 and continued fighting in Belgium and France.|$|E
5000|$|... “At about 12:06 pm, a {{motorcade}} consisting, among others, {{of three}} limousines, entered Krakowska Street. When all cars passed a house number 47, a bomb exploded, {{hidden in a}} kilometer post. Two people were injured - a girl, who was walking past, and a miner, who was returning from celebrations. <b>Shrapnels</b> also destroyed one of the limousines, but not the one with Gomulka” - wrote Adam Dziuba, historian of Katowice office of the Institute of National Remembrance. The girl was partially paralysed, and the miner later died in hospital.|$|R
50|$|From 1968 until 1974 Bohrer was {{literary}} {{editor of the}} Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Partly because of differences of opinion with his successor, Marcel Reich-Ranicki, Bohrer went for this paper as a correspondent to England in 1975. He {{was appointed to the}} Chair for Modern German Literary History at Bielefeld University. He succeeded Hans Schwab-Felisch in 1984 as editor of Merkur, along with Kurt Scheel since 1991. Bohrer is now emeritus at Bielefeld. Most of Bohrer's output have been (collections of) essays. He also published an autobiography in two volumes: Granatsplitter (<b>Shrapnels)</b> (2012) and Jetzt (Now) (2017).|$|R
5000|$|Altwegg has resided since 1992 in Kreuzlingen, {{being invited}} to play concerts in Europe and the United States, often of chamber music. In May 2004, Altwegg played as the first foreign soloist with Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra in Bagdad, and {{teaching}} a master class at the music academy in Bagdad. The event {{was supported by the}} Embassy of Switzerland, The Swiss Foreign Office and the Ministry of Culture of Iraque. It was covered in the book <b>Shrapnels.</b> En marge de Bagdad by [...] in 2005. In 2005 and 2007. Altwegg toured in South America, playing in Columbia, Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala.|$|R
5|$|During the Battle of Uman (15 July – 8 August 1941) Strachwitz {{received}} {{a head injury}} on 29 July and was hit again by <b>shrapnel</b> in the arm the next day. He received first aid {{in the field and}} stayed with his men. The injured arm became infected and he had to receive medical attention in a field hospital on 10 August. He released himself again on 12 August returning to the regiment which had been led by Oberleutnant von Kleist during his absence.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Chiswick {{was bombed}} repeatedly, with both {{incendiary}} and high explosive bombs. Falling anti-aircraft shells and <b>shrapnel</b> also caused damage. The first V-2 rocket to hit London fell on Staveley Road, Chiswick, at 6.43pm on 8 September 1944, killing three people, injuring 22 others and causing extensive damage to surrounding trees and buildings. Six houses were demolished by the rocket {{and many more}} suffered damage. There is a memorial where the rocket fell on Staveley Road, and a War Memorial at {{the east end of}} Turnham Green.|$|E
5|$|For most {{conspicuous}} bravery near Richebourg L'Avoue on 18 May 1915. With a bombing party of 10 men, who voluntarily undertook this duty, he conveyed {{a supply of}} 96 bombs to within 20 yards of the enemy's position over exceptionally dangerous ground, after the attempts of two other parties had failed. Lieutenant Smyth succeeded in taking the bombs to the desired position {{with the aid of}} two of his men (the other eight having been killed or wounded), and to effect his purpose he had to swim a stream, being exposed the whole time to howitzer, <b>shrapnel,</b> machine-gun and rifle fire.|$|E
5000|$|I {{feel all}} the senses {{in my body}} that I don’t want to feel, all the {{unwanted}} pain. I really got depressed. And my (burned) skin (including face) is extra sensitive. When it’s hot I feel the heat and when it’s cold I also feel very cold. My left foot was shattered in 10 places. It’s all held together by screws. Hopefully, after 20 weeks (since Nov. 13) the bones will heal; I’m still under heavy medication. And I still take pain relievers. The pain is terrible.Three days ago (Jan. 26), I had two <b>shrapnels</b> removed from my body. They were all concrete nails.|$|R
30|$|The {{death and}} woundings took place {{due to the}} direct blast or blast {{reflection}} and the primary and secondary fragmentation effect. In addition to the fragmentation/shrapnel effect, broken windows and concerete etc. are the causes for severely wounding and deaths too. The <b>shrapnels</b> from the grenade body and the secondary fragments from environment travel at air by the effect of detonation blast and give fatal damages. Glass causes many of the secondary blast injuries (up to 50 % of all blast injuries). Victims that are peppered with glass are often difficult to distinguish from victims that are peppered with glass and have penetrating injuries (White et al., 2008; Wong et al., 1997).|$|R
30|$|The main {{fragmentation}} {{effect of}} the explosion, primary fragmentation, comes from the <b>shrapnels.</b> The particles propelled from the explosion seat and the environment is the secondary fragmentation. The blast mostly makes the buildings collaped and windows broke. The velocity of the blast travel in the air takes the free particles on and travels far away with tremendous speed and energy creating pressure of thousands of pascals which causes fatal wounds on the body. As {{the distance from the}} blast epicenter increases, the effect of blast reduces and the effect of fragments and debris propelled by the explosive becomes more important. Conventional military explosives may create multiple fragments with supersonic initial velocities (Glover, 2002).|$|R
