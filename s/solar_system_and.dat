5|$|Earth's axis of {{rotation}} is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface. The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> <b>and</b> {{the largest of the}} four terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|Gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are giant planets {{primarily}} {{composed of}} {{hydrogen and helium}} and are the most massive planets in the Solar System.

5|$|The {{outer limit}} of the Oort cloud defines the cosmographical {{boundary}} of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> <b>and</b> {{the extent of the}} Sun's Hill sphere. The outer Oort cloud is only loosely bound to the <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> <b>and</b> thus is easily affected by the gravitational pull both of passing stars and of the Milky Way itself. These forces occasionally dislodge comets from their orbits within the cloud and send them toward the inner Solar System. Based on their orbits, most of the short-period comets may come from the scattered disc, but some may still have originated from the Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|Those {{relatively}} rare comets with orbits of about 10,000AU have probably gone through {{one or more}} orbits through the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> <b>and</b> have had their orbits drawn inward by {{the gravity of the}} planets.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Master thesis is to {{evaluate}} the possibility of use of autonomous <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> in projects of development aid. In {{the first part of}} the thesis there is a literary review which defines the basic context of development aid, the characteristics of <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> the possibility of use for energy security. Another part describes a model project in which the attention is focused on autonomous <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> defining the criteria for evaluating the appropriateness of their use. The next step is a multi-criteria analysis using expert evaluation criteria. It also evaluates the economic effectiveness of alternative variants of <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> risk analysis. In conclusion, the results obtained are discussed and recommendations are suggested...|$|R

5|$|All {{projections}} {{of the future of}} the Earth, the <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> <b>and</b> the Universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must increase over time. Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel and burn out. Close encounters gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{conjecture}} {{that the}} matter composing the Oort cloud formed {{closer to the}} Sun and was scattered far into space by the gravitational effects of the giant planets early in the Solar System's evolution. Although no confirmed direct observations of the Oort cloud have been made, {{it may be the}} source of all long-period and Halley-type comets entering the inner <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> <b>and</b> many of the centaurs and Jupiter-family comets as well.|$|E

5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> <b>and</b> it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Boron is a {{chemical}} element with symbolB and atomic number5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae {{and not by}} stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the <b>Solar</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.|$|E
5|$|Callisto (Jupiter IV) is {{the fourth}} and last Galilean moon, and is the second largest of the four, and at 4820.6 {{kilometers}} in diameter, it is the third largest moon in the <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> <b>and</b> barely smaller than Mercury, though {{only a third of}} the latter's mass. It is named after the Greek mythological nymph Callisto, a lover of Zeus who was a daughter of the Arkadian King Lykaon and a hunting companion of the goddess Artemis. The moon does not form part of the orbital resonance that affects three inner Galilean satellites and thus does not experience appreciable tidal heating. Callisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of rock and ices, which makes it the least dense of the Galilean moons. It {{is one of the most}} heavily cratered satellites in the <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> <b>and</b> one major feature is a basin around 3000km wide called Valhalla.|$|E

5|$|The {{interplanetary medium}} {{is home to}} at least two disc-like regions of cosmic dust. The first, the zodiacal dust cloud, lies in the inner <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> <b>and</b> causes the zodiacal light. It was likely formed by {{collisions}} within the asteroid belt brought on by gravitational interactions with the planets. The second dust cloud extends from about 10AU to about 40AU, and was probably created by similar collisions within the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|The {{planet is}} {{estimated}} to have 10 times the mass and two to four times the diameter of Earth. An object with the same diameter as Neptune has not been excluded by previous surveys. An infrared survey by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in 2009 allowed for a Neptune-sized object beyond 700 AU. A similar study in 2014 focused on possible higher-mass bodies in the outer <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> <b>and</b> ruled out Jupiter-mass objects out to 26,000 AU.|$|E

5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{initially}} taken as postulates, but {{today there are}} efforts to test each of them.

Also, general relativity has passed stringent tests on the scale of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> <b>and</b> binary stars.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} {{during the latter}} half of the 20th century of more objects within the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> <b>and</b> large objects around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There were particular disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a belt, or if it was large enough to generate energy by the thermonuclear fusion of deuterium.|$|E
