25|$|Lister {{continued}} to develop improved methods of antisepsis and asepsis when he realised that infection {{could be better}} avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place. This led {{to the rise of}} sterile surgery. Lister instructed surgeons under his responsibility to wear clean gloves and wash their hands in 5% carbolic solution before and after operations, and had surgical instruments washed in the same solution. He also introduced the <b>steam</b> <b>steriliser</b> to sterilize equipment. His discoveries paved the way for a dramatic expansion to the capabilities of the surgeon; for his contributions he is often regarded as the father of modern surgery. These three crucial advances - the adoption of a scientific methodology toward surgical operations, the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of sterilised equipment - laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today.|$|E

50|$|Philips AVENT is {{a company}} based in England {{manufacturing}} baby bottles, breast pumps, and other baby feeding and health accessories. AVENT came from the sub brand Avent Naturally which was launched by a Company called Cannon Rubber (est.1936). The Brand was created in 1984 to launch {{a new type of}} baby bottle that was short with a wide neck. Avent was the first baby feeding company to produce teats from odourless and tasteless silicone as well as other patented innovations such a <b>steam</b> and microwave <b>steriliser</b> and piston-free breast Pump. In 2005 Charterhouse Venture Capital bought the company, then known as Cannon Avent from the Atkin family (second generation owners.) They then sold it in 2006 to Philips and the company became Philips AVENT.|$|R
40|$|Previous work in {{the area}} of {{improving}} the performance of steam system in palm oil mills can be found in books and journals published by Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB). However, very little data has been published on operating experiences and scientific facts as well as economic aspects of back pressure vessel system. The data is also often found to be contradictory with the actual industrial requirement in handling pressure fluctuation of steam line in palm oil mill. Furthermore, there is very scarce literature on proper sizing methods for back pressure vessel. The design of back pressure vessel in palm oil mills is still largely based on undeveloped approaches and is carried out by individuals lacking exposure to the palm oil milling industry. The size of back pressure vessel varies between 1 to 12 m 3 and the choice is usually dictated by the manufacturer and the capacity of steam consumed by turbine. But, this size is always found to be insufficient to control the <b>steam</b> distribution to <b>sterilisers</b> and other heating processe...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to find an optimal process for a manually operated jacketed <b>steam</b> <b>steriliser,</b> which is mainly used in developing countries. The experiments were focussed on the steam penetration into a textile test pack and the drying procedure. The performance of the various test cycles was evaluated against the requirements in the European standards for large steam sterilisers and the validation of steam sterilisers, by measuring the temperature and pressure in the steriliser and textile test packs. The standard sterilisation process as recommended by the manufacturer of the <b>steam</b> <b>steriliser</b> did not fulfil the requirements by far and could not be considered as a proper sterilisation process. The optimum process for sterilisation of a worst case load (textile in top and bottom perforated sterilisation drums) was found to be: 20 minutes steam flushing at atmospheric pressure, three times a slow pressure build-up to 300 kPa followed by a drop to 100 kPa and finally a slow pressure build-up to the sterilisation pressure. This process has however not been proven suitable for the sterilisation of hollow medical devices. The optimum drying result was obtained by the use of an external condensation vessel. The condensation vessel also contributed to cost effective operation by it's simple design and low water consumption...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} how dental handpieces are decontaminated and maintained in general dental practice. Design Observational survey. Setting The survey {{was carried out}} in general dental practice in Scotland. Survey visits ran from January 2003 until the end of March 2004. Methods Data were collected by interview and observation in 179 dental surgeries in Scotland. Results In virtually all surgeries, handpieces were cleaned before disinfection or autoclaving (99 %; n = 177), most commonly by wiping the external surface with a cloth impregnated with disinfectant. Most surgeries lubricated their handpieces after cleaning and before sterilisation (91 %; n = 162), although a number of surgeries (24 %; n = 42) also lubricated their handpieces after sterilisation. In the majority (97 %; n = 174) of dental surgeries, all handpieces were autoclaved after use, most frequently (89 %; n = 160) in a bowl and instrument steriliser. In 38 surgeries (21 %), handpieces were being wrapped (paper pouches) before sterilisation in bowl and instrument sterilisers. A minority of surgeries (20 %; n = 36) had a dedicated handpiece for surgical procedures. Conclusions The majority of dental handpieces are manually cleaned externally with a disinfectant impregnated cloth and processed in a type N (bowl and instrument) bench top <b>steam</b> <b>steriliser.</b> Handpieces are lubricated with non-water soluble lubricants at different stages of reprocessing, indicating clarification is required in this area. More work is required by manufacturers to establish a validated cleaning and lubrication process to facilitate the sterilisation of handpieces...|$|E
