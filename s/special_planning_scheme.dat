40|$|Many {{studies of}} urban {{regeneration}} describe strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> {{based on the}} experiences of practitioners gleaned {{from a variety of}} projects in several cities of the world. Whilst this literature provides a general understanding of strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes,</b> none explores what is happening and what is planned to happen in the context of South Korea. Our research framework was designed to present formal strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> to support urban regeneration within regional contexts. This paper identifies urban regeneration <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> for Mixed-use development (MXD), based on a literature review of Korean refereed papers, and examines <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> via an expert survey. The literature survey includes 29 papers published by three major institutes in architecture and urban design in South Korea. In terms of strategic <b>planning,</b> the <b>schemes</b> have the potential to impact on MXD. Various urban development experts participated in the survey, and the data collected reflect consensus about strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> in regional contexts. The results generated 41 strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> and 12 strategic planning factors via Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). The results enable us to explore meaningful directions for the future. This paper provides an understanding of key <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> in urban contexts in South Korea as well as of strategic planning for the future MXD projects...|$|R

As a scheme that follows the State-mandated structure it contains the following key components: a Strategic framework (Part 3), Priority infrastructure plan (Part 4), Tables of assessment (Part 5), Zones (Part 6), Overlays (Part 8), Other codes (Part 9), Definitions (Schedule 1), Mapping (Schedules 2 and 3) and <b>Planning</b> <b>scheme</b> policies (Schedule 6).|$|R
50|$|The Economic Survey (2007-08) {{emphasized}} the need for effective financial monitoring of the <b>Plan</b> <b>Schemes.</b> The Finance Minister in his Budget Speech (2008-09) announced {{the establishment of a}} comprehensive Decision Support System and Management Information System. The 11th Plan Document also recognized the deficiencies in the existing accounting system for the <b>Plan</b> <b>Schemes</b> and its inability to support informed planning, budgeting and effective monitoring of these schemes. It also underlined the need for a consolidated financial information system for the <b>Plan</b> <b>Schemes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{planning}} matters, VCAT {{must make}} its {{decisions based on}} {{the law and the}} requirements of the individual council's <b>planning</b> <b>scheme,</b> balancing competing objectives such as neighbourhood character or urban consolidation.

VCAT has no say in what goes into a <b>planning</b> <b>scheme</b> and is not involved with the making of planning laws. It is, however, required to apply them.|$|R

30|$|This {{paper is}} {{structured}} as follows: {{after a short}} section on literature review (Section 2), a brief summary of Japan’s developments in the post-war period is presented {{for those who are}} not familiar with the country’s modern history (Section 3). Following these, an extensive review of national-level transport <b>planning</b> <b>scheme</b> is carried out (Section 4). As little literature and information is available elsewhere in English, detailed information is presented in this part, consequently making this part lengthy: readers familiar with Japanese <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> may skip this part; however, this forms a basis for the next sections. In Section 5, a comparison among the <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> for different transport modes is carried out. The imbalance between the <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> of the land-based modes are demonstrated making use of the cases triggered by natural disasters in Section 6, while Section 7 provides the conclusion.|$|R

40|$|In 1996, the Victorian Kennett Government {{embarked}} on an ambitious experiment on the State&# 039;s land use planning system. The government amended the Planning and Environment Act 1987 to introduce the Victoria Planning Provisions (VPP). These provisions introduced an unprecedented amount and type of standardisation into Victorian <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> and sought to remove a strong orientation towards local variation and influence. &# 039;A Failed Experiment&# 039; reports on a project that sought to evaluate {{the performance of the}} new format <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> against the objectives of the Victoria Planning Provisions. It also makes limited comparisons between the performance of the new format <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> and the <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> which existed between 1988 until their replacement by the new system. The authors conclude that the VPP based new format <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> have failed on the indicators used to justify their introduction by the Kennett government. The planning system is not in crisis, but {{on the basis of the}} information gathered in this project it is approaching crisis. The introduction of the reforms promoted in Better Decisions, Faster will lead to some of the short term pressure being reduced. However, it is likely that pressure will be increased by the greater demands on metropolitan councils during the implementation of Melbourne 2030...|$|R
