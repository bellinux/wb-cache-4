40|$|After the {{intensive}} studies <b>of</b> <b>queueing</b> {{theory in the}} past decades, many excellent results in performance analysis have been obtained, and successful examples abound. However, exploring special features <b>of</b> <b>queueing</b> systems directly in performance optimization {{still seems to be}} a territory not very well cultivated. Recent progresses of perturbation analysis (PA) and sensitivity-based optimization provide a new perspective of performance optimization <b>of</b> <b>queueing</b> systems. PA utilizes the structural information <b>of</b> <b>queueing</b> systems to efficiently extract the performance sensitivity information from a sample path of system. This paper gives a brief review of PA and performance optimization <b>of</b> <b>queueing</b> systems, focusing on a fundamental concept called perturbation realization factors, which captures the special dynamic feature <b>of</b> a <b>queueing</b> system. With the perturbation realization factors as building blocks, the performance derivative formula and performance difference formula can be obtained. With performance derivatives, gradient-based optimization can be derived, while with performance difference, policy iteration and optimality equations can be derived. These two fundamental formulas provide a foundation for performance optimization <b>of</b> <b>queueing</b> systems from a sensitivity-based point of view. We hope this survey may provide some inspirations on this promising research topic. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

In [16], cluster-based back-pressure scheduling allows each node to maintain two types <b>of</b> <b>queues,</b> i.e., queues for gateways to reach destined cluster and queues for nodes within the current cluster. In this way, it largely reduces the total number <b>of</b> <b>queues</b> needed to be maintained in the network.

We apply these matching techniques at variable time-steps, updating {{the parameters of the}} fit at each step and holding them constant until the next update. We test the accuracy of this approach by comparing the moments <b>of</b> the <b>queue</b> size <b>of</b> the downstream node against the corresponding true moments <b>of</b> <b>queue</b> size: first moments <b>of</b> <b>queue</b> size are consistently accurate, while the variance <b>of</b> <b>queue</b> size is sometimes less accurate but still useful...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Queueing {{theory is}} {{generally}} {{known as the}} theory to study the performance <b>of</b> <b>queues.</b> In this paper, {{we are interested in}} another aspect <b>of</b> <b>queueing</b> theory, the theory to construct queues via switched delay lines. We consider three types of discrete-time queues: linear compressors, non-overtaking delay lines and flexible delay lines. These three types <b>of</b> <b>queues</b> correspond to certain conditional nonblocking switches and (strict sense) nonblocking switches in switching theory. Analogous to their counterparts in switching theory, there exist multistage constructions for these three types <b>of</b> <b>queues.</b> Specifically, we develop a two-stage construction of a linear compressor and a three-stage construction of a non-overtaking delay line. Similarly, there is a three-stage construction of a flexible delay line. Moreover, a flexible delay line can also be constructed by a layered Cantor network. I...|$|R
