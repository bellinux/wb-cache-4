5|$|As archbishop, William {{undertook}} {{a number of}} ecclesiastical reforms, and became popular {{with the people of}} York. However, he still needed a pallium, the sign of an archbishop's authority from the pope, which he had not yet received. The Cistercians, who were still adamantly opposed to his being archbishop, were determined to prevent his receiving it. William travelled to Rome in an attempt to obtain the pallium. The election of Pope Eugene III, a Cistercian, in 1145, was a setback for his cause. Bernard of Clairvaux, the famous Cistercian abbot and religious leader, exerted all his influence to ensure William's suspension, sending a series of complaints to the new pope that William had been intruded by secular powers into the <b>see,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was oppressing the Cistercian monasteries and that he had irregularly appointed William of St. Barbara as Dean of York. In the winter of 1145–46 Eugene re-examined the case, declared that William had not been validly consecrated, and suspended him from office. William was required to obtain an in-person refutation of the old charges by William of St. Barbara, who was now the Bishop of Durham.|$|E
5|$|The fourth episode {{begins with}} Kills {{and a man}} {{involving}} in sexual activity. By the morning, the latter wakes up while Kills is asleep, and steals her passport and revolver. Kills is surprised to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has left and gets angry after realizing that she was robbed. During the 1970s exploitation film-inspired fifth episode, a victim of Kills denounces her to a detective, revealing that she left him in a desert. In the following episode, Kills runs over the man who robbed her two episodes earlier, with her convertible, and retrieves her passport. As the seventh webisode begins, Kills argues with her new boyfriend, who slaps her. Kills meets with him a week later, telling him that she's not angry, however she hits him with a baseball bat.|$|E

5|$|Wonka announces {{a contest}} whereby {{children}} that find Golden Tickets hidden in five Wonka bars {{will be given}} a tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate, and one a chance to be presented with an unknown grand prize. Four tickets are quickly found: the greedy and gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) from Düsseldorf; the spoiled and rotten Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) from Buckinghamshire; the competitive and boastful Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) from Atlanta; and the arrogant and aggressive Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) from Denver. Charlie hopes to find a ticket but his chances are small as money is tight, and the best has to be made of his annual birthday present of one Wonka bar and a bar bought by Grandpa Joe's money, both of which yield no tickets. All hope is seemingly crushed when the last ticket is apparently claimed in Russia. Charlie, on finding some money in the street, just intends to enjoy one chocolate bar when news breaks that the Russian ticket was fake. To Charlie's surprise, he finds the bar he just bought has the real last Golden Ticket. Bystanders attempt to separate him from it, only for the shopkeeper (Oscar James) to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> keeps the ticket and gets back home with it.|$|E
25|$|Around 1807 (sources differ), {{during the}} Napoleonic wars, the French were occupying the German town of Braunschweig, where Gauss lived. Germain, {{concerned}} that he might suffer the fate of Archimedes, wrote to General Pernety, a family friend, requesting that he ensure Gauss' safety. General Pernety sent a chief of a battalion to meet with Gauss personally to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was safe. As it turned out, Gauss was fine, but he was confused by the mention of Sophie's name.|$|E
25|$|Attiya {{was born}} on 31 January 1885 (Tu Bishvat 5645 on the Jewish calendar) in Aleppo, Syria, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire. His parents, Yitzchak and Leah, had lost several {{children}} in infancy, and before his birth they traveled to the gravesite of the Prophet Ezra to pray that if the child they were expecting was a boy, they would name him Ezra and <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> dedicated himself {{to a life of}} Torah. He had one brother, Eliyahu. His father, a respected Aleppo melamed (teacher), was a direct descendant of Rabbi Shem Tov Attiya, a disciple of Rabbi Joseph Caro, author of the Shulchan Aruch.|$|E

25|$|However, Clark {{remained}} belligerent in his {{attacks on}} the Trudeau government, angrily clashing with the prime minister in Parliament. He hired experienced staffers such as Lowell Murray, Duncan Edmonds, and William Neville, who shaped his policies and ran his office efficiently. He improved his party's standing in national opinion polls. Clark worked very hard, and gradually earned the respect of most people, including his own caucus, by presenting a series of well thought out speeches and questions in Parliament. He benefited when live television came to the House of Commons in 1977, allowing viewers to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was evolving into a real rival for Trudeau.|$|E
25|$|Jesus is not {{believed}} by his family, {{and so he}} leaves them once again, meets Mary Magdalene, and goes to work helping the fishermen on the Sea of Galilee. One day out on the Sea by himself, he is visited by God and the devil. God tells Jesus of his plan for Jesus to institute Christianity, because God is annoyed at being only the God of one race, and that other gods seem {{to get all the}} glory. Jesus is initially against what he sees as a selfish plan bound to lead to great suffering of many, but is made to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> actually has no choice in the matter.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Marvell’s seventeenth-century poem The Garden is a lyric of nine stanzas {{in which}} he rejects all forms of {{activity}} {{in the world in}} favor of solitude of the retiree in a garden. It is a type of retirement poem expressing the love of retirement—an ancient Roman concept related to otium. The poem shows the high degree of pleasure of rural retirement. Some critics <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> shows otium to mean peace, quiet and leisure—a goal for retirement from politics and business. Others see a Christianized otium with Marvell showing a representation of the progress of a soul from the pursuit for the pagan promised land of the peaceful countryside and contemplation to the search for the lost heaven on earth.|$|E
50|$|Annette Watson - Annette {{is a smart}} {{friend of}} Steven's and {{sometimes}} watches Jeffy. She has an unknown crush on Steven, but <b>sees</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> likes Renee, and is sad, but not hopeless. Steven was tutored by her when he was failing his classes. She later teams up with Renee to help raise money for Jeffrey at their spring concert. Finally, Steven <b>sees</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> likes her as well because he begins {{to fall in love}} with her.|$|R

25|$|When the {{ambulance}} arrived, medics determined Landau and Rosencrantz {{were the most}} seriously wounded {{of the men and}} took to the hospital immediately. A second ambulance was called for to take Schultz and Berman. Berman was unconscious, but Schultz was drifting in and out of lucidity, as police attempted to comfort him and get information. Because the medics had no pain relievers, Schultz was given brandy to relieve his suffering. When the second ambulance arrived, Schultz gave one of the medics $10,000 in cash to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> received the best treatment. After surgery, when it looked as if Schultz would live, the medic was so worried that he would be indebted to the mobster for keeping the money that he shoved the money back in bed with Schultz.|$|E
25|$|When Stevenson {{heard the}} {{fighting}} between Walthall and Geary, he ordered Pettus to take three regiments {{from the summit}} to assist Jackson. By this time, Moore's Alabamians were moving up amidst Walthall's retreating men, and they fired on Ireland's New Yorkers from 100 yards. Unable to see {{the size of the}} force resisting it through the fog, the Union men retreated beyond a stone wall. Moore's 1,000 men took positions in the rifle pits facing the wall and waited for the inevitable counterattack. Ireland's men were too exhausted to make an immediate move. As Whitaker's brigade arrived after 1 p.m., they stepped over Ireland's men and rushed into the attack. Candy's brigade was moving up the mountain side on Whitaker's left, followed by the brigades of Woods and Grose. Moore could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was being significantly outflanked on the right and chose to fall back rather than be surrounded.|$|E
25|$|Kray's troops reached Alessandria on 12 June and Suvorov {{planned to}} launch {{them into an}} attack on Pérignon's wing early on the 14th. This proved to be impossible, but Kray managed to join Bellegarde's force and he promised to attack on 15 August. Meanwhile, the {{division}} of François Watrin moved down from the hills {{in the direction of}} Tortona, giving every indication that the French offensive was still in full swing. Joubert had hoped that he was facing only 8,000 enemies. But he was stunned to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was facing at least 36,000 enemies including Kray's corps in the plains below. Both Pérignon and Saint-Cyr counseled retreat, but Joubert put off a final decision until the next day. Meanwhile, Suvorov assumed that the French army would soon descend into the plains. When the French came forward, Kray and 27,000 soldiers would cut into their left flank while Bagration's 5,700-man Russian advance guard would turn their right flank. With luck the two forces would link hands behind the French. Once the turning movements were well developed, Wilhelm Derfelden's 9,850 Russians and Melas' 8,800 Austrians would join the battle. Farther north, Johann Baptist Alcaini's 5,260-strong force besieged Tortona, covered by Andrei Grigorevich Rosenberg's 8,270 Russians.|$|E

25|$|Dana awakens back at {{home with}} her wrists bandaged and Kevin by her side. She tells him of her eight months in the plantation, of Hagar's birth, and of the need to keep Rufus alive, as the slaves would be {{separated}} and sold if he died. When Kevin asks if Rufus has raped Dana, she responds that he has not, that a rape attempt would be the act that would cause her to kill him, despite the possible consequences. Fifteen days later, on the 4th of July, Dana returns to the plantation where she finds that Alice has hanged herself. Alice attempted to run away after Dana disappeared, and as punishment Rufus whipped her and told her that he had sold her children. In reality, he had sent to them to stay with his aunt in Baltimore. Racked with guilt about Alice’s death, Rufus nearly commits suicide. After Alice’s funeral, Dana uses that guilt to convince Rufus to free his children by Alice. From that moment on, Rufus keeps Dana at his side almost constantly, having her share meals and teach his children. One day, he finally admits that he wants Dana to replace Alice in his life. He says that unlike Alice, who, despite growing used to Rufus, never stopped plotting to escape him, Dana will <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is a fair master and eventually stop hating him. Dana, horrified at the thought of forgiving Rufus in this way, flees to the attic to find her knife. Rufus follows her there, and when he attempts to rape her, Dana stabs him twice with her knife. Nigel arrives to see Rufus's death throes, at which point Dana becomes terribly sick and time travels home for the last time, only to find herself in excruciating pain, as her arm has been joined to a wall in the spot where Rufus was holding it.|$|E

500|$|DeForest Kelley as Leonard McCoy, {{chief medical}} officer. Kelley also noted the physicality {{required}} for the film and enjoyed doing things {{that he had not}} been asked to do in years. [...] "I was very pleased to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> [...] brought it along in fine style," [...] he said. Kelley noted that his own ambition to direct had deserted him after seeing difficulties Nimoy faced directing the previous two Star Trek films.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Kinberg {{said of the}} {{wobbling}} chess {{piece at}} the end of the film, [...] "There is a scene before the credits where Magneto's playing chess, and you <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can just make the chess piece move, so there's a hint that he's starting to regain his powers. The leap from there was that cure from The Last Stand didn't work exactly the way they thought it would, and so we just leaped forward however many years, and he's got his powers back." ...|$|E
