40|$|The Apennine Peninsula {{is one of}} Europe's main glacial refugial {{areas and}} harbors {{a large number of}} {{lineages}} and species. Here, a pattern of higher genetic diversity in the south compared to that of the north is characteristic of most vertebrates; however, most studies that have produced these results have relied only on inferences based on mitochondrial DNA. The <b>spectacled</b> <b>salamanders</b> (genus Salamandrina) are endemic to the Apennine Peninsula and have diverged into two sibling species: S. terdigitata (in the south) and S. perspicillata (in the north), presumably in the late Miocene or early Pliocene. By sequencing one mitochondrial (cytb) and two nuclear genes (RAG 1 and POMC) and genotyping 10 microsatellite loci, we traced the evolution of these sibling species from their divergence to their contemporary population structure at a fine scale. Using a multilocus coalescent-based approach, we estimated the temporal divergence of both species at approximately 2. 25 mya (million years ago), which, hence, is much younger than previous estimates. The classical pattern of high genetic diversity in the south and lower diversity in the north was confirmed only for some markers, and the demographic histories of the two species differed substantially. Whereas S. perspicillata (north) expanded from a single major refugium {{in the center of the}} Apennine Peninsula, populations of S. terdigitata (south) persisted through cooler periods in multiple refugia. Further, the fine-scale population genetic structure of 16 S. perspicillata populations revealed significant genetic differentiation, even across short geographic distances. The results of our study stress that for a better understanding of phylogeographic patterns and past demographic processes, both mitochondria] and multiple nuclear loci should be analyzed to avoid gene-specific, and possibly biased results.

50|$|The <b>spectacled</b> <b>salamander</b> is {{most often}} found near streams, in dense vegetation, under leaf litter, dead wood, or stones. It is nocturnal and terrestrial. When threatened, it raises its tail and legs (unkenreflex), {{displaying}} its red underside as a deterrent. Similar warning displays (aposematism) are shown by newts, the Apennine yellow-bellied toad and the spotted salamander. Mating takes place on land in spring. Clutches contain about 30-50 eggs and the larvae take 2-3 mo to develop. The <b>spectacled</b> <b>salamander</b> female enters water only to lay eggs, while the male, once metamorphosis has taken place, avoids water altogether.|$|E

40|$|Salamandrina is a {{monotypic}} genus of {{the family}} Salamandridae endemic to Italy. Forty five individuals of the <b>spectacled</b> <b>salamander,</b> Salamandrina terdigitata, representing 11 populations throughout the whole distribution range were examined for sequence variation of three mitochondrial DNA genes encoding the 12 S and 16 S ribosomal RNA's and cytochrome b 1324 bp). The results indicate the existence of two genetically distinct and geographically non- overlapping mtDNA lineages. The first lineage includes the southern populations and the second one comprises the central- northern populations. The degree of genetic divergence {{between the two groups}} is high and comparable to distances calculated from homologous sequences available in GenBank between other Salamandrid species. As a result, the genus Salamandrina probably requires splitting into two species. We also compare substitution rates associated with the mitochondrial genes employed across all Salamandrids studied so far, and discuss two possible palaeogeographic scenarios which could have shaped the splitting of the two Salamandrina lineages. These findings have also important implications for management and conservations of the <b>spectacled</b> <b>salamander,</b> which is protected under several international and regional conventions and directives...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of the Northern <b>Spectacled</b> <b>Salamander</b> in the Colli Albani (= Albani Hills), together with some ecological aspects at eight sites are reported. In four sites, oviposition took place between February and April, but in the other four it probably started {{at least in the}} first half of december. Eggs were deposited into the water of either temporary or perennial spring ponds or inside flooded man-made tuff tunnels. In some sites, which do not undergo summer drought, some larvae surpassed the summer and even the following winter. For one site, length and weight of 52 ovipositing females were recorded and larval development was monitored. A clear relation between larval body size and limb development did not appear...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{reproductive}} biology of the <b>spectacled</b> <b>salamander,</b> Salamandrina terdigidata, in Central Italy by daily sampling over three breeding seasons. Reproduction takes place annually, between February and May. Clutch size varies (1 - 65), {{and are usually}} placed by females {{on the underside of}} stones. The total number of eggs deposited varies yearly and is positively related to the period of preceding rainfall. Large females start breeding earlier and show stronger oviposition site fidelity than small ones. For oviposition females choose the portions of the stream that have the highest density of stones. The speed at which embryos develop increased over time, presumably under the influence of rising water temperature. Hatching success is negatively affected by aquatic drift, desiccation, predation by Trichoptera larvae and the absence of hiding sites...|$|E
40|$|Chemical cues {{are used}} as {{ubiquitous}} markers of individual, group, kinship, and species identity. Northern <b>Spectacled</b> <b>Salamander</b> (Salamandrina perspicillata) is a semi-terrestrial and elusive species. Females {{can be found in}} water bodies just in the spawning season but spend most of their life, as well as males do, in terrestrial shelters such as cracks, crevices and under stones to reduce the risks of dehydration. We have investigated whether, in reproductive females, animal’s own and conspecific chemical cues playa role in the shelter choice. We performed unforced “two-choice system” tests in order to study the behavioural response of salamanders to scent marks. For each test, the choice between two artificial shelters (plastic tubes) was offered to each focal individual. Data were analyzed using the binomial distribution. Our results show that Salamandrina use the sense of smell in the terrestrial shelter choice as animals (i) were capable to discriminate between a tube previously used by itself and a unused one (P 0. 05). We suggest thatattraction towards conspecific smells could favour a gregarious behaviour in winter refuge...|$|E
40|$|Trophic niche may be {{the most}} {{important}} ecological dimension for some vertebrate groups and in particular for terrestrial amphibians, that are important predators of soil invertebrates. In general, resource partitioning occurs between syntopic species with similar ecological niches, and coexistence patterns seem to be regulated by temporal resource variability. However most of the generalization on foraging strategies of terrestrial salamanders are extrapolated from studies on New World temperate species, thus we investigated the seasonal effect of resource variation in an European forest ecosystem, in which two ecologically similar but phylogenetically distinct salamander species are found. The diet of adult and juvenile cave salamanders (Speleomantes strinati), and of adult <b>spectacled</b> <b>salamander</b> (Salamandrina perspicillata) was obtained by stomach flushing, and results showed large seasonal changes both in prey availability and in salamander realised trophic niche. Values of trophic diversity were similar and niche overlaps were large among all salamander groups in spring, during high prey availability. Conversely in autumn, when a two-fold reduction in prey biomass was observed, there was a clear niche partitioning as the smaller S. perspicillata shifted from a generalist to a specialized trophic strategy. Juvenile Speleomantes strinatii, that largely overlapped in size with S. perspicillata, did not show any change in diet, suggesting that the feeding strategies were species-specific and not size-mediated. The observed patterns of variation in feeding ecology indicate that similar predators may react differently to changing prey availability to enhance niche partitioning. We also observed an increased energy intake during autumn for S perspicillata and S. strinatii juveniles, possibly related to differences in microhabitat use and activity patterns...|$|E
