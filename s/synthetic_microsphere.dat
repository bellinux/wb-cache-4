Neonatal cytotoxic T cell responses {{have only been}} elicited to date with immunogens or delivery systems inducing potent direct APC activation. To define the minimal activation requirements for the induction of neonatal CD 8 (+) cytotoxic responses, we used <b>synthetic</b> <b>microspheres</b> (MS) coated with a single CD 8 (+) T cell peptide from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or HIV- 1. Unexpectedly, a single injection of peptide-conjugated MS without added adjuvant induced CD 4 -dependent Ag-specific neonatal murine cytotoxic responses with adult-like CTL precursor frequency, avidity for Ag, and frequency of IFN-gamma-secreting CD 8 (+) splenocytes. Neonatal CD 8 (+) T cell responses to MS-LCMV were elicited within 2 wk of a single immunization and, upon challenge, provided similar protection from viral replication as adult CTLs, demonstrating their in vivo competence.

40|$|Fluorescence {{detection}} and imaging are vital technologies {{in the life}} sciences and clinical diagnostics. The key to obtaining high-resolution images and sensitive detection is to use fluorescent molecules or particles that absorb and emit visible light with high efficiency. We have synthesized supramolecular complexes consisting of a branched DNA template and fluorogenic intercalating dyes. Because dyes can intercalate up to every other base pair, high densities of fluorophores are assembled yet the DNA template keeps them {{far enough away from}} each other to prevent self-quenching. The efficiency with which these noncovalent assemblies absorb light is more than 10 -fold greater than that of the individual dye molecules. Förster resonance energy transfer from the intercalated dyes to covalently attached acceptor dyes is very efficient, allowing for wavelength shifting of the emission spectrum. Simple biotinylation of the DNA template allows for labeling of streptavidin-coated <b>synthetic</b> <b>microspheres</b> and mouse T-cells...|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal {{infection}} due to {{biological contamination}} {{of drinking water}} supplies is a major health issue worldwide. Naturally occurring and inexpensive modified materials such as surfactant-modified zeolites (SMZ) have net positive surface charge, which may prove useful for adsorption of pathogens such as Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinales (lamblia). SMZ is engineered by modifying the concentration of surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) {{on the surface of}} zeolite media. Two different SMZ formulations (cationic SMZ and hydrophobic SMZ) were engineered to develop the most effective media for pathogen removal from drinking water. In the laboratory, batch experiments of SMZ, raw zeolite, and sand were conducted to determine pathogen sorption to the media. Then, vertical columns packed with SMZ or zeolite material were used to evaluate pathogen transport. Tritium tracer tests were used to determine hydraulic properties of the materials. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>microspheres</b> were used as surrogates for the pathogens, which simulated the size and charge characteristics of Cryptosporidium and Giardia.

40|$|Grazing {{rates of}} {{zooplankton}} were analysed {{in the summer}} of 1999 in Yellow Belly Lake, an oligotrophic system in the SawtoothMountains of Idaho (U. S. A.). The colonial rotifer Conochilus unicornis was a dominant species in the epilimnion, with densities reaching 20 colonies l− 1 (ca. 400 ind. l− 1). Clearance rates were measured with an in situ Haney Grazing chamber and <b>synthetic</b> <b>microspheres</b> 5, 9 and 23 μm in diameter. At epilimnetic temperatures of around 14 ◦C, mean clearance rates for 5 μm particles ranged from 30 to 65 μl ind. − 1 h − 1. Clearance rates were 2 – 9 times higher on the 5 μm spheres than on the 9 μm spheres, and C. unicornis almost never fed on the 23 μm spheres. Grazing rates did not change over the diel cycle. Clearance rates declined more than 10 -fold as temperatures declined from 14 ◦C in the epilimnion to 7 ◦C in the metalimnion. In the epilimnion, grazing by C. unicornis was more important than grazing by crustaceans in the community, at least on particles ≤ 9 μm. The results show the importance of grazing by rotifers in lakes, and the significance of spatial variations that influence grazing rates...|$|R

Alginate has also been fabricated into microspheres or microbeads utilising coagulation (Martinsen et al. 1989) and emulsification (Lemoine et al. 1998; Mofidi et al. 2000; Wan et al. 1992) processes. Commonly, microspheres have been formed by coagulating the alginate solution in the form of fine droplets using calcium chloride solution (Martinsen et al. 1989). However, a limiting factor highlighted for the coagulation method was its unsuitability for large-scale production. Mofidi et al. (2000) investigated the mass production of alginate microspheres using water-in-oil emulsion techniques (similar to production of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>microspheres</b> highlighted above). They stirred the alginate solution within a non-aqueous (oily phase) media in the presence of calcium chloride coagulant to form the microspheres. Non-aggregated alginate microspheres with an average diameter of 8  µm have been produced via an emulsification process (see Fig.  15 b) by Lemoine et al. (1998). A high encapsulation efficiency (> 90  %) and high loading (10  % w/w) of bovine serum albumin (BSA) within the alginate microspheres was achieved. They also reported the in vitro release profile of BSA which suggested a faster release rate of encapsulated BSA in PBS media. In addition, they also suggested that decrease of the release rate could be achieved by coating the alginate microspheres with poly(l-lysine).|$|R

As previously reported, peptide-coated MS elicited no detectable activation of adult CD 11 c(+) dendritic cells (DC). In contrast, CTL responses were associated with a partial activation of neonatal CD 11 c(+) DC, reflected by the up-regulation of CD 80 and CD 86 expression but no concurrent changes in MHC class II or CD 40 expression. However, this partial activation of neonatal DC was not sufficient to circumvent the requirement for CD 4 (+) T cell help. The effective induction of neonatal CD 8 (+) T cell responses by this minimal Ag delivery system demonstrates that neonatal CD 11 c(+) DC may mature sufficiently to stimulate naive CD 8 (+) neonatal T cells, {{even in the absence}} of strong maturation signals...|$|R

40|$|Tarsal {{adhesive}} pads are {{crucial for the}} ability of insects to traverse their natural environment. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} for both hairy and smooth {{adhesive pads}}, significant reduction in adhesion can occur because of contamination of these pads by wax crystals present on plant surfaces or <b>synthetic</b> <b>microspheres.</b> In this paper, we focus on the smooth adhesive pads of ants and study systematically how particulate contamination and the subsequent loss of adhesion depends on particle size, particle surface energy, humidity and species size. To this end, workers of ant species Polyrhachis dives and Myrmica scabrinodis (Hymenoptera; Formicidae) were presented with loose synthetic powder barriers with a range of powder diameters (1 - 500 μm) and surface energies (PTFE or glass), which they would have to cross in order to escape the experimental arena. The barrier experiments were conducted for a range of humidities (10 - 70 %). Experimental results and scanning electron microscopy confirm that particulate powders adversely affect the adhesive ability of both species of ant on smooth substrates via contamination of the arolia. Specifically, the loss of adhesion was found to depend strongly on particle diameter, but only weakly on particle type, with the greatest loss occurring for particle diameters smaller than the claw dimensions of each species, and no effect of humidity was found. We also observed that ants were repelled by the powder barriers which led to a decrease of adhesion prior to their eventual crossing, suggesting that insect antennae {{may play a role in}} probing the mechanical fragility of substrates before crossing them. © 2012.

Recent advances in molecular biology, immunology, and pathology of mucosal infections give us tools to develop effective oral vaccines. Oral vaccines encapsulated in either biodegradable <b>microspheres,</b> <b>synthetic</b> adhesive liposomes, or nonvirulent live vectors hold promise as a practical approach for immunocontraception of free-roaming wildlife.

40|$|Insulin-like {{growth factor}} binding {{proteins}} (IGFBPs) are prime regulators of IGF-action in numerous cell types including the {{retinal pigment epithelium}} (RPE). The RPE performs several functions essential for vision, including growth factor secretion and waste removal via a phagocytic process mediated in part by vitronectin (Vn). In the course of studying the effects of IGFBPs on IGF-mediated VEGF secretion and Vn-mediated phagocytosis in the RPE cell line ARPE- 19, we have discovered that these cells avidly ingest <b>synthetic</b> <b>microspheres</b> (2. 0 μm diameter) coated with IGFBPs. Given the novelty of this finding and the established role for endocytosis in mediating IGFBP actions in other cell types, we have explored the potential role of candidate cell surface receptors. Moreover, we have examined the role of key IGFBP structural motifs, by comparing responses to {{three members of the}} IGFBP family (IGFBP- 3, IGFBP- 4 and IGFBP- 5) which display overlapping variations in primary structure and glycosylation status. Coating of microspheres (FluoSpheres®, sulfate modified polystyrene filled with a fluorophore) was conducted at 37 °C for 1 h using 20 μg/mL of test protein, followed by extensive washing. Binding of proteins was confirmed using a microBCA assay. The negative control consisted of microspheres treated with 0. 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA), and all test samples were post-treated with BSA in an effort to coat any remaining free protein binding sites, which might otherwise encourage non-specific interactions with the cell surface. Serum-starved cultures of ARPE- 19 cells were incubated with microspheres for 24 h, using a ratio of approximately 100 microspheres per cell. Uptake of microspheres was quantified using a fluorometer and was confirmed visually by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The ARPE- 19 cells displayed little affinity for BSA-treated microspheres, but avidly ingested large quantities of those pre-treated with Vn (ANOVA; p < 0. 001). Strong responses were also observed towards recombinant formulations of non-glycosylated IGFBP- 3, glycosylated IGFBP- 3 and glycosylated IGFBP- 5 (all p < 0. 001), while glycosylated IGFBP- 4 induced a relatively minor response (p < 0. 05). The response to IGFBP- 3 was unaffected in the presence of excess soluble IGFBP- 3, IGF-I or Vn. Likewise, soluble IGFBP- 3 did not induce uptake of BSA-treated microspheres. Antibodies to either the transferrin receptor or type 1 IGF-receptor displayed slight inhibitory effects on responses to IGFBPs and Vn. Heparin abolished responses to Vn, IGFBP- 5 and non-glycosylated IGFBP- 3, but only partially inhibited the response to glycosylated IGFBP- 3. Our results demonstrate for the first time IGFBP-mediated endocytosis in ARPE- 19 cells and suggest roles for the IGFBP-heparin-binding domain and glycosylation status. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of IGFBP actions on the RPE, and in particular suggest a role for IGFBP-endocytosis...|$|R
50|$|Wound repair {{results from}} a complex and highly orchestrated {{cellular}} and biochemical response to tissue injury. Given that the wound repair constitutes {{a major issue in}} clinical practice with enormous healthcare costs, NFB is developing several scaffold-based platforms to induce wound healing and to restore function. For example, in cases of chronic healing (e.g. diabetic patients), a fibrin-based scaffold has been used to target a vector encoding eNOS to the wound site. This enhances transfection efficiency of the vector resulting in greater eNOS expression, greater production of NO and better healing in an impaired wound model. Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) is a particularly severe genetic condition which leads to extensive blistering, repeated wounding and poor healing ability. RDEB is caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene which results in the reduction or loss of type VII collagen in the skin. One of the projects at NFB aims to deliver the COL7A1 gene encapsulated with a thermal responsive and crosslinkingable hydrogel scaffold to EB cells on the wounds through a non-viral gene-delivery system. NFB is also using natural and <b>synthetic</b> hollow <b>microspheres</b> to encapsulate anti-fibrotic drugs and incorporate them into implantable devices in order to inhibit fibrotic capsule formation. Another strategy developed by NFB in the area of soft tissue augmentation with the use of cholecyst-derived extracellular matrix (CEM). NFB studies have shown it to be very effective in the augmentation of body wall defects primarily because of its strength and inherent biological properties. Optimal stabilisation and functionalisation offers control over degradation that can match the rate of the healing process.|$|R

One attractive possibility consists of targeting the antigen to phagocytic or macropinocytic antigen-presenting cells. In this study, we demonstrate that strong CD 8 + class I-restricted cytotoxic responses are induced upon intraperitoneal immunization of mice with different peptides, characterized as CD 8 + T-cell epitopes, bound to 1 -μm <b>synthetic</b> latex <b>microspheres</b> and injected {{in the absence of}} adjuvant. The cytotoxic response induced against a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) peptide linked to these microspheres was compared to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response obtained upon immunization with the nonreplicative porcine parvovirus-like particles (PPV:VLP) carrying the same peptide (PPV:VLP-LCMV) previously described (C. Sedlik, M. F. Saron, J. Sarraseca, I. Casal, and C. Leclerc, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 : 7503 – 7508, 1997). We show that the induction of specific CTL activity by peptides bound to microspheres requires CD 4 + T-cell help in contrast to the CTL response obtained with the peptide delivered by viral pseudoparticles. Furthermore, PPV:VLP are 100 -fold more efficient than microspheres in generating a strong CTL response characterized by a high frequency of specific T cells of high avidity. Moreover, PPV:VLP-LCMV are able to protect mice against a lethal LCMV challenge whereas microspheres carrying the LCMV epitope fail to confer such protection. This study demonstrates the crucial involvement of the frequency and avidity of CTLs in conferring antiviral protective immunity and highlights the importance of considering these parameters when developing new vaccine strategies...|$|R

40|$|Many {{gastro-intestinal}} {{infections are}} still endemic in {{large parts of}} the world causing morbidity and mortality among humans and animals. Mucosal surfaces are the major entrance for infectious pathogens and the induction of local adaptive immune responses are required to combat intestinal pathogens. Furthermore, the gastrointestinal system performs a balancing act in making the decision between immunity and oral tolerance, as a discrimination between harmful and beneficial antigens. Without doubt, the development of vaccines constitutes one of the major breakthroughs of human medicine, allowing us to control and prevent numerous infectious diseases in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Especially in developing countries, oral vaccination provides different social and economic advantages (needle-free, non-invasive administration route, patient compliance, less risk of contamination,…). Current oral vaccines, based on killed or attenuated pathogens, provoke an inefficient immune response or maintain the risk of reversion to virulence and the induction of disease in immunocompromised individuals. Subunit vaccines are a safe alternative, however are less efficacious and require adjuvants. A promising strategy for vaccination with safe, biodegradable non-replicating antigen delivery systems has gained increased interest for eliciting cellular and humoral immune responses. However, the low gastric pH and degradation by proteolytic enzymes present in the gastrointestinal tract, are huge obstacles that inhibit the ability to successfully develop new mucosal vaccines. Microparticulate encapsulation strategies can protect the antigen from degradation, increase the concentration of antigen in the vicinity of mucosal tissue for better absorption and selectively target immune inductive sites, namely the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), Peyer’s patches (PP) and intestinal antigen presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells (DCs). Microbial (bacterial toxins, CpG DNA) and <b>synthetic</b> (<b>microspheres,</b> liposomes, PLGA,…) strategies have been investigated. Contemporary developments in the use of delivery systems and adjuvants have an undeniable value in the oral vaccine development, but {{a better understanding of the}} unique properties of mucosal surfaces and the vaccination strategies are indispensable. A first part of this thesis describes an introduction on the intestinal immune system expanding on antigen sampling, presentation and epithelial crosstalk in the small intestine. Furthermore, we summarize current registered human oral vaccines and highlight the importance of animal models in the contribution to the translational research into humans. Lastly, we address the rationale and key biological and physicochemical aspects of oral vaccine design and emphasize the use of yeast-derived β-glucan microparticles as an oral vaccine delivery platform. In a second part of this thesis, we performed a layer-by-layer synthesis of hollow yeast shells through electrostatic interactions using ovalbumin (OVA) as model antigen. Zeta-potential measurements and the quantification of antigen loading gave more information about the OVA-yeast shell interaction and its encapsulation efficiency. Additionally, the kinetics of antigen release and processing is investigated via OVA-DQ-loaded yeast particles in pronase solutions and in in vitro cultured murine BMDCs. In a third part of this thesis, we investigated the particle characteristics of β-glucan microparticles and evaluated their potential as an oral antigen delivery vehicle in human intestinal epithelial cell lines and murine models. A first finding is that β-glucan microparticles are of an ideal size of natural fungal pathogens to be recognized and highly efficient internalized by human Caco- 2 and HT- 29 cells. Internalization of β-glucan microparticles increased with incubation time and was dose-dependent. Secondly, β-glucan microparticles are capable of reaching the murine Peyer’s patches (specialized lymphoid tissue of the small intestine) via the M cell-mediated transcellular pathway and promoted MHCII–mediated presentation of the model antigen ovalbumin. Additionally, β-glucan microparticles induced intestinal secretory-IgA (S-IgA) and secretory component (SC) antibodies and a mixed Th 1 /Th 17 cellular-mediated immune response against the model antigen ovalbumin. The final part of this thesis, focuses on porous antigen-loaded polyelectrolyte microparticles obtained by the spray-drying technique, namely calcium carbonate- and mannitol-based microspheres. The spray-drying method not only enhances the stability and controls the particle size ranges of the dry formulation, it also avoids the cold-chain-constrained settings, which is a very important aspect for vaccination campaigns in third world countries. Stability tests of CP and MP revealed negligible or no antigen loss in gastric and intestinal conditions. Both particle types are successfully internalized by intestinal epithelial cells and subsequently induced MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules...|$|R
40|$|White {{wines are}} liable to develop haze during storage and {{transport}} due to residual protein in the finished wine. Since haze in white wines is considered unacceptable, winemakers attempt to reduce the protein content prior to bottling {{through the use of}} fining agents such as bentonite. The use of bentonite is not without economic cost with the estimated annual impact to the New Zealand wine industry in the region of NZD 35 million. The optimum quantity of bentonite to be used is normally determined using a heat test in conjunction with empirical fining trials. During these tests the winemaker is required to conduct various haze comparisons. Since these assessments are difficult to perform visually, researchers recommend the use of suitable nephelometric instrumentation to ensure consistency and precision. Despite these recommendations, most winemakers have not purchased the necessary equipment; it is thought that cost is the primary deterrent. The overall goal of this project was to explore the relationships between nephelometry, digital imaging and human perception of haze in terms of thresholds and intensity. In addition, the feasibility of using digital imaging devices to make nephelometric measurements was to be investigated. A range of achromatic and yellow turbid suspensions were prepared by suspending <b>synthetic</b> polymer <b>microspheres</b> of diameter 0. 25 μm in aqueous solutions. Base wine stocks exhibiting high turbidity were prepared by heating commercial grade Chardonnay wine at 90 ˚ for two hours. A range of wine samples of varying turbidities were then prepared by dilution with untreated wine. Polymer microsphere suspensions and wine samples of varying visual haze were used in a series of sensory and instrumentation experiments. The sensory experiments examined haze detection thresholds and intensity scaling in human subjects. All evaluations took place in purpose designed sensory booths utilising overhead light emitting diode (LED) illumination. The booth backgrounds and sides were modified to present dark or light surrounds by hanging black or white linen on the walls. Samples were presented to human subjects in standard ISO tasting glasses and the subjects were permitted to manipulate the glass freely whilst they evaluated the samples. Turbidity measurements were made with a Hach 2100 P nephelometric device. Image data was captured using a modified Canon A 2300 digital still camera using 90 ˚ viewing geometries. Haze threshold determinations were made for achromatic and yellow microsphere suspensions using the Ascending Method of Limits (AML) and 3 -Alternate Forced Choice (3 AFC) methods. The lowest thresholds were found when achromatic suspensions were presented in a dark surround where individual thresholds ranged from 0. 21 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) to 1. 07 NTU. The highest thresholds were found when yellow suspensions were presented in a light surround where individual thresholds ranged from 1. 89 NTU to 25. 16 NTU. Heat treated Chardonnay wine samples were also evaluated in a dark surround where individual thresholds ranged from 0. 52 NTU to 1. 39 NTU. Visual haze intensities in achromatic and yellow microsphere suspensions were assessed by human subjects in dark and light surrounds using modulus Magnitude Estimation (ME). Sample luminance was determined by digitally photographing the samples under the same conditions employed for the ME evaluations. The perceived haze intensity with respect to luminance was found to follow generalised power or logarithmic functions similar to psycho-physical models commonly proposed for the response of the human visual system to brightness and lightness. The data exhibited a bi-segment nature indicative of surround and/or planar contrast induction. Similar responses were found for heat treated Chardonnay wine samples using turbidity as the independent variable. Turbidity values were measured for a range achromatic and yellow microsphere suspension samples. Luminance values were derived from digital images taken of ISO tasting glasses containing the same microsphere suspensions. The turbidity and luminance values were found to be linearly related below 50 NTU (dark surround, R 2 = 0. 9978; light surround, R 2 = 0. 9813). A subsequent experiment examined turbidity values and luminance data in achromatic and yellow microsphere suspension samples over a low range (< 6 NTU) by imaging the sample surface directly rather than through the glass receptacle. Turbidity vales and luminance data were again found to be linearly related (R 2 = 0. 9628). Measurements from the Hach 2100 P device and a luminance based measurement model were found to be mean and median equivalent for the low range experimental data...|$|R
