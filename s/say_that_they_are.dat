5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going to the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{proponents of}} {{creation}} science often <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> concerned with religious and moral questions {{as well as}} natural observations and predictive hypotheses. Many state that their opposition to scientific evolution is primarily based on religion.|$|E
25|$|It is {{sometimes}} said that fractals are scale-invariant, although more precisely, one should <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> self-similar. A fractal {{is equal to}} itself typically for only a discrete set of values , and even then a translation and rotation {{may have to be}} applied to match the fractal up to itself.|$|E

[...] "We are so glad to see you again," [...] said Mrs. O'Hara.|$|R

25|$|Other magazines, such as Granta, Tin House, and Boston Review {{have responded}} to The Count by making a {{conscious}} effort to remedy the gender disparity within their journals. Not only do the editors of these publications <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> making these efforts, but the numbers of The Count show this to be the case.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} stanza, the poet visits a fruit shop. There she {{inquires}} {{about what they}} are selling. They reply, we sell lemon, pomegranate and plum. Then the musicians were asked what they play and they say sitar, sarangi and drums. The poet even comes across magicians and asks them what they are chanting and they <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> chanting magical spells to charm thousand ages to come.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that people {{were less likely to}} use formulaic {{language}} in general topics and domains they were more well-versed in, because they were more adept at selecting the appropriate terms. To date, there is insufficient research done to say if fillers are a part of integral meaning, or if they are aspect of performance, but we can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> useful in facilitating information for the listener.|$|E

25|$|To this remark, the Buddha {{tells them}} that the Brahmins have indeed {{forgotten}} about their past if they said such things. The {{fact is that the}} women in the Brahmin caste can get pregnant, give birth, and take care of their children. But the Brahmins still <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> born from the Mouth of the God Brahma and other (castes) are born from Brahma's feet. Thus, the Brahmin's words are untrue. The Buddha said that the Brahmins are not speaking truthfully and they will reap a bad result from their own deeds.|$|E
25|$|Luisa {{is often}} {{troubled by the}} antics of her grandchildren and when she sees her {{youngest}} granddaughter, Nicky (Carly Hillman), kissing Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou), the shock is too much and she suffers a stroke shortly before Bruno's birthday in July 1998. She recovers but remains frail and in December Bruno and Luisa decide to take a trip to Italy to discover their homeland together, {{before it is too}} late. When they get there they like it so much that they decide to stay. A few weeks later they telephone Rosa to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not returning.|$|E
25|$|Someone {{wanting to}} claim ESA {{will need a}} medical certificate, i.e. a sick-note, signed by their GP to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not fully fit for work. The new {{claimant}} must then contact the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), usually by phone, who will log their claim and usually post them a questionnaire to complete (except in rare circumstances where a full assessment isn't required, such as when a doctor has officially certified the claimant as being likely to die within six months). The completed form must then be sent in the envelope provided to the Health Assessment Advisory Service - the trading name of the assessment provider, Maximus.|$|E

25|$|The European Union {{promotes}} various initiatives regarding {{work-life balance}} and encourages its {{member states to}} implement family-friendly policies. In Europe, the Working Time Directive has implemented a maximum 48-hour working week. Many countries have opted for fewer hours. France introduced a 35-hour workweek. Contradictory to the Scandinavian countries, {{there is no evidence}} of state policies that absolutely encourage men to take on a larger share of domestic work in France, Portugal, or Britain. In a 2007, the European Quality of Life Survey found that countries in south-eastern Europe had the most common problems with work–life balance. In Croatia and Greece, a little over 70% of working citizens <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> too tired to do household jobs at least several times a month because of work.|$|E
25|$|Three {{years have}} passed, and George and Emily prepare to wed. The day {{is filled with}} stress. Howie Newsome is {{delivering}} milk in the pouring rain while Si Crowell, younger brother of Joe, laments how George's baseball talents will be squandered. George pays an awkward visit to his soon-to-be in-laws. Here, the Stage Manager interrupts the scene and takes the audience back a year, {{to the end of}} Emily and George's junior year. Emily confronts George about his pride, and over an ice cream soda, they discuss the future and their love for each other. George resolves not to go to college, as he had planned, but to work and eventually take over his uncle's farm. In the present, George and Emily <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not ready to marry—George to his mother, Emily to her father—but they both calm down and happily go through with the wedding.|$|E
25|$|Although the Talmud {{states that}} women are obligated to say birkat hamazon and that accordingly, three women can {{constitute}} a zimmun and lead it (Berachot 45b), later authorities, such as Maimonides and the Mishnah Berurah, held that women were exempt from leading a zimmun on grounds that women were not generally sufficiently educated to know how. A number of Modern Orthodox authorities have held that because of improvements in women's religious education women can now do so, and some <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> now obligated to. Accordingly, women forming a zimmun and leading birkat hamazon has become increasingly common in Modern Orthodox circles. Such authorities disagree, however, on the appropriateness of women leading a zimmun {{in the presence of}} men (or of three men). A minority of Modern Orthodox authorities, citing earlier authorities including Meiri, Sefer HaMeorot and the Shiltei HaGibborim, also hold that 10 women can (or should) constitute a minyan for purposes of saying Zimmun B'Shem for birkat hamazon. Unlike in Conservative or Reform Judaism, even Orthodox authorities who hold that women can form a zimmun maintain that one cannot be formed from a combination of men and women.|$|E

In Tommy Smith's view, Shankly was completely in tune with the city of Liverpool; he loved the supporters and they loved him, mainly [...] "because they knew he understood them".|$|E
500|$|Boltzmann {{states that}} this [...] "sensitive region" [...] will {{lie on the}} surface of the atom, or may {{partially}} lie inside the atom, and will firmly be connected to it. [...] Specifically, he states “only when two atoms are situated so that their sensitive regions are in contact, or partly overlap, will there be a chemical attraction between them. [...] We then <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> chemically bound to each other.” [...] This picture is detailed below, showing the α-sensitive region of atom-A overlapping with the β-sensitive region of atom-B: ...|$|E
500|$|Wagner's operas do {{not reveal}} where the Rhinemaidens came from, {{or whether they}} have any {{connection}} to other characters. Whereas most {{of the characters in}} the cycle are inter-related, through birth, marriage, or sometimes both, the Rhinemaidens are seemingly independent. The identity of their father who entrusted them with the guardianship of the gold is not given in the text. Some Wagnerean scholars have suggested that he may be a [...] "Supreme Being" [...] who is the father of Wotan and all the gods—indeed, of all creation. Others take the German Rheintöchter literally and <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the daughters of the Rhine River. Whatever is surmised, the Rhinemaidens are in a different category from Wotan and the other gods, who are destroyed by fire at the end of Götterdämmerung, while the Rhinemaidens swim happily away in the river, bearing their recovered treasure.|$|E
