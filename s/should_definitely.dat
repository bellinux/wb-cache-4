I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that <b>should</b> <b>definitely</b> count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared to work hard, and has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his head down and his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.|$|E

Josh Wolk of Entertainment Weekly gave volume one a B, saying that [...] "Family Guy Volume One: Seasons 1 & 2 rips through edgy gags, TV references, and fantasy sequences (some of which are hilariously inspired), but Fox's other buffoonish family has none of The Simpsons heart.

Loeb, the previous season's champion, set off first, followed by Grönholm, then Mikko Hirvonen. Loeb and Grönholm were the favourites to win; Loeb had won the Monte Carlo three times in a row between 2003 and 2005, and Grönholm had won in 2006. Nevertheless, there were worries that Loeb would not be physically fit enough to win. Four months earlier he had broken his left shoulder in a mountain-biking accident, and there was a chance he might not even compete {{in the first part of}} the season. His physiotherapists and consultants told him that because of the operations he had had on his arm, he <b>should</b> <b>definitely</b> have sat out the Monte Carlo Rally.

Kilkelly felt positive about the casting, saying: [...] "Dyer has a strong screen presence {{which is going to be}} crucial when it comes to taking over such an important role in EastEnders. Recent new characters to join the show have seemed to stay on the sidelines with no clear direction, while the plan for Mick is for him to join the Square and take on his new job straight away. Dyer <b>should</b> <b>definitely</b> be up to the task of hitting the ground running." [...] He was relieved that Dyer would not be playing another hardman character, saying that [...] "it should be interesting to see how he rises to the challenge." [...] However, he opined that casting a well-known actor who divides opinions could be a risk, as fans of the show may see Dyer, rather than his character, moving into the show, and hoped that the actor's profile would not lead to him leaving the series after only a short stint. Alex Fletcher from the site said, [...] "Danny Dyer. In EastEnders.

2500|$|After {{the hearing}} opened, {{government}} counsel David Pannick stated {{in response to}} a question from Justice Johnson Lam that the government had no intention of seeking an interpretation before Lam had issued his decision, but reserved the possibility of doing so afterwards. In late September, the DAB renewed calls for the Hong Kong government to consider seeking an interpretation. There were further calls for an interpretation after the government's loss in the CFI. The New People's Party, headed by former Security for Secretary Regina Ip, also joined the calls for the government to seek interpretation. By 4 October, Ip and her two deputy party heads Michael Tien and Louis Shih had organised the gathering of 3,227 signatures in support of interpretation, which they presented to Ambrose Lee at a meeting with him; however, Lee stated that the government had no intention of seeking an interpretation in the short term. Basic Law Committee member Lau Nai-keung also wrote an editorial in the China Daily stating that the government should have made an application for interpretation prior to the ruling, and <b>should</b> <b>definitely</b> make one before the case goes to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA). However, after Lam declined to issue a stay of execution of his earlier judgment in late October, Alan Leong spoke out again against calls for a NPCSC interpretation, stating that Lam's ruling showed that the courts had recognised the Immigration Department's rights as [...] "gatekeepers" [...] and that there was no need for an interpretation.|$|E

30|$|Spindle cell lesions of {{the breast}} are rare entities; however, the {{differential}} diagnosis is challenging for certain reasons (Länger et al. 2014).

In addition, clinical, radiological, and immunohistochemical similarities can be seen in these lesions. Varma and Shin (2013) suggested an algorithmic approach for the differential diagnosis, and stated that the following parameters <b>should</b> be <b>definitely</b> evaluated: (1) cellular structures, (2) presence and degree of atypia, (3) growth pattern, (4) mitotic activity, and (5) clinical and radiological features (Varma and Shin 2013; Al-Nafussi 1999).|$|R

"You may agree," [...] wrote Andre-Louis from Paris to Le Chapelier, in {{a letter}} which survives, [...] "that {{it is to be}} regretted I <b>should</b> <b>definitely</b> have {{discarded}} the livery of Scaramouche, since clearly there could be no livery fitter for my wear. It seems to be my part always to stir up strife and then to slip away before I am caught in the crash of the warring elements I have aroused. It is a humiliating reflection. I seek consolation in the reminder of Epictetus (do you ever read Epictetus?) that we are but actors in a play of such a part as it may please the Director to assign us. It does not, however, console me to have been cast for a part so contemptible, to find myself excelling ever in the art of running away. But if I am not brave, at least I am prudent; so that where I lack one virtue I may lay claim to possessing another almost to excess. On a previous occasion they wanted to hang me for sedition. Should I have stayed to be hanged? This time they may want to hang me for several things, including murder; for I do not know whether that scoundrel Binet be alive or dead from the dose of lead I pumped into his fat paunch. Nor can I say that I very greatly care. If I have a hope at all in the matter it is that he is dead--and damned. But I am really indifferent. My own concerns are troubling me enough. I have all but spent the little money that I contrived to conceal about me before I fled from Nantes on that dreadful night; and both of the only two professions of which I can claim to know anything--the law and the stage--are closed to me, since I cannot find employment in either without revealing myself as a fellow who is urgently wanted by the hangman. As things are it is very possible that I may die of hunger, especially considering the present price of victuals in this ravenous city. Again I have recourse to Epictetus for comfort. 'It is better,' he says, 'to die of hunger having lived without grief and fear, than to live with a troubled spirit amid abundance.' I seem likely to perish in the estate that he accounts so enviable. That it does not seem exactly enviable to me merely proves that as a Stoic I am not a success." ...|$|E
