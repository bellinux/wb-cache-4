5000|$|The Société de l'assurance {{automobile}} du Québec (SAAQ), {{the provincial}} automobile insurance association in Quebec, {{conducted a study}} on driving and cellphones in 2003. Questionnaires were sent to 175,000 drivers and analysis was done on the 36,078 who responded. The questionnaire asked about driving habits, risk exposure, collisions over the past 24 months, <b>socio-demographic</b> <b>information,</b> and cell phone use. Questionnaires were supported with data from cell phone companies and accident records held by police. The {{study found that the}} overall relative risk (RR) of having an accident for cell phone users when compared to non-cell phone users averaged 1.38 across all groups. When adjusted for distance driven per year and other crash risk exposures, RR was 1.11 for men and 1.21 for women. They also found that increased cell phone use correlated with an increase in RR. When the same data were reanalyzed using a Bayesian approach, the calculated RR of 0.78 for those making less than 1 call/day and 2.27 for those with more than 7 calls/day was similar to cohort analysis. When the data were reanalyzed using case-crossover analysis, RR was calculated at a much higher 5.13. The authors expressed concern that misclassification of phone calls due to reporting errors of the exact time of the collisions was a major source of bias with all case-crossover analysis of this issue.|$|E

In choosing websites, trust in websites largely determines which website to access and how to best utilize the information. Thus, {{it is critical to}} understand why consumers trust certain websites and distrust others. A systematic literature review was conducted with the goal of identifying the antecedents of trust in health information websites. After four rounds of screening process, 20 articles between 2000 and 2013 were harvested. Factors that determine trust are classified into individual difference antecedents, website-related antecedents, and consumer-towebsite interaction-related antecedents. The most frequently studied antecedents were <b>socio-demographics,</b> <b>information</b> quality, appearance, and perceived reputation of the website.

40|$|Vaginal {{candidiasis}} (VC) {{is second}} to bacterial vaginitis, {{as the most}} common opportunistic mucosal infection that affects large numbers of otherwise healthy women of childbearing age. The incidence of VC is significantly modified by dressing patterns and aberrant health-care practices. Contemporary young women often shift their preference from skirt to trousers and leggingswhich also coincides with a rise in auto-medication and over-the-counter drugs phenomena in our communities. These could result in increased occurrence of vaginal candidiasis infection and antifungal drug resistance.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} epidemiologic characteristics of intestinal parasites in a population in south of Tehran, Iran. A retrospective cross-sectional study of patients with suspicious intestinal parasitic infections referred to the Zakaria Razi Laboratory in Shahre-Ray, southern Tehran, Iran, was conducted from April 21, 2004 to October 20, 2005. All stool samples were examined and <b>socio-demographic</b> <b>informations</b> were retrieved. Of 4, 371 referred patients, 466 (239 males and 227 females) were laboratory diagnosed with intestinal parasites, with a period prevalence of 10. 7 %. Blastocystis hominis (B. hominis) and Giardia lamblia (G. lamblia) were the most frequent intestinal parasites. More than half of patients aged ³ 18 years had a low level of educational attainment (e. g. illiterate, primary school, high school) (170 / 331, 54. 1 %). Further, majority of patients were homemakers (42. 3 %, 140 / 331) or workers (28. 1 %, 93 / 331) employed in various business settings such as food industry and construction. Findings of this study showed that intestinal parasitic infections are still a major public health challenge in Iran that needs to be addressed. We believe that public education, improving sanitation conditions of underdeveloped areas/communities, community involvement, and supporting evidence-based practice/programs are the major keys to success in preventing the spread of intestinal parasitic infections in Iran...|$|R

40|$|The historically-reactive {{approach}} to identifying safety problems and mitigating them involves selecting black spots or hot spots by ranking locations based on crash frequency and severity. The approach focuses {{mainly on the}} corridor level without taking the exposure rate (vehicle miles traveled) and <b>socio-demographics</b> <b>information</b> of the study area, which are very important in the transportation planning process, into consideration. A larger study analysis unit at the Transportation Analysis Zone (TAZ) level or the network planning level {{should be used to}} address the needs of development of the community in the future and incorporate safety into the long-range transportation planning process. In this study, existing planning tools (such as the PLANSAFE models presented in NCHRP Report 546) were evaluated for forecasting safety in small and medium-sized communities, particularly as related to changes in socio-demographics characteristics, traffic demand, road network, and countermeasures. The research also evaluated the applicability of the Empirical Bayes (EB) method to network-level analysis. In addition, application of the United States Road Assessment Program (usRAP) protocols at the local urban road network level was investigated. This research evaluated the applicability of these three methods for the City of Ames, Iowa. The outcome of this research is a systematic process and framework for considering road safety issues explicitly in the small and medium-sized community transportation planning process and for quantifying the safety impacts of new developments and policy programs. More specifically, quantitative safety may be incorporated into the planning process, through effective visualization and increased awareness of safety issues (usRAP), the identification of high-risk locations with potential for improvement, (usRAP maps and EB), countermeasures for high-risk locations (EB before and after study and PLANSAFE), and socio-economic and demographic induced changes at the planning-level (PLANSAFE) ...|$|R

40|$|Maps of {{regional}} {{morbidity and mortality}} rates are useful tools in determining spatial patterns of disease. Combined with <b>socio-demographic</b> census <b>information,</b> they also permit assessment of environmental justice, i. e., whether certain subgroups suffer disproportionately from certain diseases or other adverse effects of harmful environmental exposures. Bayes and empirical Bayes methods have proven useful in smoothing crude maps of disease risk, eliminating the instability of estimates in low-population areas while maintaining geographic resolution. In this paper we extend existing hierarchical spatial models to account for temporal effects and spatio-temporal interactions. Fitting the resulting highly-parametrized models requires careful implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, as well as novel techniques for model evaluation and selection.

Method: In this intervention type epidemiologic study, 1100 youngs were reached at 95 % level of significance by probability sampling method. These young people were given education by peer trainers; level of knowledge and attitudes of the young were evaluated before and after education. &# 8216;Young&# 8217;s Health Information Form&# 8217; prepared by the investigators and including questions about safe sexual life, family planning and STDs along with <b>socio-demographic</b> <b>informations</b> was used for data collection. In statistical analysis, &# 8216;t test&# 8217; was used for comparison of two averages, one-way anova for three groups in independent groups, &# 8216;coupled t test&# 8217; was used in dependent groups, &# 8216;qui-square test&# 8217; was used for comparison of percents in independent groups, &# 8216;McNemar qui-square test&# 8217; was used in dependent groups. Results: A total of 977 young people (females 45. 1 %, males 54. 9 %) aged between 15 - 24 years were included in the study (response ratio 88. 8 %). It was determined that 15. 6 % of unmarried young had a relationship resulted in sexual intercourse. Boys constitute the majority of the young experienced sexual intercourse and mean age of sexual intercourse was determined as 17. 6. Of the young, 43. 1 % had a sexual intercourse with a prostitute, 43. 3 % with a close friend and a girlfriend, 8. 3 % with a maquette or an animal. Total knowledge score increased to 32. 6 from 14. 6 following peer education intervention carried out based on health attitude theories (p< 0. 05). Significant improvements were detected in each of &# 8216;avoidance of sexual intercourse&# 8217;, &# 8216;being monogamous&# 8217; and &# 8216;condom use&# 8217; in the context of safe sexual life (p< 0. 05).
