This {{includes such}} requirements as that the slaughterer must be a Muslim, that the animal's head must face the Qibla, and the animal is blessed {{at the time of}} slaughter. Norwegian law requires that the animal is stunned before slaughter. This does not break halal rules, but is not the traditional method used by Muslims. The time between the stunning of the animal and the slaughter is about 20 seconds. The killing of the animal is done by cutting the two main arteries in the neck and immediately draining the animal of blood. After slaughter, the halal meat has a separate value chain until distribution.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade the number of studies {{investigating}} temperament in farm animals has increased greatly because temperament has been shown not only to affect handling but also reproduction, health and economically important production traits. However, molecular pathways underlying temperament and molecular pathways linking temperament to production traits, health and reproduction {{have yet to be}} studied in full detail. Here we report the results of metabolite profiling of the prefrontal cortex and serum of cattle with distinct temperament types that were performed to further explore their molecular divergence in the response to the <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedure</b> and to identify new targets for further research of cattle temperament. By performing an untargeted comprehensive metabolite profiling, 627 and 1097 metabolite features comprising 235 and 328 metabolites could be detected in the prefrontal cortex and serum, respectively. In total, 54 prefrontal cortex and 51 serum metabolite features were indicated to have a high relevance in the classification of temperament types by a sparse partial least square discriminant analysis. A clear discrimination between fearful/neophobic-alert, interested-stressed, subdued/uninterested-calm and outgoing/neophilic-alert temperament types could be observed based on the abundance of the identified relevant prefrontal cortex and serum metabolites. Metabolites with high relevance in the classification of temperament types revealed that the main differences between temperament types in the response to the <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedure</b> were related to the abundance of glycerophospholipids, fatty acyls and sterol lipids. Differences in the abundance of metabolites related to C 21 steroid metabolism and oxidative stress indicated that the differences in the metabolite profiles of the four extreme temperament types could be the result of a temperament type specific regulation of molecular pathways that are known {{to be involved in the}} stress and fear response...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} 1 min {{exposure}} to 80 % CO 2 inhalation was studied in rats under light general anaesthesia with N 2 O. It {{was found that}} 80 % CO 2 gave a rapid slowing of the EEG {{as well as a}} rapid decrease of the amplitude of cortical somatosensory evoked potentials. Only minor influences upon the blood pressure and heart rate were seen.

40|$|European {{legislation}} {{states that}} after stunning regular checks {{should be performed}} to guarantee animals are unconscious {{between the end of}} the stunning process and death. When animals are killed without prior stunning these checks should be performed before the animal is released from restraint. The validity of certain indicators used to assess unconsciousness under different stunning and slaughter conditions is under debate. The aim {{of this study was to}} validate the absence of threat-, withdrawal-, corneal- and eyelid reflex as indicators to assess unconsciousness in calves subjected to different stunning and slaughter methods. Calves (201 ± 22 kg) were randomly assigned to one of the following four treatments: (1) Captive bolt stunning followed by neck cut in an inverted position (n= 25); (2) Non-stunned slaughter in an upright position (n= 7); (3) Non-stunned slaughter in an inverted position (180 ° rotation) (n= 25); (4) Non-stunned slaughter in an upright position followed by captive bolt stunning 40 s after the neck cut (n= 25). Each calf was equipped with non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes before the <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedure.</b> All reflexes were verified once before the <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedure.</b> At the beginning of the procedure (T= 0 s) calves were stunned (treatment 1) or neck cut in an upright position (treatment 2, 4) or inverted position (treatment 3). Calves of treatment 4 were captive bolt stunned 34 ± 8 s after the neck cut. Reflexes were assessed every 20 s from T= 15 s for all treatments until all reflex tests resulted in a negative response three times in a row and a flat line EEG was observed. In addition, reflexes were assessed 5 s after captive bolt stunning in calves of treatments 1 and 4. Visual assessment of changes in the amplitude and frequency of EEG traces was used to determine loss of consciousness. Timing of loss of consciousness was related to timing of loss of reflexes. After captive bolt stunning, absence of threat-, withdrawal-, corneal- and eyelid reflex indicated unconsciousness as determined by EEG recordings. After non-stunned slaughter, both threat- and withdrawal reflex were on average lost before calves were unconscious based on EEG recordings. The eyelid- and corneal reflex were on average lost after calves had lost consciousness based on EEG recordings and appeared to be distinctly conservative indicators of unconsciousness in non-stunned slaughtered calves since they were observed until 76 ± 50 and 85 ± 45 s (mean±SD), respectively, after EEG-based loss of consciousness. </p...|$|E

Meat and meat products are subjected to reduce during chilling and freezing temperatures principal for reasons of conservation or meat packing. Particular attention must be paid to temperature control, especially before rigor mortis, knowing that too rapid cooling could lead to a cold shortening or thaw rigor during the thaw. During application of the electrostimulation process, occur physical and biochemical changes, meaning that this one has some effect on the technological properties of meat. It has obtained a reduction of maturation of beef with the electrostimulation of half-carcasses of cattle, verified by the increase of non-protein nitrogen in meat.

40|$|There is an {{abundance}} of critical hygiene points {{in connection with the}} handling of the head and the harvesting of head tissues. If a wide range of precautions is not taken, then the danger of cross-contamination of carcasses, abattoir workers, the environment, equipment, and even wastewater is unavoidable. The most critical process stage, in terms of edible meat contamination with specified risk material (SRM), is the current common practice of the longitudinal splitting of the carcass. The carcass splitting saw poses a particular risk in terms of cross-contamination of carcasses, equipment, surfaces and operatives.

Sixty-four male piglets were housed in 32 metabolic cages (two animals per cage) during the first 14 d postweaning. At day 15, only one animal per cage was kept until day 28. Body composition, energy, and nutrient deposition rates and energy utilization efficiency were measured through a comparative <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedure.</b> Piglets with light WW had a poorer feed conversion ratio and lower weight gain and feed intake when expressed per live weight. Increased ME led to greater daily fat deposition in the empty bodies (defined as weighted mean of the carcass + organs + blood, no intestinal content), while light WW piglets had a reduced protein deposition. Light WW piglets increased heat production with increased ME, but no effect was seen for the heavy WW piglets. By contrast, heavy WW piglets increased empty body gross energy as ME increased, while no influence was observed on light WW piglets. Increasing dietary energy levels did not contribute to the subsequent growth performance of piglets that were lighter at weaning. The lack of interaction between weaning weight and dietary ME content on growth performance does not support the hypothesis that light piglets at weaning do not exhibit compensatory growth because of limitations in energy intake...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the mobilization of nutrients in goats of different gestation types and pregnancy stages. Forty-four Saanen and Oberhasli goats were studied. The goats of each breed and gestation type (single or twin) were slaughtered at different gestational ages (80, 110, and 140 days of pregnancy), forming a completely randomized design in a 2 × 3 × 2 factorial arrangement (two breeds, three gestational ages, and two types of pregnancy). The <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedure</b> involved separating the empty body, mammary glands, uterus with membranes and fetal fluid, and fetus(es). For the females slaughtered at 140 days of pregnancy, blood was collected to analyze metabolites and hormones every 15 days during gestation. The dry matter (DM) intake was lower in goats with twin pregnancies. The relative daily retention rate of the nutrients in the body was positive at 100 days of pregnancy but became negative at 140 days (- 0. 18 ± 0. 25 g DM kg- 1 of maternal body d- 1) and did not differ with breed or number of fetuses. Fetal growth in twin pregnancies was 66 % higher than in single pregnancies. The highest levels of ß-hydroxybutyrate and non-esterified fatty acids were observed beginning at 100 days of gestation. Serum total protein and albumin levels decreased after 125 days of gestation. Serum urea levels were reduced after 80 days of gestation. Plasma 17 ß-estradiol levels increased with the advance of pregnancy, and IGF- 1 was highest between 60 and 80 days of gestation.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to detect the principal reasons for condemnation of poultry carcasses in two slaughterhouses (A and B); located in the southeastern region of the State of Goiás, Brazil. The data were collected by the federal veterinary inspection services of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture between January and April 2007. The principal causes of condemnation observed in both industries were cellulite, contusion/ fractures and bruises, as well as contamination due to gut severance at evisceration. The three main values observed for each of the causes were different between the slaughter houses. In A, cellulite was the main cause of condemnation with 51. 20 % of all condemnations, followed by 5. 67 % for contusion/ fractures and bruising and 33. 61 % for contamination by evisceration. In B, the major cause of condemnation was 28. 90 % due to fractures/ contusion and bruising, followed by 25. 27 % for cellulite and 22. 50 % for contamination. Other causes of condemnation were observed, however in minute quantities in both industries (< 10 % to A and < 23 % to B). The high cellulite occurrence in A was due to the high density of the poultry in sheds (17 or 18 chickens m- 2). The greater value for fractures/ contusion and bruising verified in B was due to the inefficiency during capture in the sheds and putting on hooks in the slaughterhouse. Carcass lesions were also caused by insensitization because of non-uniformity in the poultry groups. Contamination by residues due to gut severance, mainly intestines, was attributed to problems in adjustment of machinery and non- uniformity of lots in industry A. In industry B the value detected within an acceptable level of failure in evisceration for machine, according to the manufacturer.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present thesis was to obtain more fundamental understanding of the mechanisms for variations in colour and colour stability of fresh pork. The effects of breed and genotype, including Duroc, Hampshire (three RN alleles), Landrace and Yorkshire pigs, were studied. Furthermore, effects of strategic feeding with creatine, pre-slaughter treatment, <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedure</b> and carcass cooling on muscle metabolism and ultimate colour and colour stability were studied. It was concluded that the early progress in post mortem temperature and pH decline affect the colour of pork independent of whether this is triggered by variations in genotype, feed-induced changes, pre-slaughter stress or cooling rate. The level of oxymyoglobin was shown {{to be more important}} for the colour of pork during retail display, than the level of metmyoglobin. A high level of oxymyoglobin preserves high redness despite of oxidation to metmyoglobin. Ageing of pork for a week increased the ability of pork to stimulate oxygenation of deoxymyoglobin to oxymyoglobin, i. e. blooming, without compromising the colour stability during four days of subsequent retail display. Hence, ageing results in lighter, redder and more yellow pork colour. It was further concluded that genetics giving rise to variation in the colour of pork is related to differences in pigment content and in muscle metabolism. The latter influences the redox status of the muscle and the activity of oxygen-consuming and metmyoglobin-reducing enzymes and accordingly the relative proportion of the myoglobin species. The colour of pork from Landrace pigs was generally lighter, redder and more yellow than pork from Duroc pigs due to higher level of oxymyoglobin at the meat surface, i. e. more intense blooming. The colour of pork from Hampshire pigs was highly related to the RN genotype. Pork from carriers of the RN- allele was generally lighter, redder and more yellow than that from non-carriers of the RN- allele, and the rn* (V 199 I) allele tended to decrease redness and yellowness...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 251 growing-finishing Iberian (IB) pigs, 32 {{of which were}} {{suckling}} piglets, were used in 5 separate sets of trials. The comparative <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedure</b> {{was used to determine}} nutrient and energy retention at several stages of growth from birth to 150 kg BW. A factorial arrangement was used within each set of trials, involving several concentrations of ideal protein in the diets as 1 factor and 2 or 3 levels of feed intake as the other. The main objective of these studies was to derive the optimal protein-to-energy ratio in the diet to allow for the expression of maximum protein deposition rates. The effect of feed restriction on growth performance, protein deposition, and fat deposition was also assessed. According to allometric equations, empty BW (EBW) was related to whole body components or total chemical constituents of empty body mass (P < 0. 001). For pigs receiving solid feed, highly statistically significant multiple regression equations were constructed, which derived nutrient (g/kg) or energy (MJ/kg) composition as a function of EBW, dietary protein-to-energy ratio, and level of feeding (P < 0. 001). In pigs offered adequate protein-to-energy diets, ADG at each stage of production was predicted {{as a function of the}} average BW and feeding level (P < 0. 001). It was observed that the estimates of ME required for maintenance and net efficiency of utilization of ME for growth change were within rather narrow ranges throughout the growth stages studied. Preferred values (413 kJ/kg BW(0. 75) × d(- 1) and 0. 593 for ME(m) and k(g), respectively) were obtained by regressing total energy retention (kJ/kg BW(0. 75) × d(- 1)) against ME intake (kJ/kg BW(0. 75) × d(- 1)). A multiple-regression approach revealed that in the IB pig, ME costs for protein deposition and fat deposition reach 60 and 62 kJ/g, which is considerably greater than in conventional or lean pig genotypes. In the IB pig, the maximum daily rate of protein deposition (PD(max), g) seemed to follow a linear-plateau shape with a breaking point at 32. 5 kg BW, beyond which PD(max) remained at an average rate of 75 g × d(- 1). The marginal efficiency of body protein deposition was estimated at each growth stage. In pigs fed on optimal or suboptimal protein-to-energy diets, the relationship between PD and ME intake declined, following a curvilinear pattern with increasing BW; thus, implying relative increases in lipid gain as BW increased...|$|E

PALAVRAS-CHAVES: Bem-estar animal, Brasil, senciência.  Society {{is in need}} of {{information}} regarding fish welfare, including sentience and suffering through fish farming and slaughter methods. The objectives of this work were: (1) to increase knowledge regarding public opinion on fish humane slaughter; and (2) {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} education of fish cleaners on the fair regarding fish humane slaughter. Interviews were applied in two scenarios: on a Municipal Live Fish Fair and on a bus station. In the fair 88. 0 % of 314 respondents affirmed that fish feel pain; and on the bus station, 86. 9 % of 43 interviewed people affirmed the same; 55. 7 % reported to buy and transport live fish in dry plastic bags, characterizing slow death by asphyxiation, as opposed to 39. 5 % respectively. From interviewed people, 85. 0 % and 89. 0 % believe that some of the slaughter methods cause fish suffering; 52. 9 % and 44. 1 % affirmed this suffering affect meat quality, respectively. Of all people, 91. 1 % did not have any information regarding humane slaughter. Of the cleaners, 83. 3 % adopted the humane <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedure</b> taught and 75. 0 % affirmed that the technique facilitated the cleaning work. It is important to educate society in terms of fish sentience and its implications, especially in terms of their welfare and humane slaughter. KEY WORDS: Animal welfare, Brazil, sentience...|$|E
40|$|In modern pork {{production}} it {{is important}} to maximize the animal’s potential for daily lean gain by increasing the body protein deposition with as little wastage of the ingested amino acids as possible. Therefore, {{it is important}} to maximize the efficiency with which dietary amino acids are used for protein deposition or lean gain. This efficiency is measured by using nitrogen balance studies or comparative <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedures.</b> Supplementing swine diets with crystalline amino acids and replacing part of the dietary protein can reduce diet cost and will also reduce the amount of nitrogen excreted in manure. However, it has been demonstrated that the efficiency of utilization of crystalline amino acids may be lower than that of amino acids bound in protein. Although the reasons for this are unclear, it may be associated with the frequency of feeding and differences in the rate of absorption between the two sources of amino acids. Research in progress is designed to investigate the efficiency with which crystalline lysine is utilized for protein deposition in nursery pigs. This research will obtain additional information about the relative utilization of crystalline and protein-bound amino acids...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitiveness}} {{of different}} demersal and pelagic fish species of 70 hauls in the North and Baltic Sea in water depths of 60 to 250 m and 15 to 80 m, respectively, amount of catch of 100 to 3500 kg and trawling times of 0, 5 to 6 h on {{board of the}} FRV “Walther Herwig III” was investigated. Some demersal fish species, e. g. saithe (Pollachius virens), were even still sensitive, when caught at a water depth of 250 m at a trawling time of 1, 5 h. Generally the number of sensitive fishes was reduced with increasing water depth, amount of catch, trawling time and following storage of the catch on board. Among demersal fishes the species without swimbladder and flat fishes were clearly more resistent to mechanical stress. On the contrary, pelagic fish species were generally less robust. After trawling times of 2 h no sensitive animals were observed. In some fisheries there are mixed catches of demersal and pelagic fish species with different sensitiveness. In commercial fisheries, there is therefore – under animal welfare aspects – for the time being, no prospect for an improvement of the catching and <b>slaughtering</b> <b>procedure</b> on boar...|$|R

40|$|Ziel dieser Arbeit war es, den Einfluss von Plasmaexpandern (HES, Dextran, Gelatine) auf die endothelabhängigen, vasoaktiven Faktoren (EDHF/NO) an der rechten Herzkranzgefäß-arterie von Schweinen zu untersuchen. Das Endothel ist an der Regulation des kontraktilen Status der glatten Gefäßmuskulatur beteiligt und kann u. a. über den vom Endothel stammen-den Relaxierungsfaktor (EDRF), Prostazyklin (PGI 2) und den EDHF eine Dilatation herbei-führen. Das Probenmaterial (Herzkranzgefäße) wurde von gerade geschlachteten Hausschwei-nen während eines normalen Schlachtvorganges entnommen, später im Labor in 5 mm lange Gefäßringe geschnitten und dann in der Versuchsapparatur die Kontraktion/Dilatation gemes-sen und dokumentiert. Jeder Gefäßring durchlief jeweils drei Messdurchgänge: dabei wurde die EDR mit der Relaxation über den EDHF verglichen; einerseits im Kontrollversuch ohne Studiensubstanz und andererseits in den Versuchen mit Zusatz der Studiensubstanzen. Das Gleiche wurde nach einer 24 stündigen Konservierung erneut mit neuen Koronararterienteil-stücken durchgeführt. In den Kontrollversuchen zeigten sich fast ausschließlich signifikante Unterschiede in dem intraindividuellen Vergleich des ersten Messdurchgangs mit dem zweiten, bei dem tendenziell eine Reduktion der Dilatationsfähigkeit beobachtet wurde. Bei allen Gefäßteilstücken konnten im Rahmen der EDR höhere Werte abgelesen werden als bei der Relaxation über den EDHF, da bei der EDR sowohl NO als auch der EDHF beteiligt sind, und bei der EDHF-abhängigen Dilatation die NO-Synthase inhibiert wurde. In den Versuchen mit den frischen Koronargefäßen war während der ersten Messdurchgänge die Dilatation stär-ker als bei den konservierten Gefäßringen. Die drei Kolloide führten unabhängig von ihrer jeweiligen Konzentration im zweiten Messdurchgang zu einer geringer ausgeprägten Dilata-tionskurve gegenüber den Kontrollversuchen; tendenziell war dieser Einfluss am deutlichsten unter Gelatine während mit Dextran die geringste Beeinträchtigung abzulesen war. In der EDR fand durch die Plasmaexpander eine Kompensation statt, deutlich an dem fast deckungsgleichen Kurvenverlauf der Kontrolle mit den Kurven mit Studiensubstanz: Die Mittelwerte der Kontrollversuche erreichten nach der Konservierung nicht mehr so hohe Werte wie bei den frischen Gefäßringen; mit den Studiensubstanzen fand tendenziell keine derart massive Reduktion wie durch die Konservierung statt. Eine ähnliche Kompensation konnte beim EDHF nicht beobachtet werden. Wir können von einem deutlichen Einfluss der Plasmaexpander auf die endotheliale Funktion der porcinen Herzkranzgefäßen ausgehen mit einer eindeutigen Tendenz hinsichtlich einer Reduktion der Dilatationsfähigkeit sowohl für die EDR als auch für den EDHF, immer wieder betont durch signifikante Unterschiede. The {{intent of}} this {{dissertation}} {{was to investigate}} the effects of plasmaexpanders (Hydroxy-ethylstarch, Dextran and Gelatine) on endotheliumdependent, vasoactive factors especially EDHF and NO in the right coronary artery of pigs. The endothelium is involved in the regulation of the vascular smooth muscle contractile state and has the ability to cause a dilation by the Endothelium derived relaxing factor (EDRF), Prostacyclin and the EDHF. The organic samples {{in the form of the}} coronary arteries were cut out of just slaughtered pigs during a usual <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedure</b> at the slaughterhouse, later on in the laboratory they were cut into 5 mm long rings clamped in the organ bath of the experimental set-up and contraction/ dilation were measured and documented. Each coronary ring went through three testings in which we compared the EDR with the relaxation by the EDHF; on one hand in the control group without plasmaexpanders and on the other hand in the experiments with added colloids. This experiment procedure was repeated after a 24 hour preservation of the coronary arteries with newly cut rings. Almost exclusively significant differences could be observed between the first and second testing within the intraindividual comparison of the control group. Hereby the graph of the second testing tended to a reduction of the ability of dilation. Regarding the dilation of all coronary rings higher results for the EDR could be ascertained in comparison to the relaxation due to the EDHF. The latter depends on a participation of both NO and EDHF in the EDR and because of the NO-synthase inhibition within the EDHF depending dilation. When comparing the first testings of the experiment with the fresh coronary arteries the dilation was more obvious than for the preserved vessel rings. The experiments showed a reduction for all three colloids independent to their particular concentration in the second experiment procedure when compared to the graphs of the control group; by trend this became most obvious for Gelatine while the least impact was obtained under the influence of Dextran. A compensation by the colloids could be detected for the EDR, verified by the almost congruent behaviour of the control group with the graphs with colloids. The averages of the control group were not as high after the preservation as the ones of the fresh coronary artery rings; when applying the colloids the massive impairment due to the preservation tended to be reduced. A similar compensation for the EDHF could not be detected. We can determine a considerable influence of plasmaexpanders on the endothelial function in the coronary arteries of pigs with a distinct tendency in terms of a reduction of the ability to dilate as well for the EDR as for the EDHF emphasized by various significant findings...|$|E

40|$|The {{concern about}} the welfare of {{livestock}} during transport is increasing as animal production and transport for slaugh- ter and breeding is increasing. The main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the characteristics of animal supply and activities in slaughter chain in the Kumasi abattoir, Ghana. The main stakeholders were indentified and interviewed. Based on the data and information gathered (through interview, field measurements, observation and activity registra- tion), the main characteristics of the animal supply and activities in the abattoir chain were mapped out. The study indi- cated that the animals were sourced from inside and outside Ghana. The purchased animals were first sent to a local collection centre before onward transportation to the Cattle Market in the Kumasi city, where the animals should stay until sold and taken to abattoir to be slaughtered. The study indicated that inhuman way of animal handling, incidence of non-ambulation, sickness and death of animals were common during transport as well as inside Kumasi cattle market. The <b>slaughtering</b> <b>procedures</b> and meat distribution to the butcheries lacked good hygienic conditions compromising meat safety and quality. These issues of animal welfare and meat safety and quality should get attention and improve- ments must be planned...|$|R
40|$|Campylobacter jejuni* (*C. jejuni*) is a spiral, comma-shaped Gram-negative {{bacterium}} {{which is}} motile due to bipolar flagella. *C. jejuni* is frequently {{present in the}} intestines of poultry and birds, where it {{is considered to be}} part of the normal intestinal flora (1). During <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedures,</b> poultry meat products often become contaminated with fecal content containing *C. jejuni* (2, 3). As a consequence of the extensive consumption of chicken worldwide, the handling of raw chicken and ingestion of undercooked chicken meat are the main causes of *C. jejuni* infection in humans (3). Apart from poultry, other sources of *C. jejuni* infection include raw milk, (swimming) water and pets (4). Upon ingestion, *C. jejuni* can pass through the human gastrointestinal tract without clinical symptoms; however, infection with *C. jejuni* will often lead to a diarrheal illness (5). In the Netherlands, approximately 80, 000 people per year (range, 30, 000 – 160, 000) are estimated to experience acute gastroenteritis caused by *Campylobacter* (6). The symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, and slimy or bloody diarrhea that lasts for several days (7). *C. jejuni* diarrhea is self-limiting, though complications such as bacteraemia, post-infectious reactive arthritis or Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) occasionally occur. In view of the broad spectrum of clinical disease presentations associated with *C. jejuni* infection, microbial as well as host factors are likely to contribute to *C. jejuni* pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{procedures}} which quantify {{protein value}} {{are expected to}} beneficially influence efficiency of nutrient provision in dietary formulations for the livestock, industry. This thesis provides a review of two widely employed quantitative assessments, "Digestibility" and "Availability" and in the experimental section describes a series of experiments undertaken on meat chicken to refine assay procedures involved in the determination of protein and amino acid apparent ileal digestibility values. Five experiments were undertaken. (1 a) A comparison of two feeding procedures with three diets differing in particle size {{with a view to}} evaluating the effect of feeding behaviour on the final composition of the test diet in the crop. (1 b) Determination of crop residue composition associated with time following feeding with two feeding procedures and two diets differing in particle size. (2) A comparison of the effects of two <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedures</b> and two flushing solutions on ileal N digestibility of meat and bone meal. (3) A comparison of the effect of time of slaughter following feeding on ileal N values of two diets. (4) Determination of the effect of length of ileum on ileal N digestibility values of two diets. (5) Determination of the effect of age on ileal N and AA digestibilities of two diets. In 1 a there was clear evidence that bird eating behaviour and particle size of the test diet influenced crop content proportions of a number of criteria, more notably chromium and nitrogen. For coarse particle diets an intubation feeding procedure produced a closer match of material in the crop with that of the untouched diet than a free access provision of food procedure. In 1 b {{the results of the study}} were inconclusive and no satisfactory cause for inconsistencies that developed between treatments could be found. In 2, two <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedures,</b> euthanasia by sodium pentobarbitone and asphyxiation by carbon dioxide, resulted in significantly different (P< 0. 05) apparent ileal nitrogen (N) digestibility. Differences between flushing solutions, distilled water and physiological saline were small and not significant (P< 0. 05). In 3, for two diet types, N and dry matter (DM) digestibilities were relatively constant over sampling times of 2 to 5 hours following the start of feeding. Ileal digesta sampled quantities tended to be greatest at the 4 hour sampling interval. In 4, differences in N and DM digestibilities of digesta samples drawn from sections of the ileum up to 30 cm in length as measured from the ileo-caecal junction were generally small and non significant. In 5, bird age had no significant effect on N and DM digestibilities. The main conclusions drawn were that intubation better retained the integrity of food reaching the crop. Sodium pentobarbitone was a preferable method of slaughter. Ileal length sampled needed to be kept as short as consistant with providing adequate sample material and largest sample sizes were obtainable around 4 hours following the start of feeding...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} were done {{to determine whether}} short-term supplementation (5 days pre-slaughter) with magnesium acetate, {{or a combination of}} magnesium acetate, tryptophan, vitamin E and vitamin C would improve pork quality. In the first experiment the pigs (Pietrain x Yorkshire, n = 96) were fed a standard feed or a magnesium supplemented feed for 5 days prior to slaughter. As a possible stress factor half of the animals were slaughtered upon arrival at the slaughterplant whereas the remaining animals were allowed two hours of rest in lairage before slaughter. Magnesium supplementation did not result in an increase in plasma magnesium concentration at slaughter. Omission of lairage resulted in higher plasma glucose concentrations, but plasma lactate concentrations were not affected. Drip loss and ultimate pH were not affected by diet or omission of lairage. Omission of lairage resulted in poorer color characteristics. This effect was prevented by supplementation with magnesium. In the second experiment the pigs (Pietrain x Yorkshire, n = 92) were fed a standard feed or this standard feed supplemented with magnesium acetate, tryptophan, vitamin E and vitamin C for 5 days prior to slaughter. Supplementation with vitamin E did not increase muscle vitamin E concentration. Inclusion of supplements in the diet failed to improve water-holding capacity or color characteristics. These results indicate that short-term supplementation with magnesium acetate, tryptophan, vitamin E and vitamin C is of little value in improving pork quality when pigs are not stressed beyond levels associated with routine <b>slaughter</b> <b>procedures.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
