The above water leaves transpire water to lower the water level further and add additional leaf litter to the soil. Eventually the <b>sedge</b> <b>peat</b> accumulates above the water level and soil is no longer totally waterlogged.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{following}} four organic amendments to ameliorate saline soil in coastal northern China was investigated from April 2010 to October 2012 in a field experiment: green waste compost (GWC), <b>sedge</b> <b>peat</b> (SP), furfural residue (FR), and a mixture of GWC, SP and FR (1 ∶ 1 ∶ 1 by volume) (GSF). Compared to a non-amended control (CK), the amendments, which were applied at 4. 5 kg organic matter m(- 3), dramatically promoted plant growth; improved soil structure; increased the cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic carbon, and available nutrients; and reduced the salt content, electrical conductivity (EC), and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). At {{the end of the}} experiment in soil amended with GSF, bulk density, EC, and ESP had decreased by 11, 87, and 71 %, respectively, and total porosity and organic carbon had increased by 25 and 96 % respectively, relative to the CK. The GSF treatment resulted in a significantly lower Na(+) +K(+) content than the other treatments. CEC and the contents of available N, P, and K were significantly higher in the GSF-treated soil than in the CK and were the highest in all treatments. The FR treatment resulted in the lowest pH value and Ca(2 +) concentration, which decreased by 8 % and 39 %, respectively, relative to the CK. Overall, the results indicate that a combination of green waste compost, <b>sedge</b> <b>peat</b> and furfural residue (GSF treatment) has substantial potential for ameliorating saline soils in the coastal areas of northern China, and it works better than each amendment alone.

Although we found no significant influence of inundation on decay rate when bags from all study sites were analyzed together, decay rates at two of the sites increased with greater flooding. These findings suggest that flooding may enhance organic matter decay rates even in water-logged soils, but that the overall influence of flooding is minor. Our experiments suggest that sea-level rise will not accelerate rates of peat accumulation by slowing the rate of soil organic matter decay. Consequently, marshes will require enhanced organic matter productivity or mineral sediment deposition to survive accelerating sea-level rise...|$|E

Thirlmere Lakes, N. S. W., are located in an incised former river valley which has undergone considerable infilling with sediments prior to, and possibly during the formation of the lakes. [...] Research into the geomorphic processes operating in and around the lakes has shown that organic sediment, in the form of <b>sedge</b> <b>peat,</b> is the main type of deposit accumulating in the lakes at the present time.

Bushfire appears to be a major influence on the initiation of sediment transport on the surrounding hillslopes and alluvial fans.

Pollen and plant macroremain studies provide information on vegetation development in the surroundings of the lake, including Stone Age settlements of Braukšas I and Braukšas II. Results of the investigations indicate that the development of vegetation together with sedimentation conditions in the palaeolake have changed since the Younger Dryas until today. Vegetation composition varies {{in different parts of the}} ancient Lake Burtnieks area due to past changes in lake water level which reached different sites at different times. Data from the northern part of ancient Lake Burtnieks indicate its gradual overgrowing since the Preboreal.

40|$|Northern peatlands are {{important}} to the global carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. Peat profiles in Rocky Mountain areas commonly show complex stratigraphy with underlying and/or interbedded mineral sediments, referred to as stratified mineral horizons. Stratified mineral horizons usually have lower hydraulic conductivity and more electron acceptors, which influences biogeochemical processes. To study the effect of mineral sediments on pedological and biogeochemical processes, I conducted a field study and a microcosm study. The field study was located in a mountain peatland {{in the foothills of the}} Canadian Rocky Mountains with three different organic soil types: sedge peat/silty sediments/calcareous sediments (PMC), <b>sedge</b> peat/silty sediments/moss <b>peat</b> (PMP) and <b>sedge</b> peat/moss <b>peat</b> (PP). Soil samples were tested for spatial distribution of total organic C (TOC), total N (TN), pH, volumetric water content (θv), C and N cycling rates, C composition and microbial community structure. A microcosm study was designed to mimic climate warming conditions with four temperature-water table treatments: current temperature/current water table, higher temperature/current water table, current temperature/lower water table, and higher temperature/lower water table. In the microcosm study, PMC and PP soils were incubated for 28 days and tested for GHG emissions and concentrations, biogeochemical process rates, apparent enzyme activation energy (Ea) and bacterial community structure. In the field study, results indicated mineral sediments mainly affect pedological and biogeochemical processes in subsurface peat rather than surface peat. Mineral sediments affected the spatial distributions of total organic C (TOC), total N (TN), pH and volumetric water content (θv) via elevating the pH adjacent to calcareous sediments and slowing water infiltration to lower depths. The pH and θv further affected TOC and TN distribution by regulating organic matter decomposition during the peatland’s geomorphic history. At the same time, mineral sediments also affected C and N cycling processes, though depth had an even greater effect. The effect of mineral sediments on N cycling was mainly due to high pH from calcareous sediments, which promoted net nitrification but lowered net ammonification in the PMC. Moreover, mineral sediment mitigated the lag phase of N cycling in deeper layers. The effect of mineral sediments on C cycling was reflected in two aspects, geomorphic history and hydrological conditions. During the peatland’s geomorphic history, mineral horizons promoted decomposition by increasing pH and providing electron acceptors in overlying peat. Enhanced decomposition in the past resulted in more recalcitrant materials in peat at present. This, combined with physicochemical protection of C by mineral sediments, further restricted C mineralization in the PMP and PMC. Hydrologically, stratified mineral horizons slowed water infiltration and resulted in higher θv above the mineral horizon and lower θv below the mineral horizon. This restricted C mineralization in peat above mineral sediment and encouraged C mineralization in peat below mineral sediment in PMP. In addition, these factors also affected microbial community structure, with the highest Stress and Bacteria:Fungi ratio in peat above mineral sediment and different microbial community structure in peat below mineral sediments. In the microcosm study, I found that high temperature increased GHG emission and GHG concentration – especially at depth – in most samples. Soil types affected CO 2 and N 2 O concentrations from subsurface horizons: PP had higher CO 2 and N 2 O than PMC. Importantly, N 2 O concentration and production rates were affected by interaction of soil types and temperature near the water table: N 2 O production in PP was more enhanced by high temperature. This was possibly because PP had greater labile C and lower pH. In addition, compared with PP, the Ea for N 2 O generation in PMC was increased more by high temperature incubation and microbial community structures were quite different in the two soils, especially the lower relative abundance of copiotrophs in PMC. Overall, the findings highlight that stratified mineral sediment affected spatial distribution of key soil properties, which influenced biogeochemical processes in this mountain peatland. Elevated pH due to calcareous sediment promoted nitrification and C mineralization. In addition, stratified mineral sediment affected θv, which then affected microbial community structure and C mineralization. Under a warming climate, compared with a continuous peat profile, peat with mineral sediments tends to have less labile C and higher pH, which could potentially result in less CO 2 and N 2 O emission and mitigate N 2 O production proximal to the water table...|$|R

The events at Crudale Meadow are consistent with those recorded at other sites from Britain, Ireland and elsewhere, and can be correlated with isotopic changes shown by the Greenland ice cores. The multi-proxy approach enriches the environmental reconstructions from the site, although the synchronicity of the response of the various proxies is sometimes equivocal, depending upon the time period concerned, taphonomy, {{and the nature of the}} deposits.

40|$|Tropical peatlands {{provide a}} number of {{ecosystem}} services – including biodiversity, habitat, carbon and water cycling, and commodity products – and have among the highest carbon densities of any forest on earth. Almost half of tropical peatlands supporting the growth of peat swamp forests are in Indonesia. Rates of deforestation there and hence C emissions are very high, but {{few studies have examined}} C dynamics of these forests. We present the initial results of the development of a model of peat accumulation in tropical swamp forests over millennia. In this study, the Holocene Peat Model (HPM), which has been successfully applied to northern peatlands, was modified for tropical ecosystems. HPMTrop is a one-dimensional, non-linear, dynamic model with a monthly time step that simulates mass remaining in annual peat cohorts as a balance between vegetation inputs and decomposition. We utilized as model parameters published data on vegetation characteristics, including net primary production (NPP); NPP partitioning into leaves, wood, and roots; and litter decomposition rates. A stochastic mix of wet and dry years controlled the peat swamp water table depth. Over 8, 000 years, HPMTrop simulated a peat accumulation of 3. 9 m, which is equivalent to a net accumulation of about 2, 200 Mg Cha- 1. At the end of the simulation, 55 % of the accumulated peat carbon was derived from wood inputs, 31 % from roots, and 14 % from leaves. In a modeled scenario of dominance by non-tree vegetation (<b>sedge),</b> <b>peat</b> accumulation was dramatically lower; only about 1 m (about 550 Mg Cha- 1) over 8, 000 years.

Conventional and AMS- 14 C-datings supported their chronostratigraphical classification. The uppermost till (E 1) was incised by late glacial channels filled with glaciolacustrine sediments (E 2) of the early Baltic Ice Lake stages. These were regionally overlain with a sharp unconformity by a thick (locally > 20 m) sedimentary complex (E 3) of acoustically laminated silts of freshwater origin.

Fine plant debris in the uppermost part of sub-unit E 3 a yielded ages of 10, 100 and 10, 500 14 C-years B. P., representing the final phase of the Baltic Ice Lake. The fine sands of sub-unit E 3 b were deposited after the final drainage of the Baltic Ice Lake. In the shallower central part of the bay, the silts of sub-unit E 3 a were covered by a younger unit (E 4) of fine sand with plant debris. A <b>sedge</b> <b>peat</b> occurring at the basis of unit E 4 yielded an age of 9, 590 14 C-years B. P.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze and explain the architecture, facies distribution, age and origin of coarse-grained overbank deposits, with special attention for organic-clastic lake fills, and organics in the distal Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta plain. In order to depict the influence of lakes and their fills on the development and architecture of fluvial systems, I reconstructed the development in the Angstel-Vecht area. To obtain insight in the facies composition, architecture and formation of organic-clastic lake fills, I investigated these deposits in the central delta and in an area adjacent to the central delta. It was shown that delta-plain lakes affect downstream architecture and facies composition of fluvial deposits. Owing to trapping of the coarsest sediment grains in lakes, channel deposits downstream of lakes are relatively fine-grained and are accompanied by relatively thin natural-levee deposits. The large proportion of sand that is contained in organic-clastic lake fills, in addition, provides weak channel banks compared to the clay and peat usually found in distal delta plains. Channels that traverse organic-clastic lake fills, therefore, {{have a tendency to}} meander instead of being straight. Additionally, a synthesizing conceptual model is presented that describes the development of these deposits. The sedimentary and botanical variability of the basal-peat layer was described, first, by designing a key for classifying organics. The classification key for organics enabled identification of four types of sedimentary organic facies (algal, detrital, calcareous and siderite gyttja) and four botanical-organic facies (wood, reed, <b>sedge</b> and oligotrophic <b>peat).</b> Second, application of this key on archived borehole descriptions resulted in determination of the distribution of organic facies in the basal-peat layer in the distal part of the Rhine-Meuse delta in ~ 4000 cores. These data were interpolated, which resulted in a distribution map of basal-peat organic facies. It was feasible to obtain the spatial distribution and spatial proportion of reed peat (63 %), wood peat (8 %) and gyttja (29 %). Organic facies variability in the basal-peat layer indicates the presence of three main hydrological domains that characterized the onset of Holocene aggradation in the Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta: marine-dominated, fluvial-dominated and seepage-dominated. I used existing valley-wide cross sections to determine the delta-scale spatial and temporal distribution and lithofacies composition of coarse-grained overbank deposits. The results show that both narrow and wide floodbasins tend to have relatively low proportions of crevasse-splay deposits whereas intermediate floodbasin widths, 3. 1 - 3. 6 km in the Rhine-Meuse delta, yield optimum crevasse-splay deposit proportions. The lithofacies composition of crevasse-splay deposits and organic-clastic lake fills is found to be controlled by channel planform, superelevation and by the composition of the substratum. Coarse-grained overbank deposits along anastomosing river channels contain more sand relative to those associated with meandering river systems. Finally, we found that coarse-grained overbank deposits {{have a positive effect on}} reservoir volumes and connectedness ratios. This study shows that the ubiquity of organics and the lakes that are associated with peat-forming wetlands have had a great influence on fluvial processes and thereby affected facies composition and architecture of fluvial deposits in distal delta plain...|$|R
40|$|Summary Construction on peat soils {{has proven}} to be a {{challenging}} task to civil engineers as this soil type is highly compressible. Especially in densely populated delta area’s as the Rijn or the Maas delta in the western of the Netherlands infrastructure needs to be constructed on soft non-bearing soil layers. Construction on soft soils like peat is frequently accompanied by high geotechnical risks and costs. In conclusion, a peat layer is often unsuitable to use as a founding material. Conventional stabilization techniques have several disadvantages, among which is a strong reduction in the water storage capacity of the peat layer. A novel stabilization method was proposed, which takes infiltration and reactive transport as the starting point. The goal was to strengthen the soil matrix without a significant loss of porosity. The aim was to create a silicate coating which encloses or at least connects the peat fibres, hereafter referred to as fibre encapsulation. It was proposed that encapsulation of the fibre alters the mechanical and chemical bulk properties of a peat layer. Stabilization should have been achieved by infiltration and transport of the reactive components (in-situ process). Transport distances well over 1 meter and low injection pressures increased the efficiency of the stabilization technique and thereby its applicability. The starting point for this research project was the patent “Soil Strengthening Composition” (Zon, 2007). This patent introduces an in-situ treatment method to strengthen the solid matrix of a peat soil. However, several steps in the patented technique are not feasible when applied in the field. Hence, optimization of the patented treatment method and evaluation of its feasibility under continuous flow conditions was necessary. The most critical aspects of the patented method, which were the subjects of optimization, are enumerated below. First of all, a highly concentrated source of silica was required that could function as injection fluid in a peat soil. A high silica load would reduce the number of flushes needed to stabilize a certain bulk volume. However, a distinctive characteristic of a peat soil is acidic to neutral pH conditions. The presence of silica in solution is restricted to concentrations less than 100 mg Si per liter in the pH range of 2 to 9. 5 at soil temperature. To increase the efficiency of the treatment method the load of silica in the injection fluid had to be elevated well above the solubility product of amorphous silica. Therefore the phase transition of silica, from dissolved to solid form, needed to be inhibited or at least delayed. The biopolymer Celquat L 200 was added to retard the polymerization process of silica and the subsequent growth of silica particles. Silica and the biopolymer were thereby the reactive components of the injection fluid. Secondly, a hardened layer of amorphous silica had to encapsulate the peat fibre. Mass transfer of silica from the pore fluid to fibre surface was therefore needed. Preservation of porosity was the aim. Hydraulic conductivity and water storage capacity of the layer had to be retained. Thirdly, infiltration was the method of choice to transport and place the reactive components. The horizontal hydraulic conductivity of a peat layer had to be 10 - 6 to 10 - 7 m/s or higher to obtain significant transport distances in one week. This was a crucial aspect to develop a promising in-situ stabilization technique. Objective and research questions The general objective was stabilization of peat through the formation of a silica based coating supplied by infiltration of the reactants. To reach the general objective, the critical aspects of the stabilization method as patented by Van der Zon (2007) were studied separately. The research parts concerned: (I) retardation of silica polymerization and silica particle growth, (II) attachment of silica to peat solids, and (III) infiltration of injection fluid trough peat. The related research questions are shortly described below. Retardation of silica polymerization and silica particle growth The injection fluid had to be a highly concentrated source of silicon at neutral to acid pH conditions. It was proposed that the concentration of dissolved and dispersed colloidal silica in the injection fluid could be elevated by the addition of the biopolymer Celquat L 200. The following questions were formulated: -	Does the biopolymer retard the polymerization process silica and the growth of silica particles? And what is the optimum composition of the injection fluid in terms of initial silica and biopolymer concentration? -	What is the impact of dissolved and particulate organic matter on the efficiency of the biopolymer to retard silica polymerization and to retard silica particle growth? -	What is the impact of the biopolymer on the zeta potential, as measure for the surface charge of a particle? Attachment of silica to peat fibre surface Attachment of silica to peat solids had to be obtained to improve the mechanical properties of the bulk material. However, repulsion between fibre surface and silica species in pore water was likely to oppose attachment of silica to fibre surface. In neutral to acid pH conditions, the surface charge of peat is negative. The surface charge of dissolved or colloidal silica is neutral to negative at pH values lower than 9. 5. Equal charged surfaces result into repulsion. The proposed solution was again the use of cationic biopolymer Celquat L 200 to initiate attachment between peat fibre and silica. The following research questions were formulated: -	Does the biopolymer Celquat L 200 initiate silica attachment to peat solids? And what is the optimum initial concentration of silica in the injection fluid to maximize attachment? Infiltration of injection fluid in peat To achieve transport distances well over one meter of the reactive components through peat three conditions need to be met. The following research questions were formulated: -	Is the hydraulic conductivity of the peat material high enough to allow reasonable horizontal flow velocities with a limited pressure gradient (at least 10 - 6 to 10 - 7 m/sec) ? -	Is the volume fraction of pores that conducts flow in peat large enough to allow sufficient stabilization of the bulk volume? -	What is the impact of infiltration of the reactive fluid on hydraulic conductivity of peat? Do the reactive components, silica and biopolymer, attach and precipitate preferably on the peat fibres, and not in the pore space where precipitation could lead complete clogging? Experimental Methods The feasibility of the proposed stabilization technique was determined based on laboratory research. To answer the specific research questions, three laboratory experiments were performed. A batch experiment was performed to research the design of the injection fluid (Retardation of silica…). A batch experiment in the presence of peat was performed to research attachment of silica to peat (Attachment of silica…). At last, an infiltration experiment was performed to investigate the transport of the reactive components and to evaluate the effect of injection on the porosity of a peat column (Infiltration of injection fluid…). Peat material as used in the Attachment and Infiltration experiments originated from Bellingwedde. The infiltration test an extra type of peat was tested that originated from location close to Zegveld. Peat from Bellingwedde was a reed-sedge bog peat. Peat from Zegveld was a fen <b>peat</b> classified as <b>sedge</b> type of <b>peat.</b> The materials and methods used to answer the research questions, as formulated for the three separate research parts, are shortly described in this section. Retardation of silica polymerization and silica particle growth The polymerization and aggregation of silica was monitored in the presence of the biopolymer Celquat L 200. Flasks were prepared with an initial silica concentration of 100, 300, 600 or 1250 ppm SiO 2 using sodium metasilicate as the source of silicon. These flasks contained a biopolymer to silica weight ratio of 1 to 1, 0. 5 to 1 or 0. 1 to 1. The polymerization reactions were induced by neutralizing the super saturated alkaline silica solution (from pH > 12 to 7. 5) and monitored by the time-dependent depletion of dissolved silica and time-dependent particle formation and growth. The experiment was completed 113 hours after pH adjustment. Attachment of silica to peat fibre surface The attachment efficiency of silica to peat solids was determined at initial concentrations of 60, 100, 300, 600 and 1250 ppm as SiO 2; and a biopolymer to silicate wt. ratio of 1. The distribution of silica and biopolymer between the liquid and the solid phase in presence of peat was the subject of research. The amount of silicate and biopolymer in the solid phase was calculated from the difference between the initial dissolved concentration before adjustment of pH and the final dissolved concentration after exposure to peat. The starting point of the attachment test was the moment the pH was adjusted to 7. 5. The dissolved concentration of silica and biopolymer were measured after 65 hours and 113 hours of incubation. Infiltration of injection fluid in peat To derive the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of Bellingwedde and Zegveld peat a constant head test was performed. By in line electrical conductivity measurements and analyses of effluent composition at specific time intervals breakthrough curves of tracer infiltration and elution were constructed. Five peat columns were treated. Injection and elution of sodium chloride solution (0. 09 and 0. 07 M) was performed. Injection and elution of saturated silica solution (217. 5 and 199. 5 ppm SiO 2) was performed; followed by the injection and partial elution of reactive colloidal suspensions (1247 ppm and 705 ppm SiO 2 / ppm L 200). And the fifth column was infiltrated with a biopolymer solution of 1962 ppm L 200. Conclusions The conclusions drawn per research part are described below. These conclusions are directly related to the results of the experimental tests. In the next section the implication of these conclusions for the feasibility of in-situ stabilization of peat soil by infiltration of reactants, is given. Retardation of silica polymerization and silica particle growth The biopolymer Celquat L 200 does effectively retard the polymerization process of silica. Dissolved silica concentrations of 300 to 400 ppm SiO 2 were achieved. The efficiency in which the biopolymer retards the polymerization of silica does not depend on initial silica concentration and biopolymer dosage. The biopolymer Celquat L 200 does effectively retard the growth of silica particles and this does depend on initial silica concentration and biopolymer dosage. Colloidal suspensions were formed during the 113 hours of incubation. Optimum composition of the injection fluid is obtained at initial silica concentration of 600 ppm SiO 2 and the 600 ppm biopolymer Celquat L 200. Attachment of silica to peat fibre surface The biopolymer Celquat L 200 effectively adsorbs to peat in the presence and absence of silica; 90 % to 99 % of the biopolymer initially added was removed from solution. Attachment of silica to peat solids in the presence of the biopolymer Celquat L 200 is effective; 79 % to 90 % of silica was removed from solution in the presence of the biopolymer Celquat L 200. Infiltration of injection fluid in peat It appeared not to be possible to obtain sufficient infiltration of the injection fluid in the peat columns (with permeabilities of 10 - 6 and 10 - 7 m/s). A hard transparent gel was observed at the inlet on the interface between the porous disc and the peat. Penetration of the gel was in the order of millimeters. It appeared that the attachment was too fast to get sufficient infiltration. This has to be researched further before the method can be used in the field. Implications for the Application Solely based on present results in-situ stabilization of peat is not feasible, though the performed research is far from complete. If significant transport distances of the reactants can be obtained in-situ stabilization of peat might be feasible. And significant transport distances might be achieved if the attachment of silica is delayed. It should however be noted, that the intrinsic hydrologic properties of a peat soil complicates infiltration of reactants – irrespective of the properties of the reactants. Given the relatively low hydraulic conductivity of peat, the small pore volume that actually conducts flow and the heterogeneity of the aspects on small and bulk scale, the question arises if the method could be efficient and under which conditions. That is, efficient in the period of infiltration needed and the bulk strength obtained within this period. In-situ stabilization would provide a solution for a niche of the construction-market on soft soils. The focus is at applications where time is not a constrain. Treatment could then be applied as long-term method; with the advantage of preservation of water storage capacity of the peat layer, and low burden to the surroundings, as opposed to the common applied long term method of preloading. A better assessment could be made if in-situ stabilization or even mixed in place stabilization technique is the method of choice for a specific type of peat; or if they are at all efficient methods to apply; in the case chemical and botanic characteristics of peat are known. This aspect should be acknowledged when aiming for optimization of the mechanical properties of peat – and therefore included in geotechnical research on behavior and stabilization of peat soils...|$|R
40|$|This thesis assesses {{aspects of}} the wetland development, {{permafrost}} dynamics and associated changes in carbon and nutrient cycling of the Stordalen Mire in northern Sweden. Various ecological and biogeochemical analyses of one peat and two lake sediment sequences were conducted, including analyses of organic matter and carbonate content, mosses, diatoms, testate amoebae, pigments, carbon and nitrogen and their stable isotopes, near infrared spectroscopy and biogenic silica. Results revealed that the structural development of the mire occurred during the later part of the Holocene. Peat inception was dated at 4700 cal BP and onset of organic sedimentation in two adjacent lake basins occurred at 3400 and 2650 cal BP. Fen peat accumulated until minimum 2800 cal BP, and after c. 2650 cal BP an early permafrost aggradation phase likely caused frost heave and {{significant changes in the}} wetland structure and hydrology. Peat is largely missing in the examined core between 2800 and 1350 cal BP, reflecting either environmental stress causing a decrease/cease of peat accumulation and/or erosion of previously formed peat. An increased content of redeposited peat in one of the lakes after c. 2100 cal BP, points to mire erosion caused by permafrost decay. A high nutrient/productivity layer in the other lake between 1900 and 1800 cal BP may have been related to the same event in the mire. <b>Sedge</b> <b>peat</b> accumulated from 1350 cal BP. Renewed permafrost aggradation is indicated indirectly around 700 cal BP and directly 120 cal BP from changes in peat building vegetation. Fen peat and transitions between dominating mire vegetation communities were characterized by frequent diatoms and high nutrient concentrations. Permafrost phases were associated with poor fen and bog formation, and thus considerably more acidic conditions in the mire as compared to pH conditions when richer fen communities dominated. This development resulted in more acidic runoff to adjacent lakes and affected carbonate precipitation there. Further, poor catchment retention of nutrients during poor fen/bog stages, probably caused increased fluxes of nutrients out of the system, stimulating primary lake productivity in adjacent lakes. Increased lake productivity in turn caused increased oxygen consumption for decomposition at the lake bottom, and thus anoxic conditions. Thereby an increased flux of phosphorous from the sediment triggered a state of self-sustained eutrophication during two centuries, preceding the onset of 20 th century permafrost thaw. Proxy indications of peat surface moisture conditions and lake-water TOC concentration dynamics during the last 100 years were reconstructed by means of testate amoebae assemblages in peat and near infrared spectroscopy and the carbon isotopic composition of lake sediment bulk organic matter. These results revealed a close connection with decadal trends of total annual and summer precipitation as well as single years with anomalously high precipitation, especially in the late summer. The data could thus not be directly linked to monitored trends in active layer thickness...|$|E
40|$|More {{than the}} half of the Netherlands is under {{the high level of}} sea and rivers. Therefore, {{evaluating}} the safety of dykes is primordial. A specific interest is given to peat dykes safety which suffer of a lack of knowledge which manifested recently by some peat dykes failures (Van Baars 2005). The behaviour of peat is also of interest in others countries, for assessing peat slope stability for instance (Long and Jennings 2006). Due to its high anisotropy and fibrosity, peat cannot be tested with any device in the laboratory. The direct simple shear test is routinely used since it can mimic several in situ conditions and provides conservative results for peat dyke stability evaluation. Furthermore, it does not show the inconvenience of triaxial testing with peat (Landva 1980). Larger samples than for usual testing are desirable to investigate the effect of fibres on tests results. The Direct simple shear testing devices remain imperfect since it is unable to provide additional shear stresses {{on the sides of the}} specimen. As consequence, non uniformities develop on all the faces of the specimen, in particular compression in the obtuse corners and tension in the acute corners. In practice, thin samples are used (height over diameter around 0, 2 to 0, 3) to limit the nonhomogeneities to the sides and leave the major part of the sample in an homogenous state of stress. Testing peat at low vertical stress, remains a challenge and necessities the development of adapted devices (Boylan and Long 2009). A series of tests has been performed on a wood and <b>sedge</b> <b>peat</b> with the Geonor device in order to compare the effect of two boundary conditions on tests results. The first one is a classical reinforced membrane (Bjerrum and Landva 1966) and the second is an unreinforced membrane enclosed in a stack of rings. The vertical stresses applied during the tests varied between 10 kPa and 120 kPa. The results show small differences when the Mohr Coulomb parameters are determined. The comparison is limited considering the variability of the material tested. A more accurate calibration of the stack of rings would be desirable. Some improvements are needed on the actual apparatus to test peat at low vertical stress. Removing the membrane between the soil and the rings would give more accuracy in the results. A direct simple shear prototype has been developed in order to test larger samples (with height over diameter ratio of 0. 5) at low vertical stress. The effect of two innovative rough boundaries on the stress-strain homogeneity of the sample has been investigated. The sidewalls of the device are transparent and make possible a visual assessment of the deformation of the sample. The Particle Image Velocimetry analysis is also considered to assess the shear strain homogeneity in the sample. The results show an improving shear strain homogeneity and reduced tension forces in the acute corners. Slippage is also observed between the top cap and the sample and the normal load could not be measured. Further research is needed to validate the utility of this prototype. Stress-strain curves obtained from the three boundaries should be compared to quantify the improvement of rough boundaries. A finite element analysis of the prototype boundaries has been performed with two models (Mohr Coulomb and Soft Soil Creep model). The boundaries considered were perfectly rough at the top and bottom and perfectly smooth at the sides. The presence of strips and even more the presence of vanes increase the stress – strain homogeneity inside the sample with both models. Reliable stress – strain curves as measured in classical devices could not be obtained with such boundaries. Interfaces should be preferred to model more realistic conditions.

40|$|Vacuum {{harvested}} peatlands do {{not easily}} regain their hydrological function after peat production therefore restoration {{is required to}} create hydrological conditions appropriate {{for the growth of}} peat producing fen plant species. Peat extraction at Bic-Saint-Fabien peatland by the block-cut method began in 1946, converted to vacuum harvesting in the early 1970 ’s and ceased in 2000. After exploitation, about 0. 04 - 1 m of residual minerotrophic <b>sedge</b> <b>peat</b> remained; therefore Bic-Saint-Fabien was restored as a fen. Research occurred in 2008 - 2011 and restoration began fall 2009 so we have two pre-restoration and two post-restoration study years. Rewetting consisted of blocking active drainage ditches, contouring the peat surface into level terraces to even out elevation differences, and building peat ridges (bunds) to retain runoff. Vegetation was introduced to some recontoured parts of the site by the surface layer transfer method. A straw mulch treatment was applied to minimize evapotranspiration. A water budget was created for the harvested cutover area and an adjacent undisturbed section of Bic-Saint- Fabien for all study years. Data collection for the water budget occurred June 2 -August 7 (day of year 153 - 219). Water table, volumetric soil moisture content and soil-water pressure were also examined to better understand the impact of reconfiguration on the hydrology of the system. A 1 - 1. 5 m thick layer of gyttja (a low permeability, high porosity lake-bed sediment) underlies the residual peat; it was parameterized and assessed to see if it could potentially compress and supply water to the overlying peat when the system is stressed. In 2011, the volumetric moisture content and thickness of gyttja were monitored in the field to estimate the strain placed on the gyttja by seasonal water table variability. Gyttja samples were collected and brought back to the laboratory for parameterization and compressibility tests. A water budget was completed annually for the cutover and undisturbed areas of the peatland. There were no distinguishable differences between study years except that 2008 and 2009 were climatologically wetter. During the water budget period surface and groundwater run-on into the cutover area were negligible making precipitation the principle water input. The dominant water loss from the cutover area was evapotranspiration since runoff was only 2 and 9 mm in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Rewetting did not result in a uniform wetness across the cutover site chiefly due to local differences in peat surface elevation. An interior section of Bic- Saint-Fabien remained saturated for nearly all of 2011; it had mean seasonal water table of + 2. 8 cm, and volumetric soil moisture content and soil-water pressure, 5 cm below the peat surface were 86 % and + 4 mbar. At a peripheral section (~ 100 m away) the values were - 14. 4 cm, 67 % and - 13 mbar, respectively. While the interior was generally wetter than the peripheral regions, there were some exceptions, notably near where dams were installed on peripheral drainage ditches. The markedly different spatial patterns of wetness suggests that a uniform prescription regarding vegetation re-establishment in the rewetted section may not be warranted. The bulk density, particle density and porosity of gyttja averaged 0. 12 g cm- 3 1. 57 g cm- 3 and 92 %, in the top 40 cm of the layer. The organic matter content of gyttja decreased with depth from about 70 % at a 5 cm depth to 45 % at a 45 cm depth. Laboratory compression tests showed 9 and 72 % strain at effective stresses of 3. 5 and 200 kPa, respectively, demonstrating the potential for releasing water upon compression, which in the field is caused by water table lowering. From day of year 192 to 202 in 2011, when a ~ 8 cm water level change occurred (effective stress range ~ 0. 8 kPa), the volumetric moisture content and thickness of the top 30 cm of gyttja decreased by 0. 4 %, and 0. 5 cm, respectively, representing 0. 1 and 1. 7 % strain, respectively, as determined from these two different approaches. The compression of gyttja after Bic-Saint-Fabien was rewetted (2011) was small but might have been significant under drier conditions with greater water table variability, such as during the early stages of site drainage when it was being prepared for peat extraction or after peat production ceased. The release of water to the peat layer from the compression of gyttja after peat production finished and before rewetting occurred, might have been an important self-preservation mechanism, eventually making it easier to rewet. Water table drawdown in 2011 produced very small strain rates suggesting gyttja compression in this year had no important role; hence rewetting success was more reliant on other rewetting techniques implemented at this site...|$|E
