Distraught after realizing that they are having sex and after everyone mocks him, Andy throws a tantrum, hurling a box of pizza at the wall and storming out of the conference room. Gabe takes Andy to his cubicle and admonishes him for his behavior, revealing he is aware why Andy hosted the sex ed class. He explains to Andy that the only reason he asked Erin out was because Andy gave his blessing, which Andy reveals was just a result of his difficulty <b>saying</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> how politely Gabe asked him. Gabe tells Andy {{that he is going to}} let this whole situation slide this time and advises Andy to put Erin behind him.|$|E
500|$|Microsoft's E3 {{press conference}} on June 10, 2013, was also criticized for {{focusing}} too much on games that, beyond increased graphical capabilities, provided experiences that were otherwise similar to previous-generation games—giving little incentive for buying the new console. After Sony's E3 press conference later that evening, GameSpot editor Tom Mcshea {{went on to say}} that Microsoft had become anti-consumerist, trying to [...] "punish their loyal customers" [...] with strict restrictions, and that [...] "by <b>saying</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> the used game restrictions and always-online that Microsoft is so happily implementing on the Xbox One, Sony has elevated the PlayStation 4 as the console to grab this holiday season."

2500|$|National {{public health}} goals for {{adolescents}} recommend providing a comprehensive sex education, which covers {{a wide array}} of topics and call for [...] "increasing the share of adolescents receiving formal instruction about abstinence, birth control methods, and prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs." [...] Despite the aims national public health goals, research has indicated a growing gap between them and adolescents receipt of sex education. [...] Data from the National Survey of Family Growth, a nationally-representative household survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, asked respondents if prior to age 18 they had ever received [...] "any formal instruction at a school, church, a community center or some other place" [...] about a range of sex education topics. [...] During the period 2011-2013, data from the NSFG showed that among adolescents aged 15–19, similar proportions of females and males reported receiving formal instruction, with the share receiving instruction about birth control methods (60% females, 55% males) lower than the share receiving instruction about <b>saying</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> sex, sexually transmitted diseases, or HIV/AIDS. [...] Many sexually experienced teens (43% females and 57% of males) do not receive formal instruction about contraception before they first have sex; the share of adolescents receiving formal instruction has been declining. Between 2006-2010 and 2011-2013, there were declines in the proportion of females ages 15–19 who reported receiving instruction on birth control, <b>saying</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> sex, HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, as well as a decline in the proportion of males who reported receiving formal instruction about birth control. [...] Both males and females reported an increase in receiving instruction on <b>saying</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> sex, without being provided information about birth control.|$|E

After appearing on the show for three years, James decided to quit and the character was killed off.

2500|$|In 2008, {{the band}} (now {{consisting}} of Easterbrook with Chas Wheeler and Marc Beard) {{set to work}} on a planned EP entitled 'Songs For Dead Blondes - POETS', but this instead became their 4th album. [...] "The Bones <b>Saying</b> <b>No</b> <b>to</b> the Needle" [...] was released as a one-sided 7" [...] single in June 2009 and the album, titled A Few Minutes in the Absolute Elsewhere, followed in February 2010 as a digital download and a lavishly packaged limited edition vinyl pressing. Easterbrook described it as a semi-concept album, with 'a loose narrative structure, and there are two different stories. I would say that side one is about a lad, side two is about a girl. In the last song, somehow, via the magic of cinema, the two characters come together, and there’s a…I wouldn’t say there’s redemption, but there is a conclusion to it.' Shindig! magazine rated it as their 'best album yet, covering several styles of post-punk-psyche in 34 minutes yet still sounding epic', while Classic Rock commented that 'their brevity is their strength. They fit a lot of ideas into their narrow framework and they've produced a diverting and offbeat record that stands pretty much alone in the current landscape.' Mojo noted a similarity to fellow Liverpudlians Shack, 'but they also add curious sonic details and lyrics of drug laments, romantic poets and death that relocate from Liverpool to Parisian cemeteries.' ...|$|E

2500|$|Since 2009, Yulin, Guangxi {{has held}} an annual festival of eating dog meat (purportedly {{a celebration of}} the summer solstice). In 2014, the {{municipal}} government published a statement that the festival is not a cultural tradition, but rather a commercial event held by restaurants and the public. Various dog meat dishes (and more recently, cats) are eaten, washed down by lychee wine. The festival in 2011 spanned 10 days, during which 15,000 dogs were consumed. Estimates of the number of dogs eaten during the festival range from 10,000- 15,000. Festival organizers claim that only dogs bred specifically for consumption are used, but others claim that some of the dogs purchased for slaughter and consumption are strays or stolen pets, as evidenced by their collars. Some of the dogs eaten at the festival are burnt or boiled alive and there are reports that the dogs are sometimes clubbed or beaten to death in the belief that the increased adrenaline circulating in the dog's body adds to the flavor of the meat. At the 2015 festival, there were long queues outside large (300-seat) eateries which sold the dog meat for around £4 (€5.60) per kilogram. Prior to the 2014 festival, eight dogs (and their two cages) sold for 1,150 yuan ($185) and six puppies for 1,200 yuan. Prior to the 2015 festival, a protester bought 100 dogs for 7,000 yuan ($1,100; £710). The animal rights NGO Best Volunteer Centre claims the city has more than 100 slaughterhouses, processing between 30 and 100 dogs a day. However, the Yulin Centre for Animal Disease Control and Prevention claims the city has only eight dog slaughterhouses selling approximately 200 dogs, although this increases to about 2,000 dogs during the Yulin festival. There are several campaigns to stop the festival; more than 3,000,000 people have signed petitions against it on Weibo (China’s equivalent of Twitter). One of the petitions, addressed to the Chinese Minister of Agriculture, Chen Wu, reads [...] "Do the humane thing by <b>saying</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> this festival and save the lives of countless dogs that will fall victim to this event – an event that will butcher, skin alive, beat to death etc. thousands of innocent dogs." [...] Prior to the 2014 festival, doctors and nurses staff were ordered not to eat dog meat there, and local restaurants serving dog meat were ordered to cover the word [...] "dog" [...] on their signs and notices.|$|E

6000|$|For {{the office}} of Irish {{secretary}} Mr. Gladstone selected Lord Frederick Cavendish, who was the husband of a niece of Mrs. Gladstone’s, {{and one of the}} most devoted of his friends and adherents. The special reason for the choice of this capable and high-minded man, was that Lord Frederick had framed a plan of finance at the treasury for a new scheme of land purchase. The two freshly appointed Irish ministers at once crossed over to a country seething in disorder. The (M27) afternoon of the fatal sixth of May was passed by the new viceroy and Lord Frederick in that grim apartment in Dublin Castle, where successive secretaries spend unshining hours in <b>saying</b> <b>No</b> <b>to</b> impossible demands, and hunting for plausible answers to insoluble riddles. Never did so dreadful a shadow overhang it as on that day. The task on which the two ministers were engaged was the consideration of the new provisions for coping with disorder, which had been prepared in London. The under-secretary, Mr. Burke, and one of the lawyers, were present. Lord Spencer rode out to the park about five o’clock, and Lord Frederick followed him an hour later. He was overtaken by the under-secretary walking homewards, and as the two strolled on together, they were both brutally murdered in front of the vice-regal residence. The assassins did not know who Lord Frederick was. Well has it been said that Ireland seems the sport of a destiny that is aimless.(43) ...|$|E

60|$|Marie was {{dissatisfied}} with her letter,--not because it described her father as 'cutting up rough.' To her {{who had known}} her father all her life that {{was a matter of}} course. But there was no word of love in the note. An impassioned correspondence carried on through Didon would be delightful to her. She was quite capable of loving, and she did love the young man. She had, no doubt, consented to accept the addresses of others whom she did not love,--but this she had done at the moment almost of her first introduction to the marvellous world in which she was now living. As days went on she ceased to be a child, and her courage grew within her. She became conscious of an identity of her own, which feeling was produced in great part by the contempt which accompanied her increasing familiarity with grand people and grand names and grand things. She was no longer afraid of <b>saying</b> <b>No</b> <b>to</b> the Nidderdales on account of any awe of them personally. It might be that she should acknowledge herself to be obliged to obey her father, though she was drifting away even from the sense of that obligation. Had her mind been as it was now when Lord Nidderdale first came to her, she might indeed have loved him, who, as a man, was infinitely better than Sir Felix, and who, had he thought it to be necessary, would have put some grace into his lovemaking. But at that time she had been childish. He, finding her to be a child, had hardly spoken to her. And she, child though she was, had resented such usage. But a few months in London had changed all this, and now she was a child no longer. She was in love with Sir Felix, and had told her love. Whatever difficulties there might be, she intended to be true. If necessary, she would run away. Sir Felix was her idol, and she abandoned herself to its worship. But she desired that her idol should be of flesh and blood, and not of wood. She was at first half-inclined to be angry; but as she sat with his letter in her hand, she remembered {{that he did not know}} Didon as well as she did, and that he might be afraid to trust his raptures to such custody. She could write to him at his club, and having no such fear, she could write warmly.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Gladstone now {{had this}} fatal law of mundane things {{brought home to}} him. As time went on, he by rapid intuition gained a truer insight into the leading facts. He {{realised}} that Mahometan institutions in the Ottoman empire were decrepit; that the youthful and vigorous elements in European Turkey were crushed under antiquated and worn-out forms and forces unfit for rule. He awoke to the disquieting reflection how the occupation of the Principalities had been discussed, day after day and month after month, entirely as {{a question of the}} payment of forty thousand pounds a year to Turkey, or as a violation of her rights as suzerain, but never in reference to the well-being, happiness, freedom, or peace of the inhabitants. He still held that the war in its origin was just, for it had been absolutely necessary, he said, to cut the meshes of the net in which Russia had entangled Turkey. He persisted in condemning the whole tone and policy of Russia in 1854. By the end of 1854, in Mr. Gladstone's eyes, this aggressive spirit had been extinguished, the Czar promising an almost unreserved acceptance of the very points that he had in the previous August angrily rejected. The essential objects of the war were the abolition of Russian rights in the Principalities, and the destruction of Russian claims upon Greek Christians under Ottoman sway. These objects, Mr. Gladstone insisted, were attained in January 1855, when Russia agreed to three out of the Four Points--so the bases of agreement were named--and only demurred upon the plan for carrying out a portion of the fourth. The special object was to cancel the preponderance of Russia in the Black Sea. No fewer than seven different plans were simultaneously or in turn propounded. They were every one of them admitted to be dubious, inefficient, and imperfect. I will spare the reader the mysteries of limitation, of counterpoise, of counterpoise and limitation mixed. Russia preferred counterpoise, the allies were for limitation. Was this preference between two degrees of the imperfect, the deficient, and the ineffective a good ground for prolonging a war that was costing the allies a hundred million pounds a year, and involved to all the parties concerned the loss of a thousand lives a day? Yet, for <b>saying</b> <b>No</b> <b>to</b> this question, Mr. Gladstone was called a traitor, even by men who in 1853 had been willing to content themselves with the Vienna note, and in 1854 had been anxious to make peace {{on the basis of the}} Four Points. In face of pleas so wretched for a prolongation of a war to which he had assented on other grounds, was he bound to silence? 'Would it not, on the contrary,' he exclaimed, 'have been the most contemptible effeminacy of character, if a man in my position, who feels that he has been instrumental in bringing his country into this struggle, were to hesitate a single moment when he was firmly convinced in his own mind that the time had arrived when we might with honour escape from it?' ...|$|E
