30|$|Three rare {{occasions}} are introduced, where the excitation of vertical acoustic resonance between {{the ground and}} the ionosphere, and the resultant generation of a field-aligned current, just after earthquakes are observationally confirmed. In the case of two inland earthquakes, barometric observations very close to the epicenters (i.e., only 30 km apart) were available, and they showed a <b>sharp</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>peak</b> which appeared within one hour after the origin time and lasted a few hours. The observed periods of the spectral peaks around 260 seconds are close to the period of the theoretically-expected fundamental mode of the resonance. On the other hand, magnetic observations on the ground showed a dominant period at 220 – 230 seconds which corresponds to the first overtone among theoretically-expected major resonance peaks. In the third case, i.e., during the 2010 Chile earthquake, a long-period magnetic oscillation in the east-west direction, which has two major resonance periods at 265 and 190 – 195 seconds, was observed on the night-side magnetic dip equator in Peru, where the distance is more than 2600 km from the epicenter, under a very quiet geomagnetic condition. The oscillation was interpreted as the effect of field-aligned current generated through a dynamo process in the ionosphere over the epicenter caused by the resonance.|$|E

Motions in an infinite 2 -layer model ocean {{are treated as}} a system of weakly nonlinear Rossby waves (weak geostrophic turbulence). The {{evolution of}} the energy spectrum of the barotropic and the baroclinic modes is investigated {{on the basis of}} numerical experiments with the kinetic equation for baroclinic Rossby waves. The basic features of free (nonforced inviscid) spectral evolution of baroclinic flows {{are similar to those of}} the barotropic motions. A portion of the energy is transferred to a <b>sharp</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>peak</b> while the rest of it is isotropically distributed. The peak corresponds to an intensive nearly zonal barotropic flow. Typically, this well-defined barotropic zonal anisotropy inhibits the reinforcement of its baroclinic analogy. For a certain set of initial conditions (in particular, if the barotropic zonal flow is not present initially), a zonal anisotropy of both modes is generated. The interplay between the multimodal nearly zonal flow components leads to the excitation of large-scale (several times exceeding the scale of the initial state), mostly meridional, baroclinic motions at the expense of the barotropic nearly zonal flow. The underlying mechanism is explained on the level of elementary mixed-triad interaction. The whole wave field retains its essentially baroclinic as well as spectrally broad nature. It evidently tends towards a thermodynamically equilibrated final state, consisting of the superposition of a (usually barotropic, but occasionally multimodal) zonal flow and a wave system with a Raleigh-Jeans spectrum. This evolution takes place as a multi-staged process, with fast convergence of the modal spectra to a local equilibrium followed by a more gradual adjustment of the energy balance between the modes...|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to clarify what drives the ionospheric dynamo from the lower atmosphere and why the seasonal dependence of the amplitude shows the topographical characteristics as shown in Figure  10. We consider {{the effect of the}} upward propagating atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs), i.e., the acoustic gravity waves and the internal gravity waves, from the lower atmosphere to the ionosphere. Some reports confirm the propagation of the atmospheric gravity waves from the troposphere to the ionosphere by computer simulation (e.g., Horinouchi et al. 2002; Walterscheid et al. 2003). As to a possibility that magnetic fluctuations are caused by the AGWs, after the Sumatra earthquake on 26 December 2004, Iyemori et al. (2005) observed a peculiar geomagnetic pulsation near the conjugate point of the epicenter of the earthquake. The period of a <b>sharp</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>peak</b> was 3.6  min, near one of the vertical resonance periods of the acoustic gravity wave between the ground and the ionosphere predicted by several papers (e.g., Tahira 1995). Iyemori et al. (2005) suggested the following process to generate the magnetic pulsation. First, the ocean floor suddenly moves vertically up (or down) and is accompanied by neutral atmosphere movement there. The acoustic wave which propagates vertically to the lower ionosphere is reflected back at an altitude where the wave frequency is equal to the cutoff frequency. If the condition matches, the vertical acoustic resonance occurs. At last, the dynamo generates the long-period magnetic pulsations. Iyemori et al. (2013) analyzed the barometric data as well as the observed magnetic field on the ground after the 2008 Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku earthquake, 2007 Mieken-Chubu earthquake, and 2010 Chile earthquake and found the sharp spectral peaks at the acoustic resonance periods in each event, which strongly supports the above suggestion.|$|E

A system designer can use a spread-spectrum PLL to reduce interference with high-Q receivers by spreading the energy over a larger portion of the spectrum. For example, by changing the operating frequency up and down by a small amount (about 1%), a device running at hundreds of megahertz can spread its interference evenly over a few megahertz of spectrum, which drastically reduces the amount of noise seen on broadcast FM radio channels, which have a bandwidth of several tens of kilohertz.|$|R

We show that in general a spectral structure with a narrow width appears in two scenarios: I) "Spectrum broadening" for the continuous sources with a delta-function-like injection spectrum. In this scenario, a finite width can develop after propagation through the Galaxy, which can reveal {{the distance of the}} source. Well-motivated sources include mini-spikes and subhalos formed by dark matter (DM) particles χ_s which annihilate directly into e+e- pairs. II) "Phase-space shrinking" for burst-like sources with a power-law-like injection spectrum. The spectrum after propagation can shrink at a cooling-related cutoff energy and form a <b>sharp</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>peak.</b> The peak can be more prominent due to the energy-dependent diffusion. In this scenario, the width of the excess constrains both the power index and the distance of the source. Possible such sources are pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs). We analysis the DAMPE excess and find that the continuous DM sources should be fairly close within 0. 3 kpc, and the annihilation cross sections are close to the thermal value. For the burst-like source, the narrow width of the excess suggests that the injection spectrum must be hard with power index significantly less than two, the distance is within (3 - 4) kpc, and the age of the source is 0. 16 Myr. In both scenarios, large anisotropies in the CRE flux are predicted. We identify possible candidates of mini-spike (PWN) sources in the current Fermi-LAT 3 FGL (ATNF) catalog. The diffuse gamma-rays from these sources can be well below the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray backgrounds and less constrained by the Ferm-LAT data, if they are located at the low Galactic latitude regions.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades several paleoceanographic studies found {{evidence}} for millennial scale climate variability {{during the late}} Pleistocene. While these climate fluctuations are well studied in the North Atlantic, the paleoceanographic history in the North Pacific is less well known. The last glacial termination is of special interest, as it represents the most recent transition from glacial to deglacoal conditions. In the North Pacific these changes led to a strengthening of the mid-depth oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) to anoxic bottom water conditions and the deposition of laminated sediments. The main objective of this thesis was to gain {{new insights into the}} deglacial mid-depth OMZ dynamics in the Bering Sea, using a suite of mid-depth, partly laminated sediment cores that were collected during R/V Sonne cruise SO 202 -INOPEX. It will be shown that during the Bølling–Allerød (BA) and early Holocene the Bering Sea OMZ strengthened to anoxic values of 2100 m. Based on a correlation of 14 C-dated, laminated sediment cores it is revealed that throughout the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska the onset of deglacial anoxia at 14. 6 ka and 11. 7 ka was a synchronous event, while the disappearance of laminations was a diachronous process. A decadal-scale correlation of two 14 C dated, layer counted sediment cores with seasonal resolution from the northeastern Bering Sea slope to the NGRIP δ 18 O record revealed, that (1) the formation of laminations was tightly coupled to warm phases of the B/A and the early Holocene, which implies an atmospheric teleconnection between the North Atlantic and Bering Sea, and (2) the presence of annually laminated sediments (varves). The established age model was partly independent from radiocarbon ages and allowed the calculation of surface reservoir ages, which are 770 yr, 910 yr and 875 yr for the Holocene, Younger Dryas and B/A respectively. The anoxia were driven on millennial scales by basin-wide remineralization of organic matter in intermediate waters, in combination with decadal-scale export productivity increases during times of warm temperatures. Based on a stacked sea surface temperature (SST) record, SSTs of about 6 °C persisted during times of lamina formations, while SSTs showed values of about 5 °C during times were laminations were not widespread. Other factors that enhanced the export productivity during the B/A and Holocene were increased stratification, a change towards seasonal sea ice, and an input of nutrients and organic carbon from the Alaska hinterlands, which started at 16. 6 ka in the Bering Sea. Spectral analyses of Xray-fluorescense-based Cl values of single laminae, which were used as a indicator for biosiliceous productivity, revealed a <b>sharp</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>peak</b> of 18. 8 yr and a broader peak of 30 – 60 yr in the B/A and early Holocene. The first peak was related to the 18. 6 yr nodal tidal cycle and the latter peak to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. They influenced primary productivity through nutrient delivery to the surface via tidal mixing, SST variations and stratification. Both processes act in the modern subarctic Pacific, which suggests that productivity variations in the subarctic Pacific are consistently influenced by a combination of external and internal forcing mechanisms since the last deglacial...|$|E

The understanding of these seismovolcanic phenomena requires good descriptions of the distribution in time and frequency of the different spectral components included in the signals, {{as well as a}} separation of the resonance effects from less energetic effects such as excitation and propagation. We address the issue of extracting from individual records information as detailed as possible on the physical processes involved at the source. We introduce and compare several time-frequency analysis methods, and we describe the application of autoregressive modeling and deconvolution methods to the characterization and separation of the main spectral components. We propose a signal analysis approach based on the joint use of a set of complementary methods, and we present applications to several examples of volcanic tremor and LP events. The time-frequency analysis of some of the LP events taken as examples reveals short-duration components at the seismogram onsets with energy concentrated at frequencies either higher or lower than the main resonance frequencies. These seismic phases are probably related to the excitation processes of the volcanic resonators. In several cases, the arrival of the main <b>spectral</b> <b>peak</b> has a delay of a few tenths of a second with respect to the first arrival.

40|$|Purpose : Surface {{electromyography}} (EMG) {{has been}} widely used to measure neuromuscular activity during vibration exercise (VE) to investigate the underlying mechanisms elicited by VE. However, the EMG spectrum recorded during VE shows sharp peaks at the vibration frequency whose interpretation remains controversial. Some authors considered those peaks {{as a result of}} motion artifacts, while others interpreted them as due to vibration-induced neuromuscular activity. The aim of the present study is to clarify the nature of those sharp peaks observed during VE. Methods : Three independent EMG measurements were performed during VE: in vitro (IVT), in vivo at rest (IVV R), and in vivo during voluntary contraction (IVV C). The amplitudes of the EMG vibration frequency components (A VF) were extracted for all measurements. The conduction velocity (CV) of the vibration frequency components and the full EMG spectrum were also estimated during voluntary contraction. Results : Our spectrum analysis revealed small A VF for IVT and IVV R, accounting for only 3. 3 and 7. 6 % of that obtained from IVV C. Moreover, the CV estimation indicated the EMG vibration components to propagate along the muscle fiber with CV ˜ 6. 5 m/s, comparable to the CV estimated using the full EMG spectrum (5. 7 m/s).

In this paper, we propose a processing procedure based on Continuous Wavelet Transform of multichannel, broad-band data to simultaneously solve the signal detection and location problems. Our method consists of two steps. First, we apply a frequency-dependent threshold to the estimates of the array-averaged WCO in order to locate the time-frequency regions spanned by coherent arrivals. For these data, we then use the time-series of the complex wavelet coefficients for deriving the elements of the spatial Cross- Spectral Matrix. From the eigenstructure of this matrix, we eventually estimate the kinematic signals’ parameters using the MUltiple SIgnal Characterization (MUSIC) algorithm. The whole procedure greatly facilitates the detection and location of weak, broad-band signals, in turn avoiding the time-frequency resolution trade-off and frequency leakage effects which affect conventional covariance estimates based uponWindowed Fourier Transform. The method is applied to explosion signals recorded at Stromboli volcano by either a short-period, small aperture antenna, or a large-aperture, broad-band network. The LP (0. 2 2 s) of the explosion recordings from the broad-band network. Source locations obtained this way are fully compatible with those retrieved from application of more traditional (and computationally expensive) time-domain techniques, such as the Radial Semblance method...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} of the optical properties of GaN nanostructured light emitting diode (LED) arrays are presented. Microphotoluminescence spectroscopy with pulsed and continuous wave lasers was used to probe the carrier dynamics and emission mechanisms of nanorod LED arrays fabricated by a top down etching method. Results show a possible reduction in internal electric field as nanorod diameter decreases. Localisation effects were also observed, affecting the spectral shape of the nanorod emission. Under two-photon excitation, quantum dot-like <b>sharp</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>peaks</b> in the PL spectra are found to exist in abundance amongst all the nanorod samples. The optical properties of these localised states, which are shown {{to be associated with}} the nanorod free-surfaces, are characterised using non-linear and time resolved spectroscopy. An investigation into spatially resolved single nanorods was also carried out. Single nanorods were isolated, and characterised using pulsed lasers. The etching is shown to increase the carrier decay life-time at extended intervals over several hundred ns. The temporal evolution and excitation power density dependence of the quantum dot-like states are also presented for the first time. The long lived localised states are thought to arise from surface effects, in particular Fermi-surface pinning, causing localisation and spatial separation of carriers. Additional work on nano-pyramid array LEDs, with quantum wells on semi-polar surfaces is also presented. Optical properties using micro-photoluminescence are compared to cathodoluminescence studies. An uneven distribution of emission wavelengths across the pyramid facet is thought to lead to an emission mechanism involving carriers transferring between multiple spatially localised states. Finally, experimental techniques and fabrication methods for future work are documented in detail. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{was focused}} on {{theoretical}} models of synchronization to cortical dynamics as measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG). Dynamical systems theory was used in both identifying relevant variables for brain coordination and also in devising methods for their quantification. We presented a method for studying interactions of linear and chaotic neuronal sources using MEG beamforming techniques. We showed that such sources can be accurately reconstructed {{in terms of their}} location, temporal dynamics and possible interactions. Synchronization in low-dimensional nonlinear systems was studied to explore specific correlates of functional integration and segregation. In the case of interacting dissimilar systems, relevant coordination phenomena involved generalized and phase synchronization, which were often intermittent. Spatially-extended systems were then studied. For locally-coupled dissimilar systems, {{as in the case of}} cortical columns, clustering behaviour occurred. Synchronized clusters emerged at different frequencies and their boundaries were marked through oscillation death. The macroscopic mean field revealed <b>sharp</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>peaks</b> at the frequencies of the clusters and broader spectral drops at their boundaries. These results question existing models of Event Related Synchronization and Desynchronization. We re-examined the concept of the steady-state evoked response following an AM stimulus. We showed that very little variability in the AM following response could be accounted by system noise. We presented a methodology for detecting local and global nonlinear interactions from MEG data in order to account for residual variability. We found crosshemispheric nonlinear interactions of ongoing cortical rhythms concurrent with the stimulus and interactions of these rhythms with the following AM responses. Finally, we hypothesized that holistic spatial stimuli would be accompanied by the emergence of clusters in primary visual cortex resulting in frequency-specific MEG oscillations. Indeed, we found different frequency distributions in induced gamma oscillations for different spatial stimuli, which was suggestive of temporal coding of these spatial stimuli.

40|$|Under noisy conditions, {{due to the}} {{redundancy}} {{of speech}} signal, there are some spectral bands (Reliable Bands) whose local SNR’s are high enough to be used effectively by a recognizer. Based on this, a novel, phonetically motivated Reliable Bands Guided sim-ilarity measure (RBG measure) is proposed. It has the following features. Firstly, for reference spectrum, frequency bands which have larger absolute energy or <b>sharper</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>peaks</b> are marked as reliable bands. They are to be given more weight than the other bands {{in the definition of}} the RBG measure. Secondly, within each reliable band, similarity between formant positions and formant shapes of test spectrum and reference spectrum is explicitly mod-eled. Lastly, the measure can automatically emphasize spectral bands whose amplitudes change abruptly, which normally contain more reliable dynamic features of the speech signal. Both the RBG measure and the PMC method are tested on a speaker-independent, continuous Mandarin digit string recognition task, under 15 noisy conditions. Noises are drawn from the NOISEX 92 database. The RBG measure shows an average 4. 22 % word accuracy score below the PMC method above 0 dB. However, it outperforms the PMC method by 8. 82 % at 0 dB. More importantly, the RBG measure does not rely on accurate end-point detection and accurate mod-eling of the background noise, which are difficult tasks in them-selves. To further improve the performance of the RBG measure, we dis-cuss the possibility of integrating the findings in the Computational Auditory Scene Analysis (CASA) field into the current system. First, we reviewed the theory of Auditory Scene Analysis, which was originally established by Bregman in 1990. We then discuss some computational models which were proposed for separating input sounds mixture into different sound streams. Finally we con-sider the possibility of integrating such models into the RBG mea-sure...|$|R
40|$|We study a "strongly-coupled" (SC) {{polariton}} system formed {{between the}} atom-like intersubband transitions in a semiconductor nanostructure and the THz optical modes that are localised {{at the edges}} of a gold aperture. The polaritons can be excited optically, by incoherent excitation with bandgap radiation, and we find that they also coherently scatter the same input laser, to give strikingly <b>sharp</b> "sideband" (SB) <b>spectral</b> <b>peaks</b> in the backscattered spectrum. The SB intensity is a sensitive track of the polariton density and they can be detected down to a quantum noise floor that is more than 2500 times lower than the excitation thresholds of comparable quantum cascade laser diodes.

40|$|Laser-Compton {{scattering}} (LCS) {{experiments were}} carried out at the Idaho Accelerator Center (IAC). Sharp monochromatic X-ray lines were observed which result from {{the interaction of the}} electron beam with the laser optical photons. The back-scattered photons are kinematically boosted to keV X-ray energies. The X-rays were generated by colliding a 20 - 22 MeV, 5 - 20 ns electron beam with a 100 MW, 7 ns Nd:YAG laser. We observed low background, <b>sharp</b> LCS X-ray <b>spectral</b> <b>peaks</b> resulting from the interaction of the electron beam with the Nd:YAG laser fundamental and second harmonic lines (1064 and 532 nm). The LCS X-ray energy lines and energy deviations were measured {{as a function of the}} electron beam energy and energy-spread respectively. The experimental results showed good agreement with the predicted values. Because LCS X-rays are monochromatic, with energies that are easily tunable, have the same polarization as the laser, and the same time structure as that of the electron beam, LCS could be used as a unique X-ray source with a broad range of applications...|$|R
