The auxiliary equipment of an engine is typically not serviced by this loop; for instance, an alternator may use ball bearings sealed with their own lubricant. The reservoir for the oil is usually the sump, and when this is the case, it is called a wet sump system. When there is a different oil reservoir the crankcase still catches it, but it is continuously drained by a dedicated pump; {{this is called a}} dry sump system.|$|E

However, {{there is an}} increasing concern with the flooded <b>lubrication</b> <b>systems</b> due to their biological and envi-ronmental impact {{as well as their}} maintenance and disposal cost. Polymer-based material, a sponge-like solid lubricant allowing the oil to weep out while in use, provides a promising alternative environ-mentally benign lubrication solution to satisfy the lubrication requirements for some manufacturing processes. In addition, it can minimize contamination of the coolant system, reduce waste processing and disposal costs, and alleviate the in-plant safety hazard from oil leakage on floor surfaces.

40|$|Millions {{of hybrid}} cars are already running on our roads {{with the purpose}} of {{reducing}} fossil fuel dependence. One of their main advantages is the recovery of wasted energy, namely by brake recovery. However, there are other sources of wasted energy in a car powered by an internal combustion engine, such as the heat lost through the cooling <b>system,</b> <b>lubrication</b> system (oil coolers) and in the exhaust system. These energies can be recuperated by the use of thermoelectric generators (TEG) based on the Seebeck effect, which transform heat directly into electricity To recover the energy from the hot (up to more than 700 ºC) exhaust gases it is possible to use controlled heat transfer, but this would limit the heat transfer potential at partial loads, as commercialy available TEG are limited by their maximum allowable temperature (~ 250 ºC). Therefore Heat Pipes were used as an alternative heat transfer mean, so {{it would be possible to}} retain the heat transfer potential, while controlling the maximum temperature at a reasonable level. This is the method to recover the exhaust heat presented in this work. Numerical simulations were performed to assess the potential for this design, involving internal combustion engine simulation, thermoelectric generators simulation and heat transfer modelling. Additionally, the use of variable conductance heat pipes (VCHP) is discussed, as a means of achieving TEG module maximum temperature limitation.

40|$|The {{premature}} {{failure of a}} large agglomeration machine used for the annual production of 360, 000 m(3) of eucalypt fiber panels was investigated to identify the nucleation and growth mechanisms of cracking in PH stainless steel belts (126 m x 2. 9 m x 3. 0 mm). These belts are used to compress a cushion composed of eucalyptus fibers and glue, being the pressure transmitted from the pistons {{by the action of}} numerous case-hardening steel rolls. Examination of the belt working interfaces (belt/rolls and belt/eucalypt fibers) indicated that the main cracking was nucleated on the belt/roll interface {{and that there is a}} clear relationship between the crack nucleation and the presence of superficial irregularities, which were observed on the belt/roll working surface. Used rolls showed the presence of perimetric wear marks and 2 mu m silicon-rich encrusted particles (identified as silicon carbide). Lubricant residues contained the presence of helicoidal wires, which were originated by the release of the stainless steel cleaning brush bristles, and 15 mu m diameter metallic particles, which were generated by material detachment of the belt. The presence of foreign particles on the tribological interface contributed to an increase of the shear stresses at the surfaces and, consequently, the number of the contact fatigue crack nucleation sites in the belt/roll tribo-interface. The cracking was originated on the belt/roll interface of the stainless steel belt by a mixed rolling/slip contact fatigue mechanism, which promoted spalling and further nucleation and growth of conventional fatigue cracks. Finally, the <b>system</b> <b>lubrication</b> efficiency and the cleaning procedure should be optimised in order to increase the life expectancy of the belt. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|In all gliding {{bearings}} wear is {{an issue}} of concern, as well as lubrication. Conventional gliding yaw bearings incorporate gliding elements manufactured out of polymer plastics such as POM or PA. To reduce friction, wear, and avoid stick-slip effects (often present in such high friction slow moving <b>systems),</b> <b>lubrication</b> is often introduced. This solution generally solves the gliding issues, but introduces more components to the systems and increases the general complication (e.g., difficult maintenance procedures for removal of used lubricant). Some wind turbine manufacturers now use self lubricating gliding elements instead of a central <b>lubrication</b> <b>system.</b> These gliding elements are manufactured from low friction materials or composites (e.t.g Teflon) that allow reliable operation of dry (non-lubricated) gliding yaw systems.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 71 - 75) "May 2006. "The {{bleed air}} system in an aircraft engine {{is one of}} the most important systems for flight operation and is the heart of the aircraft engine pneumatic system. It consists of ducts and components that supply high pressure bleed air from the engine compressor to the other systems. The functioning of bleed air system plays a vital role in flight safety, ground operations, and coordination with other existing systems [1] including fuel <b>system,</b> <b>lubrication</b> system, ignition system, and anti-ice system. A prior Wichita State University Research and Creative Award (URCA) research project entitled "Aircraft Pneumatic Leak Detection Methods" was the motivation for this thesis work. In this research, different inspection techniques were studied to detect leaks in bleed air ducts. Existing conditions such as continuous high pressure and temperature loading within a duct can make it prone to leak because of high stress concentration areas, pre-existing flaws, or manufacturing defects. A general-purpose finite element package, ABAQUS was used for stress analysis of cracked structures such as tubular T-joints. The high stress concentration region at the intersection of the duct joints was assumed to have certain initial flaws. This initial crack flaw was analyzed using line-spring elements to compute the stress intensity factor (SIF). The values of SIF obtained from the present analysis were compared with appropriate results in the literature. Stresses from the finite element analysis were used as input in AFGROW, a crack growth software package consisting of extensive material properties and all necessary fracture mechanics parameters required for crack-growth analysis. Damage tolerance was applied to estimate the life of the duct. The leak-before-break concept was used to determine whether crack growth in the duct would lead to any kind of leak or catastrophic failure. Crack and leak detection techniques to evaluate the crack size are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{assessment}} {{has been carried}} out to discover whether reliability centred maintenance (RCM) is an applicable method to construct a maintenance program for a specific system on board a vessel within Wilhelmsen Ship Management s (WSM) fleet. Constructing efficient and appropriate maintenance programs for technical equipment on ships has become a key concern in the maritime industry. This is a result of a growing concern towards environmental and safety aspects, as well as an increased usage of capital intensive vessels, giving large downtime costs if normal operation is interrupted (Rasmussen, 2003). Maintenance programs connected to technical ship systems are commonly defined by recommendations from manufacturers and classification societies (Mokashi et al., 2002). Yet, it is not necessarily given that the recommended practices are outlined in an optimal manner considering the equipment in its operating context (Linton, 2011, Wang et al., 2010). Henceforth, the issue addressed within the present study is how the RCM practice can be employed as an alternative approach, which is of relevance to create a maintenance program more on the premises of the equipment. This has been achieved by analysing an engine and its auxiliary systems installed on a vessel operated by WSM. These included the engine s sea- and freshwater cooling <b>system,</b> <b>lubrication</b> oil system and fuel system. The purpose has been to evaluate the RCM applicability in a maritime context and discuss if the resulting maintenance program could obtain an improved effect for a vessel s operation compared to following the common trend in traditional maritime maintenance. The development of the analysis is based on the RCM perspective of Moubray (1997) and criteria outlined in SAE International (1999). The technique provides advantages in handling various equipment and focuses on maintaining the function of a system in a cost effective manner (Selvik and Aven, 2011). The analysis was performed for the equipment through four stages. This involved establishing function descriptions, functional failures, failure modes, effects and criticality (FMECA) worksheets and proper maintenance tasks, focusing on each listed failure mode. System explanations were also included to describe the equipment being analysed. Criticality and risk evaluations were carried out in accordance with WSM s outlined consequence parameters and risk matrix. The majority of the data input was set during an RCM workshop at WSM s office. The first three stages founded the necessary basis to determine the final maintenance program. Applying the RCM process on the engine determined that the most critical failure modes potentially leading to engine stop were failure of its auxiliary systems, disregarding any engine component failure. The FMECA pointed out that the majority of failure modes at the lowest causation level were considered to have low criticality. Failure modes obtaining the highest risk indexes were: 	Closing valve failure and blackout of switchboards in the seawater cooling system 	Lack of chemical dosing in the freshwater cooling system 	Contaminated oil, filter failure and old oil in the lubrication oil system 	Wear/fatigue and assembly error for the purifier in the fuel oil system The information gathered in the FMECA enabled tailoring the maintenance to handle each evaluated failure mode, resulting in a program of both corrective and preventive actions. Further, the results were structured to provide a framework for continuous improvement and update of the maintenance program. The results provided a thorough arrangement of equipment data applicable for legitimating the choice of tasks in the maintenance program. Most of the evaluated failure modes received low risk indexes, resulting in more corrective means than expected. This indicated that it could be relevant for WSM to evaluate the vessel s spare part program. The diversity of tasks in the maintenance program corresponded well to the perception of RCM prioritising actions that improve system reliability. Due to limited time during the RCM workshop, the volume of equipment included in the analysis had to be reduced from the initial plan. However, this illustrated one of the known drawbacks of RCM, which is its extensive need for time and resources. From the analysis, it is clear that RCM may very well suit a maritime context. Constructing a maintenance program by employing this practice would provide beneficial results for a shipping company. Yet, the method is mainly considered applicable to fit equipment that by function failure would be critical towards safety and/or operation...|$|E
