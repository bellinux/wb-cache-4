40|$|When one {{considers}} a quadratic differential system, one realizes that {{it depends on}} 12 parameters of which one can be fixed {{by means of a}} time change. One also can notice that fixing 4 finite real <b>singular</b> <b>points</b> plus 3 infinite real ones (all its possible <b>singular</b> <b>points)</b> implies to fix 11 conditions, that is, 11 equations that the parameters must satisfy. Since these conditions are linear with respect to the parameters, it is obvious to think that the system will be determined, except that the fixed conditions are incompatible with a quadratic differential system having finitely many <b>singular</b> <b>points.</b> In this paper we prove exactly this. That is, if we fix the position of the 7 <b>singular</b> <b>points</b> of a quadratic differential system in a distribution that does not force an infinite number of finite <b>singular</b> <b>points,</b> then the system is completely determined, and consequently its phase portrait is also determined. This determination includes the local behavior of all <b>singular</b> <b>points,</b> even if they are weak focus or centers, the global behavior of separatrices, and even the existence or not of limit cycles. This also implies that limit cycles are sensitive to small perturbations of the coordinates of <b>singular</b> <b>points,</b> even if they are far from the <b>singular</b> <b>points.</b> The result of the paper goes far beyond this, since we state that this result is independent {{of the fact that the}} fixed <b>singular</b> <b>points</b> are real or complex, and it does not mind if the infinite <b>singular</b> <b>points</b> are simple or multiple due to the collision of several infinite <b>singular</b> <b>points.</b> Only when some data is lost due to the collision of finite <b>singular</b> <b>points</b> or to the collision of some finite <b>singular</b> <b>points</b> with infinite ones, this adds free parameters to the set of parameters at the same rate than the number of finite <b>singular</b> <b>points</b> are lost...|$|R

These <b>singular</b> <b>points</b> (cores and deltas) not only represent the characteristics of local ridge patterns but also determine the topological structure (i. e., fingerprint type) and largely influence the orientation field. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for <b>singular</b> <b>points</b> detection. After an initial detection using the conventional Poincaré Index method, a so-called DORIC feature is used to remove spurious <b>singular</b> <b>points.</b> Then, the optimal combination of <b>singular</b> <b>points</b> is selected to minimize {{the difference between the}} original orientation field and the model-based orientation field reconstructed using the <b>singular</b> <b>points.</b> A core-delta relation is used as a global constraint for the final selection of <b>singular</b> <b>points.</b> Experimental results show that our algorithm is accurate and robust, giving better results than competing approaches. The proposed detection algorithm can also be used for more general 2 D oriented patterns, such as fluid flow motion, and so forth.
