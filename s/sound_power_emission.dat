40|$|<b>Sound</b> <b>power</b> {{describes}} a <b>sound</b> source {{regardless of its}} environment and is useful in noise control applications, but can be cumbersome and time consuming to measure. <b>Sound</b> <b>power</b> levels can rank different sound sources and is often restricted in noise control legislation. An acoustic camera records a sound field with a microphone array. Due to properties of the array, and by using beamforming algorithms, an acoustic camera can separate sound from different directions. The acoustic camera measures sound pressure from a sound source. By assuming directivity properties the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> of a <b>sound</b> source {{can be derived from}} the sound pressure. In this thesis an acoustic camera has been evaluated in order to determine <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> estimation performance and sound source separation ability. This is tested by six different measurement set-ups in an anechoic chamber. Two different sound sources are used in the trials: one reference sound source and one disturbing sound source. The reference sound source has a calibrated and documented <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> level to which the measurement results are compared. Measurements were performed at 1 to 5 m distance from the acoustic camera with both sound sources. The influence of a disturbing sound source on the reference <b>sound</b> source <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> level was measured with the sound sources separated 0. 65 m to 2. 6 m. The measurements show that the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> level could at best be determined within 1 dB. The acoustic camera can separate different sound sources well. Influence from a disturbing sound source, 10 dB SPL stronger and distanced 1 m from a reference sound source was 2 to 3 dB for mid-frequency one-third octave bands at 5 m measurement distance.

40|$|Numerical {{predictions}} of the acoustic characteristics of an Active Twist Rotor (ATR), using two methods to compute the rotor blade aerodynamics and elastic blade motion are compared to experimental data from a wind tunnel test in the NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) in 2000. The first method, a loosely coupled iterative method, utilizes the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code OVERFLOW 2 and the Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD) code CAMRAD II. The second method utilizes the CAMRAD II free-wake model only. The harmonic active-twist control to the main rotor blade system is identified with three parameters - harmonic actuation frequency, actuation amplitude, and control phase angle. The resulting aerodynamics and blade motion data from the two methods are then used in the acoustics code PSU-WOPWOP to predict acoustic pressure on a spherical array of equally spaced observers surrounding the rotor. This spherical distribution of pressure is used to compute the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> level representing baseline and actuated conditions. <b>Sound</b> <b>power</b> levels for three categories of noise are defined as - blade-vortex interaction <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> level (BVIPWL), low frequency <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> level (LFPWL), and overall <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> level, OAPWL.

40|$|The {{identification}} and characterization of <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> radiated by engine components {{is an important}} challenge for car manufacturers such as PSA. This presentation will show the approach used, the results obtained and the analysis of those results during a study done with PSA to evaluate the contribution of each component on the total <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> radiated by an engine. In {{the first part of}} the study, a standard 2 D acoustic imaging technique, based on combined holography and beamforming method, was used to evaluate the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> radiated by faces of an engine and to identify the most radiating areas. The precision of this technique is however not sufficient to quantify the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> radiated by components of the engine. This limitation is mainly due to the approximation of the engine face by a 2 D plane. In the second part of this study, an innovating technique has been applied, using a 3 D meshing of the engine and precise definition of each component on this meshing. Based on measurement done on an acoustic array successively positioned on four sides of the engine and a precise positioning of the array in regards to the meshing, it is possible to rebuild the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> radiated by elements of the meshing and thus obtain the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> spectrum radiated by each components of the engine for various configurations. Such experimental data have many interests for PSA: At first, it gives data concerning the overall acoustic power level of this engine. It gives information about the noisiest sources on each face of the engine. So, it gives orientation concerning the strategy of the noise reduction of the engine. It provides data to fix the different acoustic targets. By having the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> level and spectrum of the mainly components, it is possible to build the targets to achieve by the suppliers on their benches.

40|$|Windows are a {{significant}} path for structure-borne and air-borne noise transmission into aircraft. To improve the acoustical performance, damped windows were fabricated using two or three layers of plexiglas with transparent viscoelastic damping material sandwiched between the layers. In this paper, numerical and experimental results are {{used to evaluate the}} acoustic benefits of damped windows. Tests were performed in the Structural Acoustic Loads and Transmission Facility at NASA Langley Research Center to measure the transmission loss for diffuse acoustic excitation and radiated <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> for point force excitation. Comparisons between uniform and damped plexiglas windows showed increased transmission loss of 6 dB at the first natural frequency, 6 dB at coincidence, and 4. 5 dB over a 50 to 4 k Hz range. Radiated <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> was reduced up to 7 dB at the lower natural frequencies and 3. 7 dB over a 1000 Hz bandwidth. Numerical models are presented for the prediction of radiated <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> for point force excitation and transmission loss for diffuse acoustic excitation. Radiated <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> and transmission loss predictions are in good agreement with experimental data. A parametric study is presented that evaluates the optimum configuration of the damped plexiglas windows for reducing the radiated <b>sound</b> <b>power.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{cases where}} a {{structure}} 2 ̆ 7 s excitation cannot be altered, the sound {{radiation from the}} structure must be minimized by modifying the structure within given design constraints. This dissertation considers minimizing sound radiated by an existing structure with minimal changes to the structure itself. To accomplish this the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> radiated by a structure was written {{as a function of}} the normal surface velocity using the boundary element method. The feasibility of reducing radiated <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> with small patches of constrained layer damping material is proved. Small patches of constrained layer damping material are placed on the structure to effectively reduce radiated sound using reactive structural shearing intensity. The size, shape, and number of patches is explored. Two gradient methods are then used to minimize <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> radiated by a structure {{as a function of the}} area covered by constrained layer damping. The method of simulated annealing was used to minimized <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> as a function of damping patch area in cases where gradient methods proved unsuccessful. Reductions in <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> radiated at a single frequency of over 10 dB were achieved by covering just 1. 1 percent of the total structural surface area with constrained layer damping material...|$|R
