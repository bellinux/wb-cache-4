25|$|In 2002 Euro NCAP {{gave the}} PT Cruiser a three (out of five) stars rating. The car {{received}} bad {{results in the}} frontal impact test (6 out of 16 possible points). The height of the seats and side airbags helped to attain a maximum score of 16 points in the <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test.</b> The low frontal scores are in part explained by the cushioning near the knees, designed to protect unbelted occupants, {{which is not a}} factor in the EU where passengers must wear seat belts.|$|E
25|$|According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), Volvo's S80 {{became one}} of the 2009 Top Safety Picks Award winners. The {{previous}} versions of the S40 and S60 models (2005–09 models with standard side airbags) failed to attain the highest rating in their <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test.</b> However, according to the IIHS, in recent years Volvo cars have still managed to maintain their high class safety ratings as seen in test results. The Volvo XC90, S80, C70, XC60, S60 and C30 are all rated Top Safety Picks in these crash tests. The 2014 models of the XC60, XC90, S60 and S80 have even received the Top Safety Pick+ rating.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of a design methodology for vehicle safety design to comply with the different <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> crash regulations that are used around the world. The main differences of each <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> and potential influences on vehicle design were identified. Door intrusion velocity, door trim component stiffness and seat airbag were selected as three design variables. Sled test finite element models based on the Heidelberg buck sled test set-up were developed to investigate the sensitivity of three design factors to the occupant injury in both moving deformable barrier test and oblique pole test load conditions. Occupant injury response variations were assessed at different levels of the design factors. From the simulation results, for moving deformable barrier test, there is a balance between limiting the thorax injury and abdominal injury. For the Oblique pole test, the simulation results show that the padding system development may be more effective than the vehicle structure enhancement. Design guidelines that would enable vehicles to comply with different <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> were extracted based on the simulation results...|$|R
