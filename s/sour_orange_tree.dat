40|$|Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) {{populations are}} {{composed}} of closely related haplotypes whose frequencies in the population result from the equilibrium between mutation, selection and genetic drift. The genetic diversity of CEVd populations infecting different citrus hosts was studied by comparing populations recovered from infected trifoliate <b>orange</b> and <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> seedling <b>trees</b> after 10 years of evolution, with the ancestral population maintained {{for the same period}} in the original host, Etrog citron. Furthermore, populations isolated from these trifoliate <b>orange</b> and <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> <b>trees</b> were transmitted back to Etrog citron plants and the evolution of their mutant spectra was studied. The results indicate that (i) the amount and composition of the within-plant genetic diversity generated varies between these two hosts and is markedly different from that which is characteristic of the original Etrog citron host and (ii) the genetic diversity found after transmitting back to Etrog citron is indistinguishable from that which is characteristic of the ancestral Etrog citron population, regardless of the citrus plant from which the evolved populations were isolated. The relationship between the CEVd populations from Etrog citron and trifoliate orange, both sensitive hosts, and those from <b>sour</b> <b>orange,</b> which is a tolerant host, is discussed. L.

40|$|In {{recent years}} a serious disease of citrus (the orange cv. Washington navel, lemon {{and the common}} {{mandarin}} grafted on <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> rootstocks) has been observed in southern Greek orchards. Affected trees decline, their leaves become yellow and fall early, and shoots and twigs die as the damage expands towards the trunk. Crosssections of the trunks and large branches reveal a light-colored rot in the center, which is surrounded by brown hard necrotic wood. Symptoms start from pruned areas and spread to the rootstock wood, and then resemble esca of grapevine. From the white rotted areas, a fungus was isolated on PDA that formed cream-yellow to light-brown colonies with dense aerial mycelium. Fungal fruit-bodies formed abundantly on the trunks of diseased trees. The fungus was identified as Fomitiporia mediterranea by both traditional and molecular methods. Pathogenicity tests were performed by artificially inoculating orange, mandarin, lemon and <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> <b>trees</b> with the fungus. Control holes were filled with two PDA plugs. Branches inoculated with the isolates from infected citrus showed wood discoloration that extended up to 20 cm above and 20 cm below the infection hole.

40|$|Citrus and {{watermelons}} {{are valuable}} economic crops worldwide, contributing approximately $ 120 million combined {{each year in}} Texas alone. Both citrus and watermelons are sensitive to saline conditions, which can be problematic in the Lower Rio Grande Valley where they are commonly produced. As Texas increases the percentage of irrigated agriculture each year, and in turn the amount of land potentially exposed to salinization through this practice, grafting salt sensitive plants to tolerant rootstocks becomes a more feasible way to overcome this challenge. Grafting typically improves disease resistance, cold tolerance, yield, fruit quality and {{has been shown to}} improve salt tolerance as well. While citrus is commonly grafted to rootstocks that induce desirable qualities in the scion, watermelon grafting is only common in Asia and several European countries due to cost constraints. The main goal of this research was to assess selected rootstocks for salinity tolerance by evaluating plant growth and physiological parameters when subjected to several salinity levels. In the first experiment, potential <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> replacement rootstocks C 22 and C 146 were evaluated for salinity as ungrafted trees and grafted to the Olinda Valencia scion. These trees were then compared to the performance of grafted and ungrafted <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> <b>trees.</b> The results suggest that C 22 and C 146 rootstocks are more tolerant to saline conditions than <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> rootstocks at moderate salinity levels. However, grafting significantly decreased all measured growth and physiological parameters for all rootstocks implying that this scion-rootstock combination may not be ideal. In the second experiment, TAMU mini watermelons were grafted to four rootstocks to determine if any of these would improve their performance when subjected to poor quality irrigation water. Of the four rootstocks and ungrafted TAMU mini watermelon, Strong Tosa showed the most growth when subjected to moderate salinity.

40|$|Tristeza disease, {{caused by}} the Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV), {{is the most important}} viral disease for almost all the citrus species. Main syndromes are quick decline, stem pitting, vein clearing and seedlings yellows but expression and intensity of symptomatology depends on the interactions of the factors involved in the pathosystem such as host-strain-rootstock-climate-vector. Several isolates of CTV have been studied all over the world. Two Corsican isolates have been previously characterized, the K strain from Marumi kumquat, known to be symptomless on Mexican lime, and the CaL - 1 from calamondin inducing stem pitting, but no sequences of p 20 gene are published or available in GenBank. Two additional CTV strains were recently found in Corsica.

5000|$|The {{original}} palace {{was commissioned}} by Sophie Charlotte, the wife of Friedrich III, Elector of Brandenburg {{in what was then}} the village of Lietzow. Originally named Lietzenburg, the palace was designed by Johann Arnold Nering in baroque style. It consisted of one wing and was built in [...] storeys with a central cupola. The façade was decorated with Corinthian pilasters. On the top was a cornice on which were statues. At the rear in the centre of the palace were two oval halls, the upper one being a ceremonial hall and the lower giving access to the gardens. Nering died during the construction of the palace and the work was completed by Martin Grünberg and Andreas Schlüter. The inauguration of the palace was celebrated on 11 July 1699, Frederick's 42nd birthday.Friedrich crowned himself as King Friedrich I in Prussia in 1701 (Friedrich II, known as Frederick the Great, would later achieve the title King of Prussia). Two years previously, he had appointed Johann Friedrich von Eosander (also known as Eosander von Göthe) as the royal architect and sent him to study architectural developments in Italy and France, particularly the Palace of Versailles. On his return in 1702, Eosander began to extend the palace, starting with two side wings to enclose a large courtyard, and the main palace was extended on both sides. Sophie Charlotte died in 1705 and Friedrich named the palace and its estate Charlottenburg in her memory. In the following years, the Orangery was built on the west of the palace and the central area was extended with a large domed tower and a larger vestibule. On top of the dome is a wind vane {{in the form of a}} gilded statue representing Fortune designed by Andreas Heidt. The Orangery was originally used to overwinter rare plants.

In this study, we {{observed that the}} release of T. urticae herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) from <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> plants has a marked repellent effect on conspecific mites associated with {{the production of the}} terpenes α-ocimene, α-farnesene, pinene and d-limonene, and the green leaf volatile 4 -hydroxy- 4 -methyl- 2 -pentanone. By contrast, T. urticae HIPVs from Cleopatra mandarin plants promote conspecific mite attraction associated with an increase in (2 -butoxyethoxy) ethanol, benzaldehyde and methyl salicylate levels. HIPVs released from <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> plants following T. urticae infestation induce resistance in Cleopatra mandarin plants, thereby reducing oviposition rates and stimulating the oxylipin biosynthetic gene lipoxygenase 2 (LOX 2). Cleopatra HIPVs do not affect the response to T. urticae of these rootstocks. We conclude that <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> plants promote herbivore-induced resistance in Cleopatra mandarin plants and, despite the weak basal resistance of these rootstocks, herbivore resistance can be induced through the combination of HIPVs, such as α-ocimene and d-limonene.

Plantas adultas são muitos resistentes, quase imunes. A recuperação do vírus da tristeza de plantas de laranja azeda infetadas é efetuada com facilidade por meio de enxertia e com muita dificuldade por meio do vetor. Os sintomas comumente apresentados por mudinhas de laranja azêda afetadas, consistem em amarelecimento das fôlhas novas, paralisação no crescimento e eventual queda das fôlhas amareladas. Em caso de infecção com estirpes fracas do vírus, os sintomas são menos evidentes e comumente há recuperação. As fôlhas formadas após recuperação, muitas vêzes apresentam palidez de pequenas extensões das nervuras. Os tecidos do floema da laranjeira azêda, abaixo do enxêrto de laranjeira doce infetada, mostram degeneração. Êstes sintomas têm sido utilizados para distinguir a tristeza de outras moléstias que causam declínio da planta. Sintomas de depressões no lenho ("pitting") raramente se manifestam em laranjeira azêda. Não se conhece presentemente nenhuma variedade de laranja azêda tolerante à tristeza, não se podendo, portanto, utilizar êsse cavalo para copas nas quais o vírus da tristeza se multiplica e atinge concentrações elevadas. Entretanto, a laranjeira azeda ainda pode ser usada como cavalo para alguns limões dos tipos Eureka e Siciliano e para a própria laranjeira azêda, em áreas invadidas pela moléstia. Há possibilidade de que o cavalo de azêda possa vir a ser novamente empregado para variedades que usualmente perecem quando nela enxertadas, lançando-se mão de medidas auxiliares como a inoculação prévia da copa com uma estirpe fraca do vírus, pela utilização do tipo de copa com união múltipla, etc. Borbulhas de plantas de laranja azêda afetadas pela tristeza nem sempre encerram o vírus. Borbulhas de plantas afetadas ou de plantas sadias se desenvolvem mais ou menos satisfatòriamente quando sôbre-enxertadas em galhos de laranjeira doce sobre laranjeira azêda, já em avançado estado de declínio. Uma copa mista de laranjeiras azêda e doce sôbre cavalo de azêda pode causar alguns benefícios à planta afetada pela tristeza sob determinadas condições, mas êsse benefício não é duradouro e o método não oferece possibilidades práticas. A laranjeira azêda em viveiro tem sido utilizada com vantagem na determinação da presença do vírus da tristeza em borbulhas de vários tipos de Citrus, pela observação do crescimento feito a partir dessas borbulhas em comparação com aquêle de borbulhas da mesma variedade garantidamente sadias. Para a determinação da presença de estirpes fracas do vírus o método é mais demorado. Interenxertos de laranjeira azêda entre copas e raízes de laranjeira doce são suficientes para que haja manifestação de sintomas da moléstia. Há aparentemente alguma translocação através do interenxêrto, pois o desenvolvimento do cavalo abaixo e acima dele é aproximadamente igual. Young <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> seedlings {{are more}} easily infected with the tristeza virus by approach-grafts than {{by means of the}} aphid vector. Under natural conditions adult plants in the field are highly resistant to infection by the aphid vector. Recovery of the tristeza virus from infected <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> plants is also more easily accomplished by tissue union than by means of the aphid vector. <b>Sour</b> <b>orange</b> seedlings show yellowing of young leaves followed by stunting and shedding of leaves when infected with the ordinary strain of the tristeza virus in Brazil. These symptoms do not differ from those described for seedling yellows. The symptoms of leaf yellowing are less evident in plants infected with mild strains of the tristeza virus and there is subsequent recovery. New flushes of young leaves may show occasional vein dashes. <b>Sour</b> <b>orange</b> tissues below the bud union of the sweet orange onsour orange rootstock show phloem degeneration when the plant is affected with tristeza. These degeneration symptoms have been used to distinguish tristeza disease from other decline diseases that affect the same stock-scion combination. Over 45 varieties of <b>sour</b> <b>oranges</b> have been tried as rootstocks for tristeza infected sweet orange tops and they all behaved as non-tolerant rootstocks. So far no tristeza tolerant <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> rootstock is known, but it seems entirely possible that crosses between <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> and tristeza-tolerant citrus varieties may yield F 1 hydrids that combine the desirable characteristics of the <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> rootstock with tristeza tolerant tissues. In case such an F 1 hybrid produced large number of nucellar seedlings these could be used as rootstocks. <b>Sour</b> <b>orange</b> varieties can be used as rootstocks for commercial acid lemons or <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> tops even in areas where tristeza is present. There is as slight possibility that if a somewhat tolerant <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> is found, it might be used a 3 rootstock for grapefruits, sweet orange, mandarin, and other tristeza susceptible tops if complementary controlling measures are employed such as protective inoculation of the scion with mild strains of the virus, use of multiple bud union, etc. Tests have shown that buds from a single budstick taken from a tristeza infected <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> plant may produce healthy and diseased tops when budded on a <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> rootstock, thus indicating that tristeza virus was not present in all buds of the infected plant. It has been observed that commercial acid lemon and <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> buds make satisfactory growth when top worked on tristeza-diseased sweet <b>orange</b> tops on <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> rootstocks. Attempts have been made to control tristeza disease in sweet <b>orange</b> on <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> rootstock by inducing the rootstock to develop sprouts and thus produce a <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> top that would supply sinthates for the roots. The presence of this composite sweet <b>orange</b> and <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> top may be of benefit to the plant when it is infected by tristeza, but this effect is not lasting and the method has been unsuccessful when tried in commercial orchards in Brazil. <b>Sour</b> <b>orange</b> seedlings in nursery rows have been used in Brazil to determine the presence of the ordinary strains of the tristeza virus in budwood from many citrus varieties. In this "sour test" the growth of buds to be tested has been compared with the growth of healthy buds of the same variety. Intergrafts of <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> stem between a sweet orange top and a sweet orange rootstock were sufficient to induce the plants to show tristeza symptoms when infected. Three, 10, and 80 - 100 cm intergrafts were tried and even the 3 cm intergraft was enough to cause injury in the infected plants. When sweet orange was budded with a multiple union, i. e. on three or four upper branches of <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> plants there was less apparent injury from tristeza virus infection than in case of a single bud union...|$|R

Pratylenchus coffeae on inoculated trees increased to significantly damaging population densities on rough lemon rootstock the second year, on <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> the third and on Cleopatra mandarin the fourth year after planting. Mean growth reduction of P. coffeae-infected trees after 4 years was 80, 77 and 49 %, respectively, for the three rootstocks. Noninoculated trees on rough lemon and <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> rootstocks yielded significantly more fruit than comparable inoculated trees.

40|$|Tristeza, {{caused by}} Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV), {{has long been}} present in Florida but outbreaks of decline on <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> rootstock were occasional events until the late 1970 s. <b>Sour</b> <b>orange</b> rootstock was valued for the high quality of fruit produced and was widely used because of its tolerance of citrus blight, a disease of unknown etiology. Research was directed towards the selection and screening of mild strains of CTV which could protect against <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> decline strains. Following the introduction of Toxoptera citricida (also known as the brown citrus aphid [BrCA]) in 1995 there was a greater concern for maintaining production of existing blocks of citrus on <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> rootstock. Availability of the CTV genome sequence {{around the same time}} as well as molecular characterization of in planta CTV populations led to the selection of mild CTV isolates which when inoculated into existing field trees, extended the productive life of the groves and enabled a more graduate replanting of trees on CTV-tolerant rootstocks. The history of CTV in Florida and the methods developed to select mild isolates for use for mild strain cross protection will be reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Viruses {{have evolved}} as {{combinations}} of genes whose products interact with cellular components to produce progeny virus throughout the plants. Some viral genes, {{particularly those that}} are involved in replication and assembly, tend to be relatively conserved, whereas other genes that have evolved for interactions with the specific host for movement and to counter host–defense systems tend to be less conserved. Closteroviridae encode 1 – 5 nonconserved ORFs. Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), a Closterovirus, possesses nonconserved p 33, p 18, and p 13 genes that are expendable for systemic infection of the two laboratory hosts, Citrus macrophylla and Mexican lime. In this study, we show that the extended host range of CTV requires these nonconserved genes. The p 33 gene was required to systemically infect <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> and lemon <b>trees,</b> whereas either the p 33 or the p 18 gene was sufficient for systemic infection of grapefruit trees and the p 33 or the p 13 gene was sufficient for systemic infection of calamondin plants. Thus, these three genes are required for systemic infection of the full host range of CTV, but different genes were specific for different hosts. Remarkably, either of two genes was sufficient for infection of some citrus hybrids. These findings suggest that CTV acquired multiple nonconserved genes (p 33, p 18, and p 13) and, as a result, gained the ability to interact with multiple hosts, thus extending its host range during the course of evolution. These results greatly extend the complexity of known virus–plant interactions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} salinity stress-relief on the growth and mineral composition (leaf and root) of one-year-old seedlings of Cleopatra mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco) and <b>Sour</b> <b>orange</b> (Citrus aurantium [L]). Salinization reduced plant dry weight more in <b>Sour</b> <b>orange</b> than in Cleopatra mandarin plants, {{although there was no}} correlation between Cl and Na concentration in leaves and shoot fresh weight reduction. We observed that regulation of Na+ and Cl- uptake and transport from root to shoot appear to involve different mechanisms which break down during a long period of salinization. Salinity induced a decrease in K+, Ca 2 + and total N in Cleopatra mandarin leaves and an increase in K+ in <b>Sour</b> <b>orange</b> leaves. Growth of both cultivars was not recovered totally in the relief period, since relative growth rates of recovered plants were lower than for control plants after 60 days of relief...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the formation of adventitious buds and in vitro regeneration of <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> plants (Citrus aurantium L.) two organogenesis-inducing experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, the induction and in vitro regeneration of adventitious buds were tested on epicotyl and internodal segments {{under the influence of}} BAP or KIN associated with NAA. The second experiment evaluated the in vitro regeneration of <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> plants related to different explant types (epicotyls segments, internodal segments of in vitro germinated plantlets and internodal segments of greenhouse cultivated plants). Data collected on both experiments included the percentage of responsive explants (explants that formed buds), and the number of buds per explant. The addition of BAP showed the best organogenic response. In vitro germinated epicotyl segments and internodal segments are recommended as explants for <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> in vitro organogenesis.

40|$|The {{effect of}} 10 calcium salts in {{controlling}} Phytophthora root rot of citrus was evaluated both in vitro, on agar and liquid media, and in vivo, on <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> citrus seedlings. In vitro, calcium salts were applied at 300, 600, and 1200 ppm. Calcium oxide and calcium carbonate significantly reduced {{the growth of}} P. nicotianae, {{in comparison with the}} control; minimum dry weight of the mycelium. was observed with calcium oxide; moreover, this salt significantly reduced zoospore production and their viability. In vivo, calcium salts were applied at 1200 ppm on 4 -month old <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> seedlings. Calcium propionate and calcium lactate significantly reduced the inoculum density of the pathogen in the soil, whereas all the,other calcium salts-except nitrate, pantothenate and gluconate-significantly reduced root infections in comparison with the control.
