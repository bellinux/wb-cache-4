5|$|At the marshal's signal, silence descended {{over the}} field and both knights spurred their horses and charged, their lances each {{striking}} the other's shield but not causing significant damage. Wheeling, both again struck but failed to penetrate, scoring glancing blows on their helmets but remaining horsed. For a third time they turned and charged and again they both struck. This time however the lances shattered, sending <b>slivers</b> <b>of</b> wood cartwheeling across the arena and nearly unseating both men. Regaining balance, the knights closed on one another with battle axes drawn, trading furious two-handed blows. As the engagement progressed, Le Gris' superior strength began to tell and Carrouges was driven back until with a mighty swing, Le Gris' axe severed the spine of Carrouges' horse. The dying beast tumbled to the ground, Carrouges leaping clear and meeting Le Gris' charge with a side-step, allowing him to thrust his own axe's pike deep into the stomach of Le Gris' steed.|$|E
25|$|A {{small area}} in Veracruz state around La Joya {{is known for}} its smoked cheeses made with whole raw cows’ milk and are pressed after curdling. The cheese is often served with ham, chili peppers, epazote and <b>slivers</b> <b>of</b> jalapeños. Another kind of Veracruz cheese. marqueta, is a white cheese which is often coated with chili pepper paste. The Yucatan area also makes a type of bola cheese, {{although}} this version is harder all the way through and is filled with small, irregular holes. Another type, queso de barra, is similar to panela.|$|E
25|$|Very {{nearly as}} {{visually}} evocative are the scenes involving Astor, {{almost all of}} which suggest prison. In one scene she wears striped pajamas, the furniture {{in the room is}} striped, and the <b>slivers</b> <b>of</b> light coming through the Venetian blinds suggest cell bars, as do the bars on the elevator cage {{at the end of the}} film when she takes her slow ride downward with the police, apparently on her way to prison and possible execution. Huston and Edeson crafted each scene to make sure the images, action and dialog blended effectively, sometimes shooting closeups of characters with other cast members acting with them off camera.|$|E

25|$|Whale {{meat and}} blubber are Faroese delicacies. Well into the 20th century, meat and blubber {{from the pilot}} whale was used to feed people {{for long periods of}} time. Everybody got a share, as is the custom to this day. The meat and blubber can be stored and {{prepared}} in a variety of ways, in Faroese it is called Tvøst og spik. When fresh, the meat is boiled or served as steaks. A pilot whale steak is called in Faroese: grindabúffur. Whale meat with blubber and potatoes in their skins are put into a saucepan with salt and then boiled for an hour or so. <b>Slivers</b> <b>of</b> the blubber are also a popular accompaniment to dried fish.|$|E
25|$|In the French comb the <b>slivers</b> <b>of</b> wool are fed {{forward by}} ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|E
25|$|The Holden comb was {{suited for}} the combing of short staple wools. The <b>slivers</b> <b>of</b> wool are fed into the machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the pins of the comb circle by the lashing action of the filling heads. As the comb circle rotates, the fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in the comb circle by the keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As the comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur combs, the drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the pins of the nacteur comb and the comb circle; the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils remaining in the nacteur combs are transferred to the comb circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in the comb circle pins by brushes and lifting knives and deposited into a box ready for removal.|$|E

25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the <b>slivers</b> <b>of</b> wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the fluted feed rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|E
500|$|In Koechlin's view, [...] "Apart {{from the}} Préludes of Chopin, {{it is hard}} to think of a {{collection}} of similar pieces that are so important". The critic Michael Oliver wrote, [...] "Fauré's Préludes are among the subtlest and most elusive piano pieces in existence; they express deep but mingled emotions, sometimes with intense directness... more often with the utmost economy and restraint and with mysteriously complex simplicity." [...] Jessica Duchen calls them [...] "unusual <b>slivers</b> <b>of</b> magical inventiveness." [...] The complete set takes between 20 and 25 minutes to play. The shortest of the set, No 8, lasts barely more than a minute; the longest, No 3, takes between four and five minutes.|$|E
500|$|The head wounds are {{consistent}} with a 1485 poem by Guto'r Glyn in which a Welsh knight, Sir Rhys ap Thomas killed Richard and [...] "shaved the boar's head". It had been {{thought that this was}} a figurative description of Richard being decapitated, but the skeleton's head had clearly not been severed. Guto's description may instead be a literal account of the injuries that Richard suffered, as the blows sustained to the head would have sliced away much of his scalp and hair and <b>slivers</b> <b>of</b> bone. Other contemporary sources refer explicitly to head injuries and the weapons used to kill Richard; the French chronicler Jean Molinet wrote that [...] "one of the Welshmen then came after him, and struck him dead with a halberd", and the Ballad of Lady Bessie recorded that [...] "they struck his bascinet to his head until his brains came out with blood." [...] Such accounts would certainly fit the damage inflicted on the skull.|$|E

500|$|The track [...] "Junkie's Promise", sung by Moore, was {{described}} as a [...] "heroin vignette". It was originally interpreted by many as a tribute to Kurt Cobain of Nirvana. However, Moore later clarified that the song [...] "is purely about the emotional relationship between friends, one of which is a user. Any individual involved with drug addiction will lie to his friends for the self-serving need. It's the cruelest truth of the situation. Kurt may fit this profile and he was surely in my mind as I wrote but the song is not a specific dedication to him". Other songs such as [...] "Becuz" [...] and [...] "No Queen Blues" [...] were built upon [...] "numb grooves with <b>slivers</b> <b>of</b> melody, power, and gorgeously crafted noise". The final track on the album, [...] "The Diamond Sea", {{was described}} as a [...] "Neil Young-esque ballad billowing into an epic noise excursion". It is considered the longest track on any Sonic Youth album, excluding Sonic Youth Recordings releases. Due to its long duration, the song was edited down to 5:15 for release as a single, which also included an alternative 25-minute version as an additional track.|$|E
500|$|The {{complete}} Coleman material, in {{a collection}} edited by James Booth, was finally published in 2002. [...] Booth thought that the material would probably cause [...] "a huge amount of confusion and smoke because the politically correct brigade will jump on it". Anticipating the publication, Emma Hartley and Vanessa Thorpe in The Observer doubted the literary value of the works, citing [...] Motion's [...] view that the stories were [...] "little more than mild pornography" [...] which the mature poet would never have wished to see published. On publication, Booth's collection provoked a particularly hostile reaction from The Guardians critic Jenny Diski, whose review dismissed the Coleman writings as [...] "drivel" [...] and [...] "sad ramblings", unworthy of publication or critical attention, and not even valid pornography: [...] "Not a breast, not a clitoris is seen or mentioned." [...] Unlike serious pornographers, [...] "Larkin sketches a mere outline and then walks away with a snigger". Diski mocks Booth's reverential descriptions of the typescripts [...] "as though they were <b>slivers</b> <b>of</b> the True Cross", and concludes: [...] "Let this be a lesson, at least, to anyone who hasn't got around to chucking out the crap they wrote in their teens and early twenties." ...|$|E
