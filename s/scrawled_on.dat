Overcome by emotion, Marceline cries and begins singing along while the Ice King plays drums, oblivious as to what is actually going on.|$|E
500|$|C.Y. Lee fled war-torn China in the 1940s {{and came}} to the United States, where he {{attended}} Yale University's playwriting program, graduating in 1947 with an M.F.A. degree. [...] By the 1950s, he was barely making a living writing short stories and working as a Chinese teacher, translator and journalist for San Francisco Chinatown newspapers. [...] He had hoped to break into playwriting, but instead wrote a novel about Chinatown, The Flower Drum Song (originally titled Grant Avenue). [...] Lee initially had no success selling his novel, but his agent submitted it to the publishing house of Farrar, Straus and Cudahy. [...] The firm sent the manuscript to an elderly reader for evaluation. [...] The reader was found dead in bed, the manuscript beside him with the words [...] "Read this" [...] <b>scrawled</b> <b>on</b> it. [...] The publishing house did so, and bought Lee's novel, which became a bestseller in 1957.|$|E

National Day of Slayer, LLC, which describes itself as [...] "a non-profit corporation in the State of Wyoming", requested on their website that Slayer fanatics participate in [...] "The National Day of Slayer" [...] by coming together {{and listening to}} the group's tracks. However, vandals attacked St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York, by spray-painting a large pentagram in front of the doors, black inverted crosses in two columns in front of the main entrance, and the number six on three steps leading into the Seminary. The words [...] "Reign in Blood" [...] were <b>scrawled</b> <b>on</b> the seminary landing, while the phrase [...] "Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven", taken from Book 1 of John Milton's [...] poem Paradise Lost, was found inscribed on two inside columns.

He called his first night in 10050 Cielo Drive [...] "terrifying" [...] because he already knew it and read books related to the incident. Reznor chose the Tate house to calibrate his engineering skills and the band bought a large console and two Studer machines as resources, a move that he believed was cheaper than renting. The studio was also used for the recording of Marilyn Manson's debut album Portrait of an American Family, which Reznor co-produced. Marilyn Manson accepted Reznor's offer of signing a contract with Nothing Records.|$|E
500|$|Not {{only did}} the Department of Information art advisors {{consider}} these new works dull, but the War Office censors also objected to three of the paintings. Nevinson was quite happy to reverse the direction of traffic in the painting The Road from Arras to Bapaume but {{was not prepared to}} compromise over the other two paintings. The censor objected to A Group of Soldiers on the grounds that [...] "the type of man represented is not worthy of the British Army". Amid the sarcasm and vitirol of Nevinson's response, he did make the point that the soldiers in the painting were sketched from a group home on leave from the Front that he had encountered on the London Underground. The canvas was eventually passed for display. Not so Paths of Glory, Nevinson's painting of two fallen British soldiers in a field of mud and barbed wire. Told at the beginning of 1918 that the painting would not be passed for exhibition Nevinson insisted on displaying it with a brown strip of paper across it, with the word 'Censored' <b>scrawled</b> <b>on</b> it. This earned Nevinson a reprimand not just for displaying the painting but using the word 'Censored' without authorisation.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} March 1, 1993 in Kraków, Poland, with a planned schedule of 75 days. The crew shot {{at or near}} the actual locations, though the Płaszów camp had to be reconstructed in a nearby abandoned quarry, as modern high rise apartments were visible from the site of the original camp. Interior shots of the enamelware factory in Kraków were filmed at a similar facility in Olkusz, while exterior shots and the scenes on the factory stairs were filmed at the actual factory. The crew was forbidden to do extensive shooting or construct sets on the grounds at Auschwitz, so they shot at a replica constructed just outside the entrance. There were some antisemitic incidents. A woman who encountered Fiennes in his Nazi uniform told him that [...] "the Germans were charming people. They didn't kill anybody who didn't deserve it". Antisemitic symbols were <b>scrawled</b> <b>on</b> billboards near shooting locations, while Kingsley nearly entered a brawl with an elderly German-speaking businessman who insulted Israeli actor Michael Schneider. Nonetheless, Spielberg stated that at Passover, [...] "all the German actors showed up. They put on yarmulkes and opened up Haggadas, and the Israeli actors moved right next to them and began explaining it to them. And this family of actors sat around and race and culture were just left behind." ...|$|E

His subsequent investigation and the kidnapping of a Japanese man interested in giving him a letter leads Tintin to a ship called the Karaboudjan, where he is abducted by a syndicate of criminals who have hidden opium in the crab tins. Tintin escapes from his locked room after Snowy chews through his bonds and Tintin knocks out a man sent to bring him food, leaving the man bound and gagged in the room. Tintin encounters Captain Haddock, an alcoholic sea captain, who is manipulated by his first mate, Allan, and is unaware of his crew's criminal activities. Tintin hides in the locker under the bed and defeats Jumbo, the sailor left in the cabin, while Allan thinks Tintin has climbed out of the porthole back into the storeroom. He blows open the storeroom door, then finding it empty goes back to the Captain's room, where he finds Jumbo tied to a chair and gagged. Escaping the ship in a lifeboat after sending a radio message to the police about the cargo, a seaplane tries to attack them. Tintin and the Captain hijack the plane, tie up the pilots, and try to reach Spain. Haddock's drunken behaviour in a storm causes them to crash-land in the Sahara, where the crew escapes.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Górecki {{learned of}} an {{inscription}} <b>scrawled</b> <b>on</b> {{the wall of}} a cell in a German Gestapo prison in the town of Zakopane, which lies {{at the foot of the}} Tatra mountains in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna, a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944. It read O Mamo, nie placz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie (Oh Mamma do not cry, no. [...] Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you support me always). The composer recalled, [...] "I have to admit that I have always been irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in the face of death I would shout out in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words". He later explained, [...] "In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does not think about herself; whether she deserves her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was something extraordinary. And it really fascinated me." ...|$|E

Because Young pleaded guilty to murder, his exact motive for the crime was never determined, but medical experts and the judge were of the opinion that Young was medically—though probably not legally—insane.
