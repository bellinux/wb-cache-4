5|$|Raelians {{believe in}} {{reclaiming}} the <b>swastika</b> by restoring its historical meaning {{as a symbol}} of peace and good luck. <b>Swastika</b> has been used for millennia in the East as a religious symbol of peace and harmony.|$|E
5|$|All {{national}} emblems {{excluding the}} <b>Swastika</b> must be immediately destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, a Montreal anti-cult {{organization}} called Info-Cult made statements against the Raëlian Church with {{an article on}} Le Devoir, branding Raëlians as promoters of fascism and racism, due to the church's use of the <b>swastika</b> {{as part of their}} logo and the Raëlian description of an extraterrestrial global government in which those less than ten percent above average intelligence are excluded from the electorate. Outside Info-Cult's office, Raëlians spoke against the act of discriminating against a religious minority. On 2 January 1992, a dozen people protested against the use of the <b>swastika</b> in the Raëlian logo in Miami's Eden Roc Hotel. The use of the <b>swastika</b> and other Raelian practices has led to criticism from the group Hineni of Florida, an Orthodox Jewish organization.|$|E
5000|$|On January 24, 1923, the <b>Swastikas</b> {{beat the}} Regents by a 3-0 score. After the victory, the <b>Swastikas</b> {{were invited to}} play for the Alpine Cup at the Banff Winter Carnival. At the Carnival, the <b>Swastikas</b> beat the Vancouver Amazons by a 2-0 score. By virtue, the <b>Swastikas</b> were named Alpine Cup champions as they had {{defeated}} the defending champions. During the Carnival, the <b>Swastikas</b> played two scoreless games against the Calgary Regents, who attempted to win the Cup from them.|$|R
50|$|In January 1922, the Fernie Ladies Hockey Team {{was named}} the Fernie <b>Swastikas.</b> The uniform was {{composed}} of white knickers and red sweaters. The <b>Swastikas</b> would appear at the 1922 Calgary Winter Carnival and play the Calgary Regents. The <b>Swastikas</b> won by a 4-0 score.|$|R
50|$|The Traveller's Hotel in {{downtown}} Ladysmith, British Columbia, has a façade decorated with brickwork <b>swastikas.</b> Further north on Vancouver Island, the Japanese cemetery in Cumberland has several grave markers decorated with <b>swastikas.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>Swastika</b> Flag {{was to be}} used as {{a symbol}} to {{represent}} not only the National Socialist movement, but also the unity of the Nordic-Germanic peoples into a single state. The <b>swastika</b> was seen by many National Socialists as a fundamentally Germanic and European symbol despite its presence among many cultures worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The <b>swastika</b> {{was used}} as an early symbol by the Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom and others. Its {{earliest}} use in Scouting was on the Thanks Badge introduced in 1911. Lord Baden-Powell's 1922 design for the Medal of Merit added a <b>swastika</b> to the Scout Arrowhead to symbolize good luck for the recipient. In 1934, Scouters requested a change to the design because of the connection of the <b>swastika</b> with its more recent use by the German National Socialist Workers (Nazi) Party. A new Medal of Merit was issued by the Boy Scouts Association in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Another {{series of}} Chera coins depicts various animals along with symbols on its obverse and the Chera emblem on its reverse. Elephant, horse, bull, {{tortoise}} and lion are the animals depicted in this series, along with snake and fish. Symbols of inanimate objects include arched hills, battle axe, conch, river, <b>swastika,</b> trident, flowers and the sun.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Microsoft {{released}} a critical update (Knowledge Base Article 833407) to remove two <b>swastikas</b> (one diagonal, one straight) and a Star of David from this typeface, presumably after complaints from users {{who took the}} <b>swastikas</b> as support for Nazism.|$|R
50|$|After {{the loss}} to Canmore, the {{composition}} of the <b>Swastikas</b> team had changed. Dorothy Henderson had died on May 24. Elaine Ross moved to Edmonton (and would later play for the Edmonton Monarchs, while team founder Mary Dragon moved to the United States. With the formation of the Alberta Amateur Hockey Federation, the <b>Swastikas</b> could only play teams from Alberta at the Banff Winter Carnival. This would limit the level of competition for the <b>Swastikas.</b> The only opposition in British Columbia for the Fernie team was the newly formed Cranbrook Canucks. The <b>Swastikas</b> would not play a game in 1925, although Dahlia Schagel fulfilled her obligations as Carnival Queen at the 1925 Banff Winter Carnival.|$|R
50|$|After 1918, the Monarchs were {{coached by}} a man. The Monarchs would not win at the Banff Winter Carnival tournament again until 1926. In the final, the Monarchs would defeat the Fernie <b>Swastikas.</b> It {{was the last}} ever game for the <b>Swastikas.</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, {{the first}} law enacted by the Allied Control Council {{abolished}} all Nazi symbols and repealed all relevant laws. The possession of <b>swastika</b> flags is forbidden in several countries since then, with the importation or display of them forbidden particularly in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Crass spray-painted stencilled {{graffiti}} {{messages in}} the London Underground system and on advertising billboards, coordinated squats and organised political action. The band expressed its ideals by dressing in black, military-surplus-style clothing {{and using a}} stage backdrop amalgamating icons of perceived authority such as the Christian cross, the <b>swastika,</b> the Union Jack and the ouroboros.|$|E
5|$|A granite wall {{surrounds}} the temple, enclosing all its shrines and six of its seven bodies of water. The rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, is unfinished. A <b>swastika</b> shaped temple tank built in 800 AD by Kamban Araiyan {{during the reign}} of Dantivarman is outside the temple complex. The Vijayanagar and Nayak kings commissioned paintings {{on the walls of the}} shrine of Pudarikakshan, some of which are still present.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Swastikas</b> {{returned}} to the Banff Carnival in 1924 to defend their title. In the quarterfinals, the <b>Swastikas</b> defeated the Calgary Patricias by a 4-1 tally. Their opposition in the semifinals was a newly formed team called the Canmore Minnewankas. Team founder Edith Biggs would crack her rib {{in the first period}} of the game against Canmore. By the third period, Canmore was ahead 1-0 and had upset the <b>Swastikas.</b> Despite the loss, Fernie team captain Dahlia Schagel was elected as Carnival Queen for the upcoming year.|$|R

5|$|At the DAP, Hitler met Dietrich Eckart, {{one of the}} party's founders and {{a member}} of the occult Thule Society. Eckart became Hitler's mentor, exchanging ideas with him and {{introducing}} him to a wide range of Munich society. To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers Party; NSDAP). Hitler designed the party's banner of a <b>swastika</b> in a white circle on a red background.|$|E
5|$|In North America, several {{volumes of}} the manga have ranked within the weekly Nielsen BookScan graphic novels list, {{including}} volume five at both sixth and ninth in October 2004, volume six at sixth in February 2005, and volume seven at seventh in June 2005. In 2004, the Yu Yu Hakusho manga serialization sparked a controversy when a Florida grade school teacher issued a complaint about material found in an issue of the American Shonen Jump magazine purchased by a fifth-grade student at a Scholastic Book Fair. The complaint centered around portions of the manga containing violence, mild profanity, a character wearing a <b>swastika,</b> and another character smoking a cigarette. About 18,000 copies of the publication (out of 120,000) were returned from the fairs {{as a result of}} the matter. A Viz spokesperson defended the manga, clarifying that it is intended for older teens and that the alleged <b>swastika</b> is actually a Buddhist manji.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the temple}} are friezes showing stories from Hindu texts {{such as the}} Bhagavata Purana. These show the legend of cosmic ocean {{churning}} (Samudra Manthan) and Krishna's birth and flute playing indicating the theological and cultural significance of these in 7th century India. The ceiling and door head carvings show Gajalakshmi, the <b>swastika</b> symbols, flying couples, Brahma, Vishnu asleep on Shesha and others.|$|E

5|$|Some figurines {{have been}} defaced with profanity or Satanic symbols. In December 2008, for example, a {{fiberglass}} Baby Jesus valued at US$375 {{was stolen from}} a Eureka Springs, Arkansas park and later recovered, but had been defaced by racial slurs, a <b>swastika,</b> and a Hitler mustache. The eyes were also blacked out and pieces had been broken off, rendering it damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{feature of}} the Church of Christ Pantocrator is the rich and {{colourful}} decoration of its exterior walls. The most lavishly decorated part {{of the church is}} the east side with the apse, and as a whole all sides of the church exhibit different ornamentation. Interchanging strips of three or four rows of bricks and carved stones, which create an optical pattern, are the most basic type of decoration used. Rows of blind arches, four-leaved floral motifs, triangular ornaments, circular turquoise ceramics and brick <b>swastika</b> friezes run along the east wall. Ousterhout likens the appearance of the church's superimposed arcades to an aqueduct; an earlier example of that configuration can be observed in the Cappadocian church of Çanlı Kilise near Aksaray, Turkey. The inclusion of swastikas in the decoration is considered unusual and curious to tourists. It is explained by the medieval use of the <b>swastika</b> {{as a symbol of the}} Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Reichsmarschall standard, on a light blue field, {{featured}} a gold German eagle grasping a wreath surmounted by two batons overlaid with a <b>swastika.</b> The reverse side of the flag had the Großkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ("Grand Cross of the Iron Cross") surrounded by a wreath between four Luftwaffe eagles. The flag was carried by a personal standard-bearer at all public occasions.|$|E

5|$|The uniform was regular SS M43 field-jacket issue, with a divisional collar patch {{showing an}} arm holding a scimitar over a <b>swastika.</b> On {{the left arm}} was a Croatian armshield (red-white {{chessboard}}) and on the right an Edelweiss flower patch. The chessboard armshield was controversial, especially with the imams, who, after crossing the Sava river, removed them. Former SS personnel serving in the division were entitled to wear a Sig Rune badge that {{was attached to the}} left breast pocket of the tunic.|$|E
5|$|Currency {{was often}} used for {{settling}} judicial fines, taxes and payments for goods or services. However, remuneration for services to the king, officials and temples were often made {{in the form of}} land revenue. The oldest coins found at Anuradhapura date up to 200 BC. These earliest coins were punch marked rectangular pieces of silver known as kahavanu. These eventually became circular in shape, which were in turn followed by die struck coins. Uncoined metals, particularly gold and silver, were used for trading as well. Patterns of elephants, horses, <b>swastika</b> and Dharmacakra were commonly imprinted on the coins of this period.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{remained}} in aviation after the war. He tried barnstorming and briefly worked at Fokker. After {{spending most of}} 1919 living in Denmark, he moved to Sweden and joined Svensk Lufttrafik, a Swedish airline. Göring was often hired for private flights. During the winter of 1920–1921, {{he was hired by}} Count Eric von Rosen to fly him to his castle from Stockholm. Invited to spend the night, Göring may at this time have first seen the <b>swastika</b> emblem, which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge.|$|E

50|$|There {{have been}} various {{incidents}} of vandalism. Despite Eisenman's objections, for example, the pillars were {{protected by a}} graffiti-resistant coating because the government worried that neo-Nazis would try to spray paint them with <b>swastikas.</b> Indeed, <b>swastikas</b> were drawn on the stelae on five different occasions in this first year. In 2009, <b>swastikas</b> and anti-Semitic slogans were found on 12 of the 2,700 gray stone slabs. In 2014, the German government promised to strengthen security at the memorial after a video published on the Internet showed a man urinating and people launching fireworks from its grey concrete structure on New Year's Eve.|$|R
