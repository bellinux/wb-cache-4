40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>seganserin,</b> a {{specific}} 5 HT 2 antagonist, on human sleep were assessed in two experiments and {{compared to the}} effects of temazepam and sleep deprivation. During daytime recovery sleep after sleep deprivation, <b>seganserin</b> did not significantly enhance visually scored slow wave sleep (SWS, stages 3 + 4) or the EEG power density in the delta frequencies. Under these conditions temazepam reduced the power density in the delta and theta frequencies. During nighttime sleep after a nap in the evening, <b>seganserin</b> caused an increase in SWS, a reduction in intermittent wakefulness, and an enhancement of the power density in the delta and theta frequencies during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Temazepam induced a reduction in the power density in the delta and theta frequencies. It is concluded that the 5 HT 2 antagonist, <b>seganserin,</b> can induce SWS. However, since the spectral results showed that the changes in the sleep EEG were not identical to those induced by sleep deprivation it seems premature to conclude that 5 HT 2 receptors are primarily involved in NREM sleep regulation. ...|$|E
