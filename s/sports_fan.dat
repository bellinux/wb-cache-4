He did not take an interest in science until his junior year when he was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, a chemistry and physics teacher at David Starr Jordan High School in Watts.|$|E
5|$|Before {{heading out}} to a {{baseball}} game at a nearby ballpark, <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> Mr. Brown drinks several highball cocktails. He arrives at the ballpark to watch the game, but has become so inebriated that the game appears to him in reverse, with the players running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, Mr. Brown is escorted home {{by one of his}} friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend and proceeds to physically assault him, believing he is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.|$|E

He described Ernest Hemingway as his favorite writer, and enjoyed reading but was uninterested in music. A <b>sports</b> <b>fan,</b> he also spent much of his time trying to keep fit, undertaking regular exercise. He took a great interest in gastronomy, as well as wine and whisky, and as Cuban leader was known to wander into his kitchen to discuss cookery with his chefs.

25|$|In December, Canadian-born Sydney Newman {{arrived at}} BBC Television {{as the new}} Head of Drama. Newman was a science fiction fan who had overseen several such {{productions}} in his previous positions at ABC Television and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In March 1963, he was made aware by Baverstock – now promoted to Controller of Programmes – of {{a gap in the}} schedule on Saturday evenings between the sports showcase Grandstand and the pop music programme Juke Box Jury. Ideally, any programme scheduled here would appeal to children that had previously been accustomed to the timeslot; the teenaged audience of Juke Box Jury; and the adult <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> audience of Grandstand. Newman decided that a science fiction programme would be perfect to fill the gap, and enthusiastically took up the existing Script Department research, initiating several brainstorming sessions with Wilson, Braybon, Frick and another BBC staff writer, C. E. 'Bunny' Webber.|$|E
25|$|While seen as {{an enemy}} of the United States and Colombian governments, Escobar was a hero to many in Medellín (especially the poor people). He was a natural at public relations, and he worked to create {{goodwill}} among the poor of Colombia. A lifelong <b>sports</b> <b>fan,</b> he was credited with building football fields and multi-sports courts, as well as sponsoring children's football teams. Escobar was also responsible for the construction of houses and football fields in western Colombia, which gained him popularity among the poor. He worked hard to cultivate his Robin Hood image, and frequently distributed money through housing projects and other civic activities, which gained him notable popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented. Some people from Medellín often helped Escobar avoid police capture by serving as lookouts, hiding information from authorities, or doing whatever else they could to protect him. At the height of his power, drug traffickers from Medellín and other areas were handing over between 20% and 35% of their Colombian cocaine-related profits to Escobar, as {{he was the one who}} shipped cocaine successfully to the United States.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} {{magazines}} named Sports Illustrated {{before the current}} magazine began on August 16, 1954. In 1936, Stuart Scheftel created Sports Illustrated with a target market for the sportsman. He published the magazine from 1936 to 1938 on a monthly basis. The magazine was a life magazine size and focused on golf, tennis, and skiing with articles on the major sports. He then sold the name to Dell Publications, which released Sports Illustrated in 1949 and this version lasted 6 issues before closing. Dell's version focused on major sports (baseball, basketball, boxing) and competed on magazine racks against Sport and other monthly sports magazines. During the 1940s these magazines were monthly {{and they did not}} cover the current events because of the production schedules. There was no large-base, general, weekly sports magazine with a national following on actual active events. It was then that Time patriarch Henry Luce began considering whether his company should attempt to fill that gap. At the time, many believed sports was beneath the attention of serious journalism and did not think sports news could fill a weekly magazine, especially during the winter. A number of advisers to Luce, including Life magazine's Ernest Havemann, tried to kill the idea, but Luce, who was not a <b>sports</b> <b>fan,</b> decided the time was right.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to explore the multidimensional nature of sport team identification. More specifically, the study tested the psychometric {{properties}} of the Team Identification Scale (TIS) among Greek <b>sport</b> <b>fans</b> using a cross-validation approach. Following a thorough procedure, the TIS was initially translated and then validated using a sample of 327 Greek <b>sport</b> <b>fans.</b> Item meaning equivalence was also examined using a sample of 257 Australian <b>sport</b> <b>fans.</b> Results presented evidence regarding TIS's reliability, factorial validity, predictive efficacy and cross-national generalizability. It seems that the TIS is a valid tool for assessing the multidimensional nature of this construct among both English- and Greek-speaking populations...|$|R

After the tournament ended, they continued their conversation over dinner. Smith told Sobers that he was welcome to come back to Rhodesia whenever he liked. Sobers left the next day, after less than 48 hours in the country, and returned home to Barbados on 15 September 1970.|$|E
500|$|Dedicated {{to music}} education, Edwards enjoys {{conducting}} Beethoven for youth orchestras. He has {{admitted that he}} did not envision a career conducting youth orchestras but also that he [...] "did not rule them out". His favourite composition is Parsifal by Richard Wagner; other favourites include unaccompanied choral music, cello suites by Bach, quartets by Beethoven and jazz, including Nat King Cole. Apart from music, Edwards likes the Chicago Bears, CrossFit, golf, kayaking, Masterpiece Theater, poetry, and Rhône wine along with the winemaking process. Edwards is an avid <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> and fitness advocate; he is a former rugby player, enjoys running and playing squash, and believes there are similarities between how music and sports affect the community. He was sometimes referred to as [...] "coach" [...] by musicians of the Portland Youth Philharmonic. Edwards has shared that he would want to work at a vineyard or winery, or be a sports radio host or travel correspondent for a publication if he were not a conductor.|$|E

500|$|John Howard becomes {{leader of}} the Opposition, {{presenting}} a new threat to Keating. [...] Howard describes his intense desire for power and his thirst for revenge against the petty humiliations put on him {{as a child in}} a menacing minor-key march ("Power"). [...] However, in the media he presents himself as [...] "a normal bloke and nothing more" [...] ("The Mateship"). [...] Through various costume changes, he attempts to cast himself as a <b>sports</b> <b>fan,</b> a friend of the Australian soldier and a farmer, though the song implies that these are only costumes. [...] The song also refers to the [...] "children overboard" [...] affair, his criticism of political correctness, and his use of immigration as a political issue, some of which occurred after the actual Howard's subsequent election to Prime Minister. [...] In a slow rock duet, Keating and Howard both beseech voters to [...] "Choose Me". [...] However, as the 1996 electoral polls close, Keating concludes that he is doomed electorally. [...] He sings of his unachieved dreams and with some bitterness at what he sees as the backward-looking message of his opponent in a country-influenced ballad referring to former Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley's description of Labor's overarching goals ("The Light On The Hill").|$|E
500|$|It {{was first}} {{reported}} {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the 2010 Tour de France that Andy and Fränk Schleck would leave , the team for which they had each ridden for the entirety of their respective careers, at the conclusion of that season. It was soon revealed that they would spearhead a new team, one based in their native Luxembourg, led by former [...] staff Kim Andersen and Brian Nygaard. Luxembourg real estate tycoon Flavio Becca was eventually revealed as the team's owner. Andersen and Nygaard sought him out in May 2010 for advice. Becca, a <b>sports</b> <b>fan,</b> had plans to form a new cycling team himself, and he offered Nygaard the position of general manager for his team, essentially combining their ambitions. Becca also brought Andersen on, giving the Dane a position as a sporting director. Fränk Schleck later revealed that he and his brother had {{had little to do with}} the formation of the team, being approached with the prospect of joining at the 2010 Tour of Luxembourg in June. Despite a good relationship with [...] manager Bjarne Riis, the brothers felt the opportunity to ride for a [...] "home-based team" [...] was too good to pass up. Andersen made similar comments, saying that the team would have gone forward even if the Schleck brothers rode elsewhere in 2011.|$|E

In order to answer this question, 35 female <b>sport</b> <b>fans</b> who {{do not participate in}} fantasy sports were separated into five focus groups to provide the data necessary for this study. Seven themes emerged to explain why there is an under-representation of female participation in fantasy sports: lack of time, their friends do not play, negative associations, control versus escape, sport statistics, team versus player allegiances, and males acting as gatekeepers. Finally, four recommendations were made for those marketing fantasy sports to female sport fans: increase the overall awareness of fantasy sports, promote the social aspects of fantasy sports, streamline fantasy sports, and promote the ease of use...|$|R
