5|$|André 3000 and Big Boi met in 1992 at the Lenox Square {{shopping}} mall {{when they were}} both 16 years old. The two lived in the East Point section of Atlanta and attended Tri-Cities High School. During school, they participated in rap battles in the cafeteria. André 3000 {{dropped out of high school}} at age 17 and worked a series of jobs before he and Big Boi formed a group called 2 Shades Deep; he returned to obtain his GED at a night school following the release of Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. They briefly dabbled in street-hustling to <b>save</b> <b>up</b> for recording money.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his artistic}} talents, Kim's main {{interest}} was medicine, and {{he applied for}} entrance into medical school upon graduation {{from high school in}} 1940. When he failed to gain admittance, Kim moved to Japan, planning to study and <b>save</b> <b>up</b> money to reapply for medical school. The theater and cinema grew into lifetime interests at this time. Kim often went to Kyoto, where he attended many stage productions and saw many international films. Josef von Sternberg's Morocco (1930) and Fritz Lang's M (1931) made a particularly strong impression on him, and their influence was to show in his mature film style.|$|E

His wife and daughter know nothing of what has befallen him and struggle to live in the city. The daughter gets a position in a sweatshop, and her eyesight deteriorates until she is unable to work anymore.

5|$|Everyone in {{the family}} has to create budget cuts in their daily routine, such as Homer having {{to give up on}} buying beer and Marge having to cook with lower-quality food and forgo her weekly lottery ticket. Bart must get his hair cut at a local barber school, Lisa can no longer get her volumes of Encyclopedia Generica, and Maggie's clothes have to last a little bit longer. They {{eventually}} <b>save</b> <b>up</b> enough money for the operation, which is a success. The family is joyous that their dog is well again, but soon begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices. As a result, the morale of the family suffers and they take their annoyance out on Santa's Little Helper. Feeling unwanted, he runs away from home and goes off on an adventure, only to be captured, taken to the dog pound, and adopted by Mr. Burns, who trains him to be one of his vicious attack hounds. After a long brainwashing process, consisting of the Ludovico technique, Santa's Little Helper is turned into a bloodthirsty killer.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3 {{contains}} non-gameplay additions, such as Forge, a map-editing tool. Forge enables {{players to}} insert and remove game objects, such as weapons, crates and vehicles into existing multiplayer maps.

A budget limits the amount of objects that can be placed. Players may also <b>save</b> <b>up</b> to 100 films of gameplay to their Xbox 360's hard drive, viewing the action from any angle and at different speeds. Halo 3 offers a form of file sharing, where items such as saved films, screenshots, and custom variants can all be uploaded to Bungie's official website, Bungie.net. Anyone can browse user created content that has been uploaded to Bungie's website and tag it to automatically download to their console next time they sign into Xbox Live on Halo 3.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the two new cups, {{it is also possible}} to create custom cups. The disk can <b>save</b> <b>up</b> to a hundred tracks and up to three ghost racers per course. IGN singled out the track creator as the F-Zero X Expansion Kits strongest feature since it is virtually the same tool the designers of F-Zero X used for themselves to create the original circuits. The Car Editor offers a variety of options when creating a vehicle. Using a set of pre-existing parts, the player must balance their creations' settings and performance abilities before the machine is finished and named. The Track Editor is a detailed track creator that allows the player to design their own racing circuits. Using a cursor, the player can determine the basic layout of the track and also add points to it to create track elements such as curves and hills. Furthermore, numerous different properties like half pipes and cylinders, as well as numerous road surfaces, such as slip zones, can be added. The player can test the creation at any time and run practice laps.|$|E

25|$|Historian J.M. Andre {{concludes that}} the {{original}} sense of otium was related to military service and the idleness {{that happened in the}} winter, as opposed to the business (negotium) {{of the rest of the}} year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual otium. Andre shows that the beauty of the individual otium poses rest. Titus Maccius Plautus in his play Mercator says that while you are young is the time to <b>save</b> <b>up</b> for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).|$|E

25|$|CPR has {{continued}} to advance, with recent developments including an emphasis on constant, rapid heart stimulation, without respiration. Studies have shown that people who had rapid, constant hands-only chest compression 22% more likely to survive than those receiving conventional, CPR that included breathing. What's more, because {{people tend to be}} reluctant to do mouth-to-mouth, chest-only CPR nearly doubles the chances of survival overall, by increasing the odds of receiving CPR in the first place. An analysis of 3,700 cardiac arrests published Friday in the journal Lancet found that hands-only CPR saved 22% more lives than the conventional method. All told, the switch could <b>save</b> <b>up</b> to 3,000 additional lives a year in the USA and 5,000 to 10,000 in North America and Europe, says lead author Peter Nagele of Washington University in St. Louis.|$|E
25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would <b>save</b> <b>up</b> his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, he would tell him that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next time you come around. And Amsaalih would let him do that. At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E
25|$|Countries where {{fixed rate}} loans are the {{common form of}} loan for a house {{purchase}} usually {{need to have a}} specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular Bausparkassen, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to <b>save</b> <b>up</b> a considerable amount, at a rather low fixed interest rate, before they get their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before actually getting the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; {{it has to be done}} in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the monthly payment is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the loan is also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in which you have to start making payments several years before actually getting the loan, is mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime home buyers who are able to plan ahead for a long time. That has become a problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.|$|E
