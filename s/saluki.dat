5|$|The {{popularity}} of the <b>Saluki</b> in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club, has remained relatively stable over the past decade, with the breed ranked 107th in 1999, had decreased to 118th in 2008, but by 2008 had increased once again to 112th. Between 2000 and 2009, 1215 Salukis were registered with The Kennel Club in the UK, while this does not approach the numbers {{of the more popular}} breeds, it is in line with similar breeds in the Hound Group such as the Borzoi, which had 1399 puppies registered in the same period. In September 2007, The Kennel Club Art Gallery's 12th exhibition celebrated the <b>Saluki,</b> The <b>Saluki</b> in Art showed a range of exhibits including terracotta and bronze works, along with contemporary artists and a range of trophies from <b>Saluki</b> breed clubs.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Salukis {{were used}} for hunting by nomadic tribes. Typical quarry {{included}} the gazelle, hare, fox and jackal. While hunting hares, Bedouin hunters would sometimes ride close to their quarry on a camel holding a <b>Saluki,</b> which would be thrown towards the prey while at speed to give the dog a running start. Gazelle hunters also used hawks to gouge out {{the eyes of the}} prey so that a <b>Saluki</b> could then bring down the blinded animal.|$|E
5|$|The modern <b>Saluki</b> has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed {{may be difficult}} to train. Training methods should always be gentle and patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The <b>Saluki</b> does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|E

The <b>Salukis</b> would not place again in the following 3 tournament appearances in 1947, 1948, 1960.|$|R
5|$|From Europe, {{the legend}} {{maintains}} that the returning crusaders brought the <b>Saluki</b> back from the Middle East. The painting of Henry IV, Duke of Saxony with his hunting dog, painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder in 1514, is thought by some to show a <b>Saluki.</b> The dog wears a collar decorated with a scallop shell, which is the badge of a pilgrim who has traveled the Way of Saint James in Spain. Salukis appear in Paolo Veronese's 1573 work The Adoration of the Magi (also known as the Adoration of the Kings), currently located at the National Gallery, London. Veronese painted the breed in another two of his religious paintings: The Marriage at Cana and The Finding of Moses.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Saluki</b> was {{historically}} bred in the Fertile Crescent where agriculture originated. Images {{of running}} dogs with long, narrow bodies adorn pottery found in Susa {{that dates back}} to 6,000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia, with one writer suggesting that these might depict the ancestor of the <b>Saluki,</b> despite the depictions bearing erect, pointed ears. Salukis and Greyhounds were increasingly depicted on Egyptian tombs from the Middle Kingdom (2134 BC–1785 BC) onward, however it was during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt that Salukis rose to prominence, replacing the Tesem (thought to be similar to modern Pariah dogs or a generic term for a dog) in ancient Egyptian art. The breed spread southward into the Sudan.|$|E
5|$|Popularity of Salukis {{dramatically}} increased, and the <b>Saluki</b> Club of America {{was founded}} in 1927, Salukis were recognized by The Kennel Club in 1923, and by the American Kennel Club in 1929. The breed is also the mascot of Southern Illinois University Carbondale.|$|E

50|$|Dieker {{continued}} his football career at Southern Illinois. Dieker was a 4-year starter for the <b>Salukis,</b> going 20-9 during that time.

5|$|The overall {{appearance}} of the <b>Saluki</b> is one of grace and symmetry. Two coat types—smooth and feathered—are evident in the breed's gene pool. The latter variety has light feathering {{on the back of}} the legs and thighs. The fur on both types is silky and is low-shedding when compared to other breeds.|$|E
5|$|English Salukis (chiefly {{descendants}} of Sarona Kelb) were exported to many countries, {{but by the}} mid-1930s, interest slackened, and with the outbreak of World War II, breeding and show activities almost entirely stopped. The number of litters was minimal – just {{enough to keep the}} breed alive. Food rationing reserved all edible meat for humans, and to prevent the Salukis from dying from starvation or being killed by bombs, some owners euthanized entire kennels. A small number of <b>Saluki</b> kennels survived the war, and along with fresh imports belonging to a second wave of soldiers returning from the Middle East, the slow process of re-establishing the breed began again.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1840, that the Salukis were first brought to England. Referred to as Slughis, they and the modern Sloughi were treated as the same breed; however, recent genetic tests {{have shown that the}} two breeds are genetically separate. The first {{successful}} modern breeding line of Salukis began in 1895, with Florence Amherst (daughter of the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney). Having seen Salukis on a Nile tour in that year, she imported a breeding pair from the Al Salihah area of Lower Egypt. A champion of breed purity, she struggled alone for nearly three decades, and real <b>Saluki</b> popularity did not take hold until the early 1920s, when officers returning from the war in the Middle East and the Arab Revolt brought their pet Salukis home with them.|$|E

25|$|The Khalag Tazi is {{a variety}} of the Afghan. It was {{introduced}} to Europe in 1920 when an Indian Army officer, Major G Bell-Murray, brought some animals back from Afghanistan.

It {{has been used to}} denote the <b>Saluki,</b> Afghan, Taigan, Persian Greyhound, greyhound types of hound.|$|E
25|$|It {{was long}} thought that <b>Saluki</b> type sighthounds were {{originally}} brought to Russia from Byzantium in the South about the 9th and 10th centuries and again {{later by the}} Mongol invaders from the East. However, now that the archeological archives and research results of the former USSR are open to scientists, it has become quite clear that the primal sighthound type evolved between the Kyrgyzstan, the lower Kazakhstan part of Altai and the Afghan plains, and that the earliest actual sighthound breeds were the plains Afghan hounds and the Kyrgyz Taigan.|$|E
25|$|Dogs {{were used}} as {{domestic}} pets, guardians, herders, and police assistants. Several dog breeds {{could be found in}} ancient Egypt, the most popular being the greyhound, basenji, and <b>saluki,</b> all very good for hunting. From the First Dynasty, Egyptians venerated several jackal deities, with the most prominent one was of Anubis. He was represented as a canine or a canine headed human. Traditionally, the Anubis animal has been identified as a jackal, but its generally black coloring, symbolic of the afterlife and rebirth, is not typical of jackals and may instead denote a wild dog. Because dogs and jackals roamed the desert's edge, where the dead were generally buried, they were seen as protectors of cemeteries.|$|E
