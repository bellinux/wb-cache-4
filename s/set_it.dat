5|$|Baseball {{has certain}} {{attributes}} that <b>set</b> <b>it</b> {{apart from the}} other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none {{of them is the}} variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{extensive}} coastal defences erected by the Germans {{to protect the}} installation from a seaborne raid, {{it was believed that}} a commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for the garrison at the installation to destroy the Würzburg radar <b>set.</b> <b>It</b> was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation would be the most practicable way to surprise the garrison of the installation, seize the technology intact, and minimise casualties to the raiding force.|$|E

5|$|Madonna: An Intimate Biography {{is a book}} by American author J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{chronicling the}} life of American singer Madonna. The book was {{released}} in April 2001 by Sidgwick & Jackson in the United Kingdom, and in August 2001 by Simon & Schuster in the United States. Taraborrelli first considered writing the book in 1990, but, realizing the project might be premature in respect to Madonna's fledgling career, <b>set</b> <b>it</b> aside. He began writing the book in 1996, when Madonna {{gave birth to her}} daughter Lourdes.|$|E
5|$|Scouting {{virtually}} started itself, but {{the trigger}} that <b>set</b> <b>it</b> going was the 1908 publication of Scouting for Boys written by Robert Baden-Powell. At Charterhouse, one of England's most famous public schools, Baden-Powell {{had an interest}} in the outdoors. Later, as a military officer, Baden-Powell was stationed in British India in the 1880s where he took an interest in military scouting and in 1884 he published Reconnaissance and Scouting.|$|E
5|$|Shapur I {{destroyed}} the Palmyrene trade colonies {{all along the}} Euphrates (including the colonies at Anah in 253 and at Dura-Europos in 256); Peter the Patrician says that Odaenathus approached Shapur to negotiate Palmyrene interests but was rebuffed and the gifts sent to the Persians were thrown into the river. The date for the attempted negotiations is debated; Some scholars including John F. Drinkwater set the event in 253 while others such as Alaric Watson <b>set</b> <b>it</b> in 256 following the destruction of Dura-Europos.|$|E

5|$|The final Delrina-branded {{version of}} WinFax was WinFax PRO 7.0, which shipped in late 1995, the {{subsequent}} version 8.0 being a Symantec product. There was no intervening version 5.0 or 6.0, and the jump to version 7.0 was purely a marketing decision, based on {{keeping up with}} the suite of products in Microsoft Office which were then at the same number. It also reflected the development effort required to develop the first full 32-bit application version, designed to work with the Windows 95 operating system, which <b>set</b> <b>it</b> apart from its competition at the time.|$|E
5|$|The schoolhouse {{was built}} in 1883, {{in the village of}} Chana, Illinois. Due to the {{elimination}} of the Chana School District, the school was abandoned by the 1960s.

Its interior also features architectural elements which <b>set</b> <b>it</b> apart from the typical 19th-century schoolhouse. From a distance, the building is dominated by its bell tower.|$|E
