The footbridge is used to connect two separate buildings (buildings D and Z at the Faculty of Civil Engineering Brno University of Technology). Four variants have been designed about solutions supporting steel structure. The final variant was prepared in detail and was carried out static assessment of the individual elements and selected details. The main supporting structure of this variant are two trusses. Diagonals of these trusses are designed linkage system of Macalloy 460. Bridge deck is designed of composite steel a concrete board with crossbars. The footbridge is designed as simple beam with an overhanging end. Length span is 34. 8 m, length overhanging ends is 5. 8 meters. The total length of the footbridge is 40. 6 meters.

40|$|The {{research}} hereinafter describes aims at mechanically {{characterize the}} behavior of timber framed buildings, with particular focus on their behaviour in seismic zones. An extensive experimental campaign divided into three phases has been completed {{in order to achieve}} this objective. In the first phase tests on the connection between <b>sheating</b> panels and timber studs were conducted. Subsequently {{the behavior of}} the connections used for anchoring the walls to the foundation were investigated. In the second stage the full scale timber framed walls were subjected to tests. The walls were realized using different materials and different type of connections to the ground. The results have allowed the study of the individual structural components which constitute an entire building, from the single connector to the entire wall. In order to understand the behavior of the components themselves in a real building, and thus their interaction with each other in case of an earthquake, in the third step a shaking table test of a three-story building has been done. All tests have permitted to collect a wealth of data with which to populate a database to be used both to understand in detail the structural behavior of the timber framed building system and in also to validate the proposed formulations. From the analytical point of view, an equation able to provide the horizontal displacement of a wall subject to a horizontal force has been developed. This equation was then successfully validated by comparing the results with those obtained from laboratory tests. For the execution of the tests have been created procedures and set-up ad hoc, that could be used also in the future to carry out similar tests. An important work has been done to achieve a configuration suitable to test full scale timber framed walls through well controlling the boundary conditions...|$|E

The present study is dedicated to the presentation of a methodology allowing to realise a comparative life cycle assessment of several materials used to build exterior walls. The main objective is to compare several materials necessary to its construction, in order to use their environmental footprint as main choice criterion. The comparison is done by studying several constitutive elements of the wall, each component having a distinctive function (e. g. : thermal or acoustic insulation, fire resistance). This facilitates, beside the decisions taking, in optimizing the materials flows, their life duration or the durability of such a structure. Are considered in the study the components classically presented in an exterior wall : the external cladding, the water resistant membrane and <b>sheating,</b> the framing (main structure), the insulation, the vapor barrier and the interior finishing. The obtained results show on one part which are the more "impacting" materials {{and on the other side}} which is the lifecycle step having a major contribution on these impacts. It is then easy to observe that the impacts diminution in the end of life can increase them during the manufacturing step. Actuellement, l'analyse du cycle de vie (ACV) est un outil largement employé pour quantifier les conséquences environnementales des produits. Cette méthodologie s'applique aux procédés industriels et aux services, grâce à la possibilité d'intégrer la majorité des paramètres intervenant sur l'ensemble des étapes de leur cycle de vie. La présente étude est dédiée à la présentation d'une méthodologie permettant de mener à bien une analyse comparative des divers matériaux entrant dans la composition d'un élément de construction de type mur extérieur. Le but est de comparer différents matériaux nécessaires à la construction du mur pour utiliser comme critère de choix leur empreinte environnementale. Cette comparaison est faite sur les différents éléments constitutifs du mur, dont chacun a une fonction distincte (ex. : isolation thermique ou acoustique, résistance au feu, etc.). Ceci peut faciliter, outre la prise de décisions en termes de choix de matériaux de construction, l'optimisation des flux de matières, de leur durée de vie, ainsi que la durabilité d'une telle structure. On considère dans l'étude les éléments classiquement présents dans un mur extérieur : le bardage, le pare-pluie et la structure, l'ossature, l'isolation, le pare-vapeur et la finition intérieure. Les résultats obtenus montrent d'une part quels sont les matériaux les plus « impactants » et d'autre part quelle est l'étape de leur cycle de vie majoritairement contributrice sur ces impacts. On peut ainsi observer que la diminution des impacts en fin de vie peut engendrer leur augmentation au niveau de la fabrication.

40|$|Background/Aim. Vasculitis is a clinical, {{pathologic}} process {{characterized by}} inflammation and necrosis of blood vessel occurring {{anywhere in the}} body. The aim {{of the study was}} to present some clinical and immunologic features of retinal vasculitis in systemic diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, Behcet's diseases, and others. Methods. A total of 1 254 patients with uveitis were included in the study. The immunochemical diagnostic methods were used to determine the pathogenesis of ocular manifestations. Ocular manifestations were examined using biomicroscope, direct or indirect ophtalmoscopy. Results. Primary retinal vasculitis was diagnosed in 85 / 1254 (6. 8 %) of total uveitis. In more than half of the cases of vasculitis (58. 8 %), both arteries and veins were involved in inflammatory process. Periphlebitis was diagnosed far more commonly (36. 5 %) than periarteritis (4. 7 %). Retinal vasculitis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus was characterized by microinfarctions and the consequent foci of inflammatory cells or diseases of large arteries manifesting in vasospasm and occlusions. Cotton wool spots occurred in 38. 3 % and retinal hemorrhages in 34 % of the cases. In this study periphlebitis of the retina was one of the less frequent ocular manifestations of multiple sclerosis. Comparing with the other changes of the retinal blood vessels, venous <b>sheating</b> occurred in 25. 1 % and occlusion and vein trombosis in 43. 75 % of the cases. Retinal vasculitis associated with chronic sarcoidosis occured in 37. 5 % of patients with sarcoidosis. The most frequent manifestation of ocular sarcoidosis was intermediary uveitis (43. 75 %). Anterior granulomatous uveitis occured in 37. 5 % of patients with sarcoidoses. Immune complexes occurred in 13 / 20 (65 %) of the patients. Antiretinal anti-S antibody in the serum occurred in 73 % of the patients with retinal detachment as a complication of primary disease and in 25 % those with vasculitis. Conclusion. Systemic diseases such as Behcet's syndrome, collagen vascular diseases, systemic granulomatous diseases (sarcoidosis and tuberculosis) were the main causes of retinal vasculitis. Knowledge of the symptomatology and pathogenesis of retinal vasculitis is of the major significance for the diagnosis and therapy of the disease...|$|E
