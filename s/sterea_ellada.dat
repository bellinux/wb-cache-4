50|$|Colchicum parnassicum is a {{plant species}} endemic to the <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada</b> region of central Greece. It {{is closely related}} to Colchicum autumnale, mainly being {{different}} in having shorter flowers. The blooms are produced in fall and have a medium pink colour. The flowers hold up well in fall weather. This species, if cultivated in cold climates, it will do better in a sunny, sheltered location.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} and pilot application of innovative methods {{in the field}} of cultural heritage can {{have a significant effect on}} local development by boosting tourism and the related economic activities, increasing familiarity with new technologies and creating a sense of local pride. The five Centres for Heritage Interpretation that were developed in the Region of <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada</b> within the framework of the RI-SE Innovative Actions Programme offer a good example of this process, illustrating the contribution of innovation to local development and the integral role played by the Local Authorities. This paper aims to examine the role of cultural innovation in local and regional development, mainly through the promotion of cultural tourism. The use of new technologies in the interpretation of cultural heritage upgrades the services provided to the visitors of cultural sites and can promote archaeological and historic monuments and sites that are less known to the wide public, therefore channeling the flow of tourists to under-developed areas of a Region. Furthermore, it is a means of introducing new technologies and innovation in a way that is user-friendly and appealing, regardless of the user’s degree of familiarity with information technology. The European Regional Innovation (RI-SE) Programme for <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada,</b> was implemented in 2003 - 2004, and aimed to introduce and incorporate innovation in the region’s economic and cultural activities through the provision of new services and the utilization of high technology. Within the framework of this programme, five pilot Centres for Heritage Interpretation were established in the towns of Orchomenos, Lamia, Gravia, Karystos and Fragista, in close collaboration with the respective Municipalities. The case study will examine the methodology and criteria that were used for the selection of the specific heritage sites from the plethora of monuments of the <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada</b> Region. It will also present the different multimedia solutions that were employed in each case and outline the reception of the Centres by the public. In addition, it will focus on the contribution of the Municipalities to the success of the project and analyze its effects on local development, both in the specific Municipalities, but also in the entire Region. Finally, the project’s demonstration effect will be evaluated and the prospects of its implementation in other Regions and other countries will be considered: the RI-SE programme developed an innovative model that can easily and successfully be adapted and implemented in every country with a rich cultural heritage (like, for example, in the Mediterranean countries: Spain, Italy, Turkey), especially in areas that are not included in major tourist routes. ...|$|E
40|$|Next year (2007) is {{expected}} to be a milestone for the regional policy of Greece. For the first time since the EU launched the programmes which are co-funded by the Structural Funds, Greek regions are excluded from the Objective 1 â€œConvergenceâ€ programmes of the 2007 - 2013 programming period. Two regions, <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada</b> and Southern Aegean have been included in the phasing - in group of NUTS II regions which are falling under the new â€œRegional Competitiveness and Employmentâ€ objective since they have exceeded the 75 % boundary of the GDP per capita of the EU both in relation with the older 15 and the 25 current member states. Hence, apart from the reduction funding compared to the current period, they are obliged to redefine their developmental priorities and to adjust the programming context according to the new circumstances in line with the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives. Within this context the preparation calls for the adjustment to the new circumstances and the exploration of the most efficient way to continue and empower the developmental path. In addition to these, some important matters such as the actual developmental position of these regions, the sectors where cohesion hasn’t been achieved, the new challenges and the experience that has been gained and to what extent it is being used as a learning process have to be explored The article aims to contribute to the ongoing conversation regarding the ways by which <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada</b> and Southern Aegean regions can utilize the Structural Funds in the new programming period, based on their experience until today, but also on the possibilities which they are being offered as â€œphasing – inâ€ regions of the â€œCompetitiveness and Employmentâ€ objective according to the new context of regional policy. To these directions, the general outlines of the future perspectives of the regional priorities of the European Union will be presented initially, both for the current and the next programming period. A comparative description of the socio-economic position of the two regions within the European Union is given next, followed by a discussion of the current programming experience and some implementation issues and lessons learnt. Finally, suggestions and some policy priorities as well as the conclusions of the analysis will be presented. ...|$|E
40|$|Transhumance connects {{highlands}} and lowlands creating {{that way}} a farming system with important social, cultural, economic, landscape and environmental effects. Despite the continuous {{reduction of the}} number of transhumant herds in Greece the later years, this farming system still preserves a considerable position in country’s animal husbandry. Aim of this paper is the study of management practices and the nomination of productivity indicators of the transhumant reared animals in the region of <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada.</b> The necessary data were collected through a specially conducted questionnaire from totally 140 transhumant herders. The results reveal average herd size of 364. 40, with herd sizes that excides one thousand, especially for goat herds, and residence on mountainous, semi-mountainous areas for at least 5 months. The main source of income is the trade of milk, but {{it should be noted that}} a small proportion of the herders process milk and trade only feta and/or other traditional kinds of cheese complementary of meat trade. In addition average traded milk production and prolificacy reveal the influence of more intense farming practices, such as crossbreeding and/or rational feed and the continuous effort of the producers and correspond to consecutive increase of the needs of the market...|$|E
40|$|Transhumance is the {{seasonal}} movement of herds between different {{summer and winter}} pastures. The main reason of practice of this farming system {{is the need for}} a more efficient exploitation of vegetation to meet the nutritional needs of the reared animals. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate nutritional management practices of transhumant herds in the region of <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada.</b>   In the analysis, emphasis is given in the calculation of the coverage of nutritional needs of the reared animals by supplementary feed, translated as Metabolized energy (ME), Digestible Crude Protein (DGP) and Dry Matter (DM). Nutritional management is studied in four basic productive stages of ewes and dams. All necessary data were collected from a sample of 140 transhumant herders, via an exhaustive questionnaire that covered all aspects of the production of the farms and managerial practices. Data were subsequently analyzed with descriptive statistic methods. Analysis reveals that grazing tends to be the main nutritional source as approximately 30 - 50 % of the needs of the reared animals on lowlands and more than 90 % on uplands is considered to be covered by grazin...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{its long}} {{history from the}} fifth century B. C. until today, the city of Athens managed to satisfy a {{gradually}} increasing urban demand for water supply with reserves obtained by the diversion of fresh-water. At first, the water was displaced from the adjacent territories and with time from more distant basins, extending the water imprint of the city on its hinterland. This article traces {{the history of the}} development of successive water supply infrastructures, which has resulted in the current situation where Athens controls a significant amount of the water reserves of two (in a total of fourteen) Greek River Basin Districts (Attica and Western <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada).</b> With the exception of a short period of drought (1989 - 1993), no serious effort has ever been made by the decision makers to slow down the increase of urban per capita consumption in the city. The water imprint of Athens is also linked to the disposal of wastewater in the coastal waters of the Saronic Gulf, since wastewater treatment has been established from 1985 onwards. New lines of thinking are suggested for meeting the needs of the still-growing city of Athens without further increasing its water imprint. © Springer-Verlag 2012...|$|E
40|$|The {{efforts of}} the European Commission to reduce {{regional}} inequalities over its territory continue {{to attract the attention}} of researchers. The purpose of this paper is to perform an exploratory investigation of the relationship between the spatial distribution of regional income and of regional development funds among 145 European regions over 1989 - 1999. Using a set of tools of spatial statistics, we first detect the presence of global and local spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of regional per capita incomes, traducing that rich (poor) regions tend to be clustered close to other rich (poor) regions, and in the distribution of regional growth rate and regional funds. Second, the results of LISA statistics conclude to the presence of spatial heterogeneity in the form of two spatial clusters of rich and poor regions over the decade, highlighting the persistence of a significant core-periphery pattern among European regions. Finally, an exploratory analysis reveals a negative correlation between growth and initial income, that tends to indicate β-convergence. A positive relationship between regional growth and structural funds is identified among the significant results as well. Only Andalucia, Galicia and <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada</b> show atypical linkages. These results suggest that further research should include spatial effects and the distribution of regional funds in the spatial econometric estimation of regional convergence in Europe. © Springer-Verlag 2005...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. In this study, {{we carried}} out direct and {{indirect}} surveys in 30 Greek areas to clarify {{the current status of}} the Balkan chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra balcanica). It is an important flagship species for conservation in Greece, protected by both National and European legislation. New chamois populations are recorded {{for the first time in}} 3 areas, direct sightings of chamois are found in 11 areas, and presence is reported by locals in a further 4 areas. The overall potential distribution area of the species is 1. 663 km 2. The chamois is considered extinct in 6 areas and its presence is doubtful in the remaining 6 areas. Chamois have a frag-mented dispersal pattern in Greece and three blocks of populations are distinguished: Pindus, <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada</b> and Rhodopi popula-tions. Population sizes do not usually exceed 30 individuals in each area, and the maximum population size recorded is 120 - 130 individuals (Mt. Timfi). Our preliminary estimate of the total Greek population size is between 477 and 750, which is slightly higher than previous estimates. Although most sites are within established reserves, protected by the Natura 2000 network, there is an urgent need for further conservation measures. Poaching is considered to be the major threat to this species, therefore effective protection is urgently needed, through the enhancement of guarding system against poaching, the control of roads usage within its core range, and the creation of protected natural corridors between chamois populations...|$|E
40|$|The EU support {{regime is}} centred on a {{production}} aid per tonne of unginned cotton within national guaranteed quantities. Aid is granted to processors, who pay a minimum price to growers, {{based on the}} difference between the 'guide price' and the world price. Since 1995 / 96 the 'guide price' has been set at € 1, 063 per tonne with a guaranteed minimum price of € 1, 009. 9 per tonne. Greece has a NGQ of 782, 000 tonnes, Spain an NGQ of 249, 000 tonnes and other member states a total of 1, 500 tonnes. EU support to the cotton sector totalled € 773 million in 2001. The cotton sector contributes only 0. 5 % to final agricultural output in the EU, but is important in certain EU regions (Thessaly, Macedonia-Thrace, <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada</b> and Andalusia. For example in Greece, cotton represent 9 % of total agricultural output. In these areas cotton is farmed by small holders. The area under cotton however is decreasing. At a world level the EU is a minor producer, contributing only 2. 2 % of total production (the USA by contrast accounts for 20. 1 % of world production). The EU exports some 227, 000 tonnes of ginned cotton and is a major net exporter of ginned cotton. The USA however dominates world cotton exports, accounting for 30 % of world trade (west Africa accounts for only about 11 %). The EU consumes about 1 million tonnes of ginned cotton per annum. Comment: The guaranteed minimum price system means that regardless of the world market price EU cotton growers receive over € 1, 000 per tonne for their cotton. This insulates EU producers entirely from the low world market prices for cotton which have plagued west African cotton producers. Since 2000 EU imports of cotton have declined as EU production and exports have increased (despite a 13. 5 % decline in the price of ginned cotton). This demonstrates the extent to which production and trade in cotton in the EU is insulated from developments on world markets. The EU support regime is centred on a production aid per tonne of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{considers}} the extractive activities of magnesite in North Euboea, which politically and geographically {{belongs to the}} region of <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada,</b> with particular emphasis on the mines of today’s Municipality of Elimnion. My main motivation for focusing on this region was the presence of many industrial buildings and other interspersed national-archaeological sites – they demonstrate to a visitor the strong interest in mining and metallurgy. Additionally, they serve {{as a reminder of}} the “Industrial Revolution” that the region went through a long time ago. My previous experiences of industrial buildings and national-archaeological sites led me to the assumption that the extensive extractive and mining workings in the region have historical value. Every historian could find in these a precious source of information for the period of industrial development and extractive activity that took place in Greece during the 19 th and 20 th century – a period that, in this context, is almost unknown and, to date, overlooked by historical research. The existing Greek and foreign literature which has been the basis of my research appears not to reference, and therefore ignore, North Euboea and its contribution to the Greek industrialisation. This realisation strengthened my intention to repair the historical injustice – although the absence of data was a constant obstacle to my research. Nonetheless, the rich archival material of the Limni Local Archive and the Monastery of Galataki compensated for the poor bibliographic support. This primary material, which is mostly unpublished, combined with oral evidence recently collected from the very few old metallurgists, enabled me to establish a more complete picture of the life and the general organisation in the region around the mines of Limni. My research is an attempt to compose the chronicle of this important period for the mining history of Greece by focusing on how the exploitation of magnesite started, on it’s systemisation and slow removal from Limni, and, most importantly, on the study of the consequences for the local societies that supported it. At the foot of Kandili mountain (1. 225 meters) in North Euboea where the Municipality of Elimnion meets with the Municipalities of Kireas and Nileas, the land held a gift of nature for its inhabitants with strong impact on the economic, social, cultural and environmental stability of the region. It was the Euboean magnesite, which {{can be found in the}} borders of those three neighbouring Municipalities. It was a Greek El Dorado, a mining delirium that started raving from the 19 th century in the mines of Psili Rahi, Archagelos and Kakavos where innumerable metallurgists hoped to obtain wealth quickly...|$|E
40|$|The popular {{biography}} of a saint, often {{different from the}} one of his/her official Life of a Saint, is very interesting {{for the study of the}} religious folklore and the fuller understanding of the traditional cultural system of a people, since it constitutes an important source of information as far as the perceptions of the simple people and the traditional religious behavior are concerned. The subject of the present study is the imprinting and the study of those elements that constitute the popular narrative tradition of St. John the Kalyvitis, elements that are in-topic relevant to those of his ecclesiastic Life and which are indivisibly bound to the cultural life of the places that reproduce them. The present thesis is the result of a long research and study. There was a before-hand detailed research and collection of information from documentary sources and the relevant bibliography, both Greek and international, in studies and in the archives of Universities and research centers, in conjunction with on-site folkloric research in various places of worship of St. John the Kalyvitis, where the method of recorded interview was applied. In specific, during the period 1994 - 2002, there was systematic on-site research and documentation of the popular narrative accounts that involved St. John the Kalyvitis in the following regions of Greece: Euboea (Bathi, Kastella, Mantoudi, Politika, Prokopi, Psahna), Thessaly (Magnesia), Ionian Islands (Corfu), Crete (Chania, Siteia), Cyclades (Kea, Paros, Tinos), Lesbos (Mytilene, Plomari, Batera), Macedonia (Florina), Peloponnesus (Achaia, Messinia) and <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada</b> (Attica, Fthiotida, Fokida). The primary folkloric material of these documentations, in conjunction with the reading and evaluation of archive records, books and scientific journals consisted the basic body of my thesis which aimed at this very thing, that is the collection, classification and interpretation of the unpublished and published relevant material. Methodological support was provided by other relevant studies as well. 1 The book is divided into three chapters and includes preface, introduction, conclusion, glossary, bibliography (and appendix of tradition documents). In the first chapter, the official ecclesiastic {{biography of}} St. John the Kalyvitis is put forward, as well as his hymnographic and hagiographic elements. In the second chapter, the geographic breadth and the distribution of the popular narrations concerning St. John in the entire Greek continental and insular territory, Cyprus and Asia Minor are exposed. In the third chapter, a thorough analysis and interpretation of the popular tradition of St. John the Kalyvitis is attempted, particularly its connection with the official ecclesiastic tradition, the ancient classical history and mythology, and the fairytale types of the Greek as well as the international paramythology. The conclusions follow. In a special appendix in the end, the texts of unpublished fairytales and traditions of the saint, references to the live of the informants and special records and documents from the archives of the temple of. St. John the Kalyvitis in Euboea (Bathi) are exhibited. [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{nationwide}} violent riots by {{youths and}} the general strike in December 2008 in Greece happened in a country, which according to the financial expenses paid by Brussels should be a real showcase of the European model. A quick glance at the statistics of the net recipient countries of the EU budget teaches us that not the poor new member states in {{the east of the}} continent, but Greece is one of the prime recipients all financial transfers from Brussels over the last decades. From 2003 to 2006 paid Brussels paid net to Greece 16. 5 billion Euros (net), and Greece should be a real model of social coherence, and Lisbon-strategy progress towards a dynamic, knowledge-based society, etc. The apocalyptic pictures of the unrests in this key country in the EU are all the more alarming, because Greece {{is a member of the}} Union already since 1981. Greece in January 1981 became the tenth State of the European Community. On 6 November 1992, Greece became a member of Schengen, and from 1. 1. 2001, Greece is also a member of the European Monetary Union. In many respects, Greece was an EU model pupil. Its Eurobarometer consent for the European Constitution was 78 % - the highest among all member states. The Accession Treaty with the ten new EU member states on 16 April 2003 was signed in Athens as the birthplace of democracy. The devastating forest fires of 2007 heralded the need for a rethinking of the "Greek model". More than 190 fires were reported and more than 70 fatalities were counted. The far-reaching consequences of this major fire disaster for the climate of the region are still unclear. Large stretches of land in the west and southwest look like volcano - or lunar landscapes. Many of these fires had their origins in negligence or even criminal arson for the benefit of land speculation. With the current collapse of the Greek model also a neo-liberal success story comes to end. The neo-liberal government of Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis has been in office since September 2007. Focus of the Karamanlis government is the restructuring of social security, a balanced budget, combating unemployment, the reform of education, including through licensing of private universities, and health care reform along neo-liberal policy prescriptions. The key points of government activity were • deregulation and cutting red tape • privatization projects • selling shares in the state's largest telephone company on the stock market The current experience of Greece has a disturbing lesson for the further convergence and integration process of the neighbouring states. Even more alarming than the standstill of the convergence process are unmistakable signs that this EU core member state is confronted with corruption out of control. According to Transparency International Greece only holds rank 57 in global corruption control, and the worst EU 27 Country Bulgaria is even ranked 72 nd. Numerous international studies, surveyed in the article, show that Greece is far more controlled by the shadow economy and the underground economy (= organized crime) than Italy. Our analysis with aggregate data from Eurostat provides further information about the full extent of the current socio-political disaster confronting Greece. On the one hand youth unemployment is a sad record in Europe: 22. 9 % of young people in the country were without work even before the onset of the current economic crisis, and this value will explode in 2009. The target group accuracy of the social system is one of the worst in Europe. In a regional perspective, Athens is an island of prosperity in a sea of poverty. In: East Macedonia, Thraki <b>Sterea</b> <b>Ellada</b> Voreio Aigaio Ipeiros Makedonia Dytiki youth unemployment was over 30 %. Also our other indicators • age-and gender-specific and regional employment rates • age-and gender-specific and regional employment rates • Proportion of adult population with only lower education • Research and development expenditure at the regional level • Regional Purchasing Power • Regional Productivity • Regional Lisbon indicator • Regional economic growth show that Greece, after receiving all these funds from the Brussels structural convergence programmes is having a very deficient regional development. We also show on the basis of our multivariate re-analysis of the data of 2007 UNICEF child poverty study that the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark had the best performance in Europe in eliminating child poverty. Our closer look at the 40 sub-components of the UNICEF study shows the deep crisis, which Greek youth is facing today. Particularly in the area of the acquisition of cognitive skills, Greece is very poorly placed. Our analysis thus shows that the crisis of the Greek social system unfortunately, has a deeper, even European dimension - the crisis of a heavily subsidized EU member country that has dismally failed. ...|$|E
