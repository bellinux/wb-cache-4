5|$|The overall {{gameplay}} received mixed reviews. <b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> {{believed that}} the gameplay was enjoyable, serviceable and acceptable by modern standards, but most others agreed {{that some of the}} gameplay mechanics, such as the cover system, lacked polish and were flawed. <b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> considered the gameplay generic due to its inclusion of typical shooter elements such as on-rail and turret segments, and stated that such mechanics are unable to help the game differentiate itself from other shooters such as Gears of War, and give the game an identity crisis. <b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> lamented that gameplay occasionally disconnects players from the story, creating tonal dissonance.
