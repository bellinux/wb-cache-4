The reaction was even greater in 1971, and amid the chaos of the public response, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders threatened to ban TVR from the show. This, of course, drew even more attention to the brand. The 1971 show also marked the appearance of the M <b>Series</b> <b>prototype</b> bodywork and the prototype SM estate car.|$|E

50|$|The Heckler & Koch MP2000 was {{an attempt}} to improve the MP5 <b>series.</b> <b>Prototypes</b> of the gun showed {{similarities}} to the UMP. An interesting feature of this gun was that it featured a silencing system which prevented the bullet from reaching supersonic speeds by venting some of the propellant gases.

V9 can be {{considered}} to be the [...] "real" [...] B <b>series</b> <b>prototype,</b> as V7 had received the DB 600Aa originally for experimental reasons. The entire surface was now flush riveted and the aircraft had several other aerodynamic cleanups. The radiator was again changed, this time to a semi-retractable design for reduced drag in flight. The aircraft also underwent a weight reduction program which reduced the empty weight to 1,617 kg (3,565 lb).|$|E

5000|$|From {{the late}} 1980s, Treasure Island's old {{aircraft}} Hangar 2 (Building 2) and Hangar 3 (Building 3) served as sound stages for film-making and TV, e.g., The Matrix ("bullet time" [...] visual effect), Rent, and The Pursuit of Happyness. Treasure Island was a film {{setting of the}} 1939 Charlie Chan at Treasure Island, 1988 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Berlin airport scene), 1995 Copycat (private compound), 1997 Flubber, 1998 What Dreams May Come, 1998 Patch Adams, 1998 The Parent Trap and 1999 Bicentennial Man. An establishing shot of the 1954 The Caine Mutiny shows the main gate and Administration Bldg 1 to indicate {{the location of the}} fictitious court martial. For three years Treasure Island served as the site of the Battlebots TV show. The offices and penthouse apartment sets in Nash Bridges were located on the island during the show's production (1996-2001). The island was featured as the base of operations for the prototypers in the 2008 Discovery Channel <b>series</b> <b>Prototype</b> This!. Building 180 (warehouse) and Building 111 (former firehouse) on Treasure Island served as film settings for an NBC series titled Trauma.|$|E

5000|$|On August 5, 1997, {{the store}} in Fort Gratiot Township, Michigan debuted a new {{prototype}} that evolved out of the mid-1990s prototype. This was the Presidential prototype, in which the logo {{was moved to the}} center of the building. Later Meijer stores of this design introduced the Meijer Fresh logo with the then-current Meijer logo and a large cursive [...] "Fresh" [...] on the right of the Meijer name. Most of these signs have since been phased out in favor of the current logo, with the lower case [...] "meijer" [...] (in red) with blue dots over the 'i' and 'j'. In the year 2000, the Presidential prototype was replaced with the Village Square prototype, which featured fake storefronts running across the front of the building and a barn-like section on which the Meijer logo was situated. That prototype, however, was soon replaced by the Signature <b>Series</b> <b>prototype,</b> which removed the fake storefronts, which itself was replaced in the mid-2000s with the current prototype, which features emphasis on the entrances, which feature towering glass walls with a tilted roof, resulting in an [...] "eyebrow" [...] appearance.|$|E
40|$|International audienceEstimating the {{centroid}} {{of a set}} of time series under time warp is a major topic for many temporal data mining applications, as summarization a set of time <b>series,</b> <b>prototype</b> extraction or clustering. The task is challenging as the estimation of centroid of time series faces the problem of multiple temporal alignments. This work compares the major progressive and iterative centroid estimation methods, under the dynamic time warping, which currently is the most relevant similarity measure in this context...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{new method}} for the {{extraction}} of features from stationary stochastic processes {{has been applied to}} a medical detection problem. It illustrates a practical application of automatic time series modeling. Firstly, the model type and the model order for two time <b>series</b> <b>prototype</b> models are selected. The prototypes represent the lung noises of a single healthy subject, before and after the application of methacholine. Using the model error ME as a measure for the difference between time series models, new data can be divided into classes that belong to the prototype models for this person. The prototype models are obtained from a few expiration cycles under known conditions. This is sufficient to detect the presence of methacholine in new data of the same subject if he is able to maintain stationary conditions by following accurately the prescribed breathing pattern. It is not necessary to use the same model type and the same model order for the prototypes and for new data. Automatically and individually selected models for prototypes and data give a good detection of methacholine.

50|$|Although the 288 {{never even}} reached {{production}} status, let alone official operational service, the aircraft did see limited combat duty. In 1944, following {{the cancellation of}} the 288 programme, the surviving A and C <b>series</b> <b>prototypes</b> were hurriedly fitted with defensive armament and equipment and deployed as reconnaissance bombers on the Western Front. Very few missions were flown, owing to the scarcity of aviation fuel and spare parts, and the unresolved problems with the aircraft's powerplant and undercarriage.

In 1967, a short-lived V8-powered version of the A110, named as A111, was introduced. A major redesign of the A111, the A220, was unveiled the following year. The bad results of this last two cars made Alpine to withdraw of sports car racing for various years.|$|R
