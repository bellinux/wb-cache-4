St Paul Covent Garden was completely surrounded by the parish of <b>St</b> <b>Martin</b> in the Fields.

5|$|Ralph {{was the son}} of Seffrid d'Escures and {{his first}} wife Rascendis, and a half brother of Seffrid I, Bishop of Chichester from 1125 to 1145. The surname of de Turbine, by which he is {{sometimes}} known in older scholarship, is only attested in the fourteenth century and possibly resulted from confusion with William de Corbeil, Ralph's successor at Canterbury. Ralph studied at the school at the Abbey of Bec before entering the abbey of <b>St</b> <b>Martin</b> at Séez in 1079. <b>St.</b> <b>Martin</b> was a house founded by the Montgomery and Bellême families, and was still under their lordship.

The Strand was the northern boundary of the precinct of the Savoy, which was approximately where the approach to Waterloo Bridge is now. All of these parishes and places {{became part of the}} Strand District in 1855, except <b>St</b> <b>Martin</b> in the Fields which was governed separately.

5|$|Sale is {{a diverse}} {{community}} with a synagogue and Christian churches of various denominations. The church buildings were mostly constructed in the late 19th or early 20th century {{in the wake of}} the population boom created by the arrival of the railway in 1849, although records show that the Church of <b>St</b> <b>Martin</b> in Ashton upon Mersey dates back to at least 1304. Before the English Reformation, the inhabitants of Sale were predominantly Catholic, but afterwards were members of the Church of England. Roman Catholics returned to the area in the 19th century in the form of Irish immigrants. Two of the three Grade II* listed buildings in the town are churches. The Church of <b>St</b> <b>Martin,</b> which was probably originally an early 14th-century timber framed structure, was rebuilt in 1714 after the church had been destroyed in a storm. The Church of St John the Divine was built in 1868, to the design of Alfred Waterhouse. There are three Grade II listed churches in Sale: the Church of St Anne; the Church of St Mary Magdalene; and the Church of St Paul.|$|E
