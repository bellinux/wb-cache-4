5|$|The story {{continues}} {{with the arrival}} of several more Christian princes and their armies. Radiaro and Calafia issue a challenge to two Christian warriors to engage them in single combat for the purpose of deciding the battle. King Amadis and his son Esplandián accept the challenge. The black-skinned warrior woman chosen as messenger tells Calafia that Esplandián is the most handsome and elegant man that has ever existed. Calafia determines that she must <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> herself before engaging him in combat. She stays awake all night wondering whether to wear royal robes or warrior's armor. Deciding in favor of a thick golden toga embroidered with jewels, topped by a golden hood, she rode to meet her enemies, escorted by 2,000 women warriors. After being seated among the Christian kings, she immediately recognized Esplandián from his great beauty, {{and fell in love with}} him. She tells him she will meet him on the field of battle and, if they should live, that she wishes to speak further with him. Esplandián considers Calafia an infidel, an abomination of the rightfully subservient position of woman in relation to man, and he makes no response.|$|E

King Hubert fails to convince him otherwise, leaving Hubert in equal disappointment.|$|E
500|$|In March 1810, {{he married}} the 19-year old Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, {{and a great}} niece of Marie Antoinette by proxy; thus he had married into a German royal and {{imperial}} family. [...] Louise was less than happy with the arrangement, at least at first, stating [...] "Just to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{would be the worst}} form of torture". [...] Her great-aunt had been executed in France, while Napoleon had fought numerous campaigns against Austria all throughout his military career. [...] However, she seemed to warm up to him over time. [...] After her wedding, she wrote to her father [...] "He loves me very much. I respond to his love sincerely. There is something very fetching and very eager about him that is impossible to resist".|$|E
500|$|On {{their way}} back to Salzburg Leopold and Wolfgang stayed for a while at Venice, pausing on their way at Brescia to see an opera buffa. While in Venice, Leopold used his letters of {{introduction}} to meet the nobility and to negotiate a contract for Wolfgang to write an opera for the San Benedetto theatre. Wolfgang gave several concerts and perhaps played at Venice's famed ospidali—former orphanages [...] which became respected music academies. The Mozarts were received generously, but Leopold appeared dissatisfied. [...] "The father seems a shade piqued", wrote a correspondent to the Viennese composer Johann Adolph Hasse, adding: [...] "...they probably expected others to seek after them, rather than they after others". Hasse replied: [...] "The father, as I <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> is equally discontent everywhere".|$|E

500|$|Nominees were {{originally}} limited to just books at the Frankfurt Book Fair, {{but this was}} extended to submissions sent in by The Bookseller magazine's traditional readership of librarians, publishers, and booksellers in order to decrease the risk of no award being given. In 2009, submissions could be sent to either Bent's or The Bookseller's Twitter accounts. People cannot nominate their own works, nor can they select books they publish themselves. Titles that are deliberately created to be funny are normally rejected. Also, nominators, judges and voters are actively discouraged from reading any of the nominations, [...] "for fear that becoming {{too close to the}} work may cloud their judgement in declaring the text's title 'odd'. Especially considering the prize champions 'odd titles' and not 'odd books' (<b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> Booker for the latter)". The winner was originally voted for by a panel of judges, but since 2000 the winner has been voted for by members of the public via the Internet. Bent resisted this move and threatened to resign, but he later reconsidered and now creates the short list of finalists.|$|E
500|$|One year later, Sally and Larry {{have opened}} a {{combined}} book and DVD store. Sally insists on keeping a folder of the events, including Larry's completed transcript, but Larry {{wants her to}} move on and indicates he has feelings for her. Sally gently rebuffs him and Larry steps out on an errand. Sally sees the Doctor and Martha hurriedly leave a taxi in front of the shop and goes outside to meet them. They don't recognise her and she realises that they have yet to experience the events that sent them to the past. She hands the Doctor the folder, warning him that he will need it in his future. The Doctor and Sally say goodbye as Larry returns, surprised to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> from the Easter egg. Sally and Larry return to the shop hand in hand, hinting that she is now ready for a romantic relationship. The episode ends with a repeat of the Doctor's [...] "don't blink" [...] warning to Sally, this time directed at the viewer and overlaid with flashes of famous statues.|$|E
500|$|As was Davis's penchant, {{he called}} for almost no {{rehearsal}} and the musicians had little idea what they were to record. As described in the original liner notes by pianist Bill Evans, Davis had only given the band sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise. Once the musicians were assembled, Davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set to taping the sextet in studio. While the results were impressive with so little preparation, the persistent legend that the entire album was recorded in one pass is untrue. Only [...] "Flamenco Sketches" [...] yielded a complete take on the first try. That take, not the master, was issued in 1997 as a bonus alternate take. The five master takes issued, however, were the only other complete takes; an insert for the ending to [...] "Freddie Freeloader" [...] was recorded, but was not used for release or {{on the issues of}} Kind of Blue prior to the 1997 reissue. Pianist Wynton Kelly may not have been happy to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> he replaced, Bill Evans, back in his old seat. Perhaps to assuage the pianist's feelings, Davis had Kelly play instead of Evans on the album's most blues-oriented number, [...] "Freddie Freeloader". The live album Miles Davis at Newport 1958 documents this band. However, the Newport Jazz Festival recording on July 3, 1958, reflects the band in its hard bop conception, the presence of Bill Evans only six weeks into his brief tenure in the Davis band notwithstanding, rather than the modal approach of Kind of Blue.|$|E

[...] Audubon had great respect for Native Americans: [...] "Whenever I meet Indians, I feel the greatness of our Creator in all its splendor, for there I <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> naked from His hand and yet free from acquired sorrow." [...] Audubon also admired the skill of Kentucky riflemen and the [...] "regulators", citizen lawmen who created a kind of justice on the Kentucky frontier.

2500|$|In early April 2005, Phoenix {{checked into}} rehab {{to be treated}} for alcoholism. On January 26, 2006, while driving down a winding canyon road in Hollywood, Phoenix ran {{off the road and}} rolled his car. The crash was {{reportedly}} caused by brake failure. Shaken and confused, Phoenix heard a tapping on his window and a voice say, [...] "Just relax." [...] Unable to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> Phoenix replied, [...] "I'm fine. I am relaxed." [...] The man replied, [...] "No, you're not," [...] and stopped Phoenix from lighting a cigarette while gasoline was leaking into the car cabin. Phoenix then realized that the man was famed German film director Werner Herzog. While Herzog helped Phoenix out of the wreckage by breaking the back window of the car, bystanders phoned for an ambulance. Phoenix approached Herzog to express gratitude, but Herzog downplayed his heroism and returned to his home nearby.|$|E

[...] They reunite, but learn that neither planted the message for the other, as they had both assumed. They discover that the room is filled with humanoid robots that prevent them leaving. They are then descended into a lair where they <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> from the river surrounded by other idle humanoid robots. [...] Observing mismatched body parts, the Doctor surmises the man is a long-lived cyborg, but in an unusual sense. [...] It is a robot trying to make itself human by replacing its mechanical parts with biological ones taken from spontaneous combustion victims, including the dinosaur. [...] The robot's own 'face' is only half-covered with skin, exposing part of its skull's mechanisms.|$|E
2500|$|Anna (Elizabeth Lail) {{arrives at}} Rumplestiltskin's (Robert Carlyle) tower {{and talks to}} him about the {{disappearance}} of her parents. Rumplestiltskin offers to help if she puts the contents of a vial into the Apprentice's drink telling her that he is an evil man. Anna states that she will do [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to find out why her parents visited The Enchanted Forest and Rumplestiltskin comments that he loves when people say they will do whatever it takes. Anna goes to the man's house and after a brief conversation she has a chance to put the vial's contents into his tea but instead decides to throw them into the fire thinking that it is poison. Anna arrives back at Rumplestiltskin's tower and informs him that she gave the contents of the vial to the Apprentice. Mr. Gold says that is good because it is an antidote to a poison he was given yesterday. Anna, horrified by this, tells Rumplestiltskin the truth and says they must go back to the cottage.

2500|$|Labourer George Hutchinson, {{who knew}} Kelly, {{reported}} that she met him at about 2:00a.m. and asked him for a loan of sixpence. He claimed to be broke and that as Kelly went on her way she was approached by a man of [...] "Jewish appearance". Hutchinson later gave the police an extremely {{detailed description of the}} man right down to the colour of his eyelashes despite it being the middle of a dark winter night. He reported that he overheard them talking in the street opposite the court where Kelly was living; Kelly complained of losing her handkerchief, and the man gave her a red one of his own. Hutchinson claimed that Kelly and the man headed for her room, that he followed them, and that he saw neither one of them again, laying off his watch at about 2:45. Hutchinson's statement appears to be partly corroborated by laundress Sarah Lewis, who reported seeing a man watching the entrance to Miller's Court as she passed into it at about 2:30 to spend the night with some friends, the Keylers. Hutchinson claimed that he was suspicious of the man because although Kelly seemed to know him, his opulent appearance made him seem very unusual in that neighbourhood, but only reported this to the police after the inquest on Kelly had been hastily concluded. Abberline, the detective in charge of the investigation, thought Hutchinson's information was important and sent him out with officers {{to see if he could}} <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> again. Hutchinson's name does not appear again in the existing police records, and so it is not possible to say with certainty whether his evidence was ultimately dismissed, disproven, or corroborated. In his memoirs Walter Dew discounts Hutchinson on the basis that his sighting may have been on a different day, and not the morning of the murder. Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who got a good look at the killer was Jewish. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness. Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself, trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he may have just been an attention seeker who made up a story he hoped to sell to the press.|$|E
