In this work, the strain field in InGaN/GaN multi-quantum wells (MQWs) micro-pillars is investigated using micro-Raman spectroscopy {{and the design}} of micro-pillars were studied experimentally. We distinguished the strained and strain-relieved signatures of the GaN layer from the E 2 phonon peak split from the Raman scattering signatures at 572 cm- 1 and 568 cm- 1, respectively. The extent of <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> is examined considering the height and size of micro-pillars fabricated using focused ion beam (FIB) micro-machining technique. A significant <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> can be achieved when one micro-machined through the entire epi-layers, 3 μm in our study. The dependence of <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> on micro-pillar diameter (D) suggested that micro-pillar with D < 3 μm showed high degree of <b>strain</b> <b>relief.</b> Our results shed new insights into designing strain-relieved InGaN/GaN microstructures for high brightness light emitting diode arrays. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|<b>Strain</b> <b>relief</b> in lattice {{mismatched}} heteroepitaxy {{is mediated}} by formation and/or propagation of dislocations. Due to their technological significance, {{the process of}} <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> in materials with face-centred cubic (fcc) lattices has been analyzed by several researchers 1, 2 following the work by Matthews and co-workers in the late 1960 s to early 1970 s 3 - 6. In the Matthews model, {{it is assumed that}} the strain relieved by any misfit dislocation is equal to the edge component of the dislocation burgers vector in the interface plane. This assumption has been used in all subsequent analyses of <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> in lattice mismatched heteroepitaxy [1, 2]. Based upon the known three-dimensional atomic structure of the dislocations in fcc lattices, we show that the assumption is not valid for the 60 degree dislocations that form/expand via the conservative glide process. For compressively (tensilely) strained films the assumption is valid only for the 90 degree dislocations that form/expand via aggregation of vacancies (interstitials).

40|$|The <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> of heteroepitaxial bcc-Fe(001) films, {{deposited}} at 520 - 570 K onto MgO(001), {{has been}} investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy. In accordance with real-time stress measurements, the tensile misfit strain is relieved during coalescence of flat, mainly 2 - 3 monolayers (ML) high Fe islands at the high thickness of similar to 20 ML. To accommodate the misfit between merging strain-relaxed islands, a network of 1 / 2 [111] screw dislocations is formed. A strong barrier for dislocation glide-which is typical for bcc metals-is most likely responsible for the big delay in <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> of Fe/MgO(001), since only the elastic energy of the uppermost layer(s) is available {{for the formation of}} an energy-costly intermediate layer...|$|R

Design: Observational case series. Participants: Nine patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and 3 normal controls. Methods: The ONHs of 9 subjects with POAG (pre-TE IOP: 25. 3 +/- 13. 9 mmHg; post-TE IOP: 11. 8 +/- 8. 6 mmHg) were imaged (1 eye per subject) using optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Heidelberg Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) before (0. 05), suggesting biomechanical variability across subjects.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we {{consider}} two representative methods for residual stress evaluation at the micro-scale: a (semi-) destructive method involving material removal and the measurement of strain relief; and a non-destructive X-ray diffraction technique involving the use of micro-focused synchrotron X-ray beam. A recently developed <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> approach is described using a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) to create a circular trench of progressively increasing depth around a circular "island". Residual stress is evaluated by the comparison of the <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> (measured by digital correlation of displacements or strains) with Finite Element simulations.

40|$|Introduction: Stimulation of the {{occipital}} nerves {{is becoming}} more widely accepted {{in the treatment of}} occipital neuritis and migraine disorders. Objective: Presently, equipment available for spinal cord stimulation is adapted for insertion into the subcutaneous space over the occipital nerves. Many technical factors need to be reassessed to optimize the therapy. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients implanted from 2003 to 2007 at a single center. We aimed to analyze the rate of surgical complications related to implantation technique. A total of 28 patients were present for analysis. Patients were followed up to 60 months with a mean follow-up of 21 months. Results: There is a 32 % revision rate for electrode migration or displacement, 3. 6 % removal rate for infection, and a 21 % removal rate for lack of efficacy. Although not well studied secondary to small patient populations, this was consistent with {{a review of the literature}} which demonstrated a 10 - 60 % revision rate. Other factors such as anchoring strategy, <b>strain</b> <b>relief,</b> and battery location were all considered in the analysis and will be presented. A major determination was that use of a second incision with an additional <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> loop had only a 10 % revision rate of the lead while those without this additional <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> loop had a 62. 5 % revision rate.
