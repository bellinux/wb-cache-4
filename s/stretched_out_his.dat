5|$|Mechanical cup-bearers and wine-pourers on automatic-traveling boats: The {{mechanical}} engineer Huang Gun served {{the court of}} Emperor Yang Di (r. 604–617) and wrote the book Shuishi Tujing on his inventions, which his colleague Du Bao enlarged and commented on. He constructed seven small boats, called 'wine boats', that were as large as 3m (10ft) long and 1.8m (6ft) wide which supported a number of mechanical figures of wooden statues called 'hydraulic elegances', each about 0.6m (2ft) tall, some of them animals but most in human form consisting of singing girls, musicians playing actual instruments, dancers and tumblers, oarsmen busy rowing, cup-bearers, and wine-pourers all moving simultaneously as if alive. These boats were set to travel at timed intervals along circuits made of winding stone channels and canals in palace courtyards and gardens (designed by Tang Haogui), where guests would gather for special occasions. The cup-bearer stood at the bow of each ship and beside him the wine-pourer; when the ship made automatically timed periodic stops where guests were seated, the cup-bearer automatically <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> arm with a full cup of wine. When the guest was done emptying his cup, he placed the cup back into the figure's hands; the latter then waited as the wine-pourer filled a second cup to be emptied. When this guest had been served, the wine boat automatically moved onwards to the next stop. The British sinologist, scientist, and historian Joseph Needham speculates that the 'wine boats' may have been paddle-wheel-driven. Another paddle wheel ship was commanded by Wang Zhen'e and described in his biographies dated from the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479). side from the partial remains of the Shuishi Tujing, an account of these 'wine boats' was also preserved by Huang Gun's contemporary Yan Shigu (581–645).|$|E
25|$|Daoxin {{eventually}} {{settled at}} East Mountain Temple on Shuangfeng ("Twin Peaks") where he taught Chan Buddhism {{for thirty years}} and attracted large numbers of practitioners, some records say five hundred laypeople and monks. In 643 the emperor Tai Zong invited Daoxin to the capital city but Daoxin refused to appear. Three times the emperor sent emissaries and three times Daoxin refused the invitation. The third time the emperor instructed to either bring back Daoxin or his head. When the emissary related this instruction to Daoxin, Daoxin exposed and <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> neck to allow the emissary to chop off his head. The envoy was so shocked he reported this event to the emperor, who then honored Daoxin as an exemplary Buddhist monk.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Book of Exodus, Aaron first {{functioned as}} Moses' assistant. Because Moses {{complained that he}} could not speak well, God {{appointed}} Aaron as Moses' [...] "prophet" [...] (Exodus 4:10-17; 7:1). At the command of Moses, he let his rod turn into a snake. Then he <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> rod in order to bring on the first three plagues. After that, Moses tended to act and speak for himself.|$|E

2500|$|Guan Yu {{was once}} {{injured in the}} left arm by a stray arrow, which pierced through his arm. Although the wound had healed, he would {{experience}} pain in the bone whenever there was a heavy downpour. A physician told him, [...] "The arrowhead had poison on it and the poison had seeped into the bone. The {{way to get rid}} of this problem is to cut open your arm and scrape away the poison in your bone." [...] Guan Yu then <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> arm and asked the physician to heal him. He then invited his subordinates to dine with him while the surgery was being performed. Blood flowed from his arm into a container below. Throughout the operation, Guan Yu feasted and drank wine and chatted with his men as though nothing had happened.|$|E
2500|$|Pius XI {{was also}} a very {{demanding}} individual, {{certainly one of the}} stricter pontiffs at that time. He held very high standards and did not tolerate any sort of behaviour that was not up to that standard. In regard to Angelo Roncalli, the future Pope John XXIII, a diplomatic blunder in Bulgaria, where Roncalli was stationed, led Pius XI to make Roncalli kneel for 45 minutes as a punishment. However, it should also be indicated that when in due course Pius learnt that Roncalli had made the error in circumstances for which he could not fairly be considered culpable, he apologized to him. Aware of the implied impropriety of a Supreme Pontiff's going back on a reprimand in a matter concerning Catholic faith and morals, but also deeply conscious that on a human level he had failed to keep his temper in check, he made his apology [...] "as Achille Ratti" [...] and in doing so <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand in friendship to Monsignor Roncalli.|$|E
2500|$|The pseudepigraphic Epistle of Barnabas, which {{scholars}} suggest {{may have}} been {{before the end of}} the 1st century, and certainly earlier than 135, whether the writer was an orthodox Christian or not, described the shape people at the time attributed to the device on which Jesus died: the comparisons it draws with Old Testament figures would have had no validity for its readers if they pictured Jesus as dying on a simple stake. Referring to what he saw as Old Testament intimations of Jesus and his cross, he likened the cross to the letter T (the Greek letter tau, which had the numeric value of 300), thus describing it as having a crossbeam. He also wrote, with regard to : [...] "The Spirit saith to the heart of Moses, that he should make a type of the cross and of Him that was to suffer, that unless, saith He, they shall set their hope on Him, war shall be waged against them for ever. Moses therefore pileth arms one upon another in the midst of the encounter, and standing on higher ground than any he <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hands, and so Israel was again victorious." ...|$|E

2500|$|Each of {{the regulars}} brought their {{individual}} style to playing the game. Clement Freud liked to make lists and to challenge {{with only a}} few seconds to go. He was among the show's more competitive players, regularly referring to the rules and deprecating any deviation from them. Derek Nimmo often improvised descriptions of his experiences abroad, many derived from his extensive theatrical tours. He too was highly competitive, and was known for berating the chairman frequently. Peter Jones once said that in all his years playing the game, he never quite got the hang of it; nonetheless, his self-deprecating, laconic style suited the essential silliness of the show. Kenneth Williams was often the star of the show: his flamboyant tantrums, arch put-downs, and mock sycophancy made him the audience's favourite. Williams often <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> speeches by extending every syllable to breaking point (some words lasting for up to three seconds), and his outbursts of mock-anger regularly included his catchphrase [...] "I've come all the way from Great Portland Street", as though he had journeyed for miles, when in fact his home was just {{around the corner from the}} BBC studios where most recordings took place. Merton frequently launches into surreal flights of fancy and fantasy, such as claiming to have had unusual occupations or to have experienced significant historical events. He also often wins points by challenging just before the whistle or for humorous challenges, another technique being to say the same word in the singular and the plural, for inexperienced panelists to falsely challenge.|$|E
