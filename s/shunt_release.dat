40|$|The high {{metabolic}} rate required for tumor growth {{often leads to}} hypoxia in poorly-perfused regions. Hypoxia activates a complex gene expression program, mediated by hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF 1 alpha). One {{of the consequences of}} HIF 1 alpha activation is up-regulation of glycolysis and hence the production of lactic acid. In addition to the lactic acid-output, intracellular titration of acid with bicarbonate and the engagement of the pentose phosphate <b>shunt</b> <b>release</b> CO(2) from cells. Expression of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase 9 on the tumor cell surface catalyses the extracellular trapping of acid by hydrating cell-generated CO(2) into [see text] and H(+). These mechanisms contribute towards an acidic extracellular milieu favoring tumor growth, invasion and development. The lactic acid released by tumor cells is further metabolized by the tumor stroma. Low extracellular pH may adversely affect the intracellular milieu, possibly triggering apoptosis. Therefore, primary and secondary active transporters operate in the tumor cell membrane to protect the cytosol from acidosis. We review mechanisms regulating tumor intracellular and extracellular pH, with a focus on carbonic anhydrase 9. We also review recent evidence that may suggest a role for CA 9 in coordinating pH(i) among cells of large, unvascularized cell-clusters...|$|E

40|$|Power {{factor is}} a way of {{measuring}} the percentage of reactive power in an electrical system. Reactive power represents wasted energy [...] electricity that does no useful work because the electrical current is out of phase with the voltage. Reactive power is used by inductive loads (such as, motors, transformers, fluorescent lights, arc welders and induction furnaces) to sustain their magnetic fields. Electric systems with many motors exhibit low power factors, increased conductor and transformer losses, and lower voltages. Utilities must supply both active and reactive power and compensate for these losses. Power factor can be improved by the addition of shunt capacitors. Capacitors act in opposition to inductive loads, thereby minimizing the reactive power required to serve them. In raising the power factor, <b>shunt</b> capacitors <b>release</b> energy to the system, reduce system losses, and ultimately decrease power costs. Improving system power factor can reduce reactive and active power losses for both industry and utilities through the addition of shunt capacitors. This Guide Book gives electric utility technical staff, industrial end-users, consultants and BPA employees a step-by-step method for evaluating the cost effectiveness of installing power factor correction capacitors in an industrial plant...|$|R
40|$|Down-regulation ("curb") of hexose {{transport}} in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts {{has been}} studied in a metabolic mutant highly defective in phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI; glucosephosphate isomerase; D-glucose- 6 -phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5. 3. 1. 9). In the parental strain (PGI+) glucose as well as glucosamine and mannose were able to elicit a curb of the hexose transport system. In the PGI mutant, only glucose was able to mediate a transport curb. The inability of glucosamine and mannose to promote a transport curb in the PGI strain must be ascribed {{to the fact that}} the 6 -esters of these aldohexoses are converted by their own specific deaminase and isomerase to fructose 6 -phosphate, which initiates the pyruvate-tricarboxylate energy-yielding pathway but cannot be converted to glucose 6 -phosphate in the mutant. The latter ester can be metabolized, but its metabolism in the mutant is confined to the pentose shunt. It is shown that inhibitors such as 2, 4 -dinitrophenol and malonate exert only slight inhibition of the pentose <b>shunt</b> yet <b>release</b> the glucose-mediated curb elicited by glucose and glucosamine in the parental PGI+ strain and also the glucose transport curb persisting in the PGI mutant...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of a neuron to its input can be modulated in several ways. Changes in {{the slope of}} the neuronal input-output curve depend on factors such as shunting inhibition, background noise, frequency-dependent synaptic excitation, and balanced excitation and inhibition. However, in early development GABAergic interneurons are excitatory and other mechanisms such as asynchronous transmitter release might contribute to regulating neuronal sensitivity. We modeled both phasic and asynchronous synaptic transmission in early development to study the impact of activity-dependent noise and short-term plasticity on the synaptic gain. Asynchronous release decreased or increased the gain depending on the membrane conductance. In the high shunt regime, excitatory input due to asynchronous release was divisive, whereas in the low shunt regime it had a nearly multiplicative effect on the firing rate. In addition, sensitivity to correlated inputs was influenced by <b>shunting</b> and asynchronous <b>release</b> in opposite ways. Thus, asynchronous release can regulate th...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionToday, {{pancreatic}} surgery can {{be performed}} with low mortality and tolerable morbidity in specialized centers. Nevertheless, due to its anatomical localization and proximity to important vascular structures, surgical resection of the pancreas remains challenging in many cases. Presentation of caseHere, we present {{the case of a}} young woman who presented in our department with abdominal pain and a tumor mass located at the pancreatic head. She had undergone explorative laparotomy elsewhere before, in which the pancreatic tumor mass was reported to be unresectable due to infiltration of the mesenteric root. However, biopsies obtained had not revealed malignancy. Moreover, postoperatively a stenting of the portal vein had been performed due to portal vein thrombosis and varices. Upon admission in our clinic, computed tomography revealed a tumor of the pancreatic head, occlusion of the portal vein stent and, more importantly, extravascular dislocation of the stent with perforation into the stomach. Upon explorative laparotomy we initially performed a mesenterico-caval <b>shunt</b> to <b>release</b> portal hypertension. Secondly, the dislocated stent was successfully removed upon gastrotomy, and finally, a partial pancreaticoduodencectomy was performed. Interestingly, the histopathological analysis revealed granulocytic epithelial lesions (GELs) confirming a type- 2 autoimmune pancreatitis without evidence for malignancy. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patients was dismissed without any remaining symptoms. Discussion & conclusionThis interesting and unique case underlines the complexity in diagnosis of pancreatic tumors with unsolved dignity and differential diagnosis of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, it demonstrated the challenges in pancreatic surgery for exceptional and uncommon conditions demanding complex surgical approaches...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivePatch closure after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) {{improves}} clinical outcome {{compared with}} primary closure. Whether {{there are differences}} in outcome between various patch materials is still not clear. The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate whether a relationship exists between the patch type and the number of microemboli as registered during CEA by transcranial Doppler imaging, the clinical outcome (transient ischemic attack and cerebrovascular accident), and the occurrence of restenosis. MethodsWe included 319 patients who underwent CEA. Intraoperative microembolus registration was performed in 205 procedures. Microembolization was recorded during four different periods: dissection, <b>shunting,</b> clamp <b>release,</b> and wound closure. The decision to perform primary closure or to use a patch for the closure of the arteriotomy was made by the surgeon, and Dacron patches were used when venous material was insufficient. Cerebral events were recorded within the first month after CEA, and duplex scanning was performed at 3 months (n = 319) and 1 year (n = 166) after CEA. A diameter reduction of more than 70 % was defined as restenosis. ResultsPrimary, venous, and Dacron patch closures were performed in 83 (26. 0 %), 171 (53. 6 %), and 65 (20. 4 %) patients, respectively. Primary closure was significantly related to sex (Dacron patch, 35 men and 30 women; venous patch, 108 men and 63 women; primary closure, 72 men and 11 women; P <. 001). The occurrence of microemboli during wound closure was also related to sex (women, 2. 5 ± 0. 6; men, 1. 0 ± 0. 2; P =. 01). Additionally, during clamp release, Dacron patches were associated with significantly more microemboli than venous patches (11. 1 ± 3. 4 vs 4. 0 ± 0. 9; P <. 01), and this difference was also noted during wound closure (3. 1 ± 0. 9 vs 1. 4 ± 0. 4; P <. 05). Transient ischemic attacks and minor strokes after CEA occurred in 5 (2. 4 %) of 205 and 6 (2. 9 %) of 205 procedures, respectively, and the degree of microembolization during dissection was related to adverse cerebral events (P =. 003). In contrast, the type of closure was not related to immediate clinical adverse events. However, primary closure and Dacron patches were associated with an increase in the restenosis rate compared with venous patches: after 400 days, the restenosis rate for Primary closure was 11 %, Dacron patch 16 %, and venous patch 7 % (P =. 05; Kaplan-Meier estimates). ConclusionsMicroemboli are more prevalent during clamp releases and wound closure when Dacron patches are used. Additionally, the observed differences in embolization noted by patch type were mainly evident in women. However, the use of Dacron patches was not related to immediate ischemic cerebral events but was associated with a higher restenosis rate compared with venous patch closure. This suggests that venous patch closure may be preferred for CEA...|$|R
