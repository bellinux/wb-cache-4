Demoralized by his flight and by the betrayal by Yodo and Tsu, Shogunate forces retreated, making the Toba-Fushimi encounter an Imperial victory, although it is often considered the Shogunate forces <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the encounter. Osaka Castle was soon invested on February 8 (on March 1, Western calendar), {{putting an end to}} the battle of Toba-Fushimi.|$|E
5|$|At the 1963 World Championships in Stockholm, the Soviet Union won {{the gold}} medal, {{beginning}} a streak of nine consecutive World Championship golds. The 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria {{marked the first time}} that Canada failed to win an Olympic medal in hockey. The Soviet Union won all seven of their games and the gold medal, but Canada finished the tournament with five wins and two losses, putting them in a three-way tie for second place with Sweden and Czechoslovakia. Prior to 1964, the tie-breaking procedure was based on goal difference from games against teams in the medal round and under that system, Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechoslovaks. The procedure had been changed to count all games and that meant the Canadians finished fourth. However, the Olympics also counted as the World Championships, and under IIHF rules, Canada <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> a bronze. In April 2005, the IIHF admitted that a mistake had occurred and announced that they had reviewed the decision and would award the 1964 Canadian team a World Championship bronze medal. However, two months later, the IIHF over-turned their decision and rejected an appeal in September.|$|E
5|$|Norman Biggs {{was born}} in Cardiff to John and Emily Biggs. His father, who lived at Park Place in {{the centre of the}} city, was a brewer by trade who owned {{businesses}} in Cardiff and Bristol. Biggs was privately educated at several proprietary schools including Lewinsdale School in Weston-super-Mare, before matriculating to University College Cardiff and later Trinity Hall, Cambridge, playing rugby for both university teams. It was reported that Biggs <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> a sporting 'Blue' while at Cambridge, but an injury to his ribs ruled him out. As well as playing rugby, Biggs was a keen sprinter {{and he was able to}} run 100 yards in even time, and was able to beat world sprint champion Charlton Monypenny at this distance. On returning to Cardiff he joined his father's brewing business. In 1887, Biggs played his first senior game for Cardiff RFC, in a match against Penarth. Biggs came from a large sporting family and was one of six brothers to play rugby for Cardiff. His most notable brothers were Selwyn, who also played for Wales, and Cecil, who captained Cardiff during their 1904/05 season.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{completing}} the final stage, Roche told {{the media that}} by winning the final time trial he felt he silenced any critics who doubted whether he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the race. In addition, Roche announced his intention {{to compete in the}} Tour de France in July. He won the Tour with a margin of forty seconds over the second-place finisher and thus became the fifth rider to win the Giro and Tour in the same year. In September, Roche won the men's road race at the 1987 UCI Road World Championships and became the second rider to achieve the Triple Crown of Cycling, which consists of winning two Grand Tour races and the men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships in a calendar year. For his career successes in the Giro d'Italia, Roche was inducted into the race's Hall of Fame in 2014. After dropping out of the 1987 edition of the Giro, Visentini did not win any further stages or classifications in major races, and retired from cycling in 1990, at the age of 33.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 he and O.G.S. Crawford {{resigned}} as Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries in protest at {{the election of}} James Mann to the Presidency following the retirement of Cyril Fox. They believed that Mann, Keeper of the Tower's Armouries at the Tower of London, was a poor choice and that Wheeler, an actual prehistorian, <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the election. In 1952 a group of British Marxist historians began publishing the periodical Past & Present, with Childe joining the editorial board. He also became a board member for The Modern Quarterly (later The Marxist Quarterly) during the early 1950s, working alongside old friend, the Communist leader, Rajani Palme Dutt, chairman of the board. He authored occasional articles for Palme Dutt's socialist journal, the Labour Monthly, but disagreed with him over the Hungarian Revolution of 1956; Palme Dutt defended the Soviet Union's decision to quash the revolution using military force, but like many western socialists, Childe strongly disagreed. The event made Childe abandon faith in the Soviet leadership, but not in socialism and Marxism. Childe retained a love of the Soviet Union, having visiting on multiple occasions and having been involved with CPBG satellite body the Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR, and serving as President of their National History and Archaeology Section from the early 1950s until his death.|$|E
5|$|England {{maintained}} their newly confident approach, being on top {{for most of}} the fourth Test. Yardley's men scored 496 and achieved a first innings lead of 38, Yardley contributing two wickets. England increased their lead by 365 before Yardley declared. He kept the team batting for five minutes on the last day, allowing him to use the heavy roller to quicken the break-up of the pitch. Australia had to score 404 in 345 minutes, a target considered unlikely as such a large total had never been made to win a Test match. In addition, the pitch was difficult to bat on by now and the spinners could turn the ball sharply. However, England made several errors: Godfrey Evans, the England wicket-keeper had a bad day and missed some stumping chances; three catches were dropped by fielders, and England's only specialist spinner, Jim Laker, bowled poorly. Consequently, Yardley was forced to use Denis Compton's bowling. Compton was not a specialist bowler and although he caused problems for the batsmen, Bill Bowes believed the selectors were mistaken in expecting him to be as effective as a front line spinner. Yardley seemed unsure of the best course of action as Bradman and Arthur Morris added 301 runs for the second wicket; he resorted to using the very occasional leg spin of Hutton, who was hit for 30 runs in four overs, although Yardley himself dropped a catch from Hutton's bowling. The pitch conditions were unfavourable for the faster bowlers, but the ineffectiveness of the spinners forced Yardley to take the new ball. Australia won by seven wickets; the spectators were unhappy with the inadequate English bowling and the absence of a suitable bowler to exploit the pitch on the last day. Bowes later criticised Yardley for allowing Australia to score quickly enough to win; he believed that Yardley used Hutton's bowling to encourage the tourists to take risks against lesser bowling to keep up with required rate of scoring, but he miscalculated in using such bowling for too long. Wisden also stated that England <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the match.|$|E

This will help us show that the first player <b>has</b> a <b>winning</b> strategy if he can bound the size of the complete graph on which the game is played or he can color a few edges more then the opponent. At the end we will discuss game, when a complete graph of a given size is a minor of target subgraph.

In fact, the loss of the first test in Multan is considered by many analysts of the game to be a turning point for the fortunes of the England side, one from which they still have not fully come back from to this date. It was a match they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>won,</b> and they assumed they would win. However, Pakistan took advantage of their complacency and basically dominated the series from that point onwards.|$|E
25|$|With Jochen Rindt signing for Lotus for 1969, Oliver was out, {{switching}} to BRM. He was to suffer disappointing {{two years at}} the Bourne team, which would effectively kill off his Grand Prix career. In two years, he would muster just four finishes, with his only points scores being 6th place in the 1969 Mexican Grand Prix, and 5th in the 1970 Austrian Grand Prix. However, in 1970 he led much of the Race of Champions holding off Stewart and was a strong third {{for most of the}} Dutch and British GP. The poor result in the Austrian GP which Team boss, Lou Stanley thought he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>won,</b> saw the best car go to Rodriquez from then on, but Oliver still led some laps at the slipstream Italian race. Stanley described Oliver, as 'good, but not nearly as good as he thought'. The majority of his other races saw the BRM break down. Most pundits and sponsor, Yardley, were surprised and disappointed after Oliver was sacked by BRM. Jackie Stewart, judged Oliver a very good GP and Can Am driver.|$|E

Finally Virginia's Court of Appeals led by Edmund Pendleton decided mostly in favor of Braxton before Morris was forced into bankruptcy by his own continued land speculations (although Morris as late as 1800 believed he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> ₤20,000). In 1791, Braxton also purchased Strawberry Hill outside Richmond for his wife (who had received nothing upon her father's death, all his property being given to his sons), and conveyed it to his sons Carter Jr. and Corbin to hold for their mother's benefit. Braxton's biographer {{does not believe that}} Braxton hid assets from his creditors by placing them in relatives' names, although his widow later attempted to recover dower rights in land and slaves that her husband sold in his last years. His sons in law, Robert Page and John White (husbands of Molly and Judith, his daughters by his first wife) paid creditors more than ₤2000 on Braxton's behalf.|$|E

25|$|A pre-match {{protest in}} the Curva Nord at the refereeing {{performances}} in Parma matches was {{the prelude to}} Fiorentina's re-arranged visit on Wednesday 7 March. Parma started well and dominated the game with the surprising inclusion of Jaime Valdés in central midfield not hindering them. After 28 minutes, Giovinco played through ball ahead of Stefano Okaka, whose shot was saved, but the Italian striker finished well on the rebound. On the hour mark, Fiorentina equalised after an excellent wide free-kick found Matija Nastasić, who nodded home from close range. Parma continued to have chances, but Fiorentina miraculously took the lead via a cute Alessio Cerci finish. Late on, Giovinco won a contentious penalty for a shirt tag and stepped up to score the penalty to level the scores at two each. Confusion reigned late on; {{it looked as though}} Valon Behrami had been sent off, but the red card was rescinded after discussions between the referee and the linesman. Andrea Lazzari <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the game for Fiorentina in injury time, but fired just wide.|$|E

This score remains the lowest ever by an amateur in the U.S. Open. Nicklaus played the final 36 holes with Ben Hogan, who later remarked {{that he had just}} played 36 holes with a kid who <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> by 10 shots. During the final 36 holes, Nicklaus was two-under-par; he had shot every round of the tournament at or below par, the only entrant to do so. Nicklaus had led by two shots with six holes to play. In 1960, Nicklaus also tied for 13th in the Masters Tournament. He tied for fourth in the 1961 U.S. Open, three shots behind champion Gene Littler, having played the final 54 holes one under par. Each of these three major championship finishes designated Nicklaus as low amateur. However, Nicklaus' one-under-par 287 tied for seventh in the 1961 Masters Tournament, and was second that year only to Charles Coe's low amateur placing, when he tied for second with Arnold Palmer at seven-under par 281, one shot behind champion Gary Player.|$|E
