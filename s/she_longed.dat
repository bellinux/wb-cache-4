25|$|Henriette d'Angeville was a {{descendant}} of a French aristocratic family. After the French Revolution, her father was imprisoned and her grandfather executed, and {{the family moved to}} Bugey in the Rhône-Alpes region. After her father's death, in 1827, she settled in Geneva. An avid walker, for a long time <b>she</b> <b>longed</b> to climb Mont Blanc and finally did so in 1838, becoming the first woman since Maria Paradis in 1808 to climb Europe's highest mountain.|$|E
25|$|Teresa {{entered a}} Carmelite Monastery of the Incarnation in Ávila, Spain, on 2 November 1535. She found herself {{increasingly}} in disharmony with the spiritual malaise prevailing at the monastery. Among the 150 nuns living there, the observance of cloister — {{designed to protect}} and strengthen the spirit and practice of prayer — became so lax that it actually lost its very purpose. The daily invasion of visitors, many of high social and political rank, spoiled the atmosphere with frivolous concerns and vain conversations. These violations of the solitude absolutely essential to progress in genuine contemplative prayer grieved Teresa {{to the extent that}} <b>she</b> <b>longed</b> to do something.|$|E
25|$|Maria is {{described}} as a success in her social role as Empress, loved to dance at the balls of high society and became a popular socialite and hostess of the Imperial balls; her daughter Olga commented, “Court life had to run in splendor, and there my mother played her part without a single false step.”, and a contemporary remarked on her success: “of the long gallery of Tsarinas who have sat in state in the Kremlin or paced in the Winter Palace, Marie Feodorovna was perhaps the most brilliant”. <b>She</b> <b>longed</b> for the balls and gatherings in the Winter Palace. These also occurred at Gatchina. Alexander used to enjoy joining in with the musicians, although he would end up sending them off one by one. When that happened, Maria knew the party was over.|$|E

500|$|Goldman {{traveled}} to Canada in 1927, {{just in time}} to receive news of the impending executions of Italian anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti in Boston. Angered by the many irregularities of the case, she saw it as another travesty of justice in the US. <b>She</b> <b>longed</b> to join the mass demonstrations in Boston; memories of the Haymarket affair overwhelmed her, compounded by her isolation. [...] "Then," [...] she wrote, [...] "I had my life before me to take up the cause for those killed. Now I have nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|Near the Oldenburg's estate, Ramon in Voronezh province, Olga {{had her own}} villa, called [...] "Olgino" [...] {{after the}} local town. She subsidized the village school out of her own pocket, and {{established}} a hospital. Her daughter-in-law later wrote, [...] "She tried to help every needy person as far as her strengths and means would permit." [...] At the hospital, she learned basic medical treatment and proper care from the local doctor. She exemplified her strong Orthodox faith by creating religious icons, which she distributed to the charitable endeavours she supported. At Ramon Olga and Peter enjoyed walking through the nearby woods and hunted wolves together. He was kind and considerate towards her, but <b>she</b> <b>longed</b> for love, a normal marriage and children.|$|E
500|$|Edina Müller {{was born}} on 28 June 1983, [...] {{and raised in the}} Rhineland town of Brühl. In 2000, at the age of 16, she was playing volleyball, and felt pain in her back. A doctor {{straightened}} her back, but within two hours she lost feeling in her legs. She was rushed to hospital where a blood clot was discovered. Diagnosed with paraplegia, she spent the next four months in hospital. She had to repeat Year 10 at Max Ernst Gymnasium, but graduated in 2003. Although she began using a wheelchair, <b>she</b> <b>longed</b> to return to playing sport, and initially tried sitting volleyball. She then took up wheelchair tennis, winning the Hungarian Open in 2005, but ultimately switched to wheelchair basketball, playing for ASV Bonn. In 2005, she was invited to attend a German national team training camp [...] by its coach, Holger Glinicki. The following year she made the national team and won bronze at the World Championships in Amsterdam.|$|E

500|$|Striving {{towards the}} life beyond, Strindberg explained, he could permit {{nothing in the}} {{apartment}} that would lead the thoughts towards the earthly and material. In her comments in the Letters, Bosse described with loyalty and affection Strindberg's protectiveness and his efforts to bring his young wife with him along his own spiritual paths; nevertheless, she chafed under these efforts, pointing out that she herself, at 22, was not even remotely finished with this world. Increasingly agoraphobic, Strindberg attempted to overcome his anxieties and allow his young wife the summer excursions <b>she</b> <b>longed</b> for. He planned sunny drives in hired victorias, but often the mystical [...] "Powers" [...] which governed him intervened. [...] A crisis came as early as June 1901, when Strindberg arranged, {{and then at the}} last moment called off, a honeymoon trip to Germany and Switzerland. [...] Bosse wrote in the Letters that she had nothing to do but stay at home and choke down the tears while Strindberg attempted consolation by giving her a Baedeker [...] "to read a trip in".|$|E
2500|$|Raquel {{filled the}} dizzy blonde and tart {{with a heart}} {{stereotypes}} in Coronation Street. Her defining characteristics included her [...] "short skirts, big hair and... even bigger heart." [...] Alongside her bouffant hair and short skirts, Raquel's costume commonly included high-heels {{and a great deal}} of make-up, reflecting her glamour model aspirations. The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith described her as having an [...] "almost saintly idiocy", and Dominic Maxwell of The Times wrote that her [...] "comic brio and emotional tenderness" [...] made her a standout character. Ben Thompson of The Independent deemed her most affecting qualities to be her [...] "hauteur, kindness and dignity in the face of defeat." [...] AOL's Anne Richardson called Raquel [...] "the very definition of loveable", writing: [...] "Always trying to better herself, but without any social climbing snobbery, <b>she</b> <b>longed</b> for a better life whilst always seeming to be resigned to the fact that she'd never actually get there. Sweetly naive and tragically vulnerable, we longed for her to find her happy ending and our hearts broke every time hers did." ...|$|E
