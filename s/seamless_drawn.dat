This paper is an effort to demonstrate the use of finite element method to analyse cold drawing process and to determine the effect of the process by variation of the parameters like die entry angle and cross-section reduction on the industrial cold <b>drawn</b> <b>seamless</b> tube...|$|R

40|$|Interior {{surfaces}} of <b>seamless</b> <b>drawn</b> stainless steel tubing show numerous micro-pits, pores, and striations {{resulting from the}} working and forming of the metal, even under a modicum of magnification. It is generally accepted that tubing, in order to contain fine particle packings for high pressure liquid chromatography, should be as smooth as possible. Pits and porosity in the metal surface may trap portions of the mobile liquid phase, and of the solute, result-ing in some loss of separation, and tailing of peaks in a chromatographic separation. Lengthwise scratches or stria-tions can give channeling, also harmful to separation. Laub (1) pointed out that with small particle packings, even small amounts of channeling or dead space outside or within the column will contribute significantly to a drop in efficiency.

We devised the key metaphor: “talking through and {{drawing on a}} transparent glass window” to design Clear Board. A prototype of Clear Board is implemented based on the “Drafter-Mirror” architecture. This paper first reviews previous work on shared drawing support to clarify the design goals. We then examine three metaphors that fulfill these goals. The design requirements and the two possible system architectures of Clear Board are described. Finally, some findings gained through the experimental use of the prototype, including the feature of “gaze awarenessi, are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{is a part of}} a long term {{experimental}} project devoted to investigate flow boiling heat transfer, pressure drop and flow visualization of R 134 a in small to mini/micro-diameter tubes. The experimental facility was first designed and constructed by X. Huo (2005) with the contribution of L. Chen (2006). In the present study, the experimental facility was upgraded by changing the heating system from AC to DC heating and also upgrading the logging system through using a faster data logger and developing a new Labview program. The objectives of the current study include (i) contribute in identifying the reasons behind the wide scatter in the published flow boiling heat transfer results, (ii) contribute in understanding the fundamentals of flow boiling heat transfer in mini/micro-diameter tubes and (iii) evaluation of the existing heat transfer and pressure drop prediction methods. Two sizes of stainless steel tubes were investigated in the current study; 0. 52 mm and 1. 1 mm diameter. In the current study, the 0. 52 mm tube was roughly called a “micro-tube” whilst the 1. 1 mm tubes were called “mini-tubes”. The present study proposes two possible reasons for the scatter in the published heat transfer results. The first reason is the variations in the heated length from one study to another–there is no criterion for choosing the heated length. The second reason is the variations in the inner surface characteristics of the channels from one study to another. These two important parameters were not taken into consideration by researchers in the past studies. Accordingly, the effect of the heated length was investigated in the current study using a <b>seamless</b> cold <b>drawn</b> tube with diameter of 1. 1 mm and heated length ranging from 150 to 450 mm. The effect of the tube inner surface was also tested here by conducting the test in two stainless steel tubes with diameter of 1. 1 mm and manufactured by two different processes. The first tube was manufactured by welding technique whilst the second tube was a <b>seamless</b> cold <b>drawn</b> tube. Both tubes were identical in design and dimensions. The inner surface of each tube was examined first using SEM analysis and demonstrated that, the surface morphology is completely different. The local heat transfer coefficient was determined through measuring the local wall temperature using 14 K-type thermocouples attached to the wall using thermally conducting but electrically insulating epoxy supplied by Omega. Pressure drop was measured directly across the heated section and a high speed camera was used for the flow visualization at 1000 frames/s. All measurements were recorded after the system attained steady state. The experimental conditions include mass flux range of 100 – 500 kg/m 2 s, system pressure range of 6 – 10 bar, inlet sub-cooling of about 5 K and exit quality up to about 0. 9. The most frequently observed flow regimes in the 0. 52 mm tube were found to be slug (elongated bubble), transition to annular and annular flow regimes. In the 1. 1 mm tube, the observed regimes were found to be slug, churn and annular. The transition from slug flow to annular flow in the 0. 52 mm tube occurred smoothly with little disturbances at the liquid vapour interface compared to the 1. 1 mm tube. Additionally, increasing the heated length of the 1. 1 mm tube was found to shift the transition to annular flow to occur at lower vapour quality. The heat transfer results demonstrated that the behaviour of the local heat transfer coefficient in the 0. 52 mm diameter tube is different compared to that in the 1. 1 mm tubes. Also, the tube inner surface characteristics and the heated length were found to strongly influence the local behaviour of the heat transfer coefficient. Flow boiling hysteresis was investigated and the results indicated that hysteresis exists only at very low heat fluxes near the boiling incipience. Existing heat transfer and pressure drop correlations were examined using the results of the 0. 52 and 1. 1 mm <b>seamless</b> cold <b>drawn</b> tubes. The pressure drop data were predicted very well using the Muller-Stienhagen and Heck (1986) correlation, the homogeneous flow model and the correlation of Mishima and Hibiki (1996). On the contrary, all macro and microscale heat correlations failed to predict the current experimental data. The mechanistic models failed to predict the data of all tubes with the same accuracy. Accordingly, two heat transfer correlations were proposed in the current study. The first correlation is based on dimensionless groups whilst the second is based on the superposition model of Chen (1966). Both correlations predicted the current experimental data and the data of Huo (2005) and Shiferaw (2008) very well.

A piston valve incorporating transfer ports was fitted between each high-pressure and low-pressure cylinder in an arrangement similar to Vauclain's balanced compound system used on a number of railway locomotives around 1900. Stephenson's valve gear replaced the previous Joy motion. This engine was used on all vehicles developed thereafter. Again, the car neither possessed nor needed a clutch or transmission, and due to the engine being integrated directly into the rear axle, it did not need a drive shaft either. Like all steam vehicles it could burn a variety of liquid fuels with a minimum of modification and was a noticeably clean running vehicle, its fuel being burned at high temperatures and low pressures, which produced very low pollution. Price ranged from $8,800 to $11,200 in 1923. The Model E ran on a 142 in wheelbase. Twenty-four E's were made between 1922 and 1925 with a variety of body types from roadsters to limousines. Owners included Howard Hughes and the Maharajah of Bharatpur. One of the Hughes cars, a roadster engine number 20, is currently owned by Jay Leno. Abner Doble owned the last one - number 24.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a revival}} of {{interest}} in Bourdieu 2 ̆ 7 s work and this article examines dominant trends within feminist re-engagements. It considers the insights into gender identity afforded by ‘habitus’ and ‘social field’, distinguishing between analyses of 2 ̆ 7 gender habitus 2 ̆ 7, and the potential of habitus and social field for feminist analysis of change. Feminist responses to Bourdieu continue to be divided {{on the extent to}} which social field structure determines habitus, and there is a tendency to represent the relationship as too <b>seamless</b> and coherent. <b>Drawing</b> on debates within recent feminist sociology, notably the work of Lois McNay and Lisa Adkins, this article argues instead for greater acknowledgement of the instability of gender norms and the contradictory effects of crossing different social fields. A feminist rethinking of the relationship between gender change, habitus and social field is suggested, which arises from a more contextual analysis of the varying degrees of correspondence between habitus and field. This addresses the co-existence of change and continuity in gender relations and identities, and aims to move such debates beyond questions of either freedom or reproduction. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This {{treatise}} {{investigates the}} philosophical components of Christian creation-faith, considering their {{character and the}} connections between them, developing a particular expression of the distinction and relation between creation and its Creator. The work of David Burrell and Edward Schillebeeckx furnishes tools for that development, in two ways: firstly, by supplying a terminology of distinction and relation that shapes the discourse; consequently, by facilitating {{the study of the}} interaction between 'the distinction' and 'the relation' of creation, which, in both authors' work, is dialectical in character. The study assesses whether Burrell and Schillebeeckx each stress one of these concepts {{at the expense of the}} other, finding the evidence suggestive but not compelling. It examines dialectic more closely, describing Burrell's dialectic as polar and Schillebeeckx's as relational. The polar nature of Burrell's dialectic generates a tension between the relata, tending to pull them apart. Schillebeeckx's relational dialectic results, rather, in a mutual interaction in which the relata support and enrich one another. A preference is voiced for Schillebeeckx's relational dialectic, an organizing principle not only of his account of creation, but of his philosophical theology more generally. His method of correlation is examined, concentrating on the way it directs his accounts of praxis and of humanism. Relational dialectic then serves as the basis for the articulation of a Schillebeeckian philosophical theology, following in his footsteps without imitating him exactly. This gives rise retrospectively to a novel reading of Aquinas on analogical language about God. It offers the prospect of a <b>seamless</b> philosophical theology, <b>drawing</b> on the idea of participation to speak of the humanization and divinization of men and women. Relational dialectic also facilitates the expression of a mutual interaction between God's free commitment to creation and humanity's free commitment to a better future for the world. </p...|$|R
