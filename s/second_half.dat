40|$|The {{availability}} of separated isotopes of Mg {{makes it easy}} to determine the half life of Al{sup 26 }, a member of the Wigner series which has long been suspected to have a half life of approximately 7 seconds, but which has not been confirmed because of the masking 7 second activity of Al{sup 26 }. Mg{sup 24 }, Mg{sup 25 } and Mg{sup 26 } (in the form of MgO) have been bombarded with protons from the Berkeley Linear Accelerator, with the following results: (1) Mg{sup 24 } yields an activity of approximately 23 <b>seconds</b> <b>half</b> life, presumably due to Na{sup 21 } from the reaction Mg{sup 24 }(p,a) Na{sup 21 }; (2) the Mg{sup 25 } yields an activity of approximately 8 <b>seconds</b> <b>half</b> life, which they assign to the reaction Mg{sup 25 }(p,n) Al{sup 25 }; and (3) The Mg{sup 26 } yields an activity of approximately 6 <b>seconds</b> <b>half</b> life, assigned to Al{sup 26 } according to a similar reaction. It seems probable therefore that the 7 <b>seconds</b> <b>half</b> life normally given for Al{sup 26 } is a mixture of these two activities...|$|R
