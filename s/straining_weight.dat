A total of 450 broilers {{of three different}} strains (I 657, Light Sussex, New Hampshire) were reared in an organic research orchard. Half of each strain was slaughtered at 91 days {{and the other half}} at 120 days. All broilers were weighed and a clinical welfare assessment was made at slaughter. A trained sensory panel evaluated the breast meat in relation to flavour, smell and texture characteristics defined by the panel. At both 91 and 120 days of age the commercial breed I 657 was significantly heavier than the slower growing strains. Males were significantly heavier than the females across <b>strains.</b> <b>Weight</b> ratios between males and females were nearly the same at both slaughter ages in I 657, whereas weight ratios increased significantly at 120 days in Light Sussex and New Hampshire. No overall effect of strain was found on the flavour and smell of the breast meat. However, the age-related changes in tenderness and toughness differed significantly between strains, since the commercial strain tended towards a tougher and less tender consistency with age, whereas the opposite was the case for the slower growing pure breeds. The positive flavour of salt was significantly improved at 120 days across strains with females having a saltier flavour than the males with age. The positive flavour of sweet corn was improved in the meat from the males, whereas the positive smell of sweet corn was significantly improved in both males and females. No negative effects of age were found. In conclusion, broilers were tastier when slaughtered at 120 days compared with 91 days. The development in meat tenderness was related to <b>strain,</b> and <b>weights</b> at slaughter were related to both strain and sex. ...|$|R

40|$|The sliding {{behavior}} of high purity aluminum was investigated, {{with a focus}} on the chemical composition and structure of wear debris generated in different environments. Sliding tests were carried out with a pin-on-disk tribometer. The pin was a 440 C stainless steel ball and the disk was 99. 99 % aluminum. Relative humidity in air varied from 20 % to 95 %. The sliding behavior depended strongly on the test environment, especially the relative humidity. Wear debris was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The debris from air tests differed both chemically and structurally from the original contacting material. A high concentration of oxygen was detected by EDS in the wear debris and on the wear track. XPS was employed to gather information on the bonding of the oxygen incorporated with aluminum during sliding. XRD analysis suggests that the metallic component of the wear debris produced in air retains high elastic <b>strains.</b> <b>Weight</b> changes of the wear debris during heat treatment were measured by TGA and these tests suggest that the debris includes hydroxide.

The results revealed that oral administration of RCP extract at 250, 500 and 750 mg/kg B. Wt. reduced the length of gastric ulcer. On the other hand, all extracts increased pH value of gastric juice compared to control (-ve) group, meanwhile the volume of gastric juice decreased by plant extracts specially for rats feed on RCP at dose 750 mg B.

The wet fruiting bodies of mushroom Agaricus blazei Murill, crushed and suspended in distilled water was administered orally to the treated groups of male albino rats. The activities of various enzymes (aspartate and alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase), levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants (glutathione, vitamin C, vitamin E) and level of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) were determined in the serum of all the experimental animals. Decrease in all the enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidant, along with an increase in the lipid peroxidative index (malondialdehyde) was found in all the carbon tetrachloride treated rats as compared with normal controls. Also increase level of non-enzymatic antioxidant along with the decrease level in malondialdehyde was found in all experimental animals which were treated with Agaricus blazei Mushroom extract as compared with normal controls.

Mice from each strain were divided into groups based on weight roughly corresponding to those of 3 -, 4 -, 5 -, and 6 -wk-old mice. Mice were treated with 5 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). The weights of mice that produced maximal numbers of oocytes {{in response to these}} doses were 14. 2 g or less for C 57 BL/ 6 NHsd, 13. 7 g or less for B 6 (Cg) -Tyrc- 2 J/J, 6. 0 to 9. 9 g for B 6 D 2 F 1 /Hsd, 14. 5 to 16. 4 g for FVB/NHsd, 14. 8 g or less for BALB/cAnNCr, and 23. 5 g or more for Crl:CD 1 (ICR). We then compared PMSG dosages of 5 and 2. 5 IU per mouse and determined whether 2 doses of PMSG (5 or 2. 5 IU, depending on prior results) administered 1 wk apart, followed by the standard HCG injection, would produce more oocytes when compared to a single dose of PMSG. FVB, B 6 D 2 F 1, BALB/c, and CD 1 mice responded best to a single dose of 5 IU of each hormone, whereas B 6 (Cg) -Tyrc- 2 J/J mice produced more oocytes after 2. 5 IU PMSG. Although C 57 BL/ 6 mice given the standard dose produced good numbers of oocytes, the number was higher after 2 doses of PMSG at 5 IU per dose.

40|$|Critically ill {{patients}} {{admitted to the}} intensive care unit (ICU) commonly develop severe muscle wasting and weakness and consequently impaired muscle function. This not only delays respirator weaning and ICU discharge, but has deleterious effects on morbidity, mortality, financial costs, and quality of life of survivors. Acute Quadriplegic Myopathy (AQM) {{is one of the most}} common neuromuscular disorders underlying ICU muscle wasting and paralysis, and is a consequence of modern intensive care interventions, although the exact causes remain unclear. Muscle gene/protein expression, intracellular signalling, post-translational modifications, muscle membrane excitability, and contractile properties at the single muscle fibre level were explored in order to unravel the mechanisms underlying the muscle wasting and weakness associated with AQM and how this can be counteracted by specific intervention strategies. A unique experimental rat ICU model was used to address the mechanistic and therapeutic aspects of this condition, allowing time-resolved studies for a period of two weeks. Subsequently, the findings obtained from this model were translated into a clinical study. The obtained results showed that the mechanical silencing of skeletal muscle, i. e., absence of external <b>strain</b> (<b>weight</b> bearing) and internal strain (myosin-actin activation) due to the pharmacological paralysis or sedation associated with the ICU intervention, is likely to be the primary mechanism triggering the preferential myosin loss and muscle wasting, features specifically characteristic of AQM. Moreover, mechanical silencing induces a specific gene expression pattern as well as post-translational modifications in the motor domain of myosin that may be critical for both function and for triggering proteolysis. The higher nNOS expression found in the ICU patients and its cytoplasmic dislocation are indicated as a probable mechanism underlying these highly specific modifications. This work also demonstrated that passive mechanical loading is able to attenuate the oxidative stress associated with the mechanical silencing and induces positive effects on muscle function, i. e., alleviates the loss of force-generating capacity that underlie the ICU intervention, supporting the importance of early physical therapy in immobilized, sedated, and mechanically ventilated ICU patients...|$|R
