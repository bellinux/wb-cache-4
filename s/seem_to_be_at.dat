He points out too that Bugge cherry-picks details occurring only in widely scattered variants that happen to fit with his biblical theory.|$|E
25|$|Atlantis {{had also}} been {{mentioned}} in the Jon Pertwee serial The Dæmons (1971), with the godlike being Azal citing its destruction as a warning of an experiment gone wrong. Some have argued that The Underwater Menace and The Time Monster depict the flooding and collapse, respectively, of different parts of Atlantis, not {{the destruction of the}} whole, so that all three accounts may fit into one coherent narrative. Alternatively, and since the geographical and temporal locations <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> odds, the name 'Atlantis' may be taken as a translation convention – via the Time Lord gift that always translates local languages for the Doctor and his companions (and viewers) – referring to different lost prehistoric civilisations. The novel The Quantum Archangel suggests that the Daemons gave the Kronos crystal to the Atlanteans as a test, which they failed.|$|E

500|$|Tøjner {{describes}} {{the work as}} [...] "Lichtenstein's finest formulation of a counter-image to the many explosions in his universe", noting that the drama is past its peak although it may <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> a crescendo. He also notes that [...] "the tears are drawn with classic Lichtenstein waxy fullness" [...] despite the surrounding water, which must be significant since [...] "naturalistic justification" [...] is absent. A November 1963 Art Magazine review stated that {{this was one of}} the [...] "broad and powerful paintings" [...] of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery. Nonetheless, the name of the work was not universally known. [...] In a December 1964 Art Magazine review of his October 24– September 19, 1964 Castelli Gallery show, Lichtenstein was referred to as the author of I Don't Care, I'd Rather Sink (Drowning Girl). According to Gary Garrels of the Museum of Modern Art, the work is a [...] "poetics of the utterly banal, of displaced ordinariness" [...] resulting in an [...] "image frozen in time and space", making it [...] "iconic". Comparing this to the source, Garrels says it is a rendering [...] "in a simplified vocabulary" [...] produced while Lichtenstein put aside his mechanical objectivity. According to The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, extreme examples of his formalization become [...] "virtual abstraction" [...] when the viewer recalls that the motif is an element of a larger work. Thus, Lichtenstein reinforced a non-realist view of comic strips and advertisements, presenting them as artificial images with minimalistic graphic techniques. Lichtenstein's magnification of his source material stressed the plainness of his motifs as an equivalent to mechanical commercial drawing, leading to implications about his statements on modern industrial America. Nonetheless, Lichtenstein appears to have accepted the American capitalist industrial culture.|$|E

With her sleepy carnality and dry, hesitant timing, she is a superb foil for Mr. Perlman's plain-spoken bravado".

2500|$|Regarding {{hypotheses}} of {{extraterrestrial intelligence}} (ETI) and extradimensional intelligence (EDI), Hynek continued, [...] "There is sufficient evidence to defend both". As {{evidence for the}} ETI hypothesis, he mentioned the cases involving radar as good evidence of something solid, {{as well as the}} cases of physical evidence. Then he turned to defending the EDI hypothesis: in addition to the observations of materialization and dematerialization, he cited the [...] "poltergeist" [...] phenomenon experienced by some people after a close encounter; the photographs of UFOs, sometimes in only one frame, and not seen by witnesses; the changing of form in front of witnesses; the puzzling question of telepathic communication; that in close encounters of the third kind, the creatures <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> home in Earth's gravity and atmosphere; the sudden stillness {{in the presence of the}} craft; levitation of cars or people; and the development by some of psychic abilities after an encounter.

2500|$|Other critics {{expressed}} {{more negative}} {{opinions of the}} game, with many citing frequent crashes and other technical issues, along with shallow gameplay. Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it. Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes. Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed. Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go {{was not a good}} game, it was [...] "a great experience". The server problems also received negative press. Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game's strong social appeal and visual design, the game's [...] "initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems. Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the [...] "three-step glitch", reviewers also gave this bug negative press. Patricia Hernandez (Kotaku) said, [...] "the three step glitch adds to what has been a terrible launch for Pokémon Go". Paul Tassi (Forbes) said that due to this bug it's [...] "anyone's best guess where Pokémon are 99% of the time" [...] and that it [...] "renders almost all traditional methods of tracking pointless". Critics also emphasized on the large gap between the rural and urban players. Rural players <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> a major disadvantage when playing the game, while city players have access to more PokéStops and Gyms.

2500|$|Caligula {{received}} generally negative reviews. Roger Ebert gave it zero stars, {{calling it}} [...] "sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash". Ebert wrote, [...] "In the {{two hours of}} this film that I saw, there were no scenes of joy, natural pleasure, or good sensual cheer. There was, instead, a nauseating excursion into base and sad fantasies." [...] It is also notable for {{being one of the}} few films Ebert has ever walked out of—he walked out 2 hours into its 170-minute length after feeling [...] "disgusted and unspeakably depressed". He and Gene Siskel selected the film as one of their [...] "dogs of the year" [...] in a 1980 episode of Sneak Previews. Variety described the film as a [...] "moral holocaust". Rex Reed called Caligula [...] "a trough of rotten swill". Jay Scott, reviewing Caligula for The Globe and Mail, said, [...] "Caligula doesn't really work on any level". Scott unfavourably compared Caligula with In the Realm of the Senses, describing the latter film as a better treatment of extreme sexuality. Scott's review went on to say [...] "Rome would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least as fecund a territory for the cinematic exploration of sex, death and money, as pre-war Japan ... but what's missing from Caligula, which is rife with all three, is any connective tissue (also any point of view, any thought, any meaning)". Scott concluded his review by claiming the whole film's production was [...] "a boondoggle of landmark proportions". New York critic David Denby described the film as [...] "an infinitely degraded version of Fellini Satyricon. Tom Milne (Monthly Film Bulletin) stated that the film was [...] "by no means so awesomely bad as most critics have been pleased to report—but pretty bad all the same" [...] and found the film to be [...] "notable chiefly for the accuracy with which it reflects this anonymity." ...|$|E
2500|$|The institutes {{above-mentioned}} offer a very incomplete idea of {{the historical}} work done in the Vatican archives. Many Frenchmen, Germans, Austrians, Belgians, and others flock to Rome and {{spend much of their}} time in private investigations of their own. Most of these workers attach themselves to some institute and profit by its experience. Among Americans we may mention Professor Charles Homer Haskins, who familiarized himself with the treasures contained in the archives and library, and made a report on the same for the [...] "American Historical Review", reprinted in the [...] "Catholic University Bulletin", Washington, 1897, pp.177–196; Rev. P. de Roo, who laboured for several years on the [...] "Regesta" [...] of Alexander VI; Heywood, who compiled the [...] "Documenta selecta e tabulario Sanctæ Sedis, insulas et terras anno 1492 repertas a Christophoro Columbo respicientia", which he published in phototype in 1892. Other American scholars have profited largely by the immemorial academic hospitality of the popes. Special mention should be made here of the studies of Luka Jelic and Conrad Eubel concerning early missionary enterprises, and of an essay by Shipley on [...] "The Colonization of America" [...] (Lucerne, 1899). For other valuable information see the tenth volume of the [...] "Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia". The time would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> hand for the foundation of an American Catholic historical institute, which would take over the task of collecting and publishing in a systematic way the numerous important documents concerning the American Church preserved in many places at Rome, particularly in the Propaganda archives. Russia has sent historical commissions to Rome repeatedly, and for several years at a time. The names of Schmurlow, Brückner, Pierling, Forster, Wiersbowski, and others are sufficient reminders of the excellent work accomplished. From Japan came Dr. Murakami, to explore the Propaganda and Vatican archives for a history of the Catholic missions to Japan (1549–1690). Denmark is represented among the investigators by such names as Moltesen, Krarup, and Lindback; Norway by Storm, and Sweden by Tegnér, Elof, Karlson, and others. Moritz Stern, Felix Vernet, and others obtained at the Vatican material for a history of the Hebrews. The Spanish Government was long officially represented by the famous Spanish historian, Ricardo de Hinojosa, while researches in Portuguese history are conducted by MacSwiney. Switzerland entered into this peaceful competition by the labours of Kirsch and Baumgarten in 1899, and since the close of the last century many Swiss have visited Rome for Vatican researches, both as individuals and on official missions. We need only mention the names of Büchi, Wirz, Bernoulli, Steffens, Reinhard, and Stückelberg.|$|E
