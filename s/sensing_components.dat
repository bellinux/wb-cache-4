40|$|Word al-muhsinun and al-muttaqun {{in several}} {{locations}} of Alquran have almost similar meanings, {{both of them}} are accompanied by Allah, given the same guidance, and similar in Allah’s love abundance. But, even though they have almost similar meanings, Allah loves al-muhsinun more than al-muttaqun. It is according to the M. Quraish Shihab thoughts about the quantity of Allah’s love expression for al-muhsinun which is much more than al-muttaqun. It is about five compare to three. Thus, Why does Allah love al-muhsinun more than al-muttaqun, while al-muhsinun and al-muttaqun itself have almost similar meaning? From those reasons, obviously there are sense relation between those two words in Alquran. This research has two goals, it is to find the form of sense relations in the word almuh sinun and al-muttaqun, and to find why does Allah love al-muhsinun more than al-muttaqun. To reach those goals, the researcher uses semantic theory which is focusing to the sense relations. In E. A. Nida sense relations theory, there are three technics should be done, they are analyzing <b>sense</b> <b>components,</b> finding <b>sense</b> fields, and deciding the form of sense relations. Then the research result is that word al-muhsinun has fifteen similar <b>sense</b> <b>components</b> with al-muttaqun. And, word al-muhsinun has six distinguished <b>sense</b> <b>components.</b> While word al-muttaqun only has one distinguished <b>sense</b> <b>component.</b> From word fields side, word al-muhsinun has ten word fields, while word al-muttaqun only has six word field. Then the form of sense relation which found in word al-muhsinun and al-muttaqun is inclusion sense relation, overlapping, and contiguity. Researcher finds four reasons why does Allah love al-muhsinun more than almuttaqu n. First, because distinguished <b>sense</b> <b>components</b> of al-muhsinun much more than distinguished <b>sense</b> <b>components</b> of al-muttaqun, it is six compare to one. Second, Allah’s accompanying to al-muhsinun is being strengthened by two confirmation letters (taukid), while Allah’s accompanying to al-muttaqun is being strengthened only by one confirmation letter. Third, because al-muhsinun is hypernim (superordinate) from word al-muttaqun. Fourth, because al-muhsinun got both guidance and mercy from Allah, while al-muttaqun only got guidance from Allah...|$|R

50|$|In general, {{cellular}} {{response to}} stimuli {{is defined as}} a change in state or activity of a cell in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, or gene expression. Receptors on cell surfaces are <b>sensing</b> <b>components</b> that monitor stimuli and respond to changes in the environment by relaying the signal to a control center for further processing and response. Stimuli are always converted into electrical signals via transduction. This electrical signal, or receptor potential, takes a specific pathway through the nervous system to initiate a systematic response. Each type of receptor is specialized to respond preferentially to only one kind of stimulus energy, called the adequate stimulus. Sensory receptors have a well-defined range of stimuli to which they respond, and each is tuned to the particular needs of the organism. Stimuli are relayed throughout the body by mechanotransduction or chemotransduction, depending {{on the nature of the}} stimulus.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Recent {{progress}} in hardware devices and computer technologies has substantially contributed to making robotic systems {{more powerful and}} flexible. High-torque actuators have facilitated robot motions [1] and high-speed computers have realized natural and intellectual behaviors. At the same time, however, increase in the system's complexity is making it more di#cult to design a system whose individual components display their potential abilities. Even with a high-speed actuator, for example, a system cannot utilize its ability if the <b>sensing</b> <b>component</b> is too slow compared to the actuator. In another case, a high-speed <b>sensing</b> <b>component,</b> such as 1 ms vision system [2], could not demonstrate its ability unless the processing component cannot finish data processing within a specific time.
