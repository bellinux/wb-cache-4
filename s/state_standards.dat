5|$|Basalt, mostly {{covered by}} silt in the uplands and {{sediment}} in the lowlands, underlies the Balch Creek watershed. The {{upper part of}} the watershed includes private residential land, the Audubon Society of Portland nature sanctuary, and part of Forest Park. Mixed conifer forest of Coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock with a well-developed understory of shrubs and flowering plants is the natural vegetation. Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use Forest Park. A small population of coastal cutthroat trout resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major water body in Portland that met <b>state</b> <b>standards</b> for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|When Harriman State Park {{opened in}} 1910, the Monroe–Haverstraw highway was renamed Southfields Road. Three years later, {{a portion of}} the route became part of Seven Lakes Drive, a major highway built to {{traverse}} the park. In 1916, Rockland County numbered its highways for the first time. The Rockland County section of the former Monroe and Haverstraw Road was designated as CR416 at this time. From 1919 to 1920, the highway was reconstructed and rebuilt to <b>state</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E

5|$|Music {{education}} throughout Maryland {{conforms to}} <b>state</b> <b>standards,</b> {{implemented by the}} Baltimore City Public School System. Music is taught to all age groups, and the city {{is also home to}} several institutes of higher education in music. The Peabody Institute's Conservatory is the most renowned music education facility in the area, and {{has been one of the}} top nationally for decades. The city is also home to a number of other institutes of higher education in music, the largest being nearby Towson University. The Peabody sponsors performances of many kinds, many of them classical or chamber music. Baltimore is home to the Baltimore Opera and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, among other similar performance groups. Major music venues in Baltimore include the nightclubs and other establishments that offer live entertainment clustered in Fells Point and Federal Hill.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of current-day Route31 began around1916, when {{a portion of}} the highway, along the community of Hampton was taken over by the state and was repaired to <b>state</b> <b>standards</b> for $300 (1916USD). In1923, the state of New Jersey passed the Good Roads Act, which greatly expanded the state highway system in New Jersey. This act took over pre-existing highways and rebuilt them to a standard mandated by the state. Construction began on Route31 in1926, when the State Highway Department began work at the southern terminus in Trenton. A total of11 bridges were constructed along the highway during this time, signifying the route's construction northward. The oldest ones, dating back to1926, were located in Ewing Township and Oxford Township. The one in Ewing Township was along the first portion of the highway to be constructed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{constitutional}} prohibition on state involvement in roads was removed. The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{was created in}} 1905, and the department paid counties and townships to improve roads to <b>state</b> <b>standards.</b> On May 13, 1913, the State Reward Trunk Line Highways Act was passed, creating the State Trunkline Highway System. The MSHD assigned internal highway numbers to roads in the system, and in 1919, the numbers were signposted along the roads and marked on maps. The US Highway System was created in 1926, and highways in Michigan were renumbered {{to account for the}} new designations. Legislation in the 1930s consolidated control of the state trunklines in the state highway department. During the 1940s, the first freeways were built in Michigan. With the introduction of the Interstate Highway system in the 1950s, the state aborted an effort to build the Michigan Turnpike, a tolled freeway in the southeast corner of the LP. Construction on Michigan's Interstates started {{in the latter part of}} that decade and continued until 1992. During that period, several freeways were canceled in the 1960s and 1970s, while others were delayed or modified over environmental and political concerns. Since 1992, few additional freeways have been built, and in the early years of the 21st century, projects are underway to bypass cities with new highways.|$|E
