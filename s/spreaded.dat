40|$|A MIMO-CDMA {{system with}} Nt {{transmit}} antennas can transmit Nt symbols {{on a given}} signaling interval, and those N t symbols {{are referred to as}} a message vector. In conventional MIMO-CDMA systems, a message group is <b>spread</b> by using orthogonal direct sequence <b>spreading</b> codes. In this thesis, less known and recently introduced the parity-bit-selected <b>spreading</b> and the permutation <b>spreading</b> techniques are used for MIMO-CDMA system. This thesis develops the closed form theoretical expressions for parity-bit-selected <b>spreading</b> and permutation <b>spreading</b> techniques. We also introduce new design strategies for permutation <b>spreading</b> technique. In the MIMO-CDMA system employing parity bit selected <b>spreading,</b> rather than assigning each transmit antenna with different <b>spreading</b> sequences, the message vector is input to a systematic block encoder whose output parity bits select the <b>spreading</b> sequence to be used. In other words, with a given message vector, all the transmit antennas would use the same <b>spreading</b> sequence. In the MIMO-CDMA system using permutation <b>spreading,</b> rather than using the parity bits to select one <b>spreading</b> sequence, the parity bits are used to select Nt different <b>spreading</b> sequences from a set of <b>spreading</b> sequences. A unique permutation of <b>spreading</b> sequences is assigned for different parity bits. Compared to MIMO-CDMA systems employing conventional <b>spreading</b> method, the simulation results show that, in frequency-nonselective Rayleigh fading channel, parity bit selected <b>spreading</b> improves the system performance, while permutation <b>spreading</b> can further improve the system performance in both single-user and multi-user environments...|$|R
