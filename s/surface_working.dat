Improving the fit between the pregnant woman and the workplace layout contributes to minimizing the load associated with given tasks. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate two layout aspects for standing manual work, namely <b>working</b> <b>surface</b> height and <b>working</b> <b>surface</b> areas, for the condition of pregnancy. Two approaches were used. (1) The effects of changed body dimensions were evaluated with regard to (a) fit problems while working at a workplace in accordance with common guidelines and (b) the validity of assumptions of these guidelines. (2) The appreciation of relevant aspects of workplace layout at a specific manual task was assessed. Twenty-seven women were examined in pregnant and non-pregnant conditions. The first approach showed that fit problems are likely: guideline <b>working</b> <b>surface</b> height is just (2 - 7 cm) under the most protruding abdominal point, and areas based on non-pregnant abdominal depth are relatively large in pregnant condition. Further, existing methods to assess <b>working</b> <b>surface</b> areas have various assumptions that are not valid in pregnant condition. The second approach showed that at a specific manual task, women in late pregnancy preferred a considerably lower table height than the common guideline heights. Possibly, abdominal height becomes a relevant design factor with regard to <b>working</b> <b>surface</b> height during pregnancy. The task position on the <b>working</b> <b>surface</b> at which effort started became closer to the table edge due to pregnancy. Both approaches show that common guideline <b>working</b> <b>surface</b> heights for manual work, and <b>working</b> <b>surface</b> areas assessed in non-pregnant condition seem not suitable in pregnant conditio...|$|R

[...] In reality, there were 20 miners working the night shift {{at the time of}} the disaster. Three had been outside the mine and were killed by the slide. [...] The remaining 17 were underground.

They unsuccessfully tried to dig their way through the blocked entrance before one miner suggested he knew of a seam of coal that reached the <b>surface.</b> <b>Working</b> a narrow tunnel in pairs and threes, they dug through the coal for hours as the air around them became increasingly toxic. Only three men still had enough energy to continue digging when they broke through to the surface late in the afternoon. [...] The opening was too dangerous to escape from due to falling rocks from above. Encouraged by their success, the miners cut a new shaft that broke through under an outcropping of rock that protected them from falling debris. Thirteen hours after they were buried, all 17 men emerged from the mountain.|$|E

The purpose was to obtain a <b>working</b> <b>surface</b> that during the soil workmanship requires the minimum values of draught force and of input energy costs. For this, it has been necessary to perform {{the study of the}} interaction soil-plough by a numerical simulation with the mathematical model of a plough mouldboard.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>surface</b> <b>working</b> {{operations}} on the microstructure, electrochemical behavior and {{stress corrosion cracking}} resistance of 304 L stainless steel (SS) was investigated in this study. The material was subjected to (a) solution annealing (b) machining and (c) grinding operations. Microstructural characterization was done using stereo microscopy and electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) technique. The electrochemical nature of the surfaces in machined, ground and solution annealed condition were studied using potentiodynamic polarization and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in borate buffer solution. The stress corrosion cracking resistance of 304 L SS in different conditions was studied by exposing the samples to boiling MgCl 2 environment. Results revealed that the heavy plastic deformation and residual stresses present near the surface due to machining and grinding operations make 304 L SS electrochemically more active and susceptible to stress corrosion cracking. Ground sample showed highest magnitude of current density in the passive potential range followed by machined and solution annealed 304 L SS. Micro-electrochemical studies established that <b>surface</b> <b>working</b> promotes localized concision along the surface asperities {{which could lead to}} crack initiation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Jan Lipták Title: Review of the {{possibility}} of the use of the stone veneer for constructional materials sheathing The aim of the diploma thesis was to review whether the stone veneer is suitable or comparable material for sheathing constructional materials. The beech veneer was used for the comparison. Firstly, the history of the veneers and the decorative veneers manufacturing are described in the theoretical part. Then it is focused on the stone treatment, its history and the manufacturing of the stone veneer. The next part of the thesis deals with the methods of the stone and beech veneer testing: bending strength tests, glue strength tests, humidity and density assessing and tests of the <b>surface</b> <b>working</b> resistance to a falling small ball. Further, results of measurements are presented in form of tables and graphs. The results proved that the stone veneer is comparable to the beech veneer that reached better results in bending strength. The stone veneer is better in the glue strength. The density tests pointed out the higher density of the stone veneer. The humidity is influenced by the density and the stone veneer samples were of lower humidity. The tests of the <b>surface</b> <b>working</b> resistance to a falling small ball did not recorded notable differences, the degree of the damage was assessed to be of the level 4.
