25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disease described by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra. Today, {{the most commonly used}} drug to combat this disease is levodopa or L-DOPA. This precursor to dopamine can penetrate through the blood–brain barrier, whereas the neurotransmitter dopamine cannot. There has been extensive research to determine whether L-dopa is a better treatment for Parkinson's disease rather than other dopamine agonists. Some believe that the long-term use of L-dopa will compromise neuroprotection and, thus, eventually lead to dopaminergic cell death. Though there has been no proof, in-vivo or in-vitro, some <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the long-term use of dopamine agonists is better for the patient.|$|E
25|$|Many of Joseph Smith's early revelations prophesied {{that the}} Latter Day Saints would build Zion, a new Jerusalem, a {{religious}} utopia centered in Jackson County, MO. The Prophet urged {{his followers to}} give everything they had to this cause. However, when they failed to live the Law of Consecration, which was a promise to voluntarily give all their property to the community for equal distribution, Joseph Smith received a revelation that God would build Zion later, when the people were ready. Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church {{have come to understand}} Zion as primarily a community way of life that is centered around Jesus Christ, but many people <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> when they are ready, {{they will be able to}} build the literal city of Zion as well.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the game, ABC {{requested}} {{that it be}} rescheduled from 5:00p.m. to 8:00p.m. Eastern Time, {{so that it could}} be broadcast live in primetime hours. However, the request was declined by the IIHF, after the Soviets complained that it would cause the game to air at 4a.m. Moscow Time, as opposed to 1a.m. Moscow Time. As a result, ABC decided not to broadcast the game live for the U.S. audience, and tape delayed it for broadcast during its primetime block of Olympics coverage instead. Before the game aired, ABC's Olympics host Jim McKay openly stated that the game had already occurred, but that they had promised not to spoil its results. In order to accommodate coverage of the men's slalom competition, portions of the game were also edited for time. To this day {{some of the people that}} watched the game on television <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it was live.|$|E
25|$|There {{is nothing}} solid {{left in the}} Players' Protective Association. There has been no {{activity}} {{on the part of}} the present officials, and there will be none. The organization has been allowed to die because the members have seen nothing in it to interest them. Some are not pleased with the officers; others object to the paying of dues, while others <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they can do better by themselves than by acting in concert with all the other players; and so the Players' Protective Association gradually is being allowed to die out. One hears but little of it now, and in a year from now will hear less. It would have been a good thing for the players if they had been true to its principles and the officials had been active in carrying out all its aims and laws. However, there was failure on all sides, and the result is that the organization gradually is fading out of existence.|$|E
500|$|Most {{scholars}} {{agree with}} Wollstonecraft's assessment of her writing. Nevertheless, they <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{the novel is}} important because it attempts to depict a liberated and reasoning female genius. As feminist scholar Mitzi Myers argues, [...] "in her focus on the subjective vision and internal life of her heroine, in her reliance on emotional nuance rather than plot, Wollstonecraft both transforms the traditions of late eighteenth-century sentimental fiction for feminist purposes and anticipates twentieth-century trends in the novel of feminine consciousness." [...] Mary helped initiate a tradition that would blossom in novels such as Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre (1847) and Villette (1853).|$|E

500|$|In early 1992 word {{leaked to}} the press on a {{possible}} merger between WordStar International Inc., and soon after both firms made public {{the fact that they}} had signed a letter of intent on a merger deal. However, just over a month later word came out that the merger talks had fallen through, at the time cited to differences over [...] "complex legal, accounting and management issues". WordStar, whose share of the word processing market had by that time fallen to 5% (from a high of 80%) was seeking Delrina's advanced technologies while Delrina was hoping to utilize the other firm's established global sales network. Despite the failure of the merger talks, Bennie said soon after that [...] "we're still convinced that a larger sales force would give us the kind of marketing clout we need. I <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it's possible for us to become a global operation". Not long after WordStar merged with Spinnaker Software Corporation and SoftKey Software Products Inc. to form SoftKey International. Delrina subsequently signed deals with Wallace Computer Services, UARCO and NCR Corporation in an effort to gain greater sales distribution of its products.|$|E
500|$|Hornung's {{arguments}} {{have greatly}} influenced other scholars of Egyptian religion, but some <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{at times the}} gods were more unified than he allows. Jan Assmann maintains {{that the notion of}} a single deity developed slowly through the New Kingdom, beginning with a focus on Amun-Ra as the all-important sun god. In his view, Atenism was an extreme outgrowth of this trend. It equated the single deity with the sun and dismissed all other gods. Then, in the backlash against Atenism, priestly theologians described the universal god in a different way, one that coexisted with traditional polytheism. The one god was believed to transcend the world and all the other deities, while at the same time, the multiple gods were aspects of the one. According to Assmann, this one god was especially equated with Amun, the dominant god in the late New Kingdom, whereas for the rest of Egyptian history the universal deity could be identified with many other gods. James P. Allen says that coexisting notions of one god and many gods would fit well with the [...] "multiplicity of approaches" [...] in Egyptian thought, {{as well as with the}} henotheistic practice of ordinary worshippers. He says that the Egyptians may have recognized the unity of the divine by [...] "identifying their uniform notion of 'god' with a particular god, depending on the particular situation." ...|$|E
