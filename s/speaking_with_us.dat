5000|$|Despite the {{advocacy}} for public-private broadband partnerships and service {{there are many}} telecommunication firms seeking to bar the enactment of a community broadband act. Citing government-backed networks would compete unfairly with private companies. Also requiring heavy taxpayer subsidization that would minimize net benefits to local residents. Douglas Boone, chief executive of Premier Communications when <b>speaking</b> <b>with</b> <b>U.S.</b> Telecom Association said “setting up a government-owned network is like having city hall opening a chain of grocery stores or gas stations." [...] Government-backed broadband might also lead to stifled innovation inhibiting technological advancement.|$|E

By Christ's intercession I gather, that awakened men and women, {{such as the}} godly are, dare not, after offence given, come {{in their}} own names to make unto God an {{application}} for mercy. God, in himself, is a consuming fire, and sin has made the best of us as stubble is to fire; wherefore, they may not, they cannot, they dare not approach God's presence for help but by and through a mediator and intercessor. When Israel saw the fire, the blackness and darkness, and heard the thunder, and lightning, and the terrible sound of the trumpet, 'they said unto Moses, <b>Speak</b> thou <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> and we will hear: but let not God <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> lest we die.' (Exo 20:19, Deut 18:16) Guilt, and sense of the disparity that is betwixt God and us, will make us look out for a man that may lay his hand upon us both, and that may set us right {{in the eyes of}} our Father again. This, I say, I infer from the intercession of Christ; for, {{if there had been a}} possibility of our ability to have approached God with advantage without, what need had there been of the intercession of Christ? ...|$|R
