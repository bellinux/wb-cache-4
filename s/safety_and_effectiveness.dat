5|$|In adults {{short term}} use of nasal decongestants {{may have a}} small benefit. Antihistamines may improve {{symptoms}} in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. The <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} are being studied for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid. Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012. The <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>effectiveness</b> {{of these new}} agents are still uncertain, because {{they are based on}} the results of a relatively small studies. However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E

25|$|In 1978 FDA {{published}} a tentative final monograph (TFM) for topical antimicrobial products. The record was re-opened in March 1979 {{to take into}} account six comments the agency received during the period for submitting objections to the TFM, including new data submitted by Procter & Gamble on the <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of triclocarban and by Ciba-Geigy on the proliferation of use of triclosan. The document states that, “significant amounts of new and previously unconsidered data were submitted with each of the above petitions.” It was re-opened again in October of that year to permit interested persons to submit further data establishing conditions for the safety, effectiveness and labeling of over-the-counter topical antimicrobial products for human use.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{position}} of the FDI World Dental Federation as well as numerous dental associations and dental public health agencies worldwide that amalgam restorations are safe and effective.

These include the Mayo clinic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada, Alzheimer's Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, Autism Society of America, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, New England Journal of Medicine, International Journal of Dentistry, National Council Against Health Fraud, The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research NIDCR, American Cancer Society, Lupus Foundation of America, the American College of Medical Toxicology, the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, Consumer Reports Prevention, and WebMD.|$|E
25|$|Japan's {{nuclear safety}} agency NISA {{reported}} two holes, each 8 meters square, or 64 m² (690 sq ft), {{in a wall}} of the outer building of Unit 4 after the explosion.

Seventy staff remained at the plant, while 800 had been evacuated. By 22:30, TEPCO was reportedly unable to pour water into the spent fuel pool. By 22:50, the company was considering using helicopters to drop water, but this was postponed because of concerns over <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> and the use of high-pressure fire hoses was considered instead.|$|E

25|$|Unresearched nonprescription {{products}} or programs {{for weight loss}} are heavily promoted by mail and print advertising and on the internet. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends caution with use of these products, {{since many of the}} claims of <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>effectiveness</b> are unsubstantiated. Individuals with anorexia nervosa and some athletes try to control body weight with laxatives, diet pills or diuretic drugs, although these generally have no impact on body fat. Products that work as a laxative can cause the blood's potassium level to drop, which may cause heart and/or muscle problems. Pyruvate is a popular product that may result in a small amount of weight loss. However, pyruvate, which is found in red apples, cheese, and red wine, has not been thoroughly studied and its weight loss potential has not been scientifically established.|$|E
25|$|The next {{document}} issued was a proposed rule dated June 17, 1994, which states, “FDA is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking {{in the form}} of an amended tentative final monograph that would establish conditions under which OTC topical health-care antiseptic drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. FDA is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking on topical antimicrobial drug products after considering the public comments on that notice and other information in the administrative record for this rulemaking. FDA is also requesting data and information concerning the <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of topical antimicrobials for use as hand sanitizers or dips.” In the 1994 update to the rule, TCS was effectively removed from the drug category which made it available for use in consumer products.|$|E
25|$|The study <b>Safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>Effectiveness</b> of Mentor's MemoryGel Implants at 6 Years (2009), {{which was}} a branch study of the U.S. FDA's core {{clinical}} trials for primary breast augmentation surgery patients, reported low device-rupture rates of 1.1 per cent at 6-years post-implantation. The first series of MRI evaluations of the silicone breast implants with thick filler-gel reported a device-rupture rate of 1.0 per cent, or less, at the median 6-year device-age. Statistically, the manual examination (palpation) of the woman is inadequate for accurately evaluating if a breast implant has ruptured. The study, The Diagnosis of Silicone Breast-implant Rupture: Clinical Findings Compared with Findings at Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2005), reported that, in asymptomatic patients, only 30 per cent of the ruptured breast implants is accurately palpated and detected by an experienced plastic surgeon, whereas MRI examinations accurately detected 86 per cent of breast-implant ruptures. Therefore, the U.S. FDA recommended scheduled MRI examinations, as silent-rupture screenings, beginning at the 3-year-mark post-implantation, and then every two years, thereafter. Nonetheless, beyond the U.S., the medical establishments of other nations have not endorsed routine MRI screening, and, in its stead, proposed that such a radiologic examination be reserved for two purposes: (i) for the woman with a suspected breast-implant rupture; and (ii) for the confirmation of mammographic and ultrasonic studies that indicate {{the presence of a}} ruptured breast implant.|$|E

As expected, team psychological <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> team <b>effectiveness</b> was positively associated, supporting hypothesis 1 a and 1 b. Furthermore, dialogue was positively related to team effectiveness, supporting hypothesis 2 a and 2 b. Finally, the results indicate that dialogue partially mediates the relationship between team psychological <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> team <b>effectiveness</b> when controlling for management team size and team level...|$|R
