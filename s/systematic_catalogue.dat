40|$|In {{this paper}} we push forward and exploit an analogy between the morphologies of the X-ray {{cavities}} observed in some galaxy clusters, and the optically deficient pointsymmetric bubbles occurring in some planetary nebulae (PNe). Point-symmetric PNe {{are thought to}} be shaped by stellar binary interactions; namely, the presence of a companion to the PN’s progenitor star is required. We suggest that similar pointsymmetric structures in the X-ray cavities of galaxy clusters might be associated with the presence of massive binary black holes. A <b>systematic</b> <b>cataloguing</b> of highresolution images of the diffuse X-ray emission at the core of galaxy clusters might contribute to individuate massive binary black holes. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{proliferation}} of structural and functional studies of RNA has revealed an increasing range of RNA's structural repertoire. Toward {{the objective of}} <b>systematic</b> <b>cataloguing</b> of RNA's structural repertoire, we have recently described {{the basis of a}} graphical approach for organizing RNA secondary structures, including existing and hypothetical motifs. Description We now present an RNA motif database based on graph theory, termed RAG for RNA-As-Graphs, to catalogue and rank all theoretically possible, including existing, candidate and hypothetical, RNA secondary motifs. The candidate motifs are predicted using a clustering algorithm that classifies RNA graphs into RNA-like and non-RNA groups. All RNA motifs are filed according to their graph vertex number (RNA length) and ranked by topological complexity. Conclusions RAG's quantitative cataloguing allows facile retrieval of all classes of RNA secondary motifs, assists identification of structural and functional properties of user-supplied RNA sequences, and helps stimulate the search for novel RNAs based on predicted candidate motifs. </p...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts by ResearchAdaptation theory has historically viewed film as hierarchically and artistically inferior to the book, measuring {{the success or failure}} of an adaptation on the grounds of fidelity. More recent critics have challenged the possibility and the desirability of fidelity when adapting one medium to another, proposing other tropes to validate the adaptive process such as intertextuality and contextuality. By examining the online Twilight fan community as an example of a ‘knowing audience’, acquainted with both novel and adapted film, this thesis considers the tensions that exist between fidelity and deviation by analysing the fans’ responses to the altered ending of the film adaptation Breaking Dawn – Part 2 (2012). Having conducted a <b>systematic</b> <b>cataloguing</b> exercise of this online fandom, unprompted online fan discussion from a sub-set of key fan sites was analsyed, uncovering the startling reaction of fans to the film’s unexpected ending. This study identifies fan audiences as intensive readers, collaborators and viewers of adapted texts and suggests the creative and commercial advantages to be gained from a collaborative and open dialogue between adaptors and fans. It also challenges the assumed superiority of the novel and the author’s authority over canon and narrative, and reveals the unexpected added pleasure derived from a deviation from canon...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{mutagenesis}} efficiently generates phenotypic {{variation in}} otherwise homogeneous genetic backgrounds, enabling functional analysis of genes. Advances in mutation detection {{have brought the}} utility of induced mutant populations on par with those produced by insertional mutagenesis, but <b>systematic</b> <b>cataloguing</b> of mutations would further increase their utility. We examined the suitability of multiplexed global exome capture and sequencing coupled with custom-developed bioinformatics tools to identify mutations in well-characterized mutant populations of rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum). In rice, we identified ~ 18, 000 induced mutations from 72 independent M 2 individuals. Functional evaluation indicated the recovery of potentially deleterious mutations for > 2600 genes. We further observed that specific sequence and cytosine methylation patterns surrounding the targeted guanine residues strongly affect their probability to be alkylated by ethyl methanesulfonate. Application of these methods to six independent M 2 lines of tetraploid wheat demonstrated that our bioinformatics pipeline is applicable to polyploids. In conclusion, we provide a method for developing large-scale induced mutation resources with relatively small investments that is applicable to resource-poor organisms. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that large libraries of sequenced mutations can be readily generated, providing enhanced opportunities to study gene function and assess the effect of sequence and chromatin context on mutations. © 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

40|$|Economic {{growth in}} Tribal Trust Areas {{is the problem}} facing us and the {{question}} is how are we to understand it, grasp its nature? Any one of us may take a walk through a tribal area and see a tumult of rocks and boulders, a mass of shrubs and grasses, or a collection of individuals engaged each on his or her little affairs. We could also give a report on what we saw, maybe even theorize on the evidence of our eyes and suggest improvements. How valid are such observations, yet they form the basis for most of the views and arguments! A geologist, armed with his science, would find â€œlaws and common propertiesâ€ amidst the chaos of rocks and soils; the botanist would do the same admist the chaos of vegetation. What then are we to do about the human phenomena we see in the tribal areas? How put some meaning, some system, some interpretation into the chaos of human actions? Just as some people haphazardly collect wild flowers, so some have collected â€œcustomsâ€, and could go on collecting customs all their lives, so rich and varied are they. Obviously such collections are extremely interesting, and lend themselves to <b>systematic</b> <b>cataloguing</b> analysis and description, but how useful are they!
