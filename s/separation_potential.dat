By contrast, in liquid-liquid chromatography, both the mobile and stationary phases are liquid. The contrast is, however not as stark as it first appears. In reversed-phase chromatography, for example, the stationary phase {{can be regarded as}} a liquid which is immobilized by chemical bonding to a micro-porous silica solid support. In countercurrent chromatography centrifugal or gravitational forces immobilize the stationary liquid layer. By eliminating solid supports, permanent adsorption of the analyte onto the column is avoided, and a high recovery of the analyte can be achieved. The countercurrent chromatography instrument is easily switched between normal phase chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography simply by changing the mobile and stationary phases. With {{column chromatography}}, the <b>separation</b> <b>potential</b> is limited by the commercially available stationary phase media and its particular characteristics. Nearly any pair of immiscible solutions can be used in countercurrent chromatography provided that the stationary phase can be successfully retained.|$|E

40|$|A unified viscous {{theory of}} 2 -D thin {{airfoils}} and 3 -D thin wings is developed with numerical examples. The viscous {{theory of the}} load distribution is unique and tends to the classical inviscid result with Kutta condition in the high Reynolds number limit. A new theory of 2 -D section induced drag is introduced with specific applications to three cases of interest: (1) constant angle of attack; (2) parabolic camber; and (3) a flapped airfoil. The first case is also extended to a profiled leading edge foil. The well-known drag due to absence of leading edge suction {{is derived from the}} viscous theory. It is independent of Reynolds number for zero thickness and varies inversely with the square root of the Reynolds number based on the leading edge radius for profiled sections. The role of turbulence in the section induced drag problem is discussed. A theory of minimum section induced drag is derived and applied. For low Reynolds number the minimum drag load tends to the constant angle of attack solution and for high Reynolds number to an approximation of the parabolic camber solution. The parabolic camber section induced drag is about 4 percent greater than the ideal minimum at high Reynolds number. Two new concepts, the viscous induced drag angle and the viscous induced <b>separation</b> <b>potential</b> are introduced. The <b>separation</b> <b>potential</b> is calculated for three 2 -D cases and for a 3 -D rectangular wing. The potential is calculated with input from a standard doublet lattice wing code without recourse to any boundary layer calculations. Separation is indicated in regions where it is observed experimentally. The classical induced drag is recovered in the 3 -D high Reynolds number limit with an additional contribution that is Reynold number dependent. The 3 -D viscous theory of minimum induced drag yields an equation for the optimal spanwise and chordwise load distribution. The design of optimal wing tip planforms and camber distributions is possible with the viscous 3 -D wing theory...|$|E

By adjusting the dope concentration for each polymer, porous membranes were attained which were suitable for UF operations and were tested using a laboratory-scale cross-flow test unit. The water flux of the membranes showed a strong dependency on the chemical composition, with water permeability increasing with increasing PEO content in the copolymer. Their <b>separation</b> <b>potentials</b> were investigated using standard solutions of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as the feed, {{and the performance of}} the membranes in UF operations was systematically compared. A relationship between the dope concentration and the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) could be observed, with higher concentrations resulting in a lower MWCO. In contrast, it was observed that the higher the content of PEO in the copolymer the greater the MWCO. In fouling tests performed using a bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution, aramid-g-PEO UF membranes exhibited very good antifouling properties compared to a commercially sourced polysulfone membrane and to polyamide UF membranes.
