5|$|In November 2007, Airbus top sales {{executive}} {{and chief operating}} officer John Leahy confirmed plans for an enlarged variant, the A380-900, with more seating <b>space</b> <b>than</b> the A380-800. This would have a seating capacity for 650 passengers in standard configuration, and approximately 900 passengers in an economy-only configuration. Airlines that had expressed an interest in the −900 included Emirates, Virgin Atlantic, Cathay Pacific, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Kingfisher Airlines, and leasing company ILFC. In May 2010, Airbus announced that A380-900 development was postponed, until production of the A380-800 stabilises.|$|E
5|$|Wild wolves are {{sometimes}} kept as exotic pets and, in some rarer occasions, as working animals. Although {{closely related to}} domesticated dogs, wolves do not show the same tractability as dogs in living alongside humans, and generally, much more work is {{required in order to}} obtain the same amount of reliability. Wolves also need much more <b>space</b> <b>than</b> dogs, about , so they can exercise.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as his work on the Scott Building, Alexander was asked to take up the {{challenge}} of completing the Smithsonian Institution Building, the progress of which had bogged down under architect James Renwick, Jr. In August 1853, Alexander accepted, and by 1855, the Smithsonian Building was complete. During construction, Alexander slightly altered Renwick's original design by placing the Smithsonian's main lecture hall on the second floor. The change allowed for superior acoustics and a wider <b>space</b> <b>than</b> could be found on the first floor. To support the large lecture hall and the central core of the building, Alexander arranged for the installation of fireproof masonry-encased iron structural columns. These would prove their value on January 24, 1865, when a fire broke out on the roof above the lecture hall. The resulting blaze destroyed the hall and damaged {{much of the rest of}} the structure. Thanks to the fireproof columns, however, the Smithsonian building did not collapse.|$|E

5|$|Butthole Surfers {{began to}} take the {{collection}} of visual equipment seriously following Coffey's recruitment in 1983, when he added a clear plastic drum fitted with a strobe light to their show. Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen strobe lights at a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up more <b>space</b> <b>than</b> their instruments. Smoke machines were later added. Equally memorable was the band's propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number of overlapping movies {{at the same time}} which were often strangely angled, upside down or played in reverse. Combined with the increasing number of strobe lights, the effect created a visually disorienting atmosphere, which occasionally caused epileptic seizures in audience members.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Regalian Properties {{purchased}} the site, and appointed Terry Farrell as architect. Farrell designed a self-contained community of shops, housing, offices and public spaces for the site. Regalian disliked the proposals and requested Farrell design a single large office block. Despite containing 50% more office <b>space</b> <b>than</b> the rejected Green Giant proposal, the design was accepted. The government then bought {{the site and}} design as a future headquarters for the Secret Intelligence Service, and the design was accordingly modified to increase security. In 1995 the SIS Building was opened on the site, and today dominates other buildings {{in the vicinity of}} the bridge.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943 the British Government {{decided to}} {{transfer}} the recently raised 81st (West Africa) Division from West Africa to India {{to take part in}} the Burma Campaign. This unit required much more shipping <b>space</b> <b>than</b> other British divisions, as its fighting units were supported by thousands of porters. To facilitate the division's movement, additional troopships were assigned to the regular WS convoys. The 81stDivision's advance parties departed Freetown with Convoys WS29 and WS30 in April and May, and the 6th (West Africa) Brigade embarked on ships of Convoy WS31 at Lagos between 2 and 10July. It was planned to transport the division's two remaining brigades in convoys WS32 and WS33.|$|E

5|$|Known {{methods for}} {{repeatedly}} finding the closest pair of clusters in a dynamic set of clusters either require superlinear space {{to maintain a}} data structure that can find closest pairs quickly, or they take greater than linear time to find each closest pair. The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm uses a smaller {{amount of time and}} <b>space</b> <b>than</b> the greedy algorithm by merging pairs of clusters in a different order. In this way, it avoids the problem of repeatedly finding closest pairs. Nevertheless, for many types of clustering problem, it can be guaranteed {{to come up with the}} same hierarchical clustering as the greedy algorithm despite the different merge order.|$|E
5|$|The Nimitz-class {{aircraft}} carriers {{were ordered to}} supplement the {{aircraft carriers}} of the Kitty Hawk class and Enterprise class, maintaining the strength and capability of the U.S. Navy after the older carriers were decommissioned. The ships were designed to be improvements on previous U.S. aircraft carriers, in particular the Enterprise and Forrestal-class supercarriers, although {{the arrangement of the}} ships is relatively {{similar to that of the}} Kitty Hawk class. Among other design improvements, the two reactors on Nimitz-class carriers take up less <b>space</b> <b>than</b> the eight reactors used on Enterprise. Along with a more generally improved design, this means that Nimitz-class carriers can carry 90% more aviation fuel and 50% more ordnance when compared to the Forrestal class.|$|E
5|$|The art was {{developed}} by Paul Drummond, Kevin Preston, Maria Drummond, Jeff Wall, and Karen Pinchin. This team were based at a studio in Manchester, rather than Birmingham, the central studio. Their work included character animations, developed in Autodesk Animator using its language POCO, which the graphics tools were built in. The artwork (including the sprites) was made as a selection of clips, and a final image was formed by pasting them together. The ability to use clips in multiple locations, and the colour information being stored separately and used on an as--needed basis meant that the art took much less <b>space</b> <b>than</b> was usual. The background artwork was sketched in black and white, and then scanned into a computer and colourised. The music is credited to Media Sorcery.|$|E

5|$|Directed acyclic graphs {{may also}} be used as a compact {{representation}} of a collection of sequences. In this type of application, one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same subsequences, these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less <b>space</b> <b>than</b> it would take to list out all of the sequences separately. For example, the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings, such as English words. Any set of sequences can be represented as paths in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie. A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie by allowing paths to diverge and rejoin, so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex.|$|E
5|$|The librarians {{sought a}} larger and more centrally-located <b>space</b> <b>than</b> the Briarcliff Farms building. On March 18, 1930, after {{invitation}} from the Briarcliff school district's Board of Education, the library was relocated again. It moved to a large room {{on the main floor}} of Briarcliff High School's extension to its Law Park school building. In August 1949, the school required more classroom space, so the Board of Education asked the library to relocate. The village board then provided the library with two rooms {{on the second floor of}} its recreation building near the village downtown on Old Route 100 (then part of NY Route 100). From the beginning, the recreation center rooms were too small to hold the library's collection (only holding about 7,000 of its 8,500 books), had insufficient room for tables and chairs, and no space for exhibits or displays. As well, the area was busy with traffic, due to its location at the intersection of two highways. It was also far from the village's public school buildings and had no sidewalks nearby, making it poorly-accessible and hazardous for children to visit.|$|E
