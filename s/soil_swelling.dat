40|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>swelling</b> is {{a complex}} {{phenomenon}} resulting from adsorption of water {{onto the surface of}} clay platelets. It is influenced by procedural, environmental and structural factors. In particular, the initial hydration state of a soil (expressed in terms of saturation degree, water content or suction), its initial level of compaction (expressed in terms of void ratio or dry unit weight) and the level of confinement are among the influencing parameters most studied. Characterising the swelling potential of a soil in the laboratory is an extensive task and tools for prediction are somehow limited. This paper presents the first attempt to use dimensional analysis to predict the amount of <b>soil</b> <b>swelling.</b> This approach makes use of the Buckingham pi theorem to reduce an equation describing a physical phenomenon into an equation involving a reduced number of parameters, which are dimensionless. One of these numbers, called DSP w, was specifically derived and validated using datasets from the literature.

The background of this work is an available chain of interconnected physical shrinkage curve models for clay, intra-aggregate matrix, aggregated soil without cracks, and soil with cracks. The objective {{of the work is}} to generalize these models to the case of swelling, and to construct the physical-swelling-model chain with a step-by-step transition from clay to aggregated soil with cracks. The generalization is based on thorough accounting for the analogies and differences between shrinkage and swelling and the corresponding use, modification, or replacement of the soil shrinkage features. Two specific <b>soil</b> <b>swelling</b> features to be used are: (i) air entrapping in pores of the contributing clay; and (ii) aggregate destruction with the formation of new aggregate surfaces. The input for the prediction of the swelling curve of an aggregated soil coincides with that of the available model of the shrinkage curve.

Expansive clays in the Pierre Shale and adjacent formations along the Front Range are responsible for the damage. The hazard is most severe in areas where these units dip steeply because of differential movement of adjacent beds (cm-m) which has been attributed to the abundance and composition of swelling clays (Gill ## ##., 1996).
