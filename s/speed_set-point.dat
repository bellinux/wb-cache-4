40|$|Abstractâ€”Vector {{control has}} been widely used in control of {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motors (PMSM). This technique requires an accurate knowledge of the rotor position. In many applications, such as mini-UAV, {{it is not possible}} to install any mechanical sensor. Therefore, a sensorless technique using position observer has to be implemented in order to estimate the rotor position. In this paper, we propose a new observer for PMSM sensorless control: the position estimate is generated upon electromagnetic relations (dynamics of magnetic flux in the motor) in the two-phase stationary reference frame. The implementation of the proposed observer is not a real burden; its validity is experimentally tested and satisfactory results are obtained regarding real position (and <b>speed</b> <b>set-point)</b> tracking in different operating situations.

An injection molding machine operates under such different operating conditions as different molds and materials.

This paper discusses a computer control system for injection ram velocity using a realtime fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The rules of FLC are optimized by analyzing the phase plane characteristics.

The operating system used is TinyOS 2. x in which the scheduler and the task definition are modified to support real-time constraints. To drastically reduce the energy consumed, the digital voltage scaling technique (DVS) is implemented. This technique is jointly used with asynchronous (clockless) hardware to reduce the activity of the circuit and the overheads, for example by preventing the OS from changing the frequency as requested by clocked circuits. In order to efficiently manage such a system, a DVS coprocessor is designed. This coprocessor is a feedback loop system which controls the supply voltage with respect to a <b>speed</b> <b>set-point</b> (in Mips) defined by the software.

An injection molding machine operates with different injection velocity profiles, barrel temperatures, molds, and materials.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} maintaining a stable rectified DC output from the three-phase AC generator in a series-hybrid vehicle powertrain. The series-hybrid prime power source generally comprises an internal combustion (IC) engine driving a three-phase permanent magnet generator whose output is rectified to DC. A recent development has been to control the engine/generator combination by an electronically actuated throttle. This system can be represented as a nonlinear system with significant time delay. Previously, voltage control of the generator output has been achieved by model predictive methods such as the Smith Predictor. These methods rely on the incorporation of an accurate system model and time delay into the control algorithm, with a consequent increase in computational complexity in the real-time controller, and as a necessity relies to some extent on {{the accuracy of the}} models. Two complementary performance objectives exist for the control system. Firstly, to maintain the IC engine at its optimal operating point, and secondly, to supply a stable DC supply to the traction drive inverters. Achievement of these goals minimises the transient energy storage requirements at the DC link, with a consequent reduction in both weight and cost. These objectives imply constant velocity operation of the IC engine under external load disturbances and changes in both operating conditions and vehicle <b>speed</b> <b>set-points.</b> In order to achieve these objectives, and reduce the complexity of implementation, in this article a controller is designed by the use of Genetic Programming methods in the Simulink modelling environment, with the aim of obtaining a relatively simple controller for the time-delay system which does not rely on the implementation of real time system models or time delay approximations in the controller.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Futureâ€™s {{penetration}} of more distributed generation {{will have an}} effect on the power systemâ€™s stability and controllability. In general, wind power as a distributed generator does not have inertial response and does not supply control power. A third characteristic of wind power is that it is not conventionally controlled and its main resource is fluctuating. This paper describes a methodology to calculate wind power fluctuations in the frequency domain to compare it with load fluctuations for higher frequency power fluctuations. In relation, the approach of wind power smoothing is mentioned to mitigate the grid impact of power fluctuations. To smooth power, the concept of inertial wind power smoothing is briefly discussed for the low wind speed range of wind turbines, between the cut-in and rated wind speed. A smart grid could be equipped with a control system to control the power output of wind turbines and wind farms to mitigate the grid impact of wind power fluctuations on the frequency stability of a power system.

40|$|Idle {{speed control}} is a {{landmark}} application of feedback control in automotive vehicles that continues to be of significant interest to automotive industry practitioners, since improved idle performance and robustness translate into better fuel economy, emissions and drivability. In this paper, we develop a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for regulating the engine speed to the idle <b>speed</b> <b>set-point</b> by actuating the electronic throttle and the spark timing. The MPC controller coordinates the two actuators according to a specified cost function, while explicitly taking into account constraints on the control and requirements on the acceptable engine speed range, e. g., to avoid engine stalls. Following a process proposed here {{for the implementation of}} MPC in automotive applications, an MPC controller is obtained with excellent performance and robustness as demonstrated in actual vehicle tests. In particular, the MPC controller performs better than an existing baseline controller in the vehicle, is robust to changes in operating conditions, and to different types of disturbances. It is also shown that the MPC computational complexity is well within the capability of production electronic control unit and that the improved performance achieved by the MPC controller can translate into fuel economy improvements...|$|E

Energy efficient operation of such systems is thus important for the energy saving of commercial buildings. This paper presents an extremum seeking control (ESC) scheme for energy efficient operation of the chilled-water system, and presents a Modelica based dynamic simulation model for demonstrating {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed control strategy. The simulated plant consists of a water-cooled screw chiller and a mechanical-draft counter-flow wet cooling tower.

40|$|Injection ram {{velocity}} to a {{large degree}} determines the melt injection rate during the injection phase in an injection molding process, and has strong influences on the molded part quality, such as shrinkage, warpage, and impact strength. An injection molding machine operates under strongly different operating conditions, such as different set-point profiles, barrel temperatures, molds and materials. This causes the ram velocity dynamics to vary significantly, and consequently results in poor control performance for a typical PID controller. This thesis presents a computer control system for the injection ram velocity using a real-time fuzzy logic controller (FLC), together with a fuzzy feedforward controller (FFC). The rule base of the FLC is optimized by analyzing the phase plane characteristics and, the optimal membership functions of FLC are based on the 2 k factors design technique. The experimental results reveal that the controller has improved performance over the conventional PID controller, in the response <b>speed,</b> <b>set-point</b> tracking ability, noise rejection, and robustness. In this study, the non-linearity and time-varying characteristics of the injection ram velocity have been investigated by an experimental model as well as a simplified physically-based model. Finally, the possibility of applying an adaptive fuzzy controller (AFC) to the ram velocity control is explored in this study. An AFC is designed and tested for the control of ram velocity during filling. The experimental results show that the controller worked in the cup mold, but failed in the modified flat mold. A possible reason for this may be the strong effect of different molds on the dynamics of ram velocity and the use of cup mold data for the adaptive rate y and the input and output variables fuzzy sets. The application of AFC to injection molding may give a direction for further study...|$|E
40|$|Brushless DC {{machines}} (BLDC) {{are widely}} used in home, automotive, aerospace and military applications. The reason of this interest in different industries {{in this type of}} machine is due to their significant advantages. Brushless DC machines have a high power density, simple construction and higher efficiency compared to conventional AC and DC machines and lower cost comparing to permanent magnet AC synchronous machines. The phase currents of a BLDC machine have to commutate properly which is realised by using power semiconductors. For a proper commutation the rotor position is often obtained by an auxiliary instrument, mostly an arrangement of three Hall-effect sensors with 120 spatial displacement. In modern and cost-effective BLDC drives the focus is on replacing the noise sensitive and less reliable mechanical sensors by numerical algorithms, often referred to as sensorless or self-sensing methods. The advantage of these methods is the use of current or voltage measurements which are usually available as these are required for the control of the drive or the protection of the semiconductor switches. Avoiding the mechanical position sensor yields remarkable savings in production, installation and maintenance costs. It also implies a higher power to volume ratio and improves the reliability of the drive system. Different self-sensing techniques have been developed for BLDC machines. Two algorithms are proposed in this thesis for self-sensing commutation of BLDC machines using the back-EMF samples of the BLDC machine. Simulations and experimental tests as well as mathematical analysis verify the improved performance of the proposed techniques compared to the conventional back-EMF based self-sensing commutation techniques. For a robust BLDC drive control algorithm {{with a wide variety of}} applications, load torque is as a disturbance within the control-loop. Coupling the load to the motor shaft may cause variations of the inertia and viscous friction coefficient besides the load variation. Even for a drive with known load torque characteristics there are always some unmodelled components that can affect the performance of the drive system. In self-sensing controlled drives, these disturbances are more critical due to the limitations of the self-sensing algorithms compared to drives equipped with position sensors. To compensate or reject torque disturbances, control algorithms need the information of those disturbances. Direct measurement of the load torque on the machine shaft would require another expensive and sensitive mechanical sensor to the drive system as well as introducing all of the sensor related problems to the drive. An estimation algorithm can be a good alternative. The estimated load torque information is introduced to the self-sensing BLDC drive control loop to increase the disturbance rejection properties of the speed controller. This technique is verified by running different experimental tests within different operation conditions. The electromagnetic torque in an electrical machine is determined by the stator current. When considering the dynamical behaviour, the response time of this torque on a stator voltage variation depends on the electric time constant, while the time response of the mechanical system depends on the mechanical time constant. In most cases, the time delays in the electric subsystem are negligible compared to the response time of the mechanical subsystem. For such a system a cascaded PI speed and current control loop is sufficient to have a high performance control. However, for a low inertia machine when the electrical and mechanical time constants are close to each other the cascaded control strategies fail to provide a high performance in the dynamic behavior. When two cascade controllers are used changes in the <b>speed</b> <b>set-point</b> should be applied slowly in order to avoid stability problems. To solve this, a model based predictive control algorithm is proposed in this thesis which is able to control the speed of a low inertia brushless DC machine with a high bandwidth and good disturbance rejection properties. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by simulation and verified by experimental results as well. Additionally, the improvement on the disturbance rejection properties of the proposed algorithm during the load torque variations is studied. In chapters 1 and 2 the basic operation principles of the BLDC machine drives will be introduced. A short introduction is also given about the state of the art in control of BLDC drives and self-sensing control techniques. In chapter 3, a model for BLDC machines is derived, which allows to test control algorithms and estimators using simulations. A further use of the model is in Model Based Predictive Control (MBPC) of BLDC machines where a discretised model of the BLDC machine is implemented on a computation platform such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) in order to predict the future states of the machine. Chapter 4 covers the theory behind the proposed self-sensing commutation methods where new methodologies to estimate the rotor speed and position from back-EMF measurements are explained. The results of the simulation and experimental tests verifies the performance of the proposed position and speed estimators. It will also be proved that using the proposed techniques improve the detection accuracy of the commutation instants. In chapter 5, the focus is on the estimation of load torque, in order to use it to improve the dynamic performance of the self-sensing BLDC machine drives. The load torque information is used within the control loop to improve the disturbance rejection properties of the speed control for the disturbances resulting from the applied load torque of the machine. Some of the machine parameters are used within speed and load torque estimators such as back-EMF constant Ke and rotor inertia J. The accuracy with which machine parameters are known is limited. Some of the machine parameters can change during operation. Therefore, the influence of parameter errors on the position, speed and load torque is examined in chapter 5. In Chapter 6 the fundamentals of Model based Predictive Control for a BLDC drive is explained, which are then applied to a BLDC drive to control the rotor speed. As the MPC algorithm is computationally demanding, some enhancements on the FPGA program is also introduced in order to reduce the required resources within the FPGA implementation. To keep the current bounded and a high speed response a specific cost function is designed to meet the requirements. later on, the proposed MPC method is combined with the proposed self-sensing algorithm and the advantages of the combined algorithms is also investigated. The effects of the MPC parameters on the speed and current control performance is also examined by simulations and experiments. Finally, in chapter 7 the main results of the research is summarized. In addition, the original contributions that is give by this work in the area of self-sensing control is highlighted. It is also shown how the presented work could be continued and expanded...|$|E
