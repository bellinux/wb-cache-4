40|$|Abstract. To {{satisfy the}} {{geotechnical}} strength requirements and the serviceability requirements, types of foundation systems (such as shallow foundation, pile foundation and composite foundation) have been developed. Of course, {{the type of}} foundation system is determined by many factors such as ground condition, economy and environmental influence of construction. To cope with weak or compressible soils, the authors present a raft foundation system with walled and columniform <b>soil</b> <b>improvement</b> for multistory buildings, which is economical and environment-friendly. In this raft foundation system, different columniform <b>soil</b> <b>improvements</b> in size and depth are used, and the subgrade under {{the edge of the}} foundation is walled by <b>soil</b> <b>improvement.</b> It can effectively control differential settlement and prevent relative rising of the structure by adjusting the size and depth of columniform <b>soil</b> <b>improvements</b> according to the soil layer difference of geological situation under the building. We have performed series numerical analyses under two-dimensional plane strain condition to study the settlement behaviors of the composite foundation system, and its effects on controlling differential settlement and improving bearing capacity were verified for immediate condition. As a continuous research, consolidation settlement analyses are performed, the process of excess hydraulic pressure dispersion with time and the consolidation settlement development are studied in this paper...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBiological <b>soil</b> <b>{{improvement}}</b> {{is a novel}} improvement {{technique in}} which chemical and biological processes leads to an improvement of physical and mechanical soil properties. Since this method is environmentally compatible and applicable to various soil types using different materials, it has turned into an efficient <b>soil</b> <b>improvement</b> method in numerous ground treatment projects. Microbiologically induced calcite precipitation (MICP) {{is one of the}} most well-known biological <b>soil</b> <b>improvements</b> method in which after the injecting bacterial suspension, reaction solution (cementation solution) into soil particles, calcium carbonate sediment is formed, and thereby soil properties are improved. In this paper, the ability to manage time and location when calcium carbonate sediments are biologically formed was investigated in sandy soil. The electrical conductivity method, unconfined compressive strength test and X-ray diffraction examinations were sequentially used to determine urease bacterial activity, measure the amount of the increased strength of treated soil and determine crystal type. The results showed good ability of this method to control time and location of biological precipitating. Furthermore, unconfined compressive strength of Caspian Sea coast sandy soil was increased up to 400 kPa. The ability to manage time and location of biological precipitating indicates this method can be potentially used in different application such as mitigation of liquefaction, soil erosion control, immobilizing of pollutions in soil and other <b>soil</b> <b>improvement</b> projects...|$|R
40|$|Tropical {{acid soil}} used for rubber {{planting}} has usually low fertility due to continuous loss of plant nutrient elements by crop removal and leaching. Thus, proper <b>soil</b> <b>improvement</b> in tapping rubber is very essential. This study aimed {{to measure the}} growth and yield of 17 -year-old rubber trees, chemical properties of soil, and plant nutrient status in the leaf and latex {{after two years of}} <b>soil</b> <b>improvement.</b> A randomized complete block of seven treatments: No fertilizer (Control treatment), Chemical fertilizer based on soil analysis according to the recommendation of the Rubber Research Institute (Ch. F), Ch. F+ Dolomite to raise pH up to 6. 0 (D), 3 kg per plant of compost (C), Ch. F+C, ½ Ch. F+C and ½ Ch. F+C+D, with three replicates was designed. After two years of giving treatments, it was found that adding full rate of chemical fertilizer based on soil test together with compost or dolomite increased the tree girth increment from the first year to the second year. Rubber yield after <b>soil</b> <b>improvements</b> tended to increase from the beginning {{to the end of the}} year, especially with compost application. Increasing of soil fertility was found after <b>soil</b> <b>improvement</b> treatments. However, total N, available P and available K were still lower than optimum levels as well as leaf N and K. Nitrogen in rubber latex after <b>soil</b> <b>improvement</b> treatments was higher than those in the control treatment, which contrasted to those of Ca and Mg. However, fertilizer and dolomite effect on micronutrient elements in rubber leaf and latex were not clear. Thus, fertilizer should be continuously applied at least with the full rate of chemical fertilizer based on soil analysis, and organic fertilizer should be applied to gain some trace elements. Dolomite could also be applied in a very strong acid soil...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The seismic {{performance}} of port structures {{has been well}} documented following recent earthquakes, and indicates that port structures are highly susceptible to earthquake-induced damages. These damages are primarily due to soil liquefaction and the associated ground failures. Sheet pile bulkheads provide vital intermodal and lifeline transportation links between water-side and land-side traffic, and are waterfront structures particularly vulnerable to liquefaction-induced damages. Due to the prevalence of liquefaction-induced damages, many ports are utilizing <b>soil</b> <b>improvement</b> techniques to mitigate these hazards. Many port authorities have proposed utilizing performance-based design criteria to limit potential earthquake-induced damages. The current design method for sheet pile walls (Mononobe-Okabe) is based on simple, limit equilibrium analysis techniques, which are poorly suited for performance-based design. Recent advancements in the seismic design of sheet pile walls have addressed some of the limitations of the current design methods, but are still inadequate for performing a complete, performance-based design for locations that contain potentially liquefiable soils and/or where <b>soil</b> <b>improvement</b> strategies have been instituted. This study has focused on conducting an empirical investigation and numerical modeling to determine the seismic {{performance of}} sheet pile walls, and the performancebased benefit of <b>soil</b> <b>improvement</b> through densification. A case history validated, nonlinear effective stress computer program was used to perform numerical parametric studies on various design parameters (earthquake properties, depth of sheet pile embedment, sheet pile wall stiffness, tie rod length, density of the backfill, and extent of soil densification). The results have been presented as a performance-based design method, and include a design chart that provides practitioners with a preliminary design tool that may be used to estimate the seismic deformations of sheet pile walls with or without <b>soil</b> <b>improvement.</b> The study has demonstrated that soil densification can greatly reduce the seismicallyinduced deformations, especially when the magnitude of <b>soil</b> <b>improvement</b> extends beyond the location of the anchor. The study has also demonstrated that the use of soil densification techniques for mitigating seismic hazards may not be adequate in limiting deformations to allowable limits, and that other methods of <b>soil</b> <b>improvement</b> (cementation, drainage, etc.) or structural improvements may also be required...|$|R
