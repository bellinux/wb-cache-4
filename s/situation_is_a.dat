25|$|According to Friedkin in a July 2012 interview, Universal and Paramount both {{claimed that}} they did not own the film and were not aware who did.

500|$|During the 1860s, {{steam engines}} {{improved}} with {{the adoption of}} double-expansion steam engines, which used 30–40% less coal than earlier models. The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double-expansion engine in 1871, and by 1875 they were widespread. [...] However, this development alone {{was not enough to}} herald the end of the mast. [...] Whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails, or was a rational response to the operational and strategic <b>situation,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> matter of debate. A steam-only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide, which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands. Just as significantly, because of unsolved problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines, the performance of double-expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory.|$|E
500|$|A case of {{the latter}} <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> species of cleaner fish and its mimic, though in this example the model is greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their body to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes that then let it clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean—and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's [...] "dance". Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off a piece of its fin before fleeing. Fish grazed on in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, so both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E

2500|$|Georgescu {{explains}} that modern mechanised agriculture has developed historically {{as a result}} of the growing pressure of population on arable land; but the relief of this pressure by means of mechanisation has only substituted a scarcer source of input for the more abundant input of solar radiation: Machinery, chemical fertilisers and pesticides all rely on mineral resources for their operation, rendering modern agriculture — and the industrialised food processing and distribution systems associated with it — almost as dependent on Earth's mineral stock as the industrial sector has always been. Georgescu cautions that this <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> major reason why the carrying capacity of Earth is decreasing. [...] In effect, overpopulation on Earth is largely a dynamic long run phenomenon, being a by-product of ever more constraining mineral scarcities.|$|E

2500|$|Although the country's {{economy has}} {{developed}} significantly since it achieved political stability in 2002, mainly {{thanks to the}} fast-rising earnings of the oil sector, Angola faces huge social and economic problems. These are in part {{a result of the}} almost continual state of conflict from 1961 onwards, although the highest level of destruction and socio-economic damage took place after the 1975 independence, during the long years of civil war. However, high poverty rates and blatant social inequality are chiefly the outcome of a combination of a persistent political authoritarianism, of [...] "neo-patrimonial" [...] practices {{at all levels of the}} political, administrative, armed forces and economic apparatuses, and of a pervasive corruption. The main beneficiary of this <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> social segment constituted during the last decades, around the political, administrative, economic and military power holders, which has accumulated (and continues accumulating) enormous wealth. [...] "Secondary beneficiaries" [...] are the middle strata which are about to become social classes.

2500|$|From the {{opposite}} angle, Romanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, {{has argued that}} Malthus was too optimistic, as he failed to recognize any upper limit {{to the growth of}} population — only, the geometric increase in human numbers is occasionally slowed down (checked) by the arithmetic increase in agricultural produce, according to Malthus' simple growth model; but some upper limit to population is bound to exist, as the total amount of agricultural land — actual as well as potential — on Earth is finite, Georgescu-Roegen points out. Georgescu-Roegen further argues that the industrialised world's increase in agricultural productivity since Malthus' day has been brought about by a mechanisation that has substituted a scarcer source of input for the more abundant input of solar radiation: Machinery, chemical fertilisers and pesticides all rely on mineral resources for their operation, rendering modern agriculture — and the industrialised food processing and distribution systems associated with it — almost as dependent on Earth's mineral stock as the industrial sector has always been. Georgescu-Roegen cautions that this <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> major reason why the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use. Political advisor Jeremy Rifkin and ecological economist Herman Daly, two students of Georgescu-Roegen, have raised similar neo-Malthusian concerns about the long run drawbacks of modern mechanised agriculture.|$|E
