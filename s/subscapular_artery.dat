40|$|Variations in the {{branching}} {{pattern of the}} axillary artery have paramount importance among anatomists, surgeons and radiologists. A study was conducted on this topic in Kolkata, among the people of West Bengal, a state of India. The upper limbs of 70 cadavers were dissected bilat-erally at the Department of Anatomy, Calcutta National Medical College, Kolkata, between 2008 and 2011. Among the study population, 52 cadavers (74. 3 %) were male and the rest were female, with average age 62. 01 years (standard deviation = 6. 58) and average height 1. 59 meter (standard deviation = 0. 096) respectively.

40|$|SUMMARY: This report {{presents}} double axillary {{and double}} brachial arteries {{on the right}} side of an adult male cadaver. In this case, the right axillary artery bifurcated into axillary artery I and axillary artery II posterior to the pectoralis minor muscle. Both the axillary arteries with their branches traversed upto lower border of teres major muscle and continued further as seperate entities into the cubital fossa as brachial artery I and brachial artery II respectively. The axillary artery I which continued as brachial artery I was super-ficial and tortuous in its course, while the axillary artery II was slender and deeply situated. The thoraco-acromial, lateral thoracic and <b>subscapular</b> <b>arteries</b> took origin from axillary artery I. The superior thoracic artery was seen arising from the thoraco-acromial artery. The anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries arose from axillary artery II. The profunda brachii artery was given off by the brachial artery II, while at the level of intercondylar line, the ulnar artery was given off by brachial artery I. In the cubital fossa, the brachial artery it divided into radial and common interosseous artery, while the brachial artery II ended by anastomosis with brachial artery I. The ulnar, radial and common interosseous arteries continued as separate entities and exhibited a normal course and distribution in the forearm. The hypothesis for the embryological basis of persistence of double axillary and double brachical arteries may be useful for experimental embryology. The knowledge of such multiple arterial variations as in the present case is of immense significance during Doppler scanning of blood vessels for clinical diagnosis and surgical management of diseases of superior extremity.

In a porcine experimental model, we investigated the transplantation-induced {{changes in the}} haemodynamics of a Y-shaped combined arterial autograft bypass-muscle flap (AABF). MethodsAnatomy of AABF was identified in eight dissections in four porcine cadavers. In five animals, AABF served as a superficial femoral artery (SFA) defect replacement. Modelled, triggered pulsatile pressure (P) and flow (Q) waves delivered mean haemodynamics and PQ hysteresis loops before and after transplantation at days 0 and 10. ResultsAnatomically, AABF combined <b>subscapular</b> and circumflex-scapular <b>arteries,</b> and thoracodorsal artery as latissimus dorsi flap pedicle. Surgical feasibility and AABF patency were confirmed in each case. At day 0, the proximal flow was increased in the grafted Y-shaped AABF, which also adopted the specific SFA pulsatile haemodynamics. Regulatory mechanisms of AABF vasomotricity were preserved and AABF-flow-dependence amplified the flow in the distal segment, which otherwise preserved its own flow dependence. At 10 days, the AABF flow was unchanged in the distal segment, and remained elevated in the proximal and pedicle segments. ConclusionsCombined AABF, as a single one-piece arterial autograft, was shown highly adaptive to the receiving arteries. The transplantation-induced changes in AABF pulsatile flow profile and vascular reactivity improve the overall graft flow, and strongly advocate for beneficial effects on the blood propelling capacity of the grafted circulation...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Major {{ablative}} {{surgery in}} the head and neck region may create composite defects involving the oral mucosa, bone and the overlying facial skin. The large surface area and the three-dimensional nature of these defects pose a difficult reconstructive challenge requiring adequate bone and large, positionally versatile skin flaps. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From September 1993 to May 2000, 19 patients with through-and-through osteocutaneous defects of the mouth and face were reconstructed with composite <b>subscapular</b> <b>artery</b> system flaps. The evaluated parameters included: (i) site and dimensions of the tissue defect; (ii) specific flap properties; and (iii) review of the recipient and donor site morbidity. RESULTS: 10 variants of scapular osteocutaneous flaps, eight latissimus dorsi with serratus anterior and rib osteo-myocutaneous flaps, and one combination of an osteocutaneous scapular and myocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap were used to reconstruct composite facial defects with mean dimensions of: skin 54. 4 cm(2), mucosa 56. 2 cm(2) and bone of 8. 2 cm. Ischaemic complications occurred in three patients including one total flap failure and one failure of the bony component in previously irradiated patients. The third flap was successfully salvaged. No significant long-term donor site morbidity was noted. CONCLUSION: Composite flaps based on the <b>subscapular</b> <b>artery</b> system are a versatile reconstructive modality for large through-and-through defects of the mouth and face...|$|E

It was also noted that, the long thoracic nerve was passing between the two branches of lateral thoracic artery.

There are known vascular anatomical variations in the supply to the serratus anterior.

30|$|The radial nerve {{originates}} {{from the}} ventral rami of C 5 – T 1 and {{lies in the}} posterior cord of the brachial plexus with the axillary artery as its anterior relation. Within the axilla, it has three branches: sensory posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm and motor branch to the long and medial head of the triceps. It passes anterior to the subscapularis, latissimus dorsi and teres major. This is the first possible site of compression. An anomalous muscle, the accessory subscapularis-teres-latissimus is reported in literature to be another cause of compression of the radial nerve at this level [8]. Another potential cause of compression, as described by Spinner [9] is penetration of the nerve directly by the <b>subscapular</b> <b>artery</b> more distally in the axilla, forming a neural loop.|$|E

30|$|Most {{cases of}} SAPVF are un{{associated}} with any symptoms, while SAPVF associated with severe hemoptysis, dyspnea due to cardiac failure, pulmonary hypertension, endocarditis, and chronic chest pain has occasionally been reported [8, 9]. In the past, {{the presence of}} a thoracic murmur or dyspnea provided clues to the diagnosis of SAPVF [3, 4], but recently, SAPVF has often been detected on the basis of abnormal findings such as increased lung vascularization or parenchymal infiltration on routinely obtained chest X-ray films or CT scans [5, 7]. The differential diagnoses include intrapulmonary AVM or pulmonary sequestration. However, these vascular abnormalities can be distinguished by angiography. The most common aberrant arteries in SAPVF are the internal thoracic arteries. The intercostal, axillary, diaphragmatic, and subclavian arteries can also be involved. In our patient, the intercostal artery, internal thoracic artery, lateral thoracic artery, and <b>subscapular</b> <b>artery</b> arising from the axillary artery drained into both the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein in the lingular segment of the left lung.|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesMajor tissue loss {{caused by}} the {{critical}} limb ischemia requires improvement of distal perfusion and cover of large tissue defects. We propose a new method, the y-shaped <b>subscapular</b> <b>artery</b> flow-through (Y-SCAFT) muscle flap using the <b>subscapular</b> <b>artery</b> that yields an arterial graft and a free muscle flap sustained by a collateral branch of this artery. This prospective study evaluated the feasibility of this technique and analyzed wound healing, graft patency, and limb salvage. MethodsBetween 2002 and 2007, 20 patients, mean age 64 years (range, 55 - 79 years), were treated with this technique. All presented with critical ischemia and major tissue loss, with exposure of the tendons, bones, or joint, and were candidates for major amputation. Revascularization and cover of tissue loss with the same Y-SCAFT anatomic unit was used for all patients. The distal anastomosis was performed between the distal branch of the Y-SCAFT and the pedal artery in 9, posterior tibial artery in 4, peroneal artery in 1, lateral tarsal artery in 3, and the plantar artery in 3. In four patients, the distal part of the arterial graft, including the anastomosis, was covered with the muscle flap because the tissue loss was nearby. The proximal anastomosis was performed between a leg artery and the arterial graft in 10 patients. A venous graft was necessary in 10 patients to extend the bypass proximally. ResultsOne patient died during the postoperative period. Duplex control evidenced patency all the Y-SCAFT muscle flaps. Healing was achieved in all patients. Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 6 - 58 months). No patients died during follow-up. One patient presented occlusion of the Y-SCAFT muscle flap and underwent amputated. One patient had major amputation despite a patent graft. At 2 years, leg salvage was 85 %, patency was 94 %, and survival was 94 %. At {{the end of the}} follow-up, 17 patients (1 death, 2 amputations) had a patent graft, a viable muscle flap, wound healing, and a functional leg. ConclusionWe showed the clinical feasibility of the technique of Y-SCAFT muscle flap, which allows for revascularization and cover of major tissue loss with one anatomic unit. This method is particularly useful in selected cases with poor run-off and large ischemic lesions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Axillary artery {{injury in}} the {{shoulder}} region following blunt trauma without association with either shoulder dislocation or fracture of the humeral neck has been previously reported. Axillary artery injury might also be accompanied with brachial plexus injury. However, delayed onset of brachial plexus palsy caused by a compressive hematoma associated with axillary injury after blunt trauma in the shoulder region has been rarely reported. In previous reports, this condition only occurred in old patients with sclerotic vessels. We present {{a case of a}} young patient who suffered axillary artery injury associated with brachial plexus palsy that occurred tardily due to compressive hematoma after blunt trauma in the shoulder region without association of either shoulder dislocation or humeral neck fracture. Case presentation A 16 -year-old male injured his right shoulder in a motorbike accident. On initial physical evaluation, the pulses on the radial and ulnar arteries in the affected arm were palpable. Paralysis developed later from 2 days after the injury. Functions in the right arm became significantly impaired. Angiography showed complete occlusion of the axillary artery. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass measuring 4 × 5 cm that was suspected to be a hematoma compressing the brachial plexus in a space between the subscapular muscle and the pectoralis minor muscle. Surgery was performed on the third day after injury. In intraoperative observations, the axillary artery was occluded with thrombus along 5 cm; a <b>subscapular</b> <b>artery</b> was ruptured; the brachial plexus was compressed by the hematoma. After evacuation of the hematoma, neurolysis of the brachial plexus, and revascularization of the axillary artery, the patient had an excellent functional recovery of the affected upper limb, postoperatively. Conclusion Surgeons should be aware that axillary artery injuries may even occur in young people after severe blunt trauma in the shoulder region and can be associated with secondary brachial plexus injury due to a hematoma. For treatment in cases with progressive nervous deficit after trauma, not only reconstruction of the injured artery but also immediate evacuation of the hematoma, and exploration of the brachial plexus are necessary to avoid irreversible neurological damage. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine whether autogenous arterial grafts to distal pedal arteries improve the patency of grafts and limb salvage in patients with end-stage renal disease and nonhealing ischemic wounds and to better define the indications for autogenous arterial grafts. Design: A review of consecutive patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing autogenous arterial grafts from 1994 through 1999 was carried out. The setting was a university hospital. All 11 patients with end-stage renal disease and nonhealing, ischemic wounds (stage IV SVS-ISCVS classification) undergoing autogenous arterial grafting from 1994 to 1999 were evaluated. Noninvasive studies confirmed inadequate perfusion pressures in all patients. Pre-bypass arteriography identified no major arteries patent {{at the level of the}} malleolus, with reconstitution of only a distal or branch pedal or plantar vessel less than 1 mm in diameter. Five patients with patent tibial vessels to just above the ankle underwent bypass surgery with autogenous arterial grafts alone. Six patients also had proximal occlusive disease that required grafts longer than the autogenous arterial grafts; in each of these six patients, an autogenous vein graft proximal to the autogenous arterial graft was placed through use of a composite technique. Inflow was from the common femoral artery in one patient, the popliteal artery in five patients, and a tibial artery in five patients. Outflow was to the medial plantar artery in five patients, the distal dorsalis pedis artery in three patients, the lateral plantar artery in two patients, and the superficial arch in one patient. The conduit was the <b>subscapular</b> <b>artery</b> in four patients, the deep inferior epigastric artery in four patients, the superficial inferior epigastric artery in two patients, and the radial artery in one patient. The main outcome measures were assisted primary graft patency and functional limb salvage rate. Results: Follow-up ranged from 6 to 63 months (mean, 20 months); graft patency was determined by means of duplex scanning. All 11 patients are alive, and nine grafts are patent, including three after revision for graft stenosis. Assisted primary patency was 82 % at 3 years. All nine patients with patent grafts remained ambulatory and had healed wounds or limited forefoot amputations. Conclusion: Autogenous arterial grafts were effective in treating limb-threatening ischemia in patients with end-stage renal disease and inframalleolar arterial insufficiency. Graft patency and limb salvage rates were higher than those reported for autogenous vein graft in these patients. Autogenous arterial grafting may therefore prove to be an effective alternative to autogenous vein grafting in selected patients. (J Vasc Surg 2000; 32 : 13 - 22. ...|$|E
