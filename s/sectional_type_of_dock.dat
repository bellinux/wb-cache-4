5000|$|In {{the draft}} horse and some harness breeds the tail is cut very short {{to keep it}} from being tangled in a harness. The term [...] "docked" [...] or [...] "docking" [...] may simply mean cutting the hair of the tail skirt very short, just past the end <b>of</b> the natural <b>dock</b> <b>of</b> the tail. However, it can also refer to partial tail amputation. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>docking</b> is banned in some places, and either <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>docking</b> can make it {{difficult}} for a horse to effectively swat flies. Another controversial practice, tail setting, involves placing the <b>dock</b> <b>of</b> the tail in a device that causes it to be carried at all times in an arched position desired for show. The set is used when the horses are stalled, and removed during performances. It stretches the muscles to keep the tail in position, and is not used after the horse is retired from competition. Sometimes the process is sped up by the controversial practice of nicking or cutting the check ligament that normally pulls the tail downward. This practice is generally only used for a few breeds, such as the American Saddlebred.|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports the}} results of a {{comparison}} of the histochemical properties <b>of</b> various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> porcine muscles in wild and domestic pigs. In domestic pigs, the influence of growth rates on these properties were studied in five muscles: longissimus dorsi (LD), semimembranosus (SM), gluteus superficialis (GS), infra spinam (IS) and masseter (MAS). The growth rate was expressed as (i) live weight (LW) at 165 ± 2 d and (ii) daily LW gain from day 88 to day 165 (DG) on the experimental diet. LD, SM, GS and IS of wild pigs were found to contain a higher area percentage <b>of</b> oxidative <b>type</b> IIA fibres (type IIA%area) and a lower percentage area <b>of</b> glycolytic <b>type</b> IIB fibres (type IIB%area) than the same muscles of domestic pigs. The capillary density in the light muscles (LD, SM, GS) of wild pigs was twice that of domestic pigs, indicating higher oxidative capacity. In domestic pigs the cross <b>sectional</b> area <b>of</b> <b>type</b> IIB fibres (CSAIIB) was markedly larger than the cross <b>sectional</b> area <b>of</b> <b>type</b> I (CSAI) and IIA (CSAIIA) fibres. The average fibre cross sectional area (CSAfibre) was about the same in the muscles of wild and domestic pigs except in LD and SM, where the average fibre cross sectional area was approximately 25 % smaller in wild pigs than in domestic pigs. This difference was caused by the large cross <b>sectional</b> area <b>of</b> <b>type</b> IIB fibres in the light muscles of domestic pigs.

40|$|The problem studied is {{feedback}} for docking {{a mobile}} robot or AGV, to a pallet. The pallet is of known size {{but with an}} essentially unknown load. The pallet has an initial uncertainty in pose (position and orientation) of the order ± 15 cm and ± 20 degrees. The docking error is required to be within ± 1 cm and ± 1 degree with “very low” failure rate. For the <b>docking</b> a combination <b>of</b> a range camera and a video camera is used. In the paper the range camera is emphasized. Experimental results from this work in progress are presented. Successful docking has been made with typical ± 5 mm as errors. Currently one weak part is the integration with the control system on board the robot. Our persistent experience from this and earlier tests is that the weak part when using non-contact sensing for feedback in robots is the association problem.

40|$|Abstract: Alongshore pile wharf {{is widely}} used in most docks in China, but there occurs serious {{deposition}} when the wharf is built in the leading edge <b>of</b> the <b>dock.</b> Based on the analysis of field data, physical model results, and numerical simulation for the open-type piled wharf of the Waigaoqiao Port in the Yangtze Estuary, the characteristic of deposition {{and the reasons for}} serious siltation in {{the leading edge of the}} wharf in recent years are studied in this paper. The results show that the weak current near the dock, induced by the resistance of piles on flow, is one of the important reasons, and the deflecting effect of piles on current is another one. Besides, the increase of bank slope in the back of the wharf after its construction speeds up the beach moving forward, enhancing the siltation in this area too. For this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>dock,</b> owing to the dredging of harbor basin is executed on the beach slope, the process of sediment siltation is very complex, and the deposition of suspended sediment is only one part of it. The collapse of slope resulted from the breaking of equilibrium beach profile is the primary reason for the serious deposition in the leading edge of wharf after it is dredged. Based on analysis of the features of sediment deposition for the alongshore open-type wharf and the silting verification, a model for silting calculation is discussed and used to estimate sediment siltation in front <b>of</b> the <b>dock</b> edge after harbor basin dredged.

Age and sex {{have to be taken}} into account to the best to predict height from arm span. It is useful in predicting age related loss in stature and in identifying individuals with disproportionate growth abnormalities and skeletal dysplasia. Objective The present study was under taken to measure the stature as well as arm span and to determine whether there is any correlation between the stature and the arm span Method This cross <b>sectional</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> descriptive study was carried out with a total number of 400 Nepalese adult population consisting of 225 Nepalese male adults and 175 female adults aged between 25 to 45 years. Stature and arm span were measured directly from the subjects by using anthropometric technique by a measuring tape. The data taken were statistically analyzed by computation to find out its normative value. The relationship between body height and arm span were determined using simple correlation coefficients. Then a linear regression analysis was performed to examine the extent to which arm span can readily predict body height Results The results have shown male of Birgunj are 167. 39 ± 6. 170 cm tall and have arm span of 168. 01 ± 7. 659 cm, while female of Birgunj are 155. 61 ± 6. 894 cm and have arm span of 159. 25 ± 6 [...] 362 cm. The results obtained are substantially alike in other populations, since arm span was too close to body heights in male and greater in female.

40|$|Background: By {{the dawn}} of this modern era of science, the prime {{challenge}} of physician is cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The most important modifiable risk factors of CVDs are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use. The effects of unhealthy diet and physical inactivity include abnormal blood lipid and obesity. We tried to evaluate the lipid profile and obesity among the employees of Bangladesh Secretariat. Methods: This cross <b>sectional</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> descriptive study was carried out among 1000 employees of Bangladesh Secretariat in December, 2008. All classes of employees irrespective of age or sex were included. Body mass index (BMI) and fasting lipid profile were measured in each case. Sociodemographic variables and different related risk factors were also evaluated. Result: Out of 1000 employees with a male, female ratio of 4. 75 : 1, 65 % had sedentary life style. 20. 6 % were smoker and only 0. 05 % {{had a history of}} taking alcohol regularly. 10. 1 % had a history of hyperlipidemia in first degree relatives. Only 2. 1 % were known cases of hyperlipidemia. BMI of 47 % employees were in normal range with a mean 24. 38 ± 3. 14 SD. Mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglyceride (TG) level was found 170. 65 ± 39. 37, 103. 72 ± 30. 9, 36. 45 ± 5. 93 and 169 ± 97. 69 SD respectively.

30|$|Molecular docking is {{a method}} that predicts {{preferred}} orientation of a compound bound to a second during {{the formation of a}} stable complex and finds its frequent application in in silico pharmaceutical design. Current methods <b>of</b> <b>docking</b> include pose prediction, using docking algorithms and energy-based scoring functions that identify the optimal binding modes of a drug, i.e. energetically most favorable conformations, to the active sites of a target protein. Lower free energy means better ligand–protein binding (Thomsen and Christensen 2006; Gschwend et al. 1996; Kroemer 2007). Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>docking</b> algorithms are most common: flexible and rigid. In flexible docking, either {{one or both of the}} molecules involved in binding are considered as flexible objects, whereas rigid docking imposes conformational restriction on both the ligand and protein, thereby considering them as rigid solid objects (Zhou et al. 2007; Halperin et al. 2002). In the current work, both flexible and rigid <b>docking</b> for each <b>of</b> the ligand–protein entities were performed using Autodock Vina (Trott and Olson 2010). TORSDOF was set for all the ligands followed by the conversion of all rotatable bonds into non-rotatable during rigid docking. While performing flexible docking, ligand molecules were kept flexible and the protein was kept rigid. The grid boxes were constructed in such a manner that it covered the colored volumes corresponding to the binding pockets identified in Additional file 1 : Figure S 1. For both flexible and rigid <b>docking,</b> the dimensions <b>of</b> grid boxes were chosen as follows: 54.6895, 43.2718 and 54.3972  Å towards X, Y and Z co-ordinates respectively.

40|$|Container vessel motions need to {{be small}} when loading and {{offloading}} cargo while moored to wharfs. Waves and their reflections from structures can induce ship motions. These motions are characterized by {{six degrees of freedom}}, including translations of surge, sway, and heave and rotations of pitch, roll, and yaw. Monitoring and quantifying these motions offer a reference for design and selection of the mooring system and wharf types. To measure the six degrees of freedom motions of a container ship moored to a dock, a 1 : 50 scale model is moored to two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>dock,</b> solid wall dock and pile supported <b>dock.</b> Irregular waves <b>of</b> TMA spectrum with various periods, heights, and directions are generated in the wave basin to induce the motions of the model container ship. Optical motion capturing cameras are used to measure and quantify the six degree of freedom motions. Results of the effects of wave period, significant wave height, and wave direction on the motion characteristics of the model container ship moored at the solid dock and a pile supported dock are described in detail. A numerical simulation called aNySIM is applied to numerically predict the motion characteristics of the container ship moored to a solid wall dock only. The physical model experimental results <b>of</b> solid <b>dock</b> are also compared with the numerical simulation. These comparisons indicate that the motion characteristics of the model container ship represent similar trends for both rotations and translations. The experimental and numerical prediction values of motions of the ship moored to a solid wall dock display the same tendencies while differing in magnitude...|$|R
2500|$|From 1960 to 1980, {{trade in}} the docks {{declined}} to almost [...] nothing. There were two main reasons. First, {{the development of the}} shipping container made this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> relatively small <b>dock</b> inefficient, and the dock-owners were slow to embrace change. Second, the manufacturing exports which had maintained the trade through the docks dwindled and moved away from the local area. In 1980 the docks were closed and the Government took control of the land.|$|R

Equipment docks are trading stations which are aimed at the distribution of ship upgrades and equipment. They trade in missiles, lasers, shields, software and upgrades.

The incidence of gallbladder illness {{in our country}} increasing day by day. Details morphological and histomorphological knowledge is essential for proper diagnosis & management of the gallbladder diseases. This is a cross <b>sectional</b> descriptive <b>type</b> <b>of</b> study which {{was carried out in}} the Department of Anatomy, Sir Salimullah Medical College, Dhaka from July 2010 to June 2011. The number of sample was 62 postmortem human gallbladder which were collected from unclaimed dead bodies of the morgue of Dhaka Medical College and Sir Salimullah Medical College. The samples were divided into three different age groups. Morphological study was carried out on all samples by fine dissection method and histomorphological study was carried out on 18 relatively fresh samples by light microscopic method. There was statistically significant difference found when values were compared between different age groups. This study has revealed an age related change in the thickness of the gallbladder wall...|$|R
