5|$|The Iazyges {{became one}} of the many new client-tribes of Rome during the reign of Tiberius. Roman client states were treated {{according}} to the Roman tradition of patronship, exchanging rewards for service. However, during this time, the Iazyges still conducted raids across their border with Rome, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> did in 6AD and again in 16AD. In 20AD the Iazyges moved west along the Carpathians into the Pannonian Steppe, and settled in the steppes between the Danube and the Tisza river, taking absolute control of it from the Dacians. In 50AD, an Iazyges cavalry detachment fought alongside the Suevian King Vannius, a Roman client king of the Quadi.|$|E
5|$|From the 1830s to the interwar period (1919–1939), the Anglo-Norman {{was one of}} {{the main}} horses used by the French cavalry. Although author Alfred Gallier stated that it was a good breed for this use, many {{opposing}} scholars argued that this was not the case. Military requirements conflicted with Norman breeders, as the carriage horses preferred by the breeders were very different from the style sought by the military, which required fast horses with stamina and agility. According to military equestrian Denis Bogros, the economic weight of the Norman horse breeders was <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> negatively influenced the effectiveness of the French army until the early 20th century, producing only large, overweight trotters that became fatigued more easily than Barbs or Arabians. Bogros states that breeders of Norman horses managed to deceive the French government, through powerful lobbying groups, by selling the military rejects from the breeding programs. The Anglo-Norman was a commercial success as carriage horses, but proved worthless for the cavalry. This led to the creation of the Société du cheval de guerre (Society of the War Horse), which in 1906 severely criticized the use of the Anglo-Norman. Bogros considered the Anglo-Arabians bred near Tarbes to be much more useful for the military.|$|E

25|$|Once the {{operation}} began, Townshend was left essentially without a job. The only un-engaged infantry units {{were the two}} battalions of the 30th Brigade holding the Ottoman forces on the right bank in place with a feint. His cavalry was trying to position itself along the anticipated retreat routes along the Tigris. The only units still under his control, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were, was the RN/RIM flotilla.

Nonetheless, one can infer from the intelligible parts that the god Phoebus Apollo is being invoked {{in order to raise}} his arms against someone or something, probably to the advantage of the amulet owner. The wording does not correspond to any other ancient epigraphic and literary texts, providing further evidence that the gold foil is genuine and not a modern forgery.|$|E

However, taken in bulk, the wartime films are decidedly substandard. No Dough Boys (again 1944) is often considered {{the best of these}} farces. The team, made up as Japanese soldiers for a photo shoot, is mistaken for genuine saboteurs by a Nazi ringleader (Vernon Dent, the Stooges' primary foil). The highlight of the film features the Stooges engaging in nonsensical gymnastics (the real spies are renowned acrobats) for a skeptical group of enemy agents.|$|E
25|$|When Ewell's corps did attack these {{positions}} on July 2 and July 3, the Union had {{had time to}} fully occupy the heights and build impregnable defenses, resulting in heavy Confederate losses. Postwar proponents of the lost cause movement, particularly Jubal Early, but also Maj. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble, who {{had been assigned to}} Ewell's staff during the battle, criticized him bitterly in attempts to deflect any blame for the loss of the battle on Robert E. Lee. Part of their argument was that the Union troops were completely demoralized by their defeat earlier in the day, but Ewell's men were also disorganized, and decisions <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were propounding are far simpler to make in hindsight than in the heat of battle and fog of war.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate {{authorities}} had long {{believed that the}} Navy's ironclad ships, particularly CSS Louisiana, would render the river impregnable against assaults <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were now experiencing. Although Louisiana was not yet finished, Generals Lovell and Duncan pressed Commodore Whittle to hurry the preparation. Acceding to their wishes against his better judgment, Whittle had the ship launched prematurely and added to Commander Mitchell's fleet even while workmen were still fitting her out. On {{the second day of}} the bombardment, she was towed (too late, her owners found that her engines were not strong enough to enable her to buck the current) to a position on the left bank, upstream from Fort St. Philip, where she became in effect a floating battery. Mitchell would not move her closer because her armor would not protect her from the plunging shot of Porter's mortars. However, because her guns could not be elevated, they could not be brought to bear on the enemy so long as they remained below the forts.|$|E

At the same time, urban industrial life was full of benefits, though these could be just as dangerous, {{from the point of view}} of social and political stability, as the hardships. There were many encouragements to expect more from life. Acquiring new skills gave many workers a sense of self-respect and confidence, heightening expectations and desires.

They are all to be at Head Quarters to morrow precisely at twelve, at noon, when the Number wanted will be fixed upon.

25|$|During this time, the Anglican Church assumed {{de facto}} {{administrative}} {{responsibility in the}} far-flung wilderness of Canada and British North America. The church contracted with colonial officials and later the federal Crown to administer residential schools for the indigenous peoples of the First Nations – a decision which {{would come back to}} haunt it much later. Such schools removed children from their home communities in an attempt to, among other things, assimilate them into the dominant European culture and language: the merits and demerits of that system in a broad sense, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were, have latterly been entirely overwhelmed by the issue of the wholly reprehensible abuse of some of its child wards by sexually disordered mission personnel. At the same time, Anglican missionaries were involved in advocating for First Nations rights and land claims on behalf of those people to whom they were ministering (for example, the Nisga'a of northern British Columbia). One of the earliest First Nations students to be educated at Red River in the 1830s was Henry Budd. He was ordained in 1850 and was the first First Nations priest and became the missionary at Fort Cumberland on the Saskatchewan River and then to the post of The Pas. The Anglican Church of Canada's Prayer Book commemorates Henry Budd on 2 April.|$|E

500|$|Most {{often the}} {{privilege}} was applied {{in cases of}} imprisonment in debtors' prisons. In 1870, both imprisonment for debt and the privilege in relation to freedom from arrest for bankruptcy were abolished, {{and as a result}} the freedom became extremely limited in practical application. Now, civil proceedings involve arrests only when an individual disobeys a court order. Since 1945, the privilege of freedom from arrest in civil cases has arisen in only two cases: Stourton v Stourton (1963) and Peden International Transport, Moss Bros, The Rowe Veterinary Group and Barclays Bank plc v Lord Mancroft (1989). In the latter most recent case, the trial judge considered the privilege obsolete and inapplicable, and said in proceedings, [...] "the privilege did not apply—indeed... it is unthinkable in modern times that, in circumstances <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are in this case, it should".|$|E
500|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} also be {{formulated}} as the problem of locating one or more points such that the differences of its distances to three given points equal three known values. Consider a solution circle of radius r's and three given circles of radii r1, r2 and r3. If the solution circle is externally tangent to all three given circles, the distances between {{the center of the}} solution circle and the centers of the given circles equal , [...] and , respectively. Therefore, differences in these distances are constants, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> depend only on the known radii of the given circles and not on the radius r's of the solution circle, which cancels out. This second formulation of Apollonius' problem can be generalized to internally tangent solution circles (for which the center-center distance equals the difference of radii), by changing the corresponding differences of distances to sums of distances, so that the solution-circle radius r's again cancels out. The re-formulation in terms of center-center distances is useful in the solutions below of Adriaan van Roomen and Isaac Newton, and also in hyperbolic positioning or trilateration, which is the task of locating a position from differences in distances to three known points. For example, navigation systems such as LORAN identify a receiver's position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three fixed positions, which correspond to the differences in distances to those transmitters.|$|E

500|$|That {{indemnification}} was {{an important}} sideshow in the negotiations. The consequence of the Peace Treaty was that the Batavian Republic now received international recognition, even by the British government, and that the old Dutch Republic was now irreversibly dead. This {{put an end to}} all pretensions of the Stadtholder and his heirs, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were. It may be important to note that these pretensions were dubious to begin with. The Stadtholder was never the sovereign power in the Netherlands, despite understandable misconceptions by foreigners, who may have thought that a country needed a head of state, and the Stadtholder was it. Instead he was an officeholder, appointed by the provincial States, who also was captain-general and admiral-general of the Union (there was originally no stadtholder on the confederal level). In the Orangist revolution of 1747 this office had been revamped to [...] "Stadhouder-generaal" [...] and made hereditary, and after the Prussian intervention of 1787 the powers of the Stadtholder had become dictatorial. But formally the States-General had been sovereign since 1588, and the Stadtholder was merely their [...] "first servant." [...] The British may have entertained certain fantasies about his formal status, when it suited their purposes. An example would be the Kew Letters he was persuaded to write to the governors of the Dutch colonies in his capacity of captain-general on 7 February 1795, ordering them to immediately surrender those colonies to the British [...] "for preservation." [...] Another example would be their acceptance of the surrender of the Batavian fleet {{in the name of the}} Stadtholder in 1799, as though he was a sovereign prince. But this was all make-believe, and it ended with this Peace (though it was conveniently revived in 1813).|$|E
