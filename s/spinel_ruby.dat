6000|$|Maria and Zo, at {{the sight}} of their mother, had taken flight. Carmina stood alone in the hall. Mrs. Gallilee had turned her cold. After awhile, she {{followed}} the children as far as her own room. There, her resolution failed her. She called faintly upstairs--"Frances!" [...] There was no answering voice. She went into her room. A small paper packet was on the table; sealed, and addressed to herself. She tore it open. A ring with a <b>spinel</b> <b>ruby</b> in it dropped out: she recognised the stone--it was Miss Minerva's ring.|$|E

50|$|Lục Yên is a rural {{district}} of Yên Bái Province, in the Northeast region of Vietnam. As of 2003 the district had {{a population of}} 100,785. The district covers an area of 811 km². The district capital lies at Yên Thế. Numerous quarries in the district produce gemstones such as <b>rubies,</b> <b>spinel,</b> and tourmaline.|$|R
5000|$|The {{transparent}} red spinels {{were called}} spinel-rubies or balas rubies. In the past, {{before the arrival}} of modern science, <b>spinels</b> and <b>rubies</b> were equally known as rubies. After the 18th century the word ruby was only used for the red gem variety of the mineral corundum and the word spinel came to be used. [...] "Balas" [...] is derived from Balascia, the ancient name for Badakhshan, a region in central Asia situated in the upper valley of the Panj River, one of the principal tributaries of the Oxus River. Mines in the Gorno Badakhshan region of Tajikistan constituted for centuries the main source for red and pink spinels.|$|R
50|$|Spinel {{has long}} {{been found in the}} gemstone-bearing gravel of Sri Lanka and in limestones of the Badakshan Province in modern-day Afghanistan and Tajikistan; and of Mogok in Burma. Recently gem quality spinels also found in the marbles of Luc Yen (Vietnam), Mahenge and Matombo (Tanzania), Tsavo (Kenya) and in the gravels of Tunduru (Tanzania) and Ilakaka (Madagascar). Spinel is found as a {{metamorphic}} mineral, and also as a primary mineral in rare mafic igneous rocks; in these igneous rocks, the magmas are relatively deficient in alkalis relative to aluminium, and aluminium oxide may form as the mineral corundum or may combine with magnesia to form spinel. This is why <b>spinel</b> and <b>ruby</b> are often found together.|$|R
50|$|In all, 33 ores and {{minerals}} are currently mined in the numerous quarries in Lục Yên District, {{out of which}} 23 are valid minerals, including gemstones. Among these ores {{and minerals}} are: apatite, biotite, calcite, chlorite group, chondrodite, corundum, danburite, elbaite, fluor-cannilloite, graphite, humite, lepidolite, varieties of microcline such as amazonite, muscovite, olivine, orthoclase, paragonite, pargasite, phlogopite, pyrite, quartz and smoky quartz, rossmanite, rutile, schorl, spinel, titanite and tourmaline; gemstones such as <b>rubies,</b> <b>spinel,</b> and tourmaline. Luc Yen is particularly famous for its rubies.|$|R
5000|$|The most recent, {{and least}} {{historically}} documented, identification of langgan {{is a red}} gemstone. The Chinese geologist Chang Hung-Chao (Zhang Hongzhao) propagated this explanation when his book about geological terms in Chinese literature identified langgan as malachite, and noted an alternative construal of reddish <b>spinel</b> or balas <b>ruby</b> from the famous mines at Badakhshan (1921: 26-27, 24). Some authors have cited Chang's balas ruby identification of langgan (e.g., Needham and Lu 1974: 180); others have used, or even confused, it with ruby, in translations (e.g., [...] "precious rubies" [...] Knoblock 1994: 44).|$|R

Sakura is suddenly unable {{to use the}} Clow Cards and transforms her wand, beginning the process of evolving the cards into Sakura Cards as Eriol causes strange occurrences that forces her to use and thus transform certain cards. Once all the cards have been transformed, Eriol tells Sakura that he aided her in converting the cards so they would not lose their magic powers. Syaoran later confesses his love to Sakura, who comes to realize she also loves him. Cardcaptor Sakura concludes with Syaoran returning to Hong Kong with a promise to return. Two years later, Syaoran moves back to Tomoeda permanently.|$|R
5000|$|The M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, which {{originally}} {{opened in}} 1895, is named in his honor. De Young {{helped develop the}} gem collection for what became California’s first museum in 1894. After visiting New York, in the capacity of Director-General of the San Francisco Midwinter Fair, which {{grew out of the}} California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894, de Young used a $200,000 surplus as a fund {{for the establishment of a}} memorial museum. He purchased many things of [...] "curious and artistic and instructive value". The collection of precious stones, which were made by George Frederick Kunz of Tiffany & Co. included diamonds, topazes, opals, red garnets, turquoises, emeralds, and arid rubies, as well as lesser known jewels including asteriated diamonds, alexandrites from Russia, <b>ruby</b> <b>spinels</b> from Burmah, beryls from the Ural Mountains, and Spessartines from Brazil.|$|R
