5|$|Turkeys {{are large}} birds, their nearest {{relatives}} being the pheasant and the guineafowl. Males {{are larger than}} females and have spreading, fan-shaped tails and distinctive, fleshy wattles, called a <b>snood,</b> that hang {{from the top of}} the beak and are used in courtship display. Wild turkeys can fly, but seldom do so, preferring to run with a long, stratling gait. They roost in trees and forage on the ground, feeding on seeds, nuts, berries, grass, foliage, invertebrates, lizards, and small snakes.|$|E
5|$|Phasianidae {{consists}} of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump with broad relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans. Turkeys have a distinctive fleshy wattle that hangs from {{the underside of the}} beak and a fleshy protuberance that hangs from the top of its beak called a <b>snood.</b> As with many galliform species, the female (the hen) is smaller and much less colorful than the male (the tom). With wingspans of , the turkeys are the largest birds in the open forests in which they live and are rarely mistaken for any other species. Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. In all of Maryland's species, males are polygamous and have elaborate courtship displays. These heavily built birds have legs feathered to the toes. Most species are year-round residents and do not migrate. Four species of Phasianidae have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E

With wingspans of 1.51.8 meters (almost 6 feet), the turkeys are the largest birds in the open forests in which they live and are rarely mistaken for any other species. Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are game and are sometimes hunted for food. In all North Carolinian species, males are polygamous and have elaborate courtship displays. These heavily built birds have legs feathered to the toes. Most species are year-round residents and do not migrate. Three species in this family have been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E

25|$|The great {{majority}} of domestic turkeys are bred to have white feathers because their pin feathers are less visible when the carcass is dressed, although brown or bronze-feathered varieties are also raised. The fleshy protuberance atop the beak is the <b>snood,</b> and the one attached to {{the underside of the}} beak is known as a wattle.|$|E
25|$|Jewish law {{requires}} married women {{to cover their}} hair; according to the Talmud, this is a biblical requirement, which {{in this context is}} called dat Moshe (the law of Moses). The most common hair coverings in the Haredi community are the sheitel (wig), the <b>snood,</b> and the mitpachat (Hebrew: scarf) or tichel (Yiddish), as well as hats and berets.|$|E

25|$|Hasidic {{women wear}} {{clothing}} {{adhering to the}} principles of modest dress in Jewish law. This includes long, conservative skirts and sleeves past the elbow, as well as covered necklines. Also, the women wear stockings to cover their legs; in some Hasidic groups, such as Satmar or Toldot Aharon, the stockings must be opaque. In keeping with Jewish law, married women cover their hair, using either a sheitel (wig), a tichel (headscarf), a shpitzel, a <b>snood,</b> a hat, or a beret. In some Hasidic groups, such as Satmar, women may wear two headcoverings – a wig and a scarf, or a wig and a hat.|$|E

50|$|In Orthodox Judaism, {{married women}} are {{required}} to cover their hair with scarves, known as tichels or <b>snoods,</b> {{in compliance with the}} code of modesty known as tzniut. These hair coverings come in different shapes and sizes. Tichel is a veil where it covers all the hair, and towards the back of the head, the left over veil is made into a bun. <b>Snoods</b> belong to almost the same style, and are worn more like a hat. An alternative is to cover the natural hair by wearing a wig or a beret.|$|R

2500|$|The barbet and fillet or barbet and veil {{could also}} be worn over the crespine, a thick hairnet or <b>snood.</b> [...] Over time, the crespine evolved into a mesh of jeweler's work that {{confined}} {{the hair on the}} sides of the head, and even later, at the back. [...] This metal crespine was also called a caul, and remained stylish long after the barbet had fallen out of fashion. For example, it was used in Hungary until the beginning of the second half of the 15th century, as it was used by the Hungarian queen consort Barbara of Celje around 1440.|$|E
2500|$|Maturing males spend a {{considerable}} proportion {{of their time}} sexually displaying. [...] This {{is very similar to}} that of the wild turkey and involves fanning the tail feathers, drooping the wings and erecting all body feathers, including the 'beard' (a tuft of black, modified hair-like feathers on the centre of the breast). The skin of the head, neck and caruncles (fleshy nodules) becomes bright blue and red, and the <b>snood</b> (an erectile appendage on the forehead) elongates, the birds 'sneeze' at regular intervals, followed by a rapid vibration of their tail feathers. Throughout, the birds strut slowly about, with the neck arched backward, their breasts thrust forward and emitting their characteristic 'gobbling' call.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} hats and headdresses were worn in Europe in the 15th century. The crespine of Northern Europe, {{originally}} a thick hairnet or <b>snood,</b> had {{evolved into a}} mesh of jeweler's work that confined {{the hair on the}} sides of the head by the end of the 14th century. [...] Gradually the fullness at the sides of head was pulled up to the temples and became pointed, like horns (à corné). By mid-15th century, the hair was pulled back from the forehead, and the crespine, now usually called a caul, sat on the back of the head. [...] Very fashionable women shaved their foreheads and eyebrows. Any of these styles could be topped by a padded roll, sometimes arranged in a heart-shape, or a veil, or both. Veils were supported by wire frames that exaggerated the shape and were variously draped from the back of the headdress or covered the forehead.|$|E
50|$|A {{caruncle}} {{is defined}} as 'a small, fleshy excrescence that is {{a normal part of}} an animal's anatomy'. Within this definition, caruncles in birds include wattles (or dewlaps), <b>snoods,</b> and earlobes. The term caruncle is derived from Latin 'caruncula', the diminutive of 'carō', flesh.|$|R

It was exchanged for the curch, toy, or coif, when she passed, by marriage, into the matron state. But if the damsel was so unfortunate as to lose pretensions to the name of maiden, without gaining a right to that of matron, she was neither permitted to use the <b>snood,</b> nor advanced to the graver dignity of the curch. In old Scottish songs there occur many sly allusions to such misfortune; as in the old words to the popular tune of 'Ower the muir amang the heather:' ...|$|E
