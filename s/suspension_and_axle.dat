5000|$|The TC's {{platform}} {{was based}} on a shortened Dodge Daytona chassis with <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> <b>axles</b> from the original model (except for the 5 speed Getrag with [...] "Maserati" [...] engine). The bodywork was produced by De Tomaso subsidiary Innocenti. The struts and shock absorbers were specially designed for the car by Fichtel and Sachs, and a Teves anti-lock braking system was standard. The special wheels were made in Italy by the Formula One supplier Fondmetal.|$|R
50|$|BMW, Ford, GMC, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Scania AB, Subaru and Volvo {{have each}} pursued {{numerous}} avenues {{to address this}} issue, including air <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> rear <b>axle</b> mechanical devices.|$|R
50|$|The engine, gearbox, <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> rear <b>axle</b> {{were based}} on the KC mechanicals.In addition, 4-wheel drive was added via a 2-speed {{transfer}} case.Water propulsion was by a PTO driven propeller.Brakes were hydraulic.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the chassis}} {{components}} {{were the same}} as the first generation (the A-frames {{between the first and second}} generation were the same although they were originally sourced from GM's G-body vehicle lineup), along with the steering knuckle, leaf springs, and differential assembly but <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> <b>axles</b> were greatly enhanced. Lower A-frames for the 2WD had 1/4 inch thicker steering stops - the second generation A-frames are commonly used as an upgrade for the first generation. Utility models (Blazer, Jimmy, Bravada) came with thicker front and rear sway bars.|$|R

50|$|The chassis {{was also}} new and {{features}} independent torsion bar front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> live rear <b>axle</b> with hypoid final drive. The braking system is Lockheed hydraulic.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{building}} was a crane for ironware handling. When the frames were taken in, they were fitted with <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> <b>axles,</b> <b>and</b> then turned the right way up. The next parts were the engine and transmission components. The final part for lorries was a pre-assembled cabin. Conventional bus chassis were delivered with bonnet and wings, but the forward control types left the factory without any body parts. After being painted, the vehicles left the assembly hall. Finally, every vehicle was tested on a -long test run on different roads and with various loads. The bus chassis were tested in a similar way; because there was no body, the drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against the weather conditions. The vehicles were handed over to the customers after final adjustments.|$|R
5000|$|Back-halved - a bodied drag {{racing car}} {{that has had}} its stock rear <b>suspension</b> removed <b>and</b> {{replaced}} with a four-link or ladder bar rear <b>suspension,</b> <b>and</b> narrowed rear <b>axle.</b> This arrangement allows for larger tires and better adjustability.|$|R
25|$|One year later, {{a revised}} model, called the 6C 2300 B was presented. In this version {{the engine was}} placed in a {{completely}} newly designed chassis, with individual front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> rear swing <b>axle,</b> <b>and</b> hydraulic brakes. The 6C-2300 was produced in 760 copies with rigid <b>axles</b> <b>and</b> 870 copies of the B-model.|$|R
50|$|The {{engineering}} {{of the car}} was conventional with coil sprung independent front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> a live <b>axle</b> at {{the rear}} with semi elliptic leaf springs. The braking used a Girling system with 9 in drums all round.|$|R
50|$|Differences between D2C and DEW98 {{are most}} {{noticeable}} in the suspension: The DEW98-based Lincoln LS uses a 4-wheel independent double wishbone suspension. The D2C platform's MacPherson strut front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> solid <b>axle</b> rear <b>suspension</b> are {{less expensive to}} produce than DEW's more complicated setup. D2C also shares components with other Ford platforms. These include Ford's global C1 platform, with which D2C shares front strut and rear trailing arm components.|$|R
50|$|The OT-64's engine, transmission, <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> <b>axles</b> were {{produced}} in Czechoslovakia. The engine {{was produced by}} Tatra. The gearbox was manufactured by Praga Hostiva≈ô. It has a pre-select Praga-Wilson gearbox, (5 forward +1 reverse gears.) A gear is selected using the gear stick then when the gear is required the left pedal (gear change action/clutch combined) is pressed to the floor, giving a hiss of air sound, on release of the pedal the dry plate clutch engages after about half the return spring controlled movement. The drive then passes to an auxiliary gearbox with low, neutral and high ratios which needs to be selected before moving off, for road/neutral/off road use, this gives option to the driver of 10 forward and 2 reverse ratios. The gear change pedal is hydraulic and on action opens an air valve which causes the selected gear to engage. The armored hull and weapons {{were produced}} in Poland.|$|R
50|$|Pickups come in many {{different}} varieties; Single Rear Wheels (SRWs), Dual Rear Wheels (DRWs), short bed, long bed, gas, diesel, 1/2 tons, 3/4 tons and 1 ton and up. There are also other factors in the equation such as tire rating. A large enough truck {{should be used to}} handle the payload of the camper. A DRW will provide more stability and payload than an SRW, however a DRW is more likely to get stuck in snow or sand, and is not as easy to drive around when the camper is off. A one-ton truck will carry more than a 3/4 ton truck, which in turn will carry more than a 1/2 ton truck. There is a significant frame difference between a 1/2 ton truck and a 3/4 truck. The frames on a 3/4-ton and 1-ton truck are essentially identical, Only the <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> <b>axles</b> tend to vary, as the 1-ton has dual rear wheels available.|$|R
50|$|The LG6 chassis {{is based}} on the one used on the V12 model {{lengthened}} by 3.5 in to cater for the longer engine fitted. Suspension is independent torsion bar front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> live rear <b>axle</b> with Spiral bevel gear final drive. The braking system is Lockheed hydraulic.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} other {{modifications}} were listed in the amendment (1/1V) to the TR7's homologation for the Group 4 TR7, such as larger front callipers and rear disk brakes. These were allowed {{from a list of}} [...] "Optional equipment which may be recognized without a minimum production". Other modifications that are not listed in the papers, such as <b>suspension</b> components <b>and</b> <b>axle</b> locating arms, etc., were given as freely allowed to be changed or added without need of being specifically recognized as part of the homologation process.|$|R
2500|$|The {{new model}} {{featured}} increased sound insulation <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> upgrades {{to isolate the}} interior from vibration and noise. The new compact car's luxury ride - [...] "aiming at a virtually noiseless boulevard ride" [...] was engineered by isolating the front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> rear <b>axle</b> from the car. All Concord models included special insulation in the dashboard and front floor, as well as sound-deadening coatings to all areas where plastic components joined. Top models also came with molded fiberglass acoustical headlining and sound absorption pads behind all interior panels.|$|R
25|$|The {{intermediate}} cars sit on type MD530 bogies {{with steel}} <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> an <b>axle</b> base of 2500mm. New wheels have {{a diameter of}} 920mm. They are replaced when they reach a diameter of 860mm. The cars are coupled 900mm above the rails by a semi-automatic coupling that was designed specifically for the ICE1. It couples two brake pipes, two electric trainlines, cables and two fibre optic cables. The passage between two cars is 1.1m wide and 2.05m high. Unlike on the InterCityExperimental, they are not positive locked on the outside.|$|R
50|$|The Noble uses a unibody frame {{based on}} a {{shortened}} Suzuki Alto platform. It carries the same MacPherson strut independent front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> a dead <b>axle</b> rear suspension with a Panhard stabilizing rod. The body is constructed using high tensile and ultra high tensile steel, a choice that makes the car somewhat heavy for its size at 875 kg.|$|R
50|$|Racing car kits {{were also}} produced, {{consisting}} {{of this type}} of body plus a fabricated X-frame racing chassis manufactured from steel channel sections welded face to face to form box sections. The chassis used mechanicals from a Holden FJ, with the front <b>suspension</b> crossmember <b>and</b> rear <b>axle</b> assembly being shortened to suit the narrower body.|$|R
50|$|The second {{series was}} manufactured, from 1937 on, the regular {{production}} of the 260D based on the Mercedes-Benz W143, with a four-speed fully synchronized transmission. The chassis was based on contemporary Mercedes technology and had transverse leaf spring independent front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> swing <b>axles</b> at the rear. The brakes were hydraulic. A range of body types were made including saloons, landaulettes and cabriolets. After World War II, the production of diesel engined cars was resumed with the Mercedes-Benz 170D in 1949. A surviving example of the car is displayed at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.|$|R

50|$|The 6C 2300 (2309 cc) was {{designed}} by Vittorio Jano as a lower-cost alternative to the 8C. In 1934 Alfa Romeo had become a state-owned enterprise. This year was presented a new 6C model with a newly designed, larger engine. Chassis technology, however, {{had been taken from}} the predecessor.One year later, a revised model, called the 6C 2300 B was presented. In this version the engine was placed in a completely newly designed chassis, with individual front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> rear swing <b>axle,</b> <b>and</b> hydraulic brakes. The 6C-2300 was produced in 760 copies with rigid <b>axles</b> <b>and</b> 870 copies of the B-model.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cars were}} {{initially}} built in small numbers for competition use, {{but they were}} exhibited and offered for road use at the 1927 Paris Motor Show. [...] They used a front-wheel-drive system featuring Gr√©goire's patented Tracta constant-velocity joint and sliding pillar independent front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> a live <b>axle</b> with quarter-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. 1100, 1200, 1500 and 1600 cc engines made by S.C.A.P. were available with optional Cozette supercharger. The 1500 cc car was claimed to reach 80 mph.|$|R
50|$|The first Piper GT road {{model to}} a design by Tony Hilder, was {{introduced}} at the January 1967 Racing Car Show and immediately afterwards entered production as a body/chassis unit for home completion. The front engine rear drive tubular steel chassis using Triumph Herald front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> Ford rear <b>axle</b> components could accommodate {{a variety of}} engines. Problems with the first few produced caused further production to be delayed until the following year when a substantially better developed version was introduced and {{became known as the}} GTT.|$|R
50|$|A {{similarly}} styled Tempest model {{featuring a}} Ford Anglia 105E engine and independent wishbone front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> live back <b>axle.</b> This was introduced around 1960-61, but only around 15 were produced. A Competition Tempest was also produced {{using the same}} front suspension, but with a highly tuned formula junior engine with twin 38 DCOEs. Fitted with a close-ratio gearbox and having an independent rear axle. Also from a Formula Junior with in board alfin drums. A Tornado Thunderbolt was also produced using a Triumph TR3 engine and a stronger chassis <b>and</b> <b>suspension.</b> Only one was built. This car survives today alongside the Competition Tempest, with the original constructor.|$|R
50|$|General Motors {{sought a}} {{replacement}} for their world car T-body Kadett / Gemini, and this time, instead of building one design on several continents, they decided to build a world car in one location and export it to several continents. As a considerable portion of the T-body manufacturing had been turned over to Isuzu in Japan for economic reasons, so would the manufacturing of the replacement. In 1984, Isuzu again commissioned Giorgetto Giugiaro {{who was responsible for}} the 117 Coup√© and the Piazza. This time, he was to design an economy car on the new front-wheel drive R-body platform. The R-body featured a MacPherson strut front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> beam <b>axle</b> rear <b>suspension,</b> which foreshadowed most of GM's offerings through their current model lineup. Giugiaro's design followed the Piazza design very closely in shape and detail, though the proportions made the Gemini appear shorter and taller in its three-door version, and a four-door sedan (notch back) was also designed.|$|R
50|$|Since 1974, {{gradually}} {{started the}} production of trucks 100.45, 100.05 flatbed and other variants of vehicles from 100 series. The first trucks were obliquely motor M series with a volume of 11 940 cm¬≥ and a power of 210, in 1978 was refurbished and known as M1 and in 1988 was again modernized to M2. New units reached thanks to turbo power up to 236 kW (320 hp), and longevity to overhaul 420,000 km. New and were 9 and 10-point synchronized gearbox Praga. Modernization in 1984 brought tilting cab <b>and</b> air <b>suspension</b> front <b>and</b> rear <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{semi-trailing}} {{arm suspension}} is a supple {{independent rear suspension}} system for automobiles where each wheel hub is located only by a large, roughly triangular arm that pivots at two points. Viewed from the top, the line formed by the two pivots is somewhere between parallel and perpendicular to the car's longitudinal axis; it is generally parallel to the ground. Trailing-arm <b>and</b> multilink <b>suspension</b> designs are much more commonly used for the rear wheels of a vehicle where they can allow for a flatter floor and more cargo room. Many small, front-wheel drive vehicles feature a MacPherson strut front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> trailing-arm rear <b>axle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{monocoque}} body shell {{was that of}} the four door Morris Oxford series II, the Cowley also sharing its torsion beam front <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> live rear <b>axle</b> but with smaller 8 in brake drums on early models. Some of the Oxford's exterior chrome has been removed to simplify the appearance and some has been replaced with stainless steel. Plastic-covered felt has been used in place of interior carpet. Quarter lights are fixed on the Cowley though the main windows wind down in the usual way. Steering was of the conventional rack and pinion type. The car had a top speed of just over 70 mi/h km/h.|$|R
5000|$|Both the Especial and Luxo had {{a manual}} gearbox, rear wheel drive, front {{independent}} <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> rear live <b>axle,</b> both with coil springs. In front, the suspension components were anchored to one side, {{set in the}} unibody with screws, later known as the subframe. The tires were the first tubeless tires used on a car manufactured in Brazil. It had a diaphragmatic (or [...] "Chinese hat") clutch spring, which was becoming popular throughout the world. The sporty Opala SS, originally only available with the [...] "250" [...] engine, was the first version to receive a four-speed manual gearbox. This was coupled with a tachometer and lots of matte black striping.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{application}} of mathematical modelling {{in the field of}} directional behaviour of a vehicle. A model of a bus has been created in the simulation system environment. Its steady state and transient directional behaviour has been compared with experimental results. The structure of the model contains parametrical substructures of the front wheel <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> rear <b>axle.</b> The ride of the vehicle model along the general track is performed by an approximate model of the driver behaviour. The influence of vehicle load on its directional properties has been shown. The control strategy for all wheel steering, that is able to ensure vehicle neutral behaviour independent on lateral acceleration level, has been formulaed. The steady state as well as transient response of the vehicle with active elements in the rear axle guide has been analysed. The results of the simulations show, that the achieved neutral vehicle behaviour is not dependent on the vehicle load. The influence of the control strategy parameters on the vehicle transient response has been studied. Available from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
5000|$|Bigfoot #4 was rebuilt in 1990 after a {{crash in}} Nashville, Tennessee that {{destroyed}} the entire <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> drivetrain of the truck. Bigfoot #4 received new wheels, <b>suspension,</b> <b>and</b> rear <b>axle.</b> The truck was rebuilt using a [...] "hybrid" [...] suspension that utilized nitrogen shock technology found in Bigfoot #8 and #9. After touring in early 1991, driver John Piant left Bigfoot, and Bigfoot #4's touring schedule {{was completed by}} Dan Runte and Gene Patterson. Prior {{to the start of}} the 1991 PENDA Points Series season, Bigfoot #4 was re-branded as Snake Bite. The Ford F-Series fiberglass truck body was replaced with a hand-sculpted 3D fiberglass body that made the hood, fender, grille, and portions of the doors resemble a red, yellow, and green venomous snake with fangs. Snake Bite debuted in April 1991 on the PENDA Points Series at the 6th Annual 4-Wheel and Off-Road Jamboree Spring Nationals held at the Memphis Motorsports Park in Memphis, Tennessee. Gene Patterson drove Snake Bite under the persona of [...] "Colt Cobra" [...] hailing from the fictional town of [...] "Cobra Creek, Colorado" [...] and wore a red and yellow racing mask that resembled the design of the snake truck body. Other drivers of Snake Bite have used the [...] "Colt Cobra," [...] "Ricky Rattler," [...] or [...] "Vic Venom" [...] personas.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} compete in {{international}} rallying, the car had to be homologated; for Group 4, the class the HS was {{to compete in}}, this meant building 400 production vehicles for public sale. Vauxhall created a far more powerful Chevette variant by fitting the 2.3litre slant-four engine, using a 16-valve cylinder head which Vauxhall was developing - though the rally cars used the Lotus 16-valve head until a rule change by the FIA banned them in 1978. Fitted with two Stromberg carburettors the engine developed 135 bhp. <b>Suspension</b> <b>and</b> rear <b>axle</b> were from the Opel Kadett C GT/E and the gearbox was a Getrag five-speed. Chevrolet Vega alloy wheels (similar in appearance to the Avon wheels used on the droopsnoot Firenza) were used, {{as well as a}} newly developed glass-reinforced plastic air dam. The result was a very fast and well handling, if rather unrefined, road car. Like the Droopsnoot Firenza, the HS was available only in silver, with red highlighting and a bright red, black and tartan interior; though (partly to help sell unsold vehicles) some cars were repainted in other colours, such the black Mamos Garage HS-X.|$|R
