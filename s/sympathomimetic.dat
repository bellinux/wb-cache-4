5|$|As {{with most}} <b>sympathomimetic</b> stimulants {{there appear to}} be {{significant}} side effects associated with BZP use. BZP reportedly produces insomnia and a mild to severe hangover after the drug effect wears off, however, some manufacturers in New Zealand have started including recovery pills which contain 5-HTP and vitamins which allegedly ease these hangovers.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is a weak {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), {{and should not}} be used concomitantly with other MAOIs, large amounts of tyramine-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or smoked and pickled foods), or serotonergic drugs. There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine and sertraline. It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of <b>sympathomimetic</b> drugs such as pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine. It should also not be given in combination with pethidine (meperidine) under any circumstance due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is {{the most common form of}} amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of <b>sympathomimetic</b> drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that pseudoephedrine, among other <b>sympathomimetic</b> agents, {{may be associated with}} the occurrence of stroke.|$|E
25|$|Secondary Raynaud's {{is managed}} {{primarily}} by treating {{the underlying cause}} and as primary Raynaud's, avoiding triggers, such as cold, emotional and environmental stress, vibrations and repetitive motions, and avoiding smoking (including passive smoking) and <b>sympathomimetic</b> drugs.|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{symptoms}} generally resolve themselves after 24 to 48 hours. Supportive {{treatment for}} the symptoms is usually administered. Because extreme vomiting occurs, decontamination (e.g., stomach pumping or the ingestion of activated charcoal) is usually not implemented unless ingestion has occurred within one hour. Atropine is usually administered to counteract the low heart rate, and <b>sympathomimetic</b> drugs and liquids administered to raise the blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|The main {{differences}} of the synephrine isomers compared for example to the ephedrines are the hydroxy-substitutions on the benzene ring. Synephrines are direct <b>sympathomimetic</b> drugs while the ephedrines are both {{direct and indirect}} sympathomimetics. One {{of the main reasons}} for these differential effects is the obviously increased polarity of the hydroxy-substituted phenyl ethyl amines which renders them less able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier as illustrated in the examples for tyramine and the amphetamine analogs.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of the {{epiglottis}} {{is known}} as epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is mainly caused by Haemophilus influenzae. A person with epiglottitis may have a fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. For this reason, acute epiglottitis is considered a medical emergency, {{because of the risk}} of obstruction of the pharynx. Epiglottitis is often managed with antibiotics, racemic epinephrine (a <b>sympathomimetic</b> bronchodilator that is delivered by aerosol), and may require tracheal intubation or a tracheostomy if breathing is difficult. Behind the root of the tongue is an epiglottic vallecula which is an important anatomical landmark in intubation.|$|E
25|$|Propranolol is {{classified}} as a non-cardioselective sympatholytic beta blocker that crosses the blood–brain barrier. It is lipid soluble and also has sodium channel blocking effects. Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker; that is, it blocks the action of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) at both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. It has little intrinsic <b>sympathomimetic</b> activity, but has strong membrane stabilizing activity (only at high blood concentrations, e.g. overdose). Propranolol is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and exert effects in {{the central nervous system}} in addition to its peripheral activity.|$|E
25|$|The 5-HT2c {{receptor}} agonist Fenfluramine (market names Pondimin, Ponderax and Adifax) {{was discovered in}} 1972 {{as a result of}} research performed to identify anorectic compounds lacking the effects of psycho-stimulants and <b>sympathomimetic</b> agents (such as amphetamines). Prior to the discovery of fenfluramine, amphetamines were the primary form of anorectic drugs available, however the side effects made them difficult to use. Fenfluramine's anorectic effect is achieved through an increase in serotonin levels, imparting a sensation of fullness, which leads to a lower intake of food. Fenfluramine was sold as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, dexfenfluramine and levofenfluramine.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin {{should not}} be used within 14days of using a monoamine oxidase {{inhibitor}} (MAOIs) such as phenelzine due to the potential for hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome to develop. Its use in those taking potent CYP2D6 inhibitors such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, bupropion, and quinidine is recommended against due to the potential for its accumulation in the absence of full CYP2D6 catalytic activity. Hepatic enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates are advised against in patients receiving TCAs like doxepin due to the potential for problematically rapid metabolism of doxepin to occur in these individuals. <b>Sympathomimetic</b> agents may have their effects potentiated by TCAs like doxepin. Doxepin also may potentiate the adverse effects of anticholinergic agents such as benztropine, atropine and hyoscine (scopolamine). Tolazamide, when used in conjunction with doxepin has been associated with a case of severe hypoglycaemia in a type II diabetic individual. Cimetidine may influence the absorption of doxepin. Alcohol may potentiate some of the CNS depressant effects of doxepin. Antihypertensive agents may have their effects mitigated by doxepin. Cotreatment with CNS depressants such as the benzodiazepines can cause additive CNS depression. Co-treatment with thyroid hormones may also increase the potential for adverse reactions.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{experiments}} on frogs, the Japanese group {{carried out a}} series of classical pharmacological investigations of candicine on cats and rabbits, and on various isolated animal organs/tissues. In rabbits, doses of 0.6mg/kg, i.v., of candicine produced respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances lasting about 15 minutes. Body temperature was not affected; there was also mydriasis followed by miosis, and hypersalivation. In rabbits, i.v. doses of 2.1mg/kg produced apnea, followed by death. In anesthetized cats, doses of 0.06–0.12mg/kg, iv., also caused respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances: although the details were concentration-and time-dependent, the ultimate effects were ones of sustained respiratory stimulation and elevated blood pressure; the hypertension was not inhibited by atropine, but was antagonized by hexamethonium. Candicine caused contraction of the cat nictitating membrane. A concentration of 0.012mg/mL applied to the isolated guinea pig atrium caused a decrease in the amplitude and rate of contractions, these effects being enhanced by eserine, but inhibited by atropine pre-treatment. Concentrations of 3-6μg/mL produced contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum which were inhibited by pre-treatment with atropine, hexamethonium, tubocurarine or cocaine, but were not affected by the presence of pyribenzamine or chlorpheniramine. Summarizing the results of these and other observations, the authors concluded that: candicine was primarily a stimulant of autonomic ganglia; it liberated catecholamines from the adrenal medulla; it showed muscarine-like and <b>sympathomimetic</b> effects in some assays, and it was a neuromuscular blocker of the depolarizing type. In many of these respects, candicine resembled nicotine and dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP).|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} {{led to the}} central nervous system. It was taken by Marthe Vogt, a refugee from Germany who at that time worked with John Henry Gaddum in the Institute of Pharmacology of the University of Edinburgh. ″The {{presence}} of noradrenaline and adrenaline in the brain has been demonstrated by von Euler (1946) and Holtz (1950). These substances were supposed, undoubtedly correctly, {{to occur in the}} cerebral vasomotor <= vasoconstrictor> nerves. The present work is concerned with the question whether these <b>sympathomimetic</b> amines, besides their role as transmitters at vasomotor endings, play a part in the function of the central nervous tissue itself. In this paper, these amines will be referred to as sympathin, since they were found invariably to occur together, with noradrenaline representing the major component, as is characteristic for the transmitter of the peripheral sympathetic system.″ Vogt created a detailed map of noradrenaline in the dog brain. Its uneven distribution, not reflecting the distribution of vasomotor nerves, and its persistence after removal of the superior cervical ganglia made it ″tempting to assign to the cerebral sympathin a transmitter role like that which we assign to the sympathin found in the sympathetic ganglia and their postganglionic fibres.″ Her assignment was confirmed, the finishing touch being the visualization of the noradrenaline as well as adrenaline and (see below) dopamine pathways in the central nervous system with the formaldehyde fluorescence method developed by Nils-Åke Hillarp (1916–1965) and Bengt Falck (born 1927) in Sweden and by immunochemistry techniques.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{one case}} of <b>sympathomimetic</b> {{toxicity}} {{was reported in}} the UK after a person took 0.2g of mephedrone orally, and after this did not achieve the desired effect, subcutaneously injected 3.8g mixed with water into his thighs. Shortly afterwards, the user [...] "developed palpitations, blurred tunnel vision, chest pressure and sweating". The patient was treated with 1mg of lorazepam and the <b>sympathomimetic</b> features decreased and the user was discharged within six hours of arrival. One case of serotonin syndrome has been reported, where the patient was already prescribed fluoxetine and olanzapine, and then took 40 tablets containing mephedrone in one night. He was treated with lorazepam and discharged 15 hours after admission. Both enantiomers of methcathinone, which differs only in the lack of the methyl group on the aryl ring when compared to mephedrone, {{have been shown to be}} toxic to rat dopamine neurons, and the S-enantiomer was also toxic against serotonin neurons. Simon Gibbons and Mire Zloh of the School of Pharmacy, University of London stated, based on the chemical similarities between methcathinone and mephedrone, [...] "it is highly likely that mephedrone will display neurotoxicity". However, Brunt and colleagues stated, [...] "extreme caution" [...] should be used when inferring the toxicity of mephedrone from methcathinone, noting some of the toxicity associated with methcathinone is due to manganese impurities related to its synthesis, rather than the compound itself. They concluded more experimental research is needed to investigate the toxicity of mephedrone.|$|E
500|$|... poisoning, <b>sympathomimetic</b> toxicity, or {{worsening}} psychiatric condition. The condition {{most often}} confused with serotonin syndrome is neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). The clinical features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome share some features {{which can make}} differentiating them difficult. In both conditions, autonomic dysfunction and altered mental status develop. However, they are actually very different conditions with different underlying dysfunction (serotonin excess vs dopamine blockade). Both the time course and the clinical features of NMS differ significantly from those of serotonin toxicity. Serotonin toxicity has a rapid onset after the administration of a serotonergic drug and responds to serotonin blockade such as drugs like chlorpromazine and cyproheptadine. Dopamine receptor blockade (NMS) has a slow onset and typically evolves over several days after administration of a neuroleptic drug and responds to dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine.|$|E
500|$|Amphetamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it phenylisopropylamine; its stimulant effects remained unknown until 1927, {{when it was}} independently resynthesized by Gordon Alles and reported to have <b>sympathomimetic</b> properties. Amphetamine had no medical use until late 1933, when Smith, Kline and French began selling it as an inhaler under the brand name Benzedrine as a decongestant. Benzedrine sulfate was introduced 3years later and was used to treat {{a wide variety of}} medical conditions, including narcolepsy, obesity, low blood pressure, low libido, and chronic pain, among others. During World War II, amphetamine and methamphetamine were used extensively by both the Allied and Axis forces for their stimulant and performance-enhancing effects. As the addictive properties of the drug became known, governments began to place strict controls on the sale of amphetamine. [...] For example, during the early 1970s in the United States, amphetamine became a scheduleII controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. In spite of strict government controls, amphetamine has been used legally or illicitly by people from a variety of backgrounds, including authors, musicians, mathematicians, and athletes.|$|E

2500|$|Pseudoephedrine is a <b>sympathomimetic</b> amine. Its {{principal}} {{mechanism of}} action relies on its direct action on the adrenergic receptor system. [...] The vasoconstriction that pseudoephedrine produces {{is believed to be}} principally an α-adrenergic receptor response.|$|E
2500|$|... β-blockers are sympatholytic drugs. Some β-blockers {{partially}} {{activate the}} receptor while preventing catecholamines from binding to the receptor, making them partial agonists. They provide {{a background of}} sympathetic activity, while preventing normal and enhanced sympathetic activity. These β-blockers possess intrinsic <b>sympathomimetic</b> activity (ISA).

Although DCI had no clinical utility, a change in the compound did provide a clinical candidate, pronethalol, which was introduced in 1962.|$|E
2500|$|Aside from {{physiologic}} {{causes of}} xerostomia, iatrogenic effects of medications {{are the most}} common cause. A medication which is known to cause xerostomia may be termed xerogenic. Over 500 medications produce xerostomia as a side effect (see table). [...] Sixty-three percent of the top 200 most commonly prescribed drugs in the United States are xerogenic. The likelihood of xerostomia increases in relation to the total number of medications taken, whether the individual medications are xerogenic or not. The sensation of dryness usually starts shortly after starting the offending medication or after increasing the dose. Anticholinergic, <b>sympathomimetic,</b> or diuretic drugs are usually responsible.|$|E

The number of instances of fatal MDMA intoxication is low relative to its usage rates. In most fatalities MDMA was not the only drug involved. Acute toxicity is mainly caused by serotonin syndrome and <b>sympathomimetic</b> effects. [...] MDMA's toxicity in overdose may be exacerbated by caffeine, with which it is frequently cut (mixed with to increase volume). A scheme for management of acute MDMA toxicity has been published focusing on treatment of hyperthermia, hyponatraemia, seratonin syndrome, and multiple organ failure.|$|E
2500|$|Synephrine, or, more specifically, p-synephrine, is an alkaloid, {{occurring}} {{naturally in}} some plants and animals, {{and also in}} approved drugs products as its m-substituted analog known as neo-synephrine. p-Synephrine (or formerly Sympatol and oxedrine [...] ) and m-synephrine {{are known for their}} longer acting adrenergic effects compared to norepinephrine. This substance is present at very low concentrations in common foodstuffs such as orange juice and other orange (Citrus species) products, both of the [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "bitter" [...] variety. The preparations used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), also known as Zhi Shi, are the immature and dried whole oranges from Citrus aurantium (Fructus Aurantii Immaturus). Extracts of the same material or purified synephrine are also marketed in the US, sometimes in combination with caffeine, as a weight-loss-promoting dietary supplement for oral consumption. While the traditional preparations have been in use for millennia as a component of TCM-formulas, synephrine itself is not an approved OTC drug. As a pharmaceutical, m-synephrine is still used as a <b>sympathomimetic</b> (i.e. for its hypertensive and vasoconstrictor properties), mostly by injection for the treatment of emergencies such as shock, and rarely orally for the treatment of bronchial problems associated with asthma and hay-fever.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{synthetic}} drug, synephrine {{first appeared in}} Europe in the late 1920s, {{under the name of}} Sympatol. One of the earliest papers describing its pharmacological and toxicological properties was written by Lasch, who obtained it from the Viennese company Syngala. By 1930, Sympatol was referred to as a Boehringer product, while one of the first US Patents describing its preparation and use was assigned to Frederick Stearns & Co. in 1933. Despite the date of this patent, clinical and pharmacological research on synephrine obtained from Frederick Stearns & Co was being carried out in the US by 1930. Writing in 1931, Hartung reported that in 1930 the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association had accepted synephrine for inclusion in its list of “New and Non-Official Remedies” as an agent for the treatment, by either oral or parenteral administration, [...] "of attacks of hay fever, asthma, coughing, spasms of asthma and pertussis (whooping cough)." [...] However, synephrine was dropped from the Council's list in 1934, and its apparent re-advertising as a new drug by the Stearns company ten years later elicited a scathing comment from the Editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The third edition (1965) of Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine stated, with reservations, that synephrine was [...] "advertised as an antihistaminic {{to be used in the}} treatment of the common cold...", under the trade name of [...] "Synephrin Tartrate", and indicated that the dose was 100mg, given intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. Published in 1966, the Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry described synephrine (in the form of its racemic tartrate) as a <b>sympathomimetic</b> agent that was [...] "less effective than epinephrine", and which had been used [...] for the treatment of chronic hypotension, collapse due to shock, and other conditions leading to hypotension. In a later (1972) textbook, synephrine was described as a drug, sold in Europe, that was administered in situations involving shock, such as surgical or bacteremic shock, and spinal anesthesia-related shock. The recommended dose was given here as 25–50mg, by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration.|$|E
