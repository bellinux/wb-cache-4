Account is {{taken of the}} irregularity polarizations, scale length and the magnetic dip angle of the echo. Ray tracing equations are defined for wave propagation in a horizontally stratified ionosphere which has been bathed with HF signals and therefore contains wavelike structures. Irregularities polarized within the meridian plane are found to cause the <b>spread</b> F <b>echoes,</b> while perpendicularly polarized irregularities do not. A magnetic dip angle of 5 deg must be exceeded for the spread F to become strong. The irregularities need scale lengths exceeding 100 m.

30|$|Another {{important}} feature of the equatorial ionosphere is the occurrence of <b>spread</b> <b>echoes</b> in the F-region on the ionograms following {{the rise of the}} F-layer after sunset, known as the Equatorial Spread-F (ESF), and first reported by Booker and Wells (1938). Chandra and Rastogi (1972) were the first to describe the spread-F at equatorial stations to be of the range-spreading type to begin with and to transform itself to a frequency-spreading type at a later stage. It was important that they showed that the ESF develops only after the evening reversal of the electric field. Recently, Hoang et al. (2010) have described the characteristics of spread-F at Ho Chi Minh city (10.5 °N, 106.3 °E, dip lat. 2.9 °N) in Vietnam.

40|$|An ionospheric topside sounder {{is a high}} {{frequency}} radar system that is located above the ionosphere, ideally on-board a polar orbiting satellite to provide global coverage. The previous eight satellite sounders have measured the critical frequency of the F 2 ionosphere region using traditional swept frequency methods. The most expensive part of these missions however {{is considered to be}} the large network of ground support stations required for collecting and processing data. This information has been invaluable in improving our global understanding of the upper ionosphere and the accuracy of critical frequency maps used by HF radio engineers to calculate communications routes and the optimum frequencies for early warning OTH radars. A new technique for the direct detection of critical frequency has been developed, which is called the 'Dispersion Method'. Real data from previous sounders is used in the development and verification of this method. This sounder will not only provide traditional lonograms but detects critical frequency and <b>spread</b> <b>echoes</b> directly from the dispersion of a returning radar pulse. This new method does not use traditional lonograms with their inherent processing complexity and is an order faster than any previous sounder. The 'Dispersion Method' therefore resolves the problems encountered with the past topside sounder missions and produces large quantities of real time data autonomously when required. Previous sounding satellites had little memory capacity, no on-board processing capability, required large antennas and transmitters on satellites with a mass of between 150 and 250 kg. This meant power requirements of about 60 watts per orbit average. A feasibility study to place a third generation topside sounder into low Earth orbit on a 50 kg microsatellite with an orbit average power capacity of only 20 watts has been successfully completed...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to {{implement}} a DVB-T receiver on Coresonic’s DSP-processor and attempt to evaluate how to design a receiver that is robust against very strong echoes with a long delay. Long delayed echoes is very common in Single Frequency Networks (SFN) which is why focus was put on finding algorithms that work well in SFN. The thesis involved analyzing different algorithms involved in making a DVB-T receiver where the focus {{was to find a}} good channel estimation algorithm. The thesis also included programming the DSP-processor and making some smaller modifications to their hardware solution to integrate their error correction hardware. After finding relevant articles with promising algorithms a small transmitter, channel and receiver was modeled in Matlab in order to try the different algorithms. After testing the different algorithms some of the simpler ones were first implemented to quickly get a working receiver. The implementation was however time consuming and all of the most appropriate algorithms to better avert the effects of long and strong echoes where not implemented. This means some algorithms where only analyzed and discussed. The receiver performance is tested and simulated in Coresonic’s DSP simulator. The receiver does not fully meet the requirements set by NorDig when it comes to handling long delay <b>spread</b> <b>echoes</b> with a magnitude of 0 db when tested in the DSP processor simulator.

The radio receiver receives several echoes of the same signal, and the constructive or destructive interference among these echoes (also known as self-interference) may result in fading.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the satellite laser ranging is the millimeter precision and accuracy. To achieve this goal, all the individual contributors to the ranging error budget must be well below millimeter level. The best existing ground based ranging systems are capable to achieve millimeter ranging precision when ranging to short distance terrestrial targets. However, ranging to Earth orbiting satellites the best precision obtained is typically 3 time worse, about 3 millimeters RMS. As this value is obtained even for satellite targets not <b>spreading</b> the <b>echo</b> signal, there is a speculation, that the remaining contribution to the random error budget is contributed from the atmosphere. The ground targets ranging experiments demonstrated an increase of the ranging jitter {{by a factor of}} 0. 9 psec for 100 meters atmospheric path increase [12] thus supporting this idea, as well.

40|$|International audienceThe aspect {{sensitivity}} of VHF echoes from field aligned irregularities (FAI) within meteor trails and thin ionization layers is studied using numerical models. Although the maximum power is obtained when a radar is pointed {{perpendicular to the}} field line (B), substantial power can be obtained off the B direction if the ionization trail/layer is thin. When the FAI length along B is 20 m, the power observed 6 ° off B is about 10 db below that perpendicular to the B direction. Meteoric FAI echoes can potentially {{be used to determine}} the diffusion rate in the mesopause region. Based on the aspect sensitivity analysis, we conclude that the range <b>spread</b> trail <b>echoes</b> far off B observed by powerful VHF radars are likely due to overdense meteors. Our simulation also shows that ionospheric FAI echoes can have an altitude smearing effect of about 4 km if the vertical extension of a FAI-layer is around 100 m, which has often been observed at Arecibo. The altitude smearing effect can account {{for the fact that the}} Es-layers observed by the Arecibo incoherent scatter radar are typically much narrower than FAI-layers and the occurrence of double spectral peaks around the Es-layer altitude in FAI echoes...|$|R

In OFDM system, inter-carrier interference (ICI) occurs due to FO which is caused by an oscillator of a transmitter and receiver, and degrades {{the performance of}} a receiver. Thus, FO should be estimated and compensated to improve {{the performance of a}} receiver. FO can be normalized to subcarrier spacing in OFDM system, and consists of fractional frequency offset (FFO) and integer frequency offset (IFO) accordingly. FFO is estimated in time domain using cyclic prefix (CP), and IFO is estimated in frequency domain with unique synchronization sequence (USS) of preamble due to the structure of DVB-C 2 frame. Because the estimation of FO is influenced by CP length and echo channels shown in the DVB-C 2 specification, we simulate the mean square error (MSE) of FO estimation w. r. t CP length and echo channels. The results of simulation show that MSE is reduced as CP length is longer. In addition, MSE is improved as E b/N 0 increases. However, MSE of the estimated FO tends to saturate at high E b/N 0 when echo channels are used. In addition, it increases when the maximum delay <b>spread</b> between <b>echo</b> channels is longer. shows the two types of echo channels; echo channel 1 (EC 1) and echo channel 2 (EC 2) [2], [3].

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the pseudo noise (PN) {{generating}} method for digital audio watermarking using time-spread echo hiding. In time-spread echo based audio watermarking, the secret payload {{is embedded in the}} form of multiple <b>echoes</b> <b>spread</b> by a pseudo noise sequence and the pseudo noise sequence is used as secret key. Generally, the pseudo noise sequence is required to be uncorrelated with other sequence and therefore typically generated by an M-sequence generator. In this paper, we propose a key sequence generating method which generates a key sequence from an audio signal. By using the new key sequence generated from an audio signal instead of an M-sequence, the key information users have to remember is their secret audio signal but not a complicated random PN key. Therefore, the availability of digital audio watermarking would be improved. After introducing the new key generation method, we evaluated the proposed key sequence.

40|$|Ultrasonic signal {{processing}} presents several challenges {{with respect to}} both noise removal and interpretation. The interference of unwanted reflections from material grain structure can render the data extremely noisy and mask the detection of small flaws. It is therefore imperative to separate the flaw reflections from grain noise. The interpretation or classification of ultrasonic signals in general is relatively difficult due {{to the complexity of}} the physical process and similarity of signals from various classes of reflectors;Adaptive noise cancellation techniques are ideally suited for reducing spatially varying noise due to the grain structure of material in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation. In this research, a multi-stage adaptive noise cancellation (MANC) scheme is proposed for reducing spatially varying grain noise and enhancing flaw detection in ultrasonic signals. The overall scheme is based on the use of an adaptive least mean square error (LMSE) filter with primary and reference signals derived from two adjacent positions of the transducers. Since grain noise is generally uncorrelated, in contrast to the correlated flaw echoes, adaptive filtering algorithms exploit the correlation properties of signals in a C-scan image to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the output signal;A neural network-based signal classification system is proposed for the interpretation of ultrasonic signals obtained from inspection of welds, where signals have to be classified as resulting from porosity, slag, lack of fusion, or cracks in the weld region. Standard techniques rely on differences in individual A-scans to classify the signals. This thesis investigates the need for investigating signal features that incorporate the effects of beam <b>spread</b> and <b>echo</b> dynamics. Such effects call for data interpretation schemes that include a neighborhood of A-scans carrying information about a reflector. Several ultrasonic signal features based on the information in a two-dimensional array of ultrasonic waveforms, ranging from the estimation of statistical characteristics of signals to two and three-dimensional transform-based methods, are evaluated. A two-dimensional scan of ultrasonic testing is also represented in the form of images (B- and B 2 ̆ 7 -scans). Multidimensional signal and image-processing algorithms are used to analyze the images. Two and three-dimensional Fourier transforms are applied to ultrasonic data that are inherently three-dimensional in nature (2 spatial and 1 time).

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{experimentally}} and theoretically con-firms {{the validity}} of the definition proposed by Das for computing the complex characteristic impedance of the first higher order 1) microstrip mode. The normalized complex propagation constant and complex characteristic impedance of the microstrip obtained by the rigorous full-wave integral-equation method is also presented. To better understand the circuit behavior of the leaky mode at the respective frequencies, the results are analyzed in both frequency and transformed steepest descent plane. A differential time-domain reflectometry (TDR) experiment shows that the experimental results are in excellent agreement with the time-domain plots obtained theoretically by the inverse discrete Fourier transform of the transmission line modeled by the dispersive characteristic. The propagation characteristics of the echoed signals in the time domain, which are reflected from the open end of the leaky line, are analyzed in detail using the corresponding group velocity of the 1 mode. The wide <b>spread</b> of the <b>echoed</b> signals in the time domain is the direct result of the highly dispersive group velocity. The slowest group velocity is in the leaky region. The time-to-frequency conversion of the mea-sured TDR data reveals that the reflection, leaky, and propagation zones coexist simultaneously for the 1 mode propagation. The conversion also accurately assesses the attenuation constant of the 1 mode if the attenuation is not too high. The Fourier transform of the TDR responses also simultaneously yields the input reflection coefficient (11) and the complex characteristic impedance. The complex characteristic impedance extracted from the TDR responses also agrees closely with the theoretical data.

Interferometry {{measurements}} of range <b>spread</b> meteor trail <b>echoes</b> (RSTEs; {{also known as}} nonspecular echoes) have provided new insights into both the irregularity structures in meteor trails and lower-thermospheric winds (LTWs). In this study, we used trail echoes observed with the newly installed Sanya (18. 4 °N, 109. 6 °E) 47. 5 MHz VHF coherent radar and the Sanya all-sky meteor radar to estimate instantaneous zonal and hourly averaged meridional winds from RSTEs and hourly averaged zonal and meridional winds from large numbers of specular meteor echoes. The mean height variations in both the zonal and meridional winds estimated from the RSTEs were generally consistent with those estimated from specular meteor echoes below 96 km. This gives validity to the technique proposed recently by Oppenheim et al. (2009) and suggests that RSTE measurements made with a small radar {{can be used to}} investigate LTWs, whereas this had previously been limited to larger radars such as the Jicamarca radar. However, some observations show significant differences in wind magnitude at individual heights at times. The results of RSTE measurements show the presence of an intense westward wind with a speed near 100 ms− 1. In contrast, the specular meteor zonal winds were generally less than 50 ms− 1. On the other hand, the meridional drift of RSTEs derived from the meridional Doppler velocity at higher altitudes shows a very poor correlation with the specular meteor meridional wind. Potential causes for the discrepancy in wind estimates obtained from RSTE and specular meteor trail echoes are discussed. Guozhu Li, Baiqi Ning, Lianhuan Hu, Yen-Hsyang Chu, I. M. Reid and B. K.

What is the magnetic contribution of the lower crust to marine magnetic anomalies? Hole 1256 D is located on 15 Ma crust in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (6 ° 44. 163 ?N, 91 ° 56. 061 ?W). Oceanic crust that formed at a superfast spreading rate (> 200 mm/y) was specifically targeted to exploit the observed relationship between spreading rate and depth to axial low-velocity zones, thought to be magma chambers, seismically imaged at active mid-ocean ridges. This was a deliberate strategy to reduce the drilling distance to gabbroic rocks because thick sequences of lavas and dikes have proved difficult to penetrate in the past. Previous cruises to ODP Site 1256 (ODP Leg 206; IODP Expedition 309 / 312) have achieved their leg- and expedition-specific objectives but not the overarching strategic goals of the Superfast Spreading Crust campaign to understand magmatic accretion at fast-spreading ocean ridges. However, the three previous cruises achieved the first complete sampling of intact upper oceanic crust and successfully drilled through ~ 800 m of erupted lavas and thin (~ 345 m) sheeted dike complex and sampled gabbros at ~ 1157 meters subbasement. The lowermost 100 m of the hole is a complex dike–plutonic transition zone and comprises two gabbro lenses intruded into very strongly contact metamorphosed, granoblastically recrystallized sheeted dikes. During Expedition 335, we reentered Hole 1256 D more than 5 years after our last visit and encountered and overcame a number of significant engineering challenges, each unique but of natures not unexpected in a deep, uncased marine borehole into igneous rocks. The patient, persistent efforts of the rig floor teams cleared a major obstruction at 920 meters below seafloor (mbsf) that initially prevented reentry into the hole to its full depth (1507 mbsf). The 920 – 960 mbsf interval was then cemented to stabilize the borehole wall. A short phase of coring deepened Hole 1256 D ~ 13 m before the C- 9 hard formation coring bit failed and was ground to a smooth stump. A progressive, logical course of action was then undertaken to clear the bottom of the hole of metal junk from the failed coring bit, open up a short interval of undergauge hole, and remove a very large amount of drilling cuttings from the hole. This was successfully completed, and the hole is open to its full depth (1521. 6 mbsf). The hole-cleaning phase was followed by wireline caliper and temperature measurements of the complete hole to assist with cementing operations to stabilize the lowermost 10 m of the hole and the problematic interval at 910 – 940 mbsf. These remedial efforts should facilitate reentry and coring on a future return to Hole 1256 D. In addition to the few cores drilled, the junk baskets deployed during the successive fishing runs {{to the bottom of the}} hole recovered a unique collection of samples, including large cobbles (as large as 5 kg), angular rubble, and fine cuttings of principally strongly to completely recrystallized granoblastic basalt with minor gabbroic rocks and evolved plutonic rocks. The large blocks exhibit intrusive, structural, and textural relationships, along with overprinting and crosscutting hydrothermal alteration and metamorphic paragenetic sequences that hitherto have not been observed because of the small diameter of drill cores and the very low recovery of the granoblastic dikes cored so far. The high extent of metamorphic recrystallization exhibited by the granoblastic basalt, combined with operational factors, provides strong evidence that most of this material comes from the lowermost reaches of Hole 1256 D (~ 1495 to ~ 1522 mbsf). Including the ~ 60 m thick zone of granoblastic dikes that reside above the uppermost gabbros, the dike–gabbro transition zone at Site 1256 is > 170 m thick, of which > 100 m is recrystallized granoblastic basalt. When the textural and contact relationships exhibited by these samples are placed in the geological context of the Hole 1256 D stratigraphy, a vision emerges of a complex, dynamic thermal boundary layer zone. This region of the crust between the principally hydrothermal domain of the upper crust and the intrusive magmatic domain of the lower crust is one of evolving geological conditions. An intimate coupling among temporally and spatially intercalated magmatic, hydrothermal, partial melting, intrusive, metamorphic, and retrograde processes is recorded in the recovered samples. Expedition 335 left Hole 1256 D after making only a very modest advance, and we have yet to recover the samples of cumulate gabbros required to test models of ocean ridge magmatic accretion and the intensity of hydrothermal cooling at depth. However, a remarkable sample suite of granoblastic basalt with minor gabbros, some of which intrude previously recrystallized dikes, was recovered and provides a detailed picture of a rarely sampled critical interval of the oceanic crust. Most importantly, the hole has been stabilized, cleared to its full depth, and is ready for deepening in the near future...|$|R
