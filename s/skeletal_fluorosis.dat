The batch adsorption technique was followed at neutral pH {{as a function of}} contact time, adsorbent dose, adsorbate concentration, tempera-ture and the effect of co-anions. The data indicate that the prepared adsorbent surface sites are heterogeneous in nature and that fits into a heterogeneous site-binding mo-del. The present system followed the Redlich–Peterson isotherm as well as the Lang-muir adsorption isotherm model. Lagergren pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, intra particle diffusion and Elovich kinetics were modeled to describe the adsorption rate of fluoride, and determined as this scheme followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. The calculated enthalpy change, ΔH°, and entropy change, ΔS°, for the adsorption process were 8. 725 kJ/mol and 0. 033 J/mol K, respectively, and showed endothermic experience. Instrumental analysis of XRD, FTIR and SEM gives an idea about the fluo-ride binding ability of adsorbent.

Forty albino rats were randomly assigned to four groups. The first group served as control and received only tap water. The second group received sodium fluoride (200 ppm) through drinking water. The third group received T. indica fruit pulp extract (200 mg/kg body weight) alone and the fourth group received the T. indica fruit pulp extract (200 mg/kg body weight) along with fluorinated drinking water (200 ppm) daily by gavage for a period of 90 days. The level of hydroxyproline and expression of type 1 collagen gene using quantitative real time PCR in the tibia bone decreased significantly with continuous exposure to sodium fluoride. Co-administration of T. indica fruit pulp extract during exposure to fluoride through drinking water restored the level of calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase in serum and the concentration of hydroxyproline in urine. It increased the level of hydroxyproline and expression of type 1 collagen gene in the tibia as compared to untreated fluoride-exposed rats. It is concluded that T. indica fruit pulp extract has an ameliorative potential to protect the bone from fluoride induced collagen damage...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{mineral water}} {{contains}} minerals in various combinations and concentrations, which are dissolved {{in the water}} on its way through rock layers. In order to protect consumer health, the European Community will be determining maximum concentrations, which are to come into force uniformly in 2008. At present, existing maximum limits are under review and, if found to be necessary, maximum limits for additional substances will be proposed and established. This is currently under way for boron and fluoride. While there is no maximum limit for boron, the German regulation for mineral and drinking water (TrinkwV 2001) lays down 5 mg per litre for fluoride. High concentrations of boron can have negative effects on reproduction and foetal development in animals. An overdose of fluoride can, depending on age, primarily cause adverse effects of <b>skeletal</b> or dental <b>fluorosis.</b> The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has provided an Opinion on both elements and proposed upper intake levels. In order to protect all age groups, natural mineral waters should thus contain no more than 1. 5 mg boron {{and no more than}} 1 mg fluoride per litre. In its Opinion, EFSA assumes a daily intake of mineral water of 0. 5 to 2 litres per person and a high degree of brand loyalty. In its exposure scenarios for different age groups in the population, The exposure scenarios only take natural mineral water as source of boron and fluoride into account. EFSA relates the calculated exposure amounts to the “tolerable upper intake level (UL) ”. In regard to the EFSA Opinion on daily tolerable intake levels, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has reached the following conclusion: In order to estimate {{the degree to which the}} UL for boron and fluoride is reached in total, it is not enough to consider through natural mineral waters.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Fluoridation of {{community}} water {{supplies for the}} purpose of preventing dental caries remains one of the top 10 public health interventions of the last century. However, exposure (ingestion) of greater than optimal amounts of fluoride {{from a variety of sources}} has led to an increase in the prevalence of dental fluorosis. We propose that dental fluorosis represents a complex condition caused by environmental and genetic factors. Purpose: To assess the role of genetics in the pathogenesis of dental fluorosis using genetically separate inbred strains of mice. Methods: Twelve genealogically disparate strains of mice were treated with 0 ppm, 25 ppm, and 50 ppm of fluoride in their drinking water. Each mouse was given weekly dental fluorosis evaluations. After 60 days of treatment, femurs were collected for fluoride analysis. Mandibular incisors were isolated for quantitative light induced fluorescence (QLF) studies and fluoride analysis. Digital and 35 mm images were taken of all mouse incisors in order to apply and compare the Dean's Index and the modified Thylstrup and Fejerskov Index (TFI), both indices of dental <b>fluorosis.</b> <b>Skeletal</b> radiographs were taken on the euthanized mice and later examined for extra skeletal calcifications and other gross bony deformities. Results: Differences in dental fluorosis susceptibility/resistance were identified between the strains, ranging from mild, moderate, to severe dental fluorosis. Furthermore, we found clustering of strains into distinct phenotypic groups. The A/J mouse strain was highly susceptible, with a rapid onset and severe development of dental fluorosis compared with the other strains tested. The 129 P 3 /J mouse strain was least affected with negligible dental <b>fluorosis.</b> From the <b>skeletal</b> radiographs, no gross skeletal lesions or evidence of bone dysplasia were noted. Similar body burden of fluoride, as judged from analysis of mineralized tissues, was seen in all strains despite differences in their predispositions to develop dental fluorosis. Both the Dean's and TF indices are useful for classifying the stage or severity of fluorosis in mice, and there are advantages to the use of digital images over conventional 35 mm slide images. Both indices correlate well with the amount of fluoride exposure during amelogenesis; however, these indices are not promising indicators of fluoride burden during amelogenesis. Conclusions: QLF proved to be an innovative and useful tool for the quantification of dental fluorosis. Furthermore, these observations support the role of a genetic component in the pathogenesis of fluorosis...|$|R

30|$|Fluoride has dual {{effect on}} living system. While {{fluoride}} concentration greater than 1.5  mg/L leads to <b>skeletal</b> and dental <b>fluorosis,</b> concentration lower than 0.5  mg/L {{is responsible for}} tooth-decay since low level of fluoride helps to strengthen the enamel (Razbe et al. 2013). The permissible limit of fluoride in drinking water is 1.5  mg/L as set by World Health Organization (WHO 2006) {{and according to the}} report; about 260  million people consume fluoride-contaminated drinking water (2  L/adult/day) (Brindha and Elango 2011). Fluoride is usually present in the rock minerals as fluorspar, fluorapatite, mica, etc., (Mondal et al. 2013). In groundwater, high fluoride concentration generally occurs due to physical and geological structure of aquifers (Ganvir and Das 2011). The geochemistry of high fluoride in groundwater depends on low calcium concentration and alkaline condition (pH 7.6 – 8.6), which are favorable for dissolution of fluorite mineral from the host rocks (Weinstein and Davison 2004). In urban and rural areas of India, groundwater is a major source of drinking water. In West Bengal, a part of Bankura, Birbhum and Burdwan districts, are highly affected by fluoride contamination in groundwater (Bhaumik and Mondal, 2016). At present, the techniques used for removal of fluoride may be broadly divided into four categories, i.e., membrane-separation (Meenakshi and Maheshwari 2006), ion-exchange (Mohapatra et al. 2009), precipitation-coagulation (Habuda-Stanić et al. 2014) and adsorption (Chakrabarty and Sarma 2012; Karthikeyan and Llango 2007; Zhang et al. 2011). Membrane-based technologies are based on the use of membranes for separation of fluoride from its contaminated water. Electro-dialysis drives away the solutes by using anion-exchange membranes under the driving force of an electric field (Meenakshi and Maheshwari 2006). Ion-exchange can remove fluoride up to 95 % but this technique is very costly due to high cost of resin and post-treatment at low pH (Mohapatra et al. 2009). Nalgonda technique of fluoride removal is based on precipitation-coagulation. The following technique can remove only 18 – 33 % fluoride and the greater part of the fluoride is converted to aluminium fluoride complexes, which is a toxic compound (Habuda-Stanić et al. 2014). In contrast to these, adsorption process is economically effective and ultimate fate of many contaminants in aquatic environment (Bhatnagar et al. 2011). Adsorption is basically a mass transfer-driven process and the adsorbate is adsorbed on the surface of adsorbent due to affinity of the adsorbent surface for a particular substance. A number of adsorbents can be used to defluoridate water (Karthikeyan and Llango 2007; Zhang et al. 2011); however, due to good reactivity of calcium (Ca 2 +) and fluoride (F−), researches are now trending towards the impregnation of calcium on the adsorbent for enhancement of removal of fluoride from its contaminated water (Bhaumik et al. 2012; Hernández-Montoya et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2011).|$|R
