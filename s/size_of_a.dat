5|$|A bikini {{is usually}} a women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for the chest and underwear cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the groin in front and the buttocks in back. The <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design.|$|E
5|$|According to the PCBS {{census of}} 2007, Bani Zeid had a {{population}} of 5,515, of which 49% were males and 51% females. There were 1,176 housing units and the average <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> household was five family members. The town's principal clans are al-Rimawi, al-Barghouti, al-Shu'aibi, al-Ramahi and Mashaal, although {{there are also a}} number of smaller families. Today, there are three mosques in the town, the Bani Zeid Mosque, the Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Mosque and the Omar ibn al-Khattab Mosque.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches lay {{four to six}} bluish-white eggs, {{which are}} oval in shape and about , roughly the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> peanut.

The eggs are {{incubated}} by the female alone, though the male brings her food as she nests, and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year.|$|E

5|$|An {{examination}} of the hull showed that a piece of coral the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off. Surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother, this coral fragment had helped plug {{the hole in the}} hull and preserved the ship from sinking on the reef.|$|E
5|$|As {{the half}} eagle {{approximated}} the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{number of foreign}} gold coins, such as the British guinea and the French louis d'or, it was accepted readily in international commerce and was of a suitable value for many business transactions. DeSaussure {{is believed to have}} struck half eagles first for that reason, after consultation with bank officials. The eagle lacked such equivalents, was too high in value for many transactions, and rapidly became unpopular.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, the large cent (about the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> half dollar) being {{issued by the}} Mint was {{becoming}} both unpopular in commerce and expensive to coin. After experimenting with various sizes and compositions, the Mint decided on an alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel for a new, smaller cent. After the Mint produced patterns with an 1856 date and gave them to legislators and officials, Congress formally authorized the new piece in February 1857.|$|E

5|$|Divers are aquatic birds the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large duck, {{to which}} they are unrelated. They swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. They feed on fish and other aquatic animals.|$|E
5|$|Furry {{conventions}} {{started in}} mid-1986 with parties at popular science fiction conventions, such as Westercon and BayCon in the San Francisco Bay Area. Over time, these parties split off into conventions of their own, starting with ConFurence 0 in 1989.

40|$|The <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ERP project can be {{a useful}} {{measurement}} for predicting the effort needed to complete an ERP implementation project. Because this measurement does not exist, {{research is needed to}} find <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> variables which can define the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ERP implementation project. This paper shows 21 logical clusters of ERP implementation project activities as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> formal group session. The clusters are based on 405 ERP implementation project activities retrieved from literature. These clusters can be used in further research to find variables for defining the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ERP implementation project...|$|R

5|$|Halley {{may have}} been {{recorded}} as early as 467BC, but this is uncertain. A comet was recorded in ancient Greece between 468 and 466 BC; its timing, location, duration, and associated meteor shower all suggest it was Halley. According to Pliny the Elder, that same year a meteorite fell {{in the town of}} Aegospotami, in Thrace. He described it as brown in colour and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wagon load. Chinese chroniclers also mention a comet in that year.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, {{like the}} alkali metals, has one valence {{electron}} and reacts easily with the halogens, but the similarities end {{there because of}} the small <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bare proton H+ compared to the alkali metal cations. Its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration. It is sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar electronegativities or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, The Orcadian {{newspaper}} {{reported that a}} strange creature had been seen {{off the coast of}} Shapinsay.

Opinion on the creature's origin was divided, with some islanders believing it to be a sea serpent, while others opined that it was merely a large seal.|$|E

5|$|In {{automatic}} test pattern generation, finding cliques {{can help to}} bound the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> test set. In bioinformatics, clique-finding algorithms {{have been used to}} infer evolutionary trees, predict protein structures, and find closely interacting clusters of proteins. Listing the cliques in a dependency graph is an important step in the analysis of certain random processes. In mathematics, Keller's conjecture on face-to-face tiling of hypercubes was disproved by , who used a clique-finding algorithm on an associated graph to find a counterexample.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} this scheme to be accurate, the time step must {{be large enough}} to cause the curve to move by at least one pixel even at points of low curvature, but small enough to cause the radius of {{blurring}} to be less than the minimum radius of curvature. Therefore, the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pixel must be , small enough to allow a suitable intermediate time step to be chosen.|$|E

5|$|Johnson was {{exceptional}} {{because he}} played point guard despite being 6ft 9in (2.06m), a size reserved normally for frontcourt players.
