The AFV also drafted many of Diệm's speeches, making <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were analogies made between South Vietnam and various events in American history, {{so that he would}} make a good impression on the American public and decision-makers. For this purpose they employed the services of the political consultancy firm Harold Oram.|$|E

5|$|However, {{there are}} some {{complications}} which neither Wally nor the experienced Alisandros anticipates. This time, Varrick's CEO Rueben Massey feels <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is nothing wrong with}} Krayoxx. The drug works as advertised, it has no ill effects and is unjustly maligned; Varrick has first-rate experts with impeccable records willing to so testify. The Varrick CEO flies to Chicago and engages Nadine Karros, the Rogan Rothberg ace litigator, who asks for a $5 million non-refundable retainer and bills at $1,000 per hour - and those who can afford it consider her worth every penny. With Karros' help, Varrick sets a trap for the mass tort lawyers. This time Varrick will only pretend to negotiate – their true aim would be to have a jury completely vindicate Krayoxx and deny any kind of tort.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham {{suggests that}} a synod, or ecclesiastical conference to discuss church affairs and rules, was held at London {{during the early years}} of the mission, possibly shortly after 603. Boniface, an Anglo-Saxon native who became a missionary to the continental Saxons, mentions such a synod being held at London. Boniface says that the synod legislated on marriage, which he discussed with Pope Gregory III in 742. Higham argues that because Augustine had asked for clarifications on the subject of marriage from Gregory the Great, it is likely that he could have held a synod to deliberate on the issue. Nicholas Brooks, another historian, is not so <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was such a synod, but does not completely rule out the possibility. He suggests it might have been that Boniface was influenced by a recent reading of Bede's work.|$|E

25|$|The British {{recruited}} {{heavily from}} the 'martial races' for {{service in the}} colonial army. Sensing the inequalities and fierce loyalty to one's tribe or group of the diverse native peoples of the subcontinent, the British found opportunities {{to use it to}} their own great advantage. These already wide divides were a fertile breeding ground to inculcate pride in one's identity based on 'race'. This served the British in two ways. On the one hand it made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no repetition of the Indian rebellion of 1857 by ensuring there was no unity among the different subjects of the Raj. On the other hand, it encouraged a sense of competition among the different 'races'.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, the {{dictator}} general Jorge Ubico came to power, {{backed by the}} United States, and initiated {{one of the most}} brutally repressive governments in Central American history. Just as Estrada Cabrera had done during his government, Ubico created a widespread network of spies and informants and had large numbers of political opponents tortured and put to death. A wealthy aristocrat (with an estimated income of $215,000 per year in 1930s dollars) and a staunch anti-communist, he consistently sided with the United Fruit Company, Guatemalan landowners and urban elites in disputes with peasants. After the crash of the New York Stock Exchange in 1929, the peasant system established by Barrios in 1875 to jumpstart coffee production in the country was not good enough anymore, and Ubico was forced to implement a system of debt slavery and forced labor to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was enough labor available for the coffee plantations and that the UFCO workers were readily available.|$|E
25|$|Constantius died in 421, {{after only}} seven months as Augustus. He had been careful to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no {{successor}} in waiting, {{and his own}} children were far too young to take his place. Honorius was unable to control his own court {{and the death of}} Constantius initiated more than ten years of instability. Initially Galla Placidia sought Honorius's favour in the hope that her son might ultimately inherit. Other court interests managed to defeat her, and she fled with her children to the Eastern court in 422. Honorius himself died, shortly before his thirty-ninth birthday, in 423. After some months of intrigue, the patrician Castinus installed Joannes as Western Emperor, but the Eastern Roman government proclaimed the child Valentinian III instead, his mother Galla Placidia acting as regent during his minority. Joannes had few troops of his own. He sent Aetius to raise help from the Huns. An Eastern army landed in Italy, captured Joannes, cut his hand off, abused him in public, and killed him with most of his senior officials. Aetius returned, three days after Joannes' death, {{at the head of a}} substantial Hunnic army which made him the most powerful general in Italy. After some fighting, Placidia and Aetius came to an agreement; the Huns were paid off and sent home, while Aetius received the position of magister militum.|$|E

500|$|After {{development}} was finished, the team reflected {{that the fundamental}} part of a Super Mario game {{was to make the}} player think about how [...] "fun" [...] it was to play the game itself, rather than simply finishing it. To accomplish this, Koizumi made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were certain areas of the game which could be enjoyed by all types of people, including children. Shimizu added that Super Mario Galaxys ulterior motive was to have everybody [...] "gather around the TV", as he felt that a game starring Mario was not necessarily something which could be enjoyed by playing alone. The game was made to support six different save files – Shimizu liked the idea of one player looking at the progress of another player and seeing how they compared against their own. Iwata stated that when the first Super Mario game was released, there used to be [...] "many more" [...] people gathering around the television who would enjoy watching the gameplay experience. Iwata asserted that well-made video games were more enjoyable to spectate, and hoped that Super Mario Galaxys co-operative mode would tempt someone who does not usually play video games to join.|$|E

Fonda has defended her decision to travel to North Vietnam, and her {{radio broadcasts}}. During {{the course of her}} visit, Fonda visited American prisoners of war (POWs), and brought back messages from them to their families. When stories of torture of returning POWs were later being publicized by the Nixon administration, Fonda called the returning POWs [...] "hypocrites and liars and pawns", adding about the prisoners she visited, [...] "These were not men who had been tortured. These were not men who had been starved. These were not men who had been brainwashed." [...] In addition, Fonda told The New York Times in 1973, [...] "I'm quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were incidents of torture... but the pilots who were saying it was the policy of the Vietnamese and that it was systematic, I believe that's a lie." [...] Her visits to the POW camp led to persistent and exaggerated rumors which were repeated widely in the press and continued to circulate on the Internet decades later. Fonda, as well as the named POWs, have personally denied the rumors, and subsequent interviews with the POWs showed these rumored allegations to be false as the persons named had never met Fonda.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the king}} had {{declared}} the German commission unlawful, {{it became clear that}} he would never be won over. An impatient Hitler appointed a German, Josef Terboven, as the new Norwegian Reichskommissar, or Governor-General, on 24 April, reporting directly to him. Despite Hitler's assurances, Terboven wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be no room in the government for the Nasjonal Samling nor its leader Quisling, with whom he did not get along. Terboven eventually accepted a certain Nasjonal Samling presence in the government during June, but remained unconvinced about Quisling. As a result, on 25 June, Terboven forced Quisling to step down as leader of the Nasjonal Samling and take a temporary leave of absence in Germany. Quisling remained there until 20 August, while Rosenberg and Admiral Erich Raeder, whom he had met on his earlier visit to Berlin, negotiated on his behalf. In the end, Quisling returned [...] "in triumph," [...] having won Hitler over in a meeting on 16 August. The Reichskommissar would now have to accommodate Quisling as leader of the government, then allow him to rebuild the Nasjonal Samling and bring more of his men into the cabinet. Terboven complied and addressed the Norwegian people in a radio broadcast in which he asserted that the Nasjonal Samling would be the only political party allowed.|$|E
