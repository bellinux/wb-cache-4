50|$|The {{formation}} of mist, as of other suspensions, is greatly {{aided by the}} presence of nucleation sites on which the <b>suspended</b> <b>water</b> phase can congeal. Thus even such unusual sources as small particulates from volcanic eruptions, releases of strongly polar gases, and even the magnetospheric ions associated with polar lights can in right conditions trigger the {{formation of}} mist.|$|E

50|$|The most {{vigorous}} boiling in {{a locomotive}} boiler takes place around the hottest part, the firebox. This was a drawback to the haycock arrangement, {{and led to}} the general adoption of the separate dome instead. The dome is placed forward of the firebox, in an area of less vigorous boiling and thus fewer <b>suspended</b> <b>water</b> droplets.|$|E

On November 15, Songyuan, Jilin, stopped using water from Songhua River.

50|$|Football pitch {{technology}} has moved forward tremendously since the 1970s/1980s, {{when it was}} found that by December almost all pitches were turned into mud baths. Today's technology includes the use of drainage pipe at 5m centres, a gravel raft, a sand (<b>suspended</b> <b>water</b> table) rooting zone, undersoil heating and supplementary lighting on the surface that encourages growth. Management techniques have also advanced, with more emphasis on soil and plant biology, morphology,and the zoology and physiology being introduced into the management of a grass sward. There are also a number of materials and methods to reinforce a natural grass playing surface.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} methods for {{detecting}} water in jet fuel. A visual check may detect {{high concentrations of}} <b>suspended</b> <b>water,</b> as this will cause the fuel to become hazy in appearance. An industry standard chemical test {{for the detection of}} free water in jet fuel uses a water-sensitive filter pad that turns green if the fuel exceeds the specification limit of 30 ppm (parts per million) free water. A critical test to rate the ability of jet fuel to release emulsified water when passed through coalescing filters is ASTM standard D3948 Standard Test Method for Determining Water Separation Characteristics of Aviation Turbine Fuels by Portable Separometer.|$|E

5000|$|A kreisel tank ("kreisel" [...] being German for [...] "spinning top" [...] or [...] "gyroscope") is an {{aquarium}} {{shaped like a}} horizontal cylinder {{that is designed to}} hold delicate animals such as jellyfish and newborn seahorses. These aquariums provide slow, circular water flow with a bare minimum of interior hardware to prevent the inhabitants from becoming injured by pumps or the tank itself. [...] The tank has no sharp angles around its sides and keeps the housed animals away from plumbing. Water moving into the tank gives a gentle flow that keeps the inhabitants <b>suspended.</b> <b>Water</b> leaves the tank through a screen which prevents animals from being drawn into the pump intake or overflow line.|$|E
50|$|Electrodynamic droplet {{deformation}} also {{of particular}} interest in crude oil processing as a method to improve the separation rate of water and salts from the bulk. In its unprocessed form, crude oil cannot be used directly in industrial processes because the presence of salts can corrode heat exchangers and distillation equipment. To avoid fouling due to these impurities {{it is necessary to}} first remove the salt, which is concentrated in <b>suspended</b> <b>water</b> droplets. Exposing batches of crude oil to both DC and AC high-voltage electric fields induces droplet deformation that ultimately causes the water droplets to coalesce into larger droplets. Droplet coalescence improves the separation rate of water from crude oil because the upward velocity of a sphere is proportional to the square of the sphere’s radius. This can be easily shown by considering gravitational force, buoyancy, and Stokes flow drag. It has been reported that increasing both the amplitude and frequency of the applied electric fields can significantly increases water separation up to 90%.|$|E
50|$|In a Stephensonian {{firetube}} locomotive boiler, this entails routing the {{saturated steam}} through small diameter pipes suspended inside large diameter firetubes {{putting them in}} contact with the hot gases exiting the firebox; the saturated steam flows backwards from the wet header towards the firebox, then forwards again to the dry header. Superheating only began to be generally adopted for locomotives around the year 1900 due to problems of overheating of and lubrication of the moving parts in the cylinders and steam chests.Many firetube boilers heat water until it boils, and then the steam is used at saturation temperature in other words the temperature of the boiling point of water at a given pressure (saturated steam); this still contains a large proportion of water in suspension. Saturated steam can and has been directly used by an engine, but as the <b>suspended</b> <b>water</b> cannot expand and do work and work implies temperature drop, much of the working fluid is wasted along with the fuel expended to produce it.|$|E

5000|$|The steam {{generator}} or boiler {{is an integral}} component of a steam engine when considered as a prime mover. However it needs be treated separately, as to some extent a variety of generator types can be combined {{with a variety of}} engine units. A boiler incorporates a firebox or furnace in order to burn the fuel and generate heat. The generated heat is transferred to water to make steam, the process of boiling. This produces saturated steam at a rate which can vary according to the pressure above the boiling water. The higher the furnace temperature, the faster the steam production. The saturated steam thus produced can then either be used immediately to produce power via a turbine and alternator, or else may be further superheated to a higher temperature; this notably reduces <b>suspended</b> <b>water</b> content making a given volume of steam produce more work and creates a greater temperature gradient, which helps reduce the potential to form condensation. Any remaining heat in the combustion gases can then either be evacuated or made to pass through an economiser, the role of which is to warm the feed water before it reaches the boiler.|$|E

We have demonstrated the feasibility of our method by observing the bead undergoing Brownian motion in water by implemented setup. For fast determination, a series of transverse intensity images are numerically reconstructed from a single hologram of the bead, then centroid technique is applied to the reconstructed images for enhancing the position resolution. Nano-meter scale resolution with a frame rate of 30 is achieved in this experiment in both lateral and transverse direction...|$|E
40|$|A {{standard}} undergraduate mechanics problem {{involves a}} raindrop which grows in size as it falls through a mist of <b>suspended</b> <b>water</b> droplets.

Here we show that air drag overwhelms mist drag, producing drop accelerations of order 10 - 3 g. Analytical solutions are facilitated by a new empirical form of the air drag coefficient C = 12 R- 1 / 2, which agrees with experimental data on liquid drops in the Reynolds-number range 103 ̆cR 3 ̆c 1000 relevant to precipitating spherical drops.

The filamentous form was neither restricted to any particular growth stage nor dependent on cultural conditions. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene revealed that this isolate {{was a member of}} the genus Bacillus, with no close relatives at the species level (sequence similarity T 95 < 3 %).
