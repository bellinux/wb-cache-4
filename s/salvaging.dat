5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed.

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of salvage: {{contract}} <b>salvage</b> and pure <b>salvage,</b> which is sometimes referred to as [...] "merit salvage". In contract <b>salvage</b> the owner of the property and salvor enter into a <b>salvage</b> contract prior to the commencement of <b>salvage</b> operations and the amount that the salvor is paid is determined by the contract.

40|$|Many {{scholars}} {{argue that}} international maritime <b>salvage</b> law, and particularly American <b>salvage</b> law, not only does little to encourage 2 ̆ 2 pure 2 ̆ 2 life <b>salvage</b> on the high seas, but outright discourages the rescue of human life. Conversely, this author takes a novel stance - not only does current international <b>salvage</b> law promote pure life <b>salvage</b> through its tenets and compensation scheme, but American <b>salvage</b> law, on its face and as applied, violates international law binding upon America. Part I of this comment discusses current international <b>salvage</b> law - its inception, its purposes and its results. Part II places American life <b>salvage</b> law into a global setting, correlating American <b>salvage</b> law with the international <b>salvage</b> law that binds the United States. Part Ill analyzes the topic of compensation for life <b>salvage</b> - the mechanisms in place both domestically and internationally, {{as well as the}} principles discouraging life <b>salvage.</b> Part IV takes a look at current issues presented by international life <b>salvage.</b> Finally, this comment ends with the conclusion that international law is already in place to promote and adequately provide compensation for life <b>salvage.</b> Further, this comment will offer numerous solutions providing for the enforcement of such international law, both domestically and within the global community...|$|R

2500|$|Pure <b>salvage</b> {{claims are}} divided into [...] "{{high-order}}" [...] and [...] "low-order" [...] <b>salvage.</b> In high-order <b>salvage,</b> the salvor exposes himself and his crew {{to the risk of}} injury and loss or damage to his equipment in order to <b>salvage</b> the property that is in peril. Examples of high-order <b>salvage</b> are boarding a sinking ship in heavy weather, boarding a ship which is on fire, raising a ship, plane, or other sunken property, or towing a ship which is in the surf away from the shore. Low-order <b>salvage</b> occurs where the salvor is exposed to little or no personal risk. Examples of low-order <b>salvage</b> include towing another vessel in calm seas, supplying a vessel with fuel, or pulling a vessel off a sand bar. Salvors performing high order <b>salvage</b> receive substantially greater <b>salvage</b> award than those performing low order <b>salvage.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAlthough primary {{treatment}} of localized prostate cancer provides excellent oncologic control, some men who chose radiotherapy experience {{a recurrence of}} disease. There is no consensus on the most appropriate management of these patients after radiotherapy failure. In this single-institution review, we compare our oncologic outcome and toxicity between <b>salvage</b> prostatectomy and cryotherapy treatments. MethodsFrom January 2004 to June 2013, a total of 23 <b>salvage</b> procedures were performed. Six of those patients underwent <b>salvage</b> prostatectomy while 17 underwent <b>salvage</b> cryotherapy by two high-volume fellowship-trained urologists. Patients being considered for <b>salvage</b> therapy had localized disease at presentation, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 10  years at recurrence, and a negative metastatic workup. Patients were followed to observe cancer progression and toxicity of treatment. ResultsPatients who underwent <b>salvage</b> cryotherapy were statistically older with {{a higher incidence of}} hypertension than our <b>salvage</b> prostatectomy cohort. With a mean follow up of 14. 1  months and 7. 2  months, the incidence of disease progression was 23. 5 % and 16. 7 % after <b>salvage</b> cryotherapy and prostatectomy, respectively. The overall complication rate was also 23. 5 % versus 16. 7 %, with the most frequent complication after <b>salvage</b> cryotherapy being urethral stricture and after <b>salvage</b> prostatectomy being severe urinary incontinence. There were no rectal injuries with <b>salvage</b> prostatectomy and one rectourethral fistula in the cohort after <b>salvage</b> cryotherapy. ConclusionWhile recurrences from primary radiotherapy for prostate cancer do occur, there is no consensus on its management. In our experience, <b>salvage</b> procedures were generally safe and effective. Both <b>salvage</b> cryotherapy and <b>salvage</b> prostatectomy allow for adequate cancer control with minimal toxicity...|$|R

After being refloated, she was ceded to France and used as a test ship for explosives before being broken up in 1926. Nürnberg was also beached by British sailors. She was eventually sunk off the Isle of Wight as a gunnery target. Königsberg was meanwhile stricken from the naval register on 20 July 1920 and ceded to France.

5|$|The {{region has}} two major factions within it – the Enclave and the Brotherhood of Steel, {{both of whom}} differ to their {{counterparts}} in the west.

5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and <b>salvaging</b> parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E
