40|$|Objective: To compare daily stride rate activity, daily {{exercise}} intensity, {{and heart}} rate intensity of stride rate in children with cerebral palsy with that of typically developing children. Methods: Forty-three children with cerebral palsy, walking without (Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) I and II) or with (GMFCS III) an aid and 27 typically developing children (age range 7 - 14 years) wore a Step Watch™ activity monitor and a heart rate monitor. Time spent and mean heart rate reserve at each <b>stride</b> rate activity <b>level</b> and time spent in each mean heart rate reserve zone was compared. Results: Daily stride rate activity was lower in children with cerebral palsy (39 %, 49 % and 79 % in GMFCS I, II and III, respectively) compared with typically developing children (p < 0. 05), while {{there were no differences}} in time spent at different mean heart rate reserve zones. Mean heart rate reserve at all <b>stride</b> rate activity <b>levels</b> was not different between typically developing children, GMFCS I and II, while mean heart rate reserve was higher for GFMCS III at stride rates < 30 strides/min (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: <b>Stride</b> rate activity <b>levels</b> reflect the effort of walking, in children with cerebral palsy who are walking without aids, similar to that of typically developing children, whereas children with cerebral palsy using walking aids show higher effort of walking. Despite a lower stride rate activity in cerebral palsy, daily exercise intensity seems comparable, indicating that the StepWatch™ monitor and the heart rate monitor measure different aspects of physical activity. © 2014 The Authors...|$|R

There have been attempts to extract certain gait features (e. g. step length, step frequency etc.) based on data recorded from handheld devices. However, these attempts have been mostly inspired from observations in biomechanics. Hence, there is a profound need to study the modeling of human walking gait cycle while {{taking into account the}} different device carrying modes. It is hypothesized that the presence of handheld device in one hand can alter the step level symmetry of human walking gait cycle without affecting the <b>stride</b> <b>level</b> symmetry. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a model of human walking gait cycle in different device carrying modes over a stride, which is based on parametric optimization technique used in robotics motion generation and the results of a preliminary experimentation conducted using motion capture technology. Both simulation and pilot experiments confirm that the presence of a small mass in one hand can affect the step level symmetry of the human walking gait which constitutes the novel outcome of this paper. Overall, the model successfully captures human walking features and can stand useful for the enhancement of existing pedestrian navigation algorithms with handheld devices for an increased autonomy of elderly people and pedestrian's mobility in general...|$|R

Blinding clouds of dust rolled up, and, driven forward by the breeze from the Atlantic, whirled about them. There were odd gleams of light, and a howling of dogs, as white-walled dwellings swept by, then only the clang of iron on lava, and creaking of the vehicle to break the silence of the desolate hillside, until the driver howled again as they clattered into old-world Laguna, just sinking into early sleep. The carriage lurched over the cobbles, sparks blazed up, white walls and glimmering lattices raced by, and Lilian glanced at her watch as, while the lathered team swung into swifter <b>stride</b> upon the <b>level,</b> Laguna receded into the night. Branches of eucalyptus met above, the road was checkered with shadow, but it was straight and good, and the driver evidently meant to win the guerdon promised him.|$|R
50|$|The French Trotter excels at both ridden {{and driven}} {{trotting}} races, and maintains a particularly balanced and <b>level</b> <b>stride.</b> Once its racing career is over it is extensively {{used as a}} remount for the Hunts (chasse à courre) in France where substance and economics {{are more important than}} equestrianism or turn-out. Its stamina, sure footing, excellent carrying abilities and even character makes it the choice mount for stag, boar and roedeer hunting, although thoroughbreds and Selle Français may also be in use. French Trotters can also make good show-jumpers and many champions have French Trotter blood. Jappeloup, the Seoul individual olympic gold-medallist was got by a French Trotter stallion.Since the 70's an over-production of French Trotters has sent prices down. Considering that 60% of a given production does not qualify for the races, many horses become available for amateur riders or riding centers. A reformed 3 year old trotter broken-in to harness and saddle may be bought today for less than 1200 €.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — While robot mapping {{has seen}} massive <b>strides</b> recently, higher <b>level</b> abstractions in map {{representation}} {{are still not}} widespread. Maps containing semantic concepts such as objects and labels are essential for many tasks in manmade environments {{as well as for}} human-robot interaction and map communication. In keeping with this aim, we present a model for places using objects as the basic unit of representation. Our model is a 3 D extension of the constellation object model, popular in computer vision, in which the objects are modeled by their appearance and shape. The 3 D location of each object is maintained in a coordinate frame local to the place. The individual object models are learned in a supervised manner using roughly segmented and labeled training images. Stereo range data is used to compute 3 D locations of the objects. We use the Swendsen-Wang algorithm, a cluster MCMC method, to solve the correspondence problem between image features and objects during inference. We provide a technique for building panoramic place models from multiple views of a location. An algorithm for place recognition by comparing models is also provided. Results are presented in the form of place models inferred in an indoor environment. We envision the use of our place model as a building block towards a complete object-based semantic mapping system. I...|$|R
40|$|Africana {{people in}} America have relied upon the {{utilization}} of political participation {{in order to address}} the economic and societal ills that plague its community. Africana people have made <b>strides</b> at all <b>levels</b> of the American government. Africana people were a vital voting block that helped to elect the first American President of African descent. However, {{studies have shown that the}} conditions of Africana people in America have not substantially changed since the Voting Rights Act of 1 965 was enacted. Africana political participation has not equated to socioeconomic equality on a large scale for the Africana community. Utilizing Feagin 2 ̆ 7 s Systemic Racism Theory, this project looks to examine why solely relying upon the American political system is symptomatic of disagency for Africana people and argues that this dis-agency does not empower our people to seek solutions. It places the power to liberate in the oppressor 2 ̆ 7 s hands, thus maintaining the inequality that continues to exist in America. This article also argues for Africana people to look to themselves as the avenue for addressing the societal ills that it faces. It also argues that Africana people must be their own mechanism for liberation. In addition, the terms Africana and Black will be used interchangeably in the project because those terms are most readily identifiable to people of African descent living in America...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis Animals must {{continually}} respond dynamically as {{they move}} through complex environments, and slopes are a common terrain on which legged animals must move. Despite this, non-level locomotion remains poorly understood. In this study, we first review the literature on locomotor mechanics, metabolic cost, and kinematic strategies on slopes. Using existing literature we then performed scaling analyses of kinematic variables, including speed, duty factor, and stride-length {{across a range of}} body sizes from ants to horses. The studies that examined locomotion on inclines vastly outnumbered those focusing on declines. On inclines, animals tend to reduce speed and increase duty factor, but a similar consensus {{could not be reached for}} declines. Remarkably, stride-length did not differ between locomotion on inclines and on level terrain, but this may have resulted from data only being available for low slopes (5308). On declines there appears to be a shift in locomotor strategy that is size-dependent. At masses 51 – 10 kg, animals tended to use shorter <b>strides</b> than on <b>level</b> terrain, and the opposite occurred at larger body masses. Therefore, possibly due to stability issues, body mass plays a significant role in the locomotor strategy used when traveling downhill. Although we currently lack sufficient data, differential leg function is likely to be critical for locomotion on slopes, with mechanical demands differing on limbs during movement on level, inclined, and declined surfaces. Our scaling analysis not only highlights areas that require future work, but also suggests that body size is important for determining the mechanics and strategies animals use to negotiate non-level terrain. It is clear that selection has resulted in an incredible range of body size amon...|$|R
40|$|Tracking {{activities}} during {{daily life and}} assessing movement parameters is essential for complementing the information gathered in confined environments such as clinical and physical activity laboratories {{for the assessment of}} mobility. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are used as to monitor the motion of human movement for prolonged periods of time and without space limitations. The focus in this study was to provide a robust, low-cost and an unobtrusive solution for evaluating human motion using a single IMU. First part of the study focused on monitoring and classification of the daily life activities. A simple method that analyses the variations in signal was developed to distinguish two types of activity intervals: active and inactive. Neural classifier was used to classify active intervals; the angle with respect to gravity was used to classify inactive intervals. Second part of the study focused on extraction of gait parameters using a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) attached to the pelvis. Two complementary methods were proposed for gait parameters estimation. First method was a wavelet based method developed for the estimation of gait events. Second method was developed for estimating step and <b>stride</b> length during <b>level</b> walking using the estimations of the previous method. A special integration algorithm was extended to operate on each gait cycle using a specially designed Kalman filter. The developed methods were also applied on various scenarios. Activity monitoring method was used in a PRIN’ 07 project to assess the mobility levels of individuals living in a urban area. The same method was applied on volleyball players to analyze the fitness levels of them by monitoring their daily life activities. The methods proposed in these studies provided a simple, unobtrusive and low-cost solution for monitoring and assessing activities outside of controlled environments. ...|$|R
40|$|Terrorism is {{a costly}} activity. Terrorists and {{terrorist}} organizations cannot operate without resources –––– financial and non-human. The present article {{sheds light on}} concepts, mechanisms, methods, means, efforts, measures and multiple dimensions associated with the broad subject of financing terrorism. Focus of attention is assigned on the relative contributions made by Saudi Arabia to control such financing. Financing of 9 / 11 attacks is cited as an illustrative example. 	In its preliminary discourse, the present article expounds on key issues of introductory nature –––– research objectives; research questions; research methodology; concept of terrorism; {{and the concept of}} financing terrorism. 	The concept of financing terrorism is dealt with candid precision. Finances are inevitable to terrorism, asserts the author. These are as indispensable to terrorism as is oxygen to the viable survival of human life. Essentially, both terrorists and terrorist organization need money to cover their expenses related to their avowed objectives –––– dissemination of their ideologies; launching terrorist targets and operations; articulating terrorist plans and strategies; advertisements; persuading public to join them; purchase of armaments, explosives and other supplies of weapons; training their recruits; catering; providing accommodations, transportation; and facilitating information-communication channels. Both kinds of sources –––– licit and illicit –––– are manipulated for funds raising and financial collection. Conspicuous example of licit sources are donations received from religious and charitable foundations. 	The next important question relates to the transfer of money from one point to another. This includes extra-territorial habitations as well. Even on this score, both legal and illegal channels are exploited under various fake names. 	Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has pioneered its endeavors to control the financing of terrorism. It is an active member of Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The latter is championing its <b>strides,</b> on Arab <b>level,</b> to counter the financing of terrorism. In addition, the Kingdom has promulgated many acts –––– legislative and executive –––– that tend to facilitate the countering of terrorism financing. Moreover, the Kingdom has made its contributions with its participations to the dynamics of many Meetings –––– regional or global –––– held periodically on the subject. During such participations, it has contributed in offering constructive recommendations. 	Last but certainly not the least, Saudi concern on countering terrorism financing is implicit in its Law on Money Laundering. According to this Law, money-laundering is prohibited. Terrorism financing, according to some of its clauses, fall in the spectrum...|$|R
