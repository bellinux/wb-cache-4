Univariate analysis showed that <b>HBV</b> <b>marker</b> prevalence was also higher among women with no education or only primary education, with a lower family income and whose families originated from the South Region of Brazil. Pregnant women not having positive <b>HBV</b> <b>markers</b> (anti-HBc, HBsAg or anti-HBs detected by ELISA) corresponded to 73. 7 % of the population studied, implying that HBV vaccination needs to be reinforced in Paraná State. The highest prevalence was found in three counties that received the largest number of families from Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, where most immigrants were of German or Italian ascendance.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{blood safety}} Brazil introduced screening for anti-HBc among blood donors in 1993. There was {{a decrease in}} the hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission, but this measure identified a great number of HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive donors. Surveillance policy determines that contacts of HBV carriers should be screened to <b>HBV</b> <b>markers,</b> but there is no recommendation about how to guide contacts of HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive donors. Aiming to evaluate whether the contacts of this group are at greater risk for HBV infection, a cross-sectional study was performed to compare prevalence of HBV infection between contacts of HBsAg-positive blood donors (group I) and contacts of HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive donors (group II). Contacts were submitted to a questionnaire and blood tests for <b>HBV</b> <b>markers.</b> In group I (n = 143), 53 (37. 1 %) were anti-HBc-positive and 11 (7. 7 %) were HBsAg-positive. In group II (n = 111), there were 9 and 0. 9 %, respectively. HBV exposure was associated with group I, sexual activity, blood transfusion, being one of the donor's parents, and living for more than ten years with the donor. Regarding the families as sample units, it was more common to find at least one member with <b>HBV</b> <b>markers</b> (p < 0. 05) among the families of group I compared to group II.

There were 31 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers (3 · 9 %), with a low rate of HBV e antigen positivity, and none with anti-hepatitis D virus. Subtypes ayw 3 and ayw 2 of HBsAg were predominant, suggesting that the immigrants carried HBV from their original region to the Amazon. Clustering of HBV infection within families was found. The association between <b>HBV</b> <b>markers</b> and having lived in a gold-miners' camp, even after adjusting for confounders, indicated that the gold-miners may play a role in HBV spread in areas of the Amazon where gold prospecting occurs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Serum {{hepatitis}} B virus (<b>HBV)</b> <b>markers</b> are {{the most}} important data for epidemiological screening and clinical diagnosis of HBV infection, especially in endemic areas. We compared the results of the Roche Modular Analytics E 170 assay, the Abbott Architect i 2000 assay, and an immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HBV surface antigen (anti-HBs), HBV e antigen (HBeAg), and anti-HBV e antigen (anti-HBe). A number of serum samples (264, 263, 224, and 202 for HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe, respectively) were studied. For samples giving discrepant results for HBeAg between methods, real-time PCR assays were performed. The concordance rates among the three methods were high for HBsAg (100 %) and HBeAg (94. 6), but low for anti-HBs (91. 6 %) and anti-HBe (82. 2 %). For anti-HBs, which could be measured quantitatively by the Modular E 170 and Architect i 2000 procedures, discrepant results were observed at low levels of anti-HBs. For anti-HBe, the positive rate was highest with Modular E 170 (60. 9 %) followed by the IRMA kit (54. 1 %) and Architect i 2000 (51. 0 %). This study shows substantial differences between the assay results by the three methods, which should be taken into account in determinations of serum <b>HBV</b> <b>markers...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{potential}} risk of anti-HBc-positive blood donors for post-transfusional hepatitis and to investigate whether other <b>HBV</b> serological <b>markers</b> are capable of identifying {{the presence of the}} virus, 1000 first-time blood donors were enrolled between June and July 1997. These donors were screened using routine Brazilian blood center tests (HIV 1 and 2, HTLV 1 and 2, Chagas disease, Syphilis, HCV, HBsAg, anti-HBc and ALT). The 120 (12 %) found to be anti-HBc-positive underwent further tests: HBe, anti-HBe, anti-HBs and HBV-DNA by PCR. Ten cases were HBsAg positive and all were HBV-DNA positive by PCR. Three HBsAg-negative donors were HBV-DNA-positive. Two HBV-DNA-positive donors were also anti-HBs-positive. All the HBV-positive donors had at least one <b>HBV</b> <b>marker</b> other than anti-HBc. Anti-HBc is an important cause of blood rejection. Testing for HBsAg alone is not fully protective and anti-HBc remains necessary as a screening test. The presence of anti-HBs is not always indicative of absence of the virus. The addition of other <b>HBV</b> serological <b>markers</b> could represent an alternative in predicting the presence of the virus when compared with PCR. It is recommended that other studies should be carried out to confirm this finding. KEY WORDS: Hepatitis B; Transfusion; Serological markers; HBV-DNA...|$|R
40|$|Few {{data are}} {{available}} in the literature concerning the efficacy of standard hysteroscope disinfection procedures to prevent hepatitis B transmission. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission during hysteroscopy among anti-HBc-seropositive women. Serum and hysteroscopic samples were collected from 62 women after diagnostic hysteroscopy. All samples were tested for serologic <b>HBV</b> <b>markers.</b> Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out to amplify regions C and S of the viral genome and only samples amplified by both pairs of primers were considered to be positive. Anti-HBc was repeatedly reactive in 48 (77 %) of 62 serum samples, and HBsAg was detected in 8 (13 %). At least one <b>HBV</b> serologic <b>marker</b> was found in 49 (79 %) samples. Only one sample was HBsAg positive and anti-HBc negative. HBV-DNA was detected by PCR in 7 serum samples but in only 3 hysteroscopi...|$|R
40|$|Both the {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) {{and cancer}} stem cells (CSCs) have been independently {{implicated in the}} pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, {{there have been no}} reports describing HBV infection within CSCs. In this report we describe HBV core (HBcAg) and HBx protein expression within CSCs associated with human HCC. <b>HBV</b> <b>markers</b> were also identified in nonmalignant stem cells present in adjacent nontumor tissue. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of HBV-induced HCC and are potentially relevant to the treatment of both HCC and chronic HBV...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of markers for hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{and the rate}} of compliance with HBV vaccination laws were investigated in a study at Padua University Medical School (Italy). Of 2, 361 students, 385 (16. 3 %) tested negative for antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen. When vaccination was actively offered to these students, there was a low rate of compliance (47. 0 % [181 students]) but a good rate of seroconversion (93. 1 % [95 of 102 students]). Screening for <b>HBV</b> <b>markers</b> appears to be crucial to efforts to increase rates of vaccination coverage...|$|R
