25|$|The {{basic concept}} of the mineral sizer {{is the use of}} two rotors with large teeth, on small {{diameter}} shafts, driven at a low speed by a direct high torque drive system. This design produces three major principles which all interact when breaking materials using sizer technology. The unique principles are the three-stage breaking action, the rotating <b>screen</b> <b>effect,</b> and the deep scroll tooth pattern.|$|E

The single reached the top ten on the charts in Hungary, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. It also peaked within the top forty on the charts in Australia, Austria, Germany, Ireland and Switzerland. Matthew Rolston directed the song's music video, which was filmed at Pinewood Studios, London. It features the green <b>screen</b> <b>effect</b> and magical settings for the video's environments. The Sugababes performed the song on their tours in support of Three, [...] (2006) and Change (2007).|$|E

40|$|The plasma <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> {{of dense}} quantum plasmas on H+ + H charge {{exchange}} and ionization cross sections are calculated by the classical trajectory Monte Carlo method. For charge exchange cross sections, {{it is found}} that the <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> reduce cross sections slightly in weak screening conditions. However, cross sections are reduced substantially in strong screening conditions. For ionization cross sections, with the increase of <b>screening</b> <b>effects,</b> cross sections for low energies increase more rapidly than those for high energies. When the <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> are strong enough, {{it is found that}} ionization cross sections decrease with the increase of incident H+ energy. In addition, the cross sections have been compared with those in weakly coupled plasmas. It is found that in weak screening conditions, plasma <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> in the two plasmas are approximately the same, while in strong <b>screening</b> conditions, <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> of dense quantum plasmas are stronger than those of weakly coupled plasmas.

40|$|Dynamics of He 2 + + H {{ionization}} {{in dense}} quantum plasmas (DQPs) {{has been studied}} by the classical trajectory Monte Carlo method. The interactions between charged particles have been described by the exponential cosine-screened Coulomb potential. It is found that ionization cross sections in plasma environments are obviously larger than those in plasma-free environments due to the <b>screening</b> <b>effects.</b> Cross sections for H+ also have been calculated for comparison. For H+, cross sections increase {{with the increase of}} <b>screening</b> <b>effects.</b> However, for He 2 +, cross sections begin to decrease in strong <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> at intermediate energies. Furthermore, He 2 + impact ionization cross sections in weakly coupled plasmas (WCPs) also have been calculated. The interactions have been described by the static screened Coulomb potential. It is found that when <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> are weak, cross sections in DQPs and WCPs are approximately the same. As <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> increase, cross sections in DQPs become larger than those in WCPs at high energies. However, when <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> are strong enough, cross sections in DQPs become smaller than those in WCPs at low and intermediate energies. </span...|$|R

The green <b>screen</b> <b>effect</b> was used to produce the video's scenes, which include clones of the group's members. Critics commended the video for its futuristic concept.

Rolston conceptualised a [...] "prism-like" [...] glass room with six sides and large glass walls, in which Steele was {{inspired}} to enhance it with effects including reflections and lights. The video was developed in magical settings, as STEELE VFX created [...] "glamorous virtual environments" [...] such as a sparkling glass room. Buchanan wore a bikini, covered in chains and spikes, for the video. She is featured in a blue room and has rainbow-coloured sparkles on her face. Buena, who is seen pole dancing in a green-coloured room, is shown controlling [...] "smoke elements" [...] with her hands.

Compared to its {{previous}} single, [...] "Make Her Say" [...] was less successful {{on the music}} charts, with its highest peak position being at number 18 on the Belgium Singles Chart. The music video for the track was directed by Nez Khammal and utilizes a split <b>screen</b> <b>effect</b> {{to create the illusion}} that the three artists (Cudi, Kanye West and Common) were all filmed in the same location. In reality, they had shot their individual scenes on opposite coasts of the United States; Common and Cudi were filmed in New York City while West was filmed in Los Angeles. The third and last single to be released from Man on the Moon: The End of Day was [...] "Pursuit of Happiness" [...] on January 25, 2010. [...] "Pursuit of Happiness" [...] managed to chart at number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100, with its highest peak position being at number 41 on the Australian Singles Chart.|$|E
40|$|A {{structured}} mixed phase {{consisting of}} quark and hadron phases is numerically studied with the Coulomb <b>screening</b> <b>effect</b> {{and the surface}} effect. We carefully introduced the Coulomb potential, so that a geometrical structure becomes mechanically unstable when the surface tension is large. Charge densities are largely rearranged by the <b>screening</b> <b>effect,</b> and thereby the equation of state shows the similar behavior to that given by the Maxwell construction. Therefore, although bulk calculations with the Gibbs conditions show that the mixed phase may exist in a wide density region, {{we can see it}} is restricted to a narrow density region by the surface effect and the Coulomb <b>screening</b> <b>effect.</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|With the {{increasing}} disapproval of Chávez in 2001 and constant confrontations with him, the Venezuelan media, which initially approved and supported Chávez (no it didn't), turned against him, which then accelerated his loss of popularity.

A few hours after the meeting, the first split screen cadena coverage occurred while covering a speech by the labor minister.

Major new system updates include proactivity, where Siri and advanced search are combined to make the operating system more contextually aware of information (such as time and location), and can provide the user with information ahead of time. For searching, the proactive intelligence can display instant results in a widget-like format, including weather, sports, news, and more. iOS 9 also added multiple forms of multitasking to the iPad. In iOS 9.3, Apple added a Night Shift mode that changes the color of the device's display to a warmer, less [...] "blue light" [...] shade, to prevent any potential negative <b>screen</b> <b>effect</b> on users' circadian rhythms. Additionally, iOS 9 brought new user experience functions, including Quick Actions, and Peek and Pop, based on the touch-sensitive display technology in the iPhone 6S.

40|$|When using optimal linear {{prediction}} {{to interpolate}} point observations of a mean square continuous stationary spatial process, one often {{finds that the}} interpolant mostly depends on those observations located nearest to the predictand. This phenomenon is called the <b>screening</b> <b>effect.</b> However, there are situations in which a <b>screening</b> <b>effect</b> does not hold in a reasonable asymptotic sense, and theoretical support for the <b>screening</b> <b>effect</b> is limited to some rather specialized settings for the observation locations. This paper explores conditions on the observation locations and the process model under which an asymptotic <b>screening</b> <b>effect</b> holds. A series of examples shows the difficulty in formulating a general result, especially for processes with different degrees of smoothness in different directions, which can naturally occur for spatial-temporal processes. These examples lead to a general conjecture and two special cases of this conjecture are proven. The key condition on the process is that its spectral density should change slowly at high frequencies. Models not satisfying this condition of slow high-frequency change should be used with caution.
