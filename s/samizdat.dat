5|$|During {{the trial}} in January 1972 Bukovsky was accused of slandering Soviet psychiatry, {{contacts}} with foreign journalists, and the possession and distribution of <b>samizdat.</b> On this occasion he again used his final words to the court to reach a much wider audience when the text circulated in <b>samizdat.</b> He was sentenced {{to two years in}} prison, five in a labour camp, and five more in internal exile.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Viktor Nekipelov {{published}} in <b>samizdat</b> his book Institute of Fools: Notes on the Serbsky Institute documenting his personal experiences during two months' examination at the Serbsky Institute in Moscow. In 1980, {{the book was}} translated and {{published in}} English. The book {{was first published in}} Russia in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In September 1960 Bukovsky entered Moscow University {{to study}} biology. There {{he and some}} friends decided to revive the {{informal}} Mayakovsky Square poetry readings which began after a statue to the poet was unveiled in central Moscow in 1958. They made contact with earlier participants of the readings such as Vladimir Osipov, the editor of Boomerang (1960), and Yuri Galanskov who issued the Phoenix (1961), two examples of literary <b>samizdat.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "Many {{dogs and}} one dog", {{a short story}} written in a surreal style, was {{published}} in 1979 in <b>Samizdat's</b> Metropol Almanac. She assisted {{in the creation of}} Metropol. She wrote essays about Alexander Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to dissident articles, many popular books were banned and subsequently distributed as <b>samizdats.</b> Some {{of the most}} famous works include George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four and J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, both of which are held at the Libri Prohibiti.|$|R
50|$|<b>Samizdats</b> detractors {{also point}} to the fact that AdTI has been funded {{directly}} since 1999 by Microsoft, a company which publishes the competing proprietary operating system Microsoft Windows, and considers Linux one of its most important competitors (see Halloween documents#Documents I and II).|$|R
5|$|In June 1962, {{food prices}} were raised, {{particularly}} on meat and butter (by 25–30%). This caused public discontent. In the southern Russian city of Novocherkassk (Rostov Region) this discontent escalated to a strike and a {{revolt against the}} authorities. The revolt was put down by the military. According to Soviet official accounts, 22 {{people were killed and}} 87 wounded. In addition, 116 demonstrators were convicted of involvement and seven of them executed. Information about the revolt was completely suppressed in the USSR, but spread through <b>Samizdat</b> and damaged Khrushchev's reputation in the West.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1967 {{at his own}} trial Bukovsky {{used his}} final words to attack the regime's failure to respect the law or follow legal procedures. He invoked Article 125 of the (still current) 1936 Soviet Constitution to defend the right to {{organize}} demonstrations and other public protests. He further suggested that the prosecution had repeatedly failed to observe the revised 1961 Code of Criminal Procedure in its conduct of the case. Bukovsky's final words in court circulated widely in a <b>samizdat</b> collection of such addresses {{and as part of}} a collection of materials about the demonstration and subsequent trials compiled by Pavel Litvinov.|$|E
25|$|Predominantly Baptist, Orthodox, Pentecostalist, Catholic, and Adventist groups {{authored}} religious <b>samizdat</b> texts. Though {{a diversity}} of religious <b>samizdat</b> circulated, including three Buddhist texts, no known Islamic <b>samizdat</b> texts exist. The lack of Islamic <b>samizdat</b> appears incongruous with the large percentage of Muslims who resided in the USSR.|$|E
50|$|Alexandru Beldie died on June 4, 2003, some 3 {{years after}} the {{original}} book saw print, in what his colleagues describe as undeserved anonymity. Constantin's memoirs were enjoying the attention of literary critics, including Dan C. Mihăilescu, who reviewed them together with a mass of recovered <b>samizdats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Up until 1994, {{the country}} had a {{thriving}} Alternative press comprising community broadsheets, bilingual weeklies and even student [...] "zines" [...] and xeroxed <b>samizdats.</b> After the elections, funding and support for such ventures dried up, {{but there has been}} a resurgence of interest in alternative forms of news gathering of late, particularly since the events of 11 September 2001.|$|R
500|$|The Polish {{government}} enforced censorship, {{and official}} media said {{little about the}} [...] "sporadic labor disturbances in Gdańsk"; as a further precaution, all phone connections between the coast {{and the rest of}} Poland were soon cut. Nonetheless, the government failed to contain the information: a spreading wave of <b>samizdats</b> (...) , including Robotnik (The Worker), and grapevine gossip, along with Radio Free Europe broadcasts that penetrated the Iron Curtain, ensured that the ideas of the emerging Solidarity movement quickly spread.|$|R
25|$|<b>Samizdat</b> {{covered a}} large range of topics, mainly {{including}} literature and works focused on religion, nationality, and politics. The state censored {{a variety of}} materials such as detective novels, adventure stories, and science fiction in addition to dissident texts, resulting in the underground publication of <b>samizdat</b> covering {{a wide range of}} topics. Though most <b>samizdat</b> authors directed their works towards the intelligentsia, <b>samizdat</b> included lowbrow genres in addition to scholarly works.|$|E
25|$|<b>Samizdat</b> distinguishes itself {{not only}} by the ideas and debates which it helped spread to a wider audience, but also by its {{physical}} form. The hand-typed, often blurry and wrinkled pages with numerous typographical errors and nondescript covers helped to separate and elevate Russian <b>samizdat</b> from Western literature. The physical form of <b>samizdat</b> arose from a simple lack of resources and the necessity to be inconspicuous. In time dissidents in the USSR began to admire these qualities for their own sake, the ragged appearance of <b>samizdat</b> contrasting sharply with the smooth, well-produced appearance of texts passed by the censor's office for publication by the State. The form <b>samizdat</b> took gained precedence over the ideas it expressed, and became a potent symbol of the resourcefulness and rebellious spirit of the inhabitants of the Soviet Union. In effect, the physical form of <b>samizdat</b> itself elevated the reading of <b>samizdat</b> to a prized clandestine act.|$|E
25|$|Certain works {{published}} legally in the State-controlled {{media were}} practically {{impossible to find}} in bookshops and libraries and {{found their way into}} <b>samizdat.</b> The first full-length book to be distributed as <b>samizdat</b> was Boris Pasternak's 1957 novel Doctor Zhivago. Although the literary magazine Novy Mir had published ten poems from the book in 1954, a year later the full text was judged unsuitable for publication and entered <b>samizdat</b> circulation. The novel One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had a similar fate and was widely distributed via <b>samizdat.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1975 Bahro {{submitted}} {{his dissertation}} at the Technische Hochschule Leuna-Merseburg, which was evaluated favorably by three reviewers. The Stasi intervened, engineering two opposing reviews. His work on The Alternative was unhindered, but Bahro {{was convinced that}} he would be unable to disseminate his book to the GDR citizenry. In December 1976 he learned that one of his <b>samizdats</b> had fallen into Stasi hands, which prompted him to finish his work quickly. Intermediaries arranged a contract with Europäische Verlagsanstalt, a West German publisher. Swiss musicologist Harry Goldschmidt smuggled the finished manuscript into West Berlin, and copies of the manuscript reached individuals in the GDR by mail.|$|R
25|$|With {{the end of}} World War II and the {{imposition}} of a communist regime, the Slătineanus became victims of political persecution: Alexandru's grandson, Stroe-Constantin Slătineanu, spent some three years in communist prisons; the estate was nationalized in 1949, and the Cotroceni museum was confiscated a year later. The authorities eventually allowed the ailing Barbu Slătineanu to live on the premises, as curator of his and his father's collection. A devout Orthodox, he affiliated with the clandestine literary and religious circle presided upon by Vasile Voiculescu, and helped circulate Voiculescu's <b>samizdats.</b> Eventually arrested in 1958, he died a year later, during interrogation in Jilava prison. His widow, Alexandra, daughter of politician Alexandru Lahovary, donated the remainder of his papers to the state; she died in 1979.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{important}} differences of scale between Polish underground publishing and the <b>samizdats</b> of the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, {{and other countries}} in the Soviet Bloc. In the 1980s, at any given time there were around one hundred independent publishers in Poland who formed an exceptionally vibrant segment of the black market. Books were sold through underground distribution channels to paying customers, including subscribers. Among the few hundred regional periodicals, the [...] "Tygodnik Mazowsze" [...] weekly reached an average circulation of 60,000 - 80,000 copies, while some issues topped 100,000. The estimated production of books and thick journals can be put close to one thousand per year and more than one million copies. Other products on this market included audio cassettes, videocassettes, posters, postcards, calendars, stamps and buttons.|$|R
25|$|In {{opposition}} to both democratic and socialist <b>samizdat,</b> Slavophile <b>samizdat</b> grouped democracy and socialism together as Western ideals which were unsuited to the Eastern European mentality. Slavophile <b>samizdat</b> brought a nationalistic Russian perspective {{to the political}} debate and espoused the importance of cultural diversity and the uniqueness of Slavic cultures. <b>Samizdat</b> written from the Slavophile perspective attempted to unite the USSR under {{a vision of a}} shared glorious history of Russian autocracy and Orthodoxy. Consequently, the fact that the USSR encompassed a diverse range of nationalities and lacked a singular Russian history hindered the Slavophile movement. By espousing frequently racist and anti-Semitic views of Russian superiority through either purity of blood or the strength of the Russian Orthodoxy, the Slavophile movement in <b>samizdat</b> alienated readers and created divisions within the opposition.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of <b>samizdat</b> texts were politically focused. Most {{of the political}} texts were personal statements, appeals, protests, or information on arrests and trials. Other political <b>samizdat</b> included analyses of various crises within the USSR, and suggested alternatives to the government's handling of events. No unified political thought existed within samizdat; rather, authors debated {{from a variety of}} perspectives. <b>Samizdat</b> written from socialist, democratic and Slavophile perspectives dominated the debates.|$|E
25|$|In {{its early}} years, <b>samizdat</b> defined {{itself as a}} {{primarily}} literary phenomenon which included the distribution of poetry, classic unpublished Russian literature, and famous 20th century foreign literature. Literature {{played a key role}} in the existence of the <b>samizdat</b> phenomenon. For instance, the USSR's refusal to publish Boris Pasternak's epic novel, Doctor Zhivago, due to its focus on individual characters rather than the welfare of the state, led to the novel's subsequent underground publication. The fact that Doctor Zhivago contained no overt messages of dissidence highlighted the clumsiness of the state's censorship process, which caused a shift of readership away from state-published material. Likewise, the circulation of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's famous work detailing the horrors of the gulag system, The Gulag Archipelago, promoted a <b>samizdat</b> revival during the mid-1970s. However, because <b>samizdat</b> by definition placed itself in opposition to the state, <b>samizdat</b> works became increasingly focused on the state's violation of human rights, before shifting towards politics.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Brezhnev talked {{of the need}} to [...] "renew" [...] the party cadres, but {{according}} to Robert Service, his [...] "self-interest discouraged him from putting an end to the immobilism he detected. He did not want to risk alienating lower-level officialdom." [...] The Politburo saw the policy of stabilization as the only way to avoid returning to Joseph Stalin's purges and Khrushchev's re-organization of Party-Government institutions. Members acted in optimism, and believed a policy of stabilization would prove to the world, according to Robert Service, the [...] "superiority of communism". The Soviet leadership was not entirely opposed to reform, even if the reform movement had been weakened {{in the aftermath of the}} Prague Spring in the Czechoslovakia. The result was a period of overt stabilization at the heart of government, a policy which also had the effect of reducing cultural freedom: several dissident <b>samizdats</b> were shut down.|$|R
40|$|Dissertation thesis {{focuses on}} the ethical aspects of {{literary}} production of the Czech dissidents. Literature is viewed primarily {{as a means to}} legitimation; it works as a legitimizing or delegitimizing agent. A good example is the Czech dream-book by Ludvik Vaculik which shows how it is possible through the written word to (de) legitimize and to (de) mythologize themselves and others and what ethical issues such behavior brings. It works with concepts of the proliferative effect of fiction and the author's reputation as symbolic capital; postulation of the authenticity of the literary testimony; the theory of collective authorship; describing the process of silencing; and the concept of the last dictionary and the solidarity based on a revision of this dictionary. It seeks to contribute to a new approach to dissent by showing the (de) legitimizing efforts in the <b>samizdat's</b> literature and the literature about the dissent and thus to undermine the mainstream homogenization of this multifaceted phenomenon...|$|R

Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.|$|R
25|$|Within <b>samizdat,</b> several works {{focused on}} the {{possibility}} of a democratic political system. Democratic <b>samizdat</b> possessed a revolutionary nature because of its claim that a fundamental shift in political structure was necessary to reform the state, unlike socialists who hoped to work within the same basic political framework to achieve change. Despite the revolutionary nature of the democratic <b>samizdat</b> authors, most democrats advocated moderate strategies for change. Most democrats believed in an evolutionary approach to achieving democracy in the USSR, and focused on advancing their cause along open, public routes, rather than underground routes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Once again, I take {{advantage}} of the wonderfully liberal and tolerant mood Andrei Khrennikov sets at his yearly conferences by submitting a nonstandard paper for the proceedings. This pseudo-paper consists of excerpts drawn from two of my <b>samizdats</b> [Quantum States: What the Hell Are They? and Darwinism All the Way Down (and Probabilism All the Way Back Up) ] that I think best summarize what I am aiming for on the broadest scale with my quantum foundations program. Section 1 tries to draw a picture of a physical world whose essence is “Darwinism all the way down. ” Section 2 outlines how quantum theory should be viewed in light of that, i. e., as being an expression of probabilism (in Bruno de Finetti or Richard Jeffrey’s sense) all the way back up. Section 3 describes how the idea of “identical ” quantum measurement outcomes, though sounding atomistic in character, nonetheless meshes well with a William Jamesian style “radical pluralism. ” Sections 4 and 5 further detail how quantum theory should not be viewed so much as a “theory of the world, ” but rather as a theory of decision-making for agents immersed within a quantum world—that is, a world in continual creation. Finally, Sections 6 and 7 attempt to sketch once again the very positive sense in which quantum theory is incomplete, but still just as complete is it can be. In total, I hope these heady speculations convey some of the excitement and potential I see for the malleable world quantum mechanics hints of. ...|$|R
