5|$|Availability of {{substitute}} goods: The {{more and}} closer the <b>substitutes</b> available, {{the higher the}} elasticity is likely to be, as people can easily switch from one good to another if an even minor price change is made; There is a strong substitution effect. If no close <b>substitutes</b> are available, the substitution effect will be small and the demand inelastic.|$|E
5|$|Breadth of {{definition}} of a good: The broader the {{definition of a}} good (or service), the lower the elasticity. For example, Company X's fish and chips would tend to have a relatively high elasticity of demand if a significant number of <b>substitutes</b> are available, whereas food in general would have an extremely low elasticity of demand because no <b>substitutes</b> exist.|$|E
