5|$|The {{war effort}} {{was the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E

5000|$|After the 2006 {{election}} in which Republicans lost control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Representatives {{largely due to}} <b>the</b> unpopularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war in Iraq, Flake changed {{his position on the}} Iraq War to one of cautious opposition, including voting against appropriations. At a 2008 congressional hearing featuring General David Petraeus, Flake said, [...] "I still have a hard time seeing the big picture and what constitutes success Iraq. That's not just one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> with those kind of concerns. Many on this <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> have that as well." ...|$|R
5000|$|The liberal {{advocacy}} group People for the American Way criticized it for supporting a political documentary {{and as a}} cinematic selection by legislators rather than educators. Southwest Florida's television station WINK-TV reported that critics said the legislation was [...] "propaganda and ignorant". <b>The</b> head <b>of</b> Collier County's local Libertarian Party, Jared Grifoni, did not contest the content but the attempted requirement, [...] "We should be working {{to get rid of}} political and social engineering in schools regardless which <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> is pushing it.

25|$|Strauss {{recommended}} former Senator Howard Baker, a Republican who was respected on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> for his {{competence and}} his integrity. Reagan was visibly annoyed with Strauss's suggestions, {{but a few}} days later, Donald Regan submitted his resignation, and the President appointed Baker to replace him. Baker skillfully managed Reagan's recovery from the controversy, and Reagan left office with his popularity restored.|$|E
25|$|On July 15, 1910 The National Assembly {{elected the}} 42‑year‑old Restrepo {{to assume the}} Presidency of Colombia. Restrepo had won the {{election}} with 23 votes in his favor against 18 votes for his contender José Vicente Concha. He became the first Antioquian to be elected to preside over the country. His victory {{was a surprise to}} many who considered him just a journalist, and more surprisingly yet, was his victory on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> winning the majority on both parties.|$|E
25|$|Speaker Bolger {{has stated}} {{that he plans to}} work with legislators on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> to assist Detroit in its revitalization. In October 2013, the Speaker visited Detroit with state Representative Harvey Santana, a Democrat from Michigan's 9th house district, and pledged to explore ways to fight crime, lower auto {{insurance}} rates and clean up the city. After the visit Speaker Bolger met with the Michigan State Police to discuss alternatives to fighting crime, as well as discussing plans about alternative sentencing options with other legislators.|$|E

25|$|In 2005 Vitter {{introduced}} a resolution supporting prayer at school board meetings {{in response to}} an earlier district court decision that the Louisiana's Tangipahoa Parish practice of opening meetings with Christian prayers was unconstitutional. The bill died in committee after receiving little support from colleagues on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> Vitter later reintroduced the resolution in January 2007 after a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court concluded that Christian prayers were unconstitutional but was undecided whether nonsectarian prayers were allowed. In July 2007, the full Fifth Circuit dismissed the case {{because of a lack of}} standing. The school board subsequently resumed prayer evocations but opened it to diverse community religions. Vitter's bill died in committee.|$|E
25|$|During 1996, the {{original}} TranzAlpine observation car was thoroughly overhauled and air-conditioning installed, and this car, {{along with the}} two former Lynx Express cars and the car with luggage space, were permanently assigned to this train. The backpackers' car was later replaced by the only former Southerner (later Northerner) car to escape rebuilding as a panorama car or scrapping. It was fitted with 47 of {{the same type of}} Addington seat that it had had in the mid to late 1980s, all seats facing toward the two centre tables, one on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> of the car, and became the new backpackers' car. The former Connoisseur car, thoroughly refurbished the year before with air conditioning installed, assumed regular duty. The Lynx Express baggage van and later the first of the NIMT baggage vans were also allocated to this service. Later, the second backpacker car had air conditioning installed, and in late 2003, was transferred north for the Overlander or Wairarapa Connection'.|$|E
500|$|He {{has also}} lectured on areas of his {{expertise}} on Iraq since 2004 {{to assist in}} readying U.S. Army and National Guard contingents for their assignments in Iraq. In 2007, Carney returned to Iraq from February until June to serve as Coordinator for Economic Transition and was again with the State Department as Head of the Interagency Election Support Team in Kabul from March until November 2009. Throughout his long foreign service career, Carney advocated a policy of [...] "constructive engagement" [...] with rogue countries, often against policy prescriptions formulated by White House advisers in the administrations for whom he worked. Viewed {{as something of a}} maverick diplomat, he was often at odds with senior national security officials as well as political appointees on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> in Washington.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the cost of}} a new procurement program, industry officials stated that to merely extend the operating life of the current fleet is a risky choice because it is both less secure and costly to maintain. Lawmakers from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> including Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Representative Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD) have been outspoken critics of the Pentagon in the matter—Bartlett recently claiming that [...] "they had this conversation outside the partnership and we regret that." [...] Loren Thompson, an analyst for the Lexington Institute, stated [...] "I {{do not believe that the}} story of VH-71 is over... Secretary Gates has not made a convincing case for terminating the program, and there is no alternative helicopter that can satisfy range and payload requirements while still landing on the White House lawn." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire that appeared in early August 2016, Eastwood discussed Donald Trump and how this generation, as he put it, is a [...] "pussy generation." [...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's not so good. And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion {{on the fact that the}} guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He's said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he was a little bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> She's made a lot of dough out of being a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. I'm sure that Ronald Reagan gave up dough to be a politician." ...|$|E

2500|$|Coughlin's {{service to}} the members and staffs of the House have earned him praise from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> In 2010, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{described}} him by saying that [...] "He has seen us through the dark and through the bright," [...] and Representative Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) confessed to being [...] "a better person for having known Father Coughlin and having been counseled by him."

50|$|St Alban's is {{constructed}} in brick with stone dressings, and is roofed in clay tiles. Its plan {{consists of a}} nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, north and south transepts, a vestry, and a chancel. The clerestory has three-light windows, and there are four-light windows along <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b> <b>The</b> east window has five lights, and the west wall is blank. The south transept forms a continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> but <b>the</b> north transept is taller, it carries the bellcote, and has its own roof. The vestry has a pyramidal roof.|$|R
2500|$|In late 2015 c2c adapted 20% of {{carriages}} into a [...] "metro" [...] style.

This increased <b>the</b> passenger capacity <b>of</b> these carriages, at <b>the</b> expense <b>of</b> seating capacity, by converting <b>the</b> space <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> seat on <b>the</b> [...] "3" [...] side into (more efficient) standing space.|$|R
2500|$|DeLay {{was known}} to [...] "primary" [...] Republicans who {{resisted}} his votes (i.e., to threaten to endorse and to support a Republican primary challenge to the disobedient representative), and, {{like many of his}} predecessors in Congress, used promises of future committee chairmanships to bargain for support among the [...] members of the party. Employing a method known as [...] "catch and release", DeLay allowed centrist or moderately conservative Republicans to take turns voting against controversial bills. If a representative said that a bill was unpopular in his district, then DeLay would ask him to vote for it only if his vote were necessary for passage; if his vote were not needed, then the representative would be able to vote against the party without reprisal, a practice which has been followed by other party leaders and whips from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> Democrat and Republican, respectively, when in power.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his first}} term in the Senate, Laxalt was active in many {{legislative}} battles. [...] In 1977, he led the fight against President Carter's proposal to transfer the Panama Canal to the Panamanian government. Despite being in the minority in the Senate, Laxalt helped build a coalition opposed to the Panama Canal Treaties. Opponents successfully built a grassroots campaign designed {{to put pressure on}} the Senate. On the day of the vote, Laxalt was confident that {{he would be able to}} secure the 34 votes needed to defeat the treaties. However, his Nevada colleague Howard Cannon decided to support the treaties. Even in defeat, Laxalt had won plaudits from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> for the manner in which he led the opposition. Indeed, throughout his Senate tenure, Laxalt remained popular among his colleagues, principally because he was viewed as a [...] "straight shooter" [...] and someone who never allowed political differences to turn personal. He was good friends with conservative Senator Jesse Helms and liberal Senator Ted Kennedy. [...] (At the request of Sen. Kennedy, Laxalt arranged to have President Reagan present Ethel Kennedy with the original copy of the medal honoring her late husband Robert F. Kennedy.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Newt Gingrich, whose {{approval}} as Speaker, {{both in the}} Congress and in {{the public}} eye, had already greatly suffered due to his polarizing political style and a formal House reprimand and $300,000 fine for political ethics violations, was widely blamed for the political failure of impeachment and the House losses by Republicans in the 1998 midterms and during the 1996 general election as well. Facing the second major attempt in as many years by House Republicans, including DeLay, to oust him as Speaker, Gingrich announced he would resign from Congress. Following Gingrich's announcement, Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston of Louisiana became the presumptive Speaker-elect until December 1998, when, during House debate over its still-ongoing impeachment proceedings, he admitted to extramarital affairs himself and withdrew his name from consideration as Speaker. Armey {{was out of the}} running after fending off a bruising challenge to his majority leader's post from Steve Largent of Oklahoma, and DeLay, as the third-ranking House Republican, appeared to have the inside track to the Speakership. However DeLay decided that he would be [...] "too nuclear" [...] to lead the closely divided House that had resulted from the Republican House losses in 1996 and 1998. So instead DeLay proposed his chief vote-counter, Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert, as a compromise candidate, since Hastert had very good relations on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> As Congress reconvened in January 1999, Hastert was elected House Speaker, and DeLay was reelected House Majority Whip.|$|E
