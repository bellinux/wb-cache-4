5|$|The first church {{building}} was erected in 1886 in Oconto, Wisconsin, by local women who believed Christian Science had helped them. For {{a down payment}} of $2,000 and a mortgage of $8,763, the church purchased land in Falmouth Street, Boston, for the erection of a building. Eddy asked Augusta Stetson, a prominent Scientist, to establish a church in New York. By the end of 1886 Christian <b>Science</b> <b>teaching</b> institutes had sprung up around the United States.|$|E

25|$|Ida Freund (15 April 1863 – 15 May 1914) was {{the first}} woman to be a {{university}} chemistry lecturer in the United Kingdom. She is known for her influence on <b>science</b> <b>teaching,</b> particularly the teaching of women and girls. She wrote two key chemistry textbooks and invented the idea of baking periodic table cupcakes, as well as inventing a gas measuring tube which was named after her.|$|E
25|$|Wild {{was always}} keen {{to pass on}} his enthusiasm for science. With George Gamow and {{instigator}} Harry Messel, {{he was a member}} of the inaugural trio who, from 1962, brought high-level <b>science</b> <b>teaching</b> to senior secondary students throughout Australia. Titled Summer School of Science, the sessions were televised live at the University of Sydney and re-broadcast in three-hour programs early every Sunday morning – a fore-runner of the programs of today’s Professor Harry Messel International Science School.|$|E

LEED measures multiple dimensions of a building's design and construction including sustainable sites, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, water efficiency, and indoor environmental quality.|$|E
25|$|The Royal School of Mines was {{established}} by Sir Henry de la Beche in 1851, developing from the Museum of Economic Geology, a collection of minerals, maps and mining equipment. He created a school which laid the foundations for the teaching of science in the country, and which has its legacy today at Imperial. Prince Albert was a patron and supporter of the later developments in <b>science</b> <b>teaching,</b> {{which led to the}} Royal College of Chemistry becoming part of the Royal School of Mines, {{to the creation of the}} Royal College of Science and eventually to these institutions becoming part of his plan for South Kensington being an educational region.|$|E
25|$|The 125 of Hodge's {{time was}} a {{temporary}} peak - by 1905 numbers had fallen back to 66. Sargant's response to the obvious financial difficulties which accompanied this decline (there were just 80 boys in the school when he commenced his headmastership) was to apply in 1910 for Direct Grant status, and to become in effect the boys' grammar school for Rutland {{at the same time}} as continuing as a public school for the boarders. New facilities for <b>Science</b> <b>teaching</b> were created, boarding accommodation was improved with new building and extensions, and then a new school house was built. Pupil numbers rose again, to 105 in 1910, and to 200 in 1923.|$|E

30|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to show the utility of {{information}} and communication technologies (ICTs) in primary education teacher training. A series of experiences using these resources was produced and then undertaken by students to facilitate their learning of the curricular components of social <b>sciences</b> <b>teaching.</b> This practical exercise was implemented on the Didactic Methodology subject for social <b>sciences</b> <b>teaching,</b> offered on the Primary Education bachelor’s degree course. The experience shows how the students produced a WebQuest and developed the learning process for both the subject’s curricular content and competencies.|$|R
25|$|The Exploratorium also {{houses a}} number of other {{educational}} resources. These include the Learning Commons, a library and media resource center that houses a collection of print and digital <b>science</b> <b>teaching</b> resources for use by regional educators; a webcast studio, located in the Central Gallery, which produces 75 educational Webcasts from the museum and locations around the world annually, including a live webcast of the Mars Curiosity Rover launch and landing; and Lifelong Learning, which creates educational programming for children, teens, family groups, and adults. Lifelong Learning programs further the Exploratorium’s stated dedication to informal learning and the museum as teaching tool, and include day camps, workshops for families, the Homeschool Science series (in-house classes geared specifically towards homeschooled students), the Girl’s Science Institute (multi-day workshops geared towards girls 9-11), and excursions for adults. The Exploratorium has also published {{a number of}} books, and many of the 50,000 pages on its website are hands-on activity ideas or science experiments in the museums’ signature open-ended style.|$|E
500|$|The Corps of Cadets {{annually}} conducts the March to the Brazos, a [...] round-trip road {{march that}} serves as both a ceremony to transfer leadership {{as well as a}} fundraiser for the March of Dimes. The Corps hold various fundraisers and solicits donations throughout the year. On a Saturday morning, generally in April, each year, all members of the Corps gather at the Quadrangle, near their dormitories, and march en masse across campus and down Highway 60 to Texas A's Animal <b>Science</b> <b>Teaching,</b> Research & Extension Complex near the east bank of the Brazos River. There, the cadets learn who will fill each leadership position for the following year. [...] The current seniors are allowed to ride a bus back to campus while the newly promoted cadets lead their outfits back to campus. The event is the largest and most successful student-run fundraising event in the United States for the March of Dimes. In its first 27 years, from 1977 through 2003, the event raised a combined US$1.3 million.|$|E
