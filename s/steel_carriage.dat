50|$|Rubber {{linoleum}} {{was used}} as the floor covering, directly over the <b>steel</b> <b>carriage</b> underframe. This covered the entire floor surface, and met a rubber curbing along the sides of the hallways, placed over the wall coverings to protect from foot marks. Otherwise, the walls were sheeted with a veneer of selected Australian timbers; different timbers were used in the first and second class carriages, to match the colours of the seats. Toilets in each carriage had Terrazzo flooring applied, finely ground, then polished.|$|E
50|$|X15 was a {{test unit}} for a new {{generation}} of high-speed trains, leading to the development of the X2. The X15 consisted of three converted X5 carriages with new motors, bogies and tilting technology, as well as one streamlined corrugated stainless <b>steel</b> <b>carriage</b> that could be described as a prototype of a typical X2 carriage. It reached the contemporary Swedish speed record of 238 km/h. The three converted X5 carriages were scrapped in 1990, while the prototype X2 carriage was used as a measuring car for a number of years until it was scrapped in 2008.|$|E
50|$|From the 1960s {{the company}} {{specialised}} {{in the manufacture}} of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>carriages,</b> principally for the Portuguese Railways (CP). The stainless <b>steel</b> <b>carriages</b> were built at the company's factory in Amadora under licence from the Budd Company of the USA. During the years of the Salazar regime (the Estado Novo), Sorefame supplied the vast majority of Portugal's railway rolling stock (as well as for Portugal's then colonies), but the Carnation Revolution of 1974 and economic liberalisation, especially following Portugal's entry to the European Union in 1986, resulted in far greater international competition. Sorefame also assembled diesel and electric locomotives for CP (such as the Série 1900 in 1981), notably using components designed and supplied by the French company Alstom.|$|R
50|$|Operation {{of fixed}} {{carriage}} sets was not introduced until the 1980s {{and the introduction}} of the N type carriages. Before this time S cars could appear on various intrastate trains with other Z type <b>steel</b> <b>carriages,</b> as well as older wooden bodied stock.|$|R

50|$|Conversion of the Melbourne {{suburban}} {{system to}} electric operation commenced in 1919 and {{was completed by}} 1930, creating what was claimed {{at the time to}} be the world's largest electric suburban rail system. 1937 saw the introduction of the streamlined Spirit of Progress passenger train, with air conditioning and all <b>steel</b> <b>carriage</b> construction. Diesel power was introduced in 1951 with ten F-class diesel-electric shunting locomotives, followed by B-class mainline diesel-electric locomotives in 1952/53. A standard gauge line connecting to the New South Wales system was constructed in 1961 allowing through trains to operate between Melbourne and Sydney, Australia's two largest cities, for the first time. The last steam locomotive was withdrawn in 1972.|$|E
50|$|When the six {{standard}} gauge VFK cars {{were converted to}} broad gauge in the 1990's, they were given the code BZS to indicate that they were ex-Standard Gauge, with 64 seats matching the capacity of a typical BS <b>steel</b> <b>carriage.</b> Cars 271 and 275 {{were the first to}} transfer across, in 1990, and the other four were shifted in 1992 in preparation for the replacement of the Melbourne/Sydney Express with an XPT consist. Between 1995-1997 these six cars were refitted internally, with a larger door at one end and seats respaced, to provide sitting for 76 passengers and a parking space for one wheelchair. The new format was called BZN, and the cars were allocated to N sets.|$|E
50|$|Between 1936 and 1942, South Australian Railways built 36 <b>steel</b> <b>carriages</b> at its Islington Railway Workshops. All {{were painted}} cream and green being repainted maroon and {{silver in the}} 1960s. Aside from a few written off after accidents, all passed to Australian National in March 1978.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>steel</b> <b>{{carriages}}</b> had art-deco font [...] "VR" [...] logos added at the corners, {{as well as}} car-number holding plates; however {{these were}} not applied {{in time for the}} inaugural run.

50|$|In April 1948, {{air-conditioned}} HUB set {{rolling stock}} {{was introduced to}} the service replacing N type <b>steel</b> <b>carriages.</b> The Newcastle Flyer was the last express train in Australia to be worked by steam locomotives. This came to an end on 29 December 1970 when 3820 hauled the final steam powered service.|$|R
50|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the history of}} the 24 Corten steel vehicles with corrugated sides, constructed by the South Australian Railways and primarily used on the East-West Express from Adelaide to Port Pirie. The South Australian Railways broad gauge system had been extended north in 1937 to meet a southern extension from Port Augusta on the Commonwealth Railways' standard gauge system, creating Port Pirie as a break-of-gauge and transshipment point. To encourage passengers to use the line despite the inconvenience of changing trains, in 1947 the Cafeteria Car was constructed and used on the services to and from Adelaide, in conjunction with the mid-1930s <b>Steel</b> <b>carriage</b> fleet. In 1964 the first airconditioned sitting cars entered regular service on the East-West Express, and construction of those continued through to 1967 with a total of nine sitting cars and fourteen vans.|$|E
5000|$|MTV-82 is a [...] gauge high-floor four-axle tram. It {{has a full}} metal body {{which is}} mounted on a massive <b>steel</b> <b>carriage</b> with two double-axle bogies. The car has two double doors at each end, which have {{pneumatic}} gear for opening and closing. The main brake system is also pneumatic. MTV-82 is equipped with four 55 kW electric motors and is capable of a maximum speed of 55 km/h. The controller for motors uses direct current. Initially the MTV-82 {{did not have a}} low-voltage system, but this was added later for external braking and turn light signalization. The vehicle has 40 seats and is able to transport nearly 120 passengers with a full load. The MTV-82 is 13611 mm in length, 2550 mm in width, and nearly 3000 mm in height. The overall weight without passengers is 17.5 metric tons.|$|E
50|$|The LM-49 is a {{broad gauge}} (1524 mm or 60 inch) high-floor, four-axle tramcar. Its full-metal hull is mounted on a massive <b>steel</b> <b>carriage</b> with two double-axle bogies. The hull has three wide doors which have {{pneumatic}} gears for opening and closing. The main brake system is also pneumatic. The LM-49 is equipped with four 55 kW electric motors {{and is able to}} reach a top speed of 55 km/h. It utilizes a direct mechanical control of electric current to the motors. Initially LM-49s did not have a low-voltage subsystem, but one was added later for external brakes and turn light signals. The vehicle has 35 seats and is able to transport nearly 200 passengers at full capacity. The three main dimensions of LM-49 are 15000 mm length, 2550 mm width and 3085 mm height, with an overall weight without passengers of 19.5 metric tons.|$|E
