40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} mitigating the negative effect of vortex motion inside the <b>suction</b> <b>chambers</b> of centrifugal pumps {{in order to obtain}} better use of water resource and decrease the risk related to loss of prime. It was studied the influence of a rotating device on the vortex motion {{in the case of a}} vertical suction pipe. The device is consisting of three thin vertical cylinders symmetrically mounted on a horizontal rotating disk placed in front of the inlet section of the suction pipe. The experimental research was conducted for various diameters of the cylinders, water levels <b>in</b> the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> and pump flow rates. It was assessed the vortex type, frequency of arising and living life of vortices. The experimental results are compared with the case the device is absent in order to assess the efficiency of the solution. By using the device a decrease of about 12  15 % of vortex arising is observed for most of the water levels <b>in</b> the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> and for 80 - 90 % of the centrifugal pump flow rates. If high flow rates and low water level <b>in</b> the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> are simultaneously present, violent vortex motion is blocking the rotating device and the volume of air entered the pipe is massive - extreme regime. The flow pattern <b>in</b> the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> was visualized using a laser sheet. At the inlet section of the suction pipe one can observe two main flow patterns: central vortex entrance for high water level <b>in</b> the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> and reduce flow rates of the centrifugal pump and lateral vortex entrance for low water level and high flow rates. The conclusions of the experiment confirm the energy dissipation of the vortices arising <b>in</b> the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber,</b> due to utilization of the rotating device, in most of the centrifugal pump regimes...|$|R

The design of these machines, together with the accounting of flow losses and how to reduce them, is still based only on the simple analysis. Since Computational Fluid Mechanics offers today a more accurate estimation of the velocity, pressure, temperature and concentration fields within the screw compressor, such studies can be thus extended to design a suction port with the minimized flow losses.

40|$|Abstract — A {{tethered}} epicardial {{crawling robot}} known as HeartLander {{has been developed}} for minimally-invasive surgery on the beating heart. The crawler has been tested in vivo many times in a porcine model, a model which provides generally authentic conditions in many ways; however, the pigs tested generally have little epicardial fat, whereas the epicardial fat in human patients will be considerable. As a result, {{it is necessary to}} determine the effect of such fat on the performance of the crawler. In one experiment, using fresh ovine hearts ex vivo, clogging of the <b>suction</b> <b>chambers</b> of the crawler during sliding over tissue with active suction was investigated for a variety of thicknesses of epicardial fat. In a second experiment, the maximum traction force during each step was measured when sliding with active suction repeatedly over the same location for a variety of fat thicknesses.

30|$|Pressure {{fluctuation}} {{may cause}} high amplitude of vibration of double-suction centrifugal pumps, but {{the impact of}} impeller stagger angles is still not well understood. In this paper, pressure fluctuation experiments are carried out for five impeller configurations with different stagger angles by using the same test rig system. Results show that the stagger angles exert negligible effects {{on the characteristics of}} head and efficiency. The distributions of pressure fluctuations are relatively uniform along the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> wall, and the maximum pressure fluctuation amplitude is reached near the suction inlet tongue region. The pressure fluctuation characteristics are affected largely by impeller rotation, whose dominant frequencies include impeller rotation frequency and its harmonic frequencies, and half blade passage frequency. The stagger angle exerts a small effect on the pressure fluctuations <b>in</b> the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> while a great effect on the pressure fluctuation in volute casing, especially on the aspect of decreasing the amplitude on blade passage frequency. Among the tested cases, the distribution of pressure fluctuations in the volute becomes more uniform than the other impeller configurations and the level of pressure fluctuation may be reduced by up to 50 % when the impeller stagger angle is close to 24 ° or 36 °. The impeller structure pattern needs to be taken into consideration during the design period, and the halfway staggered impeller is strongly recommended.|$|R

The thesis deals with the appropriateness of the location of already existing small hydro power plant, which verifies the most important parameters influencing the production and the related profit.

There aren't any facilities on the stream that would allow continuous measurements of water level; therefore the flow duration curve is constructed on the basis of daily data operating small hydropower plant.

Thus, for the uniform flow of the viscous and heavy liquid in the entrance and going out sections of the domain, we must consider the two-dimensional special problems:- for the fluid entrance section we must solve a mixed Dirichlet-Neumann problem for a Poisson equation with unknown constant, depending of the slope angle of the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> bottom, which can be determinate by a successive calculus cycle of the computer program, satisfying a normalization condition, which for the given value of mean input velocity and entrance section dimensions ensure the desired flow-rate,- for the fluid going out pipe section we must solve a Dirichlet problem for an other Poisson’s equation, having the pressure drop gradient <b>in</b> the <b>suction</b> pipe as unknown constant, which can be determinate also by a successive calculus cycle satisfying a normalization condition, which establishes the pressure drop gradient on the pipe length for the same flowrate...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} devoted to the study of {{cavitation}} processes occurring in a gear pump with an external involute gear during the transportation of Newtonian fluids, determining the conditions for their appearance and studying the effect on their intensity of pump operating conditions in order to select the rational operating parameters of the equipment and improve the efficiency of the pump. For research purposes, an experimental booth designed for the study of hydraulic machines has been developed to measure the instantaneous values of pressure <b>in</b> the <b>suction</b> and inlet lines, as well as to conduct high-speed video recording of processes that occur 22 when using hydromachines. The video camera used in the study allows you to make up to 10, 000 frames per second, which made it possible to examine in detail the processes that occur during the pump operation. There was developed and created a physical model of a gear pump, and fluid flows in its internal channels were visualized, which allowed confirming the occurrence of cavitation in the trapped volume of a gear pump. The process is considered in detail and the places where cavitation phenomena appear in cavities of a gear pump are determined. As a result of rheological research, the rheological characteristics of the working fluid, HDZ 46 oils were obtained, it was determined that oils used as working fluids in the range of temperatures under consideration (+ 17 ?C [...] . + 50 ?C) behave like Newtonian fluids. A study was made of pressure pulsations in the pump lines, taking into account which a mathematical model was proposed for determining the velocity distribution along the pipeline section and the magnitude of the shear stresses. It was found that the velocities and shear stress in the flow that occurs under pressure that changes harmonically have a complicated form and varies over time. This should be taken into account in determining the hydraulic losses in the system. In the study of pressure pulsations, it was found that when changing the pressure <b>in</b> the <b>suction</b> line, the form of pressure pulsations in the injection line changes. Thus, at overpressure <b>in</b> the <b>suction</b> line pits appear in the ripple curve in comparison with the case when the pressure <b>in</b> the <b>suction</b> line is equal to the atmospheric pressure. And when pressure is reduced <b>in</b> the <b>suction</b> line to negative values, the curve of the pulsations of pressure is close to the pollen, with the gradual increase in pressure to the maximum value. The impact of the pump operating parameters on the intensity of cavitation phenomena that arise in the trapped volume during the operation was investigated. It was revealed that with increasing pressure <b>in</b> the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber,</b> the intensity of cavitation decreases. The intensity of the cavitation increases with the increase in the speed of gears and when the temperature of the working fluid increases, that is, when it decreases its viscosity. These studies allow you to develop recommendations for choosing pump parameters. The efficiency of the application of relief grooves was studied with the aim of reducing the intensity of cavitation phenomena. It has been found that existing grooves reduce the intensity of cavitation phenomena in the closed volume and <b>suction</b> <b>chamber,</b> but do not completely eliminate them. Based on the data of the visualization of the pump operation, a new shape of relief grooves is proposed, which enable to reduce the intensity of cavitation phenomena and provide, in comparison with the studied grooves, fewer leakages of the working fluid, increasing the efficiency of the pump. The method of influence on the intensity of cavitation phenomena by the influence of a magnetic field on a fluid pumped by a pump is proposed, in the case where the fluid is electrically conductive. Due to the action of the Lorentz forces, the extinction of vortices and cavitation phenomena occurs. ??????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????????, ???????????? ? ??????????? ?????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????????? ???????????? ?????????, ??????????? ??????? ?? ????????? ? ???????? ??????? ?? ?? ????????????? ??????? ??????? ?????? ? ????? ?????? ???????????? ???????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ????????? ????????????? ?????? ??????. ??????????? ? ??????? ?????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????? ? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ???????? ? ??? ?????????? ???????, ??? ????????? ??????????? ????????????? ????????? ? ????????? ?????? ???????????? ??????. ???????? ?????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ????? ????????? ????????????? ??????? ? ???????? ???????????? ??????. ????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ? ?????? ??????, ? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ?????????????? ?????? ??? ??????????? ????????????? ???????? ?? ??????? ???????????? ? ???????? ??????????? ??????????. ??????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ????? ???????? ????????????? ????????????? ???????. ?? ?????? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ??????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????...|$|R

40|$|The {{so-called}} stiction effect (or stiction force) {{is one of}} {{the sources}} of thermodynamic losses <b>in</b> compressor <b>suction</b> and discharge systems. The losses associated with the stiction effect are caused by a deformation of the lubricating oil film between the valve and the seat. This generates a delay in the valve opening, since larger pressure differencesbetween the cylinder and the discharge and/or <b>suction</b> <b>chambers</b> are needed to compensate for those effects. This paper advances a theoretical model for solving the dynamic behavior of a ring-shaped lubricant oil film between a discharge valve and the seat. The valve is allowed to move under the action of an external force due to the timedependent pressure difference between the cylinder and the discharge chamber. The main contributions of the model are the consideration of a finite amount of oil between the valve and the seat and mathematical relationships for calculating the initial condition for the oil film thickness. The model results are compared with those obtained with the Khalifa and Liu (1998) method. At conditions typical of discharge systems of domestic refrigeration compressors, viscous effects are the dominant component in the oil stiction force under dynamic conditions...|$|R

Modifications to the wing geometry that were advantageous for laminar flow usually introduced unacceptably large wave drag penalties: the most promising direction for future research therefore appears to be increasing the chord-wise extent of the suction control system. Nevertheless, extrapolating the predicted retrofit HLFC system performance to the entire wing upper surface, tailplane and fin would suggest a potential 6 ½ - 7 % reduction of total aircraft drag for the representative aircraft at cruise...|$|R
