5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. <b>Smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E

40|$|There {{is concern}} about the {{potentially}} increasing use of tobacco in Angola. However, information on the frequency and determinants of this use is not systematised. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of tobacco consumption and nicotine dependence among smokers in an Angolan population and considering individual socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics. A community-based survey with 2, 472 respondents (age range: 15 - 64 years) was conducted in 2013 - 2014 in the country's Bengo Province. The collection methodology for assessing each type of tobacco consumption and its daily quantification followed the World Health Organization STEPwise approach to chronic disease risk factor surveillance. The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence was also used to assess smokers. Mean values for prevalence of tobacco use and nicotine dependence were estimated by sex and by previously defined variables. Daily smoking (6. 1 %) {{was found to be}} higher for males (10. 0 %) them among females (2. 6 %), and the amount of ex-smokers (7. 5 %) was higher them smokers. Only 0. 2 % of those surveyed reported use of <b>smokeless</b> (chewing) <b>tobacco.</b> One-third of ever-smokers reported having started smoking daily before age 18. Nicotine dependence levels were classified as very low or low in 83. 6 % of the smokers. Daily smoking prevalence increased with age, and was higher in rural areas and among individuals with no formal education, lower incomes, and alcohol consumption. This population presented a low smoking prevalence, along with a low number of daily smoked cigarettes and low levels of nicotine dependency, despite the low prices of, and easy access to, manufactured cigarettes.

We used methods based in item response theory to identify and validate increasingly brief measures of ND that included symptoms to assess ND similarly among cigarette, cigar, <b>smokeless,</b> and poly <b>tobacco</b> users. ResultsConfirmatory factor analytic models supported a single, primary dimension underlying symptoms of ND across tobacco use groups.

40|$|Background: Seventy {{per cent}} of {{premature}} deaths among adults {{are due to}} behavioral patterns that emerge in adolescence, including smoking. Objective: The objective was to study the prevalence of tobacco use among adolescent students in South Delhi and its epidemiological correlates. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Setting: Three schools and two colleges of South Delhi were chosen. There were 550 adolescent students aged 14 - 19. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was done using proportions, the chi-square test, and multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 88 (16. 0 &#x 0025;) students reported having ever tried cigarette or bidi smoking. The prevalence of current smoking was 7. 1 &#x 0025;.

Subjects were recruited during 1991 – 1997 and then followed for approximately 5 – 6 years (1997 – 2003). During 774, 129 person-years of follow-up, 13, 261 deaths were observed. Tobacco use increased {{the risk of death}} across different categories of body mass, with particularly high risks being observed in extreme body mass categories. Among men, obese smokers and obese never users of tobacco were at 56 % and 34 % increased risks of death, respectively, compared with overweight never users of tobacco. Similarly, at highest risk were extremely thin males who smoked bidis (relative risk 3. 45) or cigarettes (relative risk 3. 32).

[...] Pipe smoking involves significant health risks, particularly oral cancer. Roughly half of periodontitis or inflammation around the teeth cases are attributed to current or former smoking. <b>Smokeless</b> <b>tobacco</b> causes gingival recession and white mucosal lesions. Up to 90% of periodontitis patients who are not helped by common modes of treatment are smokers.

40|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS) is {{the most}} common live-born birth defect in humans. The genetic cause of DS is trisomy of chromosome 21. 94 % of cases of DS trisomy are due to maternal chromosomal non-disjunction. Advanced maternal age has been identified as a key risk factor for DS. However, it is not clearly understood yet how maternal age effect increases chromosome non-disjunction. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} factors involved in meiotic chromosome segregation may be altered in aged oocytes and such molecular abnormality could be caused or accelerated by maternal environmental factors. Epidemiologic studies have tried to investigate effect of maternal environmental factors on DS. The most commonly-studied factors are maternal peri-conceptional smoking and oral contraceptive use. However, the evidence of association of those factors with DS has not been consistent. In this thesis, a DS cohort in Kolkata, India was investigated for studying association of maternal peri-conceptional behavioral factors on DS. The characteristics of exposure to two factors, <b>smokeless</b> chewing <b>tobacco</b> use (SCT) and oral contraceptive use (OC), are unique in this cohort as compared to previous study populations. In this population both exposures tend to be started early in life and in high dose. By using logistic and linear regression methods, I found significant association of maternal SCT and OC use with DS. SCT interacts with maternal age, having a stronger effect in younger mothers compared to older mothers, while the effect of OC use on risk is the same at all ages. SCT use is also associated with meiotic type (I vs. II) of chromosome non-disjunction and with lack of recombination in meiosis I type non-disjunction. Furthermore, maternal SCT use is strongly associated with maternal telomere length, which has been shown to be a molecular marker of aging. SCT use decreases maternal telomere length, especially among women bearing DS child with meiosis I type non-disjunction. In conclusion, with Indian DS cohort, this thesis was able to find evidence of interactions among three major risk factors in DS: tobacco use, oral contraceptive use, and maternal age. This study has great public health significance because better understanding of the risk factors for DS can lead to improved prevention and screening strategies...|$|R
