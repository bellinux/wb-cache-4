40|$|ABSTRACT Several studies {{addressing}} the inoculation of cereals with diazotrophic microorganisms {{can be found}} in the literature. However, in many experiments, investigators have overlooked the feasibility of applying these microorganisms to the furrow together with the seed, and the effect of bacterial concentration on phytostimulation. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of doses of an inoculant based on Azospirillum brasilense, applied to the <b>seed</b> <b>furrow</b> when planting maize, combined with different doses of nitrogen fertiliser. The experiment was carried out in the field, in soil of the cerrado region of Brazil. An experimental design of randomised blocks in bands was adopted, comprising nitrogen (40, 100, 200 and 300 kg ha- 1) and doses of an A. brasilense-based liquid inoculant applied to the <b>seed</b> <b>furrow</b> (0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mL ha- 1). The dose of 200 mL ha- 1 Azospirillum was noteworthy for grain production. This is the first report of the effective application of Azospirillum in the <b>seed</b> <b>furrow</b> when planting maize in the cerrado region of Brazil...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Water {{availability}} for {{cultivation of}} irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) is decreasing worldwide. Therefore, new technologies {{are needed to}} grow rice under aerobic conditions, {{in order to produce}} rice grains without yield losses and with lower water consumption. This study aimed at determining the best combination of management options for producing upland rice. A randomized blocks design, in a factorial scheme, was used. The treatments consisted of a combination of five rice cultivars (BRS Caçula, BRS Serra Dourada, BRS Primavera, BRS Sertaneja and BRS Esmeralda) with two compaction pressures in the <b>seed</b> <b>furrow</b> (25 kPa or 126 kPa), two types of seed treatment (with or without pesticide) and two types of N management (all at sowing or all at topdressing). Applying N at sowing instead of at topdressing produced higher grain yield in the no-tillage system (NTS). Under this system, upland rice genotypes show higher grain yield with higher compaction pressure. Seed treatment with pesticide provided greater grain yield for the BRS Sertaneja, in NTS, and for all genotypes in the conventional tillage system (CTS). BRS Esmeralda, in NTS, and BRS Esmeralda and BRS Primavera, in CTS, were the most productive genotypes. Moreover, in NTS, the application of N at sowing and the compaction pressure on the <b>seed</b> <b>furrow</b> are important for increasing upland rice grain yield. In CTS, seed treatment is important to improve upland rice grain yield...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus {{fixation}} {{in tropical}} soils may decrease under no-till. In this case, P fertilizer could be surface-spread, which would improve farm operations by decreasing the time spend in reloading the planter with fertilizers. In the long term, less soluble P sources could be viable. In this experiment, {{the effect of}} surface-broadcast P fertilization with both soluble and reactive phosphates on soil P forms and availability to soybean was studied with or without fertilization with soluble P in the planting furrow in a long-term experiment in which soybean was grown in rotation with Ruzigrass (Brachiaria ruziziensis). No P or 80 kg ha- 1 of P 2 O 5 {{in the form of}} triple superphosphate or Arad reactive rock phosphate was applied on the surface of a soil with variable P fertilization history. Soil samples were taken to a depth of 60 cm and soil P was fractionated. Soybean was grown with 0, 30, and 60 kg ha- 1 of P 2 O 5 in the form of triple phosphate applied in the <b>seed</b> <b>furrow.</b> Both fertilizers applied increased available P in the uppermost soil layers and the moderately labile organic and inorganic forms of P in the soil profile, probably as result of root decay. Soybean responded to phosphates applied on the soil surface or in the seed furrow; however, application of soluble P in the <b>seed</b> <b>furrow</b> should not be discarded. In tropical soils with a history of P fertilization, soluble P sources may be substituted for natural reactive phosphates broadcast on the surface.

40|$|Problem statement: Offset Double-Disk Opener (DDO) is {{a popular}} furrow opener in {{conservation}} tillage. It has some limitations such as negative suction to penetrate in the soil, hair pinning and mixing seed and fertilizer in the slot. Because of importance of separation of seed and fertilizer in the slot, by adding two horizontal mini disks to DDO a modified opener was made (MDO) which placed the fertilizer between and under two rows of seed. Approach: To consider performance of novel opener an indoor comparison test between DDO and MDO was performed at soil bin. The experiment was conducted with three working speeds (3, 6 and 8 km h - 1), two bulk densities of soil (1. 1 and 1. 4 Mg m - 3) and two levels of residues (1 and 2 ton ha - 1). The experimental design consisted in a (3 × 2 × 2) complete randomized factorial with three replicates for each test. Moisture of <b>seed</b> <b>furrow,</b> separation of seed and fertilizer, hair pinning and resultant forces acting on the openers were used as assessing indexes. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} between soil moisture content in slots created by DDO and MDO at 0 - 4 cm depth, but at 4 - 8 cm the in the slot created by MDO moisture content was higher about 9 %. Horizontal force for both openers increased with increasing speed and soil bulk density. Vertical force for DDO was negative so it needed additional weight for penetrating in the soil, but vertical force for MDO was positive and, which can solve the challenge of penetration in the soil in DDO. In soft soil with heavy residues some trash was pushed by DDO into <b>seed</b> <b>furrow</b> (hair pinning) but at MDO seed were placed at clean groove. Lateral and vertical separation of seed and fertilizer was performed effectively by MDO (4. 5 and 5 cm, respectively) while DDO put seed and fertilizer close to each other. Conclusion: Overall, the Modified Offset Double-disks (MDO) had better performance. So by adapting this opener with no-tillage drillers it would possible to have higher yield in conservation tillage where the most appropriate opener is disk type...|$|E

40|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>furrow</b> {{sidewall}} smearing by planter {{double disk}} openers in clay loam and loam soils {{was investigated in}} field and growth chamber experiments. Treatment variables were row preparation, soil moisture, and planting period. Evaluation parameters were soil bulk density, air permeability, cone index, emergence rate index and total emergence, and plant dry matter weight. The experiments were conducted in somewhat poorly drained soils near Ames, Iowa. The fields were not cultivated before planting and the residue {{from the previous year}} 2 ̆ 7 s corn was removed. Experiments were conducted in two cropping seasons. Each experiment consisted of a factorial design of three coulter treatments, three moisture ranges and three planting periods. Crop growing seasons were divided into three planting periods. Treatments were replicated three times using a split-split design. After planting in the field, undisturbed soil blocks were removed and transferred to growth chambers. Soil blocks were not watered and left for 28 days at 21 ° to see the plant shoot and root responses. Triple coulter produced lowest bulk density, lowest penetration resistance, and highest permeability in both the field and growth chamber experiments. In clay loam soil field experiments, the triple coulter seed placement was deeper and this treatment resulted in slower emergence and lower plant dry weight 42 days after planting than the other two row preparation treatments. In the growth chamber experiment, triple coulter had lower dry shoot weight and lower dry weight of roots in the furrow than the other two row treatments. In loam soil, triple coulter generally had faster emergence in cold and wet soil conditions and produced the highest plant dry matter weights 28 and 42 days after planting in the field experiment. In the growth chamber experiment, no significant differences among plant shoot and in-furrow root dry weights were observed for the three row treatments in loam soil. More roots were observed growing in no-coulter and single coulter seed furrows than in the triple coulter row treatment. <b>Seed</b> <b>furrow</b> sidewall smearing was greater, especially at higher soil moisture, in the no-coulter and single coulter treatment.

40|$|The Texas Blackland Prairie {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} agricultural regions in Texas. This region provides a long growing season coupled with soils that have a high water holding capacity. However, the soils also provide significant challenges to producers because the high water holding capacity is a product of a high clay percentage. This research was aimed to develop and test an expert-based trafficabililty index, based upon soil moisture, for planting cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) on the Texas Blackland Prairie. Testing the index focused on quantify the potential effect of high soil moisture at planting on <b>seed</b> <b>furrow</b> sidewall compaction and associated plant growth response. Once the trafficability index was developed, three workable soil moisture regimes were recreated in no-tillage and conventional tillage plots at the Stiles Farm Foundation in Thrall, Texas. The index nomenclature included: "Dry-Workable", "Optimal" and "Wet-Workable". After planting corn and cotton into conventional and no tillage plots, 0. 45 x 0. 20 x 0. 15 m intact soil blocks were removed from each plot and kept in a controlled environment. At 28 days, each block was destructively harvested to quantify plant root and shoot growth responses. Each of the three soil moisture indexes was replicated thrice per crop, and the whole experiment was replicated twice in time, n = 48 blocks. The trafficability index was created using three producer experts, and over 10 interviews to collect a range in soil moisture samples. From "Wet Workable" to "Dry Workable", the gravimetric soil moistures were 0. 17, 0. 22, and 0. 26 g g- 1. For corn and cotton, a positive relationship between plant growth factors and planting at soil moisture existed. Plants planted at the highest soil moisture emerged faster and developed more root and shoot biomass than those planted at the lowest soil moisture. No evidence of a detrimental plant response because of <b>seed</b> <b>furrow,</b> sidewall compaction from planting at too high a soil moisture content could be quantified. Furthermore, the cotton plants in no-tillage performed better than in conventional tillage, but corn performed better in conventional tillage.

As respostas aos tratamentos foram mais discrepantes inicialmente e tenderam à eqüidade com os cultivos sucessivos. Nas duas primeiras safras, as fontes de maior solubilidade (ST e TM) ocasionaram as maiores produções. Os fosfatos naturais (FR e FA) apresentaram aumento de eficiência com o tempo. A aplicação localizada do FR proporcionou alta produtividade na terceira safra. O {{residual}} de antigas adubações e as condições climáticas influenciaram os efeitos dos tratamentos. The {{objective of}} this study was to compare phosphate fertilizers in different methods of application during three successive maize cultivations in a Red Argisol (Hapludults) which had been previously fertilized. Treatments arranged in a 4 x 2 + 1 factorial design combined four P sources in the amount of 180 kg ha- 1 P 2 O 5 (triple superphosphate - TS, magnesium termophosphate - MT, Arad reactive rock phosphate - RP, and Araxá rock phosphate - AP), two application methods (broadcasted or banded in the <b>seeding</b> <b>furrow),</b> and a check plot (without P) as an additional treatment. The applied P ratio was based on the total P 2 O 5 content of each fertilizer. After the first cultivation, the soil was no longer revolved. Soil and leaf nutrient concentrations, and the grain yield were determined. The responses to treatments were more contrasting initially and tended to level off with successive cultivations. In the first two cultivations, the most soluble sources (TS and MT) promoted greater yields. The rock phosphates (RP and AP) presented increased efficiency with time. Banded application of RP provided a higher grain yield in the third cultivation. The residual effect of previous fertilizations and the climatic conditions influenced the effects of the treatments...|$|R
40|$|A {{manually}} operated two-row okra planter was evaluated for performance by conducting field and laboratory tests. The laboratory investigation included {{the determination of}} the variation in weight of seeds discharged from two hoppers, percentage damage of seeds, and average intra-row spacing of seeds. The field tests comprised the determination of effective field capacity, average depth of placement of <b>seeds</b> in the <b>furrows,</b> and mean spacing of seeds within each row. A percentage difference between the weights of seeds discharged from the two hoppers of 4. 97 % was obtained during testing; while the seed rate was 0. 36 kg/hr. A reduction in percentage damage of 3. 51 % was attained with spacing varying from 59 cm to 70 cm, and an average depth between 8 mm and 9 mm. The overall average efficiency of the planter was 71. 75 %...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: One of the {{limitations}} of liquid inoculation with rhizobia in the planting furrow in the dry bean crop is the small number of research studies involving this type of inoculation and the establishment of application rates suitable for good performance of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). Thus, the aims of this study were to evaluate the viability of liquid inoculation in the planting furrow in dry bean BRS Estilo and certify if the increase in the inoculation rate benefits its symbiosis with Rhizobium sp. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A field experiment was carried out in a no-till planting system in the 2014 / 2015 crop season in a Latossolo Vermelho distrófico in the south of Minas Gerais, Brazil, at 986 m altitude, 21 º 58 ’S latitude and 45 º 20 ’W longitude. The experimental design was randomized blocks with three replications and eight treatments, involving five application rates of liquid inoculant in the planting <b>furrow,</b> <b>seed</b> inoculation, and two controls without inoculation, one without N and the other fertilized with 80 kg ha- 1 of mineral N...|$|R
40|$|Two treatments, an {{integrated}} aflatoxin management package (IAMP) and normal farmers' practice were compared in Alfisol fields at ICRISAT, Patancheru, Andhra Pradesh, India during kharif 2001. The IAMP consisted of summer ploughing of the field, seed treatment with carbendazim (Bavistin 50 WP) at 4 g/kg <b>seed,</b> <b>furrow</b> application of Trichoderma harzianum at 50 g culture mixed in 50 kg FYM before sowing (to {{make a final}} population of 1 × 106 CFU/g soil), spray of Nimbucidin (250 ml in 50 litres water) and a second spray of carbendazim (50 g) plus Dithane M- 45 [mancozeb] (250 g) in 50 litres of water, if required, harvesting at 75 % maturity, drying by inverted windrows for 3 days, and removal of damaged and diseased pods. The farmers' practice was summer ploughing, harvesting at full maturity, drying by leaving them {{in the field and}} removal of damaged pods. No chemical treatments were involved. For both treatments A. flavus strain Af 11 - 4 inoculum was applied at 50 % flowering stage. Soil was sampled prior to sowing, before inoculum application and at harvest. Colonization of seeds by A. flavus was determined and aflatoxin contamination estimated by ELISA. Soil sample analysis showed unremitting growth of A. flavus in soils where farmers' practice was followed. Seed infection studies revealed predominance of A. flavus infection in plots under farmers' practice (10 %) compared with that under IAMP (2 %). No aflatoxin contamination was recorded in seed samples from plots subjected to either practice...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the kind}} of opener applied, no-tillage seeders can {{variously}} modify soil physical properties in relation to soil and climate conditions, thus potentially affecting crop emergence and early growth. The technological evolution of seeders for direct drilling of arable crops, progressively achieved in recent years, has been considerable, but new improvements now available need to be individually tested. In a field trial at Udine (NE Italy), the effects of a new kind of wide-sweep opener (i. e., side coulters curved upwards in their final part and slightly angled towards the direction of work) on soil physical properties in the seed zone and on crop emergence and early root growth of maize were evaluated in four different soils over a 2 -year period (2002 – 2003), in comparison with the widely used double-disk opener. With respect to the double-disk opener, in general the wide-sweep type led to higher soil–residue mixing—without excessive reduction of the soil-covering index being observed, �� 27 and �� 6 %, respectively. The wide-sweep opener also showed lower bulk density and soil penetration resistance in the top 5 -cm soil layer of the <b>seed</b> <b>furrow,</b> although no greater root length density was found in maize at the three-leaf stage, probably due to the smoothing effect caused by the side coulters at the seeding depth. A certain delay in plant emergence in some cases was also revealed for the wide-sweep opener, which {{may be related to the}} lower soil/seed contact. Deviations from this general behaviour in the various soils (texture and initial conditions) are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Three {{strains of}} Bradyrhizobium japonicum, I 17, 110, and 61 A 76, were {{evaluated}} {{for their ability}} to form nodules on field-grown soybeans in soil with a highly competitive indigenous B. japonicum population. The predominant indigenous strain, 0336, in the field site used was unlike the more common isolates from Midwestern soils which belong to the 123 or 138 serogroups. This strain persisted in the soil for at least 30 years without any soybean crops. The three inoculant strains differed in their ability to compete with indigenous strains for nodule formation. Four different inoculation treatments were tested in three adjacent fields. When the amount of inoculum was increased, a higher proportion of nodules contained the inoculant strain. The most competitive inoculant strain was I 17, a recent field isolate. Strain 61 A 76 was better than 110. There was no difference in recovery of the inoculant strains on the Hodgson or Corsoy soybean cultivars, nor was there a difference in recovery of the inoculant strains during the growing season. The vertical distribution of nodules containing the inoculant strains was affected by the method of adding the inoculant to the soil. Inoculant added to the <b>seed</b> <b>furrow</b> produced nodules mainly in the top region of the soybean root. Inoculant tilled into the soil produced nodules primarily in the bottom part of the root. The nodules that were produced in the bottom part of the root are younger and may contribute significant amounts of fixed nitrogen to the soybean during seed formation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMechanically driven seed {{metering}} devices currently perform their function efficiently {{and are a}} good {{solution to the problem}} of metering rates as seed is planted, but there are many voids that could be filled with a substantial change to the metering process. Electronically controlled seed singulation devices can address many of the inefficiencies experienced in a mechanically driven seed metering device and have the potential to increase productivity and yield rates dramatically. This research involves the process of designing, developing, and testing the feasibility of an apparatus used to precision place single <b>seeds</b> in a <b>furrow</b> during a planting operation. The equipment incorporated is a linear solenoid actuator connected with a special draw not used with any current seed metering device yet. The design uses an electronic device (based on 555 timer) to assist the solenoid in one movement (the forth movement of the draw), the back movement being accomplished by a spring. An optical electronic device was developed to trigger the 555 timer and the solenoid. This prototype gives a glimpse of what is possible in the future of seed singulation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effects of subsoiling, compaction on sowing <b>furrow</b> and <b>seed</b> treatments with insecticides on the grain yield of upland rice cultivated under no-tillage. Two experiments were carried out, one in an area with and the other in an area without subsoiling, in which five seed treatments combined with five compaction pressures on the sowing furrow were compared in a randomized block design, in a factorial scheme, with three replicates. The seed treatments were: T 0 - without treatment, T 1 - imidacloprid + thiodicarb, T 2 - thiamethoxam, T 3 - carbofuran, and T 4 - fipronil + pyraclostrobin + thiophanate methyl. The compaction pressures were: 25, 42, 126, 268 and 366 kPa. Subsoiling positively affected rice yield in the presence of higher compaction pressures on the sowing <b>furrow.</b> <b>Seed</b> treatment was effective at increasing rice grain yield only at the lowest compaction pressures. Rice yield showed quadratic response to compaction on the sowing furrow, with maximum values obtained at pressures ranging from 238. 5 to 280. 3 kPa...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the high}} costs of {{agricultural}} production, especially due to the price of fertilisers, particularly nitrogen, the use of inoculants to supply nitrogen to soybean crops is a widely recommended practice. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the feasibility of applying inoculants through <b>seed</b> and planting <b>furrow</b> in soil previously cultivated with soybean and Brazilian native “cerrado” biome soil under greenhouse conditions. Seven treatments were tested: 1) inoculation via seed (inoculant + fungicide + micronutrient), 2) treatment via seed (fungicide + micronutrient), 3) control (only seed), 4) inoculation via furrow-dose 1 (recommended dose), 5) inoculation via furrow-dose 2 (twice the recommended dose), 6) inoculation via furrow-dose 3 (three times the recommended dose) and 7) inoculation via furrow-dose 1 + seed inoculation. We evaluated plant height, fresh and dry matter weight of the aerial part and nodules, number of total, viable and non-viable nodules, number of pods per plant and grain yield. Inoculation was more effective when used in cerrado soil, but soybean performance in treatments without inoculation was higher in previously cultivated soil. Application through furrow proved to be a viable practice due to the similarity of the results obtained with the traditional application by seed...|$|R
