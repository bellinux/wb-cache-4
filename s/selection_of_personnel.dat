40|$|Proper <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> {{advisory}} <b>personnel</b> for "transition teams" {{is critical}} to military advisory efforts in Iraq. The selection procedures currently in place have shortcomings that may be best adjusted through analyzing historical experiences and prior lessons learned. The U. S. military has decades, if not more than a century, of advisory experience, to include with Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia. Transition teams' main purpose is to provide advisory support to the Iraqi Security Forces in garrison, training, and combat environments. Advisors are expected to live, work, train, and fight alongside their Iraqi counterparts. Clearly some personnel are better suited than others to such austere and often ambiguous environments. Therefore, discrete <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> appropriate <b>personnel</b> has {{to be considered for}} successful advising. Historic lessons learned, coupled with current experience advising Iraqi Security Forces, suggest the need to develop discrete selection criteria. Critical to selection is recruitment and screening <b>of</b> candidates. <b>Personnel</b> that are selected for advisory duty should then proceed to a preparatory phase in which advisor-specific skills are developed or enhanced prior to deployment. Assessment should continue through all phases of team formation and deployment to ensure that there is no degradation of individual suitability and / or team capability over time.

40|$|In {{service sectors}} such as {{management}} consulting, {{it is very}} difficult to measure the impact or success of a service even after it has been delivered. In these markets of goods between experience and credence, symbolic value is helpful and necessary to complement quality perceptions. The leading management consulting firms, in particular, do not only deliver data-driven analyses but also represent and symbolize the rational approach to business issues. This article looks at the role <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> <b>selection</b> in the context of quality symbolization. It argues that the predominant tool for personnel selection in the consulting sector, the case study, accounts for both a signalling effect of rationality to the business environment and a subjectification of consulting staff to the consulting culture and rationality beliefs. The case is made that, rather than leading to a valid <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> high-performance <b>personnel,</b> the process <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> <b>selection</b> has latent effects, which nonetheless contribute to the consulting industry's success.
