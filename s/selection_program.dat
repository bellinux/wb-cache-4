While selection work has been done since the late 1800s, most acreage of pecans grown today is of older cultivars, such as 'Stuart', 'Schley', and 'Desirable', with known flaws but also with known production potential. Newer cultivars, such as 'Elliot', are increasing in popularity due to their resistance to certain regional climate-related diseases.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Bean Golden Yellow Mosaic Virus (BGYMV) is {{a severe}} disease of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) that causes {{important}} yield losses. BGYMV is a geminivirus (family Geminiviridae) transmitted by Whitefly in tropical and sub-tropical countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Breeding for {{resistance to the}} virus {{has been the most}} effective strategy for controlling the disease. One resistance source, A 429, derived from the Durango landrace Garrapato (G 2402), and subsequent DOR lines developed at CIAT, were shown to contain a single recessive gene, bgm- 1, which reduces mosaic and yellowing symptoms. The marker SR 2 has been used in marker-assisted <b>selection</b> <b>programs</b> because it is linked to the bgm- 1 gene for resistance to BGYMV. In this study, SNP markers were developed from Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) data on the region associated with the bgm- 1 gene. These SNPs markers could constitute an important tool for marker-assisted <b>selection</b> <b>programs</b> for improvement of common bean cultivars with resistance to BGYMV...|$|R
40|$|In maize {{recurrent}} <b>selection</b> <b>programs,</b> selected genotypes were recombined once {{to generate}} genetic variability {{for the next}} selection cycle. Selection generates negative gametic phase disequilibrium which reduces genetic variances, and this disequilibrium is not significantly reduced with only one generation of recombination. The objective {{of this research was}} to assess the effects of one additional generation of recombination on phenotypic and genotypic parameters in a maize population undergoing recurrent selection. Selected progenies of the EPB- 4 population were subjected to one and two generations of recombination, and from each generation half- and full-sib progenies were developed and evaluated at three environments for grain yield, plant and ear heights, prolificacy, and ear placement. There were no significant changes between each progeny type with one and two generations of recombination for the means, ranges, phenotypic distribution of the traits, genetic variances, heritability coefficients, and genetic correlations for the traits assessed. The results suggest that an additional generation of recombination will not increase the effectiveness of maize recurrent <b>selection</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Implementation of marker {{assisted}} selection (MAS) in bread making quality (BMQ) oriented breeding {{programs could}} allow genetic potential assessment of genotypes {{prior to their}} phenotypic evaluation. The mechanisms underlying some quality traits in wheat are now understood. This knowledge, coupled with {{the availability of the}} DNA sequences of the genes encoding gluten proteins and the wide application of the PCR, has enabled the design of diagnostic DNA markers for these quality traits. Bread wheat breeding programs developed in Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops, Novi Sad have originated a wide range of quality cultivars with strong flours and hard grain texture. During twenty years, in the process of bread-making quality prediction, composition of HMW glutenin subunits were analyzed beside standard technological parameters. However, in order to improve our breeding strategies new generations of PCR-based BMQ related markers were included in <b>selection</b> <b>programs.</b> This paper provides an overview of diagnostic DNA markers that are currently in use in foreign and domestic wheat <b>selection</b> <b>programs.</b> ...|$|R

Our results, based on more than 18, 000 SNP markers, improve our comprehension of the population structure and provide a powerful subset of highly informative markers for stock assignment.
