25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>wine</b> journalists {{contend that}} chaptalization allows wine makers to {{sacrifice}} quality {{in favor of}} quantity by letting vines overproduce high yields of grapes that have not fully ripened. Also, winemakers have been using technological advances, such as reverse osmosis to remove water from the unfermented grape juice, thereby increasing its sugar concentration, but decreasing the volume of wine produced.|$|E

25|$|During a {{stopover}} in Sicily in 1949, on {{his return}} journey from South Africa, Arlott discovered wine {{for the very first}} time at the age of 35. From that day forth he eschewed beer and spirits and devoted himself to cultivating his love of wine. The following year, after recommending <b>some</b> <b>wine</b> to John Marshall, the editor of the London Evening News, he was invited to write a weekly wine column for that newspaper and this resulted in invitations to press tours of French wine regions.|$|E

25|$|Spain has a {{relatively}} large number of distinct wine-producing regions, more than half having the classification Denominación de Origen (DO), one of them Ribera del Duero was named Wine Region of the Year 2012 by the prestigious Wine Enthusiast Magazine, {{with the majority of}} the remainder classified as Vinos de la Tierra (VdlT). There are two regions nominated as Denominación de Origen Calificada (DOCa) - Rioja and Priorat - the flagship regions of Spanish winemaking. While most make both red and white wine, <b>some</b> <b>wine</b> regions are more dominated by one style than the other.|$|E
25|$|Both {{miraculously}} {{survived the}} crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat. Their maps were primitive and ambiguous. Lost among the sand dunes {{with a few}} grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and <b>some</b> <b>wine,</b> the pair had only one day's worth of liquid. They both began to see mirages, which were quickly followed by more vivid hallucinations. By {{the second and third}} days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a Bedouin on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment, which saved Saint-Exupéry's and Prévot's lives.|$|E

He kicks them out and begins cleaning up the mess. However, upon noticing Franz at the window, Coppélius invites him in. The inventor wants to bring Coppélia to life but, to do that, he needs a human sacrifice. With a magic spell, he will take Franz's spirit and transfer it to Coppélia. After Dr. Coppelius proffers him <b>some</b> <b>wine</b> laced with sleeping powder, Franz begins to fall asleep. The inventor then readies his magic spell.|$|E
5000|$|Astringency is {{also the}} dry, {{puckering}} mouthfeel caused by tannins found in many fruits such as blackthorn (sloe berries), Aronia chokeberry, chokecherry, bird cherry, quince and persimmon fruits, and banana skins. The tannins (which are types of polyphenols) bind the salivary proteins, causing them to precipitate or aggregate and lead to a rough [...] "sandpapery" [...] or dry sensation in the mouth. Tannins are found in <b>some</b> red <b>wines</b> and teas. A small amount of astringency is expected in <b>some</b> <b>wines,</b> especially young red wines made from grapes such as cabernet sauvignon and merlot.|$|R
50|$|In many respects, French wines {{have more}} of a {{regional}} than a national identity, as evidenced by different grape varieties, production methods and different classification systems in the various regions. Quality levels and prices vary enormously, and <b>some</b> <b>wines</b> are made for immediate consumption while other are meant for long-time cellaring.|$|R
50|$|Sémillon is also finding favour with Australian {{producers}} {{outside of}} the Hunter Valley in the Barossa Valley and Margaret River regions. The Adelaide Hills is becoming a flourishing region for Semillon, with the cooler climate producing <b>some</b> <b>wines</b> of great complexity.

25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>wine</b> experts {{debate the}} {{importance}} of humidity for proper wine storage. In the Wine Spectator, writer Matt Kramer cites a French study which claimed that the relative humidity within a bottle is maintained at 100% regardless of the closure used or {{the orientation of the}} bottle. However, Alexis Lichine contends that low humidity can still be detrimental to premium wine quality due to the risk of the cork drying out. As a way of maintaining optimal humidity, Lichine recommends spreading half an inch of gravel {{on the floor of a}} wine cellar and periodically sprinkling it with some water.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{has a large}} wine industry, and {{the value}} of wine exports surpassed A$2.3 billion in 2002-2003. Wine regions include the Barossa Valley in South Australia, Sunraysia in Victoria, Margaret River in Western Australia and the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. The key wine {{varieties}} grown in Australia (by area in 2001-2002) are Chardonnay, Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. Although the Australian wine industry enjoyed a large period of growth during the 1990s, over planting and over supply have led to a large drop in the value of wine, forcing <b>some</b> <b>wine</b> makers, especially those on contracts to large wine producing companies, out of business. The future for some Australian wine producers is now uncertain.|$|E
25|$|It {{was first}} {{recorded}} in Italy around Venice under the synonym Bordò in 1855. The grape {{was introduced to}} the Swiss, from Bordeaux, sometime in the 19th century and was recorded in the Swiss canton of Ticino between 1905 and 1910. In the 1990s, Merlot saw an upswing of popularity in the United States. Red wine consumption, in general, increased in the US following the airing of the 60 Minutes report on the French Paradox and the potential health benefits of wine and, possibly, the chemical resveratrol. The popularity of Merlot stemmed in part from the relative ease in pronouncing the name of the wine as well as its softer, fruity profile that made it more approachable to <b>some</b> <b>wine</b> drinkers.|$|E

25|$|Sauternes are {{characterized}} by the balance of sweetness with the zest of acidity. Some common flavor notes include apricots, honey, peaches but with a nutty note, which is a typical characteristic of noble semillon itself (cf. Australian noble (late-harvest) semillon). The finish can resonate on the palate for several minutes. Sauternes are some of longest-lived wines, with premium examples from exceptional vintages properly kept having the potential to age well even beyond 100 years. Sauternes typically starts out with a golden, yellow color that becomes progressively darker as it ages. <b>Some</b> <b>wine</b> experts, like Ed McCarthy and Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan, believe that only once the wine reaches the color of an old copper coin has it started to develop its more complex and mature flavors.|$|E
25|$|The Barbera grape is {{the most}} widely planted variety {{in all of the}} Piedmont and makes a juicy, muscular red wine that is not as tannic as Barolo and Barbaresco. It is grown in nearly every major wine making region of the Piedmont but seems to do best in the {{southern}} part of the province of Asti in the Nizza DOCG zone. Some producers are experimenting with blending Barbera with Nebbiolo to combine the former's fruitiness with the later's structure. The light fruitiness of wines from the Dolcetto grape has caused <b>some</b> <b>wine</b> writers to describe it as the Italian version of Beaujolais. The wines have a sense of spiciness to them with little acid and tannins. They are able to be drunk relatively young and tend to be the every day drinking wines of the Piedmontese.|$|E
25|$|Dionysus {{travels through}} {{the east and}} is entertained by a shepherd, Brongus, in a country fashion. In thanks for his hospitality, Dionysus gives him <b>some</b> <b>wine</b> and teaches him how to grow and harvest the vine. Astraeis informs Orontes, {{son-in-law}} of the Indian king Deriades, of {{the defeat of the}} Indian army and the ruse of the waters turned into wine. Orontes is furious and harangues his troops not to fear the effeminate Dionysus and his army of women. The Indians charge in and at first seem to win, but Dionysus screams like nine thousand men and detains them. Orontes and Dionysus engage in single combat: a tap of a vine cluster on Orontes' chest is enough to split his armour. Orontes plunges his sword into his own belly and throws himself into the river nearby, giving it his name (Orontes river). The Bacchic troops massacre the Indians. Astraeis flees.|$|E
