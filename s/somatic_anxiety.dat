25|$|People facing anxiety may {{withdraw}} from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past. There are {{various types of}} anxiety. Existential anxiety can occur when a person faces angst, an existential crisis, or nihilistic feelings. People can also face mathematical anxiety, <b>somatic</b> <b>anxiety,</b> stage fright, or test anxiety. Social anxiety and stranger anxiety are caused when people are apprehensive around strangers or other people in general. Furthermore, anxiety has been linked with physical symptoms such as IBS and can heighten other mental health illnesses such as OCD and panic disorder. The {{first step in the}} management of a person with anxiety symptoms is to evaluate the possible presence of an underlying medical cause, whose recognition is essential in order to decide its correct treatment. Anxiety symptoms may be masking an organic disease, or appear associated or {{as a result of a}} medical disorder.|$|E

Trait anxiety was operationalised using questionnaire scores and effort was operationalised using a visual analogue scale. Performance effectiveness was measured using the d′ parameter from signal detection theory and processing efficiency was indexed by the ratio of d′ to response time on correct trials. Results indicated that <b>somatic</b> trait <b>anxiety</b> and stress did not predict effectiveness or efficiency. Cognitive trait anxiety and stress were associated with both inhibitory effectiveness and efficiency deficits; however, contrary to expectations these deficits were evident at higher rather than lower mental effort. Results suggest a distinction between how <b>somatic</b> and cognitive <b>anxiety</b> manifest on tasks involving inhibitory control...|$|R

40|$|Deafness is {{a common}} neural-sensory {{impairment}} which leads to lower life quality, withdrawal, social activities reduction, and rejection feeling. So, {{it is important to}} plan suitable training programs for mental health promotion of deaf children. Emotional intelligence training is one of these programs. The present study was aimed to determine the effectiveness of emotional intelligence training on the mental health of deaf students. In this semi-experimental study with pretest and posttest design, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was completed in 40 randomly selected boy deaf students with mean age of (12. 48) years old before and after the intervention. The aim of the questionnaire was obtaining information of <b>somatic</b> symptoms, <b>anxiety,</b> social dysfunction, and depression as well as general health. The students were assigned in experimental and control group randomly and in equal. Experimental group participated in 12 sessions (each session lasts for 50 minutes; twice a week) and were trained by emotional intelligence program, but control group did not. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used for analyzing the data. There was a significant difference (P< 0. 001) between experimental and control group according to <b>somatic</b> symptoms, <b>anxiety,</b> social dysfunction, depression and general health as a whole after participation in intervention sessions.

50|$|Pregabalin (Lyrica) acts on the voltage-dependent {{calcium channel}} to {{decrease}} the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, norepinephrine and substance P. Its therapeutic effect appears after 1 week of use and is similar in effectiveness to lorazepam, alprazolam and venlafaxine but pregabalin has demonstrated superiority by producing more consistent therapeutic effects for psychic and <b>somatic</b> <b>anxiety</b> symptoms. Long-term trials have shown continued effectiveness without the development of tolerance and additionally, unlike benzodiazepines, it does not disrupt sleep architecture and produces less severe cognitive and psychomotor impairment. It also has a low potential for abuse and dependency and may be preferred over the benzodiazepines for these reasons. The anxiolytic effects of pregabalin appear rapidly after administration, similar to the benzodiazepines, which gives pregabalin an advantage over many anxiolytic medications such as antidepressants.|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjectives: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the mediational role of {{self-confidence}} and anxiety in the relationship between self-esteem and claimed self-handicapping in an achievement context. Design: To test this mediational role, the three-step procedure advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986) was used. Method: After hearing and reading about specific conditions of performing that were intended to favor invoking excuses for future poor performance, 68 competitive basketball players completed measures of self-esteem, <b>anxiety</b> (cognitive and <b>somatic),</b> self-confidence, and claimed self-handicapping. Then, they warmed-up and carried out a basketball task. Results: Self-esteem negatively predicted cognitive anxiety and positively predicted self-confidence. In turn, self-confidence negatively predicted claimed self-handicapping and mediated the relationship between self-esteem and claimed self-handicapping. Cognitive and <b>somatic</b> <b>anxieties</b> did not mediate the relationship between self-esteem and claimed self-handicapping. Together, these results suggest that individuals with low self-esteem use more claimed self-handicaps because they have lower self-confidence. Conclusion: These findings shed light on the psychological processes that lead people with low self-esteem to use strategies of claimed self-handicaps...|$|R

50|$|The Yerkes-Dodson Law spurred further {{research}} into its direct application in athletics. As a result, Sport psychologist, Yuri L. Hanin, developed the Zone of Optimal Functioning theory, which states, ″In order for an athlete to perform to their highest capability, they must experience their preferred level of anxiety.″ Hanin used a sport-specific {{version of the}} State-Trait Anxiety Inventory to measure the cognitive and <b>somatic</b> <b>anxiety</b> levels of each player before his or her performance. Hanin determined that each player has a certain range of pre-performance anxiety which leads to optimal performance. Hanin later postulates the functional relationship between emotions and optimal performance differs between each individual based on emotional factors, thus the revised version was called the Individual Zone of Optimal Functioning (IZOF). The newer model better accounts for ″the multidimensionality of emotional constructs″ by accounting for {{both positive and negative}} affect in athletes prior {{to the beginning of the}} sporting event. The study confirmed the existence of an ″association of the intensity of pre-competition state anxiety to optimal athletic performance.″ A majority of elite athletes perform personalized pre-game rituals in order to mentally prepare themselves for gameplay. Players may revert to these rituals immediately before the clutch moment so as to stabilize cognitive and anxiety in order to revert to their individual zone of optimal functioning. This type of self-control is what leads to the ability to excel in the clutch.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of an interdisciplinary program of Greek traditional dance with issues from music and sociology on high school students’ anxiety. 131 students (68 males & 63 females), between the ages from 12 to 13 yrs., participated. The experimental group (n= 62) followed the new eight-week program (two lessons/week) while the control group (n= 69) followed the typical physical education program. To evaluate students’ anxiety during lessons, the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory- 2 (Martens, Burton, Vealey, Bump, & Smith, 1990) was used with its 3 dimensions (<b>somatic,</b> cognitive <b>anxieties,</b> & self-confidence). Students completed it before the initiation of the intervention and after its completion. The following statistical analyses were performed: a) Factor Analysis, b) Cronbach's alpha test, and c) Anova with Repeated Measures. Results showed that a. “Somatic anxiety”, “cognitive anxiety” and “self confidence” accounted for 83 % and 73 %, respectively, of the total variance b) Cronbach's alpha was satisfactory (ranging from. 66,. 78 and. 71 for the initial and from. 87,. 94 and. 89 for the final measure), c) the experimental group decreased the levels of <b>somatic</b> and cognitive <b>anxieties</b> and enhanced their self-confidence. Also, male students increased their self-confidence more than female students. These findings support the view that an interdisciplinary program of traditional Greek dance and topics from music and sociology reduces the rates of <b>somatic</b> and cognitive <b>anxieties</b> while simultaneously increases students’ self-confidence's levels, and especially those of males...|$|R

In order to realize these aims, high school rugby players were compared to male adolescents who were not participating in any type of sport. A purposeful sample of 10 first team high school rugby players and 10 male adolescents not participating in any type of sport was drawn from a high school situated in the Gauteng Province of South Africa. Cognitive anxiety was measured through the administration of the State and Trait Anxiety subscales of the State-Trait Personality Inventory Form Y (STPI-Y) and the Sport Competition Anxiety Test (SCAT). <b>Somatic</b> <b>anxiety</b> was measured by investigating the salivary cortisol levels of the rugby players.
