40|$|RATIONALEFatty {{acids and}} sterol lipids play crucial roles in several {{biological}} processes and several biological facts underline the interconnection between these lipid classes. Therefore, {{it is of}} interest to develop a comprehensive method analysing both classes {{in the form of}} their most favourable derivatives suitable for quantification and isotopologue analysis. METHODSLipids were derivatised by a sequential one-pot procedure using N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (MtBSTFA) and N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA). No clean-up or concentration steps were necessary. The prepared samples were directly available for gas chromatography-electron ionisation mass spectrometric (GC-EI-MS) analysis on a standard column. For quantification, the SIM mode was used and for isotopologue analysis <b>scheduled</b> <b>scan</b> mode was applied. RESULTSDevelopment of a sequential one-pot derivatisation for GC-EI-MS allowing comprehensive analysis of fatty acids and sterols as their most favourable derivatives.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} if a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, 6 weeks post radiotherapy (RT), adequately selects patients in whom a neck node dissection can be omitted. Primary endpoints were isolated neck recurrences and overall survival (OS). Methods: 105 patients, mainly with oropharyngeal human papilloma virus (HPV) positive tumors, with a positive PET scan before treatment, were evaluated regarding the neck response 6 weeks post RT. The PET results determined the management of the neck: observation vs. neck dissection. Results: Median follow-up was 25 months. Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 56 % and 94 %, respectively. Four isolated neck recurrences occurred. The 2 year OS rate was 86. 3 %. Conclusion: PET scans performed 6 weeks after RT have a high NPV and can obviate neck dissections but the PPV is insufficient. A later <b>scheduled</b> <b>scan</b> is recommended.

30|$|This novel personalised {{approach}} {{also applies}} to the subsequent individualised timing of FDG injection. In addition to minimising the risk of unrecognised hypoglycaemia, regular 15 -minutely BGL monitoring after insulin administration until it reaches a nadir enables identification of the resolution of physiologic insulin effect. This approach minimises the time after insulin injection whilst maximising departmental efficiency and avoiding problems associated with premature insulin administration (especially increased muscle FDG uptake due to ongoing insulin action via GLUT 4 -mediated-facilitated glucose uptake). An elegant early study by Lindholm et al. neatly demonstrated a “sink effect” of increased muscle uptake and markedly poor scan quality due to endogenous hyperinsulinaemia 1 [*]h after glucose loading as the explanation for a significant (~[*] 50 %) reduction in SUVmax in head and neck malignancy, compared to studies performed in the fasting state [8]. Roy et al. observed a significantly increased risk of non-diagnostic scans at shorter intervals after insulin injection (minimum 60 -min post-iv insulin), and also patients with a greater insulin-induced fall in BGL when {{compared to patients with}} diagnostic-quality scans. This is further supported by Garcia et al. who demonstrated 60 % suboptimal PET/CT studies in patients that were injected with FDG whilst the BGL level was falling after subcutaneous insulin injection (30 – 115  min); all patients injected with FDG after 4 [*]h had optimal studies [20]. Although a standardised delay of 90 -min post-iv, or 240 -min after subcutaneous insulin injection [13] may be effective, some patients could be safely administered FDG earlier, and others may potentially require a longer delay. Our department routinely monitors BGL 15 -minutely after insulin injection to identify the nadir at which point the BGL starts to rise, indicating wearing-off of peripheral insulin action and ability to inject FDG without unwanted skeletal muscle uptake. The intrinsic variability of glucose monitors must be considered, and if there is doubt that the BGL has started to rise, a confirmatory repeat measurement 15 [*]min later is recommended. In our patients, FDG was safely administered at the earliest ~[*] 70 [*]min (noting that some patients required significantly longer delays), and no patients required repeat imaging for non-diagnostic scans. In contrast, other groups have recommended a minimum 60 -min delay between insulin and FDG injection, potentially explaining observed muscle uptake. Patients with diabetes are advised to present approximately 90 [*]min prior to their <b>scheduled</b> <b>scan</b> to minimise disruption to workflow by allowing time for insulin administration if necessary.|$|E

Abstract no. 5512 Background: Paz, an oral multikinase {{inhibitor}} of VEGF, PDGF and c-Kit has showed {{activity in}} advanced ovarian cancer. This study evaluated paz as maintenance therapy in Asian women with advanced ovarian cancer. Methods: Subjects with FIGO stage II, III, or IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer whose disease had not progressed after debulking surgery {{and followed by}} chemotherapy were randomized 1 : 1 to paz 800 mg once daily or placebo for up to 24 months. Primary endpoint was PFS by RECIST v 1. 0 based on visit date. If a progression occurred between the 2 scheduled visits (6 mos apart), progression was considered to have occurred at the next <b>scheduled</b> <b>scan</b> date. This minimized potential bias due to any imbalance of visit frequency between the arms. Results: 145 Asian subjects were randomized; 144 were treated. Mean age was 52. 9 years. At diagnosis 17 % were FIGO stage II, 73 % stage III and 10 % stage IV. After debulking surgery, 30 % (n = 44) had no residual disease and 41 % (n = 59) had. 47 % (28 / 59) had residual disease ≤ 1 cm. Prior to randomization, all subjects received median 8 cycles of chemotherapy; all subjects received platinum and taxane. At randomization 81 % had ECOG status 0, 97 % were disease free and all had normal CA- 125. At clinical data cut-off median PFS was 18. 1 months in both arms. Because of {{the small sample size}} a HR was not calculated but the KM curves indicated a trend in favor of paz from 6 to 18 mos; the curves crossed after 18 mos. The adverse event (AE) profile for paz was similar to previous reports except rates of hypertension and neutropenia were higher. The most frequent AEs (≥ 20 %) on the paz arm were hypertension (76 %), neutropenia (64 %), leucopenia (53 %), diarrhea (47 %), hair color changes (40 %), palm-plantar erythrodysaethesia syndrome (29 %), ALT increase (28 %), thrombocytopenia (24 %), AST increase (22 %) and TSH increase (21 %). Most of these AEs were Grade 1 - 2. Conclusions: The results of this study alone cannot confirm the efficacy of paz maintenance treatment in Asian women with ovarian cancer, but should be interpreted in conjunction of AGO-OVAR 16 study.

40|$|We {{study how}} best to <b>schedule</b> <b>scans</b> of large data files, in the {{presence}} of many simultaneous requests to a common set of files. The objective is to maximize the overall rate of processing these files, by sharing scans of the same file as aggressively as possible, without imposing undue wait time on individual jobs. This scheduling problem arises in batch data processing environments such as Map-Reduce systems, some of which handle tens of thousands of processing requests daily, over a shared set of files. As we demonstrate, conventional scheduling techniques such as shortest-job-first do not perform well {{in the presence of}} cross-job sharing opportunities. We derive a new family of scheduling policies specifically targeted to sharable workloads. Our scheduling policies revolve around the notion that, all else being equal, it is good to <b>schedule</b> nonsharable <b>scans</b> ahead of ones that can share IO work with future jobs, if the arrival rate of sharable future jobs is expected to be high.

We first formulate the scheduling problem as a distributed multi-coloring problem. We then experimentally show that the solution quality and communication cost of DSA exhibit phasetransition or thrashing behavior, in that the performance degenerates abruptly and dramatically when the degree of parallel executions of distributed agents increases beyond some critical value. The results show that when controlled properly, DSA is superior to DBA, having better or competitive solution quality and significantly smaller communication cost than DBA.

40|$|The {{problem of}} how to {{dynamically}} schedule a receiver to detect multiple emitters is modeled as a sensor resource allocation problem. It is shown how to specify a variety of receiver-based dynamic <b>scan</b> <b>scheduling</b> strategies that dynamically focus a sensor in different frequency bands so as to develop and maintain good information about an emitter environment. We contrast dynamic and 'ixed" scheduling policies, show how to incorporate emitter priorities, and we use simulation analyses to provide insights into the design and behavior of the policies. We explain how a 'response surface methodology" can be used to design optimal dynamic scan schedulers. Moreover, we introduce the idea of using the 'imultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation" method for optimal dynamic scan scheduler design when there are many emitters. Next, it is shown how to characterize and analyze stability properties (e. g., boundedness) of a variety of dynamic <b>scan</b> <b>scheduling</b> methods.

40|$|Background: The feasibility, safety, and {{potential}} demand of emergent {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) of patients with a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) in emergency situations are unknown. Methods: We retrospectively compared emergent and scheduled MRI orders for patients with CIEDs at Kameda General Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Japan, from October 2012 to September 2016. Results: We identified 11 emergent MRI orders via the emergency room and 38 scheduled MRI orders. Although the baseline characteristics were similar {{between the two groups}}, brain scanning was predominant in emergent scanning (p= 0. 002). The reasons for MRI and physicians who ordered it were also significantly different between the two groups (p< 0. 001, p= 0. 03, respectively). Among the emergent orders via the emergency room, 10 out of 11 were brain scans. Nine out of 10 patients underwent successful emergent brain MRI. The time from arrival at the emergency room to MRI was 144 ± 29  min, and the time from the MRI order made by the cardiologist to its actual performance was 60 ± 10  min. Four out of 9 patients had a diagnosis of acute stroke confirmed by emergent MRI, and two had emergent thrombolysis with a complete neurological recovery.

We designed this open-label phase II trial to determine the response rate, safety, and tolerability of oral DCA in patients with metastatic breast cancer and advanced stage {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). Materials and methods: This trial was conducted with DCA 6. 25 mg/kg orally twice daily in previously treated stage IIIB/IV NSCLC or stage IV breast cancer. Growth inhibition by DCA was also evaluated in a panel of 54 NSCLC cell lines with and without cytotoxic chemotherapeutics (cisplatin and docetaxel) in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Results and conclusions: Under normoxic conditions in vitro, single-agent IC 50 was > 2 mM for all evaluated cell lines. Synergy with cisplatin was seen in some cell lines under hypoxic conditions. In the clinical trial, after seven patients were enrolled, the study was closed based on safety concerns. The only breast cancer patient had stable disease after 8 weeks, quickly followed by progression in the brain. Two patients withdrew consent within a week of enrollment. Two patients had disease progression prior to the first <b>scheduled</b> <b>scans.</b> Within 1 week of initiating DCA, one patient died suddenly of unknown cause and one experienced a fatal pulmonary embolism. We conclude that patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC did not benefit from oral DCA. In the absence of a larger controlled trial, firm conclusions regarding the association between these adverse events and DCA are unclear. Further development of DCA should be in patients with longer life expectancy, in whom sustained therapeutic levels can be achieved, and potentially in combination with cisplatin. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
