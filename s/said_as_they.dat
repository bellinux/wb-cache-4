He had repeatedly offered to respect the judgement of an impartial arbitration team, he reminded Johnston, but the British had shot this idea down each time. He therefore felt compelled to follow the advice given by his own legal team, which was that the appointment was legitimate. His government would not accept a lesser appointment in Lisbon than in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques. He dismissed Johnston's threat to expel the Rhodesian representatives in West Germany, Japan and America; relations with Portugal and South Africa were far more important, he <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were Rhodesia's two closest neighbours geographically.|$|E
2500|$|Lees {{returned}} to England in 1921, and handed in his resignation. Following {{studies at the}} Royal School of Mines, he joined the Anglo-Persian Oil Company as an Assistant Geologist, despite having no formal qualifications, and {{returned to}} the Middle East in 1922. In 1924 he and the geologist Hugo De Böckh toured south-west Persia, identifying several productive oil fields. On one occasion, Lees went to swim across the Karun river and was swept away. The other geologists returned to camp. [...] "Ah, Lees is gone," [...] they <b>said.</b> <b>As</b> <b>they</b> were about to organise a funeral party, Lees turned up. His cork hat, which he used to keep himself afloat by filling it with air and keeping it under the water, had saved him. In this way, it was said, a single hat changed the destiny of Anglo Persian and its successor, British Petroleum. De Böckh and Lees later published the theoretical side of their work in the paper The Structure of Asia, edited by J. W. Gregory and presented to the British Association in 1928.|$|E
