40|$|Background: The aim of {{the current}} study was to observe the effects of Twenty-four Move <b>Shadow</b> <b>Boxing</b> {{combined}} with psychosomatic relaxation on depression and anxiety in patients with Type- 2 Diabetes. Subjects and methods: One hundred and twenty (120) patients with Type- 2 Diabetes and depressive/anxious symptoms were divided into intervention group (60 cases) and control group (60 cases) according to the minimum distribution principle of unbalanced indicators. Twenty-four Move <b>Shadow</b> <b>Boxing</b> group used this intervention combined with psychosomatic relaxation. Control group underwent conventional treatment. All the patients in the two groups completed the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) before and after treatment. Results: Among the 52 people included in the statistical analysis, the recovery rate was 13. 3 %. The differences between depression and anxiety scores in the intervention group before and after treatment were statistically significant (P< 0. 001), whereas these differences were non-significant in the control group (P= 0. 123). After the treatment, the glycated hemoglobin reduction in the intervention group was greater than that of the control group (t= 2. 438, P= 0. 016).
