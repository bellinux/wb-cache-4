This had to be paid within four weeks or he would have to serve an extra 150 days of hard labour.|$|E

25|$|Marillier's last {{domestic}} {{commitment was}} for Zimbabwe A against Pakistan A in 2005. After {{that he did}} not play any official cricket.

In 2009, he turned out for 'Red Lions' in the Zimbabwean Winter Premier Cricket League and it was believed that he was a player to return through franchise system.

25|$|A 2003 {{report by}} archaeologists {{indicates}} {{a possibility that}} grapes were mixed with rice to produce mixed fermented beverages in China {{in the early years}} of the seventh millennium BC. Pottery jars from the Neolithic site of Jiahu, Henan, contained traces of tartaric acid and other organic compounds commonly found in wine. However, other fruits indigenous to the region, such as hawthorn, cannot be ruled out. If these beverages, which <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> precursors of rice wine, included grapes rather than other fruits, they would have been any of the several dozen indigenous wild species in China, rather than Vitis vinifera, which was introduced there 6000 years later.|$|E
25|$|It {{may have}} been, but {{probably}} was not, limited to Kiritimati; while no remains have been found, little fieldwork {{has been conducted}} and judging from the Tuamotu sandpiper's habits, almost all Line Islands would have offered suitable habitat. The Kiritimati population of P. cancellata disappeared in the earlier part of the 19th century or so, almost certainly due to predation by introduced mammals. While Prosobonia generally manage to hold their own against Polynesian rats, they are highly vulnerable to the black rat and feral cats. Given the uncertainties surrounding the introduction date and maximum population of the former, the cats <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> main culprits in the Kiritimati sandpiper's extinction.|$|E

The Prospectors and Miners Association of Victoria use the Eureka Flag as their official flag and would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only 'rightful' and 'correct' user of the flag today.

25|$|The smelter remains {{which were}} renovated by Kilkivan Shire Council in 1978, {{are exposed to}} ground level. The smelter is made of brick and stone, the walls {{standing}} to a height of 170cm at the fire-box end, and to 120cm height {{at the opposite end}} of the smelter. These heights seem to correlate with the spring-level of the now collapsed arched roof. The internal ovoid form of the reverberatory smelter can be readily seen. The fire-box is particularly well preserved and has a deep below-ground access. Iron staples are inserted into the base plinth of the smelter at regular intervals and <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> support points for the rail reinforcing bars which would have originally bound the smelter.|$|E
25|$|The bulk of Buxtehude's oeuvre {{consists}} of vocal music, which covers {{a wide variety}} of styles, and organ works, which concentrate mostly on chorale settings and large-scale sectional forms. Chamber music constitutes a minor part of the surviving output, although the only chamber works Buxtehude published during his lifetime were fourteen chamber sonatas. Unfortunately, many of Buxtehude's compositions have been lost. The librettos for his oratorios, for example, survive; but none of the scores do, which is particularly unfortunate, because his German oratorios <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> model for later works by Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Philipp Telemann. Further evidence of lost works by Buxtehude and his contemporaries {{can be found in the}} recently discovered catalogue of a 1695 music-auction in Lübeck.|$|E
