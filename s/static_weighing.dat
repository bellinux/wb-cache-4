A Coriolis Effect mass flow meter is used to verify tractor manufacturer’s fuel consumption claims at the Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory (NTTL). The accuracy requirement placed on the flow meter by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in the Code 2 tractor performance test procedure is not clear, but in the most conservative interpretation is ± 0. 5 % of each flow rate measured. Results showed a dynamic weighing calibration method was not accurate enough to obtain a calibration of the flow meter to the desired accuracy level.

40|$|Effective truck weight {{enforcement}} {{has become}} a critical issue {{as a result of}} the continual increase in the number of trucks on U. S. and Texas roads, as well as the impending truck-traffic-related provisions of NAFTA. These provisions will enable less restricted trade between the U. S. and Mexico by permitting reciprocal access to roads in both countries. As nearly two-thirds of the U. S. /Mexico truck traffic travels through Texas, the protection of Texas highways {{has become a}} forefront issue. Feasible alternative technologies that should be considered by policymakers, engineers, and enforcement officers as they attempt to choose optimal truck weight enforcement methods for protecting the existing and future infrastructure are presented in this report. A review of the current conditions along the Texas/Mexico border, with respect to trade, infrastructure, and weight regulations, provides background information on the subject. The report contains a state-of-the-practice description of <b>static</b> <b>weighing</b> techniques currently used in Texas as well as a description of weigh-in-motion (WIM) technology that might be applicable to weight enforcement. The advantages and disadvantages of WIM sorting vs. traditional <b>static</b> <b>weighing</b> methods are itemized, and different enforcement techniques are evaluated and compared according to their capabilities, constraints, productivity, safety, accuracy, and applicability.

40|$|AbstractVehicle {{overloading}} {{has been}} identified as one of the major contributors to road pavement damage in Malaysia. In this study, the weigh-in-motion (WIM) system has been used to function as a vehicle weight sorting tool to complement the exsiting <b>static</b> <b>weigh</b> bridge enforcement station. Data collected from the developed system is used to explore the effectiveness of using WIM system in terms of generating more accurate data for enforcement purposes {{and at the same time}} improving safety and reducing the number of vehicle weight violations on the roads. This study specifically focus on the effect of vehicle by-pass and <b>static</b> <b>weigh</b> station enforcement capability on the overall effectiveness of vehicle weight enforcement system in a developing country. Results from this study suggest that the WIM system will significantly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the current vehicle weight enforcement, thus generating substantial revenue that would greatly off-set the current road maintenance budget that comes from tax payers money. If there is substantial reduction in overloaded vehicles, the public will still gain through reduction in road maintenance budget, less accident risks involving heavy trucks, and lesser greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions...|$|R

40|$|Deteriorating roadway {{conditions}} have drawn {{attention to the}} need to develop an accurate and practical system to control increasing excessive traffic volumes and traffic loads. In practice, traffic volumes often exceed predicted volumes, and truck overloading occurs frequently. Overloading pavements can result in premature deterioration, early or mistimed maintenance activities and eventually higher life cycle costs. As a part of an Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially in the area of Commercial Vehicle Operations (CVO), Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) has been focused on using state-of-the-art sensing technology to continuously collect vehicle weights, speeds, vehicle classes, and various types of traffic data as vehicles travel over a set of sensors (embedded or portable), without interruption of traffic flows. It is the process of measuring the dynamic tire forces of a moving vehicle and estimating the corresponding tire loads of the static vehicles. WIM technology is imperative for weight enforcement, road network design and management, as well as road safety. The overall purpose of this thesis is to examine the feasibility of using WIM in northern environments such as Canada’s. In response, one contribution of the thesis is to develop an economic model for WIM values that include costs due to premature pavement deterioration, benefits of weight enforcement and traffic data collection, benefits of WIM compared to conventional <b>static</b> <b>weigh</b> stations, and benefit-cost ratios of WIM values from road users and non-road users’ perspectives. Another contribution is to examine the technical performance (accuracy) of a particular WIM system. Results of field data collection and analysis are presented in this examination. This thesis also compares {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different WIM systems, with respect to cost, accuracy, applicability, reliability, and sensitivity. Future trends and research potential of WIM are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Maximum weight bearing observed, using a <b>static</b> <b>weighing</b> scale, in above-knee amputees {{wearing an}} airsplint, {{with a foot}}, was 10 kg and in below-knee amputees 11 kg with {{inflation}} pressures of 40 mmHg. While airsplints with a foot permitted greater weight bearing before deformation occurred, the increase is judged to be of little clinical advantage. Use of an airsplint without a foot would be'more efficient for immediate post-operative dressing and for early ambulation in the parallel bars as it is less cumbersome and not subject to toe drag in the swing phase of gait. With the type of airsplints studied inflation pressures above 45 mmHg offered no advantage in terms of weight bearing in the below-knee amputee. In the above-knee amputee similarly, inflation pressures over 40 mmHg offered no advantage and {{had the effect of}} reducing the suspension of the prosthesis on the stump...|$|E
40|$|The {{filtration}} {{process of}} measurement signals which occur in industrial weighing systems, decides upon {{the accuracy of}} measurement and the duration time of the weighing process alike. The filtration problem gains great meaning in automatic catchweighing instruments whose rate of operation, in case of <b>static</b> <b>weighing,</b> can reach even a hundred weighings per minute. Since output signals from the catchweighing instruments, due to mechanical vibrations and the noise from the environment, are always contaminated with noise, filtration methods which ensure strong attenuation of vibrations and fast transmission of the signal’s constant component, should be applied. In this case, filtration methods involving nonstationary filters {{turn out to be}} a good solution. In the paper the filtration method using a discrete nonstationary filter has been discussed. The results of the numerical experiment which was carried out based on the measurement signals recorded on the catchweigher operating in the industrial environment, have been presented. The results obtained using the nonstationary filter have been compared with its stationary equivalent...|$|E
40|$|During {{a one-year}} {{supervision}} phase the function {{and operation of}} dynamic axle load weighing equipment was to be investigated at five measuring points on motorways in Hesse according to the bending plate principle {{in conjunction with a}} traffic computer centre, and during this period any longterm data and sporadic data collected on individual vehicles was to be analysed. An evaluation system was to be developed for the long-term data, and this was to be programmed {{in the form of a}} database. Furthermore, correlations between axle load distributions and the vehicle mix, depending on the traffic characteristics of a section, were to be investigated. During the test operation the accuracy of the dynamic axle load equipment was to be checked with the aid of <b>static</b> <b>weighing</b> equipment (wheel load measuring equipment), and the experience gained during the practical operation of the equipment systems was to be documented. The documentation of all breakdowns and malfunctions showed limited breakdown times of a total of one to three weeks for each of the five measuring points during a stipulated eight-month analysis period. In the initial phase there were a few breakdowns and malfunctions in the equipment due to hardware and software errors, which were immediately remedied through exchanging the respective defect electronic components and improving the software - in particular to adapt it to the TLS requirements. With regard to the accuracy of the axle load measurements compared to the static measuring results, relatively limited deviations were determined, and the long-term stability of the calibration setting was proved over a period of six months. After initial difficulties, the equipment system with bending plates which was used for these measurements was hence able to prove its suitability, above all with regard to the further expansion of the network.

40|$|For {{the past}} two decades, {{weigh-in-motion}} (WIM) sensors {{have been used in}} the United States to collect vehicle weight data for designing pavements and monitoring their performance. The use of these sensors is now being expanded for enforcement purposes to provide virtual weigh stations for screening vehicles in traffic streams for overweight violations. A study found that <b>static</b> <b>weigh</b> stations in Indiana were effective for identifying safety violations, but ineffective for identifying overweight vehicles. It was also determined that the alternative approach to identifying overweight vehicles using virtual weigh stations requires a high level of WIM data accuracy and reliability that can only be attained with a rigorous quality control program. Accurate WIM data is also essential {{to the success of the}} Long-term Pavement Performance project and the development of new pavement design methods. This dissertation proposes a quality control program that addresses vehicle classification, speed, axle spacing, and weight accuracy by identifying robust metrics that can be continuously monitored using statistical process control procedures that differentiate between sensor noise and events that require intervention. The speed and axle spacing accuracy is assessed by examining the drive tandem axle spacing of the population of Class 9 vehicles. The weight accuracy is assessed by examining the left-right steer axle residual weight of the population of Class 9 vehicles. Data mining of these metrics revealed variations in the data caused by incorrect calibration, sensor failure, temperature, and precipitation. The accuracy metrics could be implemented in a performance-based specification for WIM systems that is more feasible to enforce than the current specifications based on comparing static vehicle weights with dynamic vehicle weights measured by the WIM sensors. The quality control program can also be used by agencies to prioritize maintenance to more effectively allocate the limited funds available for sensor repair and calibration. This research provides a tool that agencies can use to obtain and sustain higher quality WIM data. ...|$|R
40|$|Transportation by trucks plays a {{major role}} in North America’s economy. The growth of this {{industry}} will increase the loads on existing roads and highways and raises the possibility of overloaded vehicles, which causes significant damage to the pavement and consequently will reduce the lifespan of the roads. Weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems technology helps to address the challenge of overloaded vehicles. This technology provides traffic monitoring, collects data for pavement research and design, and improves the capacity of <b>static</b> <b>weigh</b> station operations. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the behaviour of WIM sensors installed in different environments, which affects reliable and precise data gathering. More knowledge is required on proper installation procedures, pavement design for WIM systems, choice of sensor type for location, and calibration processes. This research is intended to explore the behaviour of WIM piezoelectric sensors under different loads and environmental conditions. Specifically, the effects of air and pavement temperature, and weight and speed of trucks are examined with respect to the estimation accuracy of WIM sensors. To accomplish this, three WIM systems composed of different piezoelectric transducers were installed at the CPATT test site at the Waste Management facility of the Region of Waterloo in 2007, and two WIM systems were installed between exits 238 and 250 on Highway 401 eastbound near Woodstock, Ontario. It was concluded that the output of the polymer piezoelectric sensor is influenced by temperature and weight factors but not by normally observed vehicle speed differences. While temperature can be compensated for, not enough information has been gathered yet does the same for weight factor. It should be noted that very low speeds (e. g. < 50 km/hr) result in significant errors for all the sensors, so that in congested sections WIM results should be interpreted accordingly. These results will be useful for investigating the effects of environmental conditions on other WIM systems and for predicting the responses of sensors in actual installation environments. This will assist in the recommendation of: (1) alternative and transparent calibration procedures for the WIM sensor systems, (2) and improved benefits of least expensive technology...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} 2 -D Moses algorithm for {{acquiring the}} field-calibrated influence line (IL) {{of an existing}} bridge is presented, based on strain data acquired continuously at a high scanning rate with calibration vehicles of known axle weights and axle spacings crossing an instrumented bridge. Considering the transverse distribution of the wheel loads on each girder due to two-dimensional (2 -D) behavior of slab-girder bridge, the ILs {{of each of the}} girders can be calculated, which does not require the girders to possess the identical material and geometrical properties. By using the calculated ILs of each girder as references, a modified 2 -D Moses algorithm was derived to identify axle weights of moving vehicles, taking into consideration the transverse distribution of the wheel loads on each girder. Mathematical equations to calculate ILs and axle weights were derived, and the proposed algorithms were implemented by a computer program written in MATLAB. The accuracy of the ILs calculation and axle weight identification was verified through a field test of a bridge on highway US- 78 in Alabama. The identified axle weights showed agreement with the <b>static</b> measurements from <b>weighing</b> pads and with results from the bending-plate weigh-in-motion (BPWIM) system near the instrumented bridge. ...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{advances}} {{now make}} it possible to continuously record and monitor a range of outcomes on dairy farms including individual cow milk yields, environmental temperature and rainfall. These facilities enhance the ability of herd managers to recognise deviations from what is accepted as normal, prompting timely corrective intervention. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how liveweights recorded using walkover weighing (WoW) technology can provide information {{that can be used to}} better-manage a range of activities on dairy farms, particularly reproduction and herd health. Analysis of daily WoW recorded over the first 100 days of lactation have shown that the standard deviation of daily LW measurements across parities was 17 kg on average. A near perfect association between liveweights measured statically and WoWs (concordance correlation coefficient 0. 99, 95 % CI 0. 99 to 1. 0) was observed. After controlling for the effect of liveweight at calving and long term liveweight change using a mixed-effects linear regression model, the autocorrelation between WoWs recorded on successive days was 0. 21, decaying to zero by eight days. This study showed that by using a standalone automatic WoW system positioned in the exit race of a rotary milking parlour, it was possible to record LWs of individual cows on a daily basis and, with controlled cow flow over the weighing platform (allowing for sufficient succession distance to prevent congestion), results were similar to those recorded using conventional, <b>static</b> <b>weighing</b> techniques. Two observational studies were conducted to investigate the relationships between LW, LWchange (LW) and clinical lameness. In the first study, LW loss in the first 50 days in milk increased the risk of a lameness event being diagnosed after 50 days in milk by a factor of 1. 80 (95 % CI 1. 00 to 3. 17). The risk of lameness was greatest for high yielding cows that lost excessive LW (risk ratio 4. 36, 95 % CI 4. 21 to 8. 19). The second study quantified LW immediately before and after the diagnosis of lameness events. For lame cows, liveweight decreased up to three weeks before the date of diagnosis and for up to four weeks after. The total liveweight loss arising from a single lameness episode was, on average, 61 kg (95 % CI 47 to 74 kg). The results of this study show how liveweight records for individual animals can be used to enhance a herd manager’s ability to detect lame cows and present them for treatment. Prompt detection and treatment of lame cows presents an opportunity to shorten recovery times, with positive follow-on effects in terms of animal welfare. LW was assessed as a means for enahancing the sensitivity and specificity of oestrus detection. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting true oestrus events using LW combined with tail paint and visual observation was 0. 86 and 0. 94, respectively. The effect of LW in the first four weeks after calving (LWlong) and LW change around the time of the Planned Start of Mating (LWshort) on the time taken for cows to conceive relative to the Planned Start of Mating was quantified. Planned Start of Mating to conception intervals were influenced by LW change during both of these periods, though LWshort had a greater effect compared with LWlong. The findings of this study better define the impact of long- and short-term liveweight change on reproductive performance, providing the opportunity to design feeding programmes in pasture fed dairy herds that have positive effects on fertility. The studies presented in this thesis contribute knowledge to the role of LWmonitoring as a tool to better-manage seasonally calving, pasture fed dairy herds. While ‘traditional’ usage of walkover scales on dairy farms has involved the recording of LWand LWchange as a means for monitoring and adapting changes to the herd feeding program, the studies presented here have shown how LW records have the potential to provide information that can be used to better manage a range of herd level activities, particularly those related to reproductive management and health...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, fabrication {{and testing of}} novel grating based Optical Fibre Sensor (OFS) systems being interrogated using “off the shelf” interrogation systems, with the eventual development of marketable commercial systems {{at the forefront of}} the research. Both in the industrial weighing and aerospace industries, there has been a drive to investigate the feasibility of using optical fibre sensors being deployed where traditionally their electrical or mechanical counterparts would traditionally have been. Already, in the industrial weighing industry, commercial operators are deploying OFS-based Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) systems. Likewise, in the aerospace industry, OFS have been deployed to monitor such parameters as load history, impact detection, structural damage, overload detection, centre of gravity and the determination of blade shape. Based on the intrinsic properties of fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) and Long Period Fibre Gratings (LPFGs), a number of novel OFS-based systems have been realised. Experimental work has shown that in the case of <b>static</b> industrial <b>weighing,</b> FBGs can be integrated with current commercial products and used to detect applied loads. The work has also shown that embedding FBGs in e-glass, to form a sensing patch, can result in said patches being bonded to rail track, forming the basis of an FBG-based WIM system. The results obtained have been sufficiently encouraging to the industrial partner that this work will be progressed beyond the scope of the work presented in this thesis. Likewise, and to the best of the author’s knowledge, a novel Bragg grating based systems for aircraft fuel parameter sensing has been presented. FBG-based pressure sensors have been shown to demonstrate good sensitivity, linearity and repeatability, whilst LPFG-based systems have demonstrated a far greater sensitivity when compared to FBGs, as well the advantage of being potentially able to detect causes of fuel adulteration based on their sensitivity to refractive index (RI). In the case of the LPFG-based system, considerable work remains to be done on the mechanical strengthening to improve its survivability in a live aircraft fuel tank environment. The FBG system has already been developed to an aerospace compliant prototype and is due to be tested at the fuel testing facility based at Airbus, Filton, UK. It is envisaged by the author that in both application areas, continued research in this area will lead to the eventual development of marketable commercial products...|$|R
