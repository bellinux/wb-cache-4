He used to begin to study at night on the Festival of Vulcan, not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter he would {{commence}} at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and it would come upon him and leave {{him in the middle}} of his work. Before daybreak he would go to Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.|$|E
500|$|In these series, Van Gogh was not preoccupied by {{his usual}} {{interest}} in filling his paintings with subjectivity and emotion; rather the two series {{are intended to}} display his technical skill and working methods to Gauguin, {{who was about to}} visit. The 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist. Vincent wrote to Theo in August 1888, [...] "I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't <b>surprise</b> <b>you</b> when it's a question of painting large sunflowers... If I carry out this plan there'll be a dozen or so panels. The whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow. I work on it all these mornings, from sunrise. Because the flowers wilt quickly and it's a matter of doing the whole thing in one go." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 2007 Time {{magazine}} ran {{an article}} by James Poniewozik titled [...] "Is Shrek Bad for Kids?" [...] which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires, instead of the original stories. Poniewozik mentioned Hoodwinked! writing, [...] "I thought Hoodwinked! {{and most of the}} Shrek series were hilarious... But even if you ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary. There's something a little sad about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood." [...] Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, [...] "As the writer-director of Hoodwinked, it may <b>surprise</b> <b>you</b> that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as I was making the film, I asked myself the same question: Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We {{went to great lengths to}} distance our film from Shreks humor (and no, I don't think Shrek considers kids). I would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence. We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales, whether we admit it or not." ...|$|E

500|$|Positive reviews {{praised the}} film for {{presenting}} {{a more realistic}} approach to the Boogeyman and eschewing CGI, {{both of which were}} considered improvements over its predecessor. Its death scenes were highly praised for being extremely violent and gory. Many reviewers also recognized that the film exceeded their expectations despite its direct-to-video status and low budget. Shawn Lealos of CHUD.com gave the film a score of 6.8 out of ten, stating that it was [...] "a very solid little horror flick that forgoes the ridiculous CGI and hokum supernatural aspects of the first movie, as well as the restraints of PG-13." [...] In a similar review, Matthew Stern of PopMatters praised the film in comparison to its predecessor, giving it eight stars out of ten, with a consensus reading: [...] "A film that bucks the stigma of direct-to-DVD sequels, this unyieldingly dark and bloody feature will <b>surprise</b> <b>you,</b> especially if you were unfortunate enough to catch the first one." [...] David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews also praised Boogeyman 2 over the first film, particularly for its [...] "satisfying kill sequences" [...] and an entertaining supporting cast. While he criticized the middle half as [...] "uneventful," [...] he felt that the film [...] "recovers nicely for a surprisingly enthralling third act" [...] and gave it 2.5/4 stars.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the club}} entered {{a period of}} decline soon after and, just two years after their cup triumph, were relegated to the Second Division {{at the end of}} the 1928–29 season, despite conceding the least number of goals in the division. An ageing Keenor became a target of {{frustrated}} fans as Cardiff entered a period of financial difficulty that saw the majority of the teams star names sold in a bid to raise funds and the team struggled in the Second Division. Prior to the 1930–31 season, Keenor, still on the wages he had been given when the club was in the First Division, was given a pay cut by the club of a quarter during the season and a half during the off season. The cut was offered by club director Walter Bartley Wilson, who had told Keenor that [...] "I'm sorry but I'm going to surprise you" [...] prior to telling him of the cut which was instigated to leave Keenor with no choice but to leave the club, however he replied to Wilson [...] "Bart, I'm going to <b>surprise</b> <b>you</b> too. I'm going to take it". Despite this, he was eventually dropped from the team as they struggled for form and the club signed Jack Galbraith as a replacement. They eventually finished the season in 22nd position and were relegated to the Third Division South. Keenor played his final match for the club on 6 April 1931 against Tottenham Hotspur, along with the club's all-time record goalscorer Len Davies, before being released {{at the end of the}} season, ending a 19-year spell with the side.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a letter}} to Theo, dating from 21 or 22 August 1888, Vincent wrote: [...] "I'm {{painting}} with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won’t <b>surprise</b> <b>you</b> when it's a question of painting large sunflowers." [...] At this time he had three paintings on the go, and intended to do more; as he explained to his brother: [...] "in the hope {{of living in a}} studio of our own with Gauguin, I'd like to do a decoration for the studio.

2500|$|.....in came Freddie Trueman who {{appeared}} determined {{to knock the}} cover off the ball. He blasted some very quick runs, which included two straight sixes off the mortified Richie Benaud. Freddie can always {{be counted on to}} <b>surprise</b> <b>you.</b> After the towering first six, he appealed against the light! Even for fiery Freddie, that was cheek of the highest order. Richie and I both burst out laughing and, needless to say the appeal was not upheld. Test cricket can have its lighter moments. Freddie's response was to crash another giant six about 20 yards deeper, but unfortunately, he tried to do it again and was caught by Benaud off Mackay at extra cover.|$|E
2500|$|Star Fox 2 {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} release {{as part of}} the Super NES Classic Edition. Eurogamer recommended the game as [...] "wonderfully surprising and inventive". Polygon described it as ambitious and fun. Nintendo World Report gave it 9/10 and wrote that it was [...] "arguably the most important game in the Star Fox series, and one of the greatest Super Nintendo games". Nintendo Life gave the game 8/10, writing: [...] "this 22-year-old relic is worth owning a SNES Mini for, and may well <b>surprise</b> <b>you</b> with its depth, complexity and challenge – so long as you're not expecting a straight sequel to the original." [...] Destructoid gave it 7/10, describing it as [...] "solid and definitely has an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun." [...] IGN gave it 5/10, complementing its [...] "janky-yet-plucky aesthetic", but complained that severe frame-rate drops plagued the game and that it was difficult to control the ships. They stated it was the worst game in the SNES Classic Edition and that, [...] "Looking back, it probably deserved to be cancelled".|$|E

2500|$|Onions was {{selected}} for England's tour of South Africa in November 2009 to January 2010. His bowling average for the series was in the 40s, but his batting twice helped England save a Test in a battling rearguard action on the fifth day. He was dropped for the fourth and final Test in favour of Ryan Sidebottom. Onions {{felt that he was}} denied an opportunity to bowl in conditions more suited to his style of bowling than previous matches and was surprised by his omission. He commented that [...] "When Straussy gave me the bad news, my reaction was one of sheer <b>surprise.</b> <b>You</b> could have knocked me down with last year's Newcastle season ticket. I tried to rationalise what had happened. I know my stats haven't been brilliant, but I feel I have bowled well enough to earn a better return." [...] South African fast-bowler Dale Steyn remarked that South Africa too were surprised at Onions being dropped: [...] "He would have been a handful on this wicket, he gets very tight into the stumps and could have been very dangerous... obviously Onions has troubled a lot of our batsmen throughout the series and it's surprising to see he wasn't playing. It {{was a bit of a}} relief in a way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to <b>surprise</b> <b>you,</b> but it had to be true, also. You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field. That's a pretty great moment and we didn't know until we showed it to audiences" [...] that it would work. Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E
