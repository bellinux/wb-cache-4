5|$|The {{appearance}} of features from The Art of War in other historical texts {{is considered to}} be proof of his historicity and authorship. Certain strategic concepts, such as terrain classification, are attributed to Sun Tzu. Their use in other works such as The Methods of the Sima is considered proof of Sun Tzu's historical priority. According to Ralph Sawyer, it is very likely Sun Tzu did exist and not only served as a general but also wrote the core of the book that bears his name. It is argued that there is a disparity between the large-scale wars and sophisticated techniques detailed in the text and the more primitive small-scale battles that many believe predominated in China during the 6th century BC. Against this, Sawyer argues that the teachings of Sun Wu were probably taught to succeeding generations in his family or a small school of disciples, which eventually included Sun Bin. These descendants or <b>students</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> revised or expanded upon certain points in the original text.|$|E

However, the Commission found that [...] "the ABS resident population estimates have limitations when used for assessing housing demand. Given the significant influx of foreigners coming to work or study in Australia in recent years, it seems highly likely that short-stay visitor movements may have added to the demand for housing. However, the Commissions are unaware of any research that quantifies the effects." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} a move for {{universities}} have tended to integrate teaching into [...] "systems-based teaching" [...] rather than [...] "subject-based teaching". [...] E.g. rather than studying separate distinct modules in anatomy, physiology, ethics, psychology and biochemistry, students study distinct modules in different body systems, e.g. [...] "heart and lungs" [...] or [...] "nervous system" [...] - during which they will study the anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, psychology, etc. relevant to that system. [...] The same also has happened with clinical subjects, so for example rather than studying [...] "medicine" [...] and [...] "surgery" [...] separately, <b>students</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> a [...] "heart" [...] module in which they study clinical cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery together. [...] In some medical schools there is integration of clinical and pre-clinical subjects together - e.g. a [...] "heart" [...] module would include anatomy of the heart, physiology of the heart, clinical examination, clinical cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery being studied in one module.|$|E

2500|$|Over the decades, Minnesota's Greek system, {{like others}} nationwide, {{has had its}} detractors. [...] Most notably in the late 1960s, anti-establishment {{agitation}} resulted in decreased interest and participation. This negative environment abated {{with the end of}} the Vietnam War. While membership again surged beginning in the late 1970s, the campus population was swelling even faster. While hitting numeric highs, Greeks at Minnesota thus never achieved the pre-Vietnam era participation level as a percentage of the campus. [...] For some, Greeks were [...] "too exclusive." [...] Commuting <b>students</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> had little occasion to socialize with them on the largely non-residential campus. Some students chafed at overt culture differences where Prep-era Greek men would wear blazers and ties to Monday meetings. Occasional surveys of detractors would declare a perception that membership was akin to buying friends. [...] For others, it was simply a monitory concern, with a reluctance to include fraternity or sorority dues into a tight college budget. The hugely popular movie, [...] "Animal House" [...] also branded for a generation the image of a lethargic, disruptive and academically inferior [...] "frat boy" [...] on the national consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} {{participation}} of Chinese student {{in an international}} student assessment test, the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment, 15-year-old students from Shanghai ranked first {{in all of the}} three categories: mathematics, science, and reading. The Chinese students scored particularly well compared to other nations in mathematics. One explanation for the Chinese results may be a culture emphasizing education and competitive examinations and more time spent studying in part due to less participation in activities such as sports. Teaching have become a higher status occupation. Also, industrialized Shanghai which has done important educational reforms may not be representative for the rest of China. While {{there was no evidence of}} cheating or technical problems with the testing, Shanghai which attracts many immigrants from the rest of China may have allowed particularly good students to study in the city and the <b>students</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been told that the test was important for China's image. The OECD director of the testing, Andreas Schleicher, said that the results were expected to produce astonishment and had been examined for accuracy by international experts after the OECD received the Shanghai scores. He also said that the results [...] "refute the commonly held hypothesis that China just produces rote learning" [...] and [...] "Large fractions of these students demonstrate their ability to extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge very creatively in novel situations".|$|E
