25|$|One {{study of}} Alpha Centauri, the nearest star {{system to the}} Sun, {{suggested}} that binaries need not be discounted {{in the search for}} habitable planets. Centauri A and B have an 11AU distance at closest approach (23AU mean), and both should have stable habitable zones. A study of long-term orbital stability for simulated planets within the system shows that planets within approximately threeAU of either star may remain rather stable (i.e. the semi-major axis deviating by less than 5% during 32000 binary periods). The HZ for Centauri A is conservatively estimated at 1.2 to 1.3AU and Centauri B at 0.73 to 0.74—well within the <b>stable</b> <b>region</b> in both cases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ontologies {{are heavily}} used in life {{sciences}} and evolve continuously to incorporate new or changed insights. Often ontology changes affect only specific parts (regions) of ontologies making it valuable for ontology users and applications {{to know the}} heavily changed regions {{on the one hand}} and <b>stable</b> <b>regions</b> on the other hand. However, the size and complexity of life science ontologies renders manual approaches to localize changing or <b>stable</b> <b>regions</b> impossible. We therefore propose an approach to automatically discover evolving or <b>stable</b> ontology <b>regions.</b> We evaluate the approach by studying evolving regions in the Gene Ontology and the NCI Thesaurus...|$|R

25|$|Whilst {{elements}} with atomic numbers {{expected for}} the island of stability have been produced, the total nucleon count of these nuclides has been too low. These synthesised nuclides have contained too few neutrons to reach the supposed <b>stable</b> <b>region.</b> It is possible that these elements possess unusual chemical properties and, if they have isotopes with adequate lifespans, would be available for various practical applications (such as particle accelerator targets and as neutron sources as well). In particular, the very small critical masses of transplutonic elements (possibly as small as grams) implies that if stable elements could be found, they would enable small and compact nuclear bombs either directly or by serving as primaries to help ignite fission/fusion secondaries; this possibility motivated much of the early research in the 1960s and multiple nuclear tests by the United States (including Operation Plowshare) and the Soviet Union aimed at producing such elements.|$|E

50|$|Similar to {{the process}} of {{selecting}} <b>stable</b> <b>regions</b> via thresholding in MSER, <b>stable</b> <b>regions</b> are selected across local scale changes. To achieve this, overlap error is computed across each triplet of consecutive scales. If the region overlap error is greater than 90%, only one region is kept.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} time delay {{effects on the}} {{stability}} and performance of active feedback control systems for engineering structures. A computer algorithm is developed for stability analysis of a SDOF system with unequal delay time pair in the velocity and displacement feedback loops. It is found that there may exist multiple <b>stable</b> <b>regions</b> in {{the plane of the}} time delay pair, which contain time delays greater than the maximum allowable values obtained by previous studies. The size, shape and location of these <b>stable</b> and unstable <b>regions</b> depend on the system parameters and the feedback control gains. For systems with multiple <b>stable</b> <b>regions,</b> the boundaries between the <b>stable</b> and unstable <b>regions</b> in the plane of the time delay pair are explicitly obtained. The delay time pairs that forms these boundaries are called the critical delay time pairs at which the steady-state response becomes unbounded. The conclusions are valid for both large and small delay times. For any system with multiple <b>stable</b> <b>regions,</b> preliminary guidelines obtained from an explicit formula are given to find the desirable delay time pair(s). When used, these desirable delay time pair(s) not only stabilize an unstable system with inherent time delays, but also significantly reduce the system response and control force. For any system with multiple <b>stable</b> <b>regions,</b> these desirable delay time pair(s) are above the maximum allowable delay times obtained by previous studies. Numerical results, for both steady-state and transient analysis, are given to investigate the performance of delayed feedback control systems subjected to both harmonic and real earthquake ground motion excitations...|$|R
2500|$|Seitz's {{opposition}} {{caused the}} proponents of nuclear winter to issue responses in the media. The proponents believed it was simply necessary to show only the possibility of climatic catastrophe, often a worst-case scenario, while opponents insisted that to be taken seriously, nuclear winter should be shown as likely under [...] "reasonable" [...] scenarios. One of these areas of contention, as elucidated by Lynn R. Anspaugh, is upon the question of which season should {{be used as the}} backdrop for the US-USSR war models, as most models choose the summer in the Northern Hemisphere as the start point to produce the maximum soot lofting and therefore eventual winter effect, whereas it has been pointed out that if the firestorms occurred in the autumn or winter months, when there is much less intense sunlight to loft soot into a <b>stable</b> <b>region</b> of the stratosphere, the magnitude of the cooling effect from the same number of firestorms as ignited in the summer models, would be negligible according to a January model run by Covey et al.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of computing numerical solutions for Ito stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The five-stage Milstein (FSM) methods are constructed for solving SDEs driven by an m-dimensional Wiener process. The FSM methods are fully explicit methods. It is proved that the FSM methods are convergent with strong order 1 for SDEs driven by an m-dimensional Wiener process. The analysis of stability (with multidimensional Wiener process) shows that the mean-square <b>stable</b> <b>regions</b> of the FSM methods are unbounded.
