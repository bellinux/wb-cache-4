40|$|Diagnostics, monitoring, {{and therapy}} Digital stethoscopes Digital stethoscopes Overview A stethoscope, whether {{acoustic}} or digital, is used mainly {{to listen to}} heart and lung sounds in the body {{as an aid to}} diagnosis. Listening, or auscultation, has been done with acoustic stethoscopes for almost two hundred years; recently, electronic digital stethoscopes have been developed. The goal of a basic digital stethoscope is to have it retain {{the look and feel of}} an acoustic stethoscope but to improve listening performance. In addition, high-end digital stethoscopes offer sophisticated capabilities such as audio recording and playback. They also provide data to visually chart results by connecting to an off-instrument display such as a computer monitor. This advanced functionality increases the physician’s diagnostic capability. Maintaining the existing acoustic stethoscope form (i. e., that “look and feel”) while improving the performance digitally requires the use of small, low-power solutions. Audio signal path The essential elements of a digital stethoscope are the <b>sound</b> <b>transducer,</b> the audio codec electronics, and the speakers. The <b>sound</b> <b>transducer,</b> which converts sound into an analog voltage, is the most critical piece in the chain. It determines the diagnostic quality of the digital stethoscope and ensures a familiar user experience to those accustomed to acoustic stethoscopes. The analog voltage needs to be conditioned and then converted into a digital signal using an audio analog-to-digital converter (ADC) or audio codec. Some digital stethoscopes have noise cancellation that requires a secondary <b>sound</b> <b>transducer</b> or microphone to record the ambient noise so that it can be removed digitally. In this approach, two audio ADCs are required...|$|E

40|$|The Overtone Fiddle {{is a new}} violin-family {{instrument}} that incorporates electronic sensors, integrated DSP, and physical actuation of the acoustic body.

40|$|Many {{people in}} the world suffer fromhearing loss. Inmost cases {{patients}} wear conventional hearing aids in order to improve their conversation abilities. Implantable hearing aids provide higher sound quality compared to traditional ones especially for people with severe hearing loss. However, due to the invasive implantation procedure not many implants are in use especially among old people. Therefore the Fraunhofer Institute forManufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA and clinical and technical partners investigate a new concept of a partly implantable hearing device: the round window implant. It allows the implantation of the system's components with a minimally-invasive procedure under local anaesthesia. The implantable <b>sound</b> <b>transducer</b> is one of the system's most important components. It transforms electrical hearing aid signals into amplified mechanical vibrations for the inner ear. Thus it is the main subject of the scientific examinations within this thesis. Based on the analysis of geometrical and audiological conditions at the implantation situs, an actuation concept for the <b>sound</b> <b>transducer</b> is described. A piezoelectric micro actuator with bending elements and a circular shape is capable of fulfilling the audiological requirements according to calculations of this work. Proper design of the actuator is essential in order to reach the specification. The design is based on mathematical models that have been derived in the main part of this thesis. They predict the actuator’s electromechanical behaviour as a function of excitation frequency and geometrical parameters. The latter part of the work describes realisation and characterisation of actuator prototypes and allows a concept evaluation as well as a verification of the electromechnical modeling. In general, the measurement results are consistent with the model. However, overall performance of the prototypes is slightly below the specified requirements, that are based on conservative assumptions. The last chapter describes future optimisation work regarding both the piezoelectric actuator as well as the overall concept of a round window implant. If this work is successful, a new innovative hearing device will be available with superior sound quality and a minimally invasive implantation procedure {{for the benefit of the}} patient...|$|E
