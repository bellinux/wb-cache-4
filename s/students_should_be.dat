5|$|For the 1920 season, Maryland {{played in}} the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SAIAA). Meanwhile, members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) were locked in a heated debate over whether first-year <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{eligible}} to play football. The larger schools, in general, were against the practice, and eventually the disagreement resulted in a schism within the SIAA. Eight teams from the SIAA split to form the Southern Conference: Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Kentucky, Mississippi State, and Tennessee. They were joined by six non-SIAA members: North Carolina, North Carolina State, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Washington & Lee, and Maryland. Maryland would remain within the Southern Conference {{for the next three}} decades.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{qualitative}} {{data can be}} used to strengthen quantitative research designs in general and intervention research designs (i.e., experimental, quasi-experimental) in particular. For example, in educational psychology, researchers could conduct a qualitative pilot study to determine which group of <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> selected for quantitative study by observing or interviewing different groups of students.|$|E
25|$|The Preuss {{curriculum}} is shaped around college preparatory course requirements known within the University of California and California State University system as A–G courses. Preuss also takes the pedagogical position that all <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{given the opportunity}} to take the same courses. As such, Preuss has an untracked curriculum that requires all students to attend the same college preparatory courses.|$|E

Newly {{appointed}} as Deputy Minister of Education in 1976, his instruction to implement the policy that black <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taught half in English, half in Afrikaans triggered the Soweto Riots. In 1978, he was chosen, {{over the heads of}} 12 ministers, as Leader of the National Party in the Transvaal, and, in 1979, he became Minister of State for Administration and of Statistics.|$|E

He raised the salaries of teachers by fifteen percent while the test scores of students in the city and the graduation rate rose as well. He opposes social promotion, stating that <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> promoted only when they are adequately prepared for the next grade level. He favors after-school programs to help students who are behind. As mayor, Bloomberg strengthened the cell-phone ban in schools.|$|E
25|$|Midas Touch elaborates on points made by Trump and Kiyosaki {{in their}} prior work Why We Want You to be Rich. The coauthors assert their ideas {{will lead to}} an uptick in the American economy. Trump and Kiyosaki lament the lack of {{financial}} literacy espoused in the U.S. education structure. They argue <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taught how to become business owners instead of learning how to go work for another company. Trump and Kiyosaki write that such students are instructed to achieve academic excellence through avoiding risk. They say those who do engage in risk will learn from their mistakes and be stronger for it.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish {{government}} oversees Muslim religious {{facilities and}} education through its Directorate of Religious Affairs, {{under the authority}} of the Prime Minister. The directorate regulates the operation of the country's 77,777 registered mosques and employs local and provincial imams (who are civil servants). Sunni imams are appointed and paid by the state. The Alevis pray in cemevleri (gathering places), which have no legal status as places of worship. However, the Kuşadası and Tunceli municipalities ruled in 2008 that Alevi cemevleri are places of worship. Three municipal councils recognised cemevleri as places of worship, granting them the same financial advantages as mosques. Administrative courts in Antalya, Ankara and Istanbul ruled that Alevi <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> exempted from attending the mandatory religion and ethics course, and a similar ruling by the Izmir administrative court was confirmed by the Council of State. In 2009 the state TV channel, TRT, announced its plan to air programs reflecting the interests of the Alevi minority.|$|E

500|$|An {{objection}} {{is often}} {{made in the}} teaching of evolution that evolution is controversial or contentious. [...] Unlike past creationist arguments which sought to abolish the teaching of evolution altogether, this argument makes the weaker claim that evolution should be presented alongside alternative views since it is controversial, and <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed to evaluate and choose between the options on their own.|$|E
500|$|While {{attending}} the Friedrichstadt Teacher College, Maeser {{was exposed to}} Pestalozzian educational theory, which greatly influenced his educational philosophy. Pestalozzian educational theory recognizes the potential of each individual. Pestalozzi encouraged teachers to treat their students with kindness and respect, and to show love to their students, instead of evoking fear. Pestalozzi was also in favor of universal education and opposed separately educating different social classes. Maeser adopted many of his ideas. He supported the education of women. Maeser believed that <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed to express themselves freely and choose their own careers. His lectures tried to engage students and help them understand concepts through their own experiences. He also included many object lessons to coach students to observe their surroundings and make connections. Maeser admired Prestalozzian teachers Adolph Diesterweg and Friedrich Fröbel Maeser also agreed that [...] "education should be balanced head, heart and hand." ...|$|E
500|$|Zahorchak was {{a steady}} {{supporter}} of Rendell's education proposals. However, he maintained {{that he could}} still be an independent voice within the administration, and claimed, [...] "I happen {{to agree with the}} outcomes because I'm in the mix of making determinations of our policy decisions." [...] In addition to Act 72, Zahorchak supported a Rendell proposal to require superintendents and principals in struggling school districts to improve math and reading test scores in order to keep their jobs, an idea that was not embraced by the Pennsylvania Legislature. In 2006, Zahorchak said he supported requiring high-school students to pass exit exams before they could graduate, although he acknowledged implementing such a testing program would be a long and difficult effort. At the time, the state required students to demonstrate proficiency in math and reading before they could graduate, but allowed local districts to decide whether that should entail passing the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment math and reading tests or alternative tests in the subjects. Zahorchak said, [...] "I think it's a real disservice to graduate a student who's fundamentally not at the standard level." [...] However, Zahorchak also said <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given alternative ways to demonstrate they are ready for college or the work force besides exams.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of new student orientation leaders at {{colleges and universities}} recognize that distinctive needs of <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> considered in regard to orientation information provided {{at the beginning of}} the higher education experience. [...] Research done by Whyte in 1986 raised the awareness of counselors and educators in this regard. [...] In 2007, the National Orientation Directors Association reprinted Cassandra B. Whyte's research report allowing readers to ascertain improvements made in addressing specific needs of students over a quarter of a century later to help with academic success.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{the company}} formed a {{publishing}} division called Big Ideas Learning which publishes textbooks {{at the middle}} and high school levels. [...] These textbooks follow the new curriculum and practices specified by the Common Core State Standards Initiative. [...] In addition to specifying a common curriculum in mathematics, the Common Core State Standards Initiative specifies eight Mathematical Practices that <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taught. [...] In keeping with this curriculum and practices, Larson has written a book titled Mathematical Practices, with examples of how teachers can implement the curriculum and practices in Grades K-8.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{adolescents}} in the United States receive some form of sex education at school at least once between grades 6 and 12; many schools begin addressing some topics as early as grades 4 or 5. Academic and other proponents of the National Sexuality Education Standards advocate {{that by the end}} of the fifth grade, <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to [...] "Define sexual orientation as the romantic attraction of an individual to someone of the same gender or a different gender." [...] However, what students learn varies widely, because curriculum decisions are so decentralized. Many states have laws governing what is taught in sex education classes or allowing parents to opt out. Some state laws leave curriculum decisions to individual school districts.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contemporary}} society, adolescents {{also face}} some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, {{are not necessarily}} inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose [...] "anything but intercourse" [...] for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it {{reduces the risk of}} STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21. Multrine also states in her article that according to a March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, eighty-one percent of parents want schools to discuss the use of condoms and contraception with their children. They also believe <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to be tested for STIs. Furthermore, teachers want to address such topics with their students. But, although 9 in 10 sex education instructors across the country believe that <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taught about contraceptives in school, over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so. According to anthropologist Margaret Mead, the turmoil found in adolescence in Western society has a cultural rather than a physical cause; they reported that societies where young women engaged in free sexual activity had no such adolescent turmoil.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, UB held a university-wide {{referendum}} {{that was}} open to students regarding two issues on Greiner's agenda, including privatization and differential tuition. Michael Pierce, the University Council Student Representative who penned the referendum, stated that the issue was not about confidence, or lack thereof, in Greiner, but that new directions he proposed should [...] "get a mandate from the university." [...] Greiner stated that <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> concerned about affordability and accessibility rather than whether or not one SUNY institution costs more to attend than another. [...] Of the 300 UB students who rallied about the issues on the UB Amherst Campus and who proceeded, en masse, to Greiner's office, the UB president stated that their actions were [...] "divisive," [...] that he was [...] "not moved," [...] {{and that they should}} register to vote in Erie County.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph {{attempted}} {{to pass the}} blame for events on to ... van Swieten. [...] As President of the Censorship Commission, [...] had been more liberal than Joseph was willing to countenance. ... As Minister for Education [...] had aimed to strip education of any religious character; he was {{more concerned about the}} dangers of religious orthodoxy than heresy, and believed that <b>students</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taught a system of secular values based upon 'philosophy'. [...] But his reforms, which indicated a far more radical rejection of religious education than Joseph was really prepared to accept, had failed. [...] In 1790, Joseph wrote to Chancellor Kolowrat expressing his discontent: [...] 'since an essential aspect of the education of young people, namely religion and morality, is treated far too lightly, since ... no feeling for one's true duties is being developed, the state is deprived of the essential advantages of having raised right-thinking and well-behaved citizens.' ...|$|E

40|$|A {{good student}} in a social studies {{classroom}} is one who thinks seriously about his/her work and seeks to find the reason behind the understanding of certain tasks. The <b>student</b> <b>should</b> aim at developing {{a wide range of}} skills to enable him/her to participate in discussions and make competent decisions. Educational programs should present various subjects and adopt an interdisciplinary approach to learning. The decisions that the student makes in society later in life will be complex and require different approaches. A good <b>student</b> <b>should</b> accept responsibility to participate fully in the school community and take part in activities that promote the welfare of others. A good {{student in a}} social studies classroom <b>should</b> <b>be</b> open-minded, inquisitive, creative, and respectful. The <b>student</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to challenge practices that contradict the principles of democracy.
