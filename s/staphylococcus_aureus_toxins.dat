40|$|Cocolonization {{of human}} mucosal {{surfaces}} causes frequent encounters between various staphylococcal species, creating {{opportunities for the}} horizontal acquisition of mobile genetic elements. The majority of <b>Staphylococcus</b> <b>aureus</b> <b>toxins</b> and virulence factors are encoded on S. aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs).

Although there have been reports of the production of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST- 1), enterotoxin, and other superantigens by coagulase-negative staphylococci, no associated pathogenicity islands have been found in the genome of Staphylococcus epidermidis, a generally less virulent relative of S. aureus. We show here the first evidence of a composite S. epidermidis pathogenicity island (SePI), the product of multiple insertions in the genome of a clinical isolate.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} : DNA {{methylation}} is an epigenetic mechanism {{that has been}} implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases by regulating differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and activation of immune cells. Changes in the methylation status of relevant genes {{have been linked to}} the origin, perpetuation, and severity of airway diseases. The DNA methylation profile can be also modified by the action of viral and bacterial colonization. Bacteria and specially <b>Staphylococcus</b> <b>aureus</b> <b>toxins</b> are recognized inflammatory amplifying factors in both lower and upper airway chronic diseases. This review summarizes the existent knowledge about the role of DNA methylation changes in chronic airway diseases and the contribution of bacterial infection on this event. Recent findings : It has been demonstrated that changes in DNA methylation, either intrinsic or induced by allergen or infection, may be linked to the pathogenesis of asthma and allergy. These changes in methylation may suppress the production of anti-inflammatory mediators and increase the survival and activation of pro-inflammatory cells, as well as modify the immune response in response to bacterial infection, increasing their survival and pathogenicity within the infected organism. Summary : Understanding the intrinsic epigenetic mechanisms, as well as the effect of environment - for example, bacterial infection in the pathogenesis of airways diseases - will greatly improve the management and the diagnosis of these diseases...|$|E

40|$|Introduction <b>Staphylococcus</b> <b>aureus</b> <b>toxins</b> are {{implicated in}} {{sudden infant death}} {{syndrome}} (SIDS) as there is an inverse relationship between incidence and circulating anti-toxin levels. A recent retrospective review of autopsy reports found that S. aureus was isolated more commonly from cases of SIDS compared to an explained non-infection group. Another study detected the toxins in tissues of over 50 % of cases from three different countries. However, these toxins could be due to contamination at sampling. We have hypothesised that toxins not neutralised by IgG will be eliminated to the urine and detected. Here we demonstrate a temperature dependant pattern of secretion which does not support contamination as a source of toxins. Methods TSST- 1 and SEB producing strains of S. aureus were cultured for 24 h at 41 °C, 37 °C, 30 °C, 22 °C or 4 °C in either Brain Heart Infusion broth (BHI) or clean catch mid-stream urine. The OD 600 of the suspensions were measured prior to centrifugation at 900 g. Toxin levels in the resulting media supernatants were determined by ELISA, gel electrophoresis and western blotting (WB). Results Maximum bacterial growth was observed at 30 °C and 37 °C while it was diminished at 22 °C and 41 °C and undetectable at 4 °C. In contrast, maximal TSST- 1 release occurred at 41 °C (0. 10 µg/ml) with less at 37 °C (0. 052 µg/ml), while at 4 °C, 22 °C and 30 °C TSST- 1 was undetectable. Similar results were obtained for SEB. Conclusions Contamination of urine samples stored at room or refrigerated temperature does not result in the release of biologically significant levels of toxin. These results support the interpretation of our previous findings that the detection of S. aureus toxins in infant urine results from a transient bacteraemia rather than contamination. ELISA and WB for bacterial toxins in body fluids taken at autopsy can be used to distinguish between genuine infection with S. aureus and contamination...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that lethal toxins of bacteria associated with {{sudden infant death syndrome}} (SIDS) can act synergistically. METHODS: Bacteria occurring together in the nasopharynx of cases of cot death were studied. The lethal toxicity of crude toxin preparations was determined over a range of dilutions by injections into the chorioallantoic vein of the chick embryo. Toxin preparations of low lethality for the chick embryo SIDS model were then tested in combination. RESULTS: <b>Staphylococcus</b> <b>aureus</b> <b>toxin</b> preparations showed low lethality when tested alone, even at low dilution. At 1 in 100 dilution S <b>aureus</b> <b>toxin</b> was lethal to one out of 15 chick embryos. Escherichia coli toxin preparations showed high lethality except on high dilution (1 in 80) when lethality fell to two out of 15 of chick embryos. When the same toxin preparations were tested simultaneously in combination, lethality rose to 14 out of 15. Similar findings were observed over a range of toxin dilutions. This finding was highly significant (p = 0. 0012). CONCLUSIONS: That synergy between toxins can enhance the lethality of toxins elaborated by bacteria associated with SIDS...|$|R

40|$|Alpha toxin {{production}} {{and its relationship}} to cell growth were studied in the Wood 46 strain of <b>Staphylococcus</b> <b>aureus.</b> <b>Toxin</b> first appeared in the culture in the late logarithmic stage, but at least 80 % was produced during the subsequent period of slower cell growth.

The possibility that alpha toxin is released as a result of cell lysis was examined by using the appearance of cellular deoxyribonucleic acid in the medium as an indicator of lysis. The results showed that no appreciable amount of lysis occurred during toxin production; at a time when almost maximum amounts of toxin were present in the culture, less than% 4 of the cells had lysed.

40|$|Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are {{important}} nosocomial pathogens and {{the leading cause}} of sepsis. The second most frequently implicated species, after Staphylococcus epidermidis, is Staphylococcus haemolyticus. However, we have a significant lack of knowledge about what causes virulence of S. haemolyticus, as virulence factors of this pathogen have remained virtually unexplored. In contrast to the aggressive pathogen <b>Staphylococcus</b> <b>aureus,</b> <b>toxin</b> production has traditionally not been associated with CoNS. Recent findings have suggested that phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), amphipathic peptide toxins with broad cytolytic activity, are widespread in staphylococci, but there has been no systematic assessment of PSM production in CoNS other than S. epidermidis. Here, we identified, purified, and characterized PSMs of S. haemolyticus. We found three PSMs of the β-type, which correspond to peptides that before were described to have anti-gonococcal activity. We also detected an α-type PSM that has not previously been described. Furthermore, we confirmed that S. haemolyticus does not produce a δ-toxin, as results from genome sequencing had indicated. All four S. haemolyticus PSMs had strong pro-inflammatory activity, promoting neutrophil chemotaxis. Notably, we identified in particular the novel α-type PSM, S. haemolyticus PSMα, as a potent hemolysin and leukocidin.

40|$|The {{role of the}} pore-forming <b>Staphylococcus</b> <b>aureus</b> <b>toxin</b> Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) {{in severe}} necrotizing {{diseases}} is debated due to conflicting data from epidemiological studies of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) infections and various murine disease-models. In this study, we used neutrophils isolated from different species to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of PVL in comparison to other staphylococcal cytolytic components. Furthermore, to study the impact of PVL we expressed it heterologously in a non-virulent staphylococcal species and examined pvl-positive and pvl-negative clinical isolates {{as well as the}} strain USA 300 and its pvl-negative mutant. We demonstrate that PVL induces rapid activation and cell death in human and rabbit neutrophils, but not in murine or simian cells. By contrast, the phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), a newly identified group of cytolytic staphylococcal components, lack species-specificity. In general, after phagocytosis of bacteria different pvl-positive and pvl-negative staphylococcal strains, expressing a variety of other virulence factors (such as surface proteins), induced cell death in neutrophils, which is most likely associated with the physiological clearing function of these cells. However, the release of PVL by staphylococcal strains caused rapid and premature cell death, which is different from the physiological (and programmed) cell death of neutrophils following phagocytosis and degradation of virulent bacteria. Taken together, our results question the value of infection-models in mice and non-human primates to elucidate the impact of PVL. Our data clearly demonstrate that PVL acts differentially o...|$|R

40|$|<b>Staphylococcus</b> <b>aureus</b> <b>toxin</b> {{formation}} in hydrated batter mixes can cause consumer illness. This toxin {{in particular is}} a concern because the toxin cannot be destroyed by heating steps that may be performed by the processor or the consumer. Pathogens other than S. aureus are, in many cases, less likely to grow in hydrated batter mixes, {{and are likely to}} be killed by the heating steps that follow (FDA, 2011). Control Measures S. aureus can enter the process on raw materials. It can also be introduced into foods during processing from unclean hands and insanitary utensils and equipment. The hazard develops when a batter mix is exposed to temperatures favorable for S. aureus growth for sufficient time to permit <b>toxin</b> development. S. <b>aureus</b> <b>toxin</b> does not normally reach levels that will cause food poisoning until the numbers of the pathogen reach 500, 000 to 1, 000, 000 /gram. S. aureus will grow at temperatures as low as 44. 6 °F (7 °C) and at a water activity as low as 0. 83 (additional information on conditions favorable to S. aureus growth are provided in Table A- 1. However, toxin formation is not likely at temperatures lower than 50 °F (10 °C) or at water activity below 0. 85. For this reason, toxin formation can be controlled by minimizing exposure of hydrated batter mixes to temperatures above 50 °F (10 °C). Exposure times greater than 12 hours for temperatures between 50 °F (10 °C) and 70 °F (21. 1 °C) could result in toxin formation. Exposure times greater than 3 hours for temperatures above 70 °F (21. 1 °C) could also result in toxin formation (FDA, 2011) FDA Guidelines � Hydrated batter mix temperatures should not exceed 10 ºC (50 °F) for more than 12 h, cumulatively; and � Hydrated batter mix temperatures should not exceed 21. 1 ºC (70 °F) for more than 3 h, cumulatively (FDA, 2011) ...|$|R

In our unit, CONS colonized the bowels of most infants studied, including 46 % of 70 NEC cases (mean concentration, 10 (9. 1) CFU/g of stool). Over 90 % of tested isolates produced a hemolysin resembling delta <b>toxin</b> of <b>Staphylococcus</b> <b>aureus.</b> <b>Toxin</b> purified from a NEC-associated isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis resembled reference delta <b>toxin</b> from S. <b>aureus</b> in size, biologic properties, and antigenicity. This delta-like toxin was enteropathic, causing mucosal necrosis and hemorrhage in injected loops of the bowels of infant rats. Adjacent, nonexposed bowel remained normal, as did loops injected with lecithin-neutralized toxin. Using a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we detected delta-like toxin in the stools of 11 of 35 infants colonized with CONS positive for delta-like toxin (Tox+). Positive tests were strongly associated with NEC. Of 18 cases with Tox+ CONS, 10 were positive (56 %), whereas only 1 of 17 control infants so colonized was positive (6 %, P = 0. 002). In NEC patients, the mean fecal toxin concentration was 1, 012 ng/g.

Methods: In the present cross-sectional study, 89 isolates were collected from blood samples and detected as <b>Staphylococcus</b> <b>aureus</b> during the period of 6 months at Ali Ebne AbiTaleb Hospital, Zahedan, Iran. Initially, the case study examples were examined by biochemical tests. Then, based on recognized standards, <b>Staphylococcus</b> <b>aureus</b> isolates were isolated.

Subsequently, the antibiotic susceptibility of all isolates to methicillin was determined using Cefoxitin(30 µg) disk diffusion and agar screening methods. Finally, the PCR method was used to determine PVL and mecA genes. All results were analyzed by the Chi-square test. Results: Out of the total 89 isolates of <b>Staphylococcus</b> <b>aureus</b> blood isolates, 26 isolates from wounds and 63 were isolated. Most samples were obtained from female patients. According to the molecular analysis, 47 isolates (82 / 52 %) were mecA gene and resistant to methicillin and 42 strains (47 / 2 %) was methicillin-sensitive. Resistance to vancomycin wasn’t observed in isolates. Erythromycin and Penicillin had the highest prevalence of antibiotic resistance among isolates, respectively.
