25|$|Steering angles {{are also}} crucial {{as the driver}} progresses. The first stage of these {{modifications}} is usually a modified <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle</b> or upright. Extended control arms can be employed on MacPherson strut vehicles like the Nissan S-Chassis, as to allow for more clearance for higher steering angles. Companies like Wisefab, IRP (Individual Racing Parts), Voodoo13, and Parts Shop MAX have developed full lock kits including modification of the vehicle's original scrub radius, kingpin axis, Ackermann angle, amount of bump steer, caster angle, and kinematics as to maximize front grip and eliminate mechanical bind at steering angles in excess of 60°. While MacPherson strut vehicles are prevalent in profession drifting, Double wishbone suspension vehicles can also be competitive, with often better caster and camber curves.|$|E
2500|$|The 370Z uses a front double {{wishbone}} suspension, with forged aluminum control arms and <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle,</b> the rear multi-link suspension uses a forged aluminum upper control arm, lower arm and radius rod, the toe control rod is steel and wheel carrier assembly is aluminum. [...] The refreshed 2013 model uses new dampers with the Sport package models. The brakes {{have been changed}} from the more expensive Brembo racing brakes to Nissan branded brakes which are manufactured by Akebono.|$|E
50|$|In {{automotive}} suspension, a <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle</b> is {{that part}} which contains the wheel hub or spindle, and attaches to the suspension components. It is variously called a <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle,</b> spindle, upright or hub, as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Steering</b> <b>knuckles</b> {{and the top}} wishbone/bell crank {{are also}} {{specially}} manufactured in an aluminium alloy. The wishbones are machined from a solid aluminium alloy with CNC machines.|$|R
5000|$|In an automobile, {{ball joints}} are spherical {{bearings}} that connect the control {{arms to the}} <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles.</b> They are used on virtually every automobile made [...] and work similarly to the ball-and-socket design of the human hip joint.|$|R
50|$|<b>Steering</b> <b>knuckles</b> come in {{all shapes}} and sizes. Their designs differ to fit all sorts of {{applications}} and suspension types. However, they can be divided into two main types. One comes with a hub and the other comes with a spindle.|$|R
50|$|He {{continued}} to race and in November 1911, in Columbia, South Carolina, he struck a fence {{due to a}} broken <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle.</b> He {{was in the hospital}} for several months, and his right leg was amputated, which ended his racing career.|$|E
5000|$|TfL {{approved}} seating {{access and}} controls. To meet the famed turning circle requirements of only 25 ft, {{defined by the}} width of the roundabout at the Savoy Hotel, Nissan further: modified front suspension with a separate <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle</b> connected via swivel bearings ...|$|E
50|$|Unlike a kingpin, which {{requires}} an assembly {{in the center}} of the wheel in order to pivot, joints connect to the upper and lower end of the spindle (<b>steering</b> <b>knuckle),</b> to the control arms. This leaves the center section open to allow the use of front-wheel drive. Older kingpin designs can only be used in a rear-wheel-drive configuration.|$|E
5000|$|... 2004 MY - The new 2.3 L I4 Duratec engine {{previously}} {{only available}} in select states became available nationwide, ZX3 now available with leather seating surfaces, new <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles</b> and struts for improved ride and handling, discontinuation of optional electronic stability control.|$|R
50|$|Front suspension: {{upper and}} lower {{transverse}} leaf springs, curved downward to raise roll centre. Generous ground clearance and travel. No antisway bar, {{which resulted in the}} lifting of one rear wheel in hard cornering. Kingpins integral with the <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles,</b> turning in sockets pivoted on the leaf spring eyes.|$|R
2500|$|The front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} MacPherson struts, with six-cylinder cars using an aluminium front subframe. Aluminium {{is used for}} the <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles,</b> outer strut tube and the spring pads, resulting in a weight saving of [...] V8 models also use aluminium in the steering box and several suspension links, to compensate for the heavier steel subframe.|$|R
50|$|The 1978 Fleetwood Brougham {{was built}} as body on frame construction. It used a ladder type frame with welded cross members. The front {{suspension}} used the traditional {{upper and lower}} control arms, integral <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle,</b> arm and caliper support, integral hubs and rotors on spindles, tapered roller bearings with spherical joint, independent coil springs, link-type stabilizer bar, and hydraulic Direct Action shock absorbers.|$|E
5000|$|... 1968-1974 GM X-bodies {{positioned}} {{the steering}} linkage behind the steering gear ("rear steer" [...] - also {{shared with the}} 1967-69 F platform), whereas 1975-1979 models had the steering linkage forward of the steering gear ("front steer" [...] - shared with the second generation (1970-81) F platform including the 1973-77 A platform and 1977-96 B platform (control arms, <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle</b> assembly except steering linkage and front sway bar).|$|E

50|$|Basically any forgeable {{metal can}} also be forge-rolled. Forge rolling is mainly used to preform long-scaled billets through {{targeted}} mass distribution for parts such as crankshafts, connection rods, <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles</b> and vehicle axles. Narrowest manufacturing tolerances can only partially be achieved by forge rolling. This {{is the main reason}} why forge rolling is rarely used for finishing, but mainly for preforming.|$|R
50|$|Citroën {{invested}} enormous {{resources to}} design and launch an entirely new vehicle in 1970, the SM, which was in effect a thoroughly modernized DS, with similar length, but greater width. The manual gearbox was a modified DS unit. The front disc brakes were the same design. Axles, wheel bearings, <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles,</b> and hydraulic components were either DS parts or modified DS parts.|$|R
50|$|MacPherson strut {{equipped}} vehicles {{usually have}} a negative scrub radius. Even though scrub radius in itself is not directly adjustable, it will be changed if the upper steering axis point or spindle angle is changed when adjusting camber. This is the case on a MacPherson strut which has the camber adjustment at the <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle.</b> Because camber is usually kept within 1/4° side to side, the resulting scrub radius difference is negligible.|$|E
5000|$|The 370Z uses a front double {{wishbone}} suspension, with forged aluminum control arms and <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle,</b> the rear multi-link suspension uses a forged aluminum upper control arm, lower arm and radius rod, the toe control rod is steel and wheel carrier assembly is aluminum. [...] The refreshed 2013 model uses new dampers with the Sport package models. The brakes {{have been changed}} from the more expensive Brembo racing brakes to Nissan branded brakes which are manufactured by Akebono.|$|E
50|$|A {{ball joint}} {{consists}} of a bearing stud and socket enclosed in a casing; all these parts are made of steel. The bearing stud is tapered and threaded, and fits into a tapered hole in the <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle.</b> A protective encasing prevents dirt from getting into the joint assembly. Usually, this is a rubber-like boot that allows movement and expansion of lubricant. Motion-control ball joints tend to be retained with an internal spring, which helps to prevent vibration problems in the linkage.|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} is that torsion bars, unlike coil springs, usually cannot {{provide a}} progressive spring rate. In most torsion bar systems, ride height (and therefore many handling features) may {{be changed by}} simply adjusting bolts that connect the torsion bars to the <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles.</b> In most cars {{with this type of}} suspension, swapping torsion bars for a different spring rate is usually an easy task.|$|R
50|$|The General Motors Central Foundry Division (GM-CFD) {{had applied}} DDM {{to the design}} of {{castings}} and tooling for automotive components such as engine blocks, cylinder heads and <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles.</b> DDM was run on Calma's proprietary dual monitor workstation hardware connected to Data General Nova and later Digital VAX 11/780-series computers. GM-CFD had DDM installations in Saginaw, MI, Pontiac, MI, Defiance, OH, Bedford, IN, Danville, IL and Massena, NY.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} double-wishbone front suspension {{was replaced}} with a dual joint multilink design, with an all-electric system. To increase rigidity and lower unsprung weight, forged aluminum is now used for the suspension links, front <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles,</b> and rear hub carriers. along with a single-piece hollow die-cast aluminum front subframe with machined mounting points, and {{approximately half of the}} body uses high-tensile steel. Overall the amount of laser welding has been doubled compared to the previous model.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the chassis}} {{components}} {{were the same}} as the first generation (the A-frames {{between the first and second}} generation were the same although they were originally sourced from GM's G-body vehicle lineup), along with the <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle,</b> leaf springs, and differential assembly but suspension and axles were greatly enhanced. Lower A-frames for the 2WD had 1/4 inch thicker steering stops - the second generation A-frames are commonly used as an upgrade for the first generation. Utility models (Blazer, Jimmy, Bravada) came with thicker front and rear sway bars.|$|E
50|$|Attrition took a huge toll on {{the field}} in the first 75 laps. Peter DePaolo dropped out with a broken <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle,</b> and Babe Stapp {{suffered}} a broken universal joint. By lap 65, seven of the top ten qualifiers were out - including all of the top five qualifiers. Jules Moriceau crashed in turn three after completing 30 laps. He spun around four times, hitting the wall each time, then bounced back across the track. The car came to rest pointing forward, and was towed back to the pits. Moriceau was not injured, and walked back to the pits planning to drive relief.|$|E

50|$|The K-44 {{features}} a driven double reduction front axle incorporating an interlockable differential. The <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles</b> are attached via bevel roller bearings, while the {{front drive shaft}} uses homokinetic joints. The wheel hubs incorporates planetary gears, which permits a higher ground clearance through {{the inclusion of a}} small differential unit. The front suspension uses 3.5 in wide by 1500 mm long leaf springs and telescopic shock absorbers. The wheel size is 8.0-20", and each wheel is held in place with ten nuts.|$|R
2500|$|The {{underside}} of the door handles were slightly recontoured to minimize slipping fingers when the handles are pulled. Seat belt release buttons were moved {{from the face of}} the buckle to the end for improved convenience. An electronic compass was added to the inside rear-view mirror. Larger front brakes came along with cast aluminum front control arms and <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles.</b> The rear ashtray assembly was changed from a click-lock face to a pull-up face. Finally, the spare tire cover and jack cradle assembly was changed from the jack and cover being bolted down to one where the jack sat in a plastic [...] "bucket" [...] inside the spare with the cover simply placed on top.|$|R
40|$|Verification {{of vehicle}} {{components}} {{with respect to}} fatigue is discussed. The two most common methods, i. e. the safety factor approach and the load-strength method are studied. A set of problems with the methods is identified. An alternative using {{the advantages of the}} two techniques is developed. This combined approach uses a signal-to-noise ratio, which can be related to classical safety factors. It is then possible to evaluate the performance based on probability theory as well as updating in a rational way when new observations are obtained. Assumptions of the distribution tails are not necessary, but can be replaced by a rough judgement based on experience and field failure statistics. A set of measurements on <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles</b> is used to exemplify the method...|$|R
5000|$|Sterling Elliott (1852-1922) {{produced}} {{a series of}} successful inventions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He held more than 125 patents, receiving his first at age 22. He was foremost an Inventor but also a successful businessman. His tenacity and determination to improve on everyday objects helped {{enhance the quality of}} life for established businesses, as well as the average person. His inventive mind and creative genius developed the first Knot Tying machine (No.237,966 [...] ), the low wheeled trotting sulky (No.494,113), the Elliott addressing machine (No.707,961), the pneumatic tire (No.487,874), the ball bearing (No. 483,836) and last but not least the unequal turning of the front wheels or <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle</b> (i.e.- kingpin) that would turn out to be a critical element in the success of the automobile.|$|E
50|$|When {{selecting}} aftermarket wheels, a {{wheel with}} too little positive offset will {{be closer to}} edge of the fender, and one with too much positive offset will tuck inside the fender and {{be closer to the}} suspension components. Wheel width, offset and tire size all determine the way a particular wheel/tire combination will work on a given car. Offset also affects the scrub radius of the steering and it is advisable to stay within the limits allowed by the vehicle manufacturer. Because wheel offset changes the lever-arm length between the center of the tire and the centerline of the <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle,</b> the way bumps, road imperfections and acceleration and braking forces are translated to steering torques (bump-steer, torque-steer, etc.) will change depending on wheel offset. Likewise, the wheel bearings will see increased thrust loads if the wheel centerline is moved away from the bearing centerline.|$|E
50|$|For 1974, North American models {{received}} newly required 5 mph impact bumpers {{mounted on}} self-restoring energy absorbers, which added approximately 25 mm to the car's overall length. On the Super Beetle, the <b>steering</b> <b>knuckle,</b> and consequently the lower attachment {{point of the}} strut, was redesigned to improve handling {{and stability in the}} event of a tire blowout. A limited-edition Big Beetle was introduced based on the 1303 LS. Available in unique metallic paint colors, the car featured styled-steel 5.5 in wide sport wheels wrapped in 175/70-15 tires, corduroy seat inserts, upgraded loop-pile carpet, wood-look instrument panel trim and a padded steering wheel with bright accents. In the North American market, a limited-edition Sun Bug was introduced as a standard Beetle or Super Beetle. Both were finished in metallic gold and featured styled-steel 4.5 in-wide sport wheels. Inside were brown corduroy and leatherette seats, loop-pile carpet, and padded four-spoke deluxe steering wheel. The Super Beetle Sun Bug included a sliding-steel sunroof.|$|E
50|$|The Fay {{automatic}} lathe was an {{automatic lathe}} tailored to cutting workpieces that were mounted on centers (tools with pointed ends to accurately position a center-drilled workpiece about an axis, {{either directly or}} by using a mandrel). It could also do chucking work (feeding of unformed blanks or pieces of stock from a magazine to be automatically gripped by the machine for turning). Examples of workpieces included automotive <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles</b> and transmission gears, and such work done on mandrels as flanges, disks, and hubs. The machine tool was developed by F.C. Fay of Philadelphia and improved by Otto A. Schaum. It was originally manufactured by the Fay & Scott Machine Shop. James Hartness acquired manufacturing rights {{on behalf of the}} Jones & Lamson Machine Company and manufactured an improved version, developed under the management of Ralph Flanders.|$|R
50|$|Like the VW Typ 166, the Typ 87 has a {{modified}} KdF-Wagen chassis. The backbone tube was increased in diameter {{to hold the}} additional cardan shaft for the front wheel drive. The <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles</b> were modified for the drive shaft. A worm and sector steering is used. The rear axle is equipped with reduction gears, both front and rear axle differentials are lockable. A single disc dry clutch transmits the torque from the engine to the manual four-speed gearbox which is equipped with an additional offroad gear. The offroad gear is activated with a lever, {{as well as the}} front wheel drive. With activated front wheel drive, the top speed is 10 km/h and the maximum slope climbing angle is 33,75°. The Typ 87 is powered by an air-cooled flat-four-cylinder-otto engine with a displacement of 1131 cm3 and a rated power of 18 kW.|$|R
50|$|During that time, SVE {{became known}} as Performance Vehicle Operations (PVO). The PVO group was {{responsible}} for developing the concept car into a production car. A turbocharged 2.4 liter inline-4 gasoline engine (A853 engine) was used. This engine was nearly identical to the 2003 Chrysler PT Cruiser (A855 engine), except the SRT-4 {{did not have the}} unique intake manifold required to fit the engine into the PT Cruiser engine bay. The car was then given a New Venture Gear T-850 five-speed manual transmission (based on the unit from the European turbodiesel minivans), equal-length half shafts, and a high capacity Sachs performance clutch. The suspension had stiffer springs, SRT-tuned Tokico struts (with travel reduced to provide clearance for the larger wheels), and larger front and rear sway bars were added. A unique steering gear, PT Cruiser <b>steering</b> <b>knuckles,</b> and an updated K member were also incorporated. Front brakes used 11.0 in (280 mm) vented disc brakes with extra thick rotors to prevent warping, and 10.6 in (270 mm) non-vented disc brakes in the rear, with single piston calipers (57mm front, 36mm rear).|$|R
