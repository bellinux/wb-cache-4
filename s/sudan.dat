5|$|Francis Piol Bol Bok (born February 1979), a Dinka tribesman {{and native}} of South <b>Sudan,</b> {{was a slave}} for ten years but is now an {{abolitionist}} and author living in the United States. On May 15, 1986, he was captured and enslaved {{at the age of}} seven during an Arab militia raid on the village of Nyamlel in South <b>Sudan</b> during the Second Sudanese Civil War. Bok lived in bondage for ten years before escaping imprisonment in Kurdufan, <b>Sudan,</b> followed by a journey to the United States by way of Cairo, Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Inside the <b>Sudan,</b> {{religion}} {{is an issue}} with growing the game. Most footballers wanting to play are required to wear the hijab and play while fully covered. While football was organised inside the country with 440 men's clubs in 2006, and the first ever women's game being played {{in the country that}} year in February between Tahadi and <b>Sudan</b> University at Sports’ City, <b>Sudan</b> University, development was hindered because a fatwa by the Fiqh Council of Islamic in 2006 condemning the creation of a women's league in <b>Sudan.</b> Still, in the South <b>Sudan</b> in 2006, the local government was indicating their support of women's football. By 2009, women's football programmes had been established in the <b>Sudan.</b> That year, there were ten senior women's teams, a school-based competition and a regional competition established. Young girls informally play the game in refugee camps in the Darfur region. Rights to broadcast the 2011 Women's World Cup in the country were bought by Al Jazeera.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{conceivable}} that any future {{members of the}} Commonwealth such as applicants (for example South <b>Sudan,</b> <b>Sudan</b> and Yemen) may participate in future games. The Colony of Aden and Federation of South Arabia, precursors to modern Yemen, participated before in 1962 and in 1966. <b>Sudan</b> was an Anglo-Egyptian protectorate until independence in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1985 {{the forces}} of the <b>Sudan</b> People's Liberation Army (SPLA) {{received}} a setback at the village of Gut-Makur near Mongalla when they were confronted by well-armed Mandari people.

5|$|South <b>Sudan</b> gained its {{independence}} from <b>Sudan</b> in 2011, but the South Sudanese Civil War {{made it difficult for}} the nation to garner the support of five sport federations as required for its National Olympic Committee to gain recognition by the International Olympic Committee. Guor Marial, a South Sudanese refugee living in the United States, competed in the men's marathon at the 2012 Summer Olympics, but did so as an Independent Olympic Athlete after refusing to compete for <b>Sudan.</b> South <b>Sudan</b> became the 206th IOC member in August 2015, with the affiliations of track and field, basketball, association football, handball, judo, table tennis, and taekwondo. The nation chose Marial at its flagbearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The British had ceded {{some power}} in Egypt with the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1922 {{and more in}} the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. The 1936 treaty was {{designed}} to counter Benito Mussolini's ambition to link Libya to Ethiopia via <b>Sudan</b> in a new Italian empire. The treaty recognized Egyptian claims of sovereignty in <b>Sudan</b> in return for British rights in the Nile valley and the Suez Canal. It allowed for unrestricted immigration of Egyptians to <b>Sudan</b> and {{for the return of}} Egyptian troops. The Sudanese were not consulted.|$|E
5|$|The final between Zambia and <b>Sudan</b> {{finished}} 0–0 after extra time, but Zambia won on penalties. Although Zambia won the final, {{the trophy}} {{was awarded to}} <b>Sudan,</b> who Zambia beat in the final.

5|$|Abd al-Rahman's son Sayyid al-Siddiq al-Mahdi was Imam of the Ansar for {{the next}} two years. After al-Siddiq's death in 1961 he was succeeded as imam by his brother Sayyid al-Hadi al-Mahdi, while al-Siddiq's son Sadiq al-Mahdi took over the {{leadership}} of the Umma party. Sadiq Al-Mahdi was arrested in 1970, and for many years alternated between spells in prison in <b>Sudan</b> and periods of exile. In 1985 Sadiq al-Mahdi was again elected president of the Umma party. In the 1986 elections he became Prime Minister of <b>Sudan,</b> holding office until the government was overthrown in 1989. After further imprisonment and exile, Sadiq al-Mahdi returned to <b>Sudan</b> in 2000 and in 2002 was elected Imam of the Ansar. In 2003 Sadiq Al-Mahdi was re-elected President of Umma.|$|E
5|$|Amin began {{recruiting}} {{members of}} Kakwa, Lugbara, South Sudanese, and {{other ethnic groups}} from the West Nile area bordering South <b>Sudan.</b> The South Sudanese had been residents in Uganda since the early 20th century, having come from South <b>Sudan</b> to serve the colonial army. Many African ethnic groups in northern Uganda inhabit both Uganda and South Sudan; allegations persist that Amin's army consisted mainly of South Sudanese soldiers.|$|E
5|$|As for King Leopold II's {{original}} {{designs for}} turning the expedition into a campaign into <b>Sudan,</b> the mutiny of Baron Dhanis' column had severely reduced the expedition's fighting power and {{made such a}} campaign impossible. Instead, Leopold's conquest of the Lado Enclave pleased the British government, at least initially, which welcomed any aid in their ongoing war with Mahdist <b>Sudan.</b> But frequent raids outside of Lado territory by Belgian forces based in Rejaf caused alarm and suspicion among British and French officials wary of Leopold's imperial ambitions. In 1910, {{following the death of}} the Belgian King in December 1909, British authorities reclaimed the Lado Enclave as per the Anglo-Congolese treaty signed in 1894, and added the territory to Anglo-Egyptian <b>Sudan.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cytochemical {{stains on}} blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the {{distinction}} of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a myeloperoxidase or <b>Sudan</b> black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or <b>Sudan</b> black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{independence}} was limited severely by the continuing British {{occupation of the}} country. British influence remained pervasive, {{as evidenced by the}} Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which almost led to Farouk I's forced abdication. In October 1951, Prime Minister Mustafa el-Nahhas introduced, and Parliament approved, decrees unilaterally abrogating the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and proclaiming Farouk I King of Egypt and the <b>Sudan.</b> The move was intended to further Egypt's claims over <b>Sudan,</b> which had been governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium since 1899.|$|E

5|$|In August 1954 Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{sponsored}} {{a tour of}} the south by Buth Diu of the Southern Liberal Party. In his speeches Buth Diu quoted NUP campaign promises supporting a Federal system in which the southern provinces would have considerable autonomy. Prime minister Azhari described this as seditious talk and threatened to use force to prevent secession from <b>Sudan</b> by the south. In May 1955 Isma'il al-Azhari announced that <b>Sudan</b> would seek complete independence, a reversal of the earlier NUP position in favor of union with Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, {{both of which were}} unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and <b>Sudan,</b> targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in <b>Sudan,</b> which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 1924, the Governor of <b>Sudan</b> Sir Lee Stack {{was shot}} and assassinated while driving through Cairo. The British responded with anger, {{demanding}} of the Egyptian government a public apology, an inquiry, suppression of demonstrations and payment of a large fine. Further, they demanded withdrawal of all Egyptian officers and Egyptian army units from the <b>Sudan,</b> an increase to the scope of an irrigation scheme in Gezira and laws to protect foreign investors in Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Since 1888, when Mahdist rebels {{forced the}} {{evacuation}} of then governor Emin Pasha, the Lado Enclave had been occupied by rebels {{under the leadership of}} Emir Arabi Dafalla. Rejaf was their strongest fortified position in the area, and it was there Arabi Dafalla stationed his equipment and soldiers. The establishment of Mahdist <b>Sudan</b> had provided the context for European powers to commence the invasion and colonization of the <b>Sudan,</b> in which King Leopold desperately wanted to take part in order to expand his Congolese empire. However, a direct military campaign into the area was not an option; Leopold {{would not have been able}} to get permission from either the French or the British according to the rules laid out in the 1884 Berlin Conference, especially considering both nations were looking to annex the <b>Sudan</b> themselves. King Leopold II therefore decided to disguise his campaign into the <b>Sudan</b> as an expeditionary force sent to reclaim the Lado Enclave from the Mahdists, although he inended to give his commanders covert orders to continue their advance far past the boundaries of Belgian territory, first to Fashoda and then on to Khartoum. After receiving a new loan of 6.5 million francs from the Belgian government in 1895, Leopold ordered preparations to be made for the execution of his plan.|$|E
5|$|South <b>Sudan</b> competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. South <b>Sudan</b> {{had been}} an {{independent}} nation since 2011, but its civil war had delayed its membership with the International Olympic Committee until 2015, making 2016 its first official appearance at the Olympic Games. The country was offered three universality placements in athletics, as no South Sudanese athletes met the Olympic qualifying standards prior to the Games. Three athletes, two men and one woman, competed in three track and field events, but did not win any medals. The sole woman, Margret Rumat Hassan, was given a spot eight days {{prior to the start}} of the Games that had been allotted previously to Mangar Makur Chuot. This change was against the advice of the South <b>Sudan</b> Athletics Federation and was due allegedly to pressure from Samsung, for whom Hassan had appeared in an advertisement. The flagbearer for both the opening and closing ceremony was Guor Marial, a marathon runner who, then unable to represent South <b>Sudan,</b> had competed as an Independent Olympic Athlete in 2012. Five South Sudanese nationals also competed as members of the Refugee Olympic Team.|$|E

5|$|The {{region was}} governed under {{a number of}} {{different}} names between 1880 and 1960. The area was Upper River from 1880 until 18 August 1890, when it was renamed French <b>Sudan,</b> with its capital at Kayes. On 10 October 1899, French <b>Sudan</b> was divided, with the southern cercles joining coastal colonies, and the rest split into two administrative areas called Middle Niger and Upper Senegal. In 1902, the region again was organized as a unified colony under the name Senegambia and Niger (Sénégambie et Niger). The name changed again in 1904 to Upper Senegal and Niger (Haut Sénégal et Niger). Finally, in 1921, the name changed back to French <b>Sudan</b> (Soudan Français).|$|E

5|$|By the 1920s Abd al-Rahman was a {{respected}} {{religious and political}} leader. In 1921 he held a meeting at his home where the attendees signed two documents that laid out the Mahdist objectives. These were for <b>Sudan</b> to be ruled by Britain rather than Egypt, and for <b>Sudan</b> to eventually achieve self-government. In the early 1920s, between 5,000 and 15,000 pilgrims were coming to Aba Island each year to celebrate Ramadan. Many of them identified Abd al-Rahman with Isa, the prophet Jesus, and assumed that he would drive the Christian colonists out of <b>Sudan.</b> The British found that Abd al-Rahman was in correspondence with agents and leaders in Nigeria and Cameroon, predicting the eventual victory of the Mahdists over the Christians. They blamed him for unrest in these colonies. After pilgrims from West Africa held mass demonstrations on Aba Island in 1924, Abd al-Rahman was told {{to put a stop}} to the pilgrimages.|$|E
