5|$|Sebum is {{produced}} in a holocrine process, in which cells within the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>gland</b> rupture and disintegrate as they release the sebum and the cell remnants are secreted together with the sebum. The cells are constantly replaced by mitosis {{at the base of}} the duct.|$|E
5|$|The glands deposit sebum on the hairs, {{and bring}} it to the skin surface along the hair shaft. The {{structure}} consisting of hair, hair follicle, arrector pili muscles, and <b>sebaceous</b> <b>gland</b> is an epidermal invagination known as a pilosebaceous unit.|$|E
5|$|The sebaceous glands {{are found}} {{throughout}} {{all areas of}} the skin except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There are two types of <b>sebaceous</b> <b>gland,</b> those connected to hair follicles, in pilosebaceous units, and those that exist independently.|$|E
50|$|In general, sebaceous {{adenitis}} is underdiagnosed in dogs. Diagnosis confirmation requires {{multiple punch}} biopsies analysed by a dermopathologist who will {{comment on the}} condition of the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands,</b> revealing granulomatous or pyogranulomatous inflammation surrounding the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> or even complete destruction of <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> {{are also}} found in hairless areas (glabrous skin) of the eyelids, nose, penis, labia minora, the inner mucosal {{membrane}} of the cheek, and nipples. Some <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> have unique names. <b>Sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> on the lip and mucosa of the cheek, and on the genitalia, are known as Fordyce spots, and glands on the eyelids are known as meibomian <b>glands.</b> <b>Sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> of the breast are also known as Montgomery's glands.|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases of}} {{heterotopic}} <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> in the esophagus, {{found in a}} 71 -year-old male and a 50 -year-old female patient, are reported. In both cases, endoscopic examination revealed multiple yellowish plaques sized 1 to 3 mm in diameter in the esophagus, which were initially interpreted as probable candida infection, xanthoma, or glycogenic acanthosis. Histological examinations of biopsy specimens showed clusters of clear cells in the squamous cell epithelium. They had pale cytoplasm with centrally located small nuclei and closely resembled <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> of the skin, and were histologically interpreted as heterotopic <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> of the esophagus. Along with recent advances in endoscopic technique, reported cases of heterotopic <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> in the esophagus are increasing. However, the histogenesis of heterotopic <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> in the esophagus has not been well established and remains to be established. The present report concerns two cases of heterotopic esophageal <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> accompanied by some immunohistochemical studies...|$|R
5|$|Sebaceous cyst is a {{term used}} to refer to both an epidermoid cyst and a pilar cyst, though neither of these contain sebum, only keratin and do not {{originate}} in the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>gland</b> and so are not true sebaceous cysts. A true sebaceous cyst is relatively rare and is known as a steatocystoma.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are first}} {{visible from the}} 13th to the 16th week of fetal development, as bulgings off hair follicles. Sebaceous glands develop from the same tissue that {{gives rise to the}} {{epidermis}} of the skin. Overexpression of the signalling factors Wnt, Myc and SHH all increase the likelihood of <b>sebaceous</b> <b>gland</b> presence.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous lipids make an {{important}} contribution in maintaining {{the integrity of the}} skin barrier, and express both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Sebum may act as a delivery system for antioxidants, antimicrobial lipids, pheromones, and hydration of the stratum corneum. The insoluble fatty acids contained within sebum have broad antimicrobial activity. Additionally, <b>sebaceous</b> <b>gland</b> secretion provides vitamin E to the upper layers of facial skin.|$|E
40|$|A 43 -year-old Japanese {{woman was}} {{diagnosed}} with ectopic <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> in the esophagus by esophagogastroduodenoscopy and biopsy. At the age of 46, typical ectopic <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> were recognized in the upper esophagus, whereas yellowish white granules were faintly observed in the lower esophagus. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy examinations were repeated when she was 47 and again at 50 years old, and the lesions in the lower esophagus had become more evident over the ensuing 3 years. Esophageal ectopic <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> are relatively infrequent, {{and there have been}} few case reports describing the progression of the endoscopic features. We also report the clinical and endoscopic features of the five similar cases with pathologically proven ectopic <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> in the esophagus...|$|R
40|$|Glucose, glycogen, and ATP {{concentrations}} were {{measured in the}} peripheral and central layers of the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> {{as well as in}} the epidermis. Both carbohydrates exhibited a decreasing gradient of concentration from the periphery to the center of the glands. No differential distribution of ATP content was found in the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands.</b> The periphery of the glands contained 8 m moles glucose, 22 m moles glycogen, and 10 m moles ATP per kg dry weight tissue. The glucose and ATP {{concentrations were}} comparable to those in epidermis, whereas on the basis of lipid-free dry weight the amount of glycogen at the periphery was 6. 3 times that of epidermis. The total NADP concentration in <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> was 0. 5 m moles/kg dry weight, 78 percent of which was in the reduced form; the total NAD concentration was 1. 4 m moles/kg dry weight, 34 percent of which was in the reduced state. <b>Sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> contained 3 times more NADP nucleotides than epidermis. The ratios of the NAD nucleotides to NADP nucleotides were 3 : 1 in the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> and 8 : 1 in the epidermis. Of the 29 enzymes assayed, the most prominent in the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> were α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, alanine amino-transferase, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, and phosphorylase. Enzyme analyses also demonstrated increased contributions of the pentose phosphate pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle, a significant role for glycogen metabolism and active glycolysis. The high activities of α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and triosephosphate isomerase suggest that triosephosphate is being shifted into α-glycerophosphate for the acylglycerol formation. The high aminotransferase activities suggested an important contribution of amino acid metabolism to the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands.</b> The conspicuously high activity of alanine aminotrans-ferase indicates a tissue potential to convert amino acids to pyruvate in <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands.</b> High malic enzyme and malate dehydrogenase activities suggest a malate shunt, by means of which an ATP-driven transhydrogenation between NADP and cytoplasmic NADH occurs to produce NADPH. Isocitrate dehydrogenase was the most active among the NADP-dependent enzymes and appeared to participate in NADPH production in the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands.</b> Acid phosphatase activity was 5 to 7 times greated in the central portion than in the peripheral layers of the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands.</b> Three β-glycosidases were distributed more in the center than in the periphery of the glands. High acid phosphatase activity in the central portion of <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> may reflect its involvement in holocrine secretion...|$|R
50|$|<b>Sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> {{are normal}} {{structures}} of the skin but may also be found ectopically in the mouth, where they {{are referred to as}} oral Fordyce granules or ectopic <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands.</b> On the foreskin they are called Tyson's glands, {{not to be confused with}} hirsuties coronae glandis.|$|R
5|$|Sebum, {{secreted}} by the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>gland</b> in humans, {{is primarily}} composed of triglycerides (~41%), wax esters (~26%), squalene (~12%), and {{free fatty acids}} (~16%). The composition of sebum varies across species. Wax esters and squalene are unique to sebum and not produced as final products {{anywhere else in the}} body. Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is unique to humans, and is implicated in the development of acne. Sebum is odorless, but its breakdown by bacteria can produce strong odors.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hormonal}} {{driver of}} oily sebum {{production in the}} skin is dihydrotestosterone. Another androgenic hormone responsible for increased <b>sebaceous</b> <b>gland</b> activity is DHEA-S. Higher amounts of DHEA-S are secreted during adrenarche (a stage of puberty), and this leads {{to an increase in}} sebum production. In a sebum-rich skin environment, the naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium P. acnes readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around the follicle due to activation of the innate immune system. P. acnes triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing the production of several pro-inflammatory chemical signals (such as IL-1α, IL-8, TNF-α, and LTB4); IL-1α is known to be essential to comedo formation.|$|E
5|$|Acne is a {{very common}} problem, {{particularly}} during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum {{can lead to a}} blockage of the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>gland</b> duct. This can cause a comedo, (commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead), which can lead to infection, particularly by the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes. This can inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be 'black' or 'white' depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments—innocuous build-ups of sebum—are often mistaken for whiteheads.|$|E

40|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of acne vulgaris {{depends on}} active <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands,</b> implying that selective destruction of <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> {{could be an}} effective treatment. We hypothesized that light-absorbing microparticles could be delivered into <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands,</b> enabling local injury by optical pulses. A suspension of topically applied gold-coated silica microparticles exhibiting plasmon resonance with strong absorption at 800 nm was delivered into human pre-auricular and swine <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> in vivo, using mechanical vibration. After exposure to 10 – 50 J cm − 2, 30 milliseconds, 800 nm diode laser pulses, microscopy revealed preferential thermal injury to <b>sebaceous</b> follicles and <b>glands,</b> consistent with predictions from a computational model. Inflammation was mild; gold particles were not retained in swine skin 1 month after treatment, and uptake in other organs was negligible. Two independent prospective randomized controlled clinical trials were performed for treatment of moderate-to-severe facial acne, using unblinded and blinded assessments of disease severity. Each trial showed clinically and statistically significant improvement of inflammatory acne following three treatments given 1 – 2 weeks apart. In Trial 2, inflammatory lesions were significantly reduced at 12 weeks (P = 0. 015) and 16 weeks (P = 0. 04) compared with sham treatments. Optical microparticles enable selective photothermolysis of <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands.</b> This {{appears to be a}} well-tolerated, effective treatment for acne vulgaris...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in <b>sebaceous</b> <b>gland</b> activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
25|$|Both Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis are {{typically}} {{found on the}} human face. Demodex folliculorum resides in hair follicles, whereas Demodex brevis survives in sebaceous glands adjacent to hair follicles. For instance, around the eye area, Demodex folliculorum {{is found in the}} follicles of the eyelashes. In contrast, Demodex brevis inhabits the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>gland</b> of the eyelashes and the meibomian glands. Demodex brevis was first separated from Demodex folliculorum in 1963 by Akbulatova.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin's exact {{mechanism}} of action is unknown, but several {{studies have shown that}} isotretinoin induces apoptosis (programmatic cell death) in various cells in the body. Cell death may be instigated in the meibomian glands, hypothalamic cells, hippocampus cells and—important for treatment of acne—in <b>sebaceous</b> <b>gland</b> cells. Isotretinoin has a low affinity for retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR), but may be converted intracellularly to metabolites that act as agonists of RAR and RXR nuclear receptors.|$|E

The present immunohistochemical study examined the expression and localization of CD 36, MCT 1, FATP 4, and E-FABP in the <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands,</b> including the meibomian and preputial glands of mice. CD 36 and MCT 1 in <b>sebaceous</b> <b>glands</b> were largely co-localized along the plasma membrane of secretory cells, while they were separately expressed in the glandular portion of meibomian and preputial glands. Immunoreactivities for FATP 4 and E-FABP appeared diffusely in the cytoplasm of secretory cells. Genetic deletion of CD 36 did not affect the immunolocalization of the three other molecules.

500|$|A major {{mechanism}} of acne-related skin inflammation is mediated by P. acnes ability to bind and activate {{a class of}} immune system receptors known as toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR2 and TLR4. Activation of TLR2 and TLR4 by P. acnes leads to increased secretion of [...] IL-1α, IL-8, and TNF-α. Release of these inflammatory signals attracts various immune cells to the hair follicle including neutrophils, macrophages, and Th1 cells. IL-1α stimulates increased skin cell activity and reproduction, which in turn fuels comedo development. Furthermore, <b>sebaceous</b> <b>gland</b> cells produce more antimicrobial peptides, such as HBD1 and HBD2, in response to binding of TLR2 and TLR4.|$|E

[...] Both sexes will often urinate while scent-marking. [...] Males and females scent-mark in different ways: females rub their genital glands in an up-and-down motion against trees, while males may use their chest gland, genital glands, {{or a combination of}} both. Males also use their specialized toothcomb to gouge trees before scent-marking with their chest—a behavior that leaves long-lasting visible marks.
