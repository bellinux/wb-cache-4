500|$|Jeremy Thompson from Roller Coaster Philosophy {{said that}} [...] "the ride itself is okay, but I’m not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> really loved the whole experience.", but that [...] "still, it’s got a more {{interesting}} layout." [...] A group of roller coaster enthusiasts also {{came to the conclusion}} that the ride wasn't the best but still good, [...] "The general consensus is that it's a good, but not quite great, ride that's perfect for family-oriented Dorney." ...|$|E
500|$|Cliff Richard as Cliff Richard Jr. Contracted in Portugal, {{where he}} owned a house [...] "next-door-but-one" [...] to Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, after {{negotiations}} with his agent, Peter Gormley, singer Richard says of his casting that he was [...] "thrilled" [...] {{to be part of}} the well-known and popular Thunderbirds franchise. Richard has fond memories of the making of his Supermarionation lookalike puppet: [...] "It was quite a hoot... I was never really <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> looked like my puppet or it looked like me." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{feel like}} I'm {{definitely}} a genuine batsman," [...] Maxwell said. [...] "I've {{done a lot}} of work on my technique over the last few years... I've played some good Shield innings where I've played technically really good cricket... I'm <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> get the chance to play Test cricket I'll probably be a bit more reserved." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "kena" [...] - to get caught/punished; {{often used}} like a noun ("I <b>sure</b> kena <b>if</b> <b>I</b> cheat"). From the Malay passive verb [...] "kena".|$|R

2500|$|Pitt, {{who plays}} a {{particularly}} unintelligent character, said of his role, [...] "After reading the part, which they said was hand-written for myself, I was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> should be flattered or insulted." [...] Pitt also said when he was shown the script, he told the Coens {{he did not know}} how to play the part because the character was such an idiot: [...] "There was a pause, and then Joel goes...'You'll be fine'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Riggins, who ran nine {{straight}} {{times to}} help Washington {{run out the}} clock in the final quarter, finished the game with 140 rushing yards and two touchdowns, setting an NFL record with three consecutive 100-yard posteason games. [...] "I’ve {{waited a long time}} for this,” he said after the game. “I’m really thrilled. To tell you the truth, after the strike, I wasn’t <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to continue the season. I was ready to pack my bags and head for Kansas. Boy, what a mistake that would have been.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} contest between {{universities}} from different countries, Oxford v Yale at the Queen's Club, West Kensington, in 1894, Fry came {{third in the}} long jump and won the 100yards. In addition to being an outstanding long jumper, sprinter and high jumper, Fry was also a talented hurdler, once competing against Godfrey Shaw the champion hurdler of the time, who beat him but told him, as Fry later recalled: [...] "He was <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> took up hurdling seriously I might win the championship." [...] Fry was also president of the Oxford University athletics club in 1894.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{stick to}} the road they'll catch me <b>sure,</b> and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> leave it I'll have to go right into the woods, and they'll easily see my trail," [...] he reasoned.|$|R
6000|$|The {{letter was}} almost as much his as her own, and he ended his {{dictation}} thus: 'Say that <b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> get better we may make arrangements for their marriage.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Beck's {{previous}} album, Modern Guilt, {{was released}} in 2008, and was the final album released under his Interscope Records contract. In the interim between album releases, Beck worked {{on a wide variety}} of projects, including new studio material, most of which went unreleased for several years. In October 2012, bassist and frequent collaborator Justin Meldal-Johnsen commented: [...] "I would estimate that there are currently about three or four albums’ worth of material floating around," [...] and Beck himself said that [...] "I wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was going to put out a record – or if I should put out a record. It felt like I was standing still, while everything else was in such flux." ...|$|E
2500|$|The task of {{formally}} investigating {{student and}} alumni complaints fell to L. Hollingsworth Wood, Vice-Chair of Fisk's board of trustees, and chief {{spokesman for the}} trustees. Du Bois criticized Wood in articles in The Crisis, accusing him of ignoring evidence of McKenzie's [...] "incompetency" [...] and suggesting that Wood advised the Greater Fisk Committee [...] "to keep silent." [...] Wood reported, [...] "Our colored friends do not quite realize what they demand of a person in McKenzie's position and {{of his wife and}} children." [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> took the presidency of Fisk and played golf or hunted or danced or dined with the cultured whites of Nashville that but few of my many Negro friends would keep unshaken faith in me, and many would attribute sinister motives to perfectly innocent actions on my part." [...] Wood sympathized with some of the students' demands, noting their irritation over [...] "some rather antiquated regulations as to dress and discipline," [...] and conceding that [...] "President's McKenzie's Scotch nature is a bit unbending." [...] Wood responded to accusations that Fisk was at the mercy of Southern interests, declaring, [...] "that there has been anything even distantly resembling ‘Selling out to the South' is utterly preposterous. Wood praised McKenzie in gaining the good will of the citizens of Nashville, Vanderbilt and Peabody Colleges, but this ‘keeping-the-Negro-in-his-place" [...] cry is utterly unfounded." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Tom Perrotta of The Wall Street Journal called Radwańska [...] "the most tactically sound, subtle {{tennis player}} in the world." [...] Over the years she has been given the nicknames [...] "The Magician", [...] "Ninja" [...] and [...] "The Professor", {{due to the fact}} that she can pull off the most {{difficult}} shots in the game with ease. Radwańska's game is founded on variety, mobility, and a tendency to anticipate her opponent's actions. She often uses this style to construct rallies—either opening the court up for a winner, or prompting a surprised opponent to hit a misplaced return. Her primary weapons include a mixture of slices and lobs, along with her ability to hit the ball at a variety of angles. She also makes use of a disguised drop shot, often swung with the same motion as a normal stroke during a rally. She is also noted for her crouching shots, during which she quickly drops in place to return or redirect a low ball, along with her use of an overhead backhand while on defense. In fact, she is known for having invented her distinctive squat position shot, where she sits so low on her haunches that she can play half-volleys with a horizontal racket. “I’m not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> invented it,” says Radwanska, “but I was definitely one of the first ones. When I watch TV, I can hear commentators say that was my shot, even if someone else is playing, so it’s nice to hear I can put something new into tennis”.|$|E
5000|$|... "In {{some ways}} it was {{probably}} the most stupid thing I ever did because I'm <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have been banned from television, that's why. I used to be on Blue Peter and all those things, regularly, and it all, pffffft, stopped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish we had!" [...] again {{interrupted}} Peterkin with a sigh.--"I'm <b>sure,</b> Ralph, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had thought}} that you were coming back again I would willingly have awaited your return for months rather than have endured the mental agony which I went through.--But proceed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘How very absurd you are, my love! I {{must give}} {{directions}} to the servants; I am quite <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> sat here and allowed John to spill the gravy over the new carpet, you’d {{be the first to}} find fault when you saw the stain to-morrow morning.’ ...|$|R
