50|$|Interestingly the <b>swell</b> of the <b>organ</b> {{is built}} into the back wall of the Church. The {{shutters}} of the swell are in line {{with the rest of the}} wall. The organ console itself was moved in a general redevelopment of the church in 1995. This was to facilitate the direction of the choir.|$|R

50|$|In 1901, when Sir Edward Bairstow was organist, the {{instrument}} was rebuilt by Norman & Beard of Norwich. Parts of the former organ were retained, but most was new. Further work was done in 1906 and 1948. It remained in use until the latest re-building in 1963. The work was done by William Hill and Son and Norman and Beard, also known as Hill, Norman & Beard who had a connection of more than 100 years with the parish church. Most of the 1901 instrument was retained after restoration and re-voicing. The pneumatic action was replaced with electro-pneumatic action, and a new detached console {{was placed in the}} Crawford Chapel with access to the chancel by means of a door through the screen. Apart from re-voicing and one new rank on each division, the great and <b>swell</b> <b>organs</b> remained much as they were. Only the pedal organ was significantly enlarged by adding ranks of 4 ft and 2 ft pitch, a three rank mixture and 4 ft solo reed, and the trombone was extended to 8 ft and 4 ft pitch. Before 1901 there was a 4 ft stop and a three rank mixture on the pedal organ, both of which were discarded in 1901.The old choir organ was replaced by an unenclosed positif organ of authentic antique scale and with the part of {{the instrument}} that was new in 1963 was placed in the eastern bay of the Leigh Chapel, with the pedal gemshorn on display. The specification was drawn up by Mr A. G. D. Cutter, the organist in consultation with Mr R Mark Fairhead, of Hill, Norman & Beard Ltd., who was responsible for the tonal finishing of the organ.|$|R
50|$|On most organs, {{at least}} one {{division}} will be enclosed. On a two-manual (Great and <b>Swell)</b> <b>organ,</b> {{this will be the}} Swell division (from whence the name comes); on larger organs often part, or all of, the Choir and Solo divisions will be enclosed as well.|$|E

50|$|Very {{little work}} was done until 1971, when vicar John Hunt {{directed}} {{the removal of the}} organ and the installation of a new <b>swell</b> <b>organ,</b> with a console near the font (placed in the south transept in 1997). The roof of the chancel and the nave was releaded and the church also gained a modern heating system.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a cry of}} [...] "Delia" [...] and no more. But {{suddenly}} the flames spurted out in a blinding glare that shot upward to an immense height, a blinding brilliance broken by a thousand flickering gleams like the waving of swords. And a gust of sparks, flashing in a thousand colours, whirled up and vanished. Just then, {{and for a moment}} by some strange accident, a rush of music, like the <b>swell</b> of an <b>organ,</b> wove into the roaring of the flames.|$|R
5|$|The {{connectors}} at {{the back}} of the Stage allow the connection of a sustain pedal, a <b>swell</b> pedal for <b>organ,</b> a footswitch to select the rotary speaker emulation speed, and a control pedal to modify effects such as wah-wah. A set of screw-in legs are an available option for the 88 and 76 note models and a custom designed soft case is also available from Clavia. A third party company, Ocean Beach Digital, has manufactured a set of MIDI controlled drawbars for the Nord Stage, for users who prefer to use real drawbars instead of the buttons provided as standard.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in {{the nineteenth}} century, it became common for one or more {{divisions}} of pipes in a pipe organ to be enclosed in a wooden box, at least one side of which would consist of palettes that open and close {{in a manner similar}} to a Venetian blind. A mechanical (later electrical) mechanism connected the box to a pedal that the organist would use to open and close the shutters, adjusting the perceived loudness of the sound. When the box is shut (or closed), less sound is released into the venue. In American and British organs, the enclosed division is usually named the Swell, and the box surrounding the pipes is usually referred to as the swell box. Thus, the expression pedal is sometimes known as the swell pedal or <b>swell</b> shoe. Larger <b>organs</b> may have two or more expression pedals, allowing the volume of different divisions to be individually controlled.|$|R
50|$|A more {{substantial}} rebuild {{took place in}} 1881/82, including enlarging the <b>Swell</b> <b>organ,</b> converting all manuals to the German compass of C-f3, and providing a new pedalboard with Bourdon pipes C-e1; by 1882 also, {{the feet of the}} pipes in the organ case towershad been replaced with new ones of zinc. A new console was provided, which survives to this day, displaying Gray and Davison's ivory name-plate.|$|E
5000|$|Brindley was a {{follower}} of Edmund Schulze. He built solid instruments with powerful choruses using Vogler’s Simplification system. Pipes placed in chromatic order on the soundboards allowed for a simple and reliable key action and permitted similar stops to share the same bass, keeping both space and cost to a minimum. The <b>Swell</b> <b>organ</b> was often mounted above the Great in the German manner.|$|E
50|$|The 18-ton organ {{underwent}} $15,000 in {{repairs to}} its bellows in 2008, with the sheep skin seams {{being replaced by}} rubberized bellows cloth. The repairs were undertaken by Maritime Pipe Organ Builders Ltd. of Moncton, New Brunswick. The tubular chimes in the <b>Swell</b> <b>Organ,</b> now disconnected, were donated in about 1929 by the Lady’s Aid group of the Church. They were activated by an electro-pneumatic action and were dis-connected from the wind supply during repairs to the bellows.|$|E

5000|$|Further {{innovations}} {{were made}} in later years; the buff stop was introduced c.1760, and was sometimes activated by a pedal on single manual instruments. The machine stop, dating from after 1765, was a mechanism worked by a hand stop and a foot pedal which caused various changes in registration, rather like the arrangements on an organ. The 'nag's head swell' was {{a segment of the}} top lid shaped like an elongated horse's head, which opened along the bentside when a foot pedal was pressed; this was later superseded by Schudi's Venetian swell, which worked similarly but was more like a modern <b>organ</b> <b>swell</b> mechanism (and named after its similarity in appearance to a Venetian blind). Extensions in range were also made, as high as [...] upwards; this was perhaps due to musical demands or rivalry with Shudi, who had extended his harpsichords down to CC. Jacob Kirkman made an experimental enharmonic harpsichord for Robert Smith of Trinity College, Cambridge, around 1757.|$|R
50|$|A new second {{pipe organ}} was {{installed}} at St Hildeburgh's {{with the cost}} being raised by public subscription in the 1920s. This organ, built and installed by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool, specified by the organist, Norman Biller, comprised Swell, Great, Choir and Pedal organs with both the Choir and Swell organs being enclosed, instead of just the more usual <b>swell</b> <b>organ</b> only. The motor to power the bellows was replaced in 1970 {{at a cost of}} £10,000 and the organ was rebuilt in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|In 1822 a new organ was {{installed}} by Thomas Elliot The organ was extended in 1855 by William Hill who provided pedal pipes of 2 octaves and 2 notes. He also revoiced the reeds and open diapason in the swell, and extended the <b>swell</b> <b>organ</b> to tenor c, enclosing it {{in a new}} Venetian swell-box. This organ was rebuilt by John Banfield & Son in 1875 and renovated and enlarged to 3 manuals and 40 stops by Banfield in 1883. In 1906 this was sold to St John's Church, Deritend.|$|E
50|$|Eleanor Spraggon died in December 1826. On 13 May 1828 {{he married}} {{his second wife}} Ann Thompson in St Andrew's Church, Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1836 he moved to Ryton-on-Tyne.

5000|$|Will Hermes of Rolling Stone {{said that}} [...] "the melodies, guitarscapes and {{thrift-shop}} <b>organ</b> <b>swells</b> make for exquisite comfort". Zack Kotzer and David Greenwald of The A.V. Club gave the album an A−, saying [...] "Bloom takes what worked before and intensifies it" [...] and {{that with the}} record, [...] "they have mastered their sultry formula". Other reviews of Bloom were more mixed. Annie Zaleski of Alternative Press felt that the album did not possess [...] "as many memorable hooks (or as many well-defined song structures)" [...] as the bands previous album, Teen Dream, and that as a result, [...] "the record tends to fade into the background and become something so indistinct that its forgettable, even after multiple listens." [...] Maddy Costa of The Guardian criticized the albums lack of surprises, writing that [...] "nothing happens to shatter the perfect surface, either within individual songs or across the album as a whole, and that might be Blooms problem. Its beautiful, spectral, dreamy, but never makes your pulse quicken." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had in fact}} for {{the time}} no direction; in spite of which indeed {{he was at the}} end of ten minutes aware of having walked {{straight}} to the south. That, he afterwards recognised, was, very sufficiently, because there had formed itself in his mind, even while Aunt Maud finally talked, an instant recognition of his necessary course. Nothing was open to him but to follow Kate, nor was anything more marked than the influence of the step she had taken on the emotion itself that possessed him. Her complications, which had fairly, with everything else, an awful sound--what were they, a thousand times over, but his own? His present business was to see that they didn't escape an hour longer taking their proper place in his life. He accordingly would have held his course hadn't it suddenly come over him that he had just lied to Mrs. Lowder--a term it perversely eased him to keep using--even more than was necessary. To what church was he going, to what church, in such a state of his nerves, could he go?--he pulled up short again, as he had pulled up in sight of Mrs. Lowder's carriage, to ask it. And yet the desire queerly stirred in him not to have wasted his word. He was just then however by a happy chance in the Brompton Road, and he bethought himself with a sudden light that the Oratory was at hand. He had but to turn the other way and he should find himself soon before it. At the door then, in a few minutes, his idea was really--as it struck him--consecrated: he was, pushing in, on the edge of a splendid service--the flocking crowd told of it--which glittered and resounded, from distant depths, in the blaze of altar-lights and the <b>swell</b> of <b>organ</b> and choir. It didn't match his own day, but it was much less of a discord than some other things actual and possible. The Oratory in short, to make him right, would do.|$|R
6000|$|But {{another and}} even greater {{surprise}} greeted {{him as he}} toiled up the rocky slope towards his farmhouse. The windows of the sitting-room, which were usually blank and black by night, were glittering with unfamiliar light. Like most farmers, he seldom used the room except for formal company, his wife usually avoiding it, and even he himself now preferred the dining-room or the kitchen. His first suggestion {{that his wife had}} visitors gave him a sense of pleasure on her account, mingled, however, with a slight uneasiness of his own which he could not account for. More than that, as he approached nearer he could hear the <b>swell</b> of the <b>organ</b> above the roar of the swaying pines, and the cadences were not of a devotional character. He hesitated for a moment, as he had hesitated at the fire in the woods; yet it was surely his own house! He hurried to the door, opened it; not only the light of the sitting-room streamed into the hall, but the ruddier glow of an actual fire in the disused grate! The familiar dark furniture had been rearranged to catch some of the glow and relieve its sombreness. And his wife, rising from the music-stool, was the room's only occupant! ...|$|R
5000|$|Roger also blended and voiced the reeds, {{particularly}} the swell reeds. It {{is believed that}} his idea was to match the swell of the superb Fr Willis organ of Truro Cathedral. Whether or not this was the case, the <b>swell</b> <b>organ</b> is an absolute delight to hear. The blending of this instrument is clearly {{the work of a}} master craftsman and we are surely indebted to Roger Yates for the work that he carried out. Although the organ is mostly that which Hele and Sons built, it is unique and very special, some may say its almost an [...] "honorary Willis".|$|E
50|$|The {{greatest}} jewel adorning {{the church}} altars, the pipe organ, one {{can hear the}} magical sounds of nature every Sunday in the worship service. The pipe organ was built by Misquith & Co. Organ Builders, a company from Madras. Erected by public subscription in May 1903, the pipe organ has retained its original melody and music. Consisting of <b>swell</b> <b>organ,</b> great organ and the pedals, it has a total of 392 pipes, 112 of which are wooden and the remainder are lead. The bellows were originally pumped by hand on the strike of a bell from the organist, and now use a 3HP three-phase electric motor. Mohan Satya Raj has played the pipe organ for about the last 25 years.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the overall}} {{intrinsic}} {{quality of the}} instrument, Skinner crafted the final piece to include a four manual, one hundred and seven stop, sixty-three rank and four-thousand five hundred and forty-two pipes organ. All together, the organ comprises one Great Organ, a <b>Swell</b> <b>Organ,</b> a Choir Organ featuring a 16-foot Contra Dulciana, Choir Organ Echo, a Solo Organ, Solo Organ Echo, an Arch Organ outfitted with an 8-foot Arch Clarion, a 64-foot Gravissima and a 32-foot Bourdon Profunda, {{in addition to the}} final traps that were enclosed in the choir: Bass drum, castanets, Chinese block, crash cymbal, gong snare drum (f), snare drum (ff), and a tambourine triangle. Like other Skinner-built organs, the instrument was designed to replicate the whole symphony.|$|E
60|$|Content, {{and weary}} of our elevation, we descended the {{corkscrew}} stairs {{and left the}} church; the last object that we noticed in the interior being a bird, which appeared {{to be at home}} there, and responded with its cheerful notes to the <b>swell</b> of the <b>organ.</b> Pausing on the church-steps, we observed that there were formerly two statues, one {{on each side of the}} doorway; the canopies still remaining and the pedestals being about a yard from the ground. Some of Mr. Cotton's Puritan parishioners are probably responsible for the disappearance of these stone saints. This doorway at the base of the tower is now much dilapidated, but must once have been very rich and of a peculiar fashion. It opens its arch through a great square tablet of stone, reared against the front of the tower. On most of the projections, whether on the tower or about the body of the church, there are gargoyles of genuine Gothic grotesqueness,--fiends, beasts, angels, and combinations of all three; and where portions of the edifice are restored, the modern sculptors have tried to imitate these wild fantasies, but with very poor success. Extravagance and absurdity have still their law, and should pay as rigid obedience to it as the primmest things on earth.|$|R
5000|$|Like the {{arrangement}} of stops, the keyboard divisions are also arranged in a common order. Taking the English names as an example, the main manual (the bottom manual on two-manual instruments or the middle manual on three-manual instruments) is traditionally called the Great, and the upper manual is called the Swell. If {{there is a third}} manual, it is usually the Choir and is placed below the Great. (The name [...] "Choir" [...] is a corruption of [...] "Chair", as this division initially came from the practice of placing a smaller, self-contained, organ {{at the rear of the}} organist's bench. This is also why it is called a Positif which means portable organ.) If it is included, the Solo manual is usually placed above the <b>Swell.</b> Some larger <b>organs</b> contain an Echo or Antiphonal division, usually controlled by a manual placed above the Solo. German and American organs generally use the same configuration of manuals as English organs. On French instruments, the main manual (the Grand Orgue) is at the bottom, with the Positif and the Récit above it. If there are more manuals, the Bombarde is usually above the Récit and the Grand Choeur is below the Grand Orgue or above the Bombarde.|$|R
60|$|During {{my recent}} {{residence}} in the country, I used frequently to attend at the old village church. Its shadowy aisles, its mouldering monuments, its dark oaken panelling, all reverend with the gloom of departed years, seemed to fit it for the haunt of solemn meditation; but, being in a wealthy, aristocratic neighborhood, the glitter of fashion penetrated even into the sanctuary; and I felt myself continually thrown back upon the world, by the frigidity and pomp of the poor worms around me. The only being in the whole congregation who appeared thoroughly to feel the humble and prostrate piety of a true Christian was a poor decrepit old woman, bending {{under the weight of}} years and infirmities. She bore the traces of something better than abject poverty. The lingerings of decent pride were visible in her appearance. Her dress, though humble in the extreme, was scrupulously clean. Some trivial respect, too, had been awarded her, for she did not take her seat among the village poor, but sat alone {{on the steps of the}} altar. She seemed to have survived all love, all friendship, all society, and to have nothing left her but the hopes of heaven. When I saw her feebly rising and bending her aged form in prayer; habitually conning her prayer-book, which her palsied hand and failing eyes could not permit her to read, but which she evidently knew by heart, I felt persuaded that the faltering voice of that poor woman arose to heaven far before the responses of the clerk, the <b>swell</b> of the <b>organ,</b> or the chanting of the choir.|$|R
5000|$|The Voix celeste {{is located}} in the <b>swell</b> <b>organ</b> on British and American organs and in the Récit expressif on French organs. It is {{designed}} to be used in conjunction with a stop of similar tonal quality of its own, normally a Viola da gamba (Viole de gambe) Fr. or Salicional. When both stops are played together an undulant, warm sounding string effect is generated. When proper organ terminology is used, [...] "Voix Celeste" [...] will always use string-voiced pipes. Frequently, both ranks of pipes required are placed on the same stop knob, and it is labeled as [...] "Voix Celeste II". The celeste concept is extended to other types of organ voices (notably flutes) but they will be called by the name of the primary sound (e.g. [...] "Spitzflöte Celeste").|$|E
50|$|Around 1830 a secondhand organ, {{built by}} John Byfield in 1760 for the Lord Mayor's Chapel in Bristol, {{was sold to}} Mr. H. Smith {{and moved to the}} church. It stood in the gallery of the church, but was moved down when the church was being restored. It had two and a half manuals, the half being the <b>swell</b> <b>organ.</b> The {{restoration}} committee decided not to sell the old instrument but to have it enlarged, and in 1883, they contracted with Conacher and Co who enlarged it to three manuals and 27 speaking stops. It was re-opened on 21 February 1884, the festivities including a recital by the newly appointed organist, Throne Biggs, late deputy organist of Lichfield Cathedral. A specification of the organ {{can be found on the}} National Pipe Organ Register. It was moved from its original position in the north aisle to the north chancel around 1910.|$|E
50|$|In 1924, John D. Spreckels {{commissioned}} the Ernest M. Skinner Company of Boston {{to build the}} symphonic organ. The museum organ, which is housed inside the museum above the main galleries, has 4 manuals and pedals, 7 divisions, 63 ranks, {{with a total of}} 4,526 pipes. Symphonic music is especially effective on the museum organ with its battery of pneumatically operated percussion instruments and set of tubular chimes. A thunder pedal is used for the musical representation of storms. All together, the organ comprises one Great Organ, a <b>Swell</b> <b>Organ,</b> a Choir Organ featuring a 16-foot Contra Dulciana, Choir Organ Echo, a Solo Organ, Solo Organ Echo, an Arch Organ outfitted with 8-foot Arch Clarion, a 64-foot Gravissima and a 32-foot Bourdon Profunda, in addition to the final Traps that were enclosed in the Choir: Bass drum, castanets, Chinese block, crash cymbal, gong snare drum (f), snare drum (ff), and a tambourine triangle.|$|E
60|$|He durst {{not move}} or speak. His was a silent passive nature, except when under strong stimulus, and Cherry {{respected}} his silence {{a great deal}} too much to break upon it by any information. She was half sorry when the noise of steps showed that the congregation were beginning to drop in, chiefly of the other young Confirmation candidates. Then presently Alda came, and whispered to her that Wilmet could not leave Mamma; and presently after, Lady Price bustled in with her daughter, looked severely at Alda {{under the impression that}} she was Wilmet very improperly tricked out, and pressed Fernando's hand before going on to her own place. Then came the low <b>swell</b> of the <b>organ,</b> another new sensation to one who had only heard opera music; then the approaching sound of the voices. Geraldine gave him the book open at the processional psalm, and the white-clad choir passed by, one of the first pair of choristers being Lance, singing with all his might, and that merry monkey-face full of a child's beautiful happy reverence. And again could be recognised Felix, Mr. Audley, Mr. Bevan, all whom the poor sick stranger had come to love best, all to his present perception glorified and beautiful. They had told him it would be all faith and no sight, but he seemed to find himself absolutely within that brighter better sphere to which they belonged, to see them walking in it in their white robes, to hear their songs of praise, and to know whence came that atmosphere that they carried about with them, and that he had felt when it was a riddle to him.|$|R
50|$|The present organ's oak case is {{the same}} one made to enclose the organ that was built for St Clement's in 1696, {{probably}} by Renatus Harris who maintained the instrument until 1704. While the case has remained largely intact, the organ itself has been variously rebuilt and restored; in 1704 by Christian Smith, and in 1711 by Abraham Jordan (c.1666-1716)—who it is thought added the <b>swell</b> <b>organ</b> to the two manual instrument. From 1838 the organ was in the care of Messrs Gray and Davison, who in 1872—as part of the renovation of the building—moved the organ from the west gallery to the south aisle. Care of the organ was transferred to Henry Wedlake that same year. In 1889 he rebuilt the instrument. Further work was undertaken in 1926 by Messrs J. W. Walker, and in 1936 by Messrs Hill, Norman and Beard, whew the instrument was moved back to an approximation of its original west-end location. The same company overhauled the organ in 1946, and in 1971 made 'neo-baroque' tonal revisions, which remain to this day. The instrument was last cleaned and repaired in 2004 by Colin Jilks of Sittingbourne, Kent.|$|E
50|$|The organ's history {{contains}} many mysteries. One concerns the famous and historic organ builder John Byfield {{who worked on}} the organ during 1740 according to reports in the Ipswich Journal. When Hunter rebuilt the organ in 1898 he used most of Thamar's pipework on the great organ except for the cornet and trumpet which he replaced with a harmonic flute and gamba. The cornet went missing and the trumpet was lost. The swell incorporated at least three eighteenth century stops. The restoration by Bishop and Son of Ipswich in 1970 was sensitive and imaginative. The Thamar organ was restored with no additions or subtractions (apart from a board for bottom C#). The cornet was rediscovered in the Rectory attic and repaired, restored and reconstructed. A very old rank of trumpet pipes was found to replace the lost set. The swell was matched up to complement the great and based on its 18th century content. The pedal was likewise treated. The Cromorne was introduced by John Budgen of Bishops and is an excellent and versatile addition to the <b>swell</b> <b>organ.</b> A pedal reed was also added. The organ specification is available at the National Pipe Organ Register. The organ has illustrious associations: Mendelssohn is believed to have given lessons to Caroline Attwood when he visited her elder brother George Attwood, then Rector. Mendelssohn knew George's father, Thomas Attwood, composer and organist of St. Paul's Cathedral and one time pupil of Mozart.|$|E
