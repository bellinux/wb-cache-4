500|$|Monitor {{was soon}} in trouble {{as the storm}} {{increased}} in ferocity. Large waves were splashing over and completely covering the deck and pilot house so the crew temporarily rigged the wheel atop the turret which was manned by helmsman Francis Butts.

Right when the Worthington pump could no longer keep pace with the flooding a call came from the engine room that water was gaining there. Realizing the ship was in serious trouble, Bankhead signaled Rhode Island for help and hoisted the red lantern next to Monitors white running light atop the turret. He then ordered the anchor dropped to stop the ship's rolling and pitching with little effect making it no easier for the rescue boats to get close enough to receive her crew.

The term steam generator (as opposed to boiler) usually refers to an automated unit with a long spiral tube that water is pumped through and is surrounded by flame and hot gases, with steam issuing at the output end. There is no pressure vessel in the ordinary sense of a boiler. Because there is no capacity for storage, the <b>steam</b> generator's <b>output</b> must change to meet demand.

50|$|DVRPP is a two-on-one {{combined}} cycle power plant, combining {{the output of}} two 50MW combustion turbines with one 22MW steam turbine.

5000|$|Leon Serpollet and {{his brother}} Henri, early French steam car pioneers, worked {{together}} to perfect the flash tube boiler that introduced an efficient and new way produce steam. The exact date that their innovative system was first built appears to be unknown, but after further development it went on to make steam power in an automobile more practical because of its advanced design and quick <b>steam</b> <b>output.</b> The brothers formed Société des Moteurs Serpollet Frères. They made a steam tricycle in the late eighteen-eighties to test the steam engines and it soon convinced others of the merit of the design.|$|E
50|$|Generating tubes {{filled with}} water are {{in direct contact with}} the heat source inside the boiler, causing damage to the pipes as well as scaling. These boilers however are great with steam {{production}} due to the large volume inside the boiler and the surface area of the <b>steam</b> <b>output.</b> In order for these boilers to operate properly, they require a long warm-up process, and are prone to thermal shock of the boiler. These boilers can be rated up to 500,000 lb/hr. The wall membrane of the boiler are dual welded, (welded {{on either side of the}} wall membrane) to provide extra reinforcement for high loads.|$|E
50|$|The Clayton steam {{generator}} {{is similar to}} the Stone-Vapor, but the burner and flow directions are reversed. The heating coil is mounted within a simple cylindrical casing. Rather than helical, cylindrical layers, the Clayton coils are arranged as layers of flat spirals. Water is pumped into the top layers and forced downwards. Again, the tube diameter increases in steps, as evaporation takes place. The final turns form a single closely spaced helical cylinder around the burner as a water-wall furnace and is heated by radiant heat. The <b>steam</b> <b>output</b> is passed through a centrifugal separator and a dry steam quality of 99.5% is claimed.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of steam {{generator}} irons, pressurised and non-pressurised. A non-pressurised steam generator iron will produce a lot of steam but the steam is released at a lower speed, typically around 80-100 grams per minute. A pressurised steam generator iron, on the other hand, creates a highly pressurised environment that helps the steam penetrate fabric more efficiently. A pressurised steam generator iron will typically have a <b>steam</b> <b>output</b> of 100-120 grams per minute. The amount of pressure a steam generator iron has is measured in bars, with a higher bar number meaning the steam has more pressure. Steam generator irons typically have 3-6 bars of pressure.|$|E
50|$|Cornertube boilers were {{developed}} for small <b>steam</b> <b>output.</b> The design was based around two factors that, along with excellent water circulation, should be appropriate cooling even at light loads. Its special feature is its Monocoque body i.e. the unheated downcomers form the supporting frame work {{and not the}} thermally loaded tubes, hence the name corner tube boiler.Moreover, the piping-arrangement (system) is also responsible; to manage the riser tubes and water distribution in riser tubes and down comers and to collect the steam water mixture {{and to make a}} certain amount of pre-separation of steam and water mixture. Put simply, the water circulation takes place simultaneously through the drum and through the unheated down comers outside the drum.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{electrode}} boiler pumps water from {{the lower part of the}} vessel to an internal header that has nozzles that allow the water to flow to electrodes. Generally the working pressure is maintained at 10 bar. If more pressure is needed (more steam) the controls speed up the pump and flow more water through additional nozzles. As the needed pressure is reached the pump controls the flow of water to obtain the desired <b>steam</b> <b>output</b> (in kg per hour) at the desired pressure. On larger systems the pump can be controlled by a variable frequency drive (VFD) so energy is not wasted. This control system can also control de-aerator pumps and controls.|$|E
