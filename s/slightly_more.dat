5|$|Amalthea radiates <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> heat than it {{receives}} from the Sun, {{which is probably}} due to the influence of Jovian heat flux (<9 kelvin), sunlight reflected from the planet (<5K), and charged particle bombardment (<2 K).

Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3-9 minutes between 07:07 and 01:07 eastbound, and every 2-6 minutes between 05:19 and 00:06 westbound. When operational problems {{occur on the}} line, Arnos Grove station may act as a temporary terminus of a reduced service – either a shuttle service between Arnos Grove and Cockfosters or a truncated service from Central London. The station has a set of seven sidings to its south for stabling trains.|$|E
5|$|Across Micronesia, {{impact from}} the typhoon was fairly limited. Winds on Nukuoro were {{estimated}} at 45–75km/h (30–45mph), resulting in minor {{damage to buildings}} and crops. Losses on the atoll reached $10,000. Lukunor, located farther west, experienced similar winds; however, damage was <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> severe. Notable coastal impact took place, with portions of the dock and sea wall damaged. Damage across Lukunor and nearby islands amounted to $20,000.|$|E

5|$|Bethlehem paid {{taxes on}} wheat, barley and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were {{organized}} into separate communities, each having its own leader.

5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded on dry land.|$|E

The free fatty acid content of dried fruit bodies was 4.5%, <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> than the common button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), which had 3.5%.
