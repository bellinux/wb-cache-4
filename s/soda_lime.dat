5|$|Boron is {{primarily}} used in chemical compounds. About {{half of all}} boron consumed globally is an additive in fiberglass for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, lightweight structural and refractory materials. Borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> glass. Boron compounds are used as fertilizers in agriculture and in sodium perborate bleaches. A small amount of boron {{is used as a}} dopant in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.|$|E

Originally thought to possess less hepatotoxicity than chloroform, and without the unpleasant pungency and flammability of ether, TCE use was nonetheless soon found to have several pitfalls. These included promotion of cardiac arrhythmias, low volatility and high solubility preventing quick anesthetic induction, reactions with <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> used in carbon dioxide absorbing systems, prolonged neurologic dysfunction when used with <b>soda</b> <b>lime,</b> and evidence of hepatotoxicity as had been found with chloroform.|$|E

25|$|Methane can be {{produced}} by the destructive distillation of acetic acid {{in the presence of}} <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> or similar. Acetic acid is decarboxylated in this process. Methane can be prepared from aluminium carbide by reaction with water or strong acids. It is also made by reducing a solution of methanol and concentrated hydrochloric acid with iron powder, giving water and ferrous chloride as byproducts.|$|E
25|$|Oaxaca woodcarvings {{were all}} {{originally}} painted with aniline paints made with natural ingredients such as bark of the copal tree, baking <b>soda,</b> <b>lime</b> juice, pomegranate seeds, zinc, indigo, huitlacoche and cochineal. These colorings {{were also used}} for dying clothing, ceremonial paints and other uses. Since 1985, most carvers have now switched to acrylics which resist fading and withstand repeated cleanings better. However, some still use aniline paints as they have a more rustic look that some customers prefer. Either way, the painting is generally done in two layers, with a solid undercoat and a multicolored designed superimposed.|$|E
25|$|To flush the machine, first remove or disable the vaporizers {{and then}} flush the machine with 10 L/min or greater fresh {{gas flow rate}} for at least 20 minutes. While {{flushing}} the machine the ventilator should be set to periodically ventilate a new breathing circuit. The <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> should also be replaced. After machine preparation, anesthesia should be induced and maintained with non-triggering agents. The time required to flush a machine varies for different machines and volatile anesthetics. This prevention technique was optimized to prepare older generation anesthesia machines. Modern anesthetic machines have more rubber and plastic components which provide a reservoir for volatile anesthetics, and should be flushed for 60 minutes.|$|E

25|$|The most {{successful}} artisan is Jacobo Angeles, whose work have been prominently displayed at The Smithsonian and the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago. It {{can also be}} found in numerous museums, art colleges and galleries in the world. Jacobo learned to carve from his father when he was twelve, and later was mentored by elders in his and other communities. While alebrijes designs have been innovative and incorporating modern elements, the Angeles family’s designs focus on representations of Zapotec culture. This {{can be seen in the}} painted designs, based on influences such as the friezes of Mitla, and other ancient symbols as well as the continued use in aniline paints made from natural ingredients such as the bark of the copal tree, baking <b>soda,</b> <b>lime</b> juice, pomegranate seeds, zinc, indigo, huitlacoche and cochineal. Each year, Jacobo travels the United States to promote Oaxacan folk art in general to educational institution as well as a speaker at art institutions.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{compressing}} gas into a diving cylinder removes {{moisture from the}} gas. This is good for corrosion prevention in the cylinder but means that the diver inhales very dry gas. The dry gas extracts moisture from the diver's lungs while underwater contributing to dehydration, which is also {{thought to be a}} predisposing risk factor of decompression sickness. It is also uncomfortable, causing a dry mouth and throat and making the diver thirsty. This problem is reduced in rebreathers because the <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> reaction, which removes carbon dioxide, also puts moisture back into the breathing gas. In hot climates, open circuit diving can accelerate heat exhaustion because of dehydration. Another concern with regard to moisture content is the tendency of moisture to condense as the gas is decompressed while passing through the regulator; this coupled with the extreme reduction in temperature, also due to the decompression can cause the moisture to solidify as ice. This icing up in a regulator can cause moving parts to seize and the regulator to fail or free flow.|$|E
500|$|Although pure silica is a {{perfectly}} viable glass and glass fiber, it must be worked with at very high temperatures, which is a drawback unless its specific chemical properties are needed. It is usual to introduce impurities into the glass {{in the form of}} other materials to lower its working temperature. These materials also impart various other properties to the glass that may be beneficial in different applications. The first type of glass used for fiber was <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> glass or A-glass ("A" [...] for the alkali it contains). It is not very resistant to alkali. A newer, alkali-free (<2%) type, E-glass, is an alumino-borosilicate glass. C-glass was developed to resist attack from chemicals, mostly acids that destroy E-glass. T-glass is a North American variant of C-glass. AR-glass is alkali-resistant glass. Most glass fibers have limited solubility in water but are very dependent on pH. Chloride ions will also attack and dissolve E-glass surfaces.|$|E

500|$|Pure silica (silicon dioxide), when cooled as {{fused quartz}} {{into a glass}} with no true melting point, {{can be used as}} a glass fiber for fiberglass, but has the {{drawback}} that it must be worked at very high temperatures. In order to lower the necessary work temperature, other materials are introduced as [...] "fluxing agents" [...] (i.e., components to lower the melting point). Ordinary A-glass ("A" [...] for [...] "alkali-lime") or <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> glass, crushed and ready to be remelted, as so-called cullet glass, was the first type of glass used for fiberglass. E-glass ("E" [...] because of initial electrical application), is alkali free, and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation. It now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world, and also is the single largest consumer of boron minerals globally. It is susceptible to chloride ion attack and is a poor choice for marine applications. S-glass ("S" [...] for [...] "Strength") is used when high tensile strength (modulus) is important, and is thus important in composites for building and aircraft construction. The same substance is known as R-glass ("R" [...] for [...] "reinforcement") in Europe. C-glass ("C" [...] for [...] "chemical resistance") and T-glass ("T" [...] is for [...] "thermal insulator" [...] – a North American variant of C-glass) are resistant to chemical attack; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass.|$|E

2500|$|The {{manufacture}} of glass {{is one of the}} most important uses of sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate acts as a flux for silica, lowering the melting point of the mixture to something achievable without special materials. This [...] "soda glass" [...] is mildly water-soluble, so some calcium carbonate is added to the melt mixture to make the glass produced insoluble. This type of glass is known as <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> glass: [...] "soda" [...] for the sodium carbonate and [...] "lime" [...] for the calcium carbonate. <b>Soda</b> <b>lime</b> glass has been the most common form of glass for centuries.|$|E
50|$|But {{whether this}} “fritting” {{was done in}} antiquity as a {{deliberate}} step {{in the manufacture of}} raw glass remains questionable.
