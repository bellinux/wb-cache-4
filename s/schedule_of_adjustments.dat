40|$|The authors {{investigated}} {{the factors that}} influenced the participation of sub - Saharan African countries and all low-income countries in World Bank adjustment lending. They estimated how the Bank's adjustment programs affected economic performance in both regions. They found that the marginal contribution <b>of</b> Bank-supported <b>adjustment</b> programs to export performance has been postive and significant in sub - Saharan Africa, given the potentially important links between export growth and economic growth. But adjustment programs have not significantly affected economic growth in sub - Saharan Africa and have had a deleterious effect on investment there. This strengthens theargument of those who call for more explicit consideration of the initial conditions of the sub - Saharan African economies in the design, emphasis, and <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> their <b>adjustment</b> programs.

Congress required that the accounts be audited and reconciled before the Bureau of Indian Affairs transferred funds to a third party. Interior's fiscal year 1990 appropriations act added a requirement that the accounts be reconciled to the earliest possible date and that Interior obtain an independent certification of the reconciliation work. The American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 required Interior to provide tribes with reconciled account statements as of September 30, 1995. To fulfill these requirements, Interior contracted with two major independent public accounting firms, one to reconcile the trust accounts {{and the other to}} do an independent certification of the reconciliation. When Interior's reconciliation project was completed in January 1996, each tribe was provided a report that included unreconciled account statements with <b>schedules</b> <b>of</b> proposed <b>adjustments</b> based on results for each year of the five-year reconciliation. Later that year, GAO reported shortcomings in Interior's reconciliation project.

40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) specifications to {{air traffic management}} has resulted in many benefits during nominal operations, including shorter flight paths, reduced fuel costs, and improved terminal area arrival rates. However, these benefits become less noticeable during off-nominal operations where aircraft are routinely interrupted from staying on PBN procedures due to disturbances such as missed approaches. This human-in-the-loop (HITL) study used multiple types of disturbance events to perturb the arrival schedule. Perturbed schedules were managed with different types <b>of</b> <b>schedule</b> <b>adjustments,</b> including a condition with no adjustments. The study collected data {{on a host of}} dependent variables, including human factors measures on controller workload and system performance measures such as schedule nonconformance (nc). Initial analyses showed strong correlations between aggregated controller workload and aggregated nc, as well as benefits of both automatic and manual schedule adjustments for increasing system performance, such as reduced PBN procedure interruptions. The goal {{of this paper is to}} further test these initial findings. The results indicated that an increase in schedule nonconformance correlated with an increase in controller workload at specific time intervals, and automated schedule adjustments consistently reduced controller workload associated with nonconformance...|$|R
40|$|Occupancy {{information}} is commonly {{regarded as an}} important ingredient for energy efficient building climate control. In {{a recent study of}} the authors, the energy savings potential of using long-term occupancy information (in the range of days) in the control of office buildings was investigated, assuming a geometric distribution of occupancy and vacancy intervals. In this work, the findings of the previous study are validated by considering real occupancy data from an office building in Switzerland. The study is based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, which enables a direct comparability between different controllers. Assuming a perfect model, MPC {{can be thought of as}} an upper bound on the performance of any controller and hence directly yields the value of occupancy information. The study compares the energy use of an MPC controller having three variants of occupancy information but the same occupancy realization.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{assesses the}} {{resilience}} <b>of</b> <b>scheduled</b> Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) arrival operations. Resilience {{is defined as}} an ability to return to nominal operations following a schedule perturbation. Results from a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) experiment that included off-nominal events to perturb the schedule are described. The schedule comes from a precision trajectory-based arrival manager. The experiment collected data regarding the response to perturbed schedules in three conditions, where: 1) a disturbance rejection algorithm made schedule adjustments automatically, 2) a Traffic Management Coordinator (TMC) participant made schedule adjustments manually, or 3) no schedule adjustments were made. Analyses showed that the simulation’s scheduled PBN operations have inherent resilience, recovering from more than half <b>of</b> the perturbed <b>schedules</b> even with no schedule adjustments. Resilience to the same off-nominal events improved with schedule adjustments; an increased proportion <b>of</b> perturbed <b>schedules</b> recovered within the length of operation run, and the average duration <b>of</b> the <b>schedule’s</b> perturbed state decreased. Compared to the manual schedule adjustments condition, a greater number <b>of</b> <b>schedule</b> <b>adjustments</b> occurred for the same off-nominal events in the automated condition. However, perturbed schedules were recovered more frequently and perturbations were less severe in the automated condition. Subjective and objective workload in the manual and the automated schedule adjustment conditions were similar to the no schedule adjustment condition.

40|$|This {{research}} contains three essays that {{explore the}} speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment,</b> volatility and {{noise in the}} Indonesia Stock Exchange. The first essay explores the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the Indonesia Stock Exchange at daily interval from 2000 to 2004. The model employed is the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> with noise. Firstly, I work on the estimation of the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The estimated speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> coefficient concludes that the large size leads the smaller size group to adjust to new information. Secondly, I analyse the component in the noise that contributes significantly to the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> level. It is confirmed that the factor determining the noise is bid-ask fluctuations. Therefore, {{it is reasonable to}} infer the component in the noise from bid-ask component. The decomposition of bid-ask spread into transaction cost and asymmetric information reveals that the latter is found to be a significant component determining the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> level. The second essay analyses the fine grain dynamics of the speed <b>of</b> price <b>adjustment</b> to new information from 2000 to 2007. The exact time <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is estimated at intraday frequency instead of at daily frequency. In this work, as an alternative of first moment estimation, second moment model-free estimation using volatility signature plot to estimate of the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is proposed. Both first and second moment estimation of the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> provide consistent result <b>of</b> 30 minute <b>adjustment</b> period. Negative relation after 5 -minute return interval between speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> estimate and realized variance is found implying lower noise leads to smaller deviation between observed and equilibrium price. In the third essay, I concentrate the work on the second moment of continuously compounded returns from 2000 to 2007 in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The main purpose of the last essay is to estimate the noise and efficient variance in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The realized variance based estimator is employed in the third essay. During the period of the study, noise variance decreases indicating smaller deviation between the observed and equilibrium price, hence improving market quality in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The optimal frequency to estimate the efficient variance, on average, is nine minutes. The variance ratio of daily efficient variance to daily open-to-close reveals significant private information underlying price process in the Indonesia Stock Exchange...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Research {{has shown}} that {{individuals}} reporting a low level <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude, defined as having few possibilities to temporarily adjust work demands to illness, have {{a higher risk of}} sick leave. To what extent lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude influences the individual when making the decision to take sick leave is unknown. We hypothesize that ill individuals are more likely to take sick leave on days when they experience a lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude at work than on days with access to adjustment latitude. Methods: A case-crossover design was applied to 546 sick-leave spells, extracted from a cohort of 1 430 employees at six Swedish workplaces, with a 3 - 12 month follow-up of all new sick-leave spells. Exposure to lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude on the first sick-leave day was compared with exposure during several types of control periods sampled from the previous two months for the same individual. Results: Only 35 % of the respondents reported variations in access to adjustment latitude, and 19 % reported a constant lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude during the two weeks prior to the sick-leave spell. Among those that did report variation, the risk of sick leave was lower on days with lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude, than on days with access (Odds Ratio 0. 36, 95 % Confidence Interval 0. 25 - 0. 52).

A characteristic feature of the second level <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is the past association with local cultural institutions and the present participation in cultural institutions of more universal character. A determinant of the third level <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is cultural superficiality and syncretism.
