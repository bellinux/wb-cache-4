40|$|Abstract. Following the {{pioneering}} work of Prof. Hermann A.

Fiber Bragg grating solitons {{are found to be}} automatically amplitude squeezed after passing through the grating and the <b>squeezing</b> <b>ratio</b> saturates after a certain grating length. The optimal <b>squeezing</b> <b>ratio</b> occurs when the pulse energy is slightly above the fundamental soliton energy. One can also compress the soliton pulsewidth and enhance the squeezing simultaneously by using an apodized grating, as long as the solitons evolve adiabatically...|$|R

40|$|We study quantum {{correlations}} and {{quantum noise}} in the soliton collision described by a general two-soliton solution of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, by using the back-propagation method. Our results include the standard case of a sech-shaped initial pulse analyzed earlier. We reveal that double-hump initial pulses can get more squeezed, and the <b>squeezing</b> <b>ratio</b> enhancement {{is due to the}} long collision period in which the pulses are more stationary. These results offer promising possibilities of using higher-order solitons to generate strongly squeezed states for the quantum information process and quantum computation.

40|$|Small quantum {{fluctuations}} in solitons {{described by the}} cubic-quintic nonlinear Schrödinger equation (CQNLSE) are studied with the linear approximation. The cases of both self-defocusing and self-focusing quintic term are considered (in the latter case, solitons may be effectively stable, despite the possibility of collapse). The numerically implemented back-propagation method {{is used to calculate}} the optimal <b>squeezing</b> <b>ratio</b> for the quantum fluctuations vs. the propagation distance. In the case of the self-defocusing quintic nonlinearity, opposite signs in front of the cubic and quintic terms make the fluctuations around bistable pairs of solitons (which have different energies for the same width) totally different. The fluctuations around nonstationary Gaussian pulses in the CQNLSE model are studied too. Comment: submitted t J. Opt. B for publis...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} experimental investigations on determination of pressure force of power fluid-jet stream on plane surfaces of specimens having various shape. The results permit efficiently to realize {{a number of}} technological processes which directly depend on quality of surface cleaning from corrosion. A principle diagram has been developed for a dynamometer {{in order to measure}} a force F acting on the machined specimen with measuring range from 0 to 50 N and an error which constitutes 2 % of maximum value of the measured load. Two diagrams for jet stream flow after its interaction with the specimen have been proposed for a comparative analysis while measuring force F, namely: radial fluid spreading at angle β = 90 ° and reversible stream flow due to one-eighty stream turn after its interaction with plane surface of the specimen. Methodology has been established for registration of force F on plane specimens having various shape. Pressure at the nozzle input р в х, i and distance L i from the nozzle to the machined surface of the specimen have been taken as variable parameters for both loading diagrams (β = 90 ° and 180 °). Investigation results have made it possible to determine that usage of reversible stream flow ensures maximum force action on plane surface of the specimen in the investigated range of pressures р в х   = 3. 5 – 10. 0 MPa and distances from nozzle to the machined surface L = 8 – 30 mm. In this case maximum action force (irrespective of pressure at input р в х  and distance from nozzle to the machined surface L) is observed at stream <b>squeezing</b> <b>ratio</b> λ = 0. 063 and this effect is attributed to optimum ratio of cavity diameter D 0 and stream diameter d c тр. The obtained results allow reasonably to select pump equipment and efficiently execute technology for cleaning plane surfaces from corrosion with due account of stream <b>squeezing</b> <b>ratio</b> λ which is taken as a criterion. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{photonic}} crystal fiber for realizing the effect of low dispersion high birefringence is proposed The filet is composed of a solid silica core and a cladding with squeezed-hexagonal-lattice elliptical air-hole along the fiber length. Dispersion and birefringence are investigated simultaneously by using the full vectorial plane wave method Simulations indicate that the wavelength for realizing low-dispersion high-birefringence can be controlled by artificially choosing the structure parameters of photonic crystal fiber, such as the hexagonal lattice <b>squeezing</b> <b>ratio,</b> the relative an hole spacing and the air hole ellipticity.

40|$|In {{this article}} {{the ability to}} record, store, and read out the quantum {{properties}} of light is studied. The discussion is based on high-speed and adiabatic models of quantum memory in lambda-configuration and {{in the limit of}} strong resonance. We show that in this case the equality between efficiency and <b>squeezing</b> <b>ratio,</b> predicted by the simple beamsplitter model, is broken. The requirement of the maximum squeezing in the output pulse should not be accompanied by the requirement of maximum efficiency of memory, as in the beamsplitter model. We have demonstrated a high output pulse squeezing, when the efficiency reached only about 50 %. Comprehension of this "paradox" is achieved on the basis of mode analysis. The memories eigenmodes, which {{have an impact on the}} memory process, are found numerically. Also, the spectral analysis of modes was performed to match the spectral width of the input signal to the capacities of the memories. Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures, RevTeX 4. Submitted to Phys.

40|$|Two path {{interferometry}} with coherent {{states and}} squeezed vacuum can achieve phase sensitivities {{close to the}} Heisenberg limit when the average photon number of the squeezed vacuum {{is close to the}} average photon number of the coherent light. Here, we investigate the phase sensitivity of such states in the presence of photon losses. It is shown that the Cramer-Rao bound of phase sensitivity can be achieved experimentally by using a weak local oscillator and photon counting in the output. The phase sensitivity is then given by the Fisher information F of the state. In the limit of high <b>squeezing,</b> the <b>ratio</b> (F-N) /N^ 2 of Fisher information above shot noise to the square of the average photon number N depends only on the average number of photons lost, n_loss, and the fraction of squeezed vacuum photons mu. For mu= 1 / 2, the effect of losses is given by (F-N) /N^ 2 = 1 /(1 + 2 n_loss). The possibility of increasing the robustness against losses by lowering the squeezing fraction mu is considered and an optimized result is derived. However, the improvements are rather small, with a maximal improvement by a factor of two at high losses. Comment: 7 pages, including 6 figure...|$|R

The widescreen movie image was stretched to fill the entire video frame with less or none of the video resolution wasted to create letterbox bars.

This same procedure was used for anamorphic DVDs, but unlike all DVD players, very few LD players had the ability to unsqueeze the image for 4:3 sets, and very few if any 4:3 sets could be set to play them properly either. If the discs were played on a standard 4:3 television the image would be distorted. Since very few people outside of Japan owned 16:9 displays, the marketability of these special discs was very limited.|$|R
