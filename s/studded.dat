5000|$|With {{respect to}} shape, <b>stud</b> bolts a.k.a <b>studs</b> are {{categorized}} into 3 basic types: [...] "Fully Threaded <b>Stud</b> Bolts", [...] "Tap End <b>Stud</b> Bolts", and [...] "Double End <b>Stud</b> Bolts". Each of these <b>studs</b> have different application. As name suggests, fully threaded <b>studs</b> have full body coverage with threads for full engagement of the matings nuts or similar parts. Tap end <b>studs</b> have threads at extreme {{ends of the}} body with unequal thread engagement length, while double end <b>stud</b> bolts have equal thread length at both ends. Apart from these there are <b>stud</b> bolts for flanges which are fully threaded <b>studs</b> with chamfered ends, and double end <b>studs</b> with reduced shank for special bolting applications.For <b>studs</b> that are not completely threaded, {{there are two types}} of studs: full-bodied <b>studs,</b> and undercut <b>studs.</b> Full-bodied <b>studs</b> have a shank equal to the major diameter of the thread. Undercut <b>studs</b> have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the screw thread. Undercut <b>studs</b> are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied <b>stud</b> the stresses are greater in the threads than in the shank.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1970s, Ampeg had {{a line of}} Japanese-made {{guitars and}} basses under the [...] "Stud" [...] name. The guitars {{included}} the <b>Stud,</b> Heavy <b>Stud,</b> and Super <b>Stud,</b> and the basses included the Big <b>Stud</b> and Little <b>Stud.</b> The <b>Studs</b> were knock-offs of popular Fender and Gibson instruments. Some of the <b>Stud</b> instruments were poorly built (e.g. the plywood bodies and necks on the Little <b>Stud),</b> while others had good-quality features (e.g., gold-plated hardware on the Super <b>Stud).</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>stud</b> finder (also <b>stud</b> {{detector}} or <b>stud</b> sensor) is {{a handheld}} device used to locate framing <b>studs</b> located behind the final walling surface, usually drywall. While {{there are many}} different <b>stud</b> finders available, most fall into two main categories: magnetic <b>stud</b> detectors and electric <b>stud</b> finders. Some newer technologies exist such as RF radar with 3D imaging technology.|$|R
5|$|The Botanical Gardens of the National Art Gallery {{is popular}} for {{afternoon}} strolls, and is {{noted for its}} orchids and shrubs. It houses a herbarium, a lily <b>studded</b> waterbody, well-planned walkways, and the Watapamu village, representing a typical village of the islands, which is named after the water pump located nearby. An Anthropology Museum is also located in Honiara, which has exhibits of recent origin.|$|E

Navy blue shorts are worn for years one and two, and long pants for upper secondary levels. The six metal buttons bearing the school name is sewed onto the shirt as a modification to the traditional design adopted by other traditional Chinese schools, where rings were used to secure the buttons. Fe{{male students}} wear white blouses bearing the Traditional Chinese characters of the school name on it in red, with navy blue pleated skirts. During Assemblies and important functions, every student will wear a red-coloured school tie.|$|E
5|$|Elisabeth and her Spanish entourage {{had arrived}} at the Bidasoa river on the Spanish border with a huge escort of French Catholic nobles on 14 June 1565. She then rode into Saint-Jean de Luz, where Catherine greeted her tearfully with embraces and kisses. During the {{reception}} ceremonies, ten of Catherine’s soldiers dropped dead from standing too long in the heat in their armour. The next day, Elisabeth made a dazzling entry into Bayonne on a horse whose harness was <b>studded</b> with gems worth 400,000 ducats.|$|E
50|$|Instant <b>stud</b> finders are {{a recent}} innovation. Instant <b>stud</b> finders have {{multiple}} sensor plates, {{and do not}} need to be moved across the wall to detect a <b>stud,</b> overcoming the effects of bumpy wall texture. They use an algorithm to analyze the readings from the multiple sensor plates for a quicker, more accurate indication. Instant <b>stud</b> finders sense multiple regions of a wall simultaneously including the center of a <b>stud,</b> edges of the <b>stud,</b> and regions without <b>studs.</b> Instant <b>stud</b> finders will indicate varied widths of <b>studs</b> and the location of multiple <b>studs</b> at the same time.|$|R

5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is <b>studded</b> with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.|$|E
5|$|On November 20 the Chinese Army {{and teams}} of conscripted laborers began to hurriedly bolster Nanking's {{defenses}} {{both inside and}} outside the city. Nanking itself was surrounded by formidable stone walls stretching almost fifty kilometers (31 miles) around the entire city. The walls, which had been constructed hundreds of years earlier during the Ming Dynasty, rose up to twenty meters (65 feet) in height, were nine meters (30 feet) thick, and had been <b>studded</b> with machine gun emplacements. By December 6 all the gates into the city had been closed and then barricaded with an additional layer of sandbags and concrete six meters (20 feet) thick.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of Maria Portinari {{is a small}} c. 1470–72 tempera and oil on wood {{painting}} by Hans Memling. It portrays Maria Maddalena Baroncelli, about whom very little is known. She is aged about 14 years old, and depicted shortly before her wedding to the Italian banker Tommaso Portinari. Maria is dressed in the height of late fifteenth-century fashion, with a long black hennin with a transparent veil and an elaborate jewel <b>studded</b> necklace. Her headdress is similar and necklace identical to those in her depiction in Hugo van der Goes's later Portinari Altarpiece (c. 1475), a painting {{that may have been}} partly based on Memling's portrait.|$|E

50|$|A {{building}} technique mostly associated with Lincolnshire, England, {{and parts of}} Scotland gets part of {{its name from the}} studs: mud and <b>stud</b> (<b>stud</b> and mud). This building method uses <b>studs</b> in a framework which is then totally covered with mud which resembles the building material cob. Another traditional building method is called <b>stud</b> and plaster where the plaster walls are held by lath on the <b>studs.</b> <b>Studs</b> are also the namesake of a type of timber framing called close <b>studding.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since 1998, many {{developments}} and improvements {{have been made}} to the internal capacitor <b>stud</b> finders and increased their popularity. Recent innovators developed <b>stud</b> finders with multiple sensor plates that sense the wall in multiple places instantly. These sensors can indicate the location, width, and lack of <b>studs</b> simultaneously. With more sensors, these instant <b>stud</b> finders avoid the shortcomings of previous electronic <b>stud</b> finders, which require calibration and do not adapt to inconsistencies in wall construction. While the instant <b>stud</b> finders have made finding <b>studs</b> an easy and efficient task, many people still use magnetic <b>stud</b> detectors.|$|R
5|$|Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, {{is widely}} celebrated with festive family meals and {{symbolic}} foods. Sweetness {{is the main}} theme and the Rosh Hashana dinners typically begin with apples dipped in honey, and end with honey cake. The challah is usually round, often <b>studded</b> with raisins and drizzled with honey, and other symbolic fruits and vegetables are eaten as an entree, such as pomegranates, carrots, leeks and beets. Fish dishes, symbolizing abundance, are served; for example, gefilte fish is traditional for Ashkenazim, while Moroccan Jews prepare the spicy fish dish, chraime. Honey cake (lekach) is often served as dessert, accompanied by tea or coffee.|$|E
5|$|The inner {{mitochondrial}} membrane is compartmentalized into numerous cristae, which expand {{the surface area}} of the inner {{mitochondrial membrane}}, enhancing its ability to produce ATP. For typical liver mitochondria, {{the area of the}} inner membrane is about five times as large as the outer membrane. This ratio is variable and mitochondria from cells that have a greater demand for ATP, such as muscle cells, contain even more cristae. These folds are <b>studded</b> with small round bodies known as F1 particles or oxysomes. These are not simple random folds but rather invaginations of the inner membrane, which can affect overall chemiosmotic function.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear envelope, {{otherwise}} known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged {{parallel to one another}} and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and is similarly <b>studded</b> with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.|$|E
40|$|<b>Stud</b> {{plunge depth}} {{is one of}} the {{important}} welding conditions in arc <b>stud</b> welding. With the analysis of the <b>stud</b> plunge process, the control of <b>stud</b> plunge depth in the stepping arc <b>stud</b> welding was studied. The extrusion pressure between the <b>stud</b> and the workpiece during welding process is acted as the controlled variable. And a control system based on a displacement sensor was developed. It is indicated from the welding test results that the autocontrol of <b>stud</b> plunge depth using displacement sensor can be realized in stepping arc <b>stud</b> welding. The <b>stud</b> plunge depth {{does not need to be}} set before welding, which will redound to the automaticity of welding process...|$|R

5000|$|A state <b>stud</b> farm (Landgestüt, Haras) is {{one that}} is owned by the government. The first state <b>studs</b> were ordered by Louis XIV of France in 1665. The purpose of the state <b>studs</b> was to make {{high-quality}} horses available to local breeders and farmers to accelerate the evolution of local horses. <b>Stud</b> farms which kept a herd of mares in addition to stallions were dubbed [...] "Principal" [...] <b>Studs.</b> State-owned stallions were made accessible with low or no <b>stud</b> fees. Germany is most famous for its Principal and State <b>Studs,</b> which have been instrumental in the shaping of the German riding horses and several breeds of German cold bloods. The Hanoverian is associated with the State <b>Stud</b> of Celle, the Rhinelander and Westphalian with the State <b>Stud</b> of Warendorf, the Brandenburger with the Principal <b>Stud</b> of Neustadt an der Dosse, and so on.|$|R
5|$|The skin of E. rabborum was {{granular}} in {{texture and}} predominantly a mottled brown. The upper {{surfaces of the}} limbs was also mottled brown while the rear surfaces of the thighs were a pale yellow. The chin and upper chest was distinctively brown, though {{the rest of the}} underside of the body was mostly white speckled with irregular brown spots. The eyelids and upper surfaces of the limbs and back were <b>studded</b> with green flecks, the appearance and positions of which could be changed by the animal voluntarily (metachrosis). The irises of the eyes was uniformly reddish brown.|$|E
5|$|Anggun's {{image has}} been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the early stage of her career as a rock singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a crooked beret, shorts, <b>studded</b> jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising her long black hair and brown skin. For this look she utilises the work of fashion designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the French version of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E
5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a <b>studded</b> leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>stud</b> farms make male animals {{available}} for breeding to outside female {{animals that are}} not owned by the <b>stud</b> farm. Doing so provides an outside source of revenue to a <b>stud</b> farm via the <b>stud</b> fees paid to obtain the services of the <b>stud</b> animal as well as contributing to the overall genetic diversity of the animal's offspring. At state <b>stud</b> farms, <b>stud</b> service {{is not only a}} source of income, but due to the high standards set for breeding animals, has an overall effect of improving the quality of animals throughout an area.|$|R

5|$|Beginning around 1238, {{the castle}} was {{expanded}} to the east, north, and north-west. The work lasted through {{the reign of}} HenryIII and into that of EdwardI, interrupted occasionally by civil unrest. New creations included a new defensive perimeter, <b>studded</b> with towers, while on the west, north, and east sides, where the wall was not defended by the river, a defensive ditch was dug. The eastern extension took the castle {{beyond the bounds of}} the old Roman settlement, marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle's defences. The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression, despised by Londoners, and Henry's building programme was unpopular. So when the gatehouse collapsed in 1240, the locals celebrated the setback. The expansion caused disruption locally and £166 was paid to St Katherine's Hospital and the prior of Holy Trinity in compensation.|$|E
5|$|Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller {{undertook}} a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall <b>studded</b> with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers {{on the eastern}} side, {{and there was a}} postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The lay of the land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.|$|E
5|$|Modern winter service {{vehicles}} will usually {{also have a}} satellite navigation system connected to a weather forecast feed, allowing the driver to choose the best areas to treat and to avoid areas in which rain is likely, which can wash away the grit used—the most advanced can even adapt to changing conditions, ensuring optimal gritter and plow settings. Most run on wheels, often with snow chains or <b>studded</b> tires, but some are mounted on caterpillar tracks, with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards {{the side of the}} road. Off-road winter {{service vehicles}} mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as snowcats. Snowcats are commonly fitted with snowplows or snow groomers, and are used by ski resorts to smooth and maintain pistes and snowmobile runs, although they can also be used as a replacement for chairlifts.|$|E
