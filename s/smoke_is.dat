5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> carbon monoxide (which poisons the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin). Dudley rejected the popularly held opinion that cigarette smoke was harmful due to the adulteration of the tobacco, e. g. with opium. His experiments showed the toxic agent to be carbon monoxide, resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} {{reaction of}} TiCl4 is its easy hydrolysis, signaled by {{the release of}} hydrogen chloride {{and the formation of}} titanium oxides and oxychlorides, as described above for the production of TiO2. Titanium tetrachloride has been used to create naval smokescreens. The hydrogen chloride immediately absorbs water to form an aerosol of hydrochloric acid that efficiently scatter light. In addition, the highly refractive titanium dioxide is also an efficient light scatterer. This <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> however corrosive.|$|E
5|$|Also {{developed}} by Probe Entertainment, the Sega Game Gear and Master System ports {{are similar to}} the Game Boy port, but in color instead of in monochrome. Both of them are almost identical, except for the reduced size of the Game Gear screen, featuring the same fighters and arenas as the Game Boy port, but with the addition of Kintaro. The arena where players fight Jade and <b>Smoke</b> <b>is</b> exclusive to each version. Unlike the Game Boy version, blood is present, but was drastically reduced in quantity when compared to other ports. Because of the systems' limited graphical resources, some of the Fatalities in the game were altered to completely destroy the opponent's body, leaving generic gibs of bones and limbs, while others were also simplified to use common animations.|$|E
40|$|Effect {{of diesel}} fuel {{properties}} on generation {{of blue and}} white <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> investigated experimentally. Three types of diesel fuels (JIS# 2, JIS SP# 3 and GTL) were evaporated by a simple fuel vaporization device, and the concentration and color of the generated <b>smokes</b> <b>were</b> evaluated by a light transmitting smoke meter and visual observation, respectively. Concentration of blue and white <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> the highest for the JIS# 2, followed by the JIS SP# 3 and the GTL. White <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> observed at a low evaporation temperature, whereas blue <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> observed under high evaporation temperature conditions.

5|$|Millipedes {{appear in}} {{folklore}} and traditional medicine around the world. Some cultures associate millipede activity with coming rains. In the Yoruba culture of Nigeria, millipedes {{are used in}} pregnancy and business rituals, and crushed millipedes are used to treat fever, whitlow, and convulsion in children. In Zambia, smashed millipede pulp is used to treat wounds, and the Bafia people of Cameroon use millipede juice to treat earache. In certain Himalayan Bhotiya tribes, dry millipede <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> used to treat haemorrhoids. Native people in Malaysia use millipede secretions in poison-tipped arrows. The secretions of Spirobolus bungii have been observed to inhibit division of human cancer cells. The only recorded usage of millipedes as food by humans comes from the Bobo people of Burkina Faso, who consume boiled, dried millipedes in tomato sauce.|$|E
5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding method {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.|$|E
5|$|The first chorus has Koda {{walking through}} the land, and scenes of her singing. She grabs a compass, {{but it does not}} {{function}} properly. She grabs a drinking bottle, but only filled with little droplets; she tries to drink it, but falls all on her face instead. As she sings the song; {{by the end of the}} second chorus, black projectile <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> scene falling from the sky in the distance and hits parts of the abandoned city. As more smoke falls and black leaves con-stellate, Koda collapses and sings the bridge on the ground. When the bridge section ends, rocks start levitating and the smoke rises, forming a black Dust devil in the distance. As more dust devil's form, they become large and closely devour Koda.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary risk}} factor for COPD {{globally}} is tobacco smoking. Of those who smoke about 20% will get COPD, and {{of those who are}} lifelong smokers about half will get COPD. In the United States and United Kingdom, of those with COPD, 80–95% are either current smokers or previously smoked. The likelihood of developing COPD increases with the total smoke exposure. Additionally, women are more susceptible to the harmful effects of smoke than men. In non-smokers, secondhand <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> the cause of about 20% of cases. Other types of smoke, such as, marijuana, cigar, and water pipe smoke, also confer a risk. Water pipe smoke appears to be as harmful as smoking cigarettes. Problems from marijuana smoke may only be with heavy use. Women who smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of COPD in their child. For the same amount of cigarette smoking, women have a higher risk of COPD than men.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine quality of smoked catfish (Arius thalassinus) using paddy chaff and coconut shell liquid <b>smoke.</b> The fish <b>were</b> divided into two groups; then processed using paddy chaff and coconut shell liquid smoke. All of the <b>smoked</b> catfish samples <b>were</b> subjected to chemical, microbiological and organoleptic analyses. The result indicated that moisture content of the paddy chaff <b>smoked</b> cat fish <b>was</b> 48. 72 %; a little bit lower than coconut shell smoked cat fish that was 51. 27 %. TPC on paddy chaff treatment was 53. 33 CFU/gr; higher than coconut shell treatment that was 46. 67 CFU/gr. Organoleptic value of smoked cat fish treated by paddy chaff liquid <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> 8. 26 and coconut shell was 8. 22. It was found that benzo(α) pyrene content in the paddy chaff liquid <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> not detected and in the coconut shell liquid <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> 11. 351 ppm.

25|$|The {{carcinogenity}} {{of tobacco}} <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> not explained by nicotine per se, {{which is not}} carcinogenic or mutagenic, although it is a metabolic precursor for several compounds which are.

25|$|A {{dozen or}} more {{detectors}} may be connected via wiring or wirelessly such that if one detects smoke, the alarms will sound on all the detectors in the network, improving the likelihood that occupants will be alerted even if <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> detected far from their location.
