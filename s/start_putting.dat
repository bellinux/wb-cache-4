They would <b>start</b> <b>putting</b> boats through starting around 4 a.m. (dawn), and go all day long until 10 p.m., often consisting of boatmen who had gone through that morning, unloaded in Newark, and were returning.|$|E

The boat completed two trips, putting ashore a total of 63 people including eight women, three babies {{and a number of}} elderly men. Then the rough sea disabled the boat and it was stranded on the beach. They were left with no shelter and only the boat's water and food rations to sustain them. Another 42 people, including Captain Lee, were left aboard the beached ship.|$|E

This triggered a collapse, with Trent Boult picking up five wickets in the first three overs of his second spell. Australia were left struggling at 106/9 at the end of 22 overs, before Brad Haddin and Pat Cummins put on 45 runs for the 10th wicket to take the Australian total to 151.|$|E
25|$|Lusitanias severe {{starboard}} list {{complicated the}} launch of her lifeboats. Ten minutes after the torpedoing, when she had slowed enough to <b>start</b> <b>putting</b> boats in the water, the lifeboats on the starboard side swung out too far to step aboard safely. While it was still possible to board the lifeboats on the port side, lowering them presented a different problem. As was typical for the period, the hull plates of Lusitania were riveted, and as the lifeboats were lowered they dragged on the inch high rivets, which threatened to seriously damage the boats before they landed in the water.|$|E

He also stated that the album would be recorded at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado and produced by Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore, who had produced The Sufferer & the Witness. Also in May 2008, Rise Against posted a blog on their website, stating that they were back in the studio working on the album. It explained that they had [...] "spent many weeks in Chicago throughout the end of winter writing new songs" [...] in their [...] "rehearsal space". Asked later about the writing and recording process, McIlrath said, [...] "We kind of blocked a month off over the winter and said, 'Let's all get together, get the rehearsal space, and <b>start</b> <b>putting</b> some ideas together,' which is what we did. And then, we also blocked off a week or two at the Blasting Room after we arrived in Fort Collins to just kind of jam stuff out, get some new ideas going." ...|$|E

He stated [...] "The only thing that I can say about it is Red Fred, Red Fred". He also said the future plans as of now are, they are going to go on The Parental Advisory Tour with 2 Live Crew, Onyx, Geto Boys and they were trying to also get Necro throughout the month of June leading up to the Gathering of the Juggalos. Then after the GOTJ, Shaggy 2 Dope will embark on the F.T.F.O.M.F. Tour to promote his third solo album F.T.F.O.M.F. While Shaggy 2 Dope is on tour Violent J is going to form the skeleton of the next Joker Card, and when Shaggy 2 Dope gets back from tour, then they will <b>start</b> <b>putting</b> the [...] "nerves, muscle, tissue, skin etc. together and then bring the entity to life". He also stated that ICP will also go on a 20th Anniversary: The Great Milenko Tour, after the Juggalo March On Washington (September 16 – 17, 2017) which will lead up to their 24th Annual Hallowicked Show, and then they will tour England mid to late November (13–20). In late April/early May Necro announced that he will not take part in the Juggalo March On Washington nor would he take part in The Parental Advisory Tour stating in part [...] "It's all good between us, just business. They were wanting me to tour for a month basically for free". On May 26, 2017 when F.T.F.O.M.F. was released, the song [...] "Foggin' Up The Window" [...] caught a lot of [...] "Juggalo Theorists" [...] attention because of Violent J's verse saying [...] "Now my number 4 is all red, Red Fred, Red Fred", believing that to be the name of the next Joker Card, or possibly it's what is said to [...] "summon" [...] the entity, going back to the April 13, 2017 edition of The Juggalo Show. [...] "Fearless Fred Fury" [...] was revealed as the name of the next Joker Card at their Hallowicked show.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Swedish magazine Bon, Robyn announced that she had plans to release three new albums in 2010. She said, [...] "I got all these great songs so why not? [...] It's been 5 years since Robyn and I didn't want to wait with a release until they are all recorded, so I decided to <b>start</b> <b>putting</b> them out right away." [...] Robyn told Popjustice journalist Peter Robinson, [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since I actually made a record! And I was thinking of how to shorten that time down and Eric, my manager, came up with the idea of what if I just start releasing songs, then I can tour them, then I can make some more songs. We started working like that. I think once it starts it will make more sense– you can just keep releasing stuff without the long breaks." [...] Robyn collaborated with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song [...] "Time Machine". Martin was responsible for producing Robyn's US breakthrough hits [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", which both charted inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996 and 1997. She said of the collaboration: [...] "It was nostalgic to go back into the studio together. For me, it’s perfect timing– I’ve come full circle. It’s a way for me to show that I’m not trying to distance myself from where I come from. It’s still all about the songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a solid 10–5 {{score in}} July, in the September 2011 tournament Kisenosato raced to an 8–0 start, before losing {{three in a}} row. However, he then rebounded by beating Hakuhō {{for the third time}} in their last five {{meetings}} on Day 12. He finished runner-up alongside Kotoshōgiku on 12–3, his first ever runner-up performance, and also shared the Outstanding Performance prize. With 22 wins in the last two tournaments, he was once again a candidate for promotion to ōzeki in November. However, with a record of 10–4 going into his match on the final day, he lost to Kotoshōgiku. This gave him a record of [...] "only" [...] 32 wins in three tournaments, below the Association's loosely defined ōzeki promotion standard of 33, but the Sumo Association had already indicated before the match took place that he had done enough to earn promotion. This was the second successive tournament to feature an ōzeki promotion, following Kotoshōgiku. Kisenosato credited his success to his late stablemaster, the former yokozuna Takanosato, who had died suddenly shortly before the tournament. [...] "Everything that he taught me about sumo led to this result and I'm so grateful." [...] He had long been regarded as one of the most promising Japanese sumo wrestlers, but prior to reaching ōzeki there had been concern expressed about his seeming inability to hold down a san'yaku position and a possible lack of fighting spirit. His stablemaster had also criticized him in 2010 for his attitude in training. Kisenosato's promotion was made official on 30 November, following a unanimous vote by the Sumo Association's executive board. Chairman Hanaregoma commented, [...] "He has been solid through the last several tournaments. I want him to <b>start</b> <b>putting</b> himself in title contention." ...|$|E
