40|$|Structural health {{monitoring}} (SHM) may {{be applied to}} bonded composite repairs to enable continuous through-life assessment of structural integrity. Adhesively bonded joints are an ideal starting point to develop real-time, in-situ monitoring due to knowledge of modes and locations of failure. Similarly, the ability to accurately monitor {{the health of a}} joint has potential to aid acceptance of adhesive bonding and move away from the contemporary &# 039;black aluminum&# 039; approach to design. Comparative Vacuum Monitoring (CVM) developed by Structural Monitoring Systems Pty Ltd (SMS) has potential for monitoring local &# 039;hot spots&# 039; such as joints. The CVM concept is simple, by creating a cavity on the surface or within a structure and drawing and holding a light vacuum, any damage breaching the cavity will cause a measurable leak. To monitor composite structures <b>sensor</b> <b>cavities</b> must extend from the interrogation system to potential locations of damage. For an adhesively bonded scarf repair, <b>sensors</b> <b>cavities</b> must reach or be integrated into the bondline itself. Consequently, it is vital to understand the influence of <b>sensor</b> <b>cavities</b> on structural performance of scarf repair joints. This paper focuses on the static and cyclic tensile performance of soft repairs (where the new material is co-cured in-situ) with internal <b>sensor</b> <b>cavities.</b> Microstructure changes such as fibre distortion and localised resin richness are characterised and discussed. The reduction of joint strength was found to be as much as 34 %. While overall fatigue performance was lowered, the sensitivity of the joint to accumulation of fatigue damage was reduced by the inclusion of galleries. Although this represents an important first step, considerable work remains for the implementation of a viable SHM system for scarf repairs or any form of adhesively bonded structure...|$|R

The new gas polarographic H 2 sensor shows a current level increment with concentration of the gaseous H 2 similar to those relating to metal ions in liquid electrolytes in well-known polarography. This phenomenon is caused by the fact that the diffusion of the gaseous H 2 through a gas diffusion hole built in the sensor is a rate-determining step in the gaseous-hydrogen sensing mechanism. The diffusion hole artificially limits the diffusion of the gaseous H 2 toward the electrode located at the <b>sensor</b> <b>cavity.</b> This gas polarographic H 2 sensor is actually an electrochemical-pumping cell since the gaseous H 2 is in fact pumped via the electrochemical driving force generated between the electrodes.

40|$|This {{research}} paper presents an experimental study into {{the effect of}} introducing long, narrow interlaminar galleries on the tensile and compressive properties of aerospace carbon/epoxy laminates. Galleries are thin and long holes used for the installation of small measuring devices, such as structural health monitoring (SHM) sensors. The galleries considered {{in this study are}} similar to those used in a novel SHM system known as comparative vacuum monitoring (CVM), developed for damage detection in aircraft structures. The effects of the shape, size and orientation of open-hole galleries on the in-plane tensile and compressive properties of a carbon/epoxy laminate were experimentally determined. The modulus and strength properties decrease with increasing gallery diameter (above a critical size) due to ply waviness around the galleries, reduced load-bearing area, and reduced fibre volume content caused by swelling. The mechanical properties of the laminate are generally higher when the galleries are aligned in the longitudinal (0 °) direction to the applied load compared to the transverse (90 °) direction. This is because a higher percentage of load-bearing plies are distorted by galleries in the transverse direction. An analytical model is presented for calculating the elastic modulus of laminates containing galleries. A simplified model is also presented for determining the strength of laminates with galleries aligned longitudinal to the load direction.

40|$|Airframe {{assemblers}} {{have long}} recognised {{that for a}} new aircraft to be successful it must use less fuel, have lower maintenance requirements, and be more affordable. One common tactic {{is the use of}} innovative materials, such as advanced composites. Composite materials are suited to structural connection by adhesive bonding, which minimises the need for inefficient mechanical fastening. The aim of this PhD project was to investigate the application of existing, yet immature Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques to adhesively bonded composite aerospace structures. The PhD study focused on two emerging SHM technologies - frequency response and comparative vacuum monitoring (CVM). This project aimed to provide missing critical information for each technique. This included determining sensitivity to damage, repeatability of results, and operating limitations for the frequency response method. Study of the CVM technique aimed to address effectiveness of damage detection, manufacture of sensor cavities, and the influence of sensor integration on mechanical performance of bonded structures. Experimental research work is presented examining the potential of frequency response techniques for the detection of debonding in composite-to-composite external patch repairs. Natural frequencies were found to decrease over a discrete frequency range as the debond size increased; confirming that such features could be used to both detect and characterise damage. The effectiveness of the frequency response technique was then confirmed for composite patch and scarf repair specimens for free-free and fixed-fixed boundary conditions. Finally, the viability of the frequency response technique was assessed for a scarf repair of a real aircraft component, where it was found that structural damping limited the maximum useable frequency. The feasibility of CVM technique for the inspection of co-cured stiffener-skin aircraft structures was explored. The creation of sensor cavities with tapered mandrels was found to significantly alter the microstructure of the stiffener, including crimping and waviness of fibres and resin-rich zones between plies. Representative stiffened-skin structure with two <b>sensor</b> <b>cavity</b> configurations (parallel and perpendicular to the stiffener direction) was tested to failure in tension and compression. While tensile failure strength was significantly reduced for both configurations (up to 25 %), no appreciable differences in compression properties were found. Two potential <b>sensor</b> <b>cavity</b> configurations were investigated for the extension of the CVM technique to pre-cured and co-bonded scarf repair schemes. The creation of radial and circumferential CVM sensor cavities was found to significantly alter the microstructure of the adhesive bond-line and the architecture of the repair material {{in the case of the}} co-bonded repair. These alterations changed the failure mode and reduced the tensile failure strength of the repair. A fibre straightening mechanism responsible for progressive failure (specific to co-bonded repairs with circumferential cavities) was identified, and subsequently supported with acoustic emission testing and numerical analysis. While fatigue performance was generally reduced by the presence of CVM cavities, the circumferential cavities appeared to retard crack progression, reducing sensitivity to the accumulation of fatigue damage. These outcomes have brought forward the implementation of SHM in bonded composite structures, which has great potential to improve the operating efficiency of next generation aircraft...|$|E
40|$|Multiphase flow {{measurement}} {{is important in}} chemical processing, water treatment and oil & gas industry. The multiphase flow sensor proposed in this research utilizes the resonant frequencies that occur inside a cavity and {{the differences in the}} permittivity of the measures phases. By measuring this response over the range of discrete frequencies the sample can be characterised. Polar material like water has relatively high permittivity (ε_r= 81), while non-polar material such as oil and gas have low permittivity value (ε_r= 2. 2 - 2. 5) and (ε_r= 1) respectively. Hence, a small change in the water fraction may result in a comparatively large frequency shift. In this research, the electromagnetic cylindrical cavity sensor system successfully demonstrated its capability to analyze various fractions of water-gas mixture. The results were consistent in the case of both the static and dynamic flow. The statistical analysis of the captured data showed a linear relationship of the amplitude data with the change in the water fractions. It was also found that the technique was independent of the temperature change. The system was able to successfully detect the stratified, wavy, elongated bubbles and homogeneous flow regimes. The electromagnetic rectangular cavity sensor system is introduced to pick up the tiny shifts in the permittivity when the low permittivity material is used or temperature changes. The microwave sensor system is able to detect water-air fraction, water-oil fraction, oil-air fraction and water temperature. The novel solution of the combination of both cylindrical and rectangular sensor system demonstrates the ability to detect both high and low permittivity changes. These dual-cavity <b>sensor</b> <b>cavity</b> systems have been able to detect water level, flow regime and temperature in the pipe.

A sensor system consists of a number of core components, including the sensing element, interrogation/demodulation, multiplexing, signal processing and hardware equipment. In the process of development, a number of issues have been identified and investigated, which resulted in the improvement of the system performance, as well as the proposal of new techniques for the sensor system. First, an improved demodulation technique for a type of sensor, namely the fibre Fizeau interferometer (FFI), is presented. The technique is based on the improvement of the Fourier transform peak detection method, which suffers severely from the poor resolution and accuracy of finding the <b>sensor</b> <b>cavity</b> length. The improvement over the original method has been compared and verified through simulations and experiments. Second, a simultaneous demodulation technique for multiplexed FFI and fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is proposed.

In this paper we {{assess the impact}} of these new materials on atomic frequency standards. As an example, an active hydrogen maser could use Josephson junctions and infinite conductivity to sense and shield magnetic fields to high precision while enabling a significant reduction in size and mass. Similar benefits are found in the use of a small, heavily loaded superconducting cavity for the maser. High temperature superconductors will also have ramifications for other frequency standards, and for technologies related to frequency sources such as distribution networks. High temperature superconductivity is discussed from a technologists point of view, with particular emphasis on the temperature dependence of various properties of su-perconducting shields, <b>sensors,</b> <b>cavities,</b> e t ~.

Light weight and small size can result from effective shields and also from application of small persistent mode electromagnets in (e. g.) ion pumps.

40|$|In {{stamping}} operations, {{sheet metal}} is formed into a desired shape by pressing it in a hydraulic or mechanical press between suitably shaped dies. As a predominant manufacturing process, {{sheet metal forming}} has been widely used {{for the production of}} automobiles, aircraft, home appliances, beverage cans and many other industrial and commercial products. A major effort till date on stamping processes monitoring has been focused on investigating variations in the press force. Given that the press force itself is an integral of the contact pressure distribution over the die and binder contact interfaces, it is conceivable that defects may be better identified by analyzing the contact pressure distribution directly at the tooling-workpiece interface, instead of measuring the press force, which is less reflective of the localized forming process due to its nature as a secondary effect. It is thus desirable that a new, integrated sensing method capable of directly assimilating forming pressure distribution in the tooling structure be devised for improved stamping process monitoring. Designing such a distributed sensing scheme and analyzing the feasibility of its structural integration into a stamping tooling structure is the objective of this reported work. In this context, four research tasks have been identified and examined {{during the course of this}} work: 1) Devising a New, Embedded Sensing Method The new sensing method monitors stamping processes by means of an array of force sensors structurally integrated into the stamping tooling. The ability to directly measure local forming events by means of such an integrated and distributed sensing provides a new means of performing defect detection and process monitoring. Such a distributed sensing system overcomes the limitations of traditional tonnage and acceleration sensing systems which are focused on the measurement of indirect, global parameters. The new method is based on the evaluation of spatially continuous pressure surfaces from spatially discrete sensor measurements that are directly related to the local events at the stamping interface. To evaluate the effectiveness of this method, a panel stamping test bed equipped with an array of embedded force sensors has been designed, modeled and fabricated. Data obtained from experiments conducted on the test bed indicates that the new sensing method can be highly effective in process monitoring of stamping operations. 2) Reconstruction of Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Contact Pressure Structurally integrating sensors under tooling surfaces reduces the surface rigidity of the tool, thus limiting the number of sensors and the locations at which they can be embedded. This in turn affects the reconstruction of contact pressure distribution on the tooling surface. Numeric surface generation methods, such as Bezier surfaces and Thin Plate Spline surfaces offer a method for estimating the contact pressure distributions on the tooling surfaces from a sparse distribution of sensors. The concept of interpolating force distributions using surfaces has been investigated by researchers previously. However, selection of the surface generation method has remained largely an ad hoc process. The work presented here addresses this issue by using tooling interface contact pressure distribution information obtained from FE simulations as the basis for evaluating the accuracy of two commonly employed surface methods mentioned above. In order to reach a generic conclusion, the mathematical background of these schemes has been examined in light of the purpose at hand. The results indicate that an interpolative scheme such as the Thin Plate Spline surfaces (TPS), which can estimate the contact pressure distributions more accurately in a multi-sensor environment. The local and global accuracies of the Thin Plate Spline surface modeling technique have been experimentally evaluated using a sensor embedded stamping test bed designed for the purpose. 3) Modeling of Contact Pressure Distribution at the Sheet Metal-Tooling Interface Information about the contact pressure distribution at the tooling interface is critical to identifying the accuracy of numeric schemes that estimate by interpolation or approximation the contact pressure at any point on the tooling surface, based on a limited number of spatially distributed sensors. Furthermore, such knowledge is valuable in identifying operational parameters for the sensors to be integrated into the stamping tooling structure. In the absence of a tractable analytic method of determining the contact pressure distribution on stamping tooling surfaces, Finite Element models of a stamping operation have been created. Furthermore the drilling of sensor cavities under the working surfaces of the dies adversely affects the working life of stamping dies and their strength. The accuracy of analytic fatigue failure mechanics in evaluating the effect of parameters, such as embedding depth and sensor rigidity, on the operational life of the die, suffers from uncertainty in the estimation of stress concentrations around sharp geometric features of the <b>sensor</b> <b>cavity.</b> This shortcoming has been circumvented by the creation of FE models of the <b>sensor</b> <b>cavity</b> for more accurate estimation of stress concentrations around sharp geometries. The effect of different embedding materials on the sensitivity of embedded sensors has also been evaluated based on these models. 4) Defect Detection in Stamping Operation The ultimate goal of this thesis research was to study the feasibility of identifying defects in a stamping process based on the contact pressure distribution surfaces. This was achieved in this reported work by spatio-temporal decomposition of ‘parameters’ derived from the contact pressure distribution surfaces. Here ‘parameters’ refers to quantities such as the minimum, maximum, and mean contact pressures. These parameters have a time-varying spatial location as well as magnitude value associated with them. The feasibility of defect detection in stamping operations based on such parameters has been investigated. In addition to these focal areas, the design and implementation of a stamping test bed equipped for distributed contact pressure sensing has also been researched. This test bed was utilized for experimental verification of the developed theories and numerical models. Design of the proposed test bed required research into additional topics like the design of a protective package for embedded sensors and the effect of sensor embedding depth on contact pressure measurements. These issues have been addressed in this work, culminating in the experimental demonstration of the embedded pressure sensing system for process monitoring in the sheet metal stamping processes...|$|E
40|$|Cavity ring-down is {{investigated}} as {{a technique}} to increase the sensitivity of optical fibre gas <b>sensors.</b> The ring-down <b>cavity</b> consists of an optical fibre loop containing a micro-optic gas cell and an erbium-doped optical fibre amplifier. The erbium fibre amplifier introduces gain into the cavity to increase the ring-down times and therefore the system sensitivity. This paper reports {{an investigation of the}} system sensitivit...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{a new type of}} <b>cavity</b> <b>sensor</b> {{geometry}} used in the most recent of a series of solar flux pyrheliometers, known as the active cavity radiometer (ACR). The new Type V sensor design incorporates a modification of its predecessor, the ACR IV sensor. This modification decreases the uncertainty within which cavity absorptance can be predicted by more than a factor of 10...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} different masking parameters onto the surface quality of the { 111 } sidewalls in order to generate specifically deep cavities by wet-anisotropic-etching of bulk silicon, for optical <b>sensors</b> using <b>cavity</b> sidewalls as reflectors. Mask alignment with crystal planes prior to wet-etching {{is found to be}} essential {{in order to avoid the}} appearance of additional planes during long etching. Mask deposition processes have been also evaluated. Among the different employed mask materials, Cr/Au gives the best results. It is then shown that cavities as deep as 1 mm with low roughness sidewalls can be simply produced with potassium hydroxide solution with periodic piranha cleanin...|$|R
30|$|The glass {{substrate}} cavity area is 6.37 [*]×[*] 6.37  mm 2, and the cavity depth is 30  μm. The anodically bonded area of sample 1 is 2.8  mm 2, and {{the areas of}} samples 2, 3, and 4 are 3.1  mm 2, 3.5  mm 2, and 8.6  mm 2, respectively. All samples have an internal structure for the MEMS <b>sensor</b> in the <b>cavity</b> (see Fig.  2). Sample 1 with a BAR of 7.0 % has only the internal structures for the MEMS <b>sensor</b> in the <b>cavity,</b> these are also used to support the sealed cavity. Glass pillars with a diameter of 20  μm are arranged in the cavity at 320  μm-intervals in sample 2, with a BAR of 7.6 %. A glass pillar array with a pitch of about 1.2  mm is arranged to support the cavity space in sample 3, with a BAR of 8.5 %. For sample 4, glass pillars with a radius of 15  μm are arranged at intervals of 60  μm, with a BAR of 21.2 %.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe study a {{resonant}} interferometric <b>sensor</b> {{with two}} <b>cavity</b> eigenstates. The finesse associated to one eigenstate is {{significantly lower than}} the empty cavity value, {{because of the presence of}} a lossy intracavity sample. We show theoretically that the sensitivity of the interferometer only depends on the empty cavity finesse when the low-finesse eigenfrequency is locked to resonance. This is experimentally demonstrated and a resolution of 60 pm is reported. Our method can be applied to any resonant two-beam interferometer...|$|R
