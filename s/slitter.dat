50|$|Noodles from instant ramen {{noodle soup}} are {{continuous}} viscoelastic gluten matrix evenly mixed with starch granules, salt, gums, and other additives and preservatives. There are three key ingredients {{in making the}} noodle dough, which are wheat flour, water and salt. After mixing, kneading, compounding, and rolling, a continuous viscous noodle dough sheet is made and cut by roll <b>slitters.</b> The conveying belt which transports noodle dough sheet moves slower than the rotation speed of blades on the slitters; therefore, noodle dough sheet could be pressed multiple times {{up and down and}} produce the unique wavy form of instant noodles. After slitting, noodle dough sheets undergo steaming and frying, which triggers starch gelatinization to increase the water retention during cooking in boiling water to shorten the cooking time of instant noodles.|$|R
50|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was {{dedicated}} and McLouth Steel became {{able to produce}} iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton basic oxygen furnace (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in North America to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton electric arc furnaces. The reversing Steckel mill {{was replaced by a}} six stand continuous 60 in hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to compliment the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were also added along with the <b>slitters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{invention}} of the rolling mill in Europe {{may be attributed to}} Leonardo da Vinci in his drawings. The earliest rolling mills in crude form but the same basic principles were found in Middle East and South Asia as early as 600 BCE. Earliest rolling mills were slitting mills, which were introduced from what is now Belgium to England in 1590. These passed flat bars between rolls to form a plate of iron, which was then passed between grooved rolls (<b>slitters)</b> to produce rods of iron. The first experiments at rolling iron for tinplate took place about 1670. In 1697, Major John Hanbury erected a mill at Pontypool to roll 'Pontypool plates'—blackplate. Later this began to be rerolled and tinned to make tinplate. The earlier production of plate iron in Europe had been in forges, not rolling mills.|$|R

40|$|Some paper-mill rewinders use infra-red {{carbon dioxide}} laser heads to slit the web into rolls of given widths. However, despite certain advantages, laser <b>slitters</b> are not widely used {{mainly because of}} {{installation}} and operation costs. Web breaks on a printing press cause both time and paper waste. Breakings occur because of defects in {{the edges of the}} web, such as notches or extra fibers, which offer less resitance to the high tensions existing during the printing of a web at high speed. Since paper edges are much cleaner when cut with an infra-red carbon dioxide laser than when cut with knives, it is possible that laser-cut edges might be stronger and thus reduce the number of breakings of the web. In order to test this hypothesis, tensile tests were carried out on laser-cut and shear-cut strips for three different types of papers (coated and uncoated stock, and newsprint) and results were compared. Since direct observation of the effect of a laser beam on cellulose fibers might help in explaining differences in behavior between the two types of paper samples, a scanning electron microscope was used to take photographs of paper areas following treatment with a CO 2 laser functioning in pulsed mode. The photographs revealed a drastic change in the structure of hit cellulose: the latter looks melted. This 2 ̆ 2 melted 2 ̆ 2 portion of a laser-cut paper edge is extremely thin (several micrometers) and seems to slow down the combustion of adjacent fibers. Regarding tensile tests results, laser-cut strips are always stronger, but the relative difference between the two types of specimens is very low (less than 1...|$|R
50|$|Even though dry instant noodles {{might not}} show {{any sign of}} elasticity, cooked instant noodles {{generally}} have higher elasticity than other types of noodles when they are cooked, and the unique wavy form also differentiates instant noodles from other common noodles like udon or flat noodles. The wavy form of instant noodles sometimes creates random spirals after noodles are cooked, which can give a unique springiness to the noodle strands. The wavy form of instant noodles is formed when noodle dough sheets are being cut by rotation <b>slitters.</b> As mentioned above, due {{to the difference between}} the velocity of conveying belt and blade rotation, noodle dough sheets could be pressed by blades multiple times within a certain area, and that creates the unique wavy form of instant noodles. During pressing by heavy blades, the continuous gluten structure is ruptured at certain points and does not return to its original shape, but the remaining gluten structures are strong enough to keep it hanging; therefore, wavy noodle strands are formed and maintained during processing. Other than the physical springiness, the selection of ingredients also ensures the high elasticity of instant noodles. Instant noodles require wheat flour with high protein content to ensure noodle strands are be broken during processing, which will make a more viscoelastic noodle dough and result in more elastic noodles. Furthermore, potato starch is a key ingredient in instant noodles, which has characteristics of low gelatinization temperature, high viscosity, and rapid swelling. Therefore, the addition of starch could also increase the elasticity of noodles. High salt content in instant noodles also increase the elasticity of noodle strands. Salt, dissolved in water as ions, could strengthen the interaction between gluten structures which can also increase the elasticity of noodles.|$|R

5000|$|Roll {{slitting}} is {{a shearing}} operation that cuts a large roll of material into narrower rolls. There {{are two types}} of slitting: log slitting and rewind slitting. In log slitting the roll of material is treated as a whole (the 'log') and one or more slices are taken from it without an unrolling/re-reeling process. In rewind slitting the web is unwound and run through the machine, passing through knives or lasers, before being rewound on one or more shafts to form narrower rolls. The multiple narrower strips of material may be known as mults (short for multiple) or pancakes if their diameter is much more than their width. For rewind slitting the machine used is called a <b>slitter</b> rewinder, a <b>slitter</b> or a slitting machine - these names are used interchangeably for the same machines. [...] For particularly narrow & thin products the pancakes become unstable, and then the rewind may be onto a bobbin-wound reel: the rewind bobbins are much wider than the slit width and the web oscillates across the reel as it is rewound. Apart from the stability benefit it is also then possible to put very long lengths, (frequently many tens of kilometres), onto one bobbin.|$|E
