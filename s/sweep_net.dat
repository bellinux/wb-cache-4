Data collected using <b>sweep</b> <b>netting</b> and pitfall traps showed {{that the effect of}} diversion of the river flow was site-specific, affecting particularly the spray habitat. Rarefaction analysis of both <b>sweep</b> <b>netting</b> and pitfall samples indicated that the expected richness of Coleoptera declined significantly in all habitats after commissioning of the power plant. <b>Sweep</b> <b>netting</b> and pitfall samples showed that the highest Shannon-Wiener diversity index value before the diversion of the river flow was in the spray zone, but the index value decreased after diversion. Changes in the other two habitats were less prominent. Analysis of variance using diversity index values from five pitfall samples in each habitat type before and after commissioning indicated that there were no statistically significant differences in the diversity index between the two sampling periods or among the three habitat types. Renkonen's similarity index between habitats showed that pitfall samples had higher similarity (87 %) than did samples from <b>sweep</b> <b>netting</b> (69 %). It is suggested that for mitigation purposes, artificial spray systems, which have been installed in other wetlands of the Kihansi Gorge, also be installed to cover the whole Lower Wetland in which this study was undertaken. In order to maintain overall biodiversity in the Kihansi Gorge, it is suggested that the ecosystem conservation approach be prioritised...|$|R

40|$|New {{knowledge}} about the responses of species to fire is needed to plan for biodiversity conservation {{in the face of}} changing fire regimes. However, the knowledge that is acquired may be influenced by the sampling method and the taxonomic resolution of a study. To investigate these potential sampling biases, we examined invertebrate responses to time since fire in mallee woodlands of southern Australia. Using a large-scale replicated study system, we sampled over 60000 invertebrates with large pitfall traps, wet pitfall traps and <b>sweep</b> <b>nets,</b> and undertook analyses at morphospecies and order level. Large pitfalls and <b>sweep</b> <b>nets</b> detected several strong fire effects, whereas wet pitfall traps detected few effects. Invertebrate abundance in <b>sweep</b> <b>nets</b> was highest shortly after fire because of grasshopper outbreaks. Several additional morphospecies showed strong preferences for different stages in the post-fire succession. In contrast with morphospecies effects, analyses at order level either failed to detect fire effects or were driven by the most abundant species. For fire research to produce credible results with the potential to guide management, it must use a range of sampling techniques and undertake analyses at (morpho) species level. Homogeneous fire management, such as fire suppression in fragmented landscapes or widespread frequent burning for asset protection, is likely to cause declines in fire-affected invertebrates...|$|R

50|$|Specimens were {{collected}} in Costa Rica by Noyes using a heavy triangular <b>sweep</b> <b>net</b> fitted with a galvanized metal screen with 4 mm mesh over the opening. Sweeping was done by gently dragging the net through vegetation and dumping the net contents at five-minute intervals into 80% ethanol in a sturdy polythene bag to reduce damage to insects in the debris. Sweeping was done for two hours periods (barring rain) so different samples could be compared, if necessary. The samples were sorted later in a laboratory using a method that ensured all the smallest Hymenoptera were found.|$|E
5000|$|Insects are passively caught using funnels, pitfall traps, bottle traps, malaise traps, flight {{interception}} {{traps and}} other passive types of insect traps, {{some of which}} are baited with small bits of sweet foods (such as honey). Different designs of ultraviolet light traps such as the Robinson trap are also used by entomologists for collecting nocturnal insects (especially moths) during faunistic survey studies. Aspirators or [...] "pooters" [...] suck up insects too small or delicate to handle with fingers.Several different types of nets are commonly used to actively collect insects. Aerial insect nets are used to collect flying insects. The bag of a butterfly net is generally constructed from a lightweight mesh to minimize damage to delicate butterfly wings. A <b>sweep</b> <b>net</b> is used to collect insects from grass and brush. It is similar to a butterfly net, except that the bag is generally constructed from more rugged material.The <b>sweep</b> <b>net</b> is swept back and forth through vegetation quickly turning the opening from side to side and following a shallow figure eight pattern. The collector walks forward while sweeping, and the net is moved through plants and grasses with force.This requires a heavy net fabric such as sailcloth to prevent tearing, although light nets can be used if swept less vigorously. Sweeping continues for some distance and then the net is flipped over, with the bag hanging over the rim, trapping the insects until they can be removed with a pooter. Other types of nets used for collecting insects include beating nets and aquatic nets. Leaf litter sieves are used by coleopterists and to collect larvae.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the potential causes of changes to bird communities in exurban areas, {{we examined the}} relationship between bird and macroinvertebrate communities in exurbanized forest. We randomly located sampling points across a gradient of exurbanization. We used point counts to quantify bird communities and <b>sweep</b> <b>netting,</b> soil cores, pitfalls, and frass collectors to quantify macroinvertebrates. Bird communities had higher richness and abundance in exurban areas compared to undeveloped forests, and lost some species of conservation concern but gained others. The macroinvertebrate community was slightly more abundant in exurban areas, with a slight shift in taxonomic composition. The abundance of macroinvertebrates in soil cores (but not pitfalls) predicted the abundance of ground-foraging birds. The abundance of macroinvertebrates in <b>sweep</b> <b>nets</b> was not associated with the abundance of aerial insectivore birds. Exurbanization therefore appears to change bird and macroinvertebrate communities, but to a lesser extent than agricultural forest fragmentation or intensive urbanization...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this program of study is to explore the relationship between invasive plants and arthropods {{and the importance of}} arthropods as bioindicators of environmental change. This thesis provides a systematic review of the literature on arthropod communities in association with invasive plants, then quantifies these effects with a case-study involving the plant invader Centaurea stoebe, and finally contrasts two arthropod sampling methods, <b>sweep</b> <b>netting</b> and pan trapping in a grassland system. The majority of arthropod-invasive plant literature is relatively simple, documenting the herbivore feeding guild in only the invaded region, as opposed to 2 or more trophic levels in both the invaded and native region. In grassland systems invaded by C. stoebe, overall arthropod abundance was reduced compared to uninvaded areas, though different trophic groups responded differently to invasion: native herbivores and omnivores negatively, and predators, detritivores, and biological control herbivores positively, likely through both direct and indirect mechanisms. For community-scale arthropod surveys in impacted grassland systems, a combination of <b>sweep</b> <b>netting</b> and pan trapping is recommended to adequately capture most arthropod groups, however, bees, which are important bioindicator organisms, are well represented in pan trap captures alone. Future studies of invasive plants would benefit from multi-trophic arthropod surveys to elucidate broad-scale patterns before finer resolution, taxon specific studies occur. Arthropods are key ecosystem components and quickly mirror the effects of environmental disturbance, making them valuable bioindicators...|$|R
