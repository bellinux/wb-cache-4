5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils {{of the world in}} the box, she placed her power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E
25|$|In Coffee {{a picture}} of utter destitution is drawn. Like the story A Little Blade of Grass this story also deals with master-servant relations, but the elderly woman who {{is the focus of}} this story doesn't live in the master's house and consume his food. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> defer to the wealth and status of the wealthy neighbors that {{surround}} her and cater to their every need, but it does her little good in the end.|$|E
25|$|As {{the story}} {{continues}} {{from the previous}} episode, Emma sees the woman across from her in the cell as the same woman who was arrested for helping Snow, and learns that they are both due to be executed immediately the next day. Using her tricks from the night Neal broke into the amusement park, Emma remembers <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> break a lock by using two spoons, and it works. Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows up to say that another woman (Emma) has his ring. Charming looks at Snow's fairy dust pendant while she tells him her backstory (another timeline that was thrown off), and {{comes up with a}} plan to break into Regina’s castle first, then rescue Emma and steal back the ring. Snow tells them to wait, which gives Hook and Charming time to talk about love. Moments later, Red Riding Hood shows up, revealing herself as a friend of Snow's, and who can get them into the castle. As they reach the place, Red, who transformed into a wolf, scares a guard into running away, but the escape plan goes awry when they run into Emma and her fellow inmate, prompting Hook to tell Emma that she deprived him of a dashing rescue. Seconds later, Snow and Regina prepare to face off, with Snow throwing her dark fairy dust, but Regina uses her magic to stop it in midair. Snow tries telling her that what happened to Daniel (when she told Cora) was a mistake, saying that she was only a child, but an unforgiving Regina talks about consequences and sets up a stake to burn her. Regina throws a fireball at the helpless Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E

It's just the energy, I think. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> really make a party a party. That's what I want – to make this record to be the {{ultimate}} party record. That's pretty much how that all came about. ... I guess each time we work together, we give 100% of our energy to each other. It's crazy. Sometimes you can't explain what the chemistry is.

500|$|During an interview, {{executive}} producer Susan Bower explained that Natasha is [...] "a teenage troublemaker who is actually really, really clever". Natasha {{wants to be}} a famous model, she loves to gossip and <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get the boy's attentions. Bower also added that Natasha and Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) clash because Summer is a feminist who fights for causes, while Natasha is the opposite. Novakovic is fond of the love-hate relationship Natasha shares with Summer and said that they were [...] "frenemies." [...] She further explained, [...] "They're in the same social group at school, {{and despite the fact that}} they have so many differences, they're similar in a lot of ways. And Summer is Natasha's only female friend, don't forget." ...|$|E
500|$|Series co-creator and {{executive}} producer Weiss praised Clarke's portrayal in the scene saying [...] "Emilia absolutely crushed it. It's one of those weird scenes because it was half shot in Spain, half in Belfast. But largely due to her performance, it works brilliantly." [...] Sackheim, {{the director of the}} episode, noted in an interview, [...] "With the interior, {{there was only one way}} for her to play it, which is, bemused. She's the keeper of the secret. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> extricate herself from this. I thought the ease with which she delivered the lines was necessary for the audience to feel jeopardy for her and for them to think she was crazy. The sequence outside was all about claiming the throne — or reclaiming the throne." [...] Sackheim also stated, [...] "We wanted to clearly distinguish everything we've seen from the end of the last season and the beginning of this one." ...|$|E
5000|$|She was [...] "the first self-made female millionaire, an {{accomplishment}} she owed primarily <b>to</b> publicity savvy. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> advertise—using 'fear copy {{with a bit}} of blah-blah'— and introduced the concept of 'problem' skin types. She also pioneered the use of pseudo-science in marketing, donning a lab coat in many advertisements, despite the fact that her only training had been a two-month tour of European skin-care facilities. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> manipulate consumers' status anxiety, as well: If a product faltered initially, she would hike the price to raise the perceived value." ...|$|R

500|$|Abi {{has been}} {{described}} by the official EastEnders website as the family's [...] "golden girl" [...] compared to Lauren, hinting that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get her own way. She {{has been described}} as [...] "bubbly" [...] and [...] "self-assured" [...] with a nose for mischief. She has also been described as having the biggest heart in Walford, bringing out the best in the people around her. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror said that Abi is a [...] "real soft touch". Jon Wise from The People said that after Abi received a makeover in 2010, she [...] "actually turned out to be quite pretty". In 2012, Fitzgerald told Inside Soap Laura-Jane Tyler that Abi has grown up in her first six years on screen, and is now sensible, [...] "like a [...] " [...] and has had to mature quickly because of the dramatic situations she has been involved in. Tyler added that Abi is the most level-headed and sensible member of the Branning family and [...] "puts her [...] to shame with her mature approach to [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|When Carter goes {{undercover}} in the episode, {{she wears}} a dress inspired by the evening dresses of the 1930s and 40s, which the script described as a [...] "Veronica Lake look". Ottobre-Melton noted that [...] "We got to make Peggy into the classic femme fatale". For the character of Colleen O'Brien, series costume designer Giovanna Ottobre-Melton saw her as [...] "a hard working girl making just enough to get by. The war term 'Mend and Make Do' really applies to her. She has a few nice pieces in her closet that she scrimped and saved to buy. My guess is <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> unravel an old tired sweater to knit herself a new one." [...] The man in the green suit [...] "wore a suit that was a tricky balance," [...] explained Ottobre-Melton. [...] "The goal {{was to find a}} green that wasn't over the top, but still made a powerful statement. The suit I designed was inspired by a 1940s green double breasted suit I had located." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics have}} called The Good Terrorists title an oxymoron. Robert Boschman {{suggested}} it {{is indicative of}} Alice's [...] "contradictory personality" [...] – she renovates the squat's house, yet is bent on destroying society. In The Hudson Review, George Kearns wrote that the title [...] "hovers above the novel with... irony". The reader assumes that Alice is the [...] "good terrorist", but that while {{she may be a}} good person, she is [...] "rotten at being a terrorist". Writing in World Literature Today, Mona Knapp concluded that Lessing's heroine, the [...] "good terrorist", is neither a good person, nor a good revolutionary. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> renovate houses and manipulate people to her advantage, but she is unemployed and steals money from her parents. When real revolutionaries start using the squat to ship arms, she panics and, going behind her comrades' backs, makes a telephone call to the authorities to warn them. Knapp called Alice [...] "a bad terrorist and a stunted human being". Fishburn suggested that it is Lessing herself who is the [...] "good terrorist", symbolised here by Alice, but that hers is [...] "political terrorism of a literary kind", where she frequently disguises her ideas in [...] "very domestic-looking fiction", and [...] "direct challenge... our sense of reality".|$|E

500|$|Amy Phillips of Pitchfork Media commended Gaga's {{performance}} {{saying that}} it was [...] "amazing as usual– a master class in over-the-top theatrics, campy gender-bending, and cheeky fun... But it was almost beside the point. The whole Gaga machine, the whole Gaga world we were immersed in– that was the point. It was overwhelming, all consuming. Something even the best album promo cycles only dream of being." [...] Phillips wondered how Gaga would be able to [...] "top" [...] the ArtRave event and listed it as an unprecedented promotional tool for an artist's album release cycle. Billboard Andrew Hampp and Jason Lipshutz compared Gaga's outfit to a [...] "bizarro" [...] version of Jack Box, the mascot for Jack in the Box, and wrote that the lip-synched portion of her performance was [...] "more pop art than artistic pop music." [...] Hampp and Lipshutz summarized their experience by writing, [...] "Even if the 'ARTPOP' live show still needs a bit of tinkering to fully captivate, Lady Gaga showed on Sunday night that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> meld low art and high art at a party." [...] Michael Baggs of Gigwise described the concert as [...] "sparse but impressive" [...] and wrote that Gaga appeared [...] "wide-eyed and slightly manic... but impressed with live vocals and a hugely energetic performance." ...|$|E
500|$|The song mainly {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, with some noting it as a standout on the album. Don Shewey of Rolling Stone commented [...] "Although it's awfully {{reminiscent of the}} Pointer Sisters' 'He's So Shy', 'How Will I Know' is still irresistibly danceable." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote [...] "...what really impresses some 20-plus years on are the lighter tracks, particularly the breakthrough single 'How Will I Know'." [...] While listing Houston's top five songs of the 1980s, Steve Peake of About.com gave the song a positive review, writing, [...] "Houston's boppy, peppy numbers tend to suffer from a particularly dated sound compared to her ballads, but this song still works remarkably well because of its lush melody throughout the verse, bridge and chorus." [...] "his track helps Houston prove that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> interpret, with great skill, tunes that display solid craftsmanship," [...] he added. While reviewing the Deluxe Anniversary Edition of the album, Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly commented on the a cappella version of the song noting, [...] "a cappella mix of 'How Will I Know' [...] displays the singer's precision long {{before the advent of}} Auto-Tune." [...] While reviewing The Ultimate Collection, Nick Levine of Digital Spy added, [...] "Houston's floor-fillers have aged a little more gracefully, although their clunky, thudding drum sounds are as unmistakably eighties as Joan Collins' Dynasty wardrobe." [...] The song was voted number twelve in VH1's List of Greatest Songs of the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|... "What'd I Say" [...] {{was banned}} by many {{black and white}} radio {{stations}} because of, as one critic noted, [...] "the dialogue between himself and his backing singers that started in church {{and ended up in}} the bedroom". The erotic nature was obvious to listeners, but a deeper aspect of the fusion between black gospel music and R troubled many black audiences. Music, as was much of American society, was also segregated, and some critics complained that gospel was not only being appropriated by secular musicians, but it was being marketed to white listeners. During several concerts in the 1960s, the crowds became so frenetic and the shows so resembled revival meetings while Charles performed [...] "What'd I Say" [...] that the police were called in, when the organizers became worried that riots might break out. The moral controversy surrounding the song has been attributed to its popularity; Charles later acknowledged in an interview that the beat was catchy, but it was the suggestive lyrics that attracted listeners: [...] "'See the girl with the diamond ring. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> shake that thing.' It wasn't the diamond ring that got 'em." [...] "What'd I Say" [...] was Ray Charles' first crossover hit into the growing genre of rock and roll. He seized the opportunity of his immense newfound success and announced to Ertegun and Wexler that he was considering signing with ABC-Paramount Records (later renamed ABC Records) later in 1959. While he was in negotiations with ABC-Paramount, Atlantic Records released an album of his hits, titled What'd I Say.|$|E

500|$|Unlike Angie, Den's first wife, Chrissie [...] "has {{a strong}} will and fights {{for what she}} wants". However, as Oberman noted, [...] "there is enough of Angie in Chrissie to see that Den likes {{a certain type of}} strong woman. Chrissie is Angie with 15 years of {{feminism}} behind her", explaining in an interview with Radio 4: [...] "I like to think of Chrissie as Angie with benefits... She's his [...] equal a bit more than Angie was." [...] Oberman later expanded: [...] "Chrissie, unlike Angie, won't hit the bottle as soon as Den starts playing away. She's proved she's ready to sit and wait for her revenge. She's a great, strong character". Talking to the Daily Mirror shortly after appearing on-screen {{for the first time in}} April, Oberman declared, [...] "Chrissie is the sort of woman I'd really like to be friends with... She's an Essex girl who was brought up in a family of brothers, so <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> work men. She understands that what they say is not always what they mean." [...] In her official character profile, Chrissie is portrayed as someone [...] "happy to play mind games" [...] and [...] "often two steps ahead of her husband", being described as [...] "the type of person to be your best friend. But if you cross her, she'll get her own back in the end." [...] Her strong-willed persona has led reviewers to label the character as [...] "venomous", [...] "sinister" [...] "devious", and [...] "hard as nails" [...] in [...] "the grand tradition of landladies of the Queen Vic", manipulating others to ensure matters go her way. As the [...] "scheming" [...] figure of the show, she was described as a [...] "witch" [...] and [...] "super-bitch", but was also represented as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "clever" [...] woman. Executive producer Kate Harwood characterised Chrissie as a survivor, someone who [...] "thinks on her feet" [...] whatever the situation. Oberman has stated that she was thrilled to be [...] "playing such a strong female character", whom she described as not a bad person at heart but one willing to stand and [...] "fight in her corner".|$|E

2500|$|Anything Goes {{proved to}} be the first of five Cole Porter musicals in which Merman starred. In {{addition}} to the title song, the score included [...] "I Get a Kick Out of You", [...] "You're the Top", and [...] "Blow Gabriel Blow". It opened on November 21, 1934, at the Alvin Theatre, and the New York Post called Merman [...] "vivacious and ingratiating in her comedy moments, and the embodiment of poise and technical adroitness" [...] when singing [...] "as only <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Although Merman always had remained with a show until the end of its run, she left Anything Goes after eight months to appear with Eddie Cantor in the film Strike Me Pink. She was replaced by Benay Venuta, with whom she enjoyed a long but frequently tempestuous friendship.|$|E
