5|$|<b>Self-awareness</b> {{appears to}} be a sign of {{abstract}} thinking. <b>Self-awareness,</b> although not well-defined, is believed to be a precursor to more advanced processes such as metacognitive reasoning. The traditional method for measuring this is the mirror test, which determines if an animal possesses the ability of self-recognition. Mammals that have 'passed' the mirror test include Asian elephants (some pass, some do not); chimpanzees; bonobos; orangutans; humans, from 18 months (mirror stage); bottlenose dolphins killer whales; and false killer whales.|$|E
5|$|Alex is a {{young man}} who is {{depressed}} after his fiancée breaks up with him. Tired of seeing him unhappy, Alex's grandmother sends him Ada, a Tanaka X-5 android which is capable of intelligent human interaction. The robot is initially incapable of <b>self-awareness,</b> as each android has a program that blocks any potential free thought or consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals are intelligent, {{with some}} {{possessing}} large brains, <b>self-awareness</b> and tool use. Mammals can communicate and vocalize {{in several different}} ways, including the production of ultrasound, scent-marking, alarm signals, singing, and echolocation. Mammals can organize themselves into fission-fusion societies, harems, and hierarchies, but can also be solitary and territorial. Most mammals are polygynous, but some can be monogamous or polyandrous.|$|E
5|$|Wong {{stated that}} most people take for granted what they possess, and may be without {{identity}} or culture. Wong says his <b>self-awareness,</b> and what Hong Kong represents to him, stem from the years he spent abroad. He says that only by living amidst a second culture can one fully come to realise what one represents and where one belongs. A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, homelessness and wandering. Since 2011, his repertoire {{has taken on a}} political dimension.|$|E
5|$|After {{exploring}} {{a number of}} the game's locations, the apprentice gains access to a guarded tunnel and is astonished to discover what lies on the other side. Whereas the valley where Drypeak is located is a dustbowl devoid of vegetation, the lands {{on the other side of}} the tunnel are lush and green, meaning highly illegal shaping is taking place in secret. Serviles, the Shapers' slaves created from life essence, show abnormal intelligence and <b>self-awareness.</b> While still reeling from the revelation of what lies beyond Drypeak, the Shaper apprentice discovers that Shanti has disappeared during one of her escapes from her armed escorts, her necklace lay broken on the grass outside the tunnel. At this point, approximately a quarter of the way through the game, the player's choices expand considerably.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} Sudirman also {{continued}} {{to serve as}} a member of the Muhammadiyah Youth Group. Within the group he was known as a keen negotiator and mediator, working to resolve issues between members; he also preached at the local mosque. He was elected as Chair of the Banyumas District of the Muhammadiyah Youth Group at the end of 1937. In this role he enacted policies facilitating members' studies and activities, both religious and secular. He was later put in charge of Youth Group activities throughout Central Java and spent much of his free time travelling and preaching Islam, putting an emphasis on <b>self-awareness.</b> Alfiah was also active in Muhammadiyah-sponsored activities through the group's branch for women, Nasyiatul Aisyiyah.|$|E
5|$|Elephants have a fission–fusion {{society in}} which {{multiple}} family groups come together to socialise. Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers {{for as long as}} three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have <b>self-awareness</b> and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.|$|E
5|$|However, Shakespeare {{soon began}} to adapt the {{traditional}} styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III {{has its roots in}} the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid <b>self-awareness</b> looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the playable races, {{there are two other}} non-playable Enlightened Races, known as the Zilart and the Kuluu. These ancient races were thought extinct, and are the focus of the first two-game expansions. There is also a large supporting cast of NPCs involved in quests, missions and the game's storylines. The game features several typical Final Fantasy fiends, including Goblins, Sahagins and Tonberries. Several of these races are known as Beastmen, a distinction made between fiends who possess higher than average intelligence, exhibiting <b>self-awareness,</b> emotions, culture, and religion. The complex relationship, bigoted views, and reasons of conflict between the Enlightened Races and Beastmen is a plot point throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Elephants exhibit mirror self-recognition, an {{indication}} of <b>self-awareness</b> and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins. One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later. Elephants are among the species known to use tools. An Asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters. Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps {{to allow them to}} remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. Individuals appear {{to be able to keep}} track of the current location of their family members.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise <b>self-awareness</b> of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E
25|$|<b>Self-awareness</b> is seen, by some, to {{be a sign}} {{of highly}} developed, {{abstract}} thinking. <b>Self-awareness,</b> though not well-defined scientifically, {{is believed to be the}} precursor to more advanced processes like meta-cognitive reasoning (thinking about thinking) that are typical of humans. Research in this field has suggested that cetaceans, among others, possess <b>self-awareness.</b>|$|E

25|$|On a {{more general}} level, it remains {{debatable}} whether recognition of one's mirror image implies <b>self-awareness.</b> Likewise, the converse may also false—one may hold <b>self-awareness,</b> but not present a positive result in a mirror test.|$|E
25|$|Individualism, Responsibility and <b>Self-Awareness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Self-consciousness: {{an acute}} sense of <b>self-awareness.</b> It is a preoccupation with oneself, {{as opposed to}} the {{philosophical}} state of <b>self-awareness,</b> which is the awareness that one exists as an individual being; although some writers use both terms interchangeably or synonymously.|$|E
25|$|Sentience (the {{ability to}} feel, perceive, or to {{experience}} subjectivity) {{is not the}} same as <b>self-awareness</b> (being aware of oneself as an individual). The mirror test is sometimes considered to be an operational test for <b>self-awareness,</b> and the handful of animals that have passed the mirror test are often considered to be self-aware. It remains debatable whether recognition of one's mirror image can be properly construed to imply full <b>self-awareness,</b> particularly given that robots are being constructed which appear to pass the test.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Marten and Psarakos used {{television}} to test dolphin <b>self-awareness.</b> They showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage, and another dolphin. They concluded that their evidence suggested <b>self-awareness</b> rather than social behavior. While this particular study {{has not been}} repeated since then, dolphins have since passed the mirror test.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{it should}} be noted that there has been {{controversy}} over whether self-recognition implies <b>self-awareness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{disagree}} with these findings, {{arguing that the}} results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the Clever Hans effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for primates, because primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. Skeptics argue that behaviors that are said to identify <b>self-awareness</b> resemble existing social behaviors, and so researchers could be misinterpreting <b>self-awareness</b> for social responses to another individual. The researchers counter-argue that the behaviors shown are evidence of <b>self-awareness,</b> as they are very different from normal responses to another individual. Whereas apes can merely touch the mark on themselves with their fingers, cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness; they can only twist and turn themselves to observe the mark.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{identified}} as playing a role in the experience of bodily <b>self-awareness,</b> sense of agency, and sense body ownership.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scientists}} still {{disagree with}} these findings, {{arguing that the}} results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the Clever Hans effect.

The researchers counter-argue that the behaviors shown to evidence <b>self-awareness</b> are very different from normal responses to another dolphin, including paying significantly more attention to another dolphin than towards their mirror image. Whereas apes can merely touch the mark on themselves with their fingers, dolphins show less definitive behavior of <b>self-awareness,</b> twisting and turning themselves to observe the mark.|$|E

25|$|Ramana Maharshi {{approved}} {{a number of}} paths and practices, but recommended self-enquiry as the principal means to remove ignorance and abide in <b>Self-awareness,</b> together with bhakti (devotion) or surrender to the Self.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{are one of}} the {{relatively}} few species to have sufficient <b>self-awareness</b> to recognize themselves in a mirror. Already at 18 months, most human children are aware that the mirror image is not another person.|$|E
25|$|The {{human brain}} {{perceives}} {{the external world}} through the senses, and each individual human is influenced greatly {{by his or her}} experiences, leading to subjective views of existence and the passage of time. Humans are variously said to possess consciousness, <b>self-awareness,</b> and a mind, which correspond roughly to the mental processes of thought. These are said to possess qualities such as <b>self-awareness,</b> sentience, sapience, and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself and one's environment. The extent to which the mind constructs or experiences the outer world is a matter of debate, as are the definitions and validity of many of the terms used above.|$|E
25|$|Current {{art therapy}} {{includes}} {{a vast number}} of other approaches such as: person-centered, cognitive, behavior, Gestalt, narrative, Adlerian, family (systems) and more. The tenets of art therapy involve humanism, creativity, reconciling emotional conflicts, fostering <b>self-awareness,</b> and personal growth.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to the}} {{interpretation}} {{of the results of the}} mirror test, and researchers in one study have identified some potential problems with the test as a means of gauging <b>self-awareness</b> in young children.|$|E
25|$|Mescaline induces a {{psychedelic}} state {{similar to}} those produced by LSD and psilocybin, but with unique characteristics. Subjective effects may include altered thinking processes, an altered sense of time and <b>self-awareness,</b> and closed- and open-eye visual phenomena.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, {{we believe}} that {{individuals}} like to view themselves as noble by offering help. This concept {{is related to the}} notion of <b>self-awareness.</b> If it is true that people focus on the impression they make on others, then public-awareness through the use of accountability cues can stimulate people to give help to each other. However, being surrounded by a lot of bystanders does not automatically create public <b>self-awareness.</b> In fact, in some cases being surrounded by bystanders allows an individual to hide within the crowd and feel anonymous. According to Dr. van Bommel, by introducing an accountability cue, the aim is to eliminate feelings of anonymity and increase the likelihood of them offering help.|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} used test for <b>self-awareness</b> in animals is the mirror test, {{developed}} by Gordon Gallup in the 1970s, in which a temporary dye is placed on an animal's body, and the animal is then presented with a mirror.|$|E
