The song was written by Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg, and produced by Nile Rodgers; Steinberg said that the song was inspired by his personal experiences of romance. [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was chosen for Madonna by Michael Ostin of Warner Bros. Records after listening to a demo sung by Kelly. However, Rodgers initially felt that the song {{did not have a}} sufficient hook and was not suitable for Madonna, but subsequently changed his opinion after the hook was <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mind.|$|E

The book outlined Youngblood's {{drive and}} passion for professional football and reviewed his career, his injuries, his successes, and his failures {{on the football}} field. The book recounts when, between the 1973 and 1974 seasons, Youngblood traveled to Logan, Utah, to help Rams teammates Merlin and Phil Olsen with their summer football camp. An altercation {{in the parking lot}} of a local pub resulted in Youngblood having a [...]44 pistol <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye and the trigger pulled and fortunately the chamber was empty, although other chambers were not. A cut eyelid was the only injury he sustained. After initially pleading innocent, the assailant later pleaded guilty and received a one-year suspended sentence. The book was favorably reviewed by Publishers Weekly as [...] "an unusual sports book".|$|E

As the Kungsholm endured a storm and Geisel suffered from sea sickness, he jotted down a rambling plot that started with [...] "a stupid horse and wagon". To keep himself occupied, he began reciting poetry to the rhythm of the ship's engines and soon found himself saying, [...] "And that is a story that no one can beat, and to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street." [...] For days after they landed, he had the rhythm of the ship's engine <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> head, so, at Helen's suggestion, he decided to write a story based around it.|$|E

500|$|Portrayed {{for most}} of his tenure as a deceiving villain, Paul can often be viewed {{participating}} in unpredictable stories. This arbitrary nature lead Dennis to proclaim [...] "he's a character you never get bored with. Even during times when storylines aren't centred on my character, the writers still come up with little twists for him all the time." [...] Network Ten branded Paul a high flying business man who enjoyed womanising until he met Gail Lewis (Fiona Corke). Other labels the character has are [...] "lothario" [...] and [...] "serial cheat" [...] because of his ill-treatment of the opposite sex. Upon his 2004 return he was portrayed <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> old ways. The writer added Paul was committing dodgy deals and deceiving his neighbours in a bid for revenge. The character despises pity, has a damaged personality and can never be faithful to a romantic partner. Dennis branded Paul as [...] "Mr. Evil" [...] because of Paul's harsh treatment of women, observing that his character treated them like toys, throwing them away when he was bored.|$|E
500|$|Pelé {{was born}} on 23 October 1940, in Três Corações, Minas Gerais, Brazil, the son of Fluminense footballer Dondinho (born João Ramos do Nascimento) and Celeste Arantes. He was the elder of two siblings. He was named after the American {{inventor}} Thomas Edison. His parents decided to remove the [...] "i" [...] and call him [...] "Edson", {{but there was a}} mistake on the birth certificate, leading many documents to show his name as [...] "Edison", not [...] "Edson", as he is called. He was originally nicknamed [...] "Dico" [...] by his family. He received the nickname [...] "Pelé" [...] during his school days, when it is claimed he was given it because of his pronunciation of the name of his favorite player, local Vasco da Gama goalkeeper Bilé, which he misspoke but the more he complained the more it <b>stuck.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> autobiography, Pelé stated {{he had no idea what}} the name means, nor did his old friends. Apart from the assertion that the name is derived from that of Bilé, and that it is Hebrew for [...] "miracle" [...] (פֶּ֫לֶא), the word has no known meaning in Portuguese.|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{described}} Joseph as an [...] "awkward {{and very}} bookish" [...] character, one who struggled {{to relate to}} his patients, {{in contrast to the}} [...] "happy-go-lucky Sam", which resulted in comedy as [...] "Sam is the antithesis of Joe." [...] He also deemed his character [...] "incredibly honest and morally upright", [...] "a total oddball with all sorts of hang-ups", and as being [...] "very <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> ways." [...] During his tenure, these aspects of his characterisation have each been explored. It was revealed in Joseph's first appearance that both his father and grandfather had been pioneering cardiothoracic Consultants, and that it had always been expected of him to follow the same path. [...] His residual guilt over his brother's attempted suicide was developed throughout his first few months at Holby City Hospital. Roberts commented on the event that: [...] "It underpins much of his behaviour. He is a man burdened by guilt and loss. I think I can be so bold as to say he transfers many of his feelings about his brother onto patients and staff alike, without ever betraying the source of his pain." [...] Joseph's resultant fastidiousness developed into OCD, something he attempted to control and hide by use of relaxant medication.|$|E

500|$|A cheery {{and singing}} Ron (who is wearing his [...] "Tiger Woods" [...] outfit, {{which is an}} outfit he wears after having sex) openly {{discusses}} the details [...] his sexual exploits with Tammy to an uncomfortable Leslie. Although she is initially pleased {{with the results of}} her meddling, Leslie soon realizes Tammy is using sex to manipulate Ron to give her control of Lot 48. Leslie confronts Tammy, who admits to the plot and brags that this is how the library operates. Leslie tries to get Ron to break up with Tammy, but he insists he cannot confront her without Leslie's help. The two go to the library, where Ron starts to cave in when Tammy flirts with him. Leslie tells Ron to do whatever will make him happy, even if it means giving up the lot. Ron, impressed that anyone would put his own needs before their own, decides instead to break up with Tammy and give the lot back to Leslie. After breaking the news to Tammy off-camera, he leaves the library with a push-pin <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> forehead, and part of his mustache missing, and he and Leslie flee the library. The two share a drink, where Leslie encourages Ron to insult Tammy.|$|E
500|$|After Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) {{was pushed}} from the Lassiter's Hotel mezzanine, Mark was {{introduced}} {{as the lead}} detective on the case. Mark had his [...] "work cut out for him" [...] as he began questioning the suspects, as they each pointed the finger at someone else. He also received conflicting information as everyone had their own suspicions as to who committed the crime. McGregor revealed that Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) had given Rebecca Robinson (Jane Hall) a false alibi, Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) points out that Diana Marshall (Jane Badler) earring was found {{at the crime scene}} and Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) did not help himself with his attitude towards the investigation. Of the case, McGregor said [...] "Brennan is {{in the thick of the}} investigation so it's pretty exciting, I've never had so much responsibility." [...] McGregor later explained that it had been [...] "great" [...] to be involved in the storyline, even though he did not share many scenes with Dennis, as he was in a hospital bed. Rebecca was revealed to have been the one who pushed Paul and McGregor said that he knew early on in the storyline that she was the culprit. However, Mark did not know that Rebecca was responsible as he had been thrown by the false alibis. McGregor later said that his first week on Neighbours, filming the Who Pushed P.R? storyline, had <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mind as there were many long interview scenes he had to get through.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{said after}} six episodes, he felt [...] "Rock Show" [...] was the episode where the Parks and Recreation {{found the right}} tone for the series and Leslie Knope character. Sepinwall said all the {{characters}} were very likable, the jokes seemed natural and the awkwardness of the show was turned down enough to work properly. The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman said while the first five episodes of the season had been disappointing, [...] "Rock Show" [...] marked an improvement in which [...] "the characters were more defined, their quirks and rhythms understood". Matt Fowler of IGN {{said he did not}} find the episode especially funny but that it {{did a good job of}} fleshing out the characters. He said Chris Pratt was especially funny, and that his band's song [...] "The Pit" [...] was <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> head after the episode. The A.V. Club writer Keith Phipps, who had mixed feelings about Parks and Recreation throughout the season, said [...] "Rock Show" [...] was very funny and restored his faith in the potential of the series. Phipps said he believed the show would become very popular in the second season, and that people would later claim to like the first season more than they did the first time they saw it. In October 2009, while reviewing the second season episode [...] "Sister City", A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said he believed Parks and Recreation showed a streak of vast improvement that started with [...] "Rock Show" [...] and continued into the second season.|$|E
