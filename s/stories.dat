5|$|A {{series of}} 12 short <b>stories</b> were {{serialized}} in the Japanese bishōjo magazine Dengeki G's Magazine, published by ASCII Media Works. The <b>stories,</b> under the collective title Official Episode Collection, {{were published in}} two batches: the first six <b>stories</b> were published between the March 2006 and August 2006 issues, while the second batch of six were serialized between the October 2006 and March 2007 issues. In {{each of the two}} batches, one of the six <b>stories</b> centered on one of the six heroines, and featured illustrations by Itaru Hinoue and Na-Ga. The <b>stories</b> were written by the respective scenario writer for each girl: Jun Maeda wrote Rin's, Leo Kashida wrote Mio's, Yūto Tonokawa wrote Komari's and Yuiko's, and Chika Shirokiri wrote Haruka's and Kudryavka's <b>stories.</b> Key released five volumes of another series of official short <b>stories,</b> written by the original scenario staff and titled Little Busters! SS, on iOS and Android devices between November 1, 2012 and March 7, 2013.|$|E
5|$|After the {{calendar}} <b>stories,</b> Hebel wrote Biblische Geschichten (Bible <b>stories),</b> {{a new school}} book for evangelical religious education. His criteria were {{that it should be}} clearly written and tell biblical <b>stories</b> in an exciting narrative style aimed at children from ten to fourteen. It took five years to write and was completed and released in 1824. It was used as a textbook until 1855.|$|E
5|$|After {{the demise}} of Thrilling Wonder <b>Stories</b> the old Wonder <b>Stories</b> title was revived for two issues, {{published}} in 1957 and 1963. These were both edited by Jim Hendryx Jr. They were numbered vol. 45, no. 1 and 2, continuing the volume numbering of Thrilling Wonder. Both were selections from past issues of Thrilling Wonder; the second one convinced Ned Pines, the publisher who had bought Wonder <b>Stories</b> from Gernsback in 1936 and who still owned {{the rights to the}} <b>stories,</b> to start a reprint magazine called Treasury of Great Science Fiction <b>Stories</b> in 1964; a companion, Treasury of Great Western <b>Stories,</b> was added the next year.|$|E

40|$|Branching <b>story</b> {{games have}} gained {{popularity}} for creating unique playing experiences by adapting <b>story</b> content {{in response to}} user actions. Research in interactive narrative (IN) uses automated planning to generate <b>story</b> plans for a given <b>story</b> problem. However, a <b>story</b> planner can generate multiple <b>story</b> plan solutions, all of which equally-satisfy the <b>story</b> problem definition but contain different <b>story</b> content. These differences in <b>story</b> content are key to understanding the <b>story</b> branches in a <b>story</b> problem 2 ̆ 7 s solution space, however we lack narrative-theoretic metrics to compare <b>story</b> plans. We address this gap by first defining a <b>story</b> plan summarization model to capture the important <b>story</b> semantics from a <b>story</b> plan. Secondly, we define a <b>story</b> plan comparison metric that compares <b>story</b> plans based on the summarization model. Using the Glaive narrative planner and a simple <b>story</b> problem, we demonstrate the usefulness of using the summarization model and distance metric to characterize the different <b>story</b> branches in a <b>story</b> problem 2 ̆ 7 s solution space...|$|R
5|$|Air Wonder <b>Stories</b> and Science Wonder <b>Stories</b> were merged in 1930 as Wonder <b>Stories,</b> and the {{quarterly}} was renamed Wonder <b>Stories</b> Quarterly. The magazines were not financially successful, and in 1936 Gernsback sold Wonder <b>Stories</b> to Ned Pines at Beacon Publications, where, retitled Thrilling Wonder <b>Stories,</b> it continued for nearly 20years. The last issue was dated Winter 1955, {{and the title}} was then merged with Startling <b>Stories,</b> another of Pines' science fiction magazines. Startling itself lasted only {{to the end of}} 1955 before finally succumbing to the decline of the pulp magazine industry.|$|E
