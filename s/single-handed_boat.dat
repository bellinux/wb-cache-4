5000|$|It {{is also a}} {{reasonable}} interpretation of the COLREGs to place the boat [...] "not under command" [...] and to make no way, displaying proper lighting for such, to inform other vessels that a <b>single-handed</b> <b>boat</b> {{is not able to}} perform avoidance maneuvers because the crew is asleep. No legal cases have arisen to date to adjudicate whether or not such an approach is legal, because single-handed sailing is rare and examples of collisions caused by single-handed sailing are difficult to find.|$|E

From 1963-1973 he sailed Optimist, the most popular <b>single-handed</b> <b>boat</b> for {{children}} below the age of 15; 1969 top-sailor worldwide in the Optimist below the age of 12. Sailing OK-Dinghy from 1974-1976 and Finn-Dinghy (Olympic class since 1952) from 1976-1983. In OK and Finn several times national champion; participating in numerous European and World championships at the junior and senior level. In the Finn-class European vice-champion (junior) in Finn in 1979; silver medallist in the Olympic Games in 1980 (Moscow/Tallinn). Since 1983 hobby sailing with occasional dinghy and big-boat racing.|$|E

5000|$|The Starling class yacht was {{conceived}} {{and the design}} commissioned by John Peet in the late 1960s. At the time, there were no <b>single-handed</b> <b>boats</b> available in New Zealand, for bridging {{the gap between the}} P-class and the adult [...] Finn, OK, Cherokee and Zephyr classes. Many young sailors were leaving the sport because the step to the adult classes was too great. A stepping stone class was required. In consultation with parents of current P-class sailors, a set of criteria was formulated for the proposed class: ...|$|R
50|$|Because {{the modern}} 18s {{have such a}} high profile, the term skiff is widely used internationally to refer to other {{high-performance}} sailing dinghy classes, mostly featuring asymmetrical spinnaker and trapeze which have been strongly influenced by modern skiffs. Examples include: Cherub Skiff, International 14, 29er, and 49er. These boats {{tend to be less}} heavily crewed in relation to their length than the traditional Australian Skiff Classes. The term is even used for some <b>single-handed</b> <b>boats</b> like the Musto Performance Skiff which are far removed from the heavily crewed original boats.|$|R
50|$|The Musto Skiff is a single-handed sailing skiff with {{a length}} of 4.55m. It {{features}} a trapeze, asymmetrical spinnaker, wings and low weight and achieves speeds of over twenty knots which makes {{it one of the}} fastest <b>single-handed</b> sailing <b>boats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Seashells {{are small}} {{one or two}} person dinghys with a single {{mainsail}} taught in weekday morning classes to children between 6 and 13 years old. There are three levels of classes, from beginner to expert, A, B and C. Students in C and B classes sail with two children per boat, a captain and a crew. Students in class A sail the <b>boats</b> <b>single-handed.</b> Each class is one hour long, five times a week, and is run in the Inner Lagoon. Seashells cannot sail in the open ocean.|$|R
50|$|Most racing {{dinghies}} can {{be classified}} as being either single-handed (one person only) such as the Laser, RS Vareo or double-handed, such as the 470, 505, Heron, Tasar, Flying Junior, International Fireball or the International Fourteen. A few classes of dinghy carry more than two crew whilst racing, typically heavier dayboat types, but also a couple of high-performance, Australian-origin skiff-type dinghies. Some classes allow children to sail double-handed until a particular age and then require them to compete <b>single-handed.</b> Some double-handed <b>boats</b> are ideal for an adult and child like the Heron, while some such as the Tasar have weight restrictions which ensure they are sailed competitively by two adults or near-adults. Weight equalisation is also used on certain high-performance classes to ensure that comparative levels of performance are attained.|$|R
60|$|It {{had been}} the {{intention}} of our young sailor to stay out all night, had the weather been promising. His wish was to ascertain how he might manage the <b>boat,</b> <b>single-handed,</b> while he slept, and also to learn {{the extent of the}} shoals. As the extraordinary fertility of the crater superseded the necessity of his labouring much to keep himself supplied with food, he had formed a plan of cruising off the shoals, for days at a time, in the hope of falling in with something that was passing, and which might carry him back to the haunts of men. No vessel would or could come in sight of the crater, so long as the existence of the reefs was known; but the course steered by the Rancocus was a proof that ships did occasionally pass in that quarter of the Pacific. Mark had indulged in no visionary hopes on this subject, for he knew he might keep in the offing a twelvemonth and see nothing; but an additional twenty-four hours might realize all his hopes.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMeasurements of wind {{direction}} are sought after by {{a multitude of}} professionals in many different domains. Whether to recalibrate meteorological models or simply for leisure activities, the demand for accurate and responsive wind measurements is widespread. This study was motivated {{by the need to}} improve the responsiveness of direction measurements on yachts. Here we argue that the ideal form factor of the wind sensor can be determined using digital tools, rather than empirically, with the aim of improving the mechanical response of the wind vane. Then we present the results obtained by applying a predictive filter method tailored to the specified form factor. We have developed and experimentally validate a mathematical model describing the dynamic behavior of a wind vane. This model is then used to determine the form factor of the vane that will give the best possible response to perturbations it will encounter. To do so we use operational research tools, specifying the mechanical characteristics of the vane and by providing the future use conditions of the sensor, {{in the form of a}} wind speed spectral density. The design built from this optimization methodology helps reduce the response time of the vane by 44 % compared to to designs currently in use. We then work on digital signal processing by using a predictive filter which takes into account the dynamic characteristics of the vane previously determined by the mathematical model. This step vastly improves the quality and sensitivity of the signal, leading to another reduction in response time of 83 %. This brings the total decrease in response time at 90 %. There is therefore not only an improvement in the quality of {{wind direction}} measurements, but also with respect to the set of data that is derived from this information. In the context of <b>single-handed</b> racing <b>boats,</b> the performance of the automatic pilot directly benefits from this improvement in responsiveness...|$|R
