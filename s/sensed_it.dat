500|$|Arthur Gies of Polygon {{took the}} view that, however strong a first {{impression}} the fundamentals and ideas yielded, the game's overall quality was reduced by being drawn out beyond its capabilities with superfluous material. A more favorable aspect was the combo system, which {{was said to}} channel [...] "early '00s Japanese action games {{in a way that}} feels hard to resist". Traversal challenges and controls were also lauded. Further, Polygon disparaged the design for the game's considerable length, and <b>sensed</b> <b>it</b> was to compensate for the small number of story missions. The loot and crafting system appeared minimal in action and the grinding involved was found to be [...] "annoying" [...] and [...] "a real chore". Mike Williams of USgamer endorsed the combat and platforming's reminiscence to Mega Man Legends and Metroid Prime, respectively. Williams wrote that the corebots were one of ReCores strongest aspects, exhibiting [...] "clear and endearing personalities" [...] notably complemented in cutscenes and gameplay. He judged exploration to be the most robust feature and its fast travel system [...] "generally easy", but thought the story was obstructed by the level-based progression.|$|E
500|$|General Secretary Gorbachev said of {{his former}} rival's Cold War role: [...] " [...] {{a man who was}} {{instrumental}} in bringing {{about the end of the}} Cold War," [...] and deemed him [...] "a great president." [...] Gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war, but rather a peaceful end; he said he was not intimidated by Reagan's harsh rhetoric. Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, said of Reagan, [...] "he warned that the Soviet Union had an insatiable drive for military power... but he also <b>sensed</b> <b>it</b> was being eaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform." [...] She later said, [...] "Ronald Reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the Cold War for liberty and he did it without a shot being fired." [...] Said Brian Mulroney, former Prime Minister of Canada: [...] "He enters history as a strong and dramatic player [...]" [...] Former President Lech Wałęsa of Poland acknowledged, [...] "Reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communism's collapse." [...] That Reagan had little or no effect in ending the Cold War is argued with equal weight; that Communism's internal weakness had become apparent, and the Soviet Union would have collapsed in the end regardless of who was in power. President Harry S. Truman's policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the USSR, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itself.|$|E

5000|$|Reitman {{noted that}} In one <b>sense,</b> <b>it's</b> {{a movie about}} a man who fires people for a living.

In another <b>sense,</b> <b>it's</b> about a man who meets a woman who's so similar to him that even though they both believe in the idea of living solo, they begin to fall in love." ...|$|R
5000|$|Organizational {{architecture}} has {{two very}} different meanings. In one <b>sense</b> <b>it</b> literally refers to the organization's built environment and in another <b>sense</b> <b>it</b> refers to architecture metaphorically, as a structure which fleshes out the organizations.|$|R
50|$|When {{referring}} to populations, “Ionian” defines several groups in Classical Greece. In the narrowest <b>sense</b> <b>it</b> {{referred to the}} region of Ionia in Asia Minor. In a broader <b>sense</b> <b>it</b> {{could be used to}} describe all speakers of the Ionic dialect, which in addition to those in Ionia proper also included the populations of Euboea, the Cyclades, and many cities founded by Ionian colonists. Finally, in the broadest <b>sense</b> <b>it</b> could be used to describe all those who spoke languages of the East Greek group, which included Attic.|$|R
60|$|There {{was some}} subtle hitch in the orderly {{progress}} of affairs. He <b>sensed</b> <b>it</b> in the air. Both of his guests were disposed to silence, and the clean-shaven {{young man had}} developed a trick of staring at {{the man with the}} beard, which was obviously distressing that sensitive person.|$|E
60|$|When I {{said good}} night and went below {{it was with the}} feeling that I had been talking with the one half of some sort of a dual creature. The other half had not spoken. Yet I <b>sensed</b> <b>it</b> there, {{fluttering}} and quick, behind the mask of words and flesh.|$|E
60|$|Salisbury {{might have}} <b>sensed</b> <b>it.</b> He fussed {{with the ball}} {{and took a long}} while to pitch. Reddy's lithe form whirled around and seemed to get into running motion with the crack of the ball. Martin made a {{beautiful}} pick-up of the sharply bounding ball, but {{he might as well have}} saved himself the exertion. The championship sprinter beat the throw by yards.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, English legal {{commentators}} {{used the}} term allegiance in two ways. In one <b>sense,</b> <b>it</b> referred to the deference which anyone, even foreigners, were expected to pay to {{the institutions of the}} country where one lived. In the other <b>sense,</b> <b>it</b> meant national character and the subjection due to that character.|$|R

60|$|On {{this night}} {{the same old}} {{loneliness}} beset Venters, the old habit of sad thought and burning unquiet had its way. But from it evolved a conviction that his useless life had undergone a subtle change. He had <b>sensed</b> <b>it</b> first when Wrangle swung {{him up to the}} high saddle, he knew it now when he lay in the gateway of Deception Pass. He had no thrill of adventure, rather a gloomy perception of great hazard, perhaps death. He meant to find Oldring's retreat. The rustlers had fast horses, but none that could catch Wrangle. Venters knew no rustler could creep upon him at night when Ring and Whitie guarded his hiding-place. For the rest, he had eyes and ears, and a long rifle and an unerring aim, which he meant to use. Strangely his foreshadowing of change did not hold a thought of the killing of Tull. It related only to what was to happen to him in Deception Pass; and he could no more lift the veil of that mystery than tell where the trails led to in that unexplored canyon. Moreover, he did not care. And at length, tired out by stress of thought, he fell asleep.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Pett started violently. There was {{something}} in Ann's voice and, {{as he looked at}} her, something in her face which made him fear the worst. Her eyes were flashing with an inspired light of a highly belligerent nature, and the sun turned the red hair to which she owed her deplorable want of balance to a mass of flame. There {{was something}} in the air. Mr. Pett <b>sensed</b> <b>it</b> with every nerve of his apprehensive person. He gazed at Ann, and as he did so the years seemed to slip from him and he was a boy again, about to be urged to lawless courses by the superior will of his boyhood's hero, Hammond Chester. In the boyhood of nearly every man there is a single outstanding figure, some one youthful hypnotic Napoleon whose will was law and at whose bidding his better judgment curled up and died. In Mr. Pett's life Ann's father had filled this role. He had dominated Mr. Pett at an age when the mind is most malleable. And now--so true is it that though Time may blunt our boyish memories the traditions of boyhood live on in us and an emotional crisis will bring them to the surface as an explosion brings up the fish that lurk in the nethermost mud--it {{was as if he were}} facing the youthful Hammond Chester again and being irresistibly impelled to some course of which he entirely disapproved but which he knew that he was destined to undertake. He watched Ann as a trapped man might watch a ticking bomb, bracing himself for the explosion and knowing that he is helpless. She was Hammond Chester's daughter, and she spoke to him with the voice of Hammond Chester. She was her father's child and she was going to start something.|$|E
60|$|Wade went outdoors, {{and with}} bent head {{walked down the}} street, across a little river, out into green pasture-land. He {{struggled}} with an amazing possibility. Columbine Belllounds might be his own daughter. His heart leaped with joy. But the joy was short-lived. No such hope in this world for Bent Wade! This coincidence, however, {{left him with a}} strange, prophetic sense in his soul of a tragedy coming to White Slides Ranch. Wade possessed some power of divination, some strange gift to pierce the veil of the future. But he could not exercise this power at will; it came involuntarily, like a messenger of trouble in the dark night. Moreover, he had never yet been able to draw away from the fascination of this knowledge. It lured him on. Always his decision had been to go on, to meet this boding circumstance, or to remain and meet it, in the hope that he might take some one's burden upon his shoulders. He <b>sensed</b> <b>it</b> now, in the keen, poignant clairvoyance of the moment--the tangle of life {{that he was about to}} enter. Old Bill Belllounds, big and fine, victim of love for a wayward son; Buster Jack, the waster, the tearer-down, the destroyer, the wild youth at a wild time; Columbine, the girl of unknown birth, good and loyal, subject to a condition sure to ruin her. Wade's strange mind revolved a hundred outcomes to this conflict of characters, but not one of them was the one that was written. That remained dark. Never had he received so strong a call out of the unknown, nor had he ever felt such intense curiosity. Hope had long been dead in him, except the one that he might atone in some way for the wrong he had done his wife. So the pangs of emotion that recurred, in spite of reason and bitterness, were not recognized by him as lingering hopes. Wade denied the human in him, but he thrilled at the thought of meeting Columbine Belllounds. There was something here beyond all his comprehension.|$|E

50|$|The pragmatist Charles S. Peirce {{defines the}} broad {{notion of an}} object as {{anything}} that we can think or talk about.

In a strict <b>sense</b> <b>it</b> refers to any definite being.|$|R

5000|$|Trituration is {{the name}} of several {{different}} methods used to process materials. In one <b>sense,</b> <b>it</b> is a form of comminution (reducing the particle size of a substance). In another <b>sense,</b> <b>it</b> is the production of a homogeneous material by mixing component materials thoroughly.

50|$|Islamic {{philosophy}} is a generic term {{that can be}} defined and used in different ways. In its broadest <b>sense</b> <b>it</b> means the world view of Islam, as derived from the Islamic texts concerning {{the creation of the}} universe and the will of the Creator. In another <b>sense</b> <b>it</b> refers to any of the schools of thought that flourished under the Islamic empire or {{in the shadow of the}} Arab-Islamic culture and Islamic civilization. In its narrowest <b>sense</b> <b>it</b> is a translation of Falsafa, meaning those particular schools of thought that most reflect the influence of Greek systems of philosophy such as Neoplatonism and Aristotelianism.|$|R

50|$|Congress {{formed a}} new caste-based {{election}} combination known as KHAM (Kshtriya-Harijan-Adivasi-Muslim) to elevate them in politics. The upper caste <b>sensed</b> <b>it</b> {{as the end}} of their political importance and reacted strongly against the imposition of Reservations in 1981. This ultimately provoked the anti-Mandal riots in 1985, which later turned anti-Muslim, which helped the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Gujarat.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two common}} {{ways in which}} the term [...] "Line of Actual Control" [...] is used. In the narrow <b>sense,</b> <b>it</b> refers only to the line of control in the western sector of the {{borderland}} between the two countries. In that sense, the LAC forms the effective border between the two countries together with the (also disputed) McMahon Line in the east, and a small undisputed section in between. In the wider <b>sense,</b> <b>it</b> can be used to refer to both the western line of control and the MacMahon Line, in which <b>sense</b> <b>it</b> is the effective border between India and the People's Republic of China (PRC).|$|R
