40|$|First {{asymptotic}} {{relations of}} Voronovskaya-type for rational operators of Shepard-type are shown. A positive answer in <b>some</b> <b>senses</b> {{to a problem}} on the pointwise approximation power of linear operators on equidistant nodes posed by Gavrea, Gonska and Kacso is given. Direct and converse results, computational aspects and Gruss-type inequalities are also proved. Finally an application to images compression is discussed, showing the outperformance of such operators in <b>some</b> <b>senses...</b>|$|R

5|$|I {{was anxious}} that such details {{should be put}} on record because some of these {{regional}} cooking pots are already becoming {{very hard to find}} in France, so that in <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> Juliet Renny's drawings constitute a little historical record in their own right.|$|E
5|$|Some philosophers, such as Paul Boghossian, have {{attempted}} to show that eliminativism is in <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> self-refuting, since the theory itself presupposes the existence of mental phenomena. If eliminativism is true, then the eliminativist must permit an intentional property like truth, supposing {{that in order to}} assert something one must believe it. Hence, for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist must believe that it is true; if that is the case, then there are beliefs and the eliminativist claim is false.|$|E
5|$|Subdivision rules give a {{sequence}} of tilings of a surface, and tilings give an idea of distance, length, and area (by letting each tile have length and area 1). In the limit, the distances that come from these tilings may converge in <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> to an analytic structure on the surface. The Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for this to occur.|$|E

5|$|In the dry season, {{the gray}} mouse lemur faces the {{challenge}} of exploiting sparsely distributed feeding resources efficiently. Results of a recent study on this showed that the gray mouse lemur does not move around randomly, but rather use spatial cues to ﬁnd food resources {{in the absence of}} sensory cues, and that they seem to reuse common, highly efficient routes with regard to travel distance. It is believed that rather than using a route-based network, the gray mouse lemur has <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> of mental representation of their spatial environment, which they use to find and exploit food resources.|$|E
5|$|Spider-Man {{enters the}} lizard room where Connors has taken refuge. Connors knocks {{him out and}} Eddie arrives to help him out. When he regains consciousness, Spider-Man {{comes up with a}} plan to trick him into the polar bear pond. They almost succeed when Connors is alerted by Spider-Man's {{cellphone}} ringing. Billy then arrives and tries to talk <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> into his father, but it is useless and Spider-Man leaps in to get Connors into the pond. Spider-Man pours the cleanser into the mouth of Connors who, as a result, returns to normal, his arm lost once more.|$|E
5|$|There was <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> of {{imminent}} threat in Grand Forks, but the cities could not prepare {{for such an}} enormous flood. The National Weather Service (NWS) had a long-standing forecast for the river to crest at 49feet (14.9m), which was the river's highest level during the 1979 flood. The cities {{had been able to}} get their dikes to this level, but the river continued to rise past it, to the astonishment of the NWS (which did not upgrade its forecast until April 16, the day the river actually reached 49feet). The dikes in the low-lying Lincoln Drive neighborhood of Grand Forks were the first to break, doing so early on April 18. Other dikes over the Grand Forks and East Grand Forks area would fail that day and the next, flooding thousands of homes.|$|E

40|$|There are {{two common}} {{reactions}} to Frege’s claim that <b>some</b> <b>senses</b> and thoughts are private. Privatists accept both private senses and thoughts, while intersubjectivists don’t accept either. Both sides {{agree on a}} pair of tacit assumptions: first, that private senses automatically give rise to private thoughts; and second, that private senses and thoughts are the most problematic entities to which Frege’s remarks on privacy give rise. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show that both assumptions are mistaken. This will motivate a so far neglected, reconciliatory position between privatism and intersubjectivism according to which all thoughts are public while <b>some</b> <b>senses</b> are private...|$|R
5|$|Though {{the details}} would be {{modified}} {{in light of}} his later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of Mysterium Cosmographicum. His subsequent main astronomical works were in <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> only further developments of it, concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it. In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of Mysterium, half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.|$|E
5|$|Directed pseudoforests and endo{{function}}s are in <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> mathematically equivalent. Any function ƒ from a set X {{to itself}} (that is, an endomorphism of X) {{can be interpreted}} as defining a directed pseudoforest which has an edge from x to y whenever ƒ(x) = y. The resulting directed pseudoforest is maximal, and may include self-loops whenever some value x has ƒ(x) = x. Alternatively, omitting the self-loops produces a non-maximal pseudoforest. In the other direction, any maximal directed pseudoforest determines a function ƒ such that ƒ(x) is the target of the edge that goes out from x, and any non-maximal directed pseudoforest can be made maximal by adding self-loops and then converted into a function in the same way. For this reason, maximal directed pseudoforests are sometimes called functional graphs. Viewing a function as a functional graph provides a convenient language for describing properties that are not as easily described from the function-theoretic point of view; this technique is especially applicable to problems involving iterated functions, which correspond to paths in functional graphs.|$|E
5|$|During most of de Coventre's {{recorded}} lifetime Scotland {{was ruled}} by King David II. Coming {{to the throne}} at age five, King David was driven into exile in France {{at the age of}} ten. In the 1330s, civil war raged in Scotland as those loyal to David fought Edward Balliol and his English backers. In <b>some</b> <b>sense,</b> the conflict became a side-show of the Hundred Years' War, and David resided at Château Gaillard in northern France for much of his exile, until he could return to Scotland in 1341. In 1346, in response to a plea from France to come to its aid, David led an army into England only to be taken prisoner at Neville's Cross; he remained in captivity until he was ransomed in 1357. David's exile in France corresponded with Walter's own period in that country, prompting one historian to suggest that Walter was part of David's court while both were in northern France, and that Walter subsequently benefited from the relationship.|$|E
50|$|Many {{scholarly}} and popular interpreters {{have argued that}} a prophecy may have a dual fulfillment; others have argued {{for the possibility of}} multiple fulfillments. In <b>some</b> <b>senses</b> this has been occasionally referred to as an apotelesmatic interpretation of specific prophecies.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to dualism, monism {{does not accept}} any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia. In Indian and Chinese philosophy, monism is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are physicalist. Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> of that term to be clarified by our best science. However, a variety of formulations (see below) are possible. Another form of monism, idealism, states that the only existing substance is mental. Although pure idealism, {{such as that of}} George Berkeley, is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called panpsychism, according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and David Ray Griffin.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{discussion}} in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called analytic philosophy (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy). Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of continental philosophy. In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, {{in relation to the}} philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label (phenomenology, existentialism, etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to {{the discussion}} of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.|$|E
