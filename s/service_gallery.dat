50|$|One director, Ian Robertson, {{initiated}} a programme {{to establish an}} outpost of the Museum in the garrison town of Catterick, North Yorkshire, {{to be known as}} National Army Museum North, on the model of Imperial War Museum's establishment of the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester. A large site was chosen near Marne Barracks, beside the A1, and in 2002 Simon Pierce of Austin-Smith:Lord was chosen as the new museum's architect. However, funding and planning issues later led to the cancellation of the plan in 2003. The National Army Museum instead underwent a major redevelopment of its gallery and corridor displays at Chelsea from 2006 onwards, establishing new displays in existing permanent display areas, converting the corridors from oil-painting displays to permanent-exhibition spaces, and producing new temporary and permanent display areas on the third floor. This redisplay concluded {{with the opening of the}} new permanent National <b>Service</b> <b>gallery</b> in October 2010, though a further phase of redevelopment followed from 2011 onwards.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} CNGS {{project is}} to prove the {{existence}} of neutrino oscillation by generating an intense neutrino beam from CERN {{in the direction of}} the Gran Sasso laboratory in Italy, where two large neutrino detectors are built to detect the neutrinos.

The ventilation and air-conditioning systems installed in these underground areas have multiple tasks.

50|$|There are a {{total of}} five air shafts, two of which have nearby <b>service</b> <b>galleries</b> leading off {{horizontally}} to the cliffs which were used to dump spoil while carving out the tunnels, the air shafts were capped in 1958. The southern half of the tunnel is considerably damp with the tunnel being flooded to about 6 inches on the southern 300 yards. The southern portal of the Sandsend tunnel is bricked up and it can only be accessed via the northern portal of the Kettleness tunnel by walking through the Kettleness tunnel and the area between the tunnels which is overgrown with grass and trees. The northern portal of the Sandsend tunnel partially collapsed in 2008 after years of pressure from the cliff above.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{possibility}} of installing a double-circuit gas insulated transmission line (GIL) in the pilot tunnel of the new planned railway galleries Fortezza–Innsbruck. The high GIL power ratings with very low power losses would allow a strong and highly efficient energy exchange particularly useful for the future European Market and could represent a new fundamental step in reconstructing the European interconnection network. Two separate railway tunnels (9. 6 m) will run under the Brenner Pass from Fortezza (Italy) to Innsbruck (Austria) but will be preceded by the construction of a continuous pilot tunnel (4. 3 m) useful for work logistics and chiefly for detection of the rock stratigraphy. Once the whole work will be over, the pilot tunnel will be used as a <b>service</b> <b>gallery</b> (drainage of water) where a double-circuit GIL can efficiently be installed. The paper gives the main characteristics of planned galleries, several details on the transmission line and its performance, the electro-magnetic field impact considering the proximity effects and the earthing arrangement in order to zero the touch-voltages in case of phase-to-enclosure short-circuits. The chief features of GIL solution are the lowest transmission power losses and the absence of shunt reactive compensation for this line length (appr. 65 km) but mostly the safety of personnel in case of short-circuit and the possibility of usual re-closure cycles for operation continuity. This paper gives an overview of other analysis: GIL no-load regime, electromagnetic interferences between railway and GIL system, pilot tunnel ventilation and GIL thermal regime. In order to achieve satisfying power flows, the new link requires both Italian=Austrian regional grids (380 kV- 110 kV) to be restructured and rationalized. This research is supported by European Community in the framework of TEN-ENERGY programme for analyzing both, technical and environmental issues of integrating 380 kV gas insulated transmission line and rail transport in tunnel between Italy and Austria entitled,,Studies for a new 380 kV transmission line between Italy and Austria through the Brenner pass: Integration of Electricity and Rail Transport in Tunnel‘‘.
