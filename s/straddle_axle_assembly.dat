50|$|Recumbent tadpole {{or reverse}} trike is a {{recumbent}} design with two steered wheels {{at the front}} and one driven wheel at the back, though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers. Steering is either through a single handlebar linked with tie rods to the front wheels' stub <b>axle</b> <b>assemblies</b> (indirect) or with two handlebars (rather, two half-handlebars) each bolted to a steerer tube, usually through a bicycle-type headset and connected to a stub <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> (direct). A single tie rod connects {{the left and right}} <b>axle</b> <b>assemblies.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the overall}} {{requirements}} {{for the design of}} the drive bridge is analysed, the programme of the structure on the drive <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> and component parts is studied. The overall design and programme design on the drive <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> is finished; the basic structure of the double reduction final drive and the middle tandem axle is ensured which refers to the structure of the reference model CA 1092; The basic components on the drive <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> are designed. The calculation of their basic geometric parameters is finished, and the strength of the parts which have greater impact on the overall strength is checked; and the remaining components are designed briefly. The paper gave a briefing on the characteristics of Solidworks 2008 software and virtual assembly technology.

40|$|Abstract. Abnormal {{vibration}} of {{a vehicle}} rear axle was detected during bench test. 3 D model and finite element model of the rear axle were built and the vibration modes were computed. It {{was found that the}} frequency of abnormal vibration in the bench test just matched the frequency of the first bending mode of the rear <b>axle</b> <b>assembly.</b> Therefore it can be concluded that the resonance of rear <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> result in the abnormal vibration and some measures are necessary, such as strengthening the half-axle sleeve or installing vibration absorber. ...|$|R

5000|$|Other {{changes were}} {{in store for}} the Plymouth Duster. Simpler single-piston slider-type disc brake {{calipers}} were introduced for 1973 (standard on 318-powered cars and with power-assist on 340 models), replacing the Kelsey Hayes four-piston calipers. Disc brake-equipped Dusters now had the more-common 5-lugs on 4.5" [...] wheel bolt pattern. All 340 and some 318 engine-equipped cars received the simplified 8.25" [...] rear <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> (with wheel bearings riding directly on the axle shaft and endplay being taken by C-clips); these axles also featured the 5-on-4.5" [...] wheel bolt pattern. (This <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> replaced the 8.75" [...] "drop-out" [...] arrangement seen on some 1966-1972 A-bodies). The 225-powered cars retained the 5-lugs on 4" [...] pattern on vehicles with the standard drum brakes. A three speed Torque Flight automatic along with a manual transmission was offered with the 225 slant six. All models received larger front wheel bearings and increased spindle diameter. Electronic ignition became standard across the board.|$|R
5|$|FF Developments, in {{addition}} to their design work on the gearbox and rear <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> were given responsibility for their manufacture. The aluminium chassis components and body panels were manufactured and assembled at Abbey Panels factory in Coventry, before the body in white was delivered to the assembly plant at Bloxham. The car, including chassis and body components, consists of approximately 3000 unique parts.|$|R
50|$|Rigid axles {{front and}} back were {{suspended}} using leaf springs. The drive shaft was enclosed in a steel tube and featured only a single universal joint, positioned just behind the gearbox. The rear wheel bearings were positioned directly on the rear axle. The overall rear <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> {{seems to have been}} unusually simple, but the resulting stresses gave rise to a shortened axle life.|$|R
50|$|A {{wheelset}} is {{the wheel}} - <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> of a railroad car. The frame assembly beneath {{each end of}} a car, railcar or locomotive that holds the wheelsets is called the bogie (or truck in North America). Most North American freight cars have two bogies {{with two or three}} wheelsets, {{depending on the type of}} car; short freight cars generally have no bogies but instead have two wheelsets.|$|R

50|$|GM {{built the}} $75 million Lordstown Assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio near Youngstown {{to make the}} Vega.

2500|$|Ford Racing Performance Group {{provided}} Shelby its FR1 Power Pack to add 25 horsepower to {{the existing}} Mustang GT powertrain with an additional 10ft/lb of torque. The package included a 90mm cold air kit, muffler kit, a new X-pipe and Ford Racing [...] "GTA" [...] axle-back mufflers. The Ford Shelby GT-H also had the Ford Racing Handling Pack (FR3) which included specially tuned dampers, lowering springs, sway bars, strut tower brace, and a Ford Racing 3.55:1 ratio rear <b>axle</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|R
50|$|At high mileages, this {{is prone}} to wear of the axle {{mounting}} bushes which is easily fixed. It is also prone to wear in the rear axle trailing arm bearings, which then wear the trailing arm axle tubes, requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement <b>axle</b> <b>assembly.</b> The diesel and larger capacity petrol engines are canted {{as far back as}} possible in the engine bay, in an effort to put as much weight as possible behind the front axle line, also reducing the centre of gravity, while improving weight distribution and minimising understeer.|$|R
50|$|The Audi Pikes Peak was {{developed}} in a short five-month period after the initial conceptualization and design. The car employs several parts from fellow Volkswagen Group vehicles, {{including the use of}} the front and rear <b>axle</b> <b>assemblies</b> from the Touareg, as well as the air-suspension technology also taken from the Touareg and Audi’s A8. The suspension settings can be set to the driver’s preference through a four-level adjustable system. It is capable of manipulating the vehicle’s ride-height, from a range of 7 to 11 inches, allowing it to adapt to a variety of road surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|A {{semi-trailer}} is {{a trailer}} without a front axle. A {{large proportion of}} its weight is supported either by a road tractor or by a detachable front <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> known as a dolly. A semi-trailer is normally equipped with legs, called [...] "landing gear", which can be lowered to support it when it is uncoupled. In the United States, a single trailer cannot exceed a length of 57 ft on interstate highways (unless a special permit is granted), although {{it is possible to}} link two smaller trailers together to a maximum length of 63 ft.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{fifth wheel}} {{comes from a}} similar {{coupling}} used on four-wheel horse-drawn carriages and wagons. The device allowed the front <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> to pivot in the horizontal plane, to facilitate turning. Basically a wheel {{was placed on the}} rear frame section of the truck, which back then only had four wheels; this wheel that was placed on the frame was the [...] "fifth wheel", hence the name. The trailer needed to be raised so that the trailer's pin would be able to drop into the central hole of the fifth wheel.|$|R
