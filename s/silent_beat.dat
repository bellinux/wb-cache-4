50|$|The {{initiation}} {{of a song}} that begins with a musical upbeat. The Sacred Harp norm is to start singing the moment the leader moves his hand.

5000|$|Kumath Raman Nair (2001), {{the most}} famous solo kombu artist from Trichur, states that kombu pattu can be played in six talams (beats in brackets): chempata (8), atanta (14), dhruvam (14), chempha (10), anchatantha (16), and thriputa (7). Each cycle is accented with the {{accompanying}} ilatalam cymbals. For instance, thriputa talam is played x [...] x [...] [...] x [...] x [...] x [...] x [...] [...] (broken down to 14 pulses for diagrammatic presentation), and chempata x [...] x [...] x [...] u [...] (represented as eight pulses; 'u' indicates a <b>silent</b> <b>beat).</b> Like the other kshetram genres, kombu pattu is played in a steadily increasing tempo with decreasing rhythm units.|$|E

60|$|Hetty {{whipped the}} team, {{and with a}} {{whirling}} of dusty snow beneath the runners, they swept away. Both sat <b>silent,</b> until the <b>beat</b> of hoofs rang amidst the trees as they swept through the gloom of the big bluff at a gallop, and Hetty laughed excitedly.|$|R
5000|$|Notice that palmas {{are often}} (though {{by no means}} always) <b>silent</b> during <b>beats</b> 4 to 6, even if beat number 6 is a [...] "strong one". This is {{specially}} true when no dancing takes place: the main interest there is the singing (or playing) and too much percussion can take {{attention away from the}} music. Those beats though are often marked when there is dance, or when performing other palos in the same metre like Alegrías or Bulería por soleá. However, these are not to be taken as hard-and-fast rules, but just as general guidelines.|$|R

She was not nominated for the race, and neither her connections nor the public gave her any consideration as a Derby contender. But that all changed with an incredible series of stakes victories against males over the 2011/12 summer - the Group 2 Championship Stakes on January 1, the Group 3 Waikato Guineas on January 28 and the Group 2 Avondale Guineas on February 18. In these races <b>Silent</b> Achiever emphatically <b>beat</b> most other serious Derby contenders and established herself as the outright favourite for the race.|$|R
5000|$|According to Guyún, Delfin was {{responsible}} for changing the style used to accompany boleros. In the 1920s, boleros were often accompanied by guitar in rayado or rasgueado manner (~strumming); Delfin changed that to a semi-arpeggio style (~picking). He also repeated the rhythm by time and a half, leaving the weak part of the second <b>beat</b> <b>silent.</b> His style became widely popular. His compositions include poetry put to music, such as La Guinda, from a poem by Pedro Mata, and he also wrote his own lyrics, such as Y tú qué has hecho?

40|$|We {{performed}} experiments using Aplysia neurons {{to identify}} the mechanism underlying {{the changes in the}} firing patterns in response to temperature changes. When the temperature was gradually increased from 11 ℃ to 31 ℃ the firing patterns changed sequentially from the <b>silent</b> state to <b>beating,</b> doublets, beating-chaos, bursting-chaos, square-wave bursting, and bursting-oscillation patterns. When the temperature was decreased over the same temperature range, these sequential changes in the firing patterns reappeared in reverse order. To simulate this entire range of spiking patterns we modified nonlinear differential equations that Chay and Lee made using temperature-dependent scaling factors. To refine the equations, we also analyzed the spike pattern changes in the presence of potassium channel blockers. Based on the solutions of these equations and potassium channel blocker experiments, we found that, as temperature increases, the maximum value of the potassium channel relaxation time constant, τn(t) increases, but the maximum value of the probabilities of openings for activation of the potassium channels, n(t) decreases. Accordingly, the voltage-dependent potassium current is likely to play {{a leading role in the}} temperature-dependent changes in the firing patterns in Aplysia neurons...|$|R
60|$|The {{three had}} been {{crossing}} {{the level of}} sand, and were now not more than twenty-five paces from him. They had again set down the chest, upon which the white man with the long queue and the gold ear-rings had seated to rest himself, the negro standing close beside him. The moon shone as bright as day and full upon his face. It was looking directly at Tom Chist, every line as keen cut with white lights and black shadows {{as though it had}} been carved in ivory and jet. He sat perfectly motionless, and Tom drew back with a start, almost thinking he had been discovered. He lay <b>silent,</b> his heart <b>beating</b> heavily in his throat; but there was no alarm, and presently he heard the counting begin again, and when he looked once more he saw they were going away straight across the little open. A soft, sliding hillock of sand lay directly in front of them. They did not turn aside, but went straight over it, the leader helping himself up the sandy slope with his cane, still counting and still keeping his eyes fixed upon that which he held in his hand. Then they disappeared again behind the white crest on the other side.|$|R
40|$|Here {{we present}} {{data on the}} {{reproductive}} behavior of Leptodactylus mystacinus (Burmeister, 1861), including details on courtship behavior. We also describe and compared the courtship calls of L. mystacinus, L. furnarius Sazima & Bokermann, 1978 and Leptodactylus sp. (L. aff. andreae). Field works were conducted in Uberlândia (central Brazil). During courtship, a female approaches a calling male and is led to a previously excavated chamber; a female can approach a <b>silent</b> male that <b>beat</b> his hands and/or {{feet on the ground}} as well. The courtship call of L. mystacinus consists of one single arch-shaped note (duration = 0. 04 s) repeated 258 times per minute; the courtship calls of L. furnarius (0. 06 s, 84 times per minute) and Leptodactylus sp. (0. 15 s, 5 times per minute) also are arch-shaped. The courtship behavior of L. mystacinus {{is similar to that of}} other species of the L. fuscus (Schneider, 1799) group; unique to it is that males can beat his hands and/or feet on the ground while courting. The male behavior of conducting the female to a previously excavates chamber and the arch-shaped courtship call may represent other shared derived features of members of the L. fuscus group, including the former Adenomera species...|$|R
60|$|About {{nine o'clock}} in {{the evening of the}} 26th, Sir Henry Clinton began his march from Flatlands with the vanguard, {{composed}} of light infantry. Lord Percy followed with the grenadiers, artillery, and light dragoons, forming the centre. Lord Cornwallis brought up the rear-guard with the heavy ordnance. General Howe accompanied this division. It was a <b>silent</b> march, without <b>beat</b> of drum or sound of trumpet, under guidance of a Long Island tory, along by-roads traversing a swamp by a narrow causeway, and so across the country to the Jamaica road. About two hours before daybreak, they arrived within half a mile of the pass through the Bedford Hills, and halted to prepare for an attack. At this juncture they captured an American patrol, and learnt, to their surprise, that the Bedford pass was unoccupied. In fact, the whole road beyond Bedford, leading to Jamaica, had been left unguarded, excepting by some light volunteer troops. Colonels Williams and Miles, who were stationed to the left of Colonel Hand, among the wooded hills, had been instructed to send out parties occasionally to patrol the road, but no troops had been stationed at the Bedford pass. The road and pass may not have been included in General Greene's plan of defence, or may have been thought too far out of the way to need special precaution. The neglect of them, however, proved fatal.|$|R
60|$|I {{could hear}} Giles and Aymeric steal across the way, and the {{rustling}} of boughs as they {{settled on the}} opposite side. I could hear the trampling hoofs of horses coming slowly and wearily from the east. At this moment chanced a thing that has ever seemed strange to me: I felt {{the hand of the}} violer woman laid lightly and kindly on my hair. I had ever pitied her, and, as I might, had been kind to her and her bairn; and now, as it appears, she pitied me. But there could be no help in her, nor did she dare to raise her voice and give an alarm. So I could but gnaw at my gag, trying to find scope for my tongue to cry, for now it was not only the travellers that I would save, but my own life, and my escape from a death of torment lay on my success. But my mouth was as dry as a kiln, my tongue was doubled back till I thought that I should have choked. The night was now deadly still, and the ring of the weary hoofs drew nearer and nearer. I heard a stumble, and the scramble of a tired horse as he recovered himself; for the rest, all was <b>silent,</b> though the <b>beating</b> of my own heart sounded heavy and husky in my ears.|$|R
50|$|Ryan {{then had}} a brief absence from PWG. When he returned, he began teaming with Scott Lost and Chris Bosh, which lead many to {{question}} his actions. He would then set out {{to prove that he}} is the best technical wrestler. He challenged and defeated many wrestlers who are known to have great technical skills, such as Alex Shelley, Claudio Castagnoli, Rocky Romero, and Chris Hero. Though he won the matches, Ryan had to cheat and use help from Lost or Bosh to win, since he would usually be outwrestled each match. On December 3, 2005, at Chanukah Chaos (The C's Are <b>Silent),</b> Joey Ryan <b>beat</b> Kevin Steen for the PWG Championship after Super Dragon, who was feuding with the Champion, gave Steen two Psycho Drivers. He made his first defense at CZW's Cage of Death 7 against El Generico. Ryan began defeating a number of wrestlers using some under handed tactic or a sheer stroke of luck on his behalf. It was around this time that Ryan changed his appearance to resemble Tom Selleck from Magnum, P.I., which included a big moustache. He even changed his finisher name from the Duff Drop to the Moustache Ride. Some of the wrestlers he has defeated include Chris Kanyon, Human Tornado, Chris Bosh, A.J. Styles, Emil Sitoci, Jonny Storm, Kevin Steen, Chris Sabin, Super Dragon, Necro Butcher, Frankie Kazarian, Davey Richards, and B-Boy. Ryan became at the time the longest reigning champion, and made the title a World title in the process by defending it in Europe.|$|R
500|$|Reviews were universally {{less than}} {{positive}} on other systems. While critics praised {{the idea of}} the game, they found fault in the execution. Several critics disliked that the troops spawned by the player simply walk past the troops spawned by the opponent without the two groups fighting. The game's flow also attracted significant criticism, with Peter Eykemans of IGN saying [...] "Even on double speed, the pace is painful. This makes a simple two-person battle turn into a lengthy saga of repeating the same actions over and over again." [...] and Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly complaining of [...] "long drawn out matches on even the easiest difficulty settings as you try to force your way past a virtual stalemate". While the visuals did receive praise, critics felt that they also {{got in the way of}} allowing the player to tell what was going on in the game. Opinions about the narrator were mixed. Henry Winchester of PC Gamer praised the voiceover, calling it [...] "a pleasingly booze-obsessed voiceover, delivered by what sounds like a Dalek doing an impression of Sean Connery". Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly was less kind, stating that [...] "your narrator and chief advisor sounds like an awful Sean Connery impersonator and he may be the best of the voice actors you come across". GamesRadar strikes a more neutral tone, stating that [...] "Pre and post-battle dialog is fully voiced by what are only technically 'actors,' but it definitely <b>beats</b> <b>silent</b> text, and does add a bit of flavor to the world." [...] Multiplayer also received mixed reviews. Eykemans of IGN suggested that multiplayer exacerbates the length and flow issues already present in the single player game, while Matt Hughes of GamesRadar calls multiplayer the game's [...] "biggest asset", stating that [...] "Playing against real humans definitely ramps up the intensity and reduces the cheap exploitation found in the campaign.".|$|R
