This methods also utilizes a <b>separation</b> <b>gel</b> made of an acrylamide-pendent Phos-Tag monomer that is copolymerized.

50|$|In this method, the gel {{is divided}} into two parts, resolving and {{stacking}} gel, both have different concentrations of polyacrylamide. The one with lower concentration is stacked on top of the one with higher concentration. Discontinuity is based on four parameters: gel structure, pH value of the buffer, ionic strength of the buffer, {{and the nature of the}} ions in the gel and electrode buffer. The electrode buffer contains glycine. Glycine has very low net charge at pH 6.8 of stacking gel, so it has low mobility. The proteins are separated according to the principle of isotachophoresis and form stacks in the order of mobility (stacking effect). Mobility depends on net charge, not on the size of the molecule. Proteins move towards anode slowly at constant speed till they reach limit of <b>separation</b> <b>gel.</b> Suddenly, frictional resistance increases but glycine is not affected and it passes the proteins and becomes highly charged in resolving zone. Proteins present in homogeneous buffer start to separate based on principles of zone electrophoresis. Now their mobility depends on size as well as charge. pH value rises to 9.5 and net charge increases.|$|E

Although the blood clot remaining within the serum-separation tube after serum collection is a source of DNA, recovery of the clot from the tube is a significant challenge.

40|$|A {{new method}} for multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, based on electrophoretic {{transfers}} to nitrocellulose after polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis was explored. Electrophoretic separation {{was performed on}} 1 -mm-thick slab gels with 6 -μl samples of bacterial extracts and was followed by serial 5 -min consecutive transfers. The transferability of 19 metabolic enzymes of Klebsiella strains was studied and allowed the simultaneous examination of one enzyme in the <b>separation</b> <b>gel</b> and at least five enzymes on nitrocellulose sheets. The resolution of enzyme bands was increased on nitrocellulose; thus, well-separated bands were recorded for nucleoside phosphorylase, peptidase, and phosphoglucose isomerase whereas their mobility variants could not be clearly distinguished in the <b>separation</b> <b>gel</b> because of stain diffusion. The study of genetic relationships of 42 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 24 strains of Klebsiella oxytoca demonstrated {{the reliability of the}} method, since clustering analysis of electrophoretic types, based on electrophoretic polymorphism of 10 metabolic enzymes, showed two main clusters well correlated with the two species.

40|$|Most {{strains of}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae harbor a {{double-stranded}} RNA (dsRNA) molecule, called W. We obtained W cDNA clones by random priming of denatured W dsRNA followed by reverse transcription. Sequence data of W shows that only one strand ((+) -strand) has coding capacity for a protein with 829 amino acids which spans almost {{the entire length of}} the molecule (2. 5 kilobases). Within this protein we found a sequence pattern characteristic of RNA dependent RNA polymerases of (+) -strand and double-stranded RNA viruses. W has no homology with other dsRNAs found in S. cerevisiae, such as L-A, L-BC or M 1. However, a (+) -strand-specific probe for W hybridized with 20 -S RNA. Furthermore, W (+) -strands comigrated with 20 S RNA in strand <b>separation</b> <b>gels.</b> These results suggest that 20 S RNA is a (+) -single-stranded RNA form of W dsRNA itself or a closely related molecule.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} immense {{interest}} in studying gels derived from low molecular mass gelators (supramolecular, or simply molecular gels). The motivation for this is not only to understand the fundamental aggregate structures in the gels at different length scales, but also to explore their potential for futuristic technological applications. Gels have been made sensitive to external stimuli like light and chemical entities by incorporating a spectroscopically active or a receptor unit as part of the gelator molecule. This makes them suitable for applications such as sensing and actuating. The diversity of gel structural architectures has allowed them to be utilized as templates to prepare novel inorganic superstructures for possible applications in catalysis and <b>separation.</b> <b>Gels</b> derived from liquid crystals (anisotropy gels) that can act as dynamically functional materials have been prepared, for example, for (re-writable) information recording. Supramolecular gels can be important in controlled release applications, in oil recovery, for gelling cryogenic fuels etc. They can also serve as media for a range of applications.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Elevated plasma {{levels of}} the elastase alpha 1 -proteinase {{inhibitor}} complex (E-alpha 1 PI) have been proposed as a marker of bacterial infection and neutrophil activation. Liberation of elastase from neutrophils after collection of blood may cause falsely elevated results. Collection methods have not been validated for critically ill neonates and children. We evaluated the influence of preanalytical methods on E-alpha 1 PI results including the recommended collection into EDTA tubes. DESIGN AND METHODS: First, we compared varying acceleration speeds and centrifugation times. Centrifugation at 1550 g for 3 min resulted in reliable preparation of leukocyte free plasma. Second, we evaluated all collection tubes under consideration for absorption of E-alpha 1 PI. Finally, 12 sets of samples from healthy adults and 42 sets obtained from critically ill neonates and children were distributed into the various sampling tubes. Samples were centrifuged within 15 min of collection and analyzed with a new turbidimetric assay adapted to routine laboratory analyzers. RESULTS: One of the two tubes containing a plasma-cell <b>separation</b> <b>gel</b> absorbed 22. 1 % of the E-alpha 1 PI content. In the remaining tubes without absorption of E-alpha 1 PI no differences were observed for samples from healthy adult patients. However, in samples from critically ill neonates or children, significantly higher results were obtained for plain Li-heparin tubes (mean = 183 micrograms/L), EDTA tubes (mean = 93 micrograms/L), and citrate tubes (mean = 88. 5 micrograms/L) than for the Li-hep tube with cell-plasma <b>separation</b> <b>gel</b> and no absorption of E-alpha 1 PI (mean = 62. 4 micrograms/L, p < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: Contrary to healthy adults, E-alpha 1 PI results in plasma samples from critically ill neonates and children depend {{on the type of}} collection tube...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{describe}} a microfluidic Western blot assay (μWestern) using a Tris tricine discontinuous buffer system suitable for analyses {{of a wide}} molecular mass range (6. 5 − 116 kDa). The Tris tricine μWestern is completed in an enclosed, straight glass microfluidic channel housing a photopatterned polyacrylamide gel that incorporates a photoactive benzophe-none methacrylamide monomer. Upon brief ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, the hydrogel toggles from molecular sieving for size-based separation to a covalent immobilization scaffold for in situ antibody probing. Electrophoresis controls all assay stages, affording purely electronic operation with no pumps or valves needed for fluid control. Electrophoretic introduction of antibody into and along the molecular sieving gel requires that the probe must traverse through (i) a discontinuous gel interface central to the transient isotachophoresis used to achieve high-performance separations and (ii) the full axial length of the <b>separation</b> <b>gel.</b> In-channel antibody probing of small molecular mass species is especially challenging, since the gel must effectively sieve small proteins while permitting effective probing with large-molecular...|$|E
