500|$|After marrying Sara Fricker {{in autumn}} 1795, Coleridge left their home at Clevedon {{and began to}} travel {{throughout}} England {{in order to meet}} with various philosophers and political theorists. In part, he was trying to meet with people so he could raise subscriptions for his various works. During this time, he would write home constantly to his pregnant wife and was concerned about her state of health. His feelings of guilt, along with a fever that he treated with laudanum, affected him greatly and caused him to express these feelings in a letter to Josiah Wade on 10 February 1796: [...] "My past life <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a dream, a feverish dream! all one gloomy huddle of strange actions, and dim-discovered motives! Friendships lost by indolence, and happiness murdered by mismanaged sensibilities." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Convict" [...] was {{the first}} Office episode to be {{directed}} by Jeffrey Blitz, who later won an Emmy Award for the fifth season episode [...] "Stress Relief". In a departure from series routine, Gervais and Merchant were not present on set for much of filming, though episode writers had typically been available in the past. Actress Kate Flannery found the episode [...] "a {{lot of fun to}} shoot," [...] and observed that on the occasions Gervais was present, [...] "it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> he is looking at all of us with a sense of, 'I can't believe that this exists because of me.' That is just my interpretation, but he seems so humble, and kind of reverent." [...] One scene was meant to take place outdoors under cold temperatures, so the parking lot set was laden with fake snow and slush. Also present on set were two sets of twin babies, as the character of Hannah Smotridge-Barr brings her son to the office.|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> this," [...] she began, {{doing her}} best first to {{recollect}} {{and then to}} expose her shivering private visions.|$|E
50|$|Nobody has {{interfered}} with that fight, which <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> {{everything in this}} city: A pseudo-something.|$|R
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a {{very long}} time before the {{sergeant}} joined us, and then I knew that the unfortunate men were out of their misery at last.|$|R
60|$|This {{little boat}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a vicious wasp, as {{it left the}} side of the ship with a rapid {{throbbing}} of its engine and twirling of its miniature screw.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have fancied, sir, {{for some}} time, that I heard noises. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the splash {{of a very}} large number of oars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'No,' he said, after cogitating for a minute, 'carn't say I do; I {{never can}} {{remember}} much about Smythe. He allers <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a bad dream.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is very brilliant," [...] said Gertrude. [...] "But I can't tell yet. She <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> {{a singer}} singing an air. You can't tell till {{the song is}} done." ...|$|E
6000|$|A. Why, {{have you}} noticed that? (Shaking hands.) Many a time it has <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a discrepancy, but somehow I couldn't make up my mind. How quick you notice a thing! ...|$|R
60|$|I rather {{avoided the}} old chest after this. It {{took on a}} new {{significance}} in my eyes and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the tomb of something--possibly some dead and buried romance of the past.|$|R
5000|$|During oral {{arguments}} before the three-judge appeals panel, Judge E. Grady Jolly remarked that [...] "For some reason, this one {{got out of}} hand it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> ... It does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the government overreacted here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't London wonderful!" [...] {{she murmured}} dreamily. [...] "On {{a night like}} this it always <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a great human being whose pulses you can see heating, beating all the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, my dear, all right," [...] said he meekly. [...] "You know best. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a {{very fine}} home, but of course, if you don't like it we'll look for another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your brother <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a {{man with}} a purpose," [...] she said, as they stood in the entrance-hall on {{their way out of the}} restaurant. [...] "Like a prophet with a mission, perhaps I should say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] said Tripp, almost inaudibly. [...] "I'm sorry you're {{out your}} money. Now, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a find {{of a big}} story, you know-- that is, a {{sort of thing that}} would write up pretty well." ...|$|R
60|$|He stooped {{forward in}} his chair and {{stretched}} out his hand to the man to help him rise. In his altered position the moonlight <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> cast a sort of halo round his face, and it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the face of an angel.|$|R
6000|$|Magdalen {{could not}} help saying, [...] "So you would not learn the Gospel because Dissenters learnt pieces of Scripture! You <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the Roman Catholic child, who said there were five sacraments, {{there ought to be}} seven, but the Protestants had got two of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a whole week, papa, {{since you}} last {{came to see}} me," [...] replied the little one, striving to get at her father's neck again, [...] "and I'm sure it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a hundred years at least." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{it still}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the crying of a woman, And it saddens me much that so piteous a sound On this my bridal night when I would get agone from sorrow [...] Should so ghost-like wander round!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a {{singular}} spectacle," [...] said Maxwell. [...] "The casting {{off of the}} conventional in sea-bathing always <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the effect of those dreams where we appear in society insufficiently dressed, and wonder whether {{we can make it}} go." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{heard him}} leave the house, {{but he did}} not go down the garden. Then, in a few minutes, every one of which <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> an hour, the low voices at the gate ceased and my mother came slowly up the path towards the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was {{a little}} girl--you saw her {{when you were in}} London. She is married now, but I think of her sometimes; and when I do, you and old Jennings <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a couple of blithering idiots cursing things too {{wonderful}} for you to understand!" ...|$|R
60|$|Instead of {{trembling}} {{or looking}} pale, as I {{might have expected}} to see her, Waboose looked {{at me in the}} most composed manner, and with something on her lip that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a smile of amusement. In some confusion, I thanked her for having saved my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "It all <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a {{piece of}} folly, Sergeant Corney, even though because of it are we brought out from the power of our enemies. You can do no more hairbrained things than {{has already been done}} by my son." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The soul,' {{returned}} Ethel. 'Mind {{and body}} may be hurt, {{and it is}} not possible to know one's mind from one's soul while one is alive, but as long as the will and faith are right, to think the soul can be hurt <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> doubting our Protector.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{always makes}} me laugh," [...] he said, [...] "whenever I pass this spot. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> such an awful good joke. Here's that church {{on this side of}} the river, and away over there on the other side of the river is the rector and the congregation." ...|$|E
60|$|FANNY. The excitement! Do {{you know}} what an actress's life always <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like?</b> Dancing on a tight-rope with {{everybody}} throwing stones at you. One soon gets tired {{of that sort of}} excitement. Oh, I was never in love with the stage. Had to do something for a living.|$|R
6000|$|... "I dunno," [...] {{replied the}} driver. [...] "Talked like a furriner, and looked the part. Bushy black beard. Said {{he was a}} German army officer, an' had to beat it back {{on account of the}} war. <b>Seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> he was mighty anxious to get back there an' be killed." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{should have}} knocked, but Ada said perhaps {{we had better}} turn the handle and go in. Thus we came to Richard, poring over a table covered with dusty bundles of papers which <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> dusty mirrors {{reflecting}} his own mind. Wherever I looked I saw the ominous words that ran in it repeated. Jarndyce and Jarndyce.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} I don't know," [...] {{answered}} Edgar. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> an iron or steel box much encrusted with rust, and I shouldn't wonder if it contained something of value. One thing is certain, {{that we have not}} got the key, and must therefore break it open." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a fool business, this {{matching}} folks together," [...] she remarked; [...] "but as we haven't {{anything to}} do till dinner's ready, we may as well {{get rid of some}} of this rubbish. Here, Henry, get busy and look for Larry's bald head. I've got his pink vest, all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can well}} believe it," [...] said Rachel; [...] "even {{some of the}} most {{superior}} persons refuse to lay their hands to any task unless they are certified of the religious opinions of their coadjutors, which <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a mason's refusing to work at a wall with a man who liked Greek architecture when he preferred Gothic!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never dreamed," [...] Margaret declared, as {{she looked}} around her, [...] "that I should ever find myself inside this house. It has always <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> one great bluebeard's chamber. If ever my father spoke of it at all, it was as of a place which he {{intended}} to convert {{into a sort of}} miniature Hell." ...|$|R
60|$|Not that I was vindictive. Not that I {{wanted to}} punish the man. No; I shrank terribly from the task. But to relieve myself from this {{persistent}} sense of surrounding mystery, and to free others from suspicion, I felt compelled to discover him. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a duty laid upon me from without. I dared not shirk it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Ingledew," [...] Frida exclaimed, [...] "do you know, {{when you}} talk like that, I always long to ask you where on earth you come from, and who are these your people you so often speak about. A blessed people: I would like to learn about them; and yet I'm afraid <b>to.</b> You almost <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a being from another planet." ...|$|R
