40|$|SPASTIC colon is a {{functional}} disturbance of the colon, char-acterized by hypertonicity or spasticity of the colon, clinically {{by a variety}} of symptoms including abdom-inal consciousness, abdominal pain, constipation, flatulence, and a tendency toward introspection; while inflamma-tory changes {{may or may not be}} pres-ent. The term <b>spastic</b> <b>colitis</b> has some-times been applied to this entity, but objection has been raised to employing a term that signifies an inflammatory state, since the condition is primarily a disturbance in function, while the inflammatory reaction may occur i...|$|E
40|$|A PERUSAL {{of medical}} {{journals}} today, {{as compared with}} a decade ago, indicates a growing recognition {{of the problems of}} relaxation. Most com-monly it is linked with the discussion of hyperemotional states, noted when the patient is excitable, fatigued or hypochondriac; the need of "calmness and poise " is being stressed in a variety of disorders so wide as to include not only essential hypertension, coronary occlusion, bronchial asthma and neuro-psychiatry states but also <b>spastic</b> <b>colitis</b> and even common forms of con-stipation. 1 Knowledge of the problem of relaxation would seem to be spread wide, but extremely thin, {{in the sense that the}} physiological aspects of this difficult subject receive scant current attention. It is not commonly realized how well defined and also how technical the field has become. Many physicians still think of relaxation in terms of hobbies, sports or warm baths, and they believe that daily rests are the most effective measure available for the re-duction of nervous irritability and fatigue states.

Donnatal is a prescription pharmaceutical, approved in the United States by the FDA, that combines natural belladonna alkaloids in a specific, fixed ratio with phenobarbital to provide peripheral anticholinergic/antispasmodic action and mild sedation. According to its labeling, it is possibly effective for use as adjunctive therapy {{in the treatment of}} irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, <b>spastic</b> colon, mucous <b>colitis)</b> and acute enterocolitis.|$|R
40|$|Although the benzyl esters, benzyl-benzoate, benzyl-acetate, benzyl alcohol, etc., {{were highly}} praised as antispasmodics when first {{introduced}} into medicine, their usefulness as therapeutic agents has fallen {{short of what}} was expected of them. Upon the basis of his results, obtained with experimental animals and from clinical observations, Macht (1) felt that the benzyl esters might be of therapeutic value where there is spastic contraction of smooth muscle as in diarrhea with excessive peristalsis, in dysen-tery, intestinal colic or enterospasm, pylorospasm, mucous <b>colitis,</b> <b>spastic</b> constipation, spastic conditions of the gall bladder and biliary ducts, spasmodic dysmenorrhea, spastic contraction of the seminal vesicles, ureteral colic, vesical spasm, enuresis due to hyperirritable bladder or sphincter, angiospasm and hyper-tension of the circulatory system and bronchospasm (asthma, pertussis, etc.). Much of the work on this subject, for which favorable results are claimed, has been done on clinical cases in which the physical state of the organ studied could not be properly evaluated, and therefore only the subjective findings could be used as the cri-terion in determining the value of the drug.
