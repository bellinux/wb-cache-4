50|$|In case T 307/03, which {{related to}} a pending divisional {{application}} of a granted European patent, three requests were pending. In the main request, the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> 1 corresponded exactly to the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> 3 when dependent on claim 1 of the granted European patent (that is, the patent granted on the parent application). The claim was therefore objected for double patenting and the main request was not allowed into the proceedings. The first auxiliary request was not allowed into the proceedings for essentially the same reasons. Finally, in the second auxiliary request, the subject-matter of the main claim encompassed by the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> 3 of the parent application as granted. This request was also not allowed into the proceedings on the ground of double patenting. The divisional application was therefore refused.|$|E

5000|$|According to Enlarged Board of Appeal {{decision}} G 2/88, [...] "it is {{the totality}} <b>of</b> the <b>claims</b> before amendment {{in comparison with}} the totality <b>of</b> the <b>claims</b> after the proposed amendment that has to be considered". If for instance the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>claims</b> is changed during opposition proceedings to a different embodiment and if, thereby, the scope of protection <b>of</b> the <b>claims</b> has been extended, the amendment, or change, is contrary to Article 123(3) EPC.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the {{critical}} question [...] "What is the same invention?" [...] in , opinion G 2/98 prescribes a photographic approach to the assessment of priority. According to Enlarged Board of Appeal opinion G 2/98, the requirement for <b>claiming</b> priority <b>of</b> [...] "the same invention" [...] means that priority of a previous application in respect <b>of</b> a <b>claim</b> in a European patent application is to be acknowledged only if the skilled person can derive the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>claim</b> directly and unambiguously, using common general knowledge, from the previous application as a whole.|$|R
50|$|The lack {{of unity}} or non-unity (of invention), can appear either a priori, i.e., before {{taking into account the}} prior art, or a posteriori, i.e., after taking into account the prior art. An a posteriori {{lack of unity}} usually results from a lack of novelty or inventive step <b>of</b> the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> one {{independent}} <b>claim.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Under European patent {{practice}} and case law, {{lack of unity}} (of invention) can appear either [...] "a priori", before the prior art was examined, or [...] "a posteriori", after the prior art was examined. An a posteriori lack of unity usually results {{from a lack of}} novelty or inventive step <b>of</b> the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> one independent <b>claim.</b>|$|R

5000|$|On March 8, 2013, the Patent Office {{released}} a practice notice revising policy on examination of [...] "computer-implemented inventions". The practice notice overrides previous {{sections of the}} Manual of Patent Office Practice (MOPOP) relating to [...] "computer-implemented" [...] inventions, including sections related to [...] "examining computer claims."

5000|$|To {{anticipate}} the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> a patent <b>claim,</b> prior art is generally {{expected to provide}} a description sufficient to inform an average worker in the field (or the person skilled in the art) of some subject matter falling within the scope <b>of</b> the <b>claim.</b> Prior art must be available {{in some way to}} the public, and in many countries, the information needs to be recorded in a fixed form somehow. Prior art generally does not include unpublished work or mere conversations (though according to the European Patent Convention, oral disclosures also form prior artâ€”see [...] ). It is disputed whether traditional knowledge (e.g., of medical properties of a certain plant) constitutes prior art.|$|R
5000|$|Funders {{agreed to}} finance {{commercial}} litigation {{in exchange for}} 55% of the proceeds. They agreed to pay the between-the-parties costs if the litigation failed. They also had a prior commercial interest in the litigation because they were already owed money under an agreement which successful litigation {{would enable them to}} recover. The defendants sought a stay of the proceedings on the ground of champerty. Although the Court of Appeal did not have {{to decide whether or not}} the agreement was champertous, it was strongly of the view that it was not, because the alleged disproportion was more theoretical than real, the funders were undertaking a very substantial potential costs liability, they had a pre-existing interest in the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>claim</b> and they would not be able to influence the conduct of the litigation because that, including any negotiations, was in the hands of experienced solicitors 1994 ...|$|R
50|$|The Court {{concluded}} that {{the constitutionality of the}} Connecticut prejudgment attachment procedure must be judged by the balancing test for due process claims described in Mathews v. Eldridge (1976). The Court {{concluded that}} the Connecticut law created too great a risk of erroneous deprivation of property to survive scrutiny under Mathews. In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasized, among other things, that no notice of the proposed attachment was given to the defendant before it was levied; that no pre-attachment hearing was provided, even though the plaintiff's perfunctory verification may provide the judge with little or no insight into the validity of the plaintiff's claim; that there was no requirement that the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>claim</b> be related to the real property being attached; {{and that there was no}} requirement that the plaintiff show special circumstances, such as that the defendant was seeking to evade payment of any judgment that might be awarded. The Court also observed that while an attachment of a defendant's real property did not deprive him or her of the use of the property, it nonetheless represented a significant interference with the defendant's ownership rights.|$|R
