40|$|AbstractDeployable {{high-frequency}} mesh reflector antennas {{for future}} communications and observations {{are required to}} obtain high gain and high directivity. In order to support these new missions, reflectors with high surface accuracy are widely required. The form-finding analysis of deployable mesh reflector antennas becomes more vital which aims to determine the initial surface profile formed by the equilibrium prestress distribution in cables to satisfy the surface accuracy requirement. In this paper, two form-finding methods for mesh reflector antennas, both of which include two steps, are proposed. The {{first step is to}} investigate the prestress design only for the cable net structure as the circumferential nodes connected to the <b>supporting</b> <b>truss</b> are assumed fixed. The second step is to optimize the prestress distribution of the boundary cables connected directly to the <b>supporting</b> <b>truss</b> considering the elastic deformation of the antenna structure. Some numerical examples are carried out and the simulation results demonstrate the proposed form-finding methods can warrant the deformed antenna reflector surface matches the one by design and the cable tension forces fall in a specified range...|$|R

40|$|A system {{study to}} develop the {{definition}} of a structural flight experiment for a large precision segmented reflector on the Space Station was accomplished by the Boeing Aerospace Company for NASA's Langley Research Center. The objective {{of the study was to}} use a Large Deployable Reflector (LDR) baseline configuration as the basis for focusing an experiment definition, so that the resulting accommodation requirements and interface constraints could be used as part of the mission requirements data base for Space Station. The primary objectives of the first experiment are to construct the primary mirror <b>support</b> <b>truss</b> and to determine its structural and thermal characteristics. Addition of an optical bench, thermal shield and primary mirror segments, and alignment of the optical components, would occur on a second experiment.

Support is provided by an 8. 9 -kg (19. 5 -lbm) truss assembly consisting of beryllium tubes adhesively bonded to magnesium end fittings. Beryllium was selected for the tubular struts in the truss because of its exceptionally high stiffness-to-weight ratio. Adhesive bonding, rather than riveting, was utilized to join the struts to the end fittings because of the low toughness (high notch sensitivity) of beryllium. Magnesium, used in the end fittings, resulted in a 50 % weight saving over aluminum since geometric factors in the fitting design resulted in low stress areas where magnesium's lower density is a benefit...|$|E

In addition, similar results are presented for two 20 -meter diameter support trusses. Implications of the analyses for the PSR program are considered and the formulation and limitations of current PSR finite element models are discussed.

40|$|Several issues {{surrounding}} {{the design of}} a large (20 -meter diameter) Precision Segmented Reflector are investigated. The concerns include development of a reflector <b>support</b> <b>truss</b> geometry that will permit deployment into the required doubly-curved shape without significant member strains. For deployable and erectable reflector support trusses, the reduction of structural redundancy was analyzed to achieve reduced weight and complexity for the designs. The stiffness and accuracy of such reduced member trusses, however, were found to be affected to a degree that is unexpected. The Precision Segmented Reflector designs were developed with performance requirements that represent the Reflector application. A novel deployable sunshade concept was developed, and a detailed parametric study of various feed support structural concepts was performed. The results of the detailed study reveal what may be the most desirable feed support structure geometry for Precision Segmented Reflector/Large Deployable Reflector applications...|$|E
