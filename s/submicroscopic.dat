25|$|Virology is {{the study}} of viruses – <b>submicroscopic,</b> {{parasitic}} particles of genetic material contained in a protein coat – and virus-like agents. It focuses on the following aspects of viruses: their structure, classification and evolution, their ways to infect and exploit host cells for reproduction, their interaction with host organism physiology and immunity, the diseases they cause, the techniques to isolate and culture them, and their use in research and therapy. Virology {{is considered to be a}} subfield of microbiology or of medicine.|$|E
25|$|Split hand/foot {{malformation}} (SHFM) {{is characterized}} by underdeveloped or absent central digital rays, clefts of hands and feet, and variable syndactyly of the remaining digits. SHFM is a heterogeneous condition caused by abnormalities at one of multiple loci, including SHFM1 (SHFM1 at 7q21-q22), SHFM2 (Xq26), SHFM3 (FBXW4/DACTYLIN at 10q24), SHFM4 (TP63 at 3q27), and SHFM5 (DLX1 and DLX 2 at 2q31). SHFM3 is unique {{in that it is}} caused by <b>submicroscopic</b> tandem chromosome duplications of FBXW4/DACTYLIN. SHFM3 is considered 'isolated' ectrodactyly and does not show a mutation of the tp63 gene.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{genetic testing}} {{is used for}} more than an initial diagnosis. It is used to confirm {{diagnostic}} testing, for carrier testing females, prenatal diagnosis, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. There are three types of clinical molecular genetic testing. In approximately 85% of males, mis-sense and splice mutations of the NDP gene and partial or whole gene deletions are detected using sequence analysis. Deletion/duplication analysis can be used to detect the 15% of mutations that are <b>submicroscopic</b> deletions. This is also used when testing for carrier females. The last testing used is linkage analysis, which is used when the first two are unavailable. Linkage analysis is also recommended for those families who have more than one member affected by the disease.|$|E
25|$|Atomic orbitals are {{the basic}} {{building}} blocks of the atomic orbital model (alternatively known as the electron cloud or wave mechanics model), a modern framework for visualizing the <b>submicroscopic</b> behavior of electrons in matter. In this model the electron cloud of a multi-electron atom {{may be seen as}} being built up (in approximation) in an electron configuration that is a product of simpler hydrogen-like atomic orbitals. The repeating periodicity of the blocks of 2, 6, 10, and 14 elements within sections of the periodic table arises naturally from the total number of electrons that occupy a complete set of s, p, d and f atomic orbitals, respectively, although for higher values of the quantum number , particularly when the atom in question bears a positive charge, the energies of certain sub-shells become very similar and so the order in which they are said to be populated by electrons (e.g. Cr = 4s13d5 and Cr2+ = 3d4) can only be rationalized somewhat arbitrarily.|$|E
2500|$|In {{trying to}} uncover the {{intermediate}} stages of abiogenesis mentioned by Bernal, Sidney W. Fox in the 1950s and 1960s studied the spontaneous formation of peptide structures (small chains of amino acids) under conditions that might plausibly have existed early in Earth's history. In one of his experiments, he allowed amino acids to dry out as if puddled in a warm, dry spot in prebiotic conditions. He found that, as they dried, the amino acids formed long, often cross-linked, thread-like, <b>submicroscopic</b> polypeptide molecules now named [...] "proteinoid microspheres." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Submicroscopic</b> {{chromosomal}} abnormalities {{that are too}} small to be detected via other means of karyotyping, may be identified by chromosomal microarray analysis. [...] There are several existing microarray techniques that may be utilized during the prenatal diagnosis phase, and these include SNP arrays and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). CGH is a DNA-based diagnostic tool that has been used to detect polysomy 17 in breast cancer. CGH was first used in 1992 by Kallionemi at UC San Francisco. When used in conjunction with ultrasound findings, microarray analysis may be instrumental in the clinical diagnosis of {{chromosomal abnormalities}}.|$|E
2500|$|More {{speculative}} {{ideas have}} focused on bodies altogether different from Earth-like planets. Astronomer Frank Drake, a well-known proponent {{of the search for}} extraterrestrial life, imagined life on a neutron star: <b>submicroscopic</b> [...] "nuclear molecules" [...] combining to form creatures with a life cycle millions of times quicker than Earth life. Called [...] "imaginative and tongue-in-cheek", the idea gave rise to science fiction depictions. Carl Sagan, another optimist with regards to extraterrestrial life, considered the possibility of organisms that are always airborne within the high atmosphere of Jupiter in a 1976 paper. Cohen and Stewart also envisioned life in both a solar environment and in the atmosphere of a gas giant.|$|E
2500|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the random <b>submicroscopic</b> motions and {{vibrations}} of the particle constituents of matter. These motions comprise the internal energy of a substance. More specifically, the thermodynamic temperature of any bulk quantity of matter is the measure of the average kinetic energy per classical (i.e., non-quantum) [...] degree of freedom of its constituent particles. [...] "Translational motions" [...] are almost always in the classical regime. Translational motions are ordinary, whole-body movements in three-dimensional space in which particles move about and exchange energy in collisions. Figure1 below shows translational motion in gases; [...] below shows translational motion in solids. Thermodynamic temperature's null point, absolute zero, is the temperature at which the particle constituents of matter are as close as possible to complete rest; that is, they have [...] motion, retaining only quantum mechanical motion.|$|E
2500|$|Protein {{precipitate}} formation {{occurs in a}} stepwise process. [...] First, a precipitating agent is added and the solution is steadily mixed. [...] Mixing causes the precipitant and protein to collide. Enough mixing time is required for molecules to diffuse across the fluid eddies. [...] Next, proteins undergo a nucleation phase, where <b>submicroscopic</b> sized protein aggregates, or particles, are generated. Growth of these particles is under Brownian diffusion control. Once the particles reach a critical size (0.1 µm to 10 µm for high and low shear fields, respectively), by diffusive addition of individual protein molecules to it, they continue to grow by colliding into each other and sticking or flocculating. This phase occurs at a slower rate. During the final step, called aging in a shear field, the precipitate particles repeatedly collide and stick, then break apart, until a stable mean particle size is reached, which is dependent upon individual proteins. The mechanical strength of the protein particles correlates with {{the product of the}} mean shear rate and the aging time, which is known as the Camp number. Aging helps particles withstand the fluid shear forces encountered in pumps and centrifuge feed zones without reducing in size.|$|E

The chronology protection conjecture should be distinguished from chronological censorship under which every closed timelike curve passes through an event horizon, which might prevent an observer from detecting the causal violation (also known as chronology violation).|$|E
