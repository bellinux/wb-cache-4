5|$|Dodge's {{screenplay}} for Bad Words was {{featured on the}} 2011 Black List and was shortly thereafter picked up by Bateman. In the original script, the story was set at the Scripps National <b>Spelling</b> <b>Bee,</b> but the name was changed to a fictional bee since the filmmakers did not expect Scripps to allow {{the use of their}} name in the film. After two other actors declined to play the main character, Bateman decided to take on the role himself, and cast the other roles by a combination of contacting friends and open casting calls. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the end of 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{developed}} {{over a period}} of 10 years by Atchison, {{who came up with the}} initial concept after seeing the 1994 Scripps National <b>Spelling</b> <b>Bee</b> and noting that a majority of the competitors came from good socioeconomic backgrounds. After completing the script in 1999, Atchison won one of the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting in 2000, which attracted producers Sid Ganis and Nancy Hult Ganis. After an initial inability to secure funding, the project got a second wind as a result of the success of the 2002 documentary film Spellbound. Lionsgate Films undertook the production in 2004 and in the following year it was filmed in South Los Angeles on a budget of over $6 million.|$|E
