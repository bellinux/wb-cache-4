50|$|In 685, John Maron, who {{recognized}} {{the legitimacy of}} Paul the Jew and his <b>successors</b> until Byzantium began to appoint titular Patriarchs of Antioch ending with Theophanes (681-687), was elected Patriarch of Antioch by the Maradite army. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian II sent an army to dislodge John from the see; John and his followers retreated to Lebanon, where they formed the Maronite Church, whose succession of Patriarchs have continued to the present day. The Byzantines appointed Theophanes of Antioch in his stead. Thus there were now three rival patriarchs: those that recognized Severus and his <b>successors,</b> those that recognized John Maron and his <b>successors,</b> and those that recognized Theophanes and his <b>successors.</b> It was the <b>successors</b> of Theophanes who were recognized as legitimate by the Byzantine government.|$|R

5|$|Persecutory {{policies}} {{varied in}} intensity across the empire. Where Galerius and Diocletian were avid persecutors, Constantius was unenthusiastic. Later persecutory edicts, including {{the calls for}} universal sacrifice, were not applied in his domain. His son, Constantine, on taking the imperial office in 306, restored Christians to full legal equality and returned property that had been confiscated during the persecution. In Italy in 306, the usurper Maxentius ousted Maximian's <b>successor</b> Severus, promising full religious toleration. Galerius ended the persecution in the East in 311, but it was resumed in Egypt, Palestine, and Asia Minor by his <b>successor,</b> Maximinus. Constantine and Licinius, Severus's <b>successor,</b> signed the Edict of Milan in 313, which offered a more comprehensive acceptance of Christianity than Galerius's edict had provided. Licinius ousted Maximinus in 313, bringing an end to persecution in the East.|$|E
