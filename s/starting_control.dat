40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} new {{technique}} for approximate dynamic programming that is suitable for control of large-scale systems with complex dynamics. The approach improves closed-loop performances from a <b>starting</b> <b>control</b> policy by incrementally updating a value function on-line based on the Bellman’s optimality equation. The value function is approximated as a map {{between the state and}} the associated cost-to-go value to circumvent the “curse-of-dimensionality. ” The approximation method uses piecewise quadratic representations of the value function, and can considerably reduce the computational requirement compared to the instance-based methods, which store all the historical data and retrieve them for calculating optimal control actions. Hybrid and nonlinear examples are included to demonstrate the applicability of the approach. 1...|$|E
40|$|A new {{implicit}} dual {{technique is}} presented for stochastic adaptive control synthesis. In this technique, denoted as {{the method of}} utility costs (MOUC), a new control policy is derived from a known <b>starting</b> <b>control</b> policy by using a single iteration in time-varying policy space. An important {{result is that the}} new control policy yields a corresponding improvement in adaptive performance relative to the known starting policy. Since the starting policy can be chosen arbitrarily, the new policy has potentially superior performance relative to any existing design. Unlike other implicit dual designs, the MOUC can be applied to systems having constrained inputs, discontinuities, discrete valued disturbances, as well as in situations where the variances of the associated process statistics are large. A numerical example is given in which a controller is synthesized to provide improved performance relative to the Open-Loop Feedback policy of Dreyfus...|$|E

The present paper mainly focuses on the fuel injection quantity control based on the engine power demand especially the acceleration demand for the resistance force is fixed for a specific engine, and the starting acceleration velocity is set as a target curve so that the acceleration process can also be fixed. The feasibility of the start control strategy proposed in this paper was verified by a comparison of the traditional <b>starting</b> <b>control</b> with a constant fuel quantity, and starting performance of the target acceleration based control shows predominance to the constant quantity control.

40|$|A key {{component}} of some volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) optimization algorithms is the progressive addition of control points to the optimization. This idea was introduced in Otto's seminal VMAT paper, in which a coarse sampling of control points was used {{at the beginning of}} the optimization and new control points were progressively added one at a time. A different form of the methodology is also present in the RapidArc optimizer, which adds new control points in groups called 'multiresolution levels', each doubling the number of control points in the optimization. This progressive sampling accelerates convergence, improving the results obtained, and has similarities with the ordered subset algorithm used to accelerate iterative image reconstruction. In this work we have used a VMAT optimizer developed in-house to study the performance of optimization algorithms which use different control point sampling sequences, most of which fall into three different classes: doubling sequences, which add new control points in groups such that the number of control points in the optimization is (roughly) doubled; Otto-like progressive sampling which adds one control point at a time, and equi-length sequences which contain several multiresolution levels each with the same number of control points. Results are presented in this study for two clinical geometries, prostate and head-and-neck treatments. A dependence of the quality of the final solution on the number of <b>starting</b> <b>control</b> points has been observed, in agreement with previous works. We have found that some sequences, especially E 20 and E 30 (equi-length sequences with 20 and 30 multiresolution levels, respectively), generate better results than a 5 multiresolution level RapidArc-like sequence. The final value of the cost function is reduced up to 20 %, such reductions leading to small improvements in dosimetric parameters characterizing the treatments-slightly more homogeneous target doses and better sparing of the organs at risk...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the efficiency of}} blood flow autoregulation of the hind-limb vascular bed of eleven conscious dogs during: resting conditions; graded levels of treadmill exercise; and increases in oxygen consumption produced by the administration of 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (DNP). Blood flow to the left hind limb was measured with an electromagnetic flow probe on the left external iliac artery. Hind-limb perfusion pressure was measured from a catheter in the deep femoral artery and was controlled via an externally inflatable occlusion cuff positioned just distal to the flow probe. Arterial pressure was measured in the abdominal aorta. Experiments were performed 5 - 16 days after instrumentation. Hind-limb pressure-flow (P-F) relationships were evaluated by decreasing hind-limb perfusion pressure in 4 - 5 small sequential 'square-wave' steps of 10 - 15 mmHg each while measuring flow. Each step decrease in perfusion pressure was maintained for 2 min. The efficiency of autoregulation was quantified by calculating the closed-loop gain of flow regulation (Gc) at each decrement in perfusion pressure utilizing the equation: Gc = 1 -[(F 0 -Fn/F 0) /(P 0 -Pn/P 0) ] where F 0 and P 0 are the <b>starting</b> (<b>control)</b> flows and pressures prevailing prior to decreasing perfusion pressure, and Fn and Pn are the new flows and pressures at each decrement in perfusion pressure. A Gc value less than 0 indicates a predominantly passive P-F relationship, while a Gc of 1 is perfect autoregulation of flow. When the dogs were at rest, decrements in hind-limb perfusion pressure were accompanied by almost equivalent decreases in flow, i. e. no autoregulation occurred, and Gc averaged - 0. 177 +/- 0. 044 over the pressure range from 100 - 40 mmHg. During all levels of treadmill exercise (on gradients of 0, 7, or 21 %), however, positive Gc values were found that averaged from 0. 258 +/- 0. 046 at a gradient of 0 % to 0. 392 +/- 0. 041 at a gradient of 21 % and were significantly different from Gc values found during rest at perfusion pressure ranges from 90 - 40 mmHg. The administration of DNP directly into the hind-limb circulation increased hind-limb blood flow from 199 to 481 ml/min. In the presence of DNP, Gc values were positive over perfusion pressure ranges from 100 - 40 mmHg and averaged 0. 473 +/- 0. 054. These data demonstrate that hind-limb blood flow is not autoregulated in resting dogs, but that significant autoregulation is manifest during conditions that increase oxygen consumption.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the online optimal control strategies for multiple-chiller plants in large buildings with enhanced robustness and cost efficiency, including optimization of chilled water supply temperature set-point, chiller sequencing <b>control,</b> optimal <b>start</b> <b>control</b> and electrical demand limiting control. The chilled water supply temperature set-point optimization aims {{to minimize the}} total energy consumption of chillers and chilled water distribution pumps. In the chiller sequencing control, three schemes are used to enhance its control robustness, including a data fusion scheme for improved reliability of building cooling load measurement, a simplified adaptive model of maximum chiller cooling capacity, and an online sensor fault detection and diagnosis(FDD). In the chiller optimal <b>start</b> <b>control,</b> a model-based strategy is proposed for minimizing the energy consumption in the morning start period. The model-based optimal <b>start</b> <b>control</b> strategy considers both the recovery ability and the pre-cooling lead time as its optimizing variables. The peak demand limiting control strategy minimizes the monthly electricity bill by predicting a suitable monthly peak demand threshold and restraining the daily peak demand to the threshold. These control strategies are validated using the dynamic simulation of the central chiller plant in a high-rising building in Hong Kong. © All Rights Reserved...|$|R
