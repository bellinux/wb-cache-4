KEYWORDS and PHRASES Stacked bit sliced architectures, folding, area + Research supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation under grant MIP 86 - 17374. 2 1. Introduction A <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>bit</b> sliced components ([LARM 90] and [WU 90]) consists of n components of varying height and width with their left ends vertically aligned as in Figure 1 (a). The intra component (i. e., inter slice but local to a component) routing is done on metal layer 1 while the inter component (i. e., intra slice but across components) routing is done on metal layer 2. A component stack may be folded at component i 1 by rotating components i 1 + 1, [...] ., i n by 180 ° so that their aligned ends {{are now on the}} right and the component order is i 1 + 1, [...] ., i [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Wide and disjointed, {{blending}} {{a fractured}} pulse with dynamic texture, {{this is an}} immersive and disorientating music, sometimes subtle, often invasive, always close. In capturing a moment and inscribing agency, the motionblur of the cover art offers a suitable metaphor for this duo’s musical interactions. Live sampled source sounds are gesturally manipulated and reworked within open ended narratives, sounding like an air whistle blasting out from an old steam locomotive as it emerges at speed from a tunnel. Whilst the whistle pig/groundhog (day) reference explores cycles of repetition beyond episodic improvisation, emphasising the value of revisiting and re-appropriating a previous moment. John configures the electric guitar as a site for multiple simultaneous points of interaction and queries the iconic cultural status of his instrument via feet, fingers and feedback.

50|$|The CPU {{architecture}} featured three register sets. The Nest was a 16-deep pushdown <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> arithmetic registers, The SJNS (Subroutine Jump Nesting Store) was {{a similar}} <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> return addresses. The Q Store {{was a set}} of 16 index registers, each <b>of</b> 48 <b>bits</b> divided into Counter (C), Increment (I) and Modifier (M) parts <b>of</b> 16 <b>bits</b> each. Flags on a memory-reference instruction specified whether the address should be modified by the M part of a Q Store, and, if so, whether the C part should be decremented by 1 and the M part incremented by {{the contents of the}} I part. This made the coding of counting loops very efficient. Three additional Nest levels and one additional SJNS level were reserved to Director, the Operating System, allowing short-path interrupts to be handled without explicit register saving and restoring. As a result the interrupt overhead was only 3 clock cycles.|$|R

40|$|Many {{applications}} of ReBCO coated conductors contain <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> pancake coils. In {{order to reduce}} their high AC loss, {{it is necessary to}} understand the loss mechanisms. In this article, we measure and simulate the AC loss and the critical current, I_c, in <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> pancake coils ("pancakes"). We construct <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> up to 4 pancakes and we measure them by electrical means. We also obtain the anisotropic field dependence of J_c from I_c measurements of the tape. This J_c is the only input to the simulations, together with the coil dimensions. After validating our computations with the measurements, we simulate <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> many pancakes, up to 32. We found that the AC loss in a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> (four) pancakes is very high, two orders of magnitude larger than for a single tape. A double pancake behaves as a single one with double width but a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> more pancakes is very different. Finally, we found that a 2 -strand Roebel cable reduces the AC loss in a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> pancakes but not in a single pancake. In conclusion, the AC loss in <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> pancakes is too high. However, our simulations are useful to predict the AC loss and optimise the coil design, reducing the AC loss.
