40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the interaction of a source-sink pair. The main parameters of the problem are source and sink flow rates, the axial and lateral separations of the source and sink, and the angle between the axes of source and sink. Of concern is the percentage of source fluid that enters the sink as a function of these parameters. The experiments have been carried using the source nozzle diameter of 6 mm and the <b>sink</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter of two sizes: 10 mm and 20 mm. The Reynolds numbers of the source jet is about 3200. The main diagnostics are flow visualization using dye, laser induced fluorescence (LIF), particle streak photographs and particle image velocimetry (Ply). To obtain the removal effectiveness (that is percentage of source fluid that is going through the <b>sink</b> <b>pipe),</b> titration method is used. The sink diameter and the angle between source and the sink axes do not influence efficiencies as do the sink flow rate and the lateral separation. Data from experiments have been consolidated so that these results can be used for designing sinks for removal of heat and pollutants. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the removal of unwanted fluid through the source-sink pair. The source consists of fluid issuing out of a nozzle {{in the form of a}} jet and the sink is a pipe that is kept some distance from the source pipe. Of concern is the percentage of source fluid sucked through the sink. The experiments have been carried in a large glass water tank. The source nozzle diameter is 6 Â mm and the <b>sink</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter is either 10 or 20 Â mm.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the study of a {{submerged}} jet for the suction of unwanted fluid. This submerged jet {{is caused by the}} fluid coming out from a source. The presence of a sink in front of this source facilitates the suction of the fluid depending upon the source and sink flow rates, the axial and lateral separations of the source and sink, and the angle between the axes of the source and sink. The main purpose is the determination of the sink flow rate for 100 % removal of the source fluid as a function of these parameters. The experiments have been carried using a source nozzle 6 mm in diameter and two sizes for the <b>sink</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter: 10 mm and 20 mm. The main diagnostics used are flow visualization using dye and particle image velocimetry (PIV). The dependence of the required suction flow rate to obtain 100 % effectiveness on the suction tube diameter and angle is relatively weak compared to the lateral separation.

40|$|The present work {{consists}} of two parts: experimental study of natural ventilation in a model room and the flow associated with a source-sink pair. The first part describes the natural ventilation of a model room of size 300 mmx 300 mm x 300 mm with water as the fluid medium. It is insulated by air gaps on the four sides and at the top. A constant heat flux of 3148 W/m 2 has been maintained on the bottom surface of the room. This ‘room’ {{is surrounded by a}} large exterior tank containing water. The changes in temperature of the bottom, the interior and the exterior have been measured using T-type thermocouples. There are three openings each on two opposing sides of the model room. For any experiment, only one opening on each side is kept open. Fluid enters or leaves these openings and the flow is driven entirely by buoyancy forces. Three configurations have been studied: (1) The bottom opening at the inlet side and the top opening at the outlet side are open, (2) the bottom opening at the inlet side and the middle opening at the outlet side are open, and (3) the middle opening at the inlet side and the top opening at the outlet side are open. Shadowgraph technique is used for visualization. The buoyancy causes flow to enter through the bottom opening and leave through the top opening. At the openings, buoyant jets are observed and which have higher or lower relative densities. The buoyant jet at the inlet interacts with the plumes on the heated bottom plate. From these visualizations, it appears that free convection at bottom plate will be affected by the buoyant jets at the openings {{and the degree to which}} it is affected depends on the position and size of openings and distance between inlet and outlet. The flow rate due to the natural ventilation depends on the bottom surface heat flux and the height difference between the openings. The temperatures of the ﬂoor, the interior and the exterior are calculated using a simple mathematical model (Hunt and Linden [1999]). The mathematical model assumes well mixed conditions within the room and accounts for losses at the openings. The values of temperatures obtained in the experiments are reasonably well predicted by the mathematical model. The second part of the work is concerned with the interaction of a source -sink pair. The source {{consists of}} fluid issuing out of a nozzle in the form of a jet and the sink is a pipe that is kept some distance from the source pipe. Such source -sink pairs are observed in many situations including data centers, and collection of fresh water from a large reservoir that has also a discharge of pollutants. The main parameters of the problem are source and sink flow rates, the axial and lateral separations of the source and sink, and the angle between the axes of source and sink. Of concern is the percentage of source ﬂuid that enters the sink as a function of these parameters. The experiments have been carried in a large glass water tank. The source nozzle diameter is 6 mm and the <b>sink</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter is either 10 mm or 20 mm. The horizontal and vertical separations and angles between these source and sink pipes are adjustable. The Reynolds numbers of the source jet is about 3200. Experiments were done with the sink flow rate equal to, lower or higher than the source flow rate. The flow was visualized using KMnO 4 dye and planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF). The velocity fields for some cases were obtained using Particle Image Velocitymetry (PIV). To obtain the efficiency (that is percentage of source fluid entering the <b>sink</b> <b>pipe),</b> titration method is used. A small amount of hydrochloric acid (HCL) is added in the jet fluid through the overhead tank and the fluid collected at the sink is titrated with the Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as base and Phenolphthalein as the pH indicator. The main characteristics of the jet, without a sink, were measured using PIV. The velocity profiles, jet widths and volume flow rates at various axial locations were obtained and compared with results reported in the literature for similar Reynolds number jets. For 100 %, 70 %, 50 % and 25 % efficiencies or removals and for zero lateral separations, the sink flow rate is about 1. 5 times the flow rate predicted on the basis of jet properties at that point in the absence of a sink. The sink flow rate to obtain a certain efficiency increase dramatically with lateral separation; for example, when the lateral separation is about one half jet width, the required sink flow rate to obtain a certain efficiency increases by about five times. The sink diameter and the angle between source and the sink axes don’t influence efficiencies as much as the lateral separation. Data from our all experiments have been consolidated in the form of correlations that can be used for design of appropriate sinks for removal of heat and pollutants...|$|E

This type of embedded heat <b>pipes</b> heat <b>sink</b> module successively transfer heat from a heat source to the heat <b>pipes,</b> the heat <b>sink</b> and their surroundings, and are suitable for cooling electronic systems via forced convection mechanism.

40|$|Heat {{conduction}} {{plays an}} important role in the efficiency and life span of electronic components. To keep electronic components running efficiently and at a proper temperature, thermal management systems transfer heat generated from the components to thermal surfaces such as heat <b>sinks,</b> heat <b>pipes,</b> radiators, or heat spreaders. Thermal surfaces absorb the heat from the electrical components and dissipate it into the environment, preventing overheating. To ensure the best contact between electrical components and thermal surfaces, thermal interface materials are applied. In addition to having high conductivity, ideal thermal interface materials should be compliant to conform to the components, increasing the surface contact. While many different types of interface materials exist for varying purposes, Energy Science Laboratories, Inc. (ESLI), of San Diego, California, proposed using carbon velvets as thermal interface materials for general aerospace and electronics applications. NASA s Johnson Space Center granted ESLI a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract to develop thermal interface materials that are lightweight and compliant, and demonstrate high thermal conductance even for nonflat surfaces.

50|$|After Rozendahl's {{account was}} {{rejected}} by the magazine, Ruckman chose to adapt the story into a book, noting that no children's books about tornadoes had existed at the time. When Ruckman began to research the events of the outbreak in May 1982, when preparing to write the book (at which time, most areas of the city that were destroyed by the tornadoes were already rebuilt), the Rozendal family recalled to her stories of how they survived the tornado and other personal accounts in its aftermath. The book incorporates events occurring to the Rozendahls in the book; among them, Florence - like Linda Hatch - had been sewing a dress at her kitchen table, as her children repeatedly asked {{if they were going to}} shelter in the basement as the weather worsened; as experienced by Danny and Arthur before the tornado hit the Hatch home, the Rozendahls heard sucking noises emanating from their <b>sink</b> and <b>pipe</b> drains, with the family taking cover in the basement shower (where Danny, Arthur and Ryan sheltered).

40|$|Abstract: An {{experimental}} study is performed {{in this paper}} to verify the concept of thermal management of using a heat pipe in the drilling process. The basic idea is to insert a heat pipe {{at the center of}} the drill tool with the evaporator located close to the drill tip, and condenser located at the end of the drill. In this way, heat accumulated in the drill tip can be transported to the remote section of the drill and remove it there to the tool holder, which attaches the drill. Temperatures at the drill tip as well as tool wear can be reduced significantly. In this paper, experimental investigations on a heat pipe drill for various heat flux inputs, inclination angles and rotating speeds are presented. The effect of contact resistance and tool holder (acting as heat <b>sink)</b> on heat <b>pipe</b> performance will also be demonstrated. The results presented in this paper may be used for important design and practical implementation consideration...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} {{outlines}} {{the advantages of}} using trenchless methods for the rehabilitation of pipelines made of steel, concrete, cast iron etc. The authors describe causes of carrier pipe ageing and methods of their inspection and renovation. The technical aspects of choosing the renovation methods are also presented. The paper includes a decision-making flowchart for choosing the carrier pipes renovations. Design/methodology/approach: The 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s saw an explosion of new pipe installation and repair techniques which minimize the need to dig continuous trenches to bury the pipeline, so called ‘trenchless technologies’. The trenchless technologies have been widely applied for the rehabilitation of various pipelines such as sewage systems, gas pipelines or water supply systems. There has been characterized the swagelining technology {{which is based on}} one of the metal working technologies and namely the <b>sinking</b> of <b>pipes.</b> Findings: The PE pipe stress in the drawing die zone has been analyzed and an attempt has been made to analyze the mechanisms causing the elastic recovery of PE pipes. There have also been presented the diameter changes as the parameter of the elastic recovery which is a result of our own research conducted in accordance with the program developed. Research limitations/implications: Each pipeline renovation method has its advantages and disadvantages, possibilities and limitations, depending on the application. Practical implications: The work is an example of analysis of chosen trenchless renovation on the example of swageling technology. Originality/value: The trenchless renovation of pipelines certainly will be more readily used in the future because of wearing out of pipelines. The other reason is the lack of space for new utilities, increasing costs and road-surface restoration requirements...|$|R
