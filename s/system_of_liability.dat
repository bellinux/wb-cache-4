5000|$|Since 1978, Canadian {{criminal}} law has recognized {{a distinction between}} offenses of [...] "strict" [...] and [...] "absolute" [...] liability. In R. v. City of Sault Ste-Marie the Supreme Court of Canada created a two-tiered <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> for regulatory offenses. Under this system, the Crown {{would continue to be}} relieved from proving the mens rea of the offense. However, offenses of strict liability would grant the accused a defense of due diligencewhich would continue to be denied in cases of absolute liability. Further, {{in the absence of a}} clear legislative intent to the contrary, the Court held that all regulatory offences would be presumed to bear strict liability.|$|E
50|$|Obligations did not {{originally}} {{form part}} of Roman Law, which mostly concerned issues of succession, property, and family relationships. It developed {{as a solution to}} a gap in the system, when one party committed a wrong against another party. These situations were originally governed by a basic customary law of revenge. This undesirable situation eventually developed into a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> where people were at first encouraged and then essentially forced to accept monetary compensation from the wrongdoer or their family instead of seeking vengeance. This signaled an important shift in the law away from vengeance and towards compensation. The state supported this effort by standardizing amounts for certain wrongs. Thus the earliest form of Obligation law derives out of what we would today call Delict.|$|E

The problems I have are more with the conclusions toward which Professor McKean tends.

40|$|The {{legal concept}} and the doctrinal theory of state {{responsibility}} and liability {{have been in the}} focus of public international law for a long while.

50|$|Administrative {{liability}} in English law {{is an area}} of law concerning the tortious liability of public bodies in English law. The existence of private law tort applying to public bodies is a result of Diceyan constitutional theory suggesting that it would be unfair if a separate <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> existing for government and officials. Therefore a public body which acts ultra vires is liable in tort is a cause of action can be established just like any individual would be. An ultra vires action will not, per se, give rise to damages Therefore a claimant will have to fit into one of the recognised private law courses of action. These areas in which a public body can incur private {{liability in}} tort were described by Lord Browne Wilkinson in X and others (minors) v Bedfordshire County Council 1995 3 All ER 353 (HL).|$|E
5000|$|The United States Supreme Court first {{articulated}} {{the basis for}} excluding false statements of fact from First Amendment protection in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974). In that case, a monthly newspaper was sued by a policeman's attorney. The newspaper [...] "contained serious inaccuracies" [...] about the attorney; namely, that he was supporting the police system as a goal to entrench a Communist conspiracy in the United States. They held that a civil jury award against the newspaper was constitutional because [...] "there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact". Justice Powell, in writing {{the decision of the}} Court reasoned that false statements do not [...] "advance society's interest in 'uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate'".

40|$|This comment will {{demonstrate}} how discrepancies among product li- ability standards and different interpretations of their application have cre- ated fear and {{uncertainty in the}} pharmaceutical industry. This fear has caused distortions in the market, increased costs for both manufacturers and consumers, and chilled {{the research and development}} of new products. To combat these problems, this comment proposes that the United States, the European Union, and Japan work together to create a new international, uniform <b>system</b> <b>of</b> product <b>liability</b> for pharmaceutical products. Harmo- nizing the standard <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> for pharmaceuticals among these regimes has proven inadequate to stop inconsistency and uncertainty. This comment proposes the creation of an International Drug Administration (IDA), com- prised of members from different countries that would serve as an interna- tional regulatory agency promulgating registration and development requirements for new drugs on the international market. A special subset of the IDA would serve as an administrative tribunal for liability cases. The IDA tribunal would provide a uniform <b>system</b> <b>of</b> product <b>liability,</b> compen- sating consumers for injury but not punishing manufacturers without fault. Part II of this comment will introduce the current liability standards for pharmaceutical products in the United States, the European Union, and Ja- pan, and will explain how these standards developed and how they differ from each other. Part I will then illustrate how these differences translate into uncertainty and how that uncertainty negatively affects the pharmaceu- tical market. Part IV will introduce the concept of international regulation of the pharmaceutical industry through an IDA.

40|$|This paper navigates {{through the}} civil {{liability}} legal theory in studying its economic effects. It aims at giving an insight of the Islamic <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability.</b> To do so, {{it begins with}} a brief introduction of what a liability system is through a glance at the experience of the United States in this regard. The American <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> gives the courts a wide range of authority to assess the injury, which includes material, emotional, and loss of future income opportunity, and compensation that aims at not only granting the injured a recuperating sum, but also at deterring the injurer from such a behavior. The most serious economic outcome of the A system are: the grandiose uncertainty and unpredictability, and the huge amount of grants that represents high cost, and sometimes prohibitive, of liability. This led to long and cumbersome litigation, consumer profiteering, forsake of innovative ideas, and shortage of certain products and services. The Islamic <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> centers on the materiality of the injury, both in its causality and in its outcome, and it provides a list of compensations. Accordingly, recognizable emotional harm is only the one that can actually be materially checked, and recognizable loss of income covers only that actually forgone income during the off work period caused by the injury. As life and parts of the human body are sacred and priceless, the I system leaves it only to revelation to define the amount of compensation for loss of life and bodily parts. The main economic outcome of the I system is its predictability and conservative amounts of compensation. The system also assigns a role for the society both in payment of the grant and in benefiting from the compensation. Civil liability, Tort, Islamic tort and Islamic liability...|$|E

The main aim is to show why this concept needs to be different from the one we know from civil law. The legal relationship between the State and an individual is a relationship that differs from the one we know from civil law, given that it is related to the exercise of power. Therefore we have to construct specific legal conditions in order to find the State liable for damages that an individual may suffer in such a relationship. In the first part I question the main function <b>of</b> the State's <b>liability</b> for damages.
