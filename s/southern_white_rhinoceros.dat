40|$|Breeding {{performance}} in captive <b>southern</b> <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> is disappointing. The same {{applies to the}} two female <b>southern</b> <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> in the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand. Since these females have never produced offspring, the reproductive status is examined in this study. With the use of non-invasive monitoring, by measuring fecal progesterone and by observing behavior related to the estrous, one could make some assumptions about their reproductive cyclicity. The peaks and nadirs in the progesterone profiles, indicate that both females are cyclic, with cycle lengths of respectively 30, 5 days and 36 days. Furthermore, both females showed mating behavior, which occurred on the day progesterone concentrations were at a nadir (taking in account the gastrointestinal transit time), underlining {{that they were in}} estrous. However, the timespan of this study and the regularity of sample collection were not sufficient to draw firm conclusions. A long-term study with a more regular sample collection would give more comprehensive hormone profiles. Simultaneously performing ultrasonographic examination would provide valuable data to gain more knowledge about the failure in reproducing of the two female <b>southern</b> <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses...</b>|$|R

40|$|Reproduction rate in captive <b>southern</b> <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> is astonishingly low and {{the reason}} for this remains unclear. In this study fecal {{corticoid}} and progesterone profiles were obtained of two female <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> living in the Khao Kheow Open Zoo, Thailand, that never produced offspring. Goal was to study the relationship between stress and fertility. Mean fecal corticoid concentrations were 36. 2 ng/g and 37. 9 ng/g, corticoid variability was 29. 1 and 30. 9. There was no strong correlation between fecal cortisol and progesterone concentrations (r= 0. 4). The progesterone profiles were not indicative of acyclicity, suggesting cortisol does not inhibit cyclicity in these animals. Average cycle length based on behavioral observation was 26 days, with no obvious irregularity observed. However, the period of sample taking is too short to draw conclusions about regularity of cycle length. To determine whether cortisol prevents successful pregnancy, further research is necessary, including ultrasonography and long-term hormonal profiles...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>southern</b> <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> are {{the most}} {{numerous}} of the five rhinoceros species in the world, their population is declining and their status is near threatened. Since breeding {{is an important component}} in rhinoceros conservation, knowledge about the oestrus cycle should be available. The aim {{of this study was to}} get insight in the oestrus cycle of six free ranging <b>southern</b> <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> in the Lapalala Wilderness, South Africa by measurement of faecal progestagene metabolites. This study, with duration of 3. 5 months, is part of a long term study of IBREAM (Institute for Breeding Rare and Endangered African Mammals), Utrecht University and the University of Pretoria. Faecal samples were collected (from each animal 2 - 3 times a week) and progestagene measurements were conducted with an Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA). Luteal activity was detected in five out of six monitored rhinoceroses. Four rhinoceroses (Munyani, Mokibelo, Radimpe and Grikie) all showed different hormone profiles. Two animals showed a luteal phase: Munyani showed an oestrus cycle of around 68 days, Mokibelo also showed a luteal phase, but the length was undefined. The other two animals (Radimpe and Grikie) did not show any luteal phase in these 3. 5 months. The profiles of the other two animals (Tharo and Mohklaki) were not analysed further due to low sample numbers. A second aspect of this study was to visualize the degradation of progestagene metabolite concentrations in faecal samples over time. Samples for the degradation study were collected at 0, 0. 15, 0. 30, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 hours after defecation from five different rhinoceroses. The study showed no significant effect of time on progestagene concentrations (F(8, 32) = 1. 48; p = 0. 202). It can be concluded from this study that progestagene concentrations are not influenced by degradation in time from 0 - 32 hours after defecation...|$|R
40|$|Gaining {{knowledge}} of the reproductive status of wild animals can provide invaluable information that may assist in making appropriate conservation management programs. This study {{was a part of}} a long term non-invasive reproductive study in wild <b>southern</b> <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> (Ceratotherium simum simum) females in the Lapalala Wilderness in South Africa. Six females were monitored non-invasively using fecal progestagen analysis during a 4 months period. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the oestrus cycle of wild female <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> and to non-invasively determine pregnancy. Fresh fecal samples were attempted to be collected on a regular basis (ideally twice per week) from each of the six females. The samples were freeze-dried and extracted and an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was performed. The fecal progestagen profiles were highly variable between the different females. Because of the difficulty of finding the rhinoceroses on a regular basis it proved to be difficult to determine the oestrus cycles of these females. However, the progestagen profiles showed a significant difference between pregnant and non-pregnant periods. Non-invasive measurement of progestagen levels could therefore be implicated in wildlife management for determining pregnancy in wild female <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses...</b>|$|R
50|$|During the Shang dynasty {{the range}} of the {{rhinoceros}} may have reached as far north in Inner Mongolia as the territory of the Shang kings, in the Yellow River valley, but over time its range was reduced, and by the Han Dynasty it was no longer present in northern China, north of the Yangtze River and in Zhongyuan. It was thought the colder climate of northeast Asia caused habitat loss for the rhinoceroses. By the Tang Dynasty (618-907) it was only found in an area south of the Yangtze River, such as in the modern southern provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi and Yunnan. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), it was revealed that the demand for rhino horn caused the extinction of rhinoceros in central to northern China. One of the last outposts of the native Chinese rhinoceros was Sichuan, where rhinoceroses were reported to be living up to the late 17th century. The last native population of rhinoceros only became extinct in Yunnan province in the 20th century, although a small population of <b>Southern</b> <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> (native to South Africa) were introduced in 2003.|$|R

40|$|Modern captive animal institutes (zoos) {{focus on}} conservation, entertainment, education, {{research}} and {{the welfare of the}} animals. A good indicator that there could be underlying welfare issues, caused by physical or managerial inadequacies for example, is the display of stereotypic behaviour. Stereotypic behaviour refers to repetitive or abnormal actions, such as pacing or self-mutilation. In this study, I firstly examined the prevalence of stereotypies in captive mammals, and associated risk factors, in three New Zealand zoos (in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington) using a questionnaire to examine staff perceptions and attitudes towards stereotypical behaviour and its mitigation. Secondly, I observed behaviours of eight species (African wild dogs [AWDs], chimpanzees, giraffes, meerkats, otters, <b>southern</b> <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses,</b> tigers, and zebras) housed at the three institutes to document the occurrence of stereotypical behaviour. Thirdly, I investigated the efficacy of short-term enrichment on three target species (chimpanzees, giraffes, AWDs) that displayed stereotypies. At each institute, zoo staff recognised the occurrence of stereotypic behaviour and they agreed that such behaviour indicates underlying welfare issues. My observations confirmed that stereotypical behaviour did occur at each institute, with six of the eight species displaying stereotypies including pacing, licking inedible objects, begging, circling, head shaking/tossing, hair picking, body rocking, and coprophagy. Neither meerkats nor rhinos displayed stereotypies, however, indicating that these species may be better suited to captivity than the others. The enrichment program I developed for three species (AWDs, giraffes, and chimpanzees) was partly successful in that the animals engaged with the range of toys and devices provided, but the frequency of stereotypies was not reduced. Consequently, enrichment alone cannot be used to treat stereotypical behaviour. My findings are important for helping to improve the welfare of captive zoo mammals...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the {{reproductive}} biology of wild animals can provide valuable {{information for the}} development of appropriate in situ and ex situ management plans. The present study aimed to establish a non-invasive protocol for monitoring faecal progestagen metabolite (FPM) patterns in wild female <b>southern</b> <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> (Ceratotherium simum simum). Six adult females at Lapalala Wilderness, South Africa, were tracked and accurately identified at least once every week. Three animals gave birth during the study period. Fresh faecal samples were collected for 12 months and stored frozen at – 20 °C until analysis with an enzyme immunoassay utilizing an antiserum raised against 5 -pregnan- 3 -ol- 20 -one which cross-reacts with a number of progestagens. Mean FPM concentrations were 35 to 64 -fold higher during pregnancy (55 – 145 days before parturition) compared to postpartum (120 – 140 days after parturition) (P < 0. 001). Also, the non-pregnant animals had mean FPM concentrations significantly higher than postpartum values (P = 0. 006). Our results show that non-invasive FPM measurements provide information on the pregnancy status of wild female <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses,</b> and may be used for the detection of pregnancy in free-living individuals, without the necessity of immobilization and/or relocation of the animal. This information has potential value for optimizing breeding management of wild and captive populations.
