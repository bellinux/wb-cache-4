5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown was {{developed}} by Guildford-based video game studio Criterion Games. The studio suffered several setbacks during {{the sequence of events}} that led up to the creation of Burnout 3, including the cancellation of a project, a failed pitch, and a fall out with the game's eventual publisher Electronic Arts (EA). In 2002, Criterion was around 130 people divided into two development teams. One team was working on Burnout 2: Point of Impact, a follow up to Burnout, set to be published by Acclaim Entertainment. The other team had completed the development of the extreme sports game AirBlade for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony had intentions of continuing to collaborate with Criterion on a sequel to AirBlade, however the AirBlade team turned down the offer. Instead, Criterion began talks with EA, who had a proposal for Criterion to create a remake of the 1988 skateboarding video game Skate or Die!. Criterion were keen to work with EA and started development on the project. Following Burnout 2s release, Criterion prepared a pitch to EA Canada about working on a second game with the publisher. Criterion's proposed title was Need For Speed: <b>Split</b> <b>Second,</b> a stunt racing game within EA's Need for Speed series. Meanwhile, the Skate of Die! remake project was thrown into disarray when EA requested changes to the game's design and the creative direction of project shifted away from Criterion's vision. With development staff becoming unhappy and stressed about the project, the studio decided to contact EA and cancel the game. EA was displeased with their decision and {{the relationship between the two}} companies soured, leading to dissolution of the proposed Need for Speed game.|$|E

25|$|As flight speed {{increases}} supersonically {{the shock}} system is initially external. For the SR-71 this was until about M1.6 to M1.8 and M2 for the XB-70. The intake {{is said to}} be unstarted. Further increase in speed produces supersonic speeds inside the duct with a plane shock near the throat. The intake {{is said to be}} started. Upstream or downstream disturbances, such as gusts/atmospheric temperature gradients and engine airflow changes, both intentional and unintentional(from surging), tend to cause the shock to be expelled almost instantaneously. Expulsion of the shock, known as an unstart, causes all the supersonic compression to take place externally through a single plane shock. The intake has changed in a <b>split</b> <b>second</b> from its most efficient configuration with most of its supersonic compression taking place inside the duct to the least efficient as shown by the large loss in pressure recovery, from about 80% to about 20% at M3 flight speeds.

25|$|Near 2:00 A.M. on April 27, 1865, when Sultana {{was just}} seven {{miles north of}} Memphis, her boilers {{suddenly}} exploded. First one boiler exploded, followed a <b>split</b> <b>second</b> later by two more. The cause of the explosion was too much pressure and low water in the boilers. There was reason to believe allowable working steam pressure was exceeded {{in an attempt to}} overcome the spring river current. The enormous explosion of steam came from the top, rear of the boilers and went upward at a 45-degree angle, tearing through the crowded decks above, and completely demolishing the pilothouse. Without a pilot to steer the boat, Sultana became a drifting, floating hulk. The terrific explosion flung some of the passengers on deck into the water and destroyed a large section of the boat. The twin smokestacks toppled over, one backwards into the blasted hole, and one forward onto the crowded forward section of the upper deck. The forward part of the upper decks collapsed into the exposed furnace boxes, shoving kindling into the open fire boxes which soon caught fire and turned the remaining superstructure into an inferno. Survivors of the explosion panicked and raced {{for the safety of the}} water but in their weakened condition soon ran out of strength and began to cling to each other.

25|$|The {{main point}} of {{contention}} in the umpiring of the 1974–75 Ashes series was the intimidatory bowling of the Australian fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. There were a few other issues, though there were the usual cases of batsmen being given out or not out despite the differing opinions of the players and umpire. At the time, umpires had no recourse to slow motion replays and had to {{make decisions based on}} what they saw in a <b>split</b> <b>second,</b> with {{the benefit of the doubt}} always going to the batsman. As a result it was not uncommon for umpires to make mistakes, which over the course of a long series tended to cancel each other out. The best an umpire could do was to make an honest judgement based on what he saw. Tom Brooks and Robin Bailhache were the umpires in all six Tests, but were junior for so important a series. Brooks having made his debut in the 1970–71 Ashes series and Bailhache in the First Test at Brisbane. Unusually for Australian umpires of the time Brooks had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game. This helped England in 1970–71 when they had the fast bowlers John Snow and Bob Willis, but proved fatal for their batsmen in 1974–75.|$|E

The problem was solved by programmer James Fleming: the game's engine renders and applies textures to foreground objects in full 3D graphics, but—according to PC Gamer US—it displays a [...] "bitmapped background in the distance" [...] to provide the [...] "illusion of detail". As with Flight Unlimited and the CD-ROM release of System Shock, Terra Nova was designed to support head-mounted displays. The game features QSound technology.
