5|$|Krug {{was born}} Judith Fingeret in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 15, 1940. Her {{interest}} in {{freedom of speech}} was fostered from an early age. She recalled reading a book about sex education under the covers in her bedroom with a flashlight {{at the age of}} 12. Her mother found her and asked what she was doing. When she held up the book, her mother allowed her to continue reading and told her to turn on the bedroom light so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> properly and avoid damage to her eyes.|$|E
5|$|Her parents, Franciszek Ksawery Plater and Anna von der Mohl (Anna z Mohlów), {{divorced}} {{when she was}} nine years old, in 1815. She was brought up by distant relatives, Michał Plater-Zyberk and Izabela Helena Syberg zu Wischling, in their family's manor Līksna near Daugavpils (Dźwina), then Inflanty (now Latvia). Well-educated, Plater was brought up to appreciate the efforts of Tadeusz Kościuszko and the Prince Józef Poniatowski. She was fascinated by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, who <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> in the original German language. She was raised {{in an environment that}} valued the history of Poland, and her literary heroes included Princess Wanda and Adam Mickiewicz's Grażyna. She also admired Bouboulina, a woman who became one of the icons of the Greek uprising against the Ottomans, a Polish fighter Anna Dorota Chrzanowska, as well as Joan of Arc. These pursuits were accompanied by an early interest in equestrianism and marksmanship, quite uncommon for early 19th-century girls from aristocratic families. She was also deeply interested in Ruthenian and Belarusian folk culture. She had contacts and friends in the Filaret Association.|$|E
25|$|Sophie Germain {{thought that}} if the {{geometry}} method, which at that time referred to all of pure mathematics, could hold such fascination for Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study. So she pored over every book on mathematics in her father's library, even teaching herself Latin and Greek so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> works like those of Sir Isaac Newton and Leonhard Euler. She also enjoyed Traité d'Arithmétique by Étienne Bézout and Le Calcul Différentiel by Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin. Later, Cousin visited her in her house, encouraging her in her studies.|$|E
60|$|Dale's glance {{turned from}} Helen to Riggs. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read</b> this quiet gray gaze, but it thrilled her.|$|R
60|$|Anna, {{with the}} patient {{resignation}} of her sex, sat silent or at times endeavoured to read. She had taken down from the little wall-shelf Bunyan's Holy Living and Holy Dying. She tried to <b>read</b> it. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not. Then <b>she</b> had taken Dante's Inferno. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read</b> it. Then she had selected Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read</b> it either. Lastly, she had taken the Farmer's Almanac for 1911. The books lay littered about her as she sat in patient despair.|$|R
25|$|Some {{parallels}} of {{plot and}} attitude {{have been drawn}} between The Wanderer and early novels of Helen Craik, which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have <b>read</b> in the 1790s.|$|R
25|$|Bernadette {{was born}} on 7 January 1844 and baptized at the local parish church, St. Pierre's, on 9 January, her parents' wedding anniversary. Bernadette's godmother was Bernarde Casterot, her mother's sister, a {{moderately}} wealthy widow who owned a tavern. Hard times had fallen on France and the family lived in extreme poverty. Bernadette was a sickly child and possibly due to this only measured 4ft.7in. tall. She contracted cholera as a toddler and suffered severe asthma {{for the rest of}} her life. Bernadette attended the day school conducted by the Sisters of Charity and Christian Instruction from Nevers. Contrary to a belief popularized by Hollywood movies, St. Bernadette learned very little French, only studying French in school after age 13 due to being frequently ill and a poor learner. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> and write very little due to her frequent illness. She spoke the language of Occitan, which was spoken by the local population of the Pyrenees region at that time and to a lesser degree today (which is similar to Catalan spoken in eastern Spain).|$|E
500|$|Molly Brant {{was raised}} in a Mohawk culture that had become highly {{influenced}} by their English trading partners. [...] In Canajoharie, the Brants lived in a substantial colonial-style frame house and used many European household goods. The family attended the Church of England. Molly was fluent in Mohawk and English. It is not clear whether she was formally educated or whether <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> and write. There are several letters signed [...] "Mary Brant", but these may have been dictated by Molly and written by someone else. A letter from 1782 is signed with [...] "her mark", indicating that she may have been only semi-literate.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, [...] "With her husband's consent St. Frances practiced , and {{advanced}} {{in a life}} of contemplation. Her visions often assumed the form of drama enacted for her by heavenly personages. She had the gift of miracles and ecstasy, {{as well as the}} bodily vision of her guardian angel, had revelations concerning Purgatory and Hell, and foretold the ending of the Western Schism. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> the secrets of consciences and detect plots of diabolical origin. She was remarkable for her humility and detachment, her obedience and patience".|$|E
60|$|Helena {{pointed to}} the seat without answering. She was looking at Siegmund. He was distracted by the {{excitement}} of the moment, so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read</b> him.|$|R
60|$|Mary Erskine was silent. Presently {{she opened}} her drawer {{and took out the}} will and looked at it mysteriously. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read</b> a word of it.|$|R
50|$|She {{started her}} career with a {{voice-over}} for a Tyson Chicken commercial {{at the age}} of three. Acting coach Andrew Magarian helped her memorize lines as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In her {{earliest}} {{appearances in}} Uncanny X-Men, Psylocke possessed {{the power of}} telepathy. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> and project thoughts over long distances; control minds; manipulate people's minds and possess them; subdue and tap into other's powers; affect people's memories; project mental illusions; and generate psi-bolts that could stun, injure, or kill others. She could also project her astral self, and the astral bodies of other people, into the astral or physical plane. She could scan entire towns with her mind, and leaf through the psyches of the inhabitants of a city to learn of their condition or intentions. She was powerful enough to telepathically [...] "shout" [...] to her teammates in Australia {{while she was in}} Washington D.C. without the aid of any type of power-enhancing machinery such as Cerebro. She could also probe individuals to check up on their status.|$|E
2500|$|Both Theodosia and Burr had a [...] "passionate {{commitment}} to education" [...] and Theodosia educated her daughter as any wealthy male child would have been: <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> and write at 3, studied Latin, Greek and French, and had read Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by age 10. Burr handled {{more and more}} of this as Theodosia's health began to deteriorate. Her illness was not a shock – she had been ill as long as they had known each other – but by 1792 she was in regular pain, with doctors' prescriptions doing little to help. Burr offered to resign from the Senate {{to spend more time with}} her, but she refused to allow it, and she finally died on May 28, 1794. She was buried in the now defunct St. John's Burying Ground, which was associated with Trinity Church. [...] Burr later wrote that she was [...] "the best woman and finest lady" [...] he had ever known.|$|E
2500|$|An avid reader, young Margaret read [...] "boys' stories" [...] by G.A. Henty, the Tom Swift series, and the Rover Boys {{series by}} Edward Stratemeyer. Her mother read Mary Johnston's novels to her before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>read.</b> They both wept reading Johnston's The Long Roll (1911) and Cease Firing (1912). Between the [...] "scream of shells, the mighty onrush of charges, the grim and grisly {{aftermath}} of war", Cease Firing is a romance novel involving the courtship of a Confederate soldier and a Louisiana plantation belle with Civil War illustrations by N. C. Wyeth. She also read the plays of William Shakespeare, and novels by Charles Dickens and Sir Walter Scott. [...] Mitchell's two favorite children's books were by author Edith Nesbit: Five Children and It (1902) and The Phoenix and the Carpet (1904). She kept both on her bookshelf {{even as an}} adult and gave them as gifts. Another author whom Mitchell read as a teenager and who had a major impact in her understanding of the Civil War and Reconstruction was Thomas Dixon. Dixon's popular trilogy of novels The Leopard's Spots: A Romance of the White Man's Burden (1902), The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan (1905) and The Traitor: A Story of the Rise and Fall of the Invisible Empire (1907) all depicted in vivid terms a white South victimized during the Reconstruction by Northern carpetbaggers and freed slaves, with an especial emphasis upon Reconstruction as a nightmarish time when black men ran amok, raping white women with impunity. As a teenager, Mitchell liked Dixon's books {{so much that she}} organized the local children to put on dramatizations of his books. The picture the white supremacist Dixon drew of Reconstruction is now rejected as inaccurate, but at the time, the memory of the past was such it was widely believed by white Americans. In a letter to Dixon dated 10 August 1936, Mitchell wrote: [...] "I was practically raised on your books, and love them very much." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{spite of}} his self-control, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> always <b>read</b> her father's {{thoughts}} quicker than he <b>could</b> <b>read</b> hers, and {{knew that he was}} struggling between the wish that she should have a good time and the desire to convey some kind of warning. He said, with a sigh: ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was very}} much {{attracted}} by him. He looked so preoccupied, and his strange, blank silences, which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read,</b> moved her and made her wonder over him, made her feel reverential towards him.|$|R
60|$|He had {{gripped the}} arms of her chair, till <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feel it quiver beneath her. Would he drive his fist into her face that she managed to keep still smiling? But there only passed into his eyes an {{expression}} which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, Benaderet befriended Paul Henning, a {{scriptwriter}} {{on the radio}} production of Burns & Allen. She appeared on nineteen episodes of the show that he had written between 1947 and 1951, {{and became one of}} his regular television players with the first two seasons of Burns & Allen, a two-episode guest appearance as Blanche Morton on The Bob Cummings Show in 1956-57, and then her involvement in three of the most successful sitcoms of the 1960s. After reading the 1961 first script for The Beverly Hillbillies, Benaderet wanted to audition for the role of Granny. Despite considering her to be too buxom for his vision of the character as a small and wiry woman, Henning allowed her to test anyway. Irene Ryan would win the part; according to Henning, [...] "Bea {{took one look at the}} way Irene did the part and said to me, 'There's your Granny!'" [...] He additionally took Benaderet's suggestion of casting Harriet MacGibbon as Granny's rival Margaret Drysdale. Henning created for Benaderet the supporting character of Cousin Pearl Bodine, the middle-aged widowed mother of Jethro Bodine (Max Baer Jr.) and cousin of main character Jed Clampett (Buddy Ebsen), whom she convinces to move from his humble home in the Ozarks after he strikes oil on his property and becomes a millionaire. Prior to shooting the pilot, Benaderet enlisted a dialect coach to help her learn a hillbilly accent. Impressed with her performance while screening the pilot to potential sponsors, Henning made Cousin Pearl a recurring character in the 1962-63 first season as she moved into the Clampetts' Beverly Hills mansion, feuded with Granny, and pursued oil tycoon Mr. Brewster (Frank Wilcox) as a love interest. Bluegrass duo Flatt & Scruggs, who performed the show's opening theme, recorded a comedic serenade in 1963 titled [...] "Pearl Pearl Pearl", and Benaderet was pictured with the duo on the single's cover. Benaderet described Pearl's curly hair as [...] "just my mental image of the character. ... Pearl played the piano for the silent movies and she saw such high fashion and ridiculous hairdos. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> and write, and the curled hair seemed to Pearl the height of smartness." [...] Her performance as Pearl was well received; author Stephen Cox wrote in his 1993 book The Beverly Hillbillies: From the Small Screen to the Big Screen: [...] "When The Beverly Hillbillies first aired, it started to become 'The Bea Benaderet Show.' Every scene that had Cousin Pearl in it was just about stolen by the actress." ...|$|E
60|$|He moved {{a little}} uneasily. All {{the time she}} was {{watching}} him. It seemed to her that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> the thoughts which were stirring in his brain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely {{she could}} learn Persian," [...] broke in a thin, elderly gentleman. [...] "Is there no retired {{schoolmaster}} or man of letters in Manchester with whom <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> Persian?" ...|$|E
60|$|Often he was {{abstracted}} when he {{was with}} her, in the office or out. Always he was kindly, but the kindliness seemed artificial. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read</b> his thoughts, now that she had no hand-clasp to guide her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, if I {{were set}} to such a task, I would so gladly learn it, that I might be a fitter friend for you," [...] said the girl, reverently turning {{the pages of the}} book <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cline was {{introduced}} to music at an early age, singing in church with her mother. She liked stars such as Kay Starr, Jo Stafford, Hank Williams, Judy Garland, and Shirley Temple. She had perfect pitch. Self-taught, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read</b> music.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's poor Mammy!" [...] said Eva. [...] "She does {{love the}} Bible so much, and wishes so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>read!</b> And what will she do when I can't read to her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, she did; {{she told}} me that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> all sorts of things in my face, and offered, if I would give myself up to it, to make me more than human." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'At the convent, mademoiselle. The good sisters {{teach us}} the catechism, also {{to write and}} read and sew. I like it much,' and Marie glanced at the little prayer in her apron pocket, as if proud to show <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> it.|$|E
60|$|Jean cast a {{careless}} {{glance at the}} illuminations, and exclaimed at Queen Isabel's high headgear and her becloaked greyhound. Eleanor looked and longed, and sighed that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read</b> the French, and only a {{very little of the}} Latin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, {{please leave}} me alone for a little while," [...] said Rachel, imploringly. She had caught sight of a little note {{at the bottom of}} the basket, and she felt that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read</b> it under her mother's eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Sellyer, and {{his face}} almost broke into a laugh as he answered, [...] "here's an {{excellent}} thing--Golden Dreams--quite the most humorous book of the season--simply screaming--my wife was reading it aloud only yesterday. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>read</b> for laughing." ...|$|R
60|$|Grandmother {{had very}} little learning. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> and write of course, and she made {{frequent}} pathetic attempts to open her Bible or glance at a newspaper--all to little purpose, for her days were filled from dawn to dark with household duties.|$|E
6000|$|... "A treasure," [...] said George; [...] "a beautiful, intelligent, amiable girl. Very pious. My {{mother had}} brought her up, and trained her as carefully, almost, as a daughter. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> and write, {{embroider}} and sew, beautifully; and was a beautiful singer." ...|$|E
6000|$|Turning {{suddenly}} {{from the}} sight, I found Charmion watching {{me with her}} quick eyes--watching as though she would search my heart. And, indeed, something of my thought must have been written on my face in a language that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>read,</b> for she whispered in my ear: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! With {{how much}} reason!" [...] cried the Blind Girl. With such fervency, that Caleb, though his motives were so pure, could not endure {{to meet her}} face; but dropped his eyes, as if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have <b>read</b> in them his {{innocent}} deceit.|$|R
6000|$|... "A charming book," [...] {{said the}} manager. [...] "It's a love story--very simple and sweet, yet wonderfully charming. Indeed, the reviews say it's the most charming {{book of the}} month. My wife was reading it aloud only last night. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>read</b> for tears." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{sight of}} two dolls {{in such a}} place made her feel as if fairies had dropped them there for her. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read</b> the {{direction}} and hurried home to show her treasure to her brothers and sisters of whom there were eight.|$|R
