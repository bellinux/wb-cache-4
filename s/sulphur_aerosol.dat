40|$|ABSTRACT. Explosive {{volcanic}} eruptions can inject {{large quantities of}} sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere. The aerosols that result from oxidationof the sulphur dioxide can pro-duce significant cooling of the troposphere by reflecting or absorbing solar radiation. It is possible to obtain {{an estimate of the}} relative stratospheric <b>sulphur</b> <b>aerosol</b> concentrationpro-duced by different volcanoes by comparing sulphuric acid fluxes determined by analysis of polar ice cores. Here, we use a non-sea-salt sulphate time series derived fromthreewell-dated Law Dome ice cores to investigate sulphuric acid flux ratios for major eruptions over the period AD 1301 ^ 1995. We use additional data from other cores to investigate systematic spa-tial variability in the ratios. Only for the Kuwae eruption (Law Dome ice date AD 1459. 5) was the H 2 SO 4 flux larger than that deposited byTambora (LawDome ice dateAD 1816. 7) ...|$|E
40|$|The Northern Aerosol Regional Climate Model (NARCM) is used {{to study}} the {{visibility}} and three-dimensional (3 -D) evolution of aerosol distributions within the Mexico City basin. NARCM simulates transport, diffusion, deposition, and size distributions of <b>sulphur</b> <b>aerosol</b> particles in the region. The model assumes only simple sulphur oxidation, not taking explicitly into account the urban air chemistry. Rather, it focuses on detailed aerosol microphysics and 3 -D optical properties. The simulation performance is compared with upper air and ground-based observations for the following specific days of intensive measurement: 2, 4, and 14 March 1997. Time series at Mexico City airport shows lower values of visibility in the morning due to a shallow mixed layer and higher values in the afternoon following {{the evolution of the}} mixed layer depth. Modeled visibility shows large dependence on cardinal direction and size distribution of particles. It is found that better resolution of particle size leads to better representation of coagulation processes and to realistic size distributions which show a characteristic accumulation mode around 0. 3 μm. As a result, visibility simulations are closer to those observed at the airport location. Comparing visibility is a stringent test for the model because it requires an accurate representation of 3 -D meteorological fields together with a realistic aerosol simulation...|$|E
40|$|Recently, climate {{engineering}} and particularly <b>sulphur</b> <b>aerosol</b> injection (SAI) {{have entered the}} arena of international climate change politics. The idea behind SAI is very simple: to reflect sunlight and heat back into space by injecting particles into the stratosphere. SAI has the theoretical potential to moderate anthropogenic climate change {{in a timely fashion}} and at very low costs but may also cause major environmental harm. Determining the future of SAI will entail dealing with many major uncertainties such as assessing risks, costs and benefits. This paper critically investigates scientific knowledge production under conditions of major uncertainty. It discusses how uncertainty, ethics and social considerations are treated in the SAI literature, which applies techno-economic models. In the simplest studies, important uncertainties are excluded from the models, but the more complex studies include many uncertainties, which may have considerable influence on the results and recommendations. In some cases the modelled results are overshadowed or strengthened by ethical discussions or methodological reflexivity that emphasize uncertainties and model limitations. There seems to be ambivalence between constructing certainty, on one hand, and an awareness of methodological limitations, on the other. Finally, the value of these papers for decision-makers and other concerned groups is discussed. LUC...|$|E

30|$|Some 80 % {{of populations}} in Asia {{are exposed to}} aerosol {{concentrations}} that exceed WHO guidelines (Carmichael et al. 2009). Exposure to the particulate matter in polluted air causes cardiac and respiratory disease, amounting to some 500, 000 deaths per year (Nel 2005). The combined health costs due to particulate pollution in Beijing amount to between US$ 1.6 and 3.6 billion annually, equivalent to over 6 % of this cities gross domestic product (Zhang et al. 2007). Globally, the health impacts and consequent economic costs of aerosol emissions are estimated to lie between US$ 120 and 510 billion annually (Selin et al. 2011).

5|$|Tectonic {{movement}} by the Indian Plate {{caused it to}} pass over a geologic hotspot—the Réunion hotspot—now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60–68Ma, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed to the global Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation. Elevated atmospheric levels of <b>sulphur</b> gases formed <b>aerosols</b> such as <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and sulphuric acid, similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to the greenhouse effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|R
40|$|Size {{differentiated}} aerosols {{were collected}} downstream from a heating plant fueled with eastern coal and analyzed using particle induced X-ray emission technique. Based on aerosol masses collected in various size ranges, the aerosol size distribution {{is determined to}} be trimodal, with the three peaks centered at 0. 54 microns, 4. 0 microns, and 11. 0 microns, respectively. Of the various trace elements present in the <b>aerosols,</b> <b>sulphur</b> is the only element that shows very strong concentration in the smallest size group. Iron is strongly concentrated in the 4. 0 micron group. Potassium, calcium, and titanium also exhibit stronger concentration in the 4. 0 micron group than any other group. Other trace elements - vanadium, chromium, manganese, nickel, copper, and barium - are equally divided between the 0. 54 microns and the 4. 0 microns groups. Apparently, all of the trace elements - except S - enter aerosols during the initial formation and subsequent condensation phases in the combustion process. Excess concentration of sulphur in the 0. 54 microns group can only {{be accounted for by}} recondensation of sulphur vapors on the combustion aerosols and gas-to-particle phase conversion of sulfate vapors at the stack top...|$|R

We apply {{a variety of techniques}} and our own retrieval model to retrieve the concentration of three other species: SO 2,OCS and SF 6. Sulphur Dioxide (SO 2) is an acidic gas with both natural and anthropogenic sources that is rapidly converted to sulphuric acid and hence sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere. Carbonyl Sulphide (OCS) is produced naturally at the ocean surface and by biomass burning and, through stratospheric oxidation, it is thought to be the main contributor to non-volcanic stratospheric sulphate <b>aerosols.</b> <b>Sulphur</b> Hexafluoride (SF 6) is almost entirely anthropogenic in its origins and shows steady year-on-year increases making it useful for age of air and tracer studies.

40|$|An {{overview}} of the goals and achievements of the European PartEmis project (Measurement and prediction of emissions of aerosols and gaseous precursors from gas turbine engines) is presented. PartEmis was focussed on the characterisation and quantification of exhaust emissions from a gas turbine engine. The engine was composed of a combustor and a unit to simulate a 3 -shaft turbine section (so-called Hot End Simulator; HES). A comprehensive suite of aerosol, gas and chemi-ion measurements were conducted under different, i) combustor and HES operating conditions, ii) fuel <b>sulphur</b> concentrations. Measured <b>aerosol</b> properties were mass and number concentration, size distribution, mixing state, thermal stability of internally mixed particles, hygroscopicity, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation potential, and chemical composition. Furthermore, chemi-ions, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and OH were monitored. The combustor operation conditions corresponded to modern and older engine gas path temperatures at cruise altitude, with fuel sulphur contents (FSC) of 0. 05, 0. 41, and 1. 270 g kg − 1. The combustor behaved like a typical aircraft engine combustor with respect to thermodynamic data and main emissions, {{which suggests that the}} PartEmis database may be applicable to contemporary aircraft engines. The conclusions drawn from the PartEmis experiment are discussed separately for combustion particles, ultrafine particles, sulphate-containing species and chemi-ions, particle hygrioscopic growth and CCN activation, gaseous organic fraction, and emission properties...|$|R
40|$|The global {{distribution}} of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) {{is the fundamental}} quantity that determines how changes in aerosols affect climate through changes in cloud drop concentrations, cloud albedo and precipitation. Aerosol-cloud interaction effects are {{a major source of}} uncertainty in climate models so it is important to quantify the sources of uncertainty and thereby direct research efforts. However, the computational expense of global aerosol models has prevented a full statistical analysis of their outputs. Here we perform a variance-based analysis of a global 3 -D aerosol microphysics model to quantify the magnitude and leading causes of parametric uncertainty in model-estimated present-day CCN concentrations. Twenty-eight model parameters covering essentially all important aerosol processes, emissions and representation of aerosol size distributions were defined based on expert elicitation. An uncertainty analysis was then performed based on a Monte Carlo-type sampling of an emulator built for each monthly-mean model grid cell from an ensemble of 168 one-year model simulations covering the uncertainty space of the 28 parameters. The standard deviation around the mean CCN varies globally between about ± 30 % of the mean over some marine regions to ± 40 – 100 % over most land areas and high latitudes. The results imply that aerosol processes and emissions are likely to be a significant source of uncertainty in model simulations of aerosol-cloud effects on climate. Variance decomposition enables the importance of the parameters for CCN uncertainty to be quantified and ranked from local to global scales. Among the most important contributors to CCN uncertainty are the sizes of emitted primary particles, including carbonaceous combustion particles from wildfires, biomass burning and fossil fuel use, as well as sulphate particles formed on sub-grid scales. Emissions of carbonaceous combustion particles affect CCN uncertainty more than <b>sulphur</b> emissions. <b>Aerosol</b> emission-related parameters dominate the uncertainty close to sources, while uncertainty in aerosol microphysical processes becomes increasingly important in remote regions, being dominated by deposition and aerosol sulphate formation during cloud-processing. Most of the 28 parameters are important for CCN uncertainty somewhere on the globe. The results lead to several recommendations for research that would result in improved modelling of cloud-active aerosol on a global scale...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe European PartEmis project (''Measurement and {{prediction}} of emissions of aerosols and gaseous precursors from gas turbine engines'') was focussed on the characterisation and quantification of exhaust emissions from a gas turbine engine. A comprehensive suite of aerosol, gas and chemi-ion measurements were conducted under different combustor operating conditions and fuel <b>sulphur</b> concentrations. Combustion <b>aerosol</b> characterisation included on-line measurements of mass and number concentration, size distribution, mixing state, thermal stability of internally mixed particles, hygroscopicity, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation potential, and off-line analysis of chemical composition. Modelling of CCN activation of combustion particles was conducted using microphysical and chemical properties {{obtained from the}} measurements as input data. Based on this unique data set, the role of sulphuric acid coatings on the combustion particles, formed in the cooling exhaust plume through either direct condensation of gaseous sulphuric acid or coagulation with volatile condensation particles nucleating from gaseous sulphuric acid, {{and the role of}} the organic fraction for the CCN activation of combustion particles was investigated. It was found that particles containing a large fraction of non-volatile organic compounds grow significantly less at high relative humidity than particles with a lower content of non-volatile OC. Also the effect of the non-volatile OC fraction on the potential CCN activation is significant. While a coating of water-soluble sulphuric acid increases the potential CCN activation, or lowers the activation diameter, respectively, the non-volatile organic compounds, mainly found at lower combustion temperatures, can partially compensate this sulphuric acid-related enhancement of CCN activation of carbonaceous combustion aerosol particles...|$|R
40|$|A {{spatially}} resolved biomass burning data set, {{and related}} emissions of <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and <b>aerosol</b> chemical constituents was constructed for India, for 1996 - 1997 and extrapolated to the INDOEX period (1998 - 1999). Sources include biofuels (wood, crop waste and dung-cake) and forest fires (accidental, shifting cultivation and controlled burning). Particulate matter (PM) emission factors were compiled {{from studies of}} Indian cooking stoves and from literature for open burning. Black carbon (BC) and organic matter (OM) emissions were estimated from these, accounting for combustion temperatures in cooking stoves. Sulphur dioxide emission factors were based on fuel sulphur content and reported literature measurements. Biofuels accounted 93 % of total biomass consumption (577 MT yr(- 1)), with forest fires contributing only 7 %. The national average biofuel mix was 56 : 21 : 23 % of fuelwood, crop waste and dung-cake, respectively. Compared to fossil fuels, biomass combustion was a minor source of SO(2) (7 % of total), with higher emissions from dung-cake because of its higher sulphur content. PM(2. 5) emissions of 2. 04 Tg yr(- 1) with an "inorganic fraction" of 0. 86 Tg yr(- 1) were estimated. Biomass combustion was {{the major source of}} carbonaceous aerosols, accounting 0. 25 Tg yr(- 1) of BC (72 % of total) and 0. 94 Tg yr(- 1) of OM (76 % of total). Among biomass, fuelwood and crop waste were primary contributors to BC emissions, while dung-cake and forest fires were primary contributors to OM emissions, Northern and the cast-coast India had high densities of biomass consumption and related emissions. Measurements of emission factors of SO(2) size resolved aerosols and their chemical constituents for Indian cooking stoves are needed to refine the present estimates. (C) 2002. ...|$|R
40|$|A comprehensive, {{spatially}} resolved (0. 25 degrees x 0. 25 degrees) {{fossil fuel}} consumption database and emissions inventory was constructed, for India, for the first time. Emissions of <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and <b>aerosol</b> chemical constituents were estimated for 1996 - 1997 and extrapolated to the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) study period (1998 - 1999). District level consumption of coal/lignite, petroleum and natural gas in power plants. industrial, transportation and domestic sectors was 9411 PJ, with major contributions from coal (54 %) followed by diesel (18 %). Emission factors for various pollutants were derived using India specific fuel characteristics and information on combustion/air pollution control technologies for the power and industrial sectors. Domestic and transportation emission factors, appropriate for Indian source characteristics, were compiled from literature. SO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion for 1996 - 1997 were 4. 0 Tg SO 2 yr(- 1), with 756 large point sources (e. g. utilities, iron and steel, fertilisers, cement, refineries and petrochemicals and non-ferrous metals), accounting for 62 %. PM 2. 5 emitted was 0. 5 and 2. 0 Tg yr(- 1) for the 100 % and the 50 % control scenario, respectively, applied to coal burning in the power and industrial sectors. Coal combustion was {{the major source of}} PM 2. 5 (92 %) primarily consisting of fly ash, accounting for 98 % of the "inorganic fraction" emissions (difference between PM 2. 5 and black carbon + organic matter) of 1. 6 Tg yr(- 1). Black carbon emissions were estimated at 0. 1 Tg yr(- 1), with 58 % from diesel transport. and organic matter emissions at 0. 3 Tg yr(- 1), with 48 % from brick-kilns. Fossil fuel consumption and emissions peaked at the large point industrial sources and 22 cities, with elevated area fluxes in northern and western India. The spatial resolution of this inventory makes it suitable for regional-scale aerosol-climate studies. These results are compared to previous studies and differences discussed. Measurements of emission factors for Indian sources are needed to further refine these estimates. (C) 2002. ...|$|R
40|$|We compare future {{changes in}} global mean {{temperature}} in response to different future scenarios which, for the first time, arise from emission driven rather than concentration driven perturbed parameter ensemble of a Global Climate Model (GCM). These new GCM simulations sample uncertainties in atmospheric feedbacks, land carbon cycle, ocean physics and <b>aerosol</b> <b>sulphur</b> cycle processes. We find broader ranges of projected temperature responses arising when considering emission rather than concentration driven simulations (with 10 – 90 percentile ranges of 1. 7 K for the aggressive mitigation scenario up to 3. 9 K for the high end business as usual scenario). A small minority of simulations resulting from combinations of strong atmospheric feedbacks and carbon cycle responses show temperature increases in excess of 9 degrees (RCP 8. 5) and even under aggressive mitigation (RCP 2. 6) temperatures in excess of 4 K. While the simulations point to much larger temperature ranges for emission driven experiments, they do not change existing expectations (based on previous concentration driven experiments) on the timescale that different sources of uncertainty are important. The new simulations sample a range of future atmospheric concentrations for each emission scenario. Both in case of SRES A 1 B and the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), the concentration pathways used to drive GCM ensembles lies towards {{the lower end of}} our simulated distribution. This design decision (a legecy of previous assessments) is likely to lead concentration driven experiments to under-sample strong feedback responses in concentration driven projections. Our ensemble of emission driven simulations span the global temperature response of other multi-model frameworks except at the low end, where combinations of low climate sensitivity and low carbon cycle feedbacks lead to responses outside our ensemble range. The ensemble simulates a number of high end responses which lie above the CMIP 5 carbon cycle range. These high end simulations can be linked to sampling a number of stronger carbon cycle feedbacks and to sampling climate sensitivities above 4. 5 K. This latter aspect highlights the priority in identifying real world climate sensitivity constraints which, if achieved, would lead to reductions on the uppper bound of projected {{global mean temperature}} change. The ensembles of simulations presented here provides a framework to explore relationships between present day observables and future changes while the large spread of future projected changes, highlights the ongoing need for such work...|$|R
