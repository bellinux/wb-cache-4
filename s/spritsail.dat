5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square <b>spritsail.</b> According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which the sails were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E
5|$|With Cooke dead, Cumby assumed command. Bellerophons decks {{had largely}} been cleared by French fire, and {{boarding}} parties {{began to make}} their way onto the ship. Several French sailors climbed out onto Bellerophons <b>spritsail</b> yard, but a Bellerophon crewman released the brace holding the yard, causing them to fall into the sea. French sailors holding onto Bellerophons rails had their hands beaten until they were forced to let go. Bellerophons ensign had been shot away three times, so infuriating her yeoman of signals, Christopher Beaty, that he took the largest Union Jack he could find and climbed up into the mizzen rigging and hoisted it across the shrouds. The French riflemen on Aigle reportedly held their fire as he did this, in admiration of his bravery. The two ships were so close together that gun crews on their lower decks were fighting hand to hand at the gunports, while grenades lobbed through the ports caused heavy casualties. One grenade thrown into Bellerophon exploded in the gunner's storeroom, blowing open the door but fortunately blowing closed the door of the magazine. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a catastrophic explosion.|$|E

25|$|Lady of the Lea is a <b>spritsail</b> Thames sailing barge, {{the last}} such barge {{to be built}} in England. She was built in 1931 to carry {{explosives}} from Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills on the River Lea to Woolwich Arsenal on the River Thames. The barge was later sold and rebuilt. She currently operates as a private yacht and competes in Thames sailing barge matches.|$|E
25|$|By {{the first}} half of the 1st century AD, {{steering}} gear mounted on the stern were also quite common in Roman river and harbour craft as proved from reliefs and archaeological finds (Zwammderdam, Woerden 7). A tomb plaque of Hadrianic age shows a harbour tug boat in Ostia with a long stern-mounted oar for better leverage. Interestingly, the boat already featured a <b>spritsail,</b> adding to the mobility of the harbour vessel. Further attested Roman uses of stern-mounted steering oars includes barges under tow, transport ships for wine casks, and diverse other ship types. Also, the well-known Zwammerdam find, a large river barge at the mouth of the Rhine, featured a large steering gear mounted on the stern. According to new research, the advanced Nemi ships, the palace barges of emperor Caligula (37-41 AD), may have featured 14 m long rudders.|$|E
500|$|Bellerophon {{now found}} herself in a desperate position. The much more {{powerful}} three-decked Orient fired several broadsides into the Bellerophon, smashing her boats, dismounting guns and cutting rigging. French marines on the higher decks poured volleys of musket fire onto Bellerophons exposed upper decks. Between 60 and 70 of her crew were killed or wounded in the first stages of the engagement, including Darby, who was rendered unconscious by a head wound. Command then devolved to the first lieutenant, Lieutenant Daniel. Daniel and the second lieutenant, Lieutenant Lander, were both wounded, but were able to direct the fighting until a shot took away Daniel's left leg. As he was carried below {{he was hit by}} grapeshot and killed outright. The fourth lieutenant, John Hadaway, was wounded and was taken below to the surgeon, while the fifth lieutenant, George Joliffe, was killed on the deck. After an hour fighting Orient alone, Bellerophons mizzenmast collapsed, followed shortly afterwards by the mainmast. Lieutenant Lander was among those killed in the fall of the mainmast, and command devolved to the third lieutenant, the uninjured Lieutenant Robert Cathcart. Several fires had broken out on both Bellerophon and Orient. [...] According to the Bellerophons logbook, at 9pm, when a further fire broke out on the Orient, Cathcart was down below on duty, and the 13 year old Midshipman John Hindmarsh was briefly the senior officer on deck. [...] He ordered the anchor cable cut and the <b>spritsail</b> was hoisted, but put too great a strain on the foremast, which collapsed. Now totally dismasted, Bellerophon began to drift away from the action, her crew fighting fires. As she moved out of the line she received some long range shots from the French Tonnant.|$|E
50|$|To a spar - Sails {{attached}} to a spar include both square sails and such fore-and-aft quadrilateral sails as lug rigs, junk and <b>spritsails</b> and such triangular sails as the lateen, and the crab claw.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spritsails</b> were {{commonly}} used on sailing vessels from the first carracks until about 1800. Until the mid-18th century, most ships also flew a sprit-topsail from the short sprit topmast that rose vertically above the fore end of the bowsprit.|$|R
50|$|The full-rigged {{ships of}} {{the golden age of}} sail had no <b>spritsails,</b> as the area under the {{bowsprit}} was instead occupied by rigging (martingales and dolphin striker) that reinforced the bowsprit and jib-boom against the forces of an increasing number of jibs.|$|R
500|$|Pallas {{returned}} on 12 May with [...] and a 16-gun ship-sloop, [...] Allemande despatched {{two large}} frigates and three corvettes; facing unfavourable winds, the British withdrew. Two days later, Pallas and Kingfisher {{came back and}} Allemande again ordered Minerve, Lynx, Sylphe, and Palinure to chase Cochrane off. As a precaution, he also had two other large frigates, [...] and , cleared for action and ready to go. Collett ordered his ships to set all sail {{in the hope of}} catching Pallas before she could escape, but Cochrane was in no hurry to leave and even attempted to draw the French on by backing his topsails and slowing down. Once in range, Pallas opened fire, bringing down the topsail yard of one of the smaller vessels and then retreating into nearby shoals with Minerve in pursuit. By 13:00 Minerve had come up on the leeward side of Pallas, whereupon Pallas fired into her and closed with the intention of boarding. Just at that moment, Minerve hit a sandbank and Pallas crashed into her. The force of the collision, great enough to jolt Pallass guns from their positions, did not prevent her from unleashing a devastating broadside. Both ships were damaged but Pallass shallower draught prevented her grounding. Her crew were able to disengage and get back under way, having seen the two 40-gun French frigates, Armide and Infatigable, drawing near. The crew of Kingfisher sailed in to take Pallas in tow; the latter had lost her fore topmast, jib-boom, <b>spritsail,</b> stunsail, and main topsail yards. Minerve was only lightly damaged; she was re-floated and taken to Rochefort for repair. The engagement cost the lives of seven seamen aboard Minerve, with a further fourteen injured. There were a further one dead and five wounded aboard Pallas.|$|E

60|$|He went to sleep, however, wet as he was, {{and after}} an early breakfast next morning they started again, with both <b>spritsails</b> up in torrential rain.

The hunters have experimented and practised with their rifles and shotguns till they are satisfied, and the boat-pullers and steerers have made their <b>spritsails,</b> bound the oars and rowlocks in leather and sennit so that they will make no noise when creeping on the seals, and put their boats in apple-pie order—to use Leach’s homely phrase.|$|R

2500|$|Munroe, however, was {{a talented}} boat {{designer}} {{who was able}} to work around the problems with the drawings. [...] His adaptations can be seen in successive proas. [...] Rather than the deep, asymmetric hull of a traditional proa, Munroe created flat-bottomed hulls (similar to the fisolera referred to by Pigafetta), with keels or centerboards for lateral resistance. [...] His first iteration had an iron center fin with a half-oval profile. [...] Rather than the traditional crab-claw sail's spars which meet at the front, Munroe's sails used what could be described as a triangular lug sail or <b>spritsail</b> with a boom, similar to the modern lateen sail with a shorter upper spar.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the battle}} started Nelson's flagship, [...] broke the line ahead of Neptune, passing by and raking Bucentaure. As Victory passed by Neptune fired into {{her with a}} {{broadside}} from her larboard battery, damaging Victorys foremast, bowsprit, <b>spritsail</b> yards, her forward hull and her anchors. [...] Maistral then ordered Neptunes jib run up, to move her out of Victorys range. She briefly engaged [...] at long range, and then wore back to support Villeneuve. Standing someway off to leeward Neptunes gunners reloaded, and then opened fire with a broadside into [...] as the British ship came up through the gap created by Victorys passage. The broadsides cut Temeraires rigging, brought down her foreyard and main topmast, and damaged her fore mast and bowsprit. By now unmanageable, Temeraire came under fire from the San Justo, lying just astern of Neptune.|$|E
60|$|As {{the boat}} ascended on a sea, her feet touched and I {{released}} her hands. I cast off the tackles and leaped after her. I had never rowed in my life, but I {{put out the}} oars and {{at the expense of}} much effort got the boat clear of the Ghost. Then I experimented with the sail. I had seen the boat-steerers and hunters set their <b>spritsails</b> many times, yet this was my first attempt. What took them possibly two minutes took me twenty, but in the end I succeeded in setting and trimming it, and with the steering-oar in my hands hauled on the wind.|$|R
50|$|A beakhead is the {{protruding}} part of {{the foremost}} section of a sailing ship. It was fitted on sailing vessels from the 16th to the 18th century {{and served as a}} working platform by sailors working the sails of the bowsprit, the forward-pointing mast that carries the <b>spritsails.</b> The beakhead {{would be one of the}} most ornate sections of a ship, particularly in the extravagant Baroque-style ships of the 17th century. The sides were often decorated with carved statues and located directly underneath was the figurehead, usually in the form of animals, shields or mythological creatures. The beakhead also housed the crew's toilets (head), which would drop refuse straight into the sea without sullying the ship's hull unnecessarily.|$|R
60|$|One of the Siwash {{shook out}} the two <b>spritsails</b> which {{sat on a}} pole {{stretching}} up to the peak from {{the foot of the}} mast, and when he had led the sheets aft his companion knelt astern with a paddle held over the gunwale. Slanting gently down to the faint breeze, the craft slid away through the smooth, green water with a long ripple running back behind her. The log houses dropped astern and were lost among the trees, a valley filled with somber forest, and a rampart of tall hillside, slipped by, and as they crept on from point to point the strip of still water stretched away before them between somber ranks of climbing trees.|$|R

60|$|I thought so, too, {{and said}} we didn't want the line anyway. Whereupon we cast off and hoisted the <b>spritsail.</b> The bullets ceased at once, and we sailed away, unpleasantly {{confident}} that Big Alec was laughing at our discomfiture.|$|E
60|$|The {{men were}} all French Canadians: a merry, careless, but persevering set of fellows, just {{cut out for}} the work they had to do, and, moreover, {{accustomed}} to it. The boat was a clumsy affair, with two <b>spritsails</b> and a jigger or mizzen; but, notwithstanding, she looked well at a distance, and though incapable of progressing very fast through the water, she could stand a pretty heavy sea. We were badly off, how ever, with regard to camp gear, having neither tent nor oilcloth to protect us should it rain--indeed, all we had to guard us from the inclemency of the weather at night was one blanket each man; but as the weather had been fine and settled for some time back, we hoped to get along pretty well.|$|R
50|$|The word {{bowsprit}} {{is thought}} to originate from the Middle Low German word bōchsprēt - bōch meaning bow and sprēt meaning pole. Early ocean-going vessels tended to tilt the bowsprit, also known in centuries past as a boltsprit, at a high angle, and hung one or two square <b>spritsails</b> from yards. In the 17th century and early 18th century a vertical sprit topmast was added {{near the end of}} the bowsprit and another square sail added to it; this was not a particularly successful design however, the mast tending to carry away in heavy weather. Fore-and-aft sails known as jibs hung from the stays proved more useful for speed and manoeuvring, and the basic bowsprit was lengthened with a jibboom and then even further with a flying jibboom, resulting in bowsprits of tremendous length, up to 30 metres total.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think it's {{quite high}} water yet, and the breeze is dropping," [...] Harry was saying. [...] "There's {{just enough to}} take us {{a mile or two}} down the beach over the tide with the <b>spritsail</b> set. Then we could lower the mast and paddle home." ...|$|E
60|$|I came on deck to {{find the}} Ghost heading up close on the port tack and cutting in to {{windward}} of a familiar <b>spritsail</b> close-hauled on the same tack ahead of us. All hands were on deck, for they knew that something was to happen when Leach and Johnson were dragged aboard.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they were}} gone astern. The <b>spritsail</b> filled with the wind, suddenly, {{careening}} the frail open craft till it seemed it would surely capsize. A whitecap foamed above it and broke across in a snow-white smother. Then the boat emerged, half swamped, Leach flinging the water out and Johnson clinging to the steering-oar, his face white and anxious.|$|E
6000|$|Time {{was heavy}} on my hands. I {{sat on the}} dock and talked it over with Nickey the Greek, another idle oyster pirate. [...] "Let's go," [...] said I, and Nickey was willing. He was [...] "broke." [...] I possessed fifty cents and a small skiff. The former I {{invested}} and loaded into the latter {{in the form of}} crackers, canned corned beef, and a ten-cent bottle of French mustard. (We were keen on French mustard in those days.) Then, late in the afternoon, we hoisted our small <b>spritsail</b> and started. We sailed all night, and next morning, on the first of a glorious flood-tide, a fair wind behind us, we came booming up the Carquinez Straits to Port Costa. There lay the stolen boat, not twenty-five feet from the wharf. We ran alongside and doused our little <b>spritsail.</b> I sent Nickey forward to lift the anchor, while I began casting off the gaskets.|$|E
60|$|Rasmunsen {{grinned and}} {{tightened}} his aching {{grip on the}} sweep. Scores of times had the send of the sea caught the big square stern of the Alma and thrown her off from dead before it till the after leach of the <b>spritsail</b> fluttered hollowly, and each time, and only with all his strength, had he forced her back. His grin by then had become fixed, and it disturbed the correspondents to look at him.|$|E
60|$|To the eastward Ua-huka {{was being}} blotted out by an evening rain- squall that was fast {{overtaking}} the Snark. But that little craft, her big spinnaker filled by the southeast trade, {{was making a}} good race of it. Cape Martin, the southeasternmost point of Nuku-hiva, was abeam, and Comptroller Bay was opening up as we fled past its wide entrance, where Sail Rock, {{for all the world}} like the <b>spritsail</b> of a Columbia River salmon-boat, was making brave weather of it in the smashing southeast swell.|$|E
60|$|I {{shook my}} head and {{regarded}} their work. It had indeed been bloody, for they had drawn off and joined our other three boats in the attack on the remaining two of the enemy. The deserted boat was in the trough of the sea, rolling drunkenly across each comber, its loose <b>spritsail</b> out at right angles to it and fluttering and flapping in the wind. The hunter and boat-puller were both lying awkwardly in the bottom, but the boat-steerer lay across the gunwale, half in and half out, his arms trailing in the water and his head rolling from side to side.|$|E
