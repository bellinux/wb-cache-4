40|$|Abstract — Cloud {{computing}} provides {{processing power}} {{in form of}} virtual machines. This processing power can be given to very big and small devices. Similarly for providing processing power, devices with small or big processing power can be utilized. These devices can also be ubiquitous <b>computing</b> <b>devices.</b> Ubiquitous <b>computing</b> <b>devices</b> present in environment may communicate with each other. Ubiquitous <b>computing</b> <b>devices</b> may also share load with each other. Spare processing power of these devices {{can also be used}} for cloud computing. An old, less powerful <b>computing</b> <b>device</b> which is capable of connecting with Internet can avail processing power of new <b>computing</b> <b>devices.</b> Problem with using spare processing power is lack of common benchmark for different types of ubiquitous <b>computing</b> <b>devices.</b> To assign proper workload in terms of processing power, devices must be tested according to one common benchmark. This paper presents the CBUDMicro (Common Benchmark for Ubiquitous <b>Computing</b> <b>Devices</b> Micro), an extendable common benchmark to evaluate performance of ubiquitous <b>computing</b> <b>devices</b> {{so that they can be}} used in cloud computing environment. CBUDMicro can be used at both cloud host and consumer side for performance and resource management by supporting scheduling decisions. This paper describes the vision and architecture of CBUDMicro in detail and core components implemented...|$|R
3000|$|There {{are several}} kinds of {{resampling}} methods, and the basic resampling method is called the single distribution resampling. Furthermore, single distribution resampling is subdivided into two categories called: traditional variation resampling and traditional resampling. Using traditional resampling benefits <b>computing</b> <b>devices</b> that need a single sampling process for every [...] j [...] cycle (for instance, <b>computing</b> <b>devices</b> that only have low memory requirements). On the other hand, the utilisation of traditional variation resampling is beneficial for <b>computing</b> <b>devices</b> that require {{more than a single}} sampling process for every j cycle (for instance, <b>computing</b> <b>devices</b> that have a high memory requirement). Although <b>computing</b> <b>devices</b> that have high memory requirement do not normally have problems with memory consumption, traditional variation resampling is often thought to be more appropriate for usage in this environment because it is faster than traditional resampling [58].|$|R

Implementations of the described techniques employ signal processing techniques and allocations of system functionality that are suitable given the generally limited capabilities of such handheld or portable <b>computing</b> <b>devices</b> and that facilitate efficient encoding and communication of the pitch-corrected vocal performances (or precursors or derivatives thereof) via wireless and/or wired bandwidth-limited networks for rendering on portable <b>computing</b> <b>devices</b> or other targets...|$|R

Wearable devices like smart watches and smart glasses, IoT devices like smart home hubs or smart plugs, are increasingly popular today. Those light-weight <b>computing</b> <b>devices</b> are usually equipped with limited computational power. However, both the PDE and the secure deletion usually require expensive encryption operations, and thus cannot directly fit the use of light-weight devices.

40|$|Mobile <b>computing</b> <b>devices</b> {{have started}} to become useful tools on {{construction}} sites. These devices can make large amounts of data available and support data collection tasks on a construction site. Even though battery life, computing power and data storage capacity have greatly improved and will probably not be limiting factors for mobile computing solutions, it is still difficult to interact with mobile <b>computing</b> <b>devices</b> efficiently. Some of the factors limiting efficient interaction are {{the size of the}} screen of a mobile <b>computing</b> <b>device,</b> the deficiency of a keyboard and the limited accuracy of the pointing device. The approach we pursue is to limit the interaction needed for specific tasks that are carried out using a mobile <b>computing</b> <b>device.</b> To do this we are working on developing Navigational Models, which reduce navigation through large data sets by grouping data entities closely together, according to the need to be accessed for a specific task. Moreover, Navigational Models appear to be a useful construct to enter and access data at the right level of detail, which they needed. In this paper, we discuss the need for more efficient interaction with mobile <b>computing</b> <b>devices</b> on construction sites and introduce Navigational Models...|$|R
