He said that in Islam man was not created to be led by a bridle, man was given intelligence so that he could be guided by knowledge. According to Abduh, a teacher’s role was to direct men towards study.

60|$|REVOLUTIONARY POETRY. The {{poetry of}} the Revolution, an {{abundant}} but weedy crop, was badly influenced by two factors: by the political strife between Patriots and Loyalists, and by the <b>slavish</b> <b>imitation</b> of Pope and other formalists who were then the models for nearly all versifiers {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. The former influence appears in numerous ballads or narrative poems, which were as popular in the days of Washington as ever they were in the time of Robin Hood. Every important event of the Revolution was promptly celebrated in verse; but as the country was then sharply divided, almost every ballad had a Whig or a Tory twist to it. In consequence we must read two different collections, such as Moore's Songs and Ballads of the American Revolution and Sargent's Loyalist Poetry of the Revolution, for supplementary views of the same great struggle.|$|E

This ottoman pottery has obvious stylistic similarities with the famous pieces manufactured in the Iznik workshops in the 16 th and 17 th centuries. This article is dedicated to the so-called Syrian Polychrome Ware probably manufactured in Damascus on a date that is difficult to specify. We will show how this Syrian Ottoman production was similar to the Iznik wares and how it differed. We will try to define the date of manufacture ¬— probably in the late 16 th and 17 th centuries — and identify the potters. Were they itinerant craftsmen who knew how to made Iznik pottery and, changing their place of residence, were making similar bowls with different raw materials? Were they potters from Damascus, the descendants of the Mamluk craftsmen? In that case, did they have at their disposal the original? The status of these objects is also raised. They were not <b>slavish</b> <b>imitations</b> but Iznik derivatives – the copy was partial, incomplete and of uneven quality. The objective of the potters was not copy to mislead the consumers but rather to take inspiration from the models to please. The study of archaeological finds and pottery preserved in European museums allow dealing with these issues...|$|R
2500|$|Many {{critics have}} noted the strong {{influence}} of Virgil's first-century Roman epic poem, the Aeneid, on Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra. Such influence should be expected, given the prevalence of allusions to Virgil in the Renaissance culture in which Shakespeare was educated. Moreover, as is well-known, the historical Antony and Cleopatra were the prototypes and antitypes for Virgil's Dido and Aeneas: Dido, ruler of the north African city of Carthage, tempts Aeneas, the legendary exemplar of Roman pietas, to forego his task of founding Rome {{after the fall of}} Troy. The fictional Aeneas dutifully resists Dido's temptation and abandons her to forge on to Italy, placing political destiny before romantic love, in stark contrast to Antony, who puts passionate love of his own Egyptian queen, Cleopatra, before duty to Rome. Given the well-established traditional connections between the fictional Dido and Aeneas and the historical Antony and Cleopatra, {{it is no surprise that}} Shakespeare includes numerous allusions to Virgil's epic in his historical tragedy. As Janet Adelman observes, [...] "almost all the central elements in Antony and Cleopatra are to be found in the Aeneid: the opposing values of Rome and a foreign passion; the political necessity of a passionless Roman marriage; the concept of an afterlife in which the passionate lovers meet." [...] However, as Heather James argues, Shakespeare's allusions to Virgil's Dido and Aeneas are far from <b>slavish</b> <b>imitations.</b> James emphasizes the various ways in which Shakespeare's play subverts the ideology of the Virgilian tradition; one such instance of this subversion is Cleopatra's dream of Antony in Act 5 ("I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony" [...] ). James argues that in her extended description of this dream, Cleopatra [...] "reconstructs the heroic masculinity of an Antony whose identity has been fragmented and scattered by Roman opinion." [...] This politically charged dream vision is just one example of the way that Shakespeare's story destabilises and potentially critiques the Roman ideology inherited from Virgil's epic and embodied in the mythic Roman ancestor Aeneas.|$|R

The Romans claimed to rule the world, and what lay outside their Empire was to them of no account. The Empire of Chien Lung was more extensive, with probably a larger population; it had risen to greatness {{at the same time as}} Rome, and had not fallen, but invariably defeated all its enemies, either by war or by absorption. Its neighbours were comparatively barbarous, except the Japanese, who acquired their civilization by <b>slavish</b> <b>imitation</b> of China. The view of Chien Lung was no more absurd than that of Alexander the Great, sighing for new worlds to conquer when he had never even heard of China, where Confucius had been dead already for a hundred and fifty years. Nor was he mistaken as regards trade: China produces everything needed for the happiness of its inhabitants, and we have forced trade upon them solely for our benefit, giving them in exchange only things which they would do better without.|$|E

In Russia, the methods of the Bolsheviks are probably more or less unavoidable; at any rate, I am not prepared to criticize them in their broad lines. But {{they are not the}} methods appropriate to more advanced countries, and our Socialists will be unnecessarily retrograde if they allow the prestige of the Bolsheviks to lead them into <b>slavish</b> <b>imitation.</b> It will be a far less excusable error in our reactionaries if, by their unteachableness, they compel the adoption of violent methods. We have a heritage of civilization and mutual tolerance which is important to ourselves and to the world. Life in Russia has always been fierce and cruel, to a far greater degree than with us, and out of the war has come a danger that this fierceness and cruelty may become universal. I have hopes that in England this may be avoided through the moderation of both sides. But it is essential to a happy issue that melodrama should no longer determine our views of the Bolsheviks: they are neither angels to be worshipped nor devils to be exterminated, but merely bold and able men attempting with great skill an almost impossible task.|$|E

A generation ago, I found out that the latest review of a book was pretty sure to be just a reflection of the earliest review of it; that whatever the first reviewer found to praise or censure in the book would be repeated in the latest reviewer's report, with nothing fresh added. Therefore more than once I took the precaution of sending my book, in manuscript, to Mr. Howells, when he was editor of the [...] "Atlantic Monthly," [...] so that he could prepare a review of it at leisure.

5000|$|Like his near-contemporary Constantin Lipsius, Auer was {{an eloquent}} {{advocate}} for architectural realism, a sophisticated theoretical stance that became increasingly {{significant in the}} 1880s on the continent. Architectural Realists sought to renew contemporary architecture through thoughtful reconsideration of the symbolic properties of the classical language of architectural expression; this [...] "realistic" [...] reconsideration required {{a new level of}} archaeological accuracy in the understanding of the emergence and evolution of specific forms. Auer's brilliant historical discussion of the triglyph (1880) comprised the basis for his own reflections on improving the existing state of contemporary architecture. Architectural realism enabled Auer's generation to disengage from <b>slavish</b> <b>imitation</b> of historical forms and hastened the emergence of more subtle perspectives on stylistic innovation. Auer's unique contribution as an architectural theorist was to expand the notion of architectural space as a significant aspect of style and evolution (1883), an accomplishment that is usually consigned to the art historian August Schmarsow (1893).|$|E
50|$|Lipsius was a {{thoughtful}} and philosophically inclined architect. His writings {{on the use}} of iron in architecture have found their way into several histories of architectural theory; his necrologies of both Semper and Nicolai are among the most well-conceived professional biographies of their time. His students remembered him with enormous affection. By the 1880s, Lipsius was an eloquent proponent of architectural realism, an approach to revitalizing contemporary architecture by changing the emphasis away from <b>slavish</b> <b>imitation</b> of historical forms by reconsidering the original and symbolic power of architectural motifs. Thus fortified, it was hoped by Architectural Realists in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France that stylistic innovation could continue to develop organically by salvaging worthy forms and discarding dry, pedantic and formulaic application of stock forms. Architectural Realism {{paved the way for the}} emergence of more strident perspectives on stylistic innovation we now recognize as pre-modernist, such as Jugendstil, Art Nouveau, Stile Liberty and other related stylistic phenomena that predate the rise of Neues Bauen (New Building) in the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|The Argonautica is {{modelled}} on Homers {{poetry to}} a profound extent. There {{are of course}} similarities in plots. The return journey in Book 4, for example, has many parallels in the Odyssey - Scylla, Charybdis, the Sirens and Circe are hazards that Odysseus also negotiates. The Argonautica is notable too for {{the high number of}} verses and phrases imitating Homer, and for the way it reproduces linguistic peculiarities of old epic, in syntax, metre, vocabulary and grammar. Apollonius in fact is the most Homeric of all the poets whose work has come down to us from the Hellenistic age, when Homeric scholarship flourished and almost all poets responded to Homers influence, including Callimachus. Homeric echoes in Argonautica are quite deliberate and are not <b>slavish</b> <b>imitation.</b> When Jason first meets Hypsipyle in Book 1, he wears a cloak made for him by Athena, embroidered with various scenes alluding to tragic women that Homers Odysseus met in Hades (Odyssey 11.225-380).

A famously dysfunctional reader, Don Quix-ote de la Mancha, opens the essay {{as an example of a}} soul imprisoned by books because it is subject to <b>slavish</b> <b>imitation.</b> With this caution firmly in view, I offer a series of tips on how readers of the Confessions can approach the work with appropriate freshness, developing strategies for reading not only Augustine but other great authors as well. I stress especially the dialogi-cal character of Confessions and, with it, Augustine’s qualified continuity with the Platonic-Socratic tradition of text-as-conversation. In so doing, I emphasize Augustine’s emerging pedagogy based on his understanding of the function of signs and the affective character of the poetic imagination. In this way, Augustine translates the Socratic tradition into a distinctively Christian idiom while providing a prospective antidote to Quixote’s mis-placed flights of intellectual and moral fancy, inviting the reader to begin his or her own independent spiritual journey...|$|E
40|$|The Beautiful and The Idea in 17 th-Century Aesthetics In his renowned {{lecture on}} the Idea, which he {{delivered}} at the Academy of Saint Luke in 1664, Giovan Pietro Bellori asserts the superiority of ideal beauty against the <b>slavish</b> <b>imitation</b> of reality and the unbridled freedom of the imagination. However, an equally important, albeit lesser known, contributor to the formulation of this classicist aesthetic theory is Giovan Battista Agucchi, author of a Treatise on Painting that appeared in fragmentary form in 1646. In this work, Agucchi identifes beauty as the truest and highest aim of painting; he attributes to the artist the power to contemplate the Idea, and confers a profound cognitive value to this form of imitation. Finally, he ponders on aesthetic judgement, addressing the issue, which became increasingly more relevant in the 17 th century, {{of the role of}} the connoisseur. Many of these themes would later be reelaborated, in a changed cultural context, by Bellori, who would define the co-ordinates of a strict classicism which centered on the selective paradigm of ideal beauty. Elisabetta Di Stefano proposes a comparative analysis of the two afore-mentioned texts which are reprinted in the appendices. Her study foregrounds the progressive ascent of the Idea from natural data to the perfection of beauty, a complex process that in the 18 th century, through the theories of Batteux and Winckelmann, will lead to the birth of modern aesthetics under the banner of ideal beauty...|$|E
40|$|Remix {{in writing}} has very {{different}} expressions, and {{is grounded in}} very different legal, philosophical and creative materialisms, in Western and Chinese cultures. The infringement of authors’ Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) in China {{is not only an}} irritant for Chinese-Western commercial and legal relations. It also points to different formations of the creative and legal domains across global space, and serves to introduce notions of creativity and originality that are largely unfamiliar in the West. Calligraphy, as a pictorial and material mode of writing, comprises a practice of Chinese remix in which the apprentice traces the lines of the master’s work: repetition of Yun 韵 (‘composed body movements’) stimulates the expression of Qing 情 (‘feelings’). What appears from a distance to be <b>slavish</b> <b>imitation</b> actually involves a philosophy of learning (or more precisely, of ‘unlearnt learning’) that, bypassing plagiarism’s traps, effectively ‘remixes remix’ as a creative model no longer dependent on the familiar Western rationales for the legitimacy of remix as appropriation, homage and/or pastiche. To see this though, one has to deploy a Taoist rather than a Confucian framework in the analysis of calligraphic practices. The case of Kathy Acker, allied with the work of Gilles Deleuze, reveals a largely invisible lineage of Taoist-influenced remix in Western creative writing. In this way, calligraphy emerges as a model of remix relevant to all forms of writing—for all writing is material, whether calligraphic or not. Further, as Acker shows, the materiality of writing constantly replenishes its remixing with cultural elements that may not be otherwise visible...|$|E
40|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the life of the Greek poet Theocritus are fairly well agreed upon. We know, for instance, that he flourished in the third century B. C. He was most likely born in Sicily and {{migrated}} at a later time to the Greek island of Cos and from there to Alexandria in Egypt, or he was Coan by birth and came to be associated with Sicily only later in his life. At any rate, he appeared in Alexandria at a time in history when this great city was the cultural center of the Eastern Mediterranean. He became part of the Alexandrian school, which, coming as it did upon the heels of the golden age of Greek literature, did what it could to avoid <b>slavish</b> <b>imitation</b> of its predecessors: All the Alexandrians had in common one characteristic, showing itself in a variety of forms, namely avoidance of the trite and commonplace. Hence all alike sought restlessly for subjects either new or capable of being treated from some new angle; and all used language which, while retaining the flavour of antiquity, showed at every turn some novelty of formation, shade of meaning, or collocation (Rose 1948 : 317). In particular they developed new genres such as the epyllion, or little epic, and epigram, miniature forms instead of the large-scale epic and drama. They also had a keen regard for form in both language and meter, and developed a taste for erudition as witnessed in their didactic poems and mythological allusions. In particular, they avoided large works and strove to expand upon previously treated material in ways that emphasized individuals ’ emotions or peculiarities. Theocritus ’ greatest contribution to the movement was a group of poems referred to today as the Idylls, which feature several pastoral poems, the first ever to appear in literary form, and which earned Theocritus the title of Father of Pastoral Poetry. We see here the beginnings of a genre that numbers among its followers such names as Bion and Moschus amon...|$|E
40|$|Although the haiku form is popular, the {{deceptively simple}} Japanese poem is {{controlled}} by rigorous rules which are difficult to apply in English due to basic differences of language and poetic tradition. It is important that would-be writers of English haiku {{be aware of the}} problems. The three-line Japanese haiku grew from the first three lines of linked verse which was popular in seventeenth-century Japan. The spirit of Zen Buddhism permeates haiku and behind the respect for nature and common things found in haiku lies the long history of oriental religions. Arts related to Zen Buddhism, all stressing the moment of enlightenment, also have exercised an influence upon haiku. Yet Zen itself, and haiku as a poetry form are compatible with western religious thought and poetics. A one-stanza poem containing only three lines, at first sight, seems foreign to English prosody, but closer examination shows that it is not necessarily foreign. Although division into five, seven and five syllables seems arbitrary, and the total of seventeen syllables seems light, the reasons for the form and the methods of compensating for the brevity are solid. One of the methods of adding weight to the form is the traditional use of a word indicating one of the seasons and thus conscripting all the beauty of nature. Special haiku techniques also add consequence to the brief poetry form. Simple diction ensures a limpidity which is the special cachet of haiku. Natural imagery uses an object in nature as a sufficient symbol: assonance alliteration and onomatopoeia are used much in the same manner in both languages; special Japanese techniques are compensated for in some measure by English punctuation, "kennings", and syntactical pivoting. Verbal dexterity, found in Japanese haiku does have equivalent forms in English literature and some of these are examined, as is the use of allusion, enjambment, rhyme and rhythm. It was recommended that haiku poets should deepen their knowledge of Japanese haiku as a foundation for a truly native English haiku tradition based on the western Judao-Christian culture. With regard to the spirit of haiku, the avoidance of studied profundity and of sentimental devices such as anthropomorphism was recommended; with regard to the form, greater attention to the method of syllable counting, punctuation and tone and avoidance of <b>slavish</b> <b>imitation</b> was advised. Haiku is seen to be possible in English and highly advantageous to English letters. 1 Joan Giroux, master's thesis presented to the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ottawa, Ontario, July 1968, iii [...] 143 pp...|$|E
