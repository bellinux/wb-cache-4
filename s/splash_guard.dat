5000|$|A shower <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> is a {{permanently}} installed, fixed, rigid fitting made {{of plastic}} or glass that prevent water from a shower from splashing out of the bathtub and onto the floor. [...] Typically, the shower <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> is a small triangular piece of plastic that is used in combination with a shower curtain, to prevent water escaping at the corners, {{but it may be}} a much larger piece that is used by itself.|$|E
50|$|The shower <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> is {{designed}} {{to solve the problem}} of containing water, mostly at the shower head end of the bathtub. Like the shower curtain, it dates back to the early 1900s.|$|E
50|$|Generally, shower <b>splash</b> <b>guards</b> {{are made}} from plastic and {{function}} as a dam to prevent water from escaping the bathtub and pooling on the floor. These devices are installed to fill the intersecting void between the top ledge of the bathtub and the perpendicular wall.|$|R

50|$|An underbone {{motorcycle}} {{is a small}} motorcycle {{built around}} a single tube frame called the underbone. This ‘underbone’ supports the whole vehicle and runs low all across {{the length of the}} motorcycle. There is a similarity in appearance to the scooter, largely due to the fuel tank position, the open-frame design which the fuel tank position allows and the <b>splash</b> <b>guards.</b> However, the entire power train, namely the engine position, power transmission and wheels are based on the design of conventional motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{about half}} of all burns were deemed preventable. Burn {{prevention}} programs have significantly decreased rates of serious burns. Preventive measures include: limiting hot water temperatures, smoke alarms, sprinkler systems, proper construction of buildings, and fire-resistant clothing. Experts recommend setting water heaters below 48.8 C. Other measures to prevent scalds include using a thermometer to measure bath water temperatures, and <b>splash</b> <b>guards</b> on stoves. While the effect of the regulation of fireworks is unclear, there is tentative evidence of benefit with recommendations including the limitation of the sale of fireworks to children.|$|R

50|$|Some gas griddles come {{equipped}} with a flame-failure safety device, but like many pieces of kitchen equipment, griddles can pose a fire hazard if not properly maintained. Care {{needs to be taken}} to keep the griddle and the area around it free of grease buildup. <b>Splash</b> <b>guards</b> {{at the edges of the}} griddle can help prevent grease from escaping to the surrounding workspace, and emptying the grease trough often helps prevent grease overflow. Additionally, because portable griddles are easily moved from one location to another, care must always be used to ensure that there is sufficient clearance between the griddle location and combustible materials. Also, common household griddles should not be located in a place where the heat control of the appliance would be accessible to children and others unfamiliar with the griddle's operation.|$|R

5000|$|Task Review: Phoenix {{came up with}} {{designs for}} a {{tabletop}} compost bin {{and a set of}} dish-washing gloves, and went for the former, especially when concerns were raised on the gloves after Adam gave misleading information on their popularity. The team faced problems with their pitches, with Duane being forced to step in and rescue their first one after Stephen was poorly received, yet managed to secure orders from both companies. Meanwhile, Sterling came up with designs for a bathtub <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> and a tap cozy, and went with the former idea after raising concerns on the ease of creating the cozy. Like the men, they also had issues with their pitches; in particular Laura proved to be bad, while the team received strong criticism for incorrect costing and Jane's bizarre attempt sell them one million units. In the end, the women only got orders from Amazon, yet despite it being larger than the men's, it could do nothing to prevent them losing the task.|$|E
50|$|Brothers Pete and Ernie Harris {{established}} their manufacturing business, Harris Manufacturing, in the 1940s and 50's. While {{looking for a}} way to expand their business, inspired by an increasing number of individuals building early pontoon boats on 55-gallon barrels and drop tanks from airplanes, the brothers founded Harris FloteBote Marine in 1957.The original Harris FloteBote pontoons were 20-feet in length with steel tubes. Dealers were not receptive to the large boats occupying the extra showroom space, as they were accustomed to typical 16-foot runabouts. In order to gain visibility in the marine industry the Harris brothers would showcase their boats first hand to people around Eastern Indiana and South-eastern Michigan lakes. This tactic successfully built a positive reputation through word-of-mouth. Harris FloteBote revamped the early pontoon boat industry in the 1960s by installing upholstered pontoon seats and furniture on their pontoon boats.Harris Flotebote adopted aluminum tubes around 1968, when welding equipment big enough to accommodate the material became available. In the 1970s Harris Flotebote pontoons were early adopters of sterndrives, and had motor-pods capable of holding engines as powerful as 140 horsepower—which enabled Harris Pontoons to pull water-skiers, an early innovation for pontoon boats. The <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> added to the front of the pontoons, referred to as a “dolphin-nose cone” were implemented in 1959, this design feature has become standard within the industry.In 2005 Harris-Kayot was purchased by Brunswick Corporation.To meet market demand, Brunswick Fort Wayne Operations, the producer of Harris FloteBote expanded their production facility in June 2013 to a 360,000-square foot manufacturing campus in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Harris FloteBote pontoons will have been produced in the region for over 50 years.|$|E
50|$|The Canadian {{version of}} the Yaris sedan, {{is based on the}} US-market Yaris S with power and {{all-weather}} guard packages, but with standard 14 in wheels. The regular CE, LE, and RS trims used in the Canadian Yaris hatchback are replaced in the Yaris sedan by option packages of B, C, D, or Aero types. The B adds 15 in all-season tires, chrome trim on the decklid, front and rear <b>splash</b> <b>guards,</b> colour-keyed door handles, blacked-out side window frames, keyless entry and power door locks; the C adds ABS, air conditioning, power windows, colour-keyed mirrors and power mirrors; the D adds both side and side-curtain airbags; the Aero adds alloy wheels, wheel locks, a rear spoiler, and a body kit. The Aero, however, has neither air conditioning nor side airbags. The Canadian model lacks the two-tone interior, pseudo-metallic trim on the door panels, and the new audio system controls (instead it uses an old design) found on the Japanese and American models.|$|R
50|$|The city of New Orleans had the {{official}} reopening date on Thursday (Sept. 4), after crews had restored most electric power and other services.Damage assessments came as residents returned to inspect their properties.

The all-wheel drive could be implemented by a button on the dash, and a complex and modern electro-pneumatic system allowed, four-wheel drive off, leaving firm transmission shaft and rear axle shafts, the pull was inserted by pressing the button, the engine is running and the car is stopped or at least at speeds below 55 km/h, where the traction was inserted over this speed, the wheel would fit only slowing below 55 km/h and also to prevent accumulation of ice, mud or snow clogging the system actuators of the transmission control, it was automatically inserted by turning off the engine. It was easy to recognize the 4WD thanks to the large lateral fascia of plastic material, the wheel rims of a specific design without any hub caps, and the front and rear splash guard; to distinguish it further unique identification was written on the tailgate, on the side shields and the <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> as standard. Inside was a novel covered steering wheel. The standard package included: a right external mirror, optional headlamp cleaning system, instrumentation and control system with tachometer, sunroof, electric windows, central locking, split rear seat, and a steering wheel adjustable for height. The Y10 4WD had a top speed of 145 km/h and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 17.4 seconds.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{demonstrate}} nonstructural hazard mitigation to the industrial community surrounding San Jose State University. A Materials Processing Laboratory which has {{a wide variety of}} experimental equipment was retrofitted in three phases. In Phase I the doors of all wall mounted cabinets were retrofitted with positive lock latches. Lighter equipment and computers placed on laboratory benches were restrained during Phase II. Equipment with low aspect ratios were placed on friction pads, whereas equipment with high aspect ratios were restrained to the countertop or the <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> with adhesive joints. In Phase III the heavier floor mounted equipment had custom brackets fabricated from Grade A 36 steel flat bars and were anchored to the concrete slab floor with threaded rod anchors installed with a two-part adhesive. Replacement cost of equipment was compared to the mitigation cost. Future work on calculating benefit cost ratios (BCR) is planned. Tours will be provided for engineering students and industry personnel to demonstrate the various approaches to nonstructural hazard mitigation and its benefits...|$|E
40|$|The hazard of scrotal cancer from cutting oils {{was first}} {{recognized}} in the 1950 s, and led to various control measures including the introduction of solvent refined oils, use of <b>splash</b> <b>guards,</b> provision of protective clothing and washing facilities and education of workers to encourage early detection and treatment of tumours. To assess how effective these controls have been, we have analyzed occupational mortality from scrotal cancer in England and Wales during 1979 - 80 and 1982 - 90. Over this 11 -year period 85 deaths were attributed to the disease in men aged 20 - 74. This represents a reduction in mortality from the 1960 s. Significantly elevated proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were found in press and machine tool setters (PMR 1, 678, five deaths), centre lathe turners (PMR 1, 099, three deaths) and machine tool operators (PMR 303, eight deaths), {{but all of the}} metal machinists who died of scrotal cancer had been born before 1930, and could have worked with cutting oils before controls were introduced. These findings are reassuring, but continued monitoring of scrotal cancer incidence and mortality is required...|$|R
