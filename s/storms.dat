5|$|The {{following}} {{names were}} used for named <b>storms</b> (tropical <b>storms</b> and hurricanes) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1956. <b>Storms</b> were named Anna, Betsy, Carla, Dora, Ethel, Flossy and Greta {{for the first time}} in 1956.|$|E
5|$|After {{the season}} began, Dr. Gray {{announced}} he had revised his predictions slightly downwards on August6, citing mild El Niño conditions. His new forecast was thirteen named <b>storms,</b> seven hurricanes, and three reaching major hurricane intensity. On August10, NOAA released an updated prediction as well, with a 90% probability of above-to-near normal activity, {{but the same}} number of <b>storms</b> forecast. CSU issued another forecast on September3, indicating sixteen tropical <b>storms,</b> eight hurricanes, and five major hurricanes. The season ended up with sixteen tropical depressions, fifteen named <b>storms,</b> nine hurricanes, and six major hurricanes, which matched CSU's final prediction on October1.|$|E

5|$|Although {{extrapolated}} {{peak maximum}} sustained winds based on whatever reports are available exist for every storm in 1860, estimated minimum central barometric air pressure listings are only {{present for the}} three <b>storms</b> that made landfall in the United States.

5|$|Although {{more common}} since 1995, few above-normal {{hurricane}} seasons occurred during 1970–94. Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to 1960, including many major New England hurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical <b>storms</b> formed in 1933, a record only recently exceeded in 2005, which saw 28 <b>storms.</b> Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900–25; however, many intense <b>storms</b> formed during 1870–99. During the 1887 season, 19 tropical <b>storms</b> formed, {{of which a}} record 4 occurred after November 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however, many struck in the early 19th century, including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on New York City. Some historical weather experts say these <b>storms</b> may have been as high as Category 4 in strength.|$|E

5|$|Drier {{parts of}} the country are highly prone to dust <b>storms.</b> These include areas west of Buenos Aires, which can average more than eight dust <b>storms</b> per year, and parts of Patagonia, owing to its aridity and windy climate. Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone to dust <b>storms</b> owing to {{extensive}} areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that erode the rock, which becomes a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind. Dust <b>storms</b> are more frequent during droughts, particularly in agricultural areas. Dust <b>storms</b> can effect large areas, leading to numerous impacts. These dust <b>storms</b> can lead to loss of crop and livestock, affecting the local economy. Productive topsoil may be lost during dust <b>storms,</b> leading to loss in soil productivity, which can increase soil erosion and negatively affect crop productivity in the long term. In addition to the impact on agriculture, dust <b>storms</b> can damage cars and buildings, lower visibility on roads, affect air quality, and affect water quality in rivers and lakes.|$|E
5|$|During the season, three hurricanes {{developed}} from five named <b>storms.</b> This was below {{the average of}} 10storms per season, and represented the fewest tropical <b>storms</b> since 1939. Four of the five <b>storms</b> {{developed from}} the intertropical convergence zone. The decreased activity is partially due to the westerlies extending further south than usual, {{as well as a}} persistent ridge. In addition, temperatures in the eastern United States were cooler than usual. Activity through September10 was the quietest in 30years.|$|E
5|$|During the year, a {{total of}} 17tropical cyclones, 15tropical <b>storms,</b> six {{hurricane}}s and two major hurricanes formed.

It was the second on record in which an Atlantic hurricane, Felix, and an eastern Pacific hurricane, Henriette, made landfall on the same day.

5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC).

Neither CSU or WRC issued a forecast on the number of major hurricanes, which are Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. In early 1985, WRC predicted 8named <b>storms</b> and 5hurricanes. The CSU forecast for April 1985 was 11named <b>storms</b> and 8hurricanes. This forecast was not revised in June.
