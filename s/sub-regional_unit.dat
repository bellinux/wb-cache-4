40|$|Renal {{services}} {{have been given}} priority {{in recent years in}} an attempt to align them with levels of provision in other European countries. A survey of patients receiving renal replacement therapy in the Northern Ireland Regional Centre, Belfast, was carried out to ascertain their views on services (survey I). After the establishment of a Northern Health and Social Services Board (NHSSB) <b>sub-regional</b> <b>unit</b> in 1995, the survey was repeated for patients attending the new unit (survey II). In survey 1, 53 % NHSSB patients responded. Travelling time to and from hospital was a major issue for the majority of patients, with 33 % of haemodialysis patients receiving twice weekly treatment unwilling to attend more frequently, even if clinically advised to do so. In survey 11, 60 % of patients responded. Travel times to the <b>sub-regional</b> <b>unit</b> were significantly shorter and patients felt it provided a similar or better standard of service, compared with the regional centre. All the twice weekly haemodialysis patients would increase to thrice weekly if clinically advised to do so. The study underlines the importance of locating dialysis facilities closer to patients' homes...|$|E

40|$|Ethiopia has {{an ethnic}} federal {{system that is}} based on the {{assumption}} that the ethnolinguistic communities of the country are located in neatly defined, or definable, territorial areas. On the basis of this assumption the federal system aspires to accommodate the ethnic diversity of the Ethiopian people through, principally, if not exclusively, territorial schemes. This assumption is, however, incorrect as far as urban areas are concerned which, despite being territorially enclosed within one of the ethnic-based regions or <b>sub-regional</b> <b>units,</b> have thousands of multiethnic dwellers. The territorial scheme thus fails to cater to a large contingent of multiethnic urban dwellers. IBS...|$|R

40|$|This article aims {{to examine}} the ageing {{situation}} and social policy issues in the Osijek-Baranja County of eastern Croatia. Using historical evidence from census data, {{research suggests that the}} evolution of the ageing pattern has been mainly determined by such factors as development of the transport system, changes in political-territorial organisation, supply of jobs in the cities, deagrarianisation and a domestic war in the 1990 s. The increased importance of urban centres, through planned industrialisation and administrative centralisation, has accelerated and intensified rural-tourban migration. Consequently, the spatial pattern of structural ageing has been substantially affected. A significant variation was found in urban and rural areas and also within <b>sub-regional</b> <b>units.</b> The findings suggest that the evolution of spatial disparities in the ageing pattern is because of unplanned migration; spatial differences in the level of socio-economic development; the influence of tradition, such as higher fertility rates historically in some areas; and suburbanisation, notably around the city of Osijek. The article concludes that ageing is affecting the country's economic growth and the formal and informal social support systems, including the provision of resources for older citizens in the endangered areas...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his speech}} to the 26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), Leonid Brezhnev told the delegates that the main goal of the Eleventh Five - Year Plan was to {{transition}} the Soviet economy from extensive to intensive growth, and to further improve {{the standard of living}} by 18 - 20 percent by 1985. He also told the Congress that the 1979 economic reform, initiated by Alexei Kosygin, would be of major importance to the five-year plan's success. Other goals were halting migration from East to West and South to North as well as ensuring economic growth. By 1981 the majority of Soviet economic centers were located in underdeveloped areas, such as Siberia and Central Asia. According to the Soviet government, the solution was to reduce social differences in the republics, oblasts and <b>sub-regional</b> <b>units</b> - in Brezhnev's words to establish an [...] "effective demographic policy". However, according to the Soviet government, the socioeconomic development of the Soviet Republics had been evened out due to the altruism of the Russian people, such that developmental differences between republics were no longer a problem.|$|R
40|$|In {{the near}} future {{important}} changes in the administrative division of Poland will be implemented. Such a step is reasonable only when it brings about advantages which would otherwise be unavailable or hard to achieve. The structure of territorial division of the state should consist of socio-economic key regions arranged hierarchically. Such units should be of key character {{and they should have}} a distinct center of a given rank. Furthermore, they should have a high degree of density of population as well as of social, economic and cultural integration. Besides, they should be characterized by a considerable level of self-organization and they should have strong internal territorial links. Besides, each regional division should meet the criteria of adequacy and separation. The elements of such regional structure should be: (1) communes (gminy), as basic units of the regional structure of the state and basic territorial units of the socio-economic links of local character; (2) districts (powiaty), as <b>sub-regional</b> <b>units</b> consisting of communities, strongly linked with the sub-regional center; (3) regions (województwa), as the conglomeration of provinces, strongly linked with the regional centre. Any discussion on the number of units of the territorial division of the state has little sense before the appropriate research has been carried out. The territorial division should be accompanied by a clear determination of powers vested in particular units and by a considerable decentralization of the state powers (including the shifting of some central institutions to the regional level). The change of the territorial division of the state must be done simultaneously and in one stage, i. e., districts and regions (larger than they are today) must be created at the same time. It is a difficult and demanding task; therefore, it should be carefully prepared and its results should last for several decades.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the current paper is to provide {{a closer look at the}} {{processes}} of economic transition and integration in the Baltic Sea Region since the early 1990 s. Focal points are regional and sub-regional integrative processes with regard to trade and foreign direct investment. The crucial issue is to analyse three complementary aspects of integration of the BSR. The first is a critical assessment of the BSR as a region within the European economic system, as it has been sketched in various publications from the European Commission. Secondly the paper tries to evaluate whether the BSR constitutes a coherent functional economic region based on the analysis of economic flows within the region and to the outside. Finally, an attempt is made to identify <b>sub-regional</b> economic <b>units</b> within the BSR. Data for the paper is provided from two sources, an empirical study of trade in the Danish textile industy and a survey of foreign direct investment occurring among all countries in the Baltic Sea rim region in 2000. A special study is made of Nordic firms establishing operations in the Baltic countries. ...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{years after}} the {{organization}} 2 ̆ 7 s founding, an air of disappointment surrounds the WTO. The great promise of a global trade regime, dedicated {{to the principle of}} comparative advantage, seems to have stalled. The Doha Development Round, launched in 2001 in an attempt to redeem the disastrous Seattle Ministerial Conference of 1999, has been stymied by familiar disputes between North and South, mostly with respect to agricultural issues, but with respect to nonagricultural market access and services as well. Frustrated by impasses at the WTO, members have increasingly bypassed the organization in favor of discrete 2 ̆ 2 preferential trade agreements 2 ̆ 2, or PTAs, that address trade issues in regional and <b>sub-regional</b> <b>units.</b> According to critics, these PTAs are creating a 2 ̆ 2 spaghetti bowl 2 ̆ 2 of trade regimes that threatens to make the global organization irrelevant. The dissatisfaction extends even to dispute settlement, long seen as the WTO 2 ̆ 7 s major contribution to international law. Although the DSU has had some notable successes, particularly in comparison to the often desultory GATT dispute settlement mechanism, commentators have voiced concerns. For example, one hears complaints that the retaliation remedy is too lenient, particularly in the context of asymmetric disputes between large and small economies; 2 ̆ 7 there are proposals to cure this problem by allowing for monetary compensation as a remedy. Commentators denounce the idea that members can violate their treaty obligations indefinitely—that members have the option to 2 ̆ 2 breach 2 ̆ 2 or to 2 ̆ 2 buy out 2 ̆ 2 their victims by accepting retaliation. Still others argue that the Appellate Body should be more willing to supplement WTO treaty text with other substantive international law, including customary international law. The Sutherland Report—more properly, the Report by the Consultative Board on The Future of the WTO—reflects this sense of unease about the organization 2 ̆ 7 s apparent drift. While affirming that the WTO represents 2 ̆ 2 the most dramatic advance in multilateralism 2 ̆ 2 since the 1940 s, the Report worries that the organization 2 ̆ 2 is not by any means fully equipped 2 ̆ 2 for the tasks ahead. To remedy this situation, the Report makes numerous recommendations {{in a wide variety of}} areas. The language is moderate in tone and the proposals mostly moderate in scope; the authors clearly understood the dangers of a radical transformation of the organization. And, as one would expect in a work done by committee, there are some tensions in the Report; its endorsement of plurilateral negotiations, for example, seems a bit at odds with its condemnation of PTAs. But one can fairly say that several important elements of the Report tend in the direction of strengthening the WTO as an institution, of making it a more independent and less 2 ̆ 2 Member-driven 2 ̆ 2 body. Reaction within the WTO membership has been tepid. There is little chance that the General Council will consider the Report before the end of the Doha Round, which could mean indefinite postponement. This lack of enthusiasm is not all that surprising. Enhancing the rigor of the WTO as an institution seems unlikely to solidify members 2 ̆ 7 commitment to the organization. On the contrary, increasing the demands of WTO membership—for example, by enlarging the organization 2 ̆ 7 s scope and making its rulings more binding—seems more likely, at this point, to result in greater suspicion and resistance. Empowering the WTO in some of the ways that the Report suggests could actually retard, rather than advance, the cause of freer global trade...|$|R
