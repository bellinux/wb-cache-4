We jointly estimate a translog cost function, a variable factor share equation and price-cost margin equations to analyze the effect of persistence in export activity on margins. Results indicate that non-exporters have smaller margins than persistent exporters and firms that entered foreign markets during the nineties. However, larger export ratio is negatively associated with margins <b>for</b> persistent <b>exporters.</b> It suggests that efficiency advantages <b>for</b> <b>exporters</b> are partially compensated by higher competitive pressure in international markets.
