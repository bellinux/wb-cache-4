50|$|It is {{estimated}} that over 70 media channels covered the engagements, with the top three positioned squads automatically qualifying to represent the continent for the 2010 World Championship, to be held from August 28 to September 12, in Turkey. This historic event also coincides with ongoing celebratory activities marking the 40th anniversary of Libya's 1 September Revolution (Great Al-Fatih Revolution) which brought Muammar Gaddafi to power, and the tenth anniversary of the <b>Sirte</b> <b>Declaration</b> establishing the African Union (AU) on September 9, 1999.|$|E

50|$|However, {{following}} {{the return of}} democracy to Nigeria in 1998 {{and the return of}} President Obasanjo to power, the idea was resurrected and President Obasanjo obtained the support of leaders from across Africa for its introduction into the work of the Organisation for African Unity. The OAU Council of Ministers was tapped to work on this and in June 2000, the Assembly of Heads of States and Government meeting in Lomé, Togo, adopted the CSSDCA Solemn Declaration, which ultimately brought the whole process into the focus of what would become the Africa Union. The CSSDCA was reintroduced at the same Summit in which the <b>Sirte</b> <b>Declaration</b> that motivated the Union was launched. Thus the processes were intertwined in a manner that gave the CSSDCA a preeminent in the continent’s bid to articulate a new direction and a more positive vision of development based on democratic reforms and the active involvement of civil society.|$|E
5000|$|The Abuja Treaty and <b>Sirte</b> <b>Declaration</b> {{called for}} the {{creation}} of a PAP. The former had simply listed the PAP among the organization's bodies and stated, [...] "In order to ensure that the peoples of Africa are fully involved in the economic development and integration of the Continent, there shall be established a Pan-African Parliament. The composition, functions, powers and organisation of the Pan-African Parliament shall be defined in a Protocol providing thereof." [...] The Treaty on the Establishment of the African Union and a Protocol to the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community relating to the Pan-African Parliament followed. Then there was the Constitutive Act of the African Union. The Protocol Establishing the Pan African Parliament was adopted in 2000 during the OAU Summit in Lomé, Togo. The Protocol is now open for signature and ratification. So far 21 member states have signed and three have ratified. Article 22 of the PAP protocol provides for the Protocol to enter into force after deposit of the instruments of ratification by a simple majority of the member states.|$|E
5000|$|Its origins are the Union of African States, {{an early}} {{confederation}} that {{was established by}} Haile Selassie and Kwame Nkrumah in the 1960s, as well as subsequent attempts to unite Africa, including the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), which was established on May 25, 1963, and the African Economic Community in 1981. Critics argued that the OAU in particular did little {{to protect the rights}} and liberties of African citizens from their own political leaders, often dubbing it the [...] "Dictators' Club". The idea of creating the AU was revived in the mid-1990s under the leadership of Libyan head of state Muammar al-Gaddafi: the heads of state and government of the OAU issued the <b>Sirte</b> <b>Declaration</b> (named after Sirte, in Libya) on September 9, 1999 calling for the establishment of an African Union.

40|$|Genocide in Rwanda {{represents}} a significant historical milestone on global and regional level. The events in Rwanda in 1994 caused deaths of approximately {{one million people}} and showed that the international community's passivity towards ongoing genocide led African leaders {{to believe that the}} resolution of conflicts on the continent is primarily their responsibility. The Organisation of African Unity, as a key organisation unifying African states, was the best institutional instrument to ensure continental safety. However, the organisation faced several problems, so the <b>Sirte</b> <b>Declaration</b> on the establishment of the African Union was accepted in 1999 to replace the existing Organisation of African Unity. In 2002, the organisation's first official summit was held. The thesis examines the extent to which Rwandan genocide has influenced the development of the African Union, in particular on the issue of access to security and the concept of state sovereignty. Rwandan genocide is treated as an exogenous shock and a historical milestone, which has significantly influenced the thinking of changing the approach to conflict resolution and the concept of sovereignty. The theoretical framework of thesis is formed by a constructivist conception of sovereignty and an exogenous shock that completes the overall [...] ...|$|E
