We then prove that the sign of any − 1 / 1 polynomial with ≤ s monomials in 2 n variables disagrees with Inner Product in ≥ Ω(1 /s) fraction of inputs, a type of result that seems unknown in the rigidity setting. Valiant’s rigidity problem [Val 77] asks to build explicit matrixes that are far in Hamming distance from low-rank matrixes. Valiant proved that if an N × N matrix M has hamming distance ≥ N 1 +Ω(1) from any matrix of rank R = (1 − Ω(1)) N, then the corresponding linear transformation x ↦ → Mx requires circuits of superlogarithmic depth or superlinear size. Exhibiting an explicit such matrix remains a long-standing challenge. Despite significant efforts, the best lower bounds are of the form (N 2 /R) lg(N/R) against matrixes of rank R.

40|$|Introduction: We {{propose that}} active Bayesian {{inference}} – a general framework for decision-making – can equally {{be applied to}} interpersonal exchanges. Social cognition, however, <b>entails</b> <b>special</b> challenges. We address these challenges through a novel formulation of a formal model and demonstrate its psychological significance. Method: We review relevant literature, especially with regards to interpersonal representations, formulate a mathematical model and present a simulation study. The model accommodates normative models from utility theory and places them within the broader setting of Bayesian inference. Crucially, we endow people's prior beliefs, into which utilities are absorbed, with preferences of self and others. The simulation illustrates the model's dynamics and furnishes elementary predictions of the theory. Results: 1. Because beliefs about self and others inform both the desirability and plausibility of outcomes, in this framework interpersonal representations become beliefs {{that have to be}} actively inferred. This inference, akin to 'mentalising' in the psychological literature, is based upon the outcomes of interpersonal exchanges. 2. We show how some well-known social-psychological phenomena (e. g. self-serving biases) can be explained in terms of active interpersonal inference. 3. Mentalising naturally entails Bayesian updating of how people value social outcomes. Crucially this includes inference about one’s own qualities and preferences. Conclusion: We inaugurate a Bayes optimal framework for modelling intersubject variability in mentalising during interpersonal exchanges. Here, interpersonal representations are endowed with explicit functional and affective properties. We suggest the active inference framework lends itself to the study of psychiatric conditions where mentalising is distorted...|$|R

Posebno se analiziraju elementi prema kojima se maksimalna hipoteka razlikuje od fiksne hipoteke. Razrađuju su specifičnosti i podvrste maksimalne hipoteke te posebno kontinuirana hipoteka. Maximum amount {{mortgage}} is a subtype {{of mortgage}} for the securing, {{to the maximum}} amount, {{of one or more}} claims whose total amount is not specified at the moment of concluding a mortgage loan contract, but can be specified. It is used for securing claim(s) whose total amount cannot be known at the moment of entering into contract so an approximate amount is stipulated instead. Maximum amount mortgages are mostly characterised by their connection to a specifiable claim. This way they derogate to a substantial degree two traditional principles of security interests on real property: accessoriness (by securing future planned and possible claims) and speciality (at the moment of placing a mortgage lien the claim is not specified, but is specifiable). Certainly, these <b>special</b> characteristics <b>entail</b> differences in relation to the so-called fixed-rate mortgage. This primarily pertains to the stage in which the mortgage is created both in terms of the contents of the mortgage contract and entry into the cadastral register. Unspecifiedness and the maximum possible amount of claim guaranteed by a maximum mortgage are its main peculiarities. The amount of claim can remain unspecified for a longer period, even {{for as long as the}} mortgage is “concealed”, i. e. during the pre-settlement phase. However, in the settlement phase the amount of claim, paid from the value of the mortgaged property, can no longer remain unspecified, at least in terms of the principal. Maximum mortgage is usually constituted as a guarantee mortgage, a credit mortgage, or as one of the two variants of the continuous-repayment mortgage. It can also be constituted as one of the following: a mortgage for own or another’s debt; annuity mortgage; mortgage on state-owned property; joint mortgage; mortgage on civil fruits; submortgage; public notary mortgage (on the basis of an agreement between parties); public notary mortgage on a vessel or an aeroplane or a yacht on the basis of an agreement between parties; mortgage on the basis of a directly enforceable public notary act; mortgage on a property under construction, etc...|$|R
