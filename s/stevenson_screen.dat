5000|$|This goal of {{this project}} {{is to have a}} diverse and {{widespread}} documentation of adolescence. The idea has been to chronicle the lives of children, for 5000 days (roughly 13.6895 years). The original goal was to create a [...] "personal time capsule" [...] for children 5-18, for them, and others to look back on. The project began with Rick <b>Stevenson</b> <b>screening</b> hundreds of kids near his hometown, Shoreline, WA in 2001. The project eventually began, with roughly 60 kids, where many of these kids are still a part of the project.|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} {{incentives}} for developing passive air sampling techniques for {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs). This paper reports on studies to further calibrate and optimize semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) for use as “integrated” air samplers of gas-phase POPs. These samplers are deployed over weeks/months/years. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were used as the test compounds in this study, with three specific objectives: (i) to determine whether ambient wind speed limits the rate of uptake during typical deployment conditions; (ii) to monitor uptake and SPMD−air equilibrium {{for a range of}} compounds; and (iii) to assess the application of performance reference compounds (PRCs) in air sampling, to “correct” for site-specific differences in uptake rates. When deployed in <b>Stevensons</b> <b>screens</b> under ambient conditions, wind speed did not significantly affect uptake rates. Rather, differences in summer/winter uptake rates reported previously, using the same deployment devices as here, are due to temperature affecting compound permeability through the membrane. Results from the use of PRCs indicate that SPMDs should be spiked prior to exposure with a range of compounds that are not present in the atmosphere, so that uptake rates can be estimated from depuration rates during a particular deployment. Short-term deployments (e. g. days; few weeks) would need to use compound(s) with a low octanol:air partition coefficient (KOA) (e. g. 13 C 12 labeled PCB- 28); long-term deployments (of many months to years) would need to use intermediate KOA compounds (e. g. 13 C 12 PCB- 101; 13 C 12 PCB- 153) ...|$|R

40|$|Observations {{of marine}} air {{temperature}} (MAT) by Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) {{are known to}} contain significant biases due to solar heating of the sensor environment. MAT and humidity observations are usually made using wet- and dry-bulb thermometers housed in <b>Stevenson</b> <b>screens,</b> or with psychrometers. These instruments are typically mounted in the bridge wings or on the wheel-house top. If not sited carefully then the instruments can be poorly exposed to the undisturbed environmental conditions and have inadequate ventilation, leading to biased observations of both MAT and humidity. In this paper we use observations collected {{as part of the}} VOS Climate (VOSClim) project to investigate the relationship between instrument exposure and heating errors. The heating errors are estimated as the difference between the observed MAT and the collocated output of a numerical weather prediction model. The instrument exposures are assessed from hotographs of the instruments. Currently, photographs of the instruments and sufficient observations exist for 17 VOSClim ships. Two methods of assessing the instrument exposure using the observations are presented. The first method is based on the skewness of the distribution of estimated heating errors for individual ships. The second method is based on a correction developed to correct the heating errors and uses the ratio of the heating to cooling terms in the correction. When ships are ranked both on the skewness and on the ratio of the heating to cooling terms, there is a statistically significant correspondence between the rankings and the visual assessments of instrument exposure. The skewness of the distribution of estimated errors in MAT is proposed as a simple indicator of instrument exposure...|$|R

40|$|This film {{is made up}} of five panoramas, four {{wide and}} one close-up, of the ruins of {{downtown}} San Francisco shortly after the 1906 disaster, plus a panorama and scene in a nearby refugee camp. Original intertitles precede each change of scene, but the locations provided are incorrect for three of the five views. The state of the ruins and camp suggest a date in late April, 1906. The absence of streetcar tracks in the "Grand Avenue" panorama dates that segment to before May 1, 1906. The following is a scene-by-scene description of the film: [Frame: 0103 (part 1) ] Intertitle: "Panorama of City Hall from Top of U. S. Mint. " In fact, this right-to-left (north-to-northwest) panorama of the ruined City Hall was filmed from the east side of 8 th Street at Market Street. For another description of essentially the same view (in reverse pan) see Scenes in San Francisco, No. 2. The principal features seen here are [0219 (part 1) ] the Hall of Records, [0655 (part 1) ] the east wing, [1020 (part 1) ] Marshall Square with the Pioneer Monument in front of the ruined City Hall cupola, [1327 (part 1) ] the ruined southwest wing, and [1602 (part 1) ] Market Street (note the elaborate street lamp). Because City Hall stood back from Market Street on a parallel street, ruins can be seen in front of parts of City Hall. In July 1993, in a spectacular engineering feat, the 1000 -ton Pioneer Monument was moved in one piece {{to the site of the}} City Hall cupola on the (future) Fulton Street mall. The move makes room for a corner of San Francisco's new Main Library. [1724 (part 1) ] Intertitle: "Panorama of Mission Street. " This jerky segment is a right-to-left (northeast-to-west) panorama filmed from the north side of Mission Street between 6 th and 7 th streets, a block south of Market Street. [1821 (part 1) ] The camera looks northeast down Mission Street. The twin chimneys of the U. S. Mint (one smoking) at 5 th Street are at center right. Beyond them and in the center of the picture is the Call Building tower on Market Street. [1926 (part 1) ] The Flood Building at Market and Powell streets is seen in the background. The ruins of the Hale Brothers Department Store rise in the background at Market and 6 th streets. In the far distance at left is the Fairmont Hotel on Nob Hill. Note the steps in the foreground leading nowhere; a common sight in the ruined city. [2205 (part 1) ] A small break in the continuity occurs here. [2424 (part 1) ] The arch-windowed ruin on Jessie Street between Mission and Market streets is the Swedish Evangelical Mission Church, founded in 1877 and built on this site circa 1900. The heart of the city's Scandinavian neighborhood lay several blocks further west. [2695 (part 1) ] The distant ruined tower of St. Boniface Church (1902) rises beyond the classic facade of the ruined Hibernia Bank (1892) at McAllister and Jones streets, at Market Street. [3057 (part 1) ] We see the north (Stevenson Street) wing of the U. S. Post Office (1905) at 7 th and Mission streets, and a lower central part of the building behind a boundary wall. Built on a buried marsh, the building was damaged in the 1906 and 1989 earthquakes. It was recently restored to serve as a court building for the U. S. Court of Appeals. [3192 (part 1) ] Intertitle: "Panorama [of] Market Street, San Francisco, from Top of U. S. Mint. " This segment was actually filmed from the first floor of the ruined California Casket Company Building located near the Mint on the south side of Mission Street between 5 th and 6 th Streets. The segment is a right-to-left (north-northwest-to-west) pan. [3290 (part 1) ] At far right is the Flood Building, with the northwest corner of the Mint in the foreground. At distant center is the Saint Francis Hotel on Powell street and the Alexander Hotel behind it (left). The narrow tower at left is the Press Club Building on Ellis Street. Far beyond it on Nob Hill are the Flood mansion (left) and the Fairmont Hotel (right). [3606 (part 1) ] Popular Zinkand's Cafe had occupied the ground floor of the building reduced to the dramatic brick spires seen here behind a foreground ruin. [3941 (part 1) ] The towers of ruined apartment buildings and hotels are seen along Turk Street across Market Street. Note the man searching through rubble in the foreground. [4327 (part 1) ] The ruins of Hale Brothers Department Store at Market and 6 th Streets fill the <b>screen.</b> <b>Stevenson</b> Street is in the foreground. [4880 (part 1) ] The ruins of St. Boniface Church are in the background. [5384 (part 1) ] At right center are an east-wing tower of City Hall and the adjacent dome of the Hall of Records. The Grant Building at 7 th and Market streets hides the City Hall cupola. At left is the U. S. Post Office at 7 th Street. Close to the camera and at left is the cornice of the California Casket Company Building. [Frame: 0102 (part 2) ] Intertitle: "Panorama from Grand Ave. " The correct name is Grant Avenue and the panorama was actually filmed almost a block southwest of Grant on Market Street near the Stockton and Ellis streets intersection. The first part of the segment is a right-to-left (northeast-to-west) pan. The second part is a slow, closeup pan moving left-to-right, of a ruined lot on the west side of Stockton Street north of Ellis Street. This site is also seen in the background near the end of the first pan in the segment. [0263 (part 2) ] Bicycle and pedestrian traffic on Market Street reflects the lack of public transportation before the beginning of streetcar service on May 1, 1906. [0396 (part 2) ] The Call Building tower at 3 rd and Market streets rises behind the Sorensen Jewelers Building. Beyond the Call Building are the Monadnock Building and the Palace Hotel. [0461 (part 2) ] A film assistant directs pedestrians out of the camera view. [0565 (part 2) ] The Mutual Savings Bank at Market and Kearny Streets is seen. [0850 (part 2) ] The view is of the rear wall of the elegant City of Paris Department Store, rebuilt on the site and now the location of Neiman-Marcus. [1946 (part 2) ] The unfinished frame of the Butler Building, now I. Magnin department store, is seen along Stockton Street at Geary Street, across from the City of Paris building. [2542 (part 2) ] The St. Francis Hotel and adjacent Alexander Hotel (left) rise in the background. Pedestrians are seen on Stockton Street and a work crew is busy in a lot across the street (see below). [3757 (part 2) ] The camera points up Ellis Street. The Flood Building stands on the left at Powell Street. The pan then drifts back up to Stockton Street. [Frame: 0100 (part 3) ] Intertitle: "Refugees in Jefferson Square. " This segment gives an excellent view of the informal, egalitarian atmosphere of a typical San Francisco earthquake refugee camp in the weeks following the earthquake and fire. Jefferson Square was and is a public park at the edge of the burnt area, a few blocks northwest of the ruined City Hall. One of the city's better run camps, it housed refugees from adjacent Hayes Valley. The park covers an area equal to four city blocks and is bounded by Laguna, Eddy and Gough streets, and Golden Gate Avenue. It is bisected by Turk Street and has a flat southern half (now Hayward Playground) and a sloping northern half in which this segment was filmed. The park is little changed today but the row of Victorian homes seen along Eddy Street is gone. The pan was filmed from right-to-left (east-to-north) on the curving central path near the west side of the park. The fixed view section was probably filmed further east along the same path, looking east from near the center of the park. [0244 (part 3) ] Note the " 102 " on the Army-issued umbrella tent. A couple are busy tightening the tent ropes. [0560 (part 3) ] Signs on a ramshackle structure suggest a possible public convenience. [1093 (part 3) ] Small cooking grates line the path. Note the strong afternoon west wind blowing through the trees and the soldier with a cold. A woman is seen cooking at her stove on the north side of the path. [2080 (part 3) ] A doctor, carrying his bag, pauses to look back. The woman with the polkadot blouse seems to be in charge of the grey tent at left, which may be a laundry. Note the homes on Eddy Street, north of the park, in the background. [2700 (part 3) ] An army officer gives some advice to a camp resident. [3100 (part 3) ] A man sits dozing, holding a newspaper. Washing hangs on nearby makeshift clotheslines. [3412 (part 3) ] The stationary view is of soldiers patrolling to keep order in a food line as approaching pedestrians dodge cooking grates on the path. Copyright: no reg.

50|$|Except {{for those}} {{instruments}} requiring direct {{exposure to the}} elements (anemometer, rain gauge), the instruments should be sheltered in a vented box, usually a <b>Stevenson</b> <b>screen,</b> to keep direct sunlight off the thermometer and wind off the hygrometer.

50|$|Other non-climatic {{changes can}} be caused by changes in {{measurement}} methods. Meteorological instruments are typically installed in a screen to protect them from direct sun and wetting.In the 19th century it was common to use a metal screen in front of a window on a North facing wall. However, the building may warm the screen leading to higher temperature measurements. When this problem was realized the <b>Stevenson</b> <b>screen</b> was introduced, typically installed in gardens, away from buildings. This is still the most typical weather screen with its characteristic double-louvre door and walls for ventilation. The historical Montsouri and Wilds screens were used around 1900 and are open to the North and to the bottom. This improves ventilation, but it was found that infra-red radiation from the ground can influence the measurement on sunny calm days. Therefore, they are no longer used. Nowadays automatic weather stations, which reduce labor costs, are becoming more common; they protect the thermometer by a number of white plastic cones. This necessitated changes from manually recorded liquid and glass thermometers to automated electrical resistance thermometers, which reduced the recorded temperature values in the USA.|$|E
