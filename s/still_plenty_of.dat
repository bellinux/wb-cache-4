Passenger rail cars and light rail vehicles often use disc brakes outboard of the wheels, which helps ensure a free flow of cooling air. However, on some modern passenger rail cars, such as the Amfleet II cars, inboard disc brakes are used. This reduces wear from debris, and also provides protection from rain and snow, which would make the discs slippery, and unreliable. However, there is <b>still</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> cooling for reliable operation. In contrast, some airplanes have the brake mounted with very little cooling and the brake gets quite hot in a stop, but this is acceptable as there is then time for cooling, and where the maximum braking energy is very predictable.|$|E

For instance, Puerto Aisén, at 45°24' south latitude, receives 2,973.3 millimeters of rain per year. However, unlike in Valdivia, the rain falls more or less evenly throughout the year in Puerto Aisén. The summer months average 206.1 millimeters, whereas the winter months average 300 millimeters. The temperatures at sea level in Puerto Aisén average 13.6°C in the summer months and 4.7°C in the winter months. Although the area generally is chilly and wet, the combination of channels, fjords, snowcapped mountains, and islands of all shapes and sizes within such a narrow space makes for breathtaking views. The area is still heavily forested, although some of the native species of trees that grow in the central and southern parts of the country have given way to others better adapted to a generally colder climate.|$|E

There were <b>still</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> women present on the battlefields to help rescue and nurse soldiers. Some women fought alongside their husbands and sons on the battlefield. The majority of women assumed supportive and non-competitive roles such as fundraising and caring for the sick. Revolution for women meant something different than for men. Women saw revolution as a way to earn equal rights, such as voting, and to overcome the suppression of subordination of women to men.|$|E

For example, as critic Jack Himelblau explains, [...] "Asturias [...] wrote his novel {{primarily}} with his compatriots in mind, who, undoubtedly, had lived through the tyranny of Estrada Cabrera from 1898 to 1920." [...] Estrada Cabrera was notorious for his brutal repression of dissent in Guatemala, and Asturias had been involved in protests against his rule in 1920. [...] Asturias integrated and reworked incidents from Estrada Cabrera's dictatorship into the novel, such as the torture of a political adversary, who had been tricked [...] "into believing that his innocent wife had been unfaithful to him".|$|E
500|$|Several critics praised {{this episode}} for its {{character}} development, {{something that they}} said was missing in the previous episodes. Robert Canning of IGN said that although there was <b>still</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> room for growth, the episode gave {{a better understanding of}} Liz and Jenna's friendship. He felt that prior to the episode, nothing was known about Liz and Jenna's longtime friendship, {{and that there was no}} depth to it. Canning said that Liz's admission of being somewhat jealous of Jenna's success was a much needed storyline for the show, and one that gave the audience something deeper to latch onto. However, Canning pointed out that small hints of what their friendship was like in the past were played for laughs as opposed to establishing any sort of history. Canning found that their verbal sparring really [...] "solidified their bond", and that by the end of the episode the audience had seen their [...] "human side" [...] and the [...] "characters had become people".|$|E

[...] Steven Tyler described Sanchez's performance as [...] "great" [...] while Randy Jackson noted that it was [...] "unbelievable, sensational".

He criticized the show's lack of continuity, particularly with regard to the Jesse and Rachel storyline. Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack also observed the lack of continuity in the Jesse storyline, calling it [...] "slightly confusing" [...] and [...] "a little half-baked"; continuity errors in his storyline may have been the result of the change in episode broadcast order. He felt that the episode was [...] "a slight let down", noting: [...] "There wasn’t as much tension as I would have hoped going into the finale but there were <b>still</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> fun moments to enjoy." [...] James Poniewozik of Time attributed part of the episode's problems to it being [...] "an episode that could air easily out of order", explaining: [...] "Glee is a very serial show, after all, but this episode largely consisted of moments that felt dropped in and random, in a way that undermined even the good moments." ...|$|E

[...] Journalist J.C. Maçek III of Spectrum Culture wrote [...] "The truth is that it might be easy to dismiss Slayer after almost 35 years as a nostalgic metal act. This would be a travesty and a mistake. Slayer not only has something new to say on Repentless, but a new way to say it." [...] AllMusic writer Thom Jurek gave the album three out of five stars, calling Repentless [...] "a retro, workmanlike effort from a band determined to soldier on, and that's fine. There are hardcore devotees who never want their favorite bands to change; this is for them. But again, given all that's transpired since 2009, Slayer get points for even pulling this off." [...] The Guardian stated that [...] "Slayer have always been a model of consistency and a band that fans of vicious, vein-bursting heavy metal can rely on."

[...] In his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Peter Travers criticized the casting choices for the Mexican roles, which included Banderas, a Spaniard, as well as Hopkins and Zeta-Jones, who are both Welsh. Disappointed with the film's entertainment value, Travers also expected the film to be a failure with audiences. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli compared the tone and style of The Mask of Zorro to producer Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark. [...] "While The Mask of Zorro isn't on the same level, it's not an altogether ridiculous comparison. Even though Zorro doesn't feature the non-stop cliffhanger adventure of Raiders," [...] Berardinelli continued, [...] "there's <b>still</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> action, tumult, and derring-do." [...] He was undecided whether the film would be a box office success, {{and that it would}} depend on the on-screen chemistry between Banderas and Zeta-Jones.

Philip Booth of The Tampa Tribune believed that the single was [...] "undulating [...] omnipresent" [...] {{not only in the}} alternative rock genre, but in pop music as a whole.

Nick Griffiths (Select) described the song as [...] "all mellow strumming and thoughtfully shallow vocals, though it's almost exonerated by a shrill unexpectedly choral middle eight." [...] Amy Hanson of Allmusic noted that the song has [...] "become {{an integral part of the}} 1990s alterna-landscape, and remains one of the purest diamonds that sparkle amongst the rough-hewn and rich funk chasms that dominate the Peppers' own oeuvre".
