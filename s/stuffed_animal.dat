An unknown {{woman in a}} bikini {{came out to the}} ringside area with some cookies, Coachman offered cookies to Eugene. The woman lured Eugene out of the ring and Eugene went over and grabbed some cookies. As Eugene went to grab more cookies, Coachman slammed Eugene's head into the cookie tray. A spot in the match saw Garrison Cade come out to ringside with a <b>stuffed</b> <b>animal,</b> which prompted Cade to tear up said toy animal. Cade tried to hold Eugene so Coachman could get the advantage, however, Eugene was able dodge the attack, as Coachman ended up hitting Cade instead. Eugene Rock bottomed Coachman and pinned him for the win.|$|E
5|$|Roughly a {{thousand}} {{years prior to the}} events of the series, Marceline was born to a demon lord named Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson) and a human woman (voiced by Rebecca Sugar). Abadeer is the ruler of the Nightosphere—a Hell-like demon dimension—and subsists on the souls of sentient beings. For some reason, Marceline was left abandoned on Earth in events immediately following the Mushroom War, a mysterious war that ravaged the earth one thousand years prior to events of the series. During this time, Simon Petrikov—the name of the Ice King before he was overcome by the evil power of his crown—found Marceline in the ruins of a city and gave her a <b>stuffed</b> <b>animal</b> named Hambo to cheer her up. The two developed a caring relationship, although the crown took a toll on Simon's mental health, forcing him to leave Marceline alone. During this period in her life, she was reunited with her father, only to be disgusted by his cold and heartless ways. Although she attempted to tolerate his evil and selfish antics, she eventually severed all ties with Abadeer after she discovered him eating fries that she had made for herself. In the following years, Marceline roamed the land of Ooo and eventually befriended a tribe of humans. She became their guardian and ally, and she helped them kill vampires, who had taken over much of the land. Marceline soon discovered that, upon killing a vampire, she was able to acquire their unique abilities thanks to her demonic power to absorb souls. However, when she tried to fight the Vampire King himself, she was bitten. Although she eventually managed to slay him, she was turned in the process. At some point, she began a romantic relationship with a magician named Ash. The two would move into the Tree Fort, but their relationship would come to an end. Presumably, around this time, Marceline befriended Princess Bubblegum, the sovereign of the Candy Kingdom; the two would often avoid official royal meetings and explore the Candy Kingdom's elaborate rock candy mining complex. Eventually, due largely to the mounting stress of running her kingdom, Bubblegum pushed Marceline away, leaving an animosity between the two that lasted for a while.|$|E
25|$|As a child, she {{was given}} a lifelike {{chimpanzee}} <b>stuffed</b> <b>animal</b> named Jubilee by her father; her fondness for the toy started her early love of animals. Today, the <b>stuffed</b> <b>animal</b> still sits on her dresser in London. As she writes in her book, Reason for Hope: “My mother’s friends were horrified by this toy, thinking it would frighten me and give me nightmares.” Goodall has a sister, Judith, who shares the same birthday, though the two were born four years apart.|$|E

25|$|An earlier survey, {{conducted}} from 1997 to 1998, reported about 2% of furry respondents stating {{an interest}} in zoophilia, and less than 1% {{an interest in}} plushophilia (sexually aroused by <b>stuffed</b> <b>animal</b> toys). The older, lower results, which are even lower than estimated in the general population, were due to the methodology of questioning respondents face-to-face, which led to social desirability bias. In contrast, one study showed 7.5% of college students reporting zoophilia, while other studies find only 2.2% to 5.3% expressing fantasies of sex with animals.|$|E
25|$|Pivotal {{response}} treatment (PRT) is a naturalistic intervention {{derived from}} ABA principles. Instead of individual behaviors, it targets pivotal areas of a child's development, such as motivation, responsivity to multiple cues, self-management, and social initiations; it aims for widespread improvements {{in areas that}} are not specifically targeted. The child determines activities and objects that will be used in a PRT exchange. Intended attempts at the target behavior are rewarded with a natural reinforcer: for example, if a child attempts a request for a <b>stuffed</b> <b>animal,</b> the child receives the animal, not a piece of candy or other unrelated reinforcer.|$|E
25|$|A {{person must}} be 21 {{years of age}} to gamble at a casino in New Jersey. It is legal for a minor {{to go to a}} casino, insofar as they do not gamble, consume {{alcoholic}} beverage, or remain on the gambling floor. Underage gambling at a casino is a disorderly persons offense (misdemeanor), punishible by a $500–$1000 fine and a mandatory six-month driver's license suspension, and plea bargaining of underage gambling charges is prohibited. The legal age for other forms of licensed gambling (e.g., lottery, horse race) is 18, but a person under 18 may take part in amusement games where the prize is an item (e.g., a <b>stuffed</b> <b>animal),</b> and not cash. There is no minimum age for social gambling.|$|E

25|$|Late on November 30, 1957, in Lincoln, Starkweather became {{angry at}} service station {{attendant}} Robert Colvert {{for refusing to}} sell him a <b>stuffed</b> <b>animal</b> on credit. He returned {{several times during the}} night to purchase small items, then finally, brandishing a shotgun, forced Colvert to hand over $100, then drove him to a remote area. After Colvert was injured during a struggle over the gun, Starkweather killed him with a shot to the head. He immediately confessed to Fugate that he had only robbed Colvert but that someone else had killed him. Fugate later told police that she did not believe Starkweather's story, but pretended to go along out of fear. Starkweather later claimed that after this first murder, he believed he had transcended his former self, reaching a new plane of existence in which he was outside the law and could commit any crime without guilt or fear of repercussion.|$|E

Later, after meeting Bi Ryu's Party she speaks slowly with future predictions, accurately predicting Yhun Ah-Rin kicking Bi Ryu. It is also known that she apparently is wanted, as a group of assassins intrude upon Bi-Ryu's party and attempt to kill them to take Nirvana. She seems to like Cho Ryung, as she hugs her like a <b>stuffed</b> <b>animal</b> a lot (She's also {{the only one who can}} understand what Cho Ryung says).

500|$|Many {{observers}} {{found the}} practice humorous. Luke Meredith, {{a writer for}} the Associated Press, wrote that it [...] "has already led to a few amusing moments where a coach, enraged with a call gone against his wrestler, had to reach for a tiny <b>stuffed</b> <b>animal</b> and fling it across the mat to get the referee's attention." [...] NBC Sports commentators for their Olympic coverage began referring to Vinicius as [...] "the challenge mascot." [...] Dustin Nelson, a news writer for the website Thrillist, wrote that the mascot took [...] "a little of the anger out of a challenge." [...] Jason Bryant, the in-house commentator for wrestling at the 2016 Olympics, was slightly surprised to see the practice at the Olympics, given the emphasis there on [...] "protocol", but he eventually commented that it does not matter what the challenge object is, particularly if it has cultural significance to the location of the competition. Coach Mike Maliconico argued that the practice does not belong at the Olympic Games, stating, [...] "The fate of one of my athletes who has been training for this specific moment for four years hangs in the balance of a referee's error.

500|$|According to the {{official}} police log, at 7:46 pm, a Haverhill police officer arrived at the scene. No one was inside or around the car. The impact had pushed the car's radiator into the fan, rendering it inoperable. [...] The car's windshield was cracked on the driver's side and both airbags had deployed. The car was locked. Inside and outside the car he discovered red stains that looked to be red wine. Inside the car the officer found an empty beer bottle and a damaged box of Franzia wine on the rear seat. In addition, he found a AAA card issued to Murray, blank accident-report forms, gloves, compact discs, makeup, diamond jewelry, two sets of MapQuest driving directions (one to Burlington, Vermont, another to Stowe, Vermont), Murray's favorite <b>stuffed</b> <b>animal,</b> and Not Without Peril, a book about mountain climbing in the White Mountains.

500|$|In {{regards to}} the miniseries' cynosural song [...] "Everything Stays", Nyström {{revealed}} that, during the storyboarding of the episode of the same name, she found herself unable to write a lullaby for the scene between Marceline and her mother. She relayed her issue to Muto, who contacted Sugar {{and asked if she}} would be willing to pen the song. Sugar agreed and based the song on an incident in which she lost a <b>stuffed</b> <b>animal</b> in a garden. A year later, she found it; the sun had bleached the exposed surfaces, but the underside was still the same. She explained, [...] " [...] wasn’t better, or worse, just different. It was the first time I realized that things will change no matter what, even if they’re left alone, and stay completely still." [...] Muto was excited to have Sugar return to work on the show, and noted at the 2015 Adventure Time San Diego Comic-Con International panel that [...] "because [...] was a Marceline miniseries, it wouldn't really feel complete unless Rebecca Sugar wrote a song for it." [...] At San Diego Comic-Con, Sugar and Olson performed the song live.|$|E
