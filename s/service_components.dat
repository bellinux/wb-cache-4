A business reference model is a means to describe the business operations of an organization, independent of the organizational structure that perform them. Other types of business reference model can also depict the relationship between the business processes, business functions, and the business areaâ€™s business reference model. These reference model can be constructed in layers, and offer a foundation for the analysis of <b>service</b> <b>components,</b> technology, data, and performance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>Service</b> <b>Component</b> Architecture (SCA) {{provides}} a platform-independent component model for service-oriented development. A <b>service</b> <b>component</b> with different communication mechanisms and implementation languages can be modeled in SCA. However, it lacks a formal foundation for SCA-based system specification and verification. This paper presents a formal <b>service</b> <b>component</b> signature model {{with respect to}} the specification of the SCA assembly model. Inspired by the idea of independence in SCA, a language-independent dynamic behaviour model is proposed for specifying the interface behaviour of the <b>service</b> <b>component</b> by port activities. Based on the dynamic behaviour model, the compatibility relation between components is discussed. A set of transition rules are given to map Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL) to dynamic behaviour expressions and then to Petri nets, thus the <b>service</b> <b>component</b> based system can be verified with existing tools. A case study is demonstrated to illustrate how to use our approach to constructing a web application in a rigorous way...|$|R
