It connects reciprocating piston to rotating crankshaft, transmitting {{the thrust of the}} piston to the crankshaft. Every vehicle that uses an internal combustion engine requires at least one connecting rod depending upon the number of cylinders in the engine. As the purpose of the connecting rod is to transfer the reciprocating motion of the piston into rotary motion of the crankshaft. Connecting rods for automotive applications are typically manufactured by forging from either wrought steel or powdered metal. They could also be cast. However, castings could have blow-holes which are detrimental from durability and fatigue points of view. The fact that forgings produce blow-hole-free and better rods gives them an advantage over cast rods (Gupta, 1993).

40|$|When {{performing}} knee arthroscopy, joint stressing {{is essential}} to increase the operative joint space. Adequate training of joint stressing is important, since high stressing forces can damage knee ligaments, and low stressing might not give sufficient operative space. As forces are difficult to transfer since they cannot be seen, simulators might be suited to train joint stressing as they can visualise the amount of applied stress. This requires the joint stressing thresholds to be validated. The {{purpose of this study}} was to measure the variation in the maximum joint stressing forces applied by various surgeons in vivo in a human population and based on that derive thresholds for <b>safe</b> <b>stressing.</b> From studies on ligament failure properties, we inferred a theoretical maximum stressing force of 78 N. Twenty-one patients were included, and knee arthroscopies were performed by five experienced surgeons. Forces solely performed in the varus and in valgus direction were measured. A load sensor was mounted on a belt, which was rotated along the hip to measure both varus and valgus stressing. The measurements started as soon as the interior of the knee joint was visualised using joint stressing. The average maximum stressing force was 60 N (SD = 28 N). The mean first frame force was 47 N (SD = 34 N). No significant differences were found between varus and valgus stressing. Since variation in stressing forces is high, offering training cases on simulators where the complete range of stressing forces can be experienced is recommended.

Most of the {{research has focused on}} optimum dynamic characteristics of rotor blades to reduce vehicle vibration. There is also work on optimization of aerodynamic performance and on composite structural design. This research has greatly increased our understanding of helicopter optimum design in each of these aspects. Helicopter design is an inherently multidisciplinary process involving strong interactions among various disciplines which can appropriately include aerodynamics; dynamics, both flight dynamics and structural dynamics; aeroelasticity: vibrations and stability; and even acoustics. Therefore, the helicopter design process must satisfy manifold requirements related to the aforementioned diverse disciplines. In our present work, we attempt to combine several of these important effects in a unified manner. First, we design a blade with optimum aerodynamic performance by proper layout of blade planform and spanwise twist.

Most manufacturing concerns spend more than a 60 % of their money for materials. The design of turbo machinery has been practiced {{in the last half}} of the previous century with increasing degree of sophistication. This trend of development is not complete because design of any turbo machine is interdisciplinary process involving aerodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, stress analysis, vibration analysis, the selection of materials, and the requirements for manufacturing. So, products have not reached a level of full maturity. Today there is considerable room for further development of most turbo machinery products when looked at with the perspective of the broadest possible design world and when it comes to development at the design stage then various types of analysis of every component are performed on computer before the first prototype is built. Among these the major one end the most frequently used in the manufacturing of any mechanical part is stress analysis. As the mass of the fan is directly related to the thickness of the impeller parts hence our objective in this project is to minimize the thickness, keeping in consideration the operating restrictions and design parameters. This work concentrates on to generate the finite element model of backward curved aerofoil radial fan impeller which behaves mathematically like structure model & carry out stress analysis using ANSYS software. The analysis was carried out using the default thickness of the impeller of the radial fan. This results in massive weight of the fan, leading to large vibrations and one of the reasons to failure. Ways were found out to reduce all these things, so the analysis was carried using various reduced thicknesses of the impeller and the optimum thickness of the impeller parts found for the <b>safe</b> <b>stress</b> and strain limits.

40|$|The {{training}} and ongoing education of medical practitioners has undergone {{major changes in}} an incremental fashion over the past 15 years. These changes have been driven by patient safety, educational, economic and legislative/regulatory factors. In the near future, training in procedural skills will undergo a paradigm shift to proficiency based progression with associated requirements for competence-based programmes, valid, reliable assessment tools and simulation technology. Before training begins, the learning outcomes require clear definition; any form of assessment applied should include measurement of these outcomes. Currently training in a procedural skill often takes place on an ad hoc basis. The number of attempts necessary to attain a defined degree of proficiency varies from procedure to procedure. Convincing evidence exists that simulation training helps trainees to acquire skills more efficiently {{rather than relying on}} opportunities in their clinical practice. Simulation provides a <b>safe,</b> <b>stress</b> free environment for trainees for skill acquisition, generalization and transfer via deliberate practice. The work described in this thesis contributes to a greater understanding of how medical procedures can be performed more safely and effectively through education. The effect of feedback, provided to novices in a standardized setting on a bench model, based on knowledge of performance was associated with an increase in the speed of skill acquisition and a decrease in error rate during initial learning. The timing of feedback was also associated with effective learning of skill. A marked attrition of skills (independent of the type of feedback provided) was demonstrable 24 hrs after they have first been learned. Using the principles of feedback as described above, when studying the effect of an intense training program on novices of varied years of experience in anaesthesia (i. e. the present training programmes / courses of an intense training day for one or more procedures). There was a marked attrition of skill at 24 hours with a significant correlation with increasing years of experience; there also appeared to be an inverse relationship between years of experience in anaesthesia and performance. The greater the number of years of practice experience, the longer it required a learner to acquire a new skill. The findings of the studies described in this thesis may have important implications for the trainers, trainees and training bodies in the design and implementation of training courses and the formats of delivery of changing curricula. Both curricula and training modalities will need to take account of characteristics of individual learners and the dynamic nature of procedural healthcare...|$|E
