50|$|Bacopa rotundifolia is {{a species}} of <b>water</b> <b>hyssop</b> known as the disk <b>water</b> <b>hyssop</b> or round-leafed <b>water</b> <b>hyssop,</b> due {{to the shape of}} its leaves. This is an aquatic plant native to water bodies of the central United States and well known in other areas as an {{invasive}} weed of waterways. The round leaves are 1 to 3 centimeters wide and each has six longitudinal veins. The plant produces yellow-throated white flowers. The plant is in bloom during the fall, its fruit/seed abundance is medium and its seed spread rate is slow. The plant has no commercial use.|$|R
50|$|Bacopa eisenii is {{a species}} of <b>water</b> <b>hyssop</b> known by the common name Gila River <b>water</b> <b>hyssop.</b> It is native to California and Nevada, where it grows in wet habitat such as rice paddies and muddy river banks. This aquatic plant has rounded or oval leaves 1 to 3 centimeters long with several {{longitudinal}} veins. The flower appears on a stout pedicel; it is white with a bright golden throat. The fruit is a capsule containing many seeds.|$|R
40|$|A {{sustainable}} {{process to}} produce herbal tea from Vietnamese <b>water</b> <b>hyssop</b> (Bacopa monnieri) has been conducted. The product {{can be used}} as traditional Ayuvedic medicinal herb. In this study, factors affecting drying process have been investigated including temperature ranging from 60 to 80 °C, material thickness from 0. 18 to 0. 54 g/cm 2 and air velocity from 0. 5 to 1. 5 m/s. Total polyphenols and soluble solid contents were observed during the process. Antioxidant capacity of raw and dried <b>water</b> <b>hyssop</b> have been also evaluated. The optimum result showed that at temperature of 60 °C, material thickness of 0. 18 g/cm 2 and air velocity of 1. 5 m/s, polyphenols content and total soluble solids in final herbal tea were found at 15. 13 mg/g gallic acid equivalent and 4. 00 %. With saponins concentrations of 0. 53 % and 0. 50 %, the IC 50 values of 3. 94 µg/ml and 4. 45 µg/ml were found in the raw and dried <b>water</b> <b>hyssop</b> tea, respectively. It’s required to dry <b>water</b> <b>hyssop</b> at optimum condition in 180 minutes and chop materials into 1 mm lengths before being used as herbal tea...|$|R

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>hyssop</b> (Bacopa monnieri L.) is an {{important}} medicinal plant due to its active compounds. The plant is also used in ornamental aquaria mainly due to its appearance and adaptability. This study reports on the adventitious shoot regeneration of <b>water</b> <b>hyssop</b> by culturing different internodes and leaf explants on MS media supplemented with various combinations of BA and NAA. All explants induced calli and shoots on all combinations of BA+NAA. The maximum number of shoots per explant on all explants was observed on MS medium supplemented with 0. 25 mg/l BA+ 0. 25 mg/l NAA. A higher concentration of NAA inhibited shoot regeneration with all concentrations of BA. Shoots obtained from leaf explants were longer than those from other explants. Regenerated shoots were successfully rooted on MS medium supplemented with IBA. Rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized in water of various pH levels between 4. 0 - 10. 00. It was found that plants can be established on slightly acidic to slightly alkaline media. However, pH 8. 0 {{was found to be}} more suitable for plant growth under aquatic conditions...|$|R

Brahmi contains bacoside A & B, Brahmin as main alkaloid and others are nicotine, herpestine. Bacoside A, B are the major constituents present in Brahmi plant in the form of saponins other than this D- mannitol, hersaponin and potassium salts are also present.   In this review we discuss primarily on pharmacological properties, chemical constituents and scientific researches supporting the  not only traditional use of Ayurvedic claims regarding Brahmi plant but also other physiological conditions such as anti-inflammatory, cardio tonic and other pharmacological effects of BM preparations/extracts.  </p...|$|R
