50|$|The {{team led}} by Dr. Niven {{is still in the}} {{maintenance}} tunnel of the LHC and they are at risk of being exposed to radiation. James and Connor try to shut down the LHC, but they are unsuccessful; the emergency <b>shutdown</b> <b>switch</b> is not working. The radiation alarm goes off and they decide to run away to avoid being exposed to the radiation. The elevator near the control room is not working and there is no mobile signal since they are over hundred meter underground. They decide {{to go down to the}} maintenance tunnel and James manually shuts down the LHC. Connor informs the group that the LHC cannot be turned on from the control room and neither do they have access rights to turn on the LHC. Since the LHC is now off, they can use the elevator in the maintenance tunnel to get out; they believe that the {{team led by}} Dr. Niven is dead due to radiation.|$|E
50|$|On the ship, the {{survivors}} discover metal beneath Reed's skin, {{causing him to}} begin questioning his existence. Ross reveals that Reed is {{actually one of the}} first TR-5s, planted in the community with Ross as his handler. Reed's memories are all implants based on Ross's own memories. Bronson (Dustin Harnish) becomes paranoid and believes the other survivors are also androids, but Chloe (Lauren Walsh) dispels him by revealing she is pregnant. At the space station, the group battles the TR-4s en masse, resulting in Bronson's death and Tiffany (Lucinda Rogers) becoming separated from the others. Ross attempts to shut down the TR-4s but the control console fights back, repeatedly locking him out. Suddenly, the TR-4s all shut down, and Ross ominously realizes their power is being funneled to a much worse problem - the giant TR-5 that caused the rebellion in the first place. The massive robot appears and kills Ross with a blade mounted in its arm after shrugging off his EMP weapon, then attacks Chloe. Reed appears and baits the TR-5 into an airlock, and Chloe ejects both it and Reed into outer space. The TR-4s come back to life despite Tiffany hitting the <b>shutdown</b> <b>switch,</b> but when she rips the cords from the control box, they all die simultaneously. Chloe, Tiffany, Tanner (Mark Hengst), Laura (Krystle Connor) and Chloe's unborn child are left as the only survivors, possibly of all humanity.|$|E
30|$|Simply described, in {{an acute}} inflammation, {{apoptotic}} arm or Yin responses are catabolic processes requiring high energy consumption from mitochondrial OxPhos to express death signals, oxidants, enzymes and receptor molecules for destruction {{of both the}} enemy and the injured/infected host cells. In contrast, the wound healing or Yang responses are anabolic processes and require simultaneous polarization of immune and non-immune cells for generation of growth promoting factors to counteract and neutralize the toxicity of injured tissue. Yang responses follow mitochondrial <b>shutdown</b> and <b>switch</b> to cytosolic low energy utilization from glycolysis (Warburg effect) to resolve inflammation.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} to adapt axial grooved designs to the gammit of heat pipe thermal control techniques, with {{particular emphasis on}} those suited for cryogenic applications was conducted. In addition to considering both active and passive gas control, diode designs utilizing liquid or gas blockage, or a liquid trap, are evaluated. The use of the liquid trap as a secondary heat pipe for forward mode operation during diode shutdown is also studied. This latter function is basically that of a thermal switch. Finally, a system capable of hybrid functions consisting of gas-controlled variable conductance and liquid trap diode <b>shutdown</b> or thermal <b>switching</b> is defined...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{and speed of}} execution have long been recognized as conflicting requirements for processor design. In this work, we have developed a low-cost dynamic architecture adaptation scheme to save leakage power in caches. This design uses voltage scaling to implement drowsy caches. The importance of a dynamic scheme for managing drowsy caches, arises {{from the fact that}} not only does cache behavior change from one application to the next, but also during different phases of execution within the same application. We discuss various implementations of our scheme that provide a tradeoff between granularity of control and design complexity. We investigate a combination of policies where the cache lines can be turned off completely if they are not accessed, when in the drowsy mode. We also develop a simple dynamic cache-way shutdown mechanism, and propose a combination of our dynamic scheme for drowsy lines, with the cache-way <b>shutdown</b> scheme. <b>Switching</b> off cache ways has the potential of greater energy benefits but provides a very coarse grained control. Combining this with the fine grained scheme of drowsy cache lines allows us to exploit more possibilities for energy benefits without incurring a significant degradation in performance.

30|$|The digital {{real-time}} simulation system can finish {{the power grid}} modeling and realize the simulation of electromagnetic transients of the HVDC Flexible, such as start-up, <b>shutdown,</b> operation mode <b>switching</b> process, low frequency oscillation phenomena and faults.

The digital {{real-time simulation}} is the necessary means to research and test the HVDC Flexible system. It can also be combined with the dynamic simulation tests to constitute the simulation test platform with more thorough functions and reduce the development cost and time of dynamic test system [21, 22].|$|R
40|$|Internet-scale {{distributed}} {{systems such as}} content delivery networks (CDNs) operate {{hundreds of thousands of}} servers deployed in thousands of data center locations around the globe. Since the energy costs of operating such a large IT infrastructure are a significant fraction of the total operating costs, we argue for redesigning them to incorporate energy optimization as a first-order principle. We focus on CDNs and demonstrate techniques to save energy while meeting client-perceived service level agreements (SLAs) and minimizing impact on hardware reliability. Servers deployed at individual data centers can be switched off at low load to save energy. We show {{that it is possible to}} save energy while providing client-perceived availability and limited impact on hardware reliability. We propose an optimal offline algorithm and an online algorithm to extract energy savings and evaluate them on real production workload traces. Our results show that it is possible to reduce the energy consumption of a CDN by 51 % while ensuring a high level of availability and incurring an average of one on-off transition per server per day. We propose a novel technique called cluster <b>shutdown</b> that <b>switches</b> off an entire cluster of servers, thus saving on both server and cooling power. We present an algorithm for cluster shutdown that is based on realistic power models for servers and cooling equipment and can be implemented as a part of the global load balancer of a CDN. We argue that cluster shutdown has intrinsic architectural advantages over server shutdown techniques in the CDN context, and show that it outperforms server shutdown in a wide range of operating regimes. To reduce energy costs, we propose a demand-response technique that responds to pricing signals from a smart grid by deferring elastic load. We propose an optimal offline algorithm for demand response and evaluate it on production workloads from a commercial CDN using realistic electricity pricing models. We show that energy cost savings can be achieved with no increase in the bandwidth cost...|$|R
5000|$|In {{reviewing}} Ubuntu 12.10 {{at the end}} of October 2012 for DistroWatch, Jesse Smith {{raised concerns}} about the Amazon shopping lens, saying, [...] "it has raised a number of privacy concerns in the community and, looking over Ubuntu's legal notice about privacy does not provide any reassurance. The notice informs us Canonical reserves the right to share our keystrokes, search terms and IP address with a number of third parties, including Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and the BBC. This feature is enabled by default, but can be turned off through the distribution's settings panel." [...] He also found that the dash provided very slow performance and that the release was [...] "practically unusable in the VirtualBox environment". He summed up his experiences, [...] "After {{a day and a half}} of using Ubuntu 12.10 it was an internal struggle not to wipe my hard drive and just find another distribution to review. During the first twenty-four hours Ubuntu spied on me, provided performance which was distinctly sub par, the interface regularly popped up errors (sometimes so frequently the first pop-up wouldn't have faded out of view before the next one appeared), the update notification didn't work and it wasn't possible to turn off accessibility features through the graphical interface. Adding insult to injury, the Unity dash kept locking up or losing focus while I was trying to use it and the operating system crashed more times than not while trying to <b>shutdown</b> or logout. <b>Switching</b> away from Unity to GNOME Fallback helped the performance issues I had experienced with the Dash, but it didn't remove the annoying pop-up errors and performance (while usable) still wasn't as good as I would expect. And what really makes me scratch my head is Ubuntu 12.04 worked really well on this same hardware." ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Design {{of modern}} {{powerful}} transistor generators with external exitation in meter and decameter wave ranges requires maximum utilisation of the transistor power capabilities. Transistors have no margins on the maximum permissible parameters and even minor derivations from normal mode can cause it fail. Known protection devices for band power amplifiers have a time constant greater than 20 - 30 us permissible overhead of transistor {{and can not}} protect the amplifier from short-circuit load or its failure. Helicon isolator at the output of transmitters for meter and decameter waves protects the transistor from the load mismatch and also decreases the intermodulation distortions level. The goal of this work is to study the on-turn transient of helicon isolator during the antenna break or short-circuit. Formulation of the problem. The maximum power dissipation in the helicon isolator depends on the maximum allowable temperature of the semiconductor resonator plate. In this work the transient processes in the helicon isolator after the sudden load mismatch are studied {{in order to reduce}} its sizes and weight for the given power level. Simulation. Temperature changes of the main part of helicon isolator ? helicon resonator with sizes 10 x 10 x 10 mm- 3 of indium antimonide dopped with tellurium with concentration 2. 1 1023 m- 3 are simulated in the approximation of one-dimensional model. The termal time constant was calculated. The resonator temperature variations are calculated with the different backward power levels. It is shown, that the time to reach the critical temperature 60 ?? for the isolator with 10 W dissipation power level is more than 0. 1 s and much more then required timeout for even simple emergency shutdown system of the band power amplifier for transmitters. Experimental results. Experimental study of the helicon isolator transient shows that the reverse attenuation decreases from - 23 dB to - 20 db in 0. 6 s and to - 15 dB in 1. 1 s. This timeout is enough to protect the transistor amplifier of the transmitter in emergency mode up to the power supply shutdown. Conclusion. Helicon isolators are efficient protection of transistor transmitters from load mismatch in meter and decameter wave ranges. The reflected power is adsorbed in the isolator at antenna break or short-circuits. The thermal time constant of the isolator is enough for even the very simple emergency power <b>shutdown</b> system to <b>switch.</b> ? ?????? ????????? ????????????? ? ????????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????????? ???????????? ??????? ??? ????????? ???????? ????????????????. ????????, ??? ??? ?????? ??? ???????? ????????? ????????
