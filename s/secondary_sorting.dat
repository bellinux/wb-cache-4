However, due to large Jewish populations in south-eastern Poland including Kraków, Lwów, Zamość and Warsaw which were not yet [...] "processed", Majdanek was refurbished as a killing center around March 1942. The gassing was performed in plain view of other inmates, without as much as a fence around the buildings. Another popular killing method was execution by the squads of Trawnikis. According to the Majdanek museum, the gas chambers began operation in September 1942. There are two identical buildings at Majdanek, where Zyklon-B was used. Executions were carried out in barrack 41 with the use of crystalline hydrogen cyanide released by the Zyklon B. The same poison gas pellets were used to disinfect prisoner clothing in barrack 42.|$|E

40|$|The rapid uptake of transcriptomic {{approaches}} in freshwater ecology {{has seen a}} wealth of data produced concerning {{the ways in which}} organisms interact with their environment on a molecular level. Typically, such studies focus either at the community level and so don’t require species identifications, or on laboratory strains of known species identity or natural populations of large, easily identifiable taxa. For chironomids, impediments still exist for applying these technologies to natural populations because they are small-bodied and often require time-consuming <b>secondary</b> <b>sorting</b> of stream material and morphological voucher preparation to confirm species diagnosis. These procedures limit the ability to maintain RNA quantity and quality in such organisms because RNA degrades rapidly and gene expression can be altered rapidly in organisms; thereby limiting the inclusion of such taxa in transcriptomic studies. Here, we demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome and outline an optimised protocol for collecting, sorting and preserving chironomid larvae that enables retention of both morphological vouchers and RNA for subsequent transcriptomics purposes. By ensuring that sorting and voucher preparation are completed within < 4 hours after collection and that samples are kept cold at all times, we successfully retained both RNA and morphological vouchers from all specimens. Although not prescriptive in specific methodology, we anticipate that this paper will assist in promoting transcriptomic investigations of the sublethal impact on chironomid gene expression of changes to aquatic environments. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Given a large graph G = (V, E) with {{millions}} of nodes and edges, how do we compute its connected components efficiently? Recent work addresses this problem in map-reduce, where a fundamental trade-off exists {{between the number of}} mapreduce rounds and the communication of each round. Denoting d the diameter of the graph, and n the number of nodes in the largest component, all prior techniques for map-reduce either require a linear, Θ(d), number of rounds, or a quadratic, Θ(n|V | + |E|), communication per round. We propose here two efficient map-reduce algorithms: (i) Hash-Greater-to-Min, which is a randomized algorithm based on PRAM techniques, requiring O(log n) rounds and O(|V | + |E|) communication per round, and (ii) Hash-to-Min, which is a novel algorithm, provably finishing in O(log n) iterations for path graphs. The proof technique used for Hash-to-Min is novel, but not tight, and it is actually faster than Hash-Greater-to-Min in practice. We conjecture that it requires 2 log d rounds and 3 (|V | + |E|) communication per round, as demonstrated in our experiments. Using <b>secondary</b> <b>sorting,</b> a standard mapreduce feature, we scale Hash-to-Min to graphs with very large connected components. Our techniques for connected components can be applied to clustering as well. We propose a novel algorithm for agglomerative single linkage clustering in map-reduce. This is the first mapreduce algorithm for clustering in at most O(log n) rounds, where n is the size of the largest cluster. We show the effectiveness of all our algorithms through detailed experiments on large synthetic as well as real-world datasets. I...|$|E

40|$|Aim: This {{research}} {{seeks to}} determine the accuracy of undergraduate paramedic students in applying the principles of initial and secondary triage for a given patient population in a simulated mass casualty incident following a module of mass casualty triage training. Methods: This project was a prospective observational study examining initial triage, <b>secondary</b> <b>sort</b> categories and ongoing triage categories allocated throughout a timed care cycle during a simulated mass casualty event. Patient triage categories were documented against a pre-planned patient population for initial triage, secondary triage and every 20 minutes from arrival on scene to the 120 -minute mark indicating {{the end of the}} simulation. The results were compared to determine accuracy with triage algorithms. At three months post learning, the students were re-evaluated with a sample of patient presentations, via an online test, assessing knowledge retained since completing the unit module. Results: The students were successful at applying the initial triage sieve based on physiological presentation and clinical findings in 76 % (SEM= 0. 035; 95 %CI= 7. 2) of cases and 58 % (SEM= 0. 062; 95 %CI= 12. 9) of cases during <b>secondary</b> triage <b>sorting</b> throughout the simulated exercise. This decrease was not significant (p= 0. 0808). The overall exercise accuracy rate was 68 % (SEM= 0. 033; 95 %CI= 6. 6). Three months later, the accuracy between initial triage (73 %; SEM= 0. 018; 95 %CI= 3. 5) and secondary triage principles (64 %; SEM= 0. 023; 95 %CI= 4. 6) show a significant deterioration in application (p= 0. 033). When relating the final accuracy rate of the exercise and the post-test combined, triage accuracy application following a modularised training session in triage principles and practice showed an insignificant decline (68 %; SEM= 0. 015; 95 %CI= 2. 8; p= 1. 0). However, the decline in accuracy between the application of the initial triage sieve categorisation (74 %; SEM= 0. 016; 95 %CI= 3. 1) and the <b>secondary</b> <b>sort</b> algorithm (59 %; SEM= 0. 022; 95 %CI= 4. 4) was significant (p= 0. 0008). Conclusions: Modular mass casualty triage accuracy for this cohort of graduating paramedic students was 68 %, for a given simulated mass shooting exercise with pre-planned moulaged victims. The course delivery as a module within a compartmentalised course may not provide students with adequate instruction and integration, that is, to be more specific with physiological presentation for correct triage categorisation as determined by triage algorithms. Paramedic academics and professional development providers may need to reconsider mass casualty triage and disaster medicine course design and delivery. There appears to be a need for a greater concerted effort into designing programs of instruction with better knowledge and practical skill integration (multiple exercises throughout the course, or over periods of time), to embed practice and reduce error rates in triage practice...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Very {{little is}} known about the {{environmental}} contamination, due to soiled clinical linens, of hospital laundry facilities. To study this environment, an exposure assessment was performed at an industrial clinical laundry facility in Seattle, WA, USA. Surface swab samples (n= 240) from the environment were collected from the facility over four time periods in 2015. These samples were cultured for three pathogens; Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Isolates were characterized by various methods including antibiotic resistance, presence of toxin producing genes, Multilocus sequence typing, 16 S sequencing and/or SCCmec typing. Voluntary participation among the employees consisted of nasal swabs for detection of MRSA, observations during their work and questionnaires. Odds of finding surface contamination with ≥ 1 pathogen were calculated. Contamination with all three pathogens was observed in the facility in both dirty and clean areas. The dirty area had a higher odds ratio than the clean area for overall contamination (≥ 1 pathogen) (OR= 18. 0). The odds ratios of individual pathogen presence varied for C. difficile (OR= 15. 5), MRSA (OR= 14. 8) and VRE (OR= 12. 6). The highest odds of finding surface contamination occurred in the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>sort</b> areas where dirty linens are manually sorted by employees (OR= 63. 0, p< 0. 001). MRSA nasal contamination was identified in 5 / 23 (22 %) employees, with four out of five working in the dirty area.

40|$|Dengue {{virus is}} {{responsible}} for ≈ 50 – 100 million infections, resulting in nearly 24, 000 deaths annually. The capsid (C) protein of dengue virus is essential for specific encapsidation of the RNA genome, but little structural information on the C protein is available. We report the solution structure of the 200 -residue homodimer of dengue 2 C protein. The structure provides, to our knowledge, the first 3 D picture of a flavivirus C protein and identifies a fold that includes a large dimerization surface contributed by two pairs of helices, one of which has characteristics of a coiled-coil. NMR structure determination involved a <b>secondary</b> structure <b>sorting</b> approach to facilitate assignment of the intersubunit nuclear Overhauser effect interactions. The dimer of dengue C protein has an unusually high net charge, and the structure reveals an asymmetric distribution of basic residues {{over the surface of}} the protein. Nearly half of the basic residues lie along one face of the dimer. In contrast, the conserved hydrophobic region forms an extensive apolar surface at a dimer interface {{on the opposite side of}} the molecule.

40|$|The Peoria loess of south-central Nebraska, {{deposited}} approximately {{during the}} last Glacial Maximum, can be subdivided into three zones: an upper laminated loess and a lower massive loess, separated by a dark gley zone in which bison bones and spruce charcoal are found. The lower Peoria unit is characterized by high organic matter content, relatively high bulk density, and common root channels. The upper Peoria unit has rhythmic patterns of two orders: strongly gleyed and weakly gleyed zones alternating in couplets about 2 - 5 m thick, and coarse- and fine-grained laminae of second order, about 2 - 4 mm thick. The strongly gleyed zones are relatively low in magnetic susceptibility and contain lenses with abundant fossil plant debris. They may have formed in active zones on top of permafrost during relatively cold and probably moist intervals, with magnetic susceptibility secondarily lowered in the redox environment. Magnetic susceptibility also indicates the possible existence of first-order rhythmic patterns in the lower massive loess. Each of the ten susceptibility oscillations within Peoria loess has a mean duration of about 1000 years, assuming that the loess was deposited between approximately 20, 000 - 22, 000 and 10, 000 - 10, 500 yr BP.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{evaluates the}} contribution of multi body system simulation to vehicle chassis development. The different topics we take into consideration are vehicle handling, control system design, primary ride, dynamic loads and <b>secondary</b> ride (<b>sorted</b> over frequency). As a simple process model we present the V-cycle, which is known from literature, especially from ECU software development. We distinguish two different phases: the specification phase (left side of the V = design synthesis) and the validation phase (right side of the V = design analysis). During synthesis (target cascading) we mainly work with virtual prototypes. Later during analysis (validation and troubleshooting) we also use hardware prototypes intensively. We consider three different criteria that are required to use simulation in the development process. These three aspects are physics/modeling (correspondence with measurements), the tool (ADAMS/Car-AT) and finally the correlation between subjective assessment and physical (objective) quantities. In the analysis phase it is generally easier for us to provide valuable results, because hardware already exists. We can measure a lot of parameters and also vehicle performance in order to correlate our models. A typical method for evaluating results is by calculating sensitivities and response surfaces. Here, it is sufficient to examine these results relative to a correlated baseline. Design synthesis {{is much more difficult}} because simulation results must be more accurate. Furthermore, since this is an early phase, there is more uncertainty in system parameter values. Some considerations will be discussed, regarding how we can use conceptual models that only partially exist to design our chassis. 1...|$|R

Himself he stood in his old constituency of Berga and was successful in 1891, but lost in 1893.

He is considered principal agent of carlismo nuevo in the region; Catalonia was the first stage of innovative Cerralbo's tours across the country and Llauder worked hand-in-hand with jefe delegado to implement new peaceful strategy and defuse conspiracy which aimed at renewing violence. He hugely contributed to smooth recovery of Catalan Carlism from the Nocedalista crisis; though Llauder had to cope with internal conflict; he played vital role in party consolidation of the 1890. His 1897 contribution to Acta de Loredan became last Llauder's major public engagement; starting 1898 due to rapidly deteriorating health he was spending long periods in the spa of Cardó and his regional leadership became largely theoretical. In 1898 the claimant declared him marqués de Vallteix. No scholar mentions Llauder discussing Carlist 1900 revolts in Catalonia, which suggests that shortly before death - still official jefe - he already played no major role in politics.|$|R

METHODS: Primary cultures of human corneal stromal cells were established from explants derived from cadaver eye donors. The cultures were sorted for CD 133 + and CD 34 + cells using magnetic beads. Both the primary cultures and <b>secondary</b> passages of <b>sorted</b> cells were further analysed by flow cytometry and western blot analysis for expression of the same antigens over time. RESULTS: Four different cell populations-namely, CD 133 +, CD 133 -, CD 34 + and CD 34 -, were identified in the culture samples. Two further specific subgroups were identified by flow cytometry: CD 133 +/CD 34 - cells and CD 133 +/CD 34 + cells. Expression of CD 133 declines more than CD 34 with time in cell cultures. Although most cells lost expression of these markers, small populations retained staining up to 5 weeks in culture.

Because Cairenes are generally not aware of the distinction between the wahiya and the Zabbaleen (also called zarraba), they continue to refer to both groups as Zabbaleen. It should be noted, however, that these two groups are distinct, serving different functions in the informal economy of collecting Cairo’s municipal solid waste (MSW). In response to government pressures to upgrade and modernize the refuse collection system, the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen made an agreement which resulted in the establishment of the Environmental Protection Company, as a private-for-profit company in 1989. Within the framework of the EPC, the wahiya contracted groups of Zabbaleen to collect and dispose of MSW. The Wahiya continued to collect the user fees from tenants, but also resumed the responsibility to cover hauling costs out of the fees they collected for the first time. The formation of the EPC was significant in that it established the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen as key participants in the collection of MSW, even though responsibility for MSW had been shared between the municipal sanitation service and the Zabbaleen since many prior decades.|$|R
40|$|This thesis used a ‘cognitive load plus’ {{approach}} to explore whether deliberate interventions, (e. g. secondary tasks and unanticipated interview questions) would (i) affect liars and truth tellers cognitive load differently {{during an interview}} and (ii) lead to differences in behaviour between liars and truth tellers {{which could be used}} to detect deception. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to the cognitive load {{approach to}} detecting deception and the growing body of research in this area. Next, Experiment 1 is reported in which a computer based target tracking secondary task was performed by (N = 45) lying and (N = 45) truth telling interviewees while they responded to an interviewer’s questions about a mission briefing they were given prior to being interviewed. Truth tellers described their true mission to the interviewer whereas liars gave a fictitious cover story. The main findings, supportive of the cognitive load approach, were that (i) liars made significantly less frequent eye-contact with the interviewer than truth tellers and (ii) liars’ behaviour was rated differently to truth tellers by an independent observer. However, against prediction, there were no differences between liars and truth tellers in terms of their computer task performance or in the numbers of details provided in their verbal statements. These findings informed the design of Experiment 2 A which examined the effect of asking unanticipated interview questions on lie detection. In an activity room truth tellers (N = 40) performed five simple tasks (e. g. pairing up playing cards). Liars (N = 40) observed the activity room through a window and were asked to generate a story in which they would claim to have performed five tasks. The interview schedule included four thematically related pairs of questions. The first question of each pairing was easy for interviewees to anticipate as it reflected how events are typically recalled (e. g. in normal chronological order). The second question included a perspective shift (temporal or spatial), which made the question harder for interviewees to anticipate (e. g. recalling the event in reverse order). Eye-gaze was also manipulated by asking half the interviewees to maintain constant eye-contact with the interviewer. Lastly, interviewees’ performed an object <b>sorting</b> <b>secondary</b> task while answering the interview questions. Compared to truth tellers, liars’ verbal responses showed a greater net decline in details, (termed Verbal decline), across three out of four question pairs. Liars also sorted significantly fewer objects per minute on the secondary task. However, there was no relationship between eye-gaze and veracity. In Experiment 2 B, 80 observers each saw a single edited video clip of either a liar or truth teller answering one pair of Expected/Unexpected questions from Experiment 2 A. Observers were instructed to make a veracity judgment while focussing only on {{the presence or absence of}} Verbal decline in the interviewee’s statement. Observers’ accuracy for detecting deception was compared with accuracy rates obtained from a discriminant analysis of the manually coded Verbal decline in Experiment 2 A. Observers identified liars with 65 % accuracy which compared favourably with the 67. 5 % accuracy of manual coding. However truth tellers were identified by observers with 60 % accuracy which was significantly below the 82. 5 % rate of manual coding. Experiment 3 retained the sorting task, eye-gaze manipulation and activity room scenario from Experiment 2 A while introducing three new pairings of Expected/Unexpected interview questions and two further unpaired questions requiring interviewees to (i) estimate the durations of two tasks they claimed to have completed and (ii) to suggest a future task completion strategy for one task they claimed to have performed in the activity room. Once again liars sorted significantly less correct objects per minute than truth tellers and there was a partial replication of the Experiment 2 A findings for Verbal decline. For the new questions: liars showed greater Verbal decline than truth tellers on one of the three new question pairings and liars were significantly less accurate than truth tellers at estimating duration. However, against prediction, liars’ suggested task strategies did not differ in complexity from truth tellers and again there was no relationship between eyegaze and veracity. Overall, the present thesis’ findings were largely supportive of the theory that lying can be more cognitively demanding than truth telling and that monitoring secondary task performance provides an objective measure of an interviewee’s cognitive load. Also it was demonstrated that strategic use of perspective shifted interview questions elicited a cue (Verbal decline) which could be used to detect deception. The practical and theoretical implications of the present experiments are discussed in a final chapter. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
