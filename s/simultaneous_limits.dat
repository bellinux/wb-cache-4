We explicitly show that, if these couplings arise from gauge invariant effective operators, the only relevant couplings for single top production and decay are the usual gamma^mu and sigma^mu nu q_nu terms, where q is the W boson momentum. This happens even in the single top production processes where the Wtb interaction involves off-shell top and/or bottom quarks. With this parameterisation for the Wtb vertex, we obtain expressions for the dependence on anomalous couplings of the single top cross sections, for (i) the t-channel process, performing a matching between tj and t bbar j production, where j is a light jet; (ii) s-channel t bbar production; (iii) associated tW- production, including the correction from tW- bbar.

The possibility of using a wicking irrigation system that relies on the suction plants create for water to mitigate the pumping pressure is investigated. A theoretical model for such a system is developed for an acre sized wicking irrigation system, and the power and water efficiency is compared to a standard drip irrigation system. While the wicking irrigation system has a greater distribution of water delivery from the wicks than compared to the dripper system, a wicking system has the potential to operate at much lower power, with the possibility of even being a power source. If a direct coupling could be developed between the plant's roots and wick, eliminating the need for water to travel through the soil, the energy benefit of the wicking system would be even more dramatic. by Lauren B.

The Wt single-top production mode helps to isolate the anomalous ttg and Wtb couplings, in contrast to top-pair production and other single-top production modes, where other new-physics effects can also contribute. We calculate the top polarization and the effects of these anomalous couplings on it at two centre-of-mass (cm) energies, 8 TeV and 14 TeV. As a measure of top polarization, we look at decay-lepton angular distributions in the laboratory frame, without requiring reconstruction of the rest frame of the top, and study the effect of the anomalous couplings on these distributions.

40|$|Top-antitop pairs {{produced}} at hadron colliders are largely unpolarized, but their spins are highly correlated. The structure of these correlations varies significantly over top production phase space, allowing very detailed {{tests of the}} Standard Model. Here, we explore top quark spin correlation measurement from a general perspective, highlighting the role of azimuthal decay angles. By taking differences and sums of these angles about the top-antitop production axis, the presence of spin correlations {{can be seen as}} sinusoidal modulations resulting from the interference of different helicity channels. At the LHC, these modulations exhibit nontrivial evolution from near-threshold production into the boosted regime, where they become sensitive to almost the entire QCD correlation effect for centrally produced tops. We demonstrate that this form of spin correlation measurement is very robust under full kinematic reconstruction, and should already be observable with high significance using the current LHC data set. We also illustrate some novel ways that new physics can alter the azimuthal distributions.

We present several new tests for systematic errors in the polarization data and conclude that W-band polarization data is not yet suitable for cosmological studies, but we suggest directions for further study. We do find that Ka-band data is suitable for use; in conjunction with the additional years of data, the addition of Ka band to the previously used Q- and V-band channels significantly reduces the uncertainty in the optical depth parameter, tau. Further scientific results from the five-year data analysis are presented in six companion papers and are summarized in Section 7 of this paper.
