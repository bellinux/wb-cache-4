5|$|We {{all feel}} as {{sensitive}} to satisfaction at times. We can look outside us and <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> destruction, avarice, and boredom. So {{we look to}} find that love where we can find it. Some people look to Hollywood, some people look to Blackpool and {{the bright lights of}} Blackpool. That's probably where I would look.|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Elsa befriends series protagonist Emma Swan, Emma and the series' central cast resolving the help Elsa find Anna. The group {{eventually}} discovers that a figure named the Snow Queen (a more faithful {{adaptation of the}} original fairy tale's character) is somehow responsible for Elsa's trapping in her urn, a woman with similar powers to Elsa. They soon discover that the Snow Queen is Elsa's aunt, Ingrid, who was forgotten from Arendelle when Elsa's mother, Gerda, used {{the power of the}} troll king to erase everyones memory of her, not wishing for the world to remember how Ingrid accidentally killed their third sister, Helga. Ingrid soon discovered a prophecy that stated she would one day have the love of her sisters again. With Ingrid's sisters dead however, she believed she would be forced to create new sisters. For this, she chose Emma and Elsa. Ingrid had stalked Emma her entire life in preparation for the prophecy to become true, and manipulated events in Arendelle to bring Elsa to her. Being convinced that she could only gain their love when {{she was the only one}} left, she obtained a mirror capable of bringing out the worst in people (the mirror coming directly from The Snow Queen fairy tale). If a piece of the mirror were to get in someones eye, they would <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on everyone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of its citizens to kill each other while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune. Ingrid had also used this to her advantage on Anna, forcing Anna to trap Elsa in the urn they originally found Elsa in.|$|E
25|$|All of pagandom (Indians) {{is fond of}} {{the pueblo}} of Los Angeles, of the rancho of Reyes, and of the ditches (water system). Here we <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> pagans, clad in shoes, with sombreros and blankets, and serving as muleteers to the {{settlers}} and rancheros, so {{that if it were}} not for the gentiles there would be neither pueblos nor ranches. These pagan Indians care neither for the missions nor for the missionaries.|$|E

Yea, but the {{counterfeit}} {{was good enough for}} my Lord who <b>sees</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> what is before his nose, and for my mother who <b>sees</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> what she will see. Well, he had fallen in with those who deem this same Mary our only lawful Queen, and would fain set her on the throne to bring back fire and faggot by the Spanish sword among us." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Selfs writing is, {{in other}} words, a handy {{illustration}} of the close link between cynic and sentimentalist. The person who looks at the world and <b>sees</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> pustulation is no better or worse—philosophically speaking—than the person who looks at the world and <b>sees</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> puppy dogs. As guides to the world they are equally reliable, {{which is to say}} not reliable at all. Self is writing literature, of course, not philosophy, and anyone using his work as a map deserves our every sympathy." ...|$|R

500|$|Varaha {{states that}} what one aspires to {{is part of}} His own [...] "light", which is all-encompassing. As Atman, self effulgent, Varaha states that [...] "Brahma-Jnanis" [...] are those who <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> the Brahman, and they are happy and content in the {{universe}} despite being subject to sufferings.|$|E
500|$|In late 1885 Watts's adopted {{daughter}} Blanche Clogstoun {{had just}} lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that [...] "I <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them." [...] Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in {{a society in which}} economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.|$|E
2500|$|I compare {{human life}} to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, {{the doors of the}} rest being as yet shut upon me—The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think—We remain there a long while, and {{notwithstanding}} the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle—within us—we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the heart and nature of Man—of convincing ones nerves that the World is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness, and oppression—whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd {{and at the same time}} on all sides of it many doors are set open—but all dark—all leading to dark passages—We see not the balance of good and evil. [...] We are in a Mist—We are now in that state—We feel the 'burden of the Mystery,' To this point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive when he wrote 'Tintern Abbey' and it seems to me that his Genius is explorative of those dark Passages. [...] Now if we live, and go on thinking, we too shall explore them. [...] he is a Genius and superior to us, in so far as he can, more than we, make discoveries, and shed a light in them—Here I must think Wordsworth is deeper than Milton ...|$|E
60|$|Not she. She had <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> {{her father}} until now. She saw Mr Jonas now, though; and blushed, and hung her head down, as {{she gave him}} welcome.|$|R
6000|$|She laughed exultingly. [...] "Ha, sir! {{see what}} comes of leaving me to better cavaliers, while you run after your fire! I should have <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> for Master Oakshott." ...|$|R

60|$|DMITRI. You will <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> {{suffering}} in it. They have tortured me.|$|E
60|$|At first Jerry could <b>see</b> <b>nothing,</b> <b>but</b> soon he {{discovered}} two {{forms in the}} semi-darkness.|$|E

60|$|MARGARET. Of course! [She {{lights a}} {{cigarette}} and hands the case to MABEL, who, however, <b>sees</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> her own thoughts] De Levis {{might just as well}} have pitched on me, except that I can't jump more than six inches in these skirts.|$|R
5000|$|... “Whatever my eyes glanced upon {{from that}} moment, I saw between lines which {{determined}} its outline. Now I perceived the outline invariably {{as distinct from}} the object, as a measurable form, the slightest deviation from which I could easily ascertain. Before I had <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> objects; now I saw <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> lines…” ...|$|R
5000|$|Any vehicle {{on a path}} {{of travel}} is at a state of {{indeterminacy}} until an object enters a location {{in the path of}} travel. (Wolf looks both ways down the road, <b>sees</b> <b>nothing,</b> <b>but</b> gets run over by a bus as soon as he tries to cross.) ...|$|R
60|$|But even {{so he got}} on no better, for {{he could}} <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> fire and smoke.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the vision}} faded away, {{and they could}} <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> the grass and trees and bushes around them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> {{shame and}} ruin!" [...] Olive shrieked, rushing across {{to her old}} friend, while Ransom discreetly quitted the scene.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have come}} at an opportune moment, sir, to see fighting. If you had come sooner you would have <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> running away. If {{you would like to}} make a tour of the walls to see what is going on, an officer shall {{accompany}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll have funked it, when {{he comes}} to the edge, and <b>sees</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> mist below.

6000|$|... "Isn't that beautiful?" [...] said Leslie, {{after a brief}} silence, {{pointing}} to the exquisite effect of a shaft of light falling through a cleft in the rock behind them, across a dark green pool at its base.

60|$|We stared {{with all}} our eyes, and there, yes, there, far ahead of us, was a faint, glimmering spot, {{no larger than a}} cottage window pane. It was so faint that I doubt if any eyes, except those which, like ours, had for days <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> blackness, could have {{perceived}} it at all.|$|R
50|$|The {{physiologist}} is {{no ordinary}} man. He is a learned man, a man possessed and absorbed by a scientific idea. He does not hear the animals' cries of pain. He is blind to the blood that flows. He <b>sees</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> his idea, and organisms which conceal from him the secrets he is resolved to discover.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{not with}} Lenore. Her sister spoke to me, {{and said it}} was not right when she had <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> Rockpier; but she as good as promised to stand my friend.

60|$|At breakfast I {{was able}} to take the news of his {{departure}} without making any sign. I fancy that Lady St. Maurice was watching me when she made the announcement.

6000|$|... "You may be deceived," [...] said Albert; [...] "the age {{has many}} {{such as this}} fellow, whose views of the spiritual and {{temporal}} world are so different, that they resemble {{the eyes of a}} squinting man; one of which, oblique and distorted, <b>sees</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> the end of his nose, while the other, instead of partaking the same defect, views strongly, sharply, and acutely, whatever is subjected to its scrutiny." ...|$|R
60|$|Magdalen {{looked at}} him through the {{gathering}} darkness in mute perplexity. All her little experience of society had been experience among people who possessed a common sense of honor, and a common responsibility of social position. She had hitherto <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> the successful human product from the great manufactory of Civilization. Here was one of the failures, and, with all her quickness, she was puzzled how to deal with it.|$|R
