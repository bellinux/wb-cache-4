40|$|Do {{you believe}} that bank {{shareholder}} equity provides an indefinitely lasting source of funding which covers for (residual) risk and loss-absorption? Our innovative approach clarifies and disentangles actual shareholder contribution to bank equity. This case study applies it to Deutsche Bank, a European <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>institution,</b> from 2001 to 2015. Our analysis shows that bank shareholder equity lasted for {{less than three months}} in 2007 in the bank entity, while payout policies exhausted shareholder contribution to loss-absorbing capital in 2006 - 2008. Since 2005, shareholder contribution to Tier 1 Capital remained below 10 %. According to our findings, the actual contribution by shareholders to bank equity capital was limited, while shareholder payout policies, including share buybacks and trading on its own shares, were material. These findings raise concerns on the actual capacity by shareholder equity to assure protection against (residual) risk and loss absorption. Customer and investor protections appear to lay with bank entity equity dynamics. These findings have implications for bank financial sustainability and resilience, company capital maintenance, and regulatory capital requirements. Further developments based upon this innovative methodology may improve on existing prudential and accounting regulations...|$|E

In this article, we consider the various alternatives for resolving <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>institutions.</b> Among these alternatives, we discuss OLA, a European-style bail-in process, and coerced mergers, while also extensively focusing on the bankruptcy code.

40|$|The Great Recession of 2008 caused banking {{failures}} {{around the}} globe. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision responded swiftly {{to create new}} minimum capital requirements for financial institutions in hopes of preventing additional failures and warding off future crises. Although the new capital standards that Basel III proposes are {{a step in the}} right direction, those standards alone will not be sufficient to prevent future bank failures in times of economic decline. Rather, true financial sector stability requires adequate capitalization of all institutions in terms of quality and quantity of capital, a strong regulatory framework, and a limitation on the size of <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>institutions.</b> By analyzing the pre-Recession banking regulation of the varying economies Canada, Switzerland, and the European Union, and each economy 2 ̆ 7 s resultant stability during the Great Recession, it becomes clear that minimum capital requirements for financial institutions do not directly correlate to financial sector longevity. This note considers the other factors that have an effect on the stability of financial sectors and proposes that Basel III capital minimum standards without strong banking regulations and reduction in the size of <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>institutions</b> will not prevent future financial turmoil...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of nationalization {{is that it}} eliminates the moral hazard inherent in private ownership of <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> financial <b>institutions.</b> [...] <b>Systemically</b> <b>important</b> financial <b>institutions</b> are likely to receive government bailouts {{in the event of}} failure. [...] Unless these bailouts are structured as a government takeover, and losses are imposed on bondholders and shareholders, investors have incentives to take extreme risks, to capture the upside during boom times, and to impose losses on taxpayers in times of crisis. [...] Permanent nationalization eliminates this dynamic by concentrating the full upside and downside with taxpayers. Permanent nationalization therefore may lead to lower and more rational risk levels in the financial system.|$|R

40|$|We examine {{government}} {{decisions to}} support troubled banks.

How a federation is designed has a strong influence on which banks are given public assistance. Where the top level of government is solely responsible for banks, there will be fewer <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>institutions</b> and so more banks {{will be allowed to}} fail. Where lower levels are responsible, governments will allow fewer failures. We use this approach to understand government support for failing banks in Germany.
