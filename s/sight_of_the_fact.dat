25|$|Teutberga was {{not capable}} of bearing {{children}} and Lothair's reign was chiefly occupied by his efforts to obtain an annulment of their marriage, and his relations with his uncles Charles the Bald and Louis the German were influenced by his desire to obtain their support for this endeavour.

2500|$|One {{reason that}} {{psychedelic}} therapy was eventually restricted was {{concern about the}} use of drugs by the general public. In the mid-1960s, in response to concerns regarding the proliferation of the unauthorized use of psychedelic drugs by the general public (especially the counterculture), various steps were taken to curtail their use. Bowing to governmental concerns, Sandoz halted production of LSD in 1965, and in many countries LSD was banned, or made available on a very limited basis that made research difficult. Gradually, increasing restrictions were placed on medical and psychiatric research conducted with LSD and other psychedelic substances. In a congressional hearing in 1966, Senator Robert Kennedy questioned the shift of opinion with regards to this potentially rewarding form of treatment, noting that, [...] "Perhaps to some extent we have lost <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that (LSD) can be very, very helpful in our society if used properly." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve safety, <b>the</b> {{organization}} <b>of</b> care is evolving from safety models centered on the individual, towards “systemic” models such as the “Swiss cheese” model developed by James Reason.

I will examine how these can be applied to reduce unjustified variability by for example developing clinical pathways. Strategies implemented to improve all aspects of health care quality are also evolving from an individual approach (centered on a practitioner or a hospital) to a more systemic one. The new challenges today are to decompartmentalize, to share expertise among the different actors (physicians, hospitals, insurance companies), to pool information vital for coordinating professionals and evaluating processes and to develop new regulation models between health care providers. The ultimate goal is not to provide more care, but care of higher value. That is why we can speak of a revolution and not merely an evolution...|$|R

40|$|Using collisionless N-body simulations, we {{investigate}} <b>the</b> tidal evolution <b>of</b> late-type, rotationally supported dwarfs inside Milky Way sized host galaxies.

Thus, the late-type progenitors are transformed into early-type dwarfs as envisioned by the tidal stirring model for <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies in the Local Group.

40|$|The {{so-called}} syphilitic antibodies can {{be removed}} from a serum by means of absorption with barium sulphate. The removal is due either to an adsorption or a mechanical absorption. <b>The</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syphilitic antibodies is thereby unimpaired. The readiness with which the absorption is accomplished with barium sulphate varies considerably with different syphilitic sera. That barium sulphate exerts the same absorbing effect upon non-syphilitic serum components is made evident by the interfering property which the latter manifest in <b>the</b> absorption experiment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syphilitic antibodies. <b>The</b> selective removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serum components, other than the syphilitic antibodies, by means of barium sulphate absorption is, therefore, impossible. On the other hand, a partial removal of these components, with but little removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syphilitic antibodies, may be effected when <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> a given serum is poor in syphilitic antibodies and comparatively rich in the indifferent serum components. But this is impossible if the conditions are reversed. The main reasons why some negative syphilitic sera may be so modified by the barium sulphate treatment as to give positive reactions, are explained below, but these apply only to those methods in which inactivated serum is employed. The inactivation reduces the antibody content to about one-fourth to one-fifth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original. When the serum is very rich in antibodies, this does not affect <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fixation test. But when <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antibodies is small, <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> inactivation creates conditions quite unexpected. It may produce such a condition that a given amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serum contains, after inactivation, {{only one or two}} antibody units, while the other serum components remain undiminished. Here one must not lose <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vital <b>fact</b> that these apparently indifferent serum constituents are not at all indifferent in the fixation processes. They may possess affinities which are similar to those <b>of</b> complement for <b>the</b> fixing combination <b>of</b> syphilitic serum and antigen. Speaking quantitatively, one unit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syphilitic antibodies plus antigen will fix 0. 1 cubic centimeter of guinea pig complement, but this unit can also be saturated and blocked by nearly <b>the</b> same amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seemingly indifferent serum component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serum to be tested. Moreover, <b>the</b> regular amount <b>of</b> inactivated serum used in the Wassermann system is 0. 2 cubic centimeter, a quantity sufficient to saturate two units <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fixing combination. Fortunately, this self-saturation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syphilitic antibody-antigen combination by the other serum components is not constant in occurrence, owing to <b>the</b> wide variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fixability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serum components <b>of</b> man. Here <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> Wechselmann's procedure becomes obvious. By removing a surplus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fixable indifferent serum components by means <b>of</b> barium sulphate, <b>the</b> serum is made to react positively, or more strongly than before the treatment with barium sulphate. This masking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> positive reaction through the self-saturation is liable to occur in any system in which inactivated serum is recommended. Another equally important factor in masking the positive reaction in a serum in which the antibodies are poor, is the presence in considerable amount of natural antisheep amboceptor in human serum. It is a plain and simple fact that an excess of hemolytic amboceptor renders a positive reaction feeble or completely negative. As we have shown in our present investigation, a hemolytic amboceptor {{can be removed}} from the serum by means of absorption with barium sulphate. Thus it is easy to understand why Wechselmann found that barium sulphate absorption improves the reaction in the original Wassermann system. <b>The</b> treatment <b>of</b> syphilitic serum with this salt can have a twofold benefit in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original method <b>of</b> Wassermann; namely, <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> certain interfering serum components and the removal or diminishing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural antisheep amboceptor present in the syphilitic serum. In <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> Noguchi, there is no necessity for applying the barium sulphate absorption. Noguchi recommends <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> unheated serum, hence <b>the</b> absolute amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serum employed is only one-half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> absolute amount <b>of</b> complement. Eventually an old serum may be anticomplementary and need inactivation, but if the result is doubtful in this instance, a fresh serum from the same patient may be secured and subjected to reëxamination. In this method there is no danger of introducing an amount of hemolytic amboceptor which is both unknown and uncontrollable, for the reason that human serum is usually devoid of isolysin (antihuman hemolytic amboceptor), and, if the latter is present, it never reaches the strength which shows any effect upon the hemolytic system employed. We conclude, therefore, that the barium sulphate absorption is to be recommended for <b>the</b> original method <b>of</b> Wassermann under certain conditions, but that it is unnecessary for the antihuman hemolytic system of Noguchi...|$|R

[...] "Speak so that the lowest may understand, and the rest will have no trouble." [...] And it had worked. At <b>the</b> halting {{lameness}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beginning an egg was thrown,--fortunately wide <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mark. After this incident Stephen fairly astonished his audience,--especially an elderly gentleman who sat on a cracker-box in <b>the</b> rear, out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stand.
