40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{synthesis}} of geopolymer from fly ash with sodium hydroxide as activator was studied. Fly ash {{was replaced by}} Lime <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> in various proportions (10 % and 15 %) where Fly ash was used as source material for {{synthesis of}} geopolymer. Sodium silicate (Na 2 SiO 3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solutions were mixed maintaining a silicate modulus (Na 2 O / SiO 2) at 1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury intrusion porosimetry was carried out to characterize the geopolymer specimens. Compressive strength and water absorption were also tested on geopolymer pastes. The results illustrate that high strength geopolymer pastes can be produced using mixture of fly ash with Lime <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> in lower curing temperature. The compressive strength of geopolymer paste specimens with 15 % Lime <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> were increased about 44 % when cured for 48 hours at 65 O C.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> looping process that relates to the removal of ventilation air methane using <b>stone</b> <b>dust.</b> The working principle behind the <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> looping process is incredibly simple which involves the catalytic oxidation of methane followed by carbonation and calcination reactions. In the current work, laboratory scale fluidized bed experiments and process simulations were conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> looping process. The experimental work concluded that oxidation of ventilation air methane in the <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> looping process can be successfully achieved at temperatures between 500 and 650 °C. The experimental results indicated that oxidation of methane was found to increase at higher temperatures while carbon dioxide capture efficiency showed a declining trend with increasing temperature. Furthermore, higher methane conversion and optimum (thermodynamic) carbon dioxide capture efficiency were observed for lower ventilation air methane flow rates and higher bed inventory. The concentration of methane in ventilation air methane and <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> particle size did not {{have a significant effect on}} methane conversion or carbon dioxide capture. Also, comparison with synthetically prepared CuO and Fe 2 O 3 catalysts has been made with CaO for VAM oxidation. CaO was found to be comparable to Fe 2 O 3 and superior to CuO. From the process simulations, it was concluded that thermal energy generation in the carbonator was increased with higher methane and carbon dioxide concentrations. However, at the same time for higher methane and carbon dioxide concentrations, a greater CaO flux was required in the carbonator and hence a larger amount of goaf gas was required for the calcination reaction. The higher thermal energy generation in the carbonator was expected to improve the autothermicity of the <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> looping process at concentrations of methane in the ventilation stream < 0. 2 vol. % (thermodynamic limit) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} defence against propagating {{coal dust}} explosions is {{the application of}} dry <b>stone</b> <b>dust.</b> This proven and effective safety measure is strictly regulated based on extensive international experience. While new products, such as foamed <b>stone</b> <b>dust,</b> offer significant practical benefits, no benchmark tests currently exist to certify their dust lifting performance in comparison to dry <b>stone</b> <b>dust.</b> This paper reviews the coal dust explosion mechanism, and argues that benchmark testing should focus on dust lifting during the initial development of the explosion, prior to arrival of the flame. In a practical context, this requires the generation of shock waves with Mach numbers ranging from 1. 05 to 1. 4, and test times {{of the order of}} 10 ’s to 100 ’s of milliseconds. These proposed test times are significantly longer than previous laboratory studies, however, for certification purposes, it is argued that the dust lifting behaviour should be examined over the full timescales of an actual explosion scenario. These conditions can be accurately targeted using a shock tube at length scales of approximately 50 m. It is further proposed that useful test time can be maximised if an appropriately sized orifice plate is fitted to the tube exit, an arrangement which also offers practical advantages for testing. The paper demonstrates this operating capability with proof-of-concept experiments using The University of Queensland’s X 3 impulse facility...|$|R
