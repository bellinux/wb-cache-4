50|$|Sir Clement {{apparently}} guided many {{of these}} developments; though he probably did not personally benefit from them financially, his sons probably did. Sir Clement is certainly to be credited with the practical application of the reverberatory furnace (or cupola) to several metallurgical processes. Until the introduction in the late 18th century of the foundry cupola (which {{is a sort of}} small blast furnace), his air furnace was the normal way of remelting pig for foundry purposes. The cupola (reverberatory furnace) long remained in use for <b>smelted</b> <b>copper</b> and lead, and was applied by Robert Lyddall to tin.|$|E

The copper tools were produced in the Chalcolithic villages {{on the banks of}} the Be’er Sheva valley where slag fragments, clay crucibles, some possible furnace lining pieces, copper prills, and amorphous lumps were found, in addition to high-grade carbonated copper ore (cuprite). The ore was collected and selected in the area of Feinan in Trans-Jordan and transported to northern Negev villages some 150 km to the north, to be smelted for the local production of these copper objects.|$|E

50|$|The {{route to}} later connect Cloncurry with Mount Isa was a {{creature}} of history. Any extension beyond Cloncurry was overwhelmingly to be dictated by mining interests. The first section went south, with the second section going south west and the final section going north west. Firstly came the Selwyn Branch Railway (Dajarra and Selwyn railway lines) that opened on 15 December 1910 and ran south from Cloncurry to the Hampden and Mt Elliott mines. <b>Smelted</b> <b>copper</b> was railed east and coking coal on return journeys. Cattle and coke also exchanged trips. Next in 1911 came construction work on the Dajarra Branch Railway south-west of the Selwyn Branch. It branched from the Selwyn branch at Malbon and opened to Duchess on 21 October 1912 and to Dajarra on 16 April 1917.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stream is}} named after the Coppermill. The mill was {{purchased}} by British Copper Company in 1808. The <b>smelted</b> <b>copper</b> {{was brought to the}} mill from Landore, Swansea, Wales via the Thames by barge. The copper ingots were used to produce penny and halfpenny tokens. [...] Production ceased in 1857. Before milling copper the mill {{can be traced back to}} the 14th century when corn was ground [...] In the 1670s the mill was used in the production of gunpowder. Later in 1690 for rolling paper [...] In 1712 as a leather mill and its next use in the manufacture of linseed oil. The mill was purchased by the East London Waterworks Company in the late 1850s and the mill was modified to drive a water pump to assist in the building of reservoirs on nearby marshland. Today the mill is owned by Thames Water.|$|E
50|$|The estuary {{cuts through}} the {{southern}} part of a once-important coalfield. Llanelli, on its north shore, was noted for its tinplate industry, whilst Penclawdd, on the south side, <b>smelted</b> <b>copper</b> from ore shipped in from Anglesey. Both required ready access to the Bristol Channel via Carmarthen Bay. The main channel has fluctuated from side to side of the estuary in the past; in the late 19th century, the Llanelli Port Authority obtained legislation permitting the construction of a training wall intended to confine it to {{the north side of the}} estuary; unfortunately, this merely dissipated the currents, accelerating the silting-up not only of the entrance to Llanelli North Dock but also of the Penclawdd anchorage. The wall has since been breached in several places.A later influence on the physical environment was the planting of cordgrass (Spartina anglica) to claim grazing land at the western end of the Gower side during the 1930s. This vigorous grass has since spread in a wide band all along the south side, forming the basis of a salt-marsh supporting the grazing of sheep, ponies and cattle.|$|E

5000|$|Construction of the Selwyn Branch {{began in}} 1909. The line ran about 50 {{kilometres}} south from Cloncurry railway station to Malbon railway station with sidings built en route at Dolomite, Marimo, Mitakoodi and Marraba. From there it continued {{south to the}} Hampden mine and opened on 11 June 1910. The fledgling township was first named Gulatten, then Hampden, then {{for a brief time}} Friezland before finally being renamed in 1916 as Kuridala (an Aboriginal word indicating eagle hawk). [...] An extension further south to the Mount Elliott mine at Selwyn opened on 15 December 1910 (along with the Selwyn Range named after Alfred Selwyn, Director of the Geological Survey of Victoria). [...] <b>Smelted</b> <b>copper</b> was railed east and coking coal on return journeys. Cattle and coke also exchanged trips. Falling copper prices forced the closure of the Mount Elliott and Hampden smelters in 1919 and 1920 respectively. The branch continued to operate at a slow pace until it was closed in 1961. Road transport no doubt squeezed out the cattle market.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSamples of copper-based {{artifacts}} from four components from three Late Iroquoian archaeological sites in southern Ontario were analysed using Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. Compositional {{analysis showed that}} the concentrations of Ni, Zn, As, Ag, Sn, Sb, Au, Bi, Co, In and Pb clearly differentiate North American native copper from European-introduced <b>smelted</b> <b>copper</b> and brass. Together with radiocarbon dates, this indicates the presence of trade metals on Iroquoian sites {{in the early to}} mid sixteenth century, well in advance of a European presence in the region. The small sample analysed suggests that red brass appears earlier than yellow brass, and trade metals may be found at sites in the Lake Ontario drainage before they are found in the southern Georgian Bay area...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{discusses}} {{the relevance of}} compositions obtained using laser ablation – inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (LA–ICP–MS) {{for the purpose of}} identifying the provenance of copper-based artefacts found in Virginia at Native American sites dated from the 16 th to the 18 th centuries. Ten artefacts were investigated by scanning electron microscopy – energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM–EDS) to visualize the corrosion and characterize the heterogeneities in the metal and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) to determine separately the compositions of the intact metal and of the corrosion product. It is shown that the corroded surfaces are highly depleted in zinc but that representative concentrations can be determined by sampling the deeper, uncorroded metal. In contrast, lead values are highly variable because of the heterogeneous distribution of this metal within the bulk copper. Despite these problems, brass is easily identifiable and American native copper and European <b>smelted</b> <b>copper</b> can be unambiguously distinguished with LA–ICP–MS on unprepared artefacts using As, Ag, Ni and Sb trace elements...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{attempts}} to discover {{meaning in the}} archaeological record have defined that meaning in social rather than cultural terms. This dissertation seeks cultural meaning by applying the concept of technological style to archaeological data from Cerro Huaringa (A. D. 1100 - 1535), the first pre-European smelting site to be discovered in the New World. First, the anthropological investigation of technology is reviewed and {{the current state of}} knowledge about Andean metallurgy is outlined. Next, the discovery and excavation of the Cerro Huaringa arsenical copper smelting industry are recounted. Then the techniques used in that industry are reconstructed, revealing a smelting process that relied on human lung power instead of mechanical bellows to provide draft to the furnaces. This reliance limited the temperatures attainable, thus preventing a thorough melting of the furnace contents and making impossible a complete separation of the <b>smelted</b> <b>copper</b> metal from its slag byproduct. Large grindstones called batanes were used to crush the slag, freeing small prills of copper to be gleaned by hand. This laborious process did not change significantly for at least 600 years. An explanation for this persistant commitment to lung-powered draft {{can be found in the}} role of breath in the Andean worldview. Ethnohistorical, ethnographic, and linguistic evidence suggest that breath was believed to play a vital, transformational role in the circulation of the supernatural life force which suffuses the Andean cosmos. Technological consequences of this cultural choice include the perpetuation of smelting as an unsophisticated task suitable for unskilled, low status laborers, the preclusion of the discovery of metallic iron, and the rapid, complete replacement of Andean smelting practices with those of the Spanish. ...|$|E
40|$|A major turning point, the {{introduction}} of metalworking into prehistoric society saw the development complex political economies. There is, however, a particular nescience {{with regard to the}} metallurgy of Southeast Asia and the impact that its introduction had in this region. This is particularly true of the Lao PDR, for which there are no known archaeometallurgical sites. Metallurgical investigation in Southeast Asia has largely focused on Thailand for which we now have a rich panoply of data. Consequentially much of what we know about bronze metallurgy, its operation, spread and development in Southeast Asia comes solely from Thailand. Discoveries of metallurgical sites outside Thailand are therefore of considerable significance. Contemporary copper and gold mining by Lang Xiang minerals in Savannakhet Province, Southern Laos, has unearthed what are thought to be two prehistoric archaeological sites Puen Baolo (PBL) and Dragon Field (DF). Their proximity to areas of known copper mineralisation are unlikely to be a coincidence and archaeological excavations conducted at each of these sites by Dr. Chang of James Cook University have uncovered material thought to be metallurgical in nature. The aim of this report, conducted under the aegis of Dr. Chang and Lang Xiang Minerals, is to determine whether we now have the first metallurgical material from a prehistoric site in Laos and if so, the nature that this material takes. Confirming this material as metallurgical, and identifying the nature of their operation, would allow Laos to take a central stage in regional archaeology as well as providing a much needed new perspective on Southeast Asian archaeometallurgy and the debates surrounding {{the introduction}} and impact of bronze. Using mainly optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), analysis has confirmed the material relates to a copper metallurgical industry with crucibles being the most abundant ‘technofact. ’ Other materials include, slag, ore/gangue, and a leaded-copper ingot from Dragon Field. Most importantly, these crucibles have been identified as being involved in the primary production of copper from its ores, by crucible smelting. This is usually restricted to easily <b>smelted</b> <b>copper</b> oxide ores, however, evidence suggests that the more difficult sulphide ores were also being smelted. Evidence from PBL suggests that its inhabitants were co-smelitng oxide and sulphide ores in a sophisticated, somewhat mechanical manner. Crucibles here were used as “reaction vessels” (cf. Bennett, 1989) whereby oxidic and sulphidic ores were combined and the oxygen and sulphur in each ore ‘reacted’ producing the gas SO 2, removing both from the system, leaving slag and most importantly, metallic copper. At DF, however, we can be less certain of operation without further information. It is possible that its inhabitants were reduction smelting oxidic ores (smelting in the absence of oxygen using charcoal as reducing agent) (suggesting DF maybe older than PBL) or smelting sulphidic ores that had been processed to remove all sulphur (dead-roasting) prior to reduction smelting (suggesting DF later than PBL). Further research will provide more answers here. This report represents a significant advancement in our knowledge of how prehistoric metallurgy was conducted in Southeast Asia. Given these findings, Laos can now take its place as a regional player in the spread and development of metallurgy throughout this colourful region. Although this report has provided much information, further investigation is required, especially from Dragon Field in order to fully understand the industry including the relationships between DF and PBL and between PBL, DF and their surrounding landscapes, as well as identifying the important relationship between people and technology. The key point is whether the inhabitants of these sites were also mining the copper from the hills around them or were they merely smelting pre-mined material? Therefore the following recommendations ensue; *Conduct a comprehensive archaeological survey of the surrounding areas of both Puen Baolo and Dragon Field. Especially for evidence of surface mineralisation, mining, beneficiation, slag deposits as well as for landscape modifications. *Further excavate Puen Baolo but especially Dragon Field to retrieve further material for analysis. *Conduct further analysis on retrieved material. *Investigate the DF ingot by sectioning it for analysis under scanning electron microscope. *Analyse portions of the possible ore/gangue retrieved from these sites. *Of importance is the need to date these sites, therefore the final recommendation is to identify material that will provide radiometric dates for occupation...|$|E
