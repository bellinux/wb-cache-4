25|$|Attainment {{of sexual}} {{maturity}} in Tarebia granifera is generally {{indicated by the}} size of the smallest snail observed to give birth rather than a histological assessment of the development of the gonad and associated reproductive structures. Appleton & Nadasan (2002) estimated onset of maturity at 10–12mm <b>shell</b> <b>height</b> but unpublished data suggest a height closer to 8mm in line with other published studies. Tucker Abbott (1952) estimated sexual maturity at between 5.5 and 8.0mm at different stations over a short stretch of river in Florida. Chaniotis et al. (1980) gave a similar estimate of 6.0-7.0mm from a cohort of laboratory-bred snails in Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|Dissection of Tarebia granifera showed blastula stage embryos in the brood pouches of snails {{as small}} as 8mm <b>shell</b> <b>height.</b> Small numbers of shelled embryos, {{including}} veligers, were found in snails of 10–14mm but became more plentiful in snails >14mm and especially those >20mm. Importantly, unshelled embryos (blastula, gastrula and trochophore stages) were not found in snails >16mm and the numbers of shelled embryos themselves decreased in the largest snails, >24mm. This suggests that differentiation of germinal cells in the ovary and their subsequent arrival in the brood pouch as blastulae is not a continuous process over a breeding season but occurs as one or more ‘cohorts’ or ‘pulses’ which stop before the birth rate of young snails reaches its maximum. So it seems that while the first birth may occur in snails {{as small as}} 8mm, these are few and most juveniles are born to snails >14mm. The size of the shell of the parent at peak release of juveniles is 24.0mm.|$|E
25|$|The <b>shell</b> <b>height</b> {{is up to}} 41.1mm, 1.65 {{times as}} long as wide, umbilicate and deeply perforated, conical, with {{slightly}} convex sides and solid. Ground colour is uniformly whitish-corneous, the upper whorls are lighter, with four spiral light chestnut-brown bands, a small one below the white-lined suture, two broader ones {{above and below the}} periphery (which in some specimens are faintly subdivided into two equally broad bands) and a fourth band encircling the umbilicus. The surface is lustreless, with growth striae and spiral lines of fine, punctuate granulation, starting shallowly on the postnepionic whorl, but becoming rapidly more conspicuous on the following and fading away inside the umbilicus. The protoconch is pit-reticulate. The shell has 6.3 whorls that are somewhat convex. The last whorl is saccate. The suture is impressed, somewhat crenulate, at the aperture ascending in front. The aperture is large, ovate, glossy white inside with the pattern visible in banded specimens. Apertural margins are converging. The aperture is 1.30 times as long as wide, 0.70 times the total height. The peristome is broadly expanded and backwardly reflexed, glossy whitish. Columellar margin is straight, broadly expanded and merging into the rather thick parietal callus.|$|E

500|$|Species in {{the genus}} Amphidromus usually have smooth, glossy, brightly colored, {{elongate}} or conic, dextrally or sinistrally coiled shells. The shells are moderately large, ranging from [...] to [...] in maximum dimension, having from 6 to 8 convex whorls. Their color pattern is usually monochromatic yellowish or greenish, {{but can be}} variegated. The aperture is oblique or ovate in shape, without any teeth or folds, and with the aperture height ranging from two-fifths to one-third of total <b>shell</b> <b>height.</b> The peristome is expanded and/or reflected, and is sometimes thickened. The columella may be straight or recurved, and the parietal callus is weak to well-developed, and the umbilicus may be open or closed. The radula is spatulate, has cusped teeth arranged in rows, usually with a monocuspid central tooth and bicuspid or tricuspid lateral teeth. The jaw is thin and weak, with low flat ribs. The pallial region is sigmurethrous, with a very long, narrow kidney. The genitalia are that of typical camaenids, with a long seminal receptacle, a short penis with low insertion of the retractor muscle, and a short or long epiphallic caecum (flagellum and appendix). The spermatophores have a pentagonal outline in cross-section. Amphidromus are typically arboreal animals.|$|E

2500|$|Once an egg is fertilized, {{it is then}} planktonic, {{which is}} a {{collection}} of microorganisms that drift abundantly in fresh or salt water. [...] Larvae stay in the water column for the next four to seven weeks before dissipating to the ocean floor, where they attach themselves to objects through byssus threads. Byssus is eventually lost with adulthood, transitioning almost all scallop species into free swimmers. There is rapid growth within the first several years, with an increase of 50 to 80% in <b>shell</b> <b>height</b> and quadrupled size in meat weight and reach commercial size at about four to five years of age. The lifespans of some scallops have been known to extend over 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|This {{species is}} closely allied to Scutalus ortizpuentei Weyrauch, 1967 which was {{described}} from Dept. Cajamarca, Río Chancay valley, between Chiclayo and Chota, 80km north of Quinden (ca. 06°38’S 079°05’W) in Peru. It differs from this species by being smaller (41 vs. 48mm <b>shell</b> <b>height),</b> having a smaller aperture, and the lip more broadly expanded. The faintly visible subdivision of the spiral bands around the periphery, visible in some specimens of Scutalus mariopenai, resembles the more pronounced colour pattern in Scutalus ortizpuentei.
