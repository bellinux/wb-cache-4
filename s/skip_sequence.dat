40|$|This paper studies {{questionnaire}} design as a formal decision problem, focusing on {{one element of}} the design process: <b>skip</b> <b>sequencing.</b> We propose that a survey planner use an explicit loss function to quantify the trade-off between cost and informativeness of the survey and aim to make a design choice that minimizes loss. We pose a choice between three options: ask all respondents about an item of interest, use <b>skip</b> <b>sequencing,</b> thereby asking the item only of respondents who give a certain answer to an opening question, or do not ask the item at all. The first option is most informative but also most costly. The use of <b>skip</b> <b>sequencing</b> reduces respondent burden {{and the cost of}} interviewing, but may spread data quality problems across survey items, thereby reducing informativeness. The last option has no cost but is completely uninformative about the item of interest.

40|$|Alternative {{splicing}} is {{a hallmark}} of glycoprotein hormone receptor gene regulation, but its molecular mechanism is unknown. The LH receptor (LHR) gene possesses 11 exons, but exon 10 is constitutively skipped in the New World monkey lineage (LHR type 2), whereas it is constitutively spliced in the human (LHR type 1). This study identifies the regulatory elements of exon 10 usage. Sequencing of genomic marmoset DNA revealed that the cryptic LHR exon 10 is highly homologous to exon 10 from other species and displays intact splice sites. Functional studies using a minigene approach excluded the contribution of intronic, marmoset-specific long interspersed nucleotide- 1 elements to exon 10 <b>skipping.</b> <b>Sequencing</b> of the genomic regions surrounding exon 10 from several primate lineages, sequence comparisons including the human and mouse LHR gene, revealed the presence of unique nucleotides at 3 '-intronic position – 19 and – 10 and at position + 26 within exon 10 of the marmoset LHR.

While is a simple imperative language consisting of <b>skip,</b> assign-ment, <b>sequence,</b> conditional and loop. We first develop trace-based interpreters for While. Traces are potentially infinite nonempty sequences of states. The interpreters assign traces to While programs: for us, traces are denotations of While programs. The trace is finite if the program is terminating and infinite if the program is non-terminating. However, we cannot decide (i. e., write a program to determine), for any given program, whether its trace is finite or infinite, which amounts to deciding the halting problem. We then extend While with interactive input/output primitives. Accordingly, we extend the interpreters by generalizing traces to resumptions. The tutorial is based on our previous work with T.

40|$|Non-viral gene {{delivery}} vectors with messenger RNA (mRNA) as a carrier of genetic information {{are among the}} staple gene transfer vectors for research in gene therapy, gene vaccination and cell fate reprogramming. As no passage of genetic cargo {{in and out of}} the nucleus is required, mRNA-based vectors typically offer the following five advantages: 1) fast start of transgene expression; 2) ability to express genes in non-dividing cells with an intact nuclear envelope; 3) insensitivity to the major gene silencing mechanisms, which operate in the nucleus; 4) absence of potentially mutagenic genomic insertions; 5) high cell survival rate after transfection procedures, which do not need to disturb nuclear envelope. In addition, mRNA-based vectors offer a simple combination of various transgenes through mixing of several mRNAs in a single multi-gene cocktail or expression of a number of proteins from a single mRNA molecule using internal ribosome entry sites (IRESes), ribosome <b>skipping</b> <b>sequences</b> and proteolytic signals. However, on the downside, uncontrolled extracellular and intracellular decay of mRNA can be a substantial hurdle for mRNA-mediated gene transfer. Procedures for mRNA delivery are analogous to DNA transfer methods, which are well-established. In general, there are three actors in the {{gene delivery}} play, namely, the vector, the cell and the transfer environment. The desired outcome, that is, the efficient delivery of a gene to a target cell population, depends on the efficient interaction of all three parties. Thus, the vector should be customised for the target cell population and presented in a form that is resistant to the aggressive factors in the delivery milieu. At the same time, the delivery environment should be adjusted to be more vector-friendly and more cell-friendly. The recipient cells should be subjected to a specific regimen or artificially modified to become receptive to gene transfer with a particular vector and resistant to the environment. As a rule, barriers outside tissues (e. g. mucus) and an aggressive intercellular environment complicate gene delivery in vivo, which, therefore, requires more complex gene transfer procedures than transfection of tissue culture cells. This review is focused on transfection methods for mRNA vectors, which rely either on the forceful propulsion of mRNA inside the target cells (e. g. by electroporation or gene gun) or on the complexing of mRNA with other substances (e. g. polycationic transfection reagents) for delivery via endocytic pathways...|$|R

Previous research has identified methods to distinguish alternative conserved exons (ACEs) in human and mouse.

Human RefSeq exons obtained from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser were analyzed for tissue-specific <b>skipping.</b> Expressed <b>sequence</b> tags (ESTs) were aligned to exons and their tissue of origin and histology were identified. ACEs were also identified as {{a subset of the}} skipped exons. About 18 % of the exons were identified as tissue-specifically skipped in one of sixteen different tissues at four stringency levels. The different datasets were analyzed for both general features such as exon and intron length, splice site strength, base composition, conservation, modularity, and susceptibility to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay caused by skipping. Cis-element motifs that might bind protein factors that affect splicing were identified using overrepresentation analysis and conserved occurrence rate between human and mouse. (cont.) Tissue-specific skipped exons were then classified with both a decision-tree based classifier (Random ForestsTM) and a support vector machine.
