This section was incompatible with Class C units and these were therefore retired. To meet the required number of trains, six T1000 units were converted to T1300. The Røa Line from Sørbyhaugen to Volvat closed on 18 May 1995, allowing the Røa Line upgraded to metro standard. At the same time, the Lillaker Line tram was extended from Jar to Kolsås. The upgrade involved the line receiving automatic train control with cab signaling, third-rail power supply and longer platforms. Until 20 August, Line 14 only operated between Kolsås and Montebello. After the Røa Line reopened, the third rail had been laid to Montebello, and the trains had to <b>switch</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> and signaling system there.|$|E

The weight is 17kg.The side boards and face plate are made of extruded aluminum and the top cover is 2 mm thick steel board covered by aluminum board.DVD playback part is based on DV-9, and thus its component video output for DVD supports progressive scan (while DVL-919 only support interlaced).Audio functions are also improved and support 24-bit 96kHz Legato Link S (while -919 is without ‘S’).All its RCA connectors are gold-plated (compare to version DVL-919 only use nickel-plated RCA connectors).The remote control for -H9 is the same used for version DVL-919, the model is DV027.The [...] "subtitle" [...] key in the remote works for LD as well, this is because the DVL-H9 has a built-in LD-G decoder.Laser pickups are identical to -919.
