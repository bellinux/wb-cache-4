40|$|Under a {{constant}} applied load, {{the operation of}} a typical elastohydrodynamic lubrication involves three stages, namely the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> stage, the normal steady state operation stage and the shut down stage. Previous works focused on the second normal steady state operation stage, in which a continuous lubricant film is separating the contacting surfaces. This dissertation numerically and analytically studies the lubrication behavior in the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> and shut down stages of elastohydrodynamic lubrication operations. ^ A mixed phase lubricated-solid contact model is developed to study the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> stage and demonstrates {{the transition from the}} initial solid to solid contact, to the mixed lubricated-solid contact, and finally to the fully lubricated contact. A surface temperature model is developed to calculate the surface temperature rise in the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> process of circular contact in sliding conditions. Because of the solid contact occurring during this process, significant frictional heat is generated and the surface temperature rise is very high. ^ The shut down process of elastohydrodynamic lubrication operation is studied and the numerical results are compared with the experimental results. Because of the characteristics of EHL flow, analytical expressions are derived to predict the pressure and film thickness changes during the shut down process and these predictions agree well with the numerical results. ^ Surface pocket effects in line contact <b>start</b> <b>up</b> condition are then examined in an effort to achieve beneficial tribological performance through surface modification. In the initial static contact situation, lubricant trapped inside the pocket generates hydrostatic pressure and reduces the pressure spikes and subsurface stresses, compared with the dry contact situation. When the surfaces start to move, this hydrostatic pressure enables a pocket lubricant film build up in addition to the inlet lubricant film build <b>up.</b> Essentially the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> process is divided into two parallel micro-EHL <b>start</b> <b>ups.</b> The <b>start</b> <b>up</b> time is reduced and the solid contact vanishes faster than the smooth surface <b>start</b> <b>up.</b> As a result, the frictional heat in the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> process would be much smaller and subsequently the surface temperature rise would be much reduced, compared with the smooth surface <b>start</b> <b>up</b> condition. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{automobile}} manufacturers aspire {{to improve the}} engine design and enhance its life apart from optimizing the energy usage in the actual engine operation. A major concern {{at the time of}} the initial <b>start</b> <b>up</b> at the low loads and speed conditions is the wear of an engine. A significant proportion of the engine life gets compromised due to the adhesive engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> wear. The <b>start</b> <b>up</b> wear does not exist during the normal engine operation due to the fully established elastohydrodynamic lubricating (EHL) film between the interacting surfaces of the piston assembly and the cylinder liner at the high loads, speeds and the optimum piston-to-bore radial clearances. Such arrangements do not exist in a few initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> cycles. Resultantly, the piston skirts and the 1 st compression ring establish a physical contact with the liner and adhesive wear occurs. This PhD research work numerically models the lubrication of the piston skirts and the 1 st compression ring in the initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up.</b> The 2 -D hydrodynamic and EHL models of the piston skirts are developed in the initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> conditions. The initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> conditions cover the secondary transverse piston displacements and the different <b>start</b> <b>up</b> speeds, radial clearances & viscosity-grades of an engine lubricant. The realistic aspects include the isothermal & adiabatic conditions, the steady-state and transient conditions, the Newtonian and non-Newtonian engine lubricant behavior, the surface roughness factors of the piston skirts and the liner. These aspects are modeled, studied and analyzed separately as part of the hydrodynamic and EHL models of the skirts. The 1 -D and the 2 -D steady-state isothermal Newtonian lubrication models of 1 st compression ring are developed as applicable to the initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> conditions. The simulation analysis are studied to optimize the different realistic aspects/characteristics in an effort to reduce the engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> wea...|$|R

5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site <b>started</b> <b>up</b> the B Reactor, {{the first of}} its three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster.

In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. When the plant was <b>started</b> <b>up</b> for testing on schedule in October 1943, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of the}} magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside.

Like X-10, {{it had been}} designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers.

The problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fortunately, DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this over-engineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.|$|E
