5|$|A four-track Flatbush Avenue line to Emmons Avenue in <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay, {{before turning}} west to Surf Avenue in Coney Island via Emmons Avenue. Service to Floyd Bennett Field would be {{provided}} with a branch via Flatbush Avenue.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{wildlife}} {{can be found in}} and around San Antonio Bay. According to Texas Parks and Wildlife, the following fish have been caught in the bay: palmetto bass, striped bass, hardhead catfish, black drum, red drum, crevalle jack, southern kingfish, ladyfish, lefteye flounder, pinfish, spotted seatrout, and the <b>sheepshead.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plankton support {{marine life}} {{including}} oysters, shrimp and other invertebrates, and bait-fish species including menhaden and mullet, {{which in turn}} support larger fish and mammal species that populate the local waterways. Popular sport fish in the Hilton Head Island area include the red drum (or spot tail bass), spotted sea trout, <b>sheepshead,</b> cobia, tarpon, and various shark species.|$|E
5|$|Service on the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line {{would be}} {{extended}} down Nostrand Avenue to Voorhies Avenue in <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay as a two-track line. The extension would be constructed as a subway until Avenue T, {{when it would}} emerges an elevated line to Voorhies Avenue. It would have cost $22,700,000.|$|E
5|$|The center {{tracks on}} the IND Sixth Avenue Line dead {{end at the}} curve from Houston Street to Essex Street; these were planned to {{continue}} through a new East River tunnel to Williamsburg and south to the proposed Utica Avenue line towards <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay.|$|E
5|$|Some lines {{proposed}} {{under the}} Contracts were not built, most notably an IRT line to Marine Park, Brooklyn (at {{what is now}} Kings Plaza) under either Utica Avenue, using a brand-new line, or Nostrand Avenue and Flatbush Avenue, using the then-new IRT Nostrand Avenue Line. There were also alternate plans for the Nostrand Avenue Line to continue down Nostrand Avenue to <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay.|$|E
5|$|The Environmental Protection Agency has {{designated}} the Corpus Christi Bay system as an estuary of national significance. More than 234 {{species of fish}} {{are found in the}} bay, including the Gafftopsail catfish, Hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, Atlantic cutlassfish, Black drum, Red drum, Southern flounder, Crevalle jack, Ladyfish, Inshore lizardfish, Atlantic midshipman, Silver perch, Pinfish, Smooth puffer, Scaled sardine, Bighead searobin, Sand seatrout, Spotted seatrout, <b>Sheepshead,</b> Gray snapper, Common snook, and the Tripletail.|$|E
5|$|High winds {{brought down}} {{telegraph}} wires {{and left the}} city almost entirely cut off from communication with outside locations. At Coney Island, the storm completely destroyed many buildings, walkways, piers, and beach resorts. Brighton Beach was hit particularly hard. The raging seas swept inland, washing out tracks of the Marine Railway. Bathing houses were moved a great distance by the cyclone. Near the <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay, Emmons Avenue was heavily damaged. Further to the east, at Greenport, numerous yachts were wrecked and scattered. Corn crops on land were ruined and fruit trees lost their fruits.|$|E
5|$|Laguna Madre {{is home to}} more finfish than {{anywhere}} else on the Texas coast, with such species as blue catfish, hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, black drum, red drum, southern flounder, alligator gar, houndfish, crevalle jack, southern kingfish, ladyfish, Atlantic midshipman, mojarras, striped mullet, pinfish, Florida pompano, smooth butterfly ray, spotted seatrout, blacktip shark, <b>sheepshead,</b> bigmouth sleeper, gray snapper, common snook, southern stargazer, southern stingray and tripletail. Many fowl migrate and live around the lagoon including 75% of all redhead ducks. Other birds in the area include the peregrine falcon, piping plover, roseate spoonbill, long-billed curlew, crane, egret and the brown pelican. Sea turtles and dolphins {{can be found in}} the bay, while cattle, white-tailed deer, nilgai and bobcats can sometimes be seen near the shore.|$|E
5|$|Smith also {{purchased}} and raced Thoroughbred horses {{under the name}} Pleasant Valley Stable. His racing colors during the early 1890s were royal-purple and canary yellow. Smith's brother, Bill, became his principal horse trainer during the 1890s and early 1900s. One of his most successful horses was a two-year-old bay colt named King Cadmus. Smith purchased King Cadmus as a yearling in 1890 for $4,000 at the stable dispersal sale of the late August Belmont. The colt was a son of Kingfisher and was a full brother to another popular racehorse named King Crab. The horse only won two races in his entire racing career, but Smith won $195,000 from Cadmus' two victories. The first win occurred on September 3, 1891 at <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay Race Track and resulted in Smith winning approximately $115,000, which was the largest payout from a horse race recorded in the US at that time. Cadmus' other win occurred at Morris Park Racetrack in 1892 with Smith netting another $80,000. King Cadmus was a fast runner {{but he had a}} vicious temperament, seriously injuring several of Smith's employees, in addition to weak legs and was sold as a three-year-old in 1892.|$|E
5|$|In Brooklyn, several {{extensions}} were {{proposed to}} serve the then-burgeoning areas of Mill Basin and Spring Creek. The Rogers Junction on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line was a serious traffic bottleneck during the rush hours due to the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line tracks' at-grade junctions with the bi-level IRT Eastern Parkway Line. The Rogers Junction {{would have to be}} reconstructed with flying junctions to increase capacity for several extensions. The initial plan had the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line would be extended past Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College along Flatbush Avenue to Avenue U at Kings Plaza. Other plans had the line extended along Nostrand Avenue from Avenue H, where the exiting tunnel ends, to <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay at Avenue W or Voorhies Avenue; this second plan had been proposed as part of the line's original construction. The Nostrand Avenue plan, Route 29–C, which was approved by the Board of Estimate on June 3, 1969, would have had three stations added at Kings Highway, Avenue R, and Avenue W, with a storage yard constructed south of Avenue W. A branch of the Eastern Parkway line, the Utica Avenue Line or Route 57–B, was also proposed to be extended to Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U, however via Utica Avenue, which was also a long-planned extension. There would have been four stops on the line. The stations would have been at Winthrop Street, with an exit at Rutland Road, at Kings Highway, with an exit/entrance at Glenwood Road, but none at King Highway, and a terminal station at Kings Plaza and Avenue U. The stop at Kings Highway would have had a connection to the line running via the Bay Ridge Branch, and it would have had an exit at East 48th Street. The IRT New Lots Line in East New York, meanwhile, would be extended southerly through the Livonia Yard to Flatlands Avenue; this line would run at ground level.|$|E

25|$|Storm {{damage from}} Hurricane Sandy forced {{the waters of}} <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay to overflow, causing the Russian themed Cherry Hill Gourmet Market (located {{at the site of}} the former Lundy's Restaurant) street level water damage {{resulting}} in tons of spoiled food. During the post-hurricane cleanup the food had to be discarded, but the Lundy's Building otherwise survived. The front of Masal's Cafe looking out on <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay at Lundy's Landing Shopping Plaza (the current name of the Lundy's building, which now hosts several restaurants and businesses) shows the high height of the water level entering the Lundy's structure at the peak of Hurricane Sandy.|$|E

25|$|The closest New York City Subway {{stations}} are the Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College {{station on the}} IRT Nostrand Avenue Line in Midwood, and the Avenue U and Kings Highway stations on the BMT Brighton Line in <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay and Midwood respectively.|$|E
25|$|On January 18, 2010, Coney Island-bound {{service was}} {{restored}} at Avenue U and Neck Road. The Manhattan-bound platforms were closed for rebuilding until October 25 and all northbound trains operated on the express track from <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay to Kings Highway.|$|E
25|$|Leavitt's {{design work}} on estates {{eventually}} {{led him to}} other far-flung commissions. After designing a home for Foxhall Kenne, for instance, Leavitt subsequently designed several race courses for Kenne, an equestrian and race track owner, including the Empire City Race Track, {{as well as the}} tracks at Saratoga, <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay, Belmont Park, Toronto, Montreal and Winnipeg.|$|E
25|$|Matilda's father, Anthony, {{opened up}} a barber shop in <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay {{before the turn of}} the century. At about the time of Lombardi's birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry's shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|The line {{now runs}} on an earthen {{embankment}} with local stations at Avenue H, Avenue J and Avenue M, an express station at Kings Highway, local stops at Avenue U and (Gravesend) Neck Road, and an express station at <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay (formerly Shore Road). All {{of the station}} houses for these stops are located beneath the tracks at street level.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the MTA {{announced}} that it would reconstruct seven stations between Newkirk Avenue and Neck Road, inclusive. On December 8, 2008, {{the first phase of the}} Brighton Line Station Reconstruction Project began. The Coney Island-bound platforms of Avenue U and Neck Road were closed for rebuilding and all southbound trains ran on the express track from Kings Highway to <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Irving Lundy started a {{business}} selling clams out of a pushcart. By 1907, he had opened a clam bar built on stilts over <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay, closing it when the city built a new bulkhead at that location. Lundy, with several family members, subsequently built the formal restaurant, located at 1901 Emmons Avenue, in 1934.|$|E
25|$|The borough {{also has}} shorter bus lanes to {{facilitate}} operations at key destinations. On eastbound Oriental Boulevard between Jaffrey and Norfolk Streets in <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay, a bus lane for Kingsborough Community College serves the B1 and B49 routes. In Canarsie, Rockaway Parkway has a bus lane between Glenwood Road and Flatlands Avenue for B42 buses making {{connections with the}} Canarsie-Rockaway Parkway subway station. In Prospect Heights, Flatbush Avenue has bus lanes at Grand Army Plaza, which host the B41 service.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, the New York State Legislature {{created the}} Brooklyn Grade Crossing Elimination Commission (BGCEC) to {{eliminate}} grade all grade crossings on the Brighton Beach Line and the Bay Ridge Line of the Long Island Rail Road. The city {{was supposed to}} cover half of the costs, not exceeding $1,000,000, while the railroads were to cover {{the other half of}} the costs. The work started on December 30, 1905, and was completed in 1908. A short piece of two-tracked elevated railroad was built from the ramp connecting to the Fulton Street Elevated as far as Park Place, where the original 1878 open cut began. From the end of that original cut south of Church Avenue, the line was wholly rebuilt as a four-track railroad with express and local stations to a point south of Neptune Avenue at the border of Coney Island, continuing along its original right-of-way to Brighton Beach station. The portion from Church Avenue to Avenue H was placed in a depressed open cut, while the portion from Avenue H to south of <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay was raised onto an earthen embankment, primarily with earth excavated from the open-cut portion and from the Bay Ridge Improvement of the Long Island Rail Road. The separation of the railroad grade allowed the line's trolley wire north of <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay to be replaced with ground-level third rail.|$|E
25|$|Church {{attendance}} was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory {{few hours of}} dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark's Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant ethnic discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay.|$|E
25|$|Sands {{attended}} Bahamas Academy in Nassau as a {{child and}} was later educated in the United States, studying at <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay High School in Brooklyn, New York before graduating from Penn State University. As a teenager he excelled in the sprints and a 19-year-old Sands was chosen for the 1972 Summer Olympics team. At the competition he was a quarter-finalists in the 100 metres and ran in the heats of the 200 metres and the 4×100 metres relay. Sands took over the mantle of the top Bahamian sprinter from Tom Robinson, who won multiple medals at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Skat was {{developed}} by the members of the Brommesche Tarok-Gesellschaft between 1810 and 1817 in Altenburg, in what is now the State of Thuringia, Germany, based on the three-player game of Tarock, also known as Tarot, and the four-player game of Schafkopf (equivalent to the American game <b>Sheepshead).</b> It has become the most loved and widely played German card game, especially in German-speaking regions. In the earliest known form of the game, the player in the first seat was dealt twelve cards and the other two players ten each. He then made two discards, constituting the Skat, and announced a contract. But the main innovation of this new game was that of the bidding process.|$|E
25|$|With {{the death}} of Austin Corbin in June 1896 the LIRR was reorganized {{and the decline of}} the Manhattan Beach line started. Various rapid transit lines in Brooklyn had been unified under the Brooklyn Rapid Transit (BRT) system, and a {{connection}} was built between the Fulton Street Elevated and the Brighton Line, which was long opposed by Corbin, and this led to a decline in revenue for the Manhattan Beach. The LIRR and BRT agreed to keep out of the other's business after an agreement was made on April 1, 1899. The BRT's acquisition of all of the Brooklyn Elevated railroads was no longer opposed by the LIRR, and a connection at <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay was built so that trains from the Brighton Line could go to the Manhattan Beach Hotel. Control of the Culver Line was given to the BRT soon afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{line was}} a two-tracked high-speed surface steam railroad operating from Bedford Station, at Atlantic Avenue near Franklin Avenue in the City of Brooklyn, {{at which point}} it made a physical connection to the Long Island Rail Road's Atlantic Branch. From Bedford the line ran on a surface private right-of-way several blocks south to Park Place, which it crossed at grade, and then in an open cut with street overpasses through what is now Crown Heights and Flatbush, as far as Church Lane (now Church Avenue) in the Town and Village of Flatbush. From that point the line continued on the surface to a point at current Beverley Road between Marlborough Road (East 15th Street) and East 16th Street, curving southeast and running on the surface between {{the lines of the}} latter streets through the Towns of Flatbush and Gravesend to <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay, then turning southerly to reach the beach at Brighton Beach on Coney Island in the Town of Gravesend.|$|E
25|$|Since {{only one}} window in McEwen's car was open, {{and none of}} them had been shattered, Seedman knew the shot had to have been fired from <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay or the nearby area, and that due to the {{distance}} and the car's speed, it was probably not intentional. He ordered detectives and uniformed officers to search the dunes and marshes for a possible shell casing. After 2,400 people were interviewed and several other leads came to nothing, he pointed at a spot on the map and told his detectives to look for people who owned boats. That led to the shooter—a local gas station owner who had been on his boat that morning taking target practice at a floating beer can. One of his bullets had ricocheted off the water's surface and killed McEwen. A grand jury ruled it an accident, and no homicide charges were brought, although the shooter was fined $100 for violating firearms laws with the rifle.|$|E
25|$|Johnson was {{an early}} example of the celebrity athlete in the modern era, {{appearing}} regularly {{in the press and}} later on radio and in motion pictures. He earned considerable sums endorsing various products, including patent medicines, and indulged several expensive hobbies such as automobile racing and tailored clothing, as well as purchasing jewelry and furs for his wives. He even challenged champion racer Barney Oldfield to a match auto race at the <b>Sheepshead</b> Bay, Brooklyn, New York one mile (1.6km) dirt track. Oldfield, far more experienced, easily out-distanced Johnson, ending any thoughts the boxer might have had about becoming a professional driver. Once, when he was pulled over for a $50 speeding ticket (a large sum at the time), he gave the officer a $100 bill; when the officer protested that he couldn't make change for that much, Johnson told him to keep the change, as {{he was going to make}} his return trip at the same speed. Johnson was also interested in opera (his favorite being Il Trovatore) and in history — he was an admirer of Napoleon Bonaparte, believing him to have risen from a similar origin to his own. In 1920, Johnson opened a night club in Harlem; he sold it three years later to a gangster, Owney Madden, who renamed it the Cotton Club.|$|E
