5|$|Mortal Kombat II {{proved to}} be an {{enormous}} commercial success and even a cultural phenomenon. WMS Industries, owner of Midway at the time, reported its 1993 sales in the quarter ending December 31 rose to $101 million from $86 million and <b>said</b> <b>much</b> of its revenue gain was related to the sale of the arcade version of MKII. By 1996, the number of arcade machines sold approached 25,000 units; at that time, arcade games that sold 5,000 units were considered strong titles (Midway printed special T-shirts to celebrate 300 machines being manufactured in one day) and an arcade cabinet cost $3,0004,000. MKII was considered an arcade game of the year, taking over from the original Mortal Kombat.|$|E
5|$|Varno said he {{received}} uncredited assistance from {{his friends and}} fellow screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith, the latter of whom won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Defiant Ones (1958). Varno ran lines and ideas by both men and sought advice. Smith in particular inspired lines for the speech made by the monster {{at the end of}} the film, in which the creature discusses how the human characters consider him the embodiment of evil simply because he is different from them. Varno <b>said</b> <b>much</b> of that dialogue from Smith, however, ended up getting cut from the final film. One of the primary themes of the film, as embodied in John Corcoran's attempts to defend the alien creature, was that simply because someone or something is ugly or different does not necessarily make it evil. However, the script also followed a common trait of most horror films of the 1950s that even somewhat understandable monsters are not entirely sympathetic, and the Blood Beast creature proves itself evil by impregnating Corcoran against his will and pursuing world domination.|$|E

25|$|At the {{division}} of the land of Israel among the seven tribes not yet provided for, the lot of Zebulun was third. The tribe's territory started with Sarid (Joshua 19:10), which is supposed to have been Tel Shadud, some five miles southwest of Nazareth. Zebulun's boundaries have not been made out. Of the nineteen proper names that the book of Joshua gives to guide us, only Bethlehem of Galilee (Beit lahm, seven miles northwest of Nazareth) can be identified with certainty, although the archaeological site Tel Hanaton is associated with the city Hanaton listed as the boundary with Asher. The historian Josephus assigns to Zebulun the land near to Carmel and the sea, as far as the Lake of Genesareth. To its northwest lay Asher, to the southeast Issachar. It included a part of the Jezreel Valley, and the great highway from the sea to the lake. Within the territory of Zebulun, Jesus was raised, and did and <b>said</b> <b>much</b> that is narrated in the Gospels, especially in the Synoptics, about his Galilean ministry.|$|E

[...] According to Linda Oakley, spouse of bassist Oakley, the group held a New Year's Eve party going into 1970 where they, at midnight, joined together in a chorus of [...] "Will the Circle Be Unbroken".

500|$|In a January 2013 {{interview}} with Vanity Fair, costume designer Sharen Davis <b>said</b> <b>much</b> of the film's wardrobe {{was inspired by}} spaghetti westerns and other works of art. For Django's wardrobe, Davis and Tarantino watched the television series Bonanza and referred to it frequently. The pair even hired the hatmaker who designed the hat worn by the Bonanza character Little Joe, played by Michael Landon. Davis described Django's look as a [...] "rock-n-roll take on the character". Django's sunglasses were inspired by Charles Bronson's character in The White Buffalo (1977). Davis used Thomas Gainsborough's 1770 oil painting The Blue Boy as a reference for Django's valet outfit.|$|E

[...] Davidson described her as being [...] "not at all assertive... never thrust her ideas on anyone. [...] she behaved in fact rather like someone who was a fully convinced member of some unusual religious sect, or perhaps, of the Freemasons, but never on any account got into arguments about it in public."

500|$|The episode {{received}} a somewhat positive reaction from reviewers. IGN Robert Canning was representative of this, {{and gave it}} a [...] "good" [...] rating of 7.5 out of 10: [...] "The episode as a whole was fine for what it was, touching on most of the hallmarks of a decent prom episode", though he [...] "was a bit let down by the final moments of the episode as [...] felt it too quickly tried to pin a happy ending on everything". He also called the drama around Rachel and Jesse and Quinn and Finn [...] "superficial stuff", a view shared by Meghan Brown of The Atlantic who <b>said</b> <b>much</b> of the drama [...] "felt shallow and forced", except for the first Kurt and Karofsky scene, which she described as [...] "painful and poignant". Brown's colleague, Kevin Fallon, stated that [...] "Like prom, this episode was Glee at its best and its worst", and MTV Aly Semigran thought that it [...] "wasn't as strong—or cohesive—as last week's 'Rumours, but said it [...] "certainly had its moments, especially some notably hilarious ones." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "If the entirety of this show were like the last 10 minutes of this episode, it just might be the best show on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|On Friday morning 21 June, seven {{prisoners were}} brought to the bar on a similar charge as on Tuesday (breaking into the house of Rebecca Waddelow in Littleport and {{stealing}} personal property and money). The prisoners all pleaded not guilty. Mr Gurney addressed the jury explaining that these were the same persons indicted on Tuesday for the same offence. He explained to the jury that the earlier indictment incorrectly described the house to be the property of Rebecca Waddelow, leading to the prisoners' acquittal. He also explained that in the original indictment, other persons had been charged, but as these other persons had since been convicted of capital offences, they had been removed from the indictment. The witness were all brought forward again and made their statements. They <b>said</b> <b>much</b> the same as previously, though this took much of the day. In summing up, Mr Abbott went on a length closing with [...] "the duty which it belonged to them [...] to execute – confident that, from experience which the court had now of them, their verdict would be such as good sense would dictate, and the public justice of the country require". It took the jury fiveminutes to find Walker, Butcher and Crow guilty and Nicholas, Wilson and Jefferson not guilty.|$|E

500|$|The video also {{received}} comparisons to Spears' [...] "Criminal", which was released {{two days before}} [...] "We Found Love", on October 17, 2011. Critics noted that both videos were filmed in the United Kingdom and caused controversy there, both contain scenes of sex, violence, and crime, and both featured [...] "bad boy" [...] stereotypes and evoke the personal lives of the artists. Katherine St Asaph of PopDust noted that although most pop stars release videos that draw from their personal lives, they do not make the viewer uncomfortable. The same cannot be said for Spears and Rihanna, {{regardless of whether they}} have moved on from past situations, because the discussion about them has not. St Asaph also expressed that neither Spears nor Rihanna <b>said</b> <b>much</b> about the parallels to their lives, but that they do not need to—their videos are much more effective than anything the singers could reveal in an interview. Rae Alexandra of the SF Weekly wrote that both videos feature an anti-British sentiment and that the villains in the video, Rihanna's boyfriend and Spears' policemen, are British, whereas Spears' savior in her video is an American criminal. Alexandra noted that Spears and Rihanna chose to film their grittiest videos in a country with a lower crime rate than the United States. According to her, the videos continue with a tradition of xenophobic portrayals of British people as villains by American film and video directors.|$|E
500|$|St Asaph {{explained}} that the only interpretation of the video lies on the opinion of each viewer about Spears's personal life, and how active a role each person imagines she plays in it.

500|$|According to The Independents Holly Rubenstein, Kaleidoscope Dream is [...] "widely {{considered}} a leading example" [...] of alternative R; Miguel himself {{described it as}} [...] "avant soul". In the opinion of NPR's Frannie Kelley, the record combined R, pop, funk, rock and soul genres. Its music features sparse production, eccentric details, thick bass lines, buzzing synthesizers, and hazy, reverbed sounds. Allmusic's Andy Kellman found the album [...] "funkier and weirder" [...] than All I Want Is You and observed an [...] "illusory atmosphere ... intensified by some unexpected touches". Maura Johnston <b>said</b> <b>much</b> of it [...] "sounds, as the title might suggest, fractal." [...] As an R album, The A.V. Clubs Evan Rytlewski said, Kaleidoscope Dream deviated from genre conventions by minimizing the influence of hip hop; Jim DeRogatis believed it drew heavily on psychedelic rock and psychedelic pop. Music writers compared the album's style to Prince, Alex Macpherson of The Guardian perceives a [...] "headier aesthetic" [...] than on All I Want Is You, with [...] "faded psychedelia" [...] and [...] "intimate experiments in Purple Rain-esque rock". Writing about the record for WNYC, Gretta Cohn claimed Miguel was [...] "redefining what contemporary R can be". Miguel said he [...] "definitely think it's an R record, though other people may not ... are so conditioned to expect certain things out of current R, and it's about following a formula. But R was once live music, it was psychedelic, it was rock, it was funk, and all these genres stem from soul music ... There would be no hip-hop or rock without R It was {{important for me to}} be true to what R is, and that is soulful." ...|$|E

500|$|Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 92, based on 14 reviews. It was {{called one of}} Cooder's best records by Uncut magazine's Nigel Williamson and Martin Chilton of The Daily Telegraph. AllMusic editor Thom Jurek deemed it Cooder's [...] "most overtly political album ... {{and one of his}} funniest, most musically compelling ones, too", while Daniel Paton from musicOMH <b>said</b> <b>much</b> of the record was [...] "highly satisfying satire (although also often sensitive and affecting), combining Cooder’s transparent love {{for a wide range of}} roots music with his engagement with politics." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent was impressed by how Cooder used similar characters throughout the songs in new ways, calling the album his best since 2005's Chávez Ravine. Cooder received comparisons to Woody Guthrie in reviews written by Phil Sutcliffe of Mojo, who found the lyrics sharply written, and Neil Spencer from The Observer, who called Cooder [...] "a Woody Guthrie for our times" [...] and the record [...] "a fierce state-of-the-nation album". In the opinion of PopMatters critic Philip Majorins, the record would not have a significant impact because of the public's predominantly commercial tastes and a [...] "cynical" [...] cultural climate, but concluded, [...] "Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down could have tremendous cathartic power for [...] who are aware of history and its knack for repeating itself. For those who are willing, this is a good place to start an education." ...|$|E
