40|$|Colour Therapy is a {{complementary}} therapy {{for which there}} is evidence dating back thousands of years to the ancient cultures of Egypt, China and India. Colour is simply light of varying wavelengths, thus each colour has its own particular wavelength and energy. "Colour affects our life. Colour is physical [...] we see it. Colour communicates [...] we recieve information from the language of colour. Colour is emotional [...] it evokes our feeling. " 1 The energy relating to each of the seven <b>spectrum</b> <b>colours</b> of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, resonates with the energy of each of the seven main chakras/energy centres of the body. "The brightness of the colour of a substance depends very little on the preponderance of one colour vibration, of one spectrum line, in the light it reflects. " 2 If you can imagine the chakras as a set of cogs/wheels, they are rather like the workings of a clock or an engine; each cog/wheel needs to move smoothly for the clock/engine to work properly. Thus good health and wellbeing is achieved by a balance of all these energies. Balance of the energy in each of the body’s chakras is very important for health and wellbeing. Colour therapy can help to re-balance and/or stimulate these energies by applying the appropriate colour to the body and therefore re-balance our chakras...|$|E

These lamps often contain rare-earth {{additives}} (in our case dysprosium iodide) which radiate very efficiently in the visible <b>spectrum.</b> <b>Colour</b> separation {{is a problem}} in these lamps; this is caused by axial segregation of these additives as a result of diffusion and convection. To vary the effect of convection, parabolic flights were performed with micro-gravity (0 g) and hyper-gravity (∼ 1. 8 g) phases. During these flights, the atomic dysprosium density was measured by means of laser absorption spectroscopy. In addition, the lamp voltage, which is strongly influenced by the total amount of Dy in the lamp, was measured. The Dy density and axial segregation are dependent on the gravity. Thedynamic lamp behaviour during the parabolas was investigated: the dysprosium density and lamp voltage followed the gravity variations. When entering the micro-gravity phase, the axial diffusion time constant is the slowest time constant; it is proportional to the mercury pressure in the lamp...|$|R

The resultant displacement magnitude was measured for the prosthetic components; framework and implants, owing {{to the difficulty of}} examining the direction of the framework and implants movement by merely looking at the stress results. Results showed that higher stress values were found within the bones and prosthetic components on working side for the extramaxillary as compared to the intrasinus approach, especially under the most posterior loading, L 4 due to the cantilever effect. The prosthetic components in the extramaxillary also exhibited higher displacement magnitudes than those in the intrasinus when loading occurred in the anterior and the most posterior regions...|$|R

We calculate synthetic UBV RIJHKLM images, integrated <b>spectra</b> and <b>colours</b> for {{the disk}} galaxy formation models of Samland & Gerhard (2002), from redshift z = 4 to z = 0. Two models are considered, an accretion model based on ΛCDM structure formation simulations, and a classical collapse model {{in a dark}} matter halo. Both models provide the star formation history and dynamics of the baryonic component within a three-dimensional chemo-dynamical description. To convert to <b>spectra</b> and <b>colours,</b> we use the latest, metallicitycalibrated spectral library of Westera et al. (2002), including internal absorption. As a first application, we compare the derived colours with Hubble Deep Field North bulge colours and find good agreement. With our model, we disentangle metallicity effects and absorption effects on the integrated colours, and find that absorption effects are dominant for z < 1. 5. Furthermore, we confirm the quality of mK as a mass tracer, and find indications for a correlation between (J − K) 0 and metallicity gradients...|$|R

During 200 hours of exposure in three different environment, the UV absorbance, the colour difference, the yellowness, and the absorption of –NH/–OH and –C=O bands in FT-IR spectra of the films increase gradually with increasing exposure time, respectively, and the films exposed to the three environments have different colour difference, yellowness index, UV-Vis spectra, and FT-IR spectra. The films are vulnerable to degradation and yellowing in the following environment order: O 3 < UV < UV/O 3. After exposure to UV radiation or O 3 atmosphere, some degradation products and blisters are formed on the film surface. After exposure to UV/O 3 integrated environment, there are strip blisters and micro-cracks on the film surface, and exists an obvious synergism between UV radiation and O 3 atmosphere in accelerating the ageing of the polyurethane films...|$|R
