Point D falls to location D*, through a distance w 0 / 2, so, and for point C to remain in contact with the floating span, the wing must rotate about axis AB* through an angle ϕ, given by Eq. (2). Point D’ rises to location D’*, through a distance w 0 / 2, and the wing rotates about the axis A’B’* to remain in contact with the floating span at point C’. The total vertical displacement of a point along either of the bearing yokes consists of the displacement due to the pitch of the wing (either upward or downward) plus a component due to the rotation of the wing about either axis AB* or axis A’B’*. The motion can be thought of as one side pitching up, and the other, down.|$|E

These days supplementary cementecious materials are used for enhancement of concrete properties. Use of Nano materials is gaining importance due to its vital characteristics, these materials help in developing high performance concrete (Zhang Zenan, et al 2006). In this paper, the use of steel fibers instead of the reinforcement steel bars in the continuous nano-high strength concrete (NHSC) slab panel was experimentally investigated. Tests were carried out on three two-span slab panels under mid <b>span</b> <b>point</b> loads and simply supported at the panels end. The first slab was reinforced by steel bars to resist the negative moments near the internal supports while the other two slab panels were reinforced by steel fibers only of percentage of volume fraction (1 and 2. 0) in this zone, without negative steel bars. 5 % nano-SiO 2 (NS) and 15 % of silica fume (SF) contents were used. The load-deflection relationship for the tested slab spans is determined, the first crack load, failure load and deflections were recorded. Also a comparison between the results obtained from this study and that obtained from other study of two continuous slabs made of self compacted concrete (SCC) was made, one of these slabs was reinforced by steel bars near the interior supports and the other is reinforced by steel fibers of (1 % and 2 %) in this zone.

Standard solutions start with the closed form solution of the Vlasov thin-walled beam theory for {{the case of a}} simply supported beam under uniform moments, and modify the solution to accommodate various moment distributions through moment gradient expressions. The Vlasov theory solution {{is based on the assumption}} that cross-sectional distortional effects have a negligible effect on the predicted elastic critical moment. The present study systematically examines the validity of the Vlasov assumption related to cross-section distortion through a parametric study. A series of elastic shell finite element eigen-value buckling analyses is conducted on simply supported beams subject to uniform moments, linear moments and mid <b>span</b> <b>point</b> loads as well as cantilevers subject to top flange loading acting at the tip. Cross-sectional dimensions are selected to represent structural steel cross-section geometries used in practice. Particular attention is paid to model end connection details commonly used in practice involving moment connections with two pairs of stiffeners, simply supported ends with a pair of transverse stiffeners, simply supported ends with cleat angle details, and built in fixation at cantilever roots. The critical moments obtained from the FEA are compared to those based on conventional critical moment equations in various Standards and published solutions. The effects of web slenderness, flange slenderness, web height to flange width ratio, and span to height ratios on the critical moment ratio are systematically quantified. For some combinations of section geometries and connection details, it is shown that present solutions derived from the Vlasov theory can overestimate the lateral torsional buckling resistance for beams...|$|E

40|$|The oxygen {{isotopes}} {{ratios of}} benthic foraminifera and detailed radiocarbon {{ages of the}} organic matter of an over 15 m long sediment core from the outer Niger delta allow us to date the oxygen isotope stage boundaries 1 / 2 to 11500 (+/- 650) years BP, 2 / 3 to approximately 23000 (+/- 2000) years BP. The composition of the predominantly terrigenous clays and accessory pelagic fossils reflects {{the evolution of the}} climate over the southwestern Sahel zone and the response of the Eastern Tropical Atlantic to these climatic fluctuations during the Late Quaternary. The dilution of the pelagic fossil concentrations by the terrigenous material and the oxygen isotopes ratios of planktonic foraminifera indicate large fluctuations in the freshwater discharge from the Niger, with high precipitations over the drainage area of this river from 4500 (+/- 300) to 11500 (+/- 650) years BP and from 11800 (+(- 600) to 13000 (+/- 600) years BP while the time intervals in between were as dry as today. Relative increase of kaolinite during wet phases and the association of smectite, chlorite and attapulgite during dry ones characterize the response of the weathering in the Niger drainage basins to the climatic fluctuations. The occurrence of 10 - 14 A mixed-layers prior to 26000 years BP is correlated with moderate alteration of the crystalline substratum outcrops from the middle-lower part of the Niger Basin. High quartz concentrations are particularly typical for the transition between oxygen isotope stages 1 and 2 at the inception of heavy precipitations in the southern Sahel zone. Sedimentation rates were quite constant, 30 - 35 cm/ 1000 years; they became unusually large {{at the beginning of the}} Holocene from 10900 (+/- 650) to 11500 (+/- 650) years BP where they reached more than 600 cm/ 1000 years. Bottom waters around 1100 m depth in the Gulf of Guinea responded to changes in paleo-oceanography of the entire Atlantic Ocean as well as to local influences. Abnormal carbon isotopes ratios and the drastic changes from a highly diversified fauna (during stages 2 and 3. and during the last part of stage 1 after approx. 7000 years BP) to a poorly diversified fauna in the intervenin time <b>span</b> <b>point</b> to the development of a local benthic environment which cannot easily be compared with the corresponding continental and slope environments of the entire Atlantic Ocean...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{reinforced}} concrete slabs {{have been exposed}} to blast and impact loading in order to access modes of slab behaviour under these extreme dynamic loadings. Two sizes of specimens were used; small scale slabs modelled the large slabs at 1 : 2. 5 scale. Impact loads were produced by a free falling hammer impacting coaxially onto a cylindrical bar of steel placed at rest in the centre of the slab. The steel bar was instrumented with electrical strain gauges which recorded the stress pulses produced by the impact. Blast loads were produced using explosive charges made of Plastic Explosive PE 4. In most cases the charge used was hemispherical in shape and was placed centrally above the slab at close range standoffs, i. e. up to 10 times the radius of the charge. Additional blast tests were conducted in order to monitor the transient and spatial pressure distribution across the slab by using the pressure gauges placed in replica steel slab. Transient deflections of the slabs under both types of load were obtained using long stroke displacement transducers, whilst transient strains in the steel reinforcement of the slabs were obtained using electrical resistance strain gauges bonded to the steel bars at mid <b>span</b> <b>point.</b> A rotating prism high speed camera was used to film the damage on some of the small scale specimens at rates of up to 10, 000 pictures per second. The Hopkinson pressure bar tests were used to obtain the dynamic characteristics of the concretes used at high rates of loading. Differeent concrete mixes were used for the 1 : 1 and 1 : 2. 5 scale slabs. An analytical function of the spatial and transient blast pressure distribution based on the detonation pressure of PE 4 was established. This is in close agreement to experimentally measured results. The nature of the local and overall failure are discussed, and the time sequence of the slab failure is established for the case of explosive loading. The crack pattern that occurs soon after the explosion in area of local failure has been established from the high speed films whilst the overall deflected shape was obtained from the displacement vs time records. After test scab sizes and slab perforations were used to establish a relation between the slab thickness, amount of explosive and the slab damage in respect to scabbing and perforation. The displacement records and the shape of after test damage provided the basis for comments on "gravity neglected - the ultimate strength" modelling law that was employed in this research...|$|E

40|$|The LiteSteel Beam (LSB) {{is a new}} hollow flange section {{developed}} in Australia with a unique geometry consisting of torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges and a relatively slender web. The LSB is subjected to a relatively new Lateral Distortional Buckling (LDB) mode when used as flexural members. Unlike the commonly observed lateral torsional buckling, lateral distortional buckling of LSBs is characterised by cross sectional change due to web distortion. Lateral distortional buckling causes significant moment capacity reduction for LSBs with intermediate spans. Therefore a detailed investigation was undertaken to determine the methods of reducing the effects of lateral distortional buckling in LSB flexural members. For this purpose the use of web stiffeners was investigated using finite element analyses of LSBs with different web stiffener spacing and sizes. It {{was found that the}} use of 5 mm steel plate stiffeners welded or screwed to the inner faces of the top and bottom flanges at third <b>span</b> <b>points</b> considerably reduced the lateral distortional buckling effects in LSBs.
