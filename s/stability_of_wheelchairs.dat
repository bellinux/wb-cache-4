40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{graduate}} thesis was {{to develop}} a mathematical model of a standard wheelchair with a humanoid model while the human is firmly secured in the wheelchair. In the United States, there are, on average, 50 wheelchair related deaths and 36, 500 wheelchair related emergency room visits every year. About 3 out of every 4 of these incidents can be attributed to wheelchair instability, or more explicitly, the wheelchair’s ability to remain upright when moving up or down a slope or undergoing a collision with its surroundings. There have been investigations to examine the static and dynamic <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheelchairs</b> in the past, but there is the need for a published theoretical analysis of wheelchairs under a range of experimental conditions. In order to analyze the stability of a wheelchair, Bruno stimulated a variety of tests by placing the wheelchair on a stable platform for static testing and by rolling the wheelchair down the ramp, for dynamic testing. The static stability was determined by measuring the maximum angle that the system of the wheelchair and human could be tilted without tipping over. Dynamic stability was evaluated by changing in the angle of the ramp that the wheelchair was pushed on and by noting any issues with the wheelchair. The results of the analysis showed a correlation with the experimental values and the mathematical model proved to be accurate in the case of static stability. The dynamic stability results showed some accuracy, but did not correlate as effectively with experimental data because of the instability and movement throughout the wheelchair system during dynamic testing conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{influences}} of caster orientations and driving speeds on the reverse directional <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> electric-powered <b>wheelchairs.</b> An experiment was set up to record wheelchair trajectories and ground reaction forces/moments for the front caster wheels and rear wheels when a wheelchair initiates reverse motions at six initial caster orientations and three desired driving speeds. A kinematic model as well as a dynamic model were developed to simulate the wheelchair motion and conduct a parametric study of different factors on wheelchair reverse directional stability. The experimental and simulation results show agreement, both of which indicate that different caster orientations at the start of reverse driving introduce disturbances and the faster the intended speed, the less deviation <b>of</b> the <b>wheelchair</b> from its desired heading. The center of gravity (CG) was also found to be a dominant influence on the reverse directional <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> power <b>wheelchairs.</b> © 2004 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} {{mathematical}} model to the dynamic <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> powered <b>wheelchairs.</b> Dynamic <b>stability</b> is the study of the set of circumstances that causes tipping when a wheelchair strikes an obstacle. Since manual wheelchairs experience more tipping than powered wheelchairs, there are not many prior studies involving the dynamic <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> powered <b>wheelchairs.</b> <b>Stability</b> models can make the wheelchairs safer but manufacturers do not take them into account. These manufacturers and individuals who use wheelchairs could benefit with {{a better understanding of the}} circumstances under which their wheelchairs will experience tipping. Using a complete free-body diagram that showed all of the forces acting on the wheelchair, a mathematical model was developed separately for each of the following situations: accelerating uphill, accelerating downhill, turning, and turning on a sloped surface. Then, Newton’s laws were used to generate force and moment equations. These equations were solved under reasonable assumptions. Integrating these separate models into one, a flow chart was then created to give the final model a structured framework. The result was mathematical models for the dynamic <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> the powered <b>wheelchair</b> in the form of a flowchart. Using this flowchart, very few measurements are required to determine the correct model for a given set of circumstances. Also, turning models for stability were found to be much more complex than the uphill and downhill models...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The {{postural}} <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheelchair</b> users experiencing external perturbations was examined. Rotation of a tilt platform generated {{moments in}} the trunks of subjects seated in a manual wheelchair on the platform. The magnitude and duration of the moments were {{on the order of}} those that might be encountered in the sagittal plane during controlled braking maneuvers in a vehicle. Four subjects with tetraplegia, four with paraplegia, and five controls participated in experimental trials on the platform. As input, four different Disturbance profiles with either a 0. 2 g (gravitational acceleration) or 0. 4 g maximal level were imposed. The majority of the subjects with spinal cord injury lost balance at Disturbance levels below 0. 2 g. The results suggest that the rate of change of the applied perturbation may also affect <b>stability.</b> The use <b>of</b> a <b>stability</b> index based on normalized motion of the center of pressure with respect to the seat showed efficacy in characterizing the response.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model describing {{the effects of}} a human driver on the tipping <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> a powered <b>wheelchair.</b> The tipping stability is measured by the angle of tilt required to induce a loss of contact between any of the wheels <b>of</b> the <b>wheelchair</b> and the ground. Specifically, the effect of moving the centre of gravity of the human driver relative to that <b>of</b> the <b>wheelchair</b> in a controlled manner is shown to improve the tipping stability. Expressions are derived relating the static and dynamic tipping criteria to the position and relative mass of the human. A simple controller is used to demonstrate that this strategy serves to improve tipping stability. 1. Introduction Independence {{is one of the key}} factors which contribute to quality of life.

40|$|AbstractWheelchair racing {{science and}} the {{performance}} of athletes involved in wheelchair racing have developed rapidly in recent years. With increasing interest in this sport, the need arises to identify areas where further research is necessary and cooperation between individuals with various backgrounds is encouraged. Many of the problems facing investigators in this field require knowledge in several areas of science and engineer-ing, which suggests an interdisciplinary approach to these issues. Further progress would also benefit from the development of more quantitative methods for the classification <b>of</b> <b>wheelchair</b> athletes, or a restructuring of the classification system; develop-ment of sophisticated instrumentation for racing wheelchairs; standardization of test procedures and more complete reporting of results of studies; and, more in-depth mathematical model-ing and computer simulation <b>of</b> <b>wheelchair</b> racing.

40|$|Background: Comparative {{effectiveness}} research on wheelchairs available in low-resource areas {{is needed to}} enable effective use of limited funds. Mobility on commonly encountered rolling environments is a key aspect of function. High variation in capacity among wheelchair users can mask changes in mobility because <b>of</b> <b>wheelchair</b> design. A repeated measures protocol in which the participants use one type <b>of</b> <b>wheelchair</b> and then another minimises the impact of individual variation. Objectives: The Aspects <b>of</b> <b>Wheelchair</b> Mobility Test (AWMT) {{was designed to be}} used in repeated measures studies in low-resource areas. It measures the impact <b>of</b> different <b>wheelchair</b> types on physical performance in commonly encountered rolling environments and provides an opportunity for qualitative and quantitative participant response. This study sought to confirm the ability of the AWMT to discern differences in mobility because <b>of</b> <b>wheelchair</b> design. Method: Participants were wheelchair users at a boarding school for students with disabilities in a low-resource area. Each participant completed timed tests on measured tracks on rough and smooth surfaces, in tight spaces and over curbs. Four types <b>of</b> <b>wheelchairs</b> designed for use in low-resource areas were included. Results: The protocol demonstrated the ability to discriminate changes in mobility of individuals because <b>of</b> <b>wheelchair</b> type.
