500|$|During {{sessions}} for Door, Door at Richmond Recorders in Melbourne in January 1979, the Boys Next Door recorded [...] "Shivers". Engineer Tony Cohen suggested that Howard perform the vocals for the track, arguing that {{his voice was}} best fitted for his own songs. However, the band's regular vocalist, Nick Cave, insisted on singing on the recording. Howard said later {{that as a result}} of Cave's vocals, [...] "Shivers" [...] was [...] "interpreted completely differently and now the song, to most peoples' minds, is <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from what I intended it to be". In hindsight, Cave noted that Howard's vocals should have been recorded, as Cave was [...] "never able to do that song justice".|$|E

More recent credits include the first series of Peaky Blinders on BBC2 {{for which he was}} nominated for a BAFTA Craft Award and The Honourable Woman.

Moore said that after that, [...] " [...] was pretty much comfortable with whatever I wanted to do." [...] This new song format was very different from what Portnoy and Matheos originally planned: the already-written long tracks were split into multiple short songs, closer to Moore's project Chroma Key than traditional progressive metal.

Lennon also admired the track, saying of Harrison: [...] "His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together." [...] David Crosby, who introduced Harrison to Shankar's music in 1965, described Harrison's fusion of ideas as [...] "utterly brilliant", adding: [...] "He did it beautifully and tastefully... He did it at absolutely the highest level that he could, and I was extremely proud of him for that." [...] Writing in the [...] "100 Rock Icons" [...] issue of Classic Rock, in 2006, singer Paul Rodgers cited the track to support Harrison's standing as what the magazine called [...] "the Beatles' musical medicine man". Rodgers said: [...] "He introduced me and a generation of people worldwide to {{the wisdom of the}} East.

50|$|The Pelican is much studied {{because it}} has a {{particularly}} active mix of star formation and evolving gas clouds.

5000|$|After a {{four-year}} hiatus, and rumours {{of mental illness}} {{which turned out to}} be nothing more than exaggeration of Cobain's mercury poisoning from fillings in his teeth, the pair returned in 2002 with [...] "The Isness", a record heavily influenced by 1960s and 1970s psychedelia and released under their alias Amorphous Androgynous. It was preceded by Papua New Guinea Translations, a mini album which contained a mixture of remixes of FSOL's track as well as new material from The Isness sessions. The album received mixed press due to the drastic change in sound which was inspired by Cobain's and Dougan's (separate) travels to India and immersion in spiritualism, nevertheless the majority was positive with Muzik magazine offering the album a 6/5 mark and dubbing it [...] "...a white beam of light from heaven..." [...] and other British publications such as The Times, The Guardian and MOJO praising the album and the band's ability to do <b>something</b> so <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from what they had done before.|$|R

The track contains a synth-driven sing-along chorus, and {{was said to}} [...] "hark back to Madonna's early-'90s dance music". Meester told MTV News that the song is [...] "basically about how I can't get any—I can't find anyone to love." [...] In an interview for On Air with Ryan Seacrest on October 13, 2009—where the song was premiered—, Meester said, [...] "I really wanted to make <b>something</b> that's <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from anything that's on the radio right now.

In response to the criticism he said, [...] "I can understand because of people's love of the [...] film that there's this cynicism that I'll come in and trash it, when in fact I have nothing but respect for the film.

500|$|Not all reviews, however, were negative. Nader Elhefnawy at Strange Horizons {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "an interesting experiment".

Mark Yon at SFF World said that while this {{is not one of}} Clarke's best works, [...] "it is still very good". He said that even though it is a collaboration, the book is still recognisably Clarke, [...] "with the same humour, the same enthusiasm, the great flashes of inspiration, the big ideas and the same curious positivism that underlines most of Sir Arthur’s work. ... There is a joy throughout here: a joy of learning, of opening up new opportunities and experiences, and a love of mathematics and science." [...] Michael Berry at the San Francisco Chronicle said that the novel does a [...] "stellar job of conveying some of the intellectual fun that can be had by manipulating math." [...] He said that Sri Lanka, Clarke's home for most of his life, is brought [...] "vividly to life", and that despite some minor flaws, The Last Theorem is a [...] "fitting valedictory for Clarke, one of science fiction's most acclaimed authors, and a reminder of Pohl's great relevance to a genre he has championed for more than 70 years." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of Let the Right One In took place, Cloverfield {{director}} Matt Reeves signed on to write and direct an English-language version for Overture Films and Hammer Films. Hammer Films acquired the rights at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, where Let the Right One In won the [...] "Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature", and Overture films planned to release the film in 2010. Alfredson has expressed unhappiness {{about the idea of}} a remake, saying that [...] "Remakes should be made of movies that aren't very good, that gives you the chance to fix whatever has gone wrong" [...] and expressing concern that the end result would be too mainstream. Alfredson was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that [...] "I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell." [...] Lindqvist, in contrast, said that he had heard that Reeves [...] "will make a new film based on the book, and not remake the Swedish film" [...] and so [...] "it'll be <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different,</b> but it's going to be really interesting to see." [...] Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes referred to the project as a remake of the film and later not as a remake, but just as [...] "Reeves' version". Let Me In was released in late 2010 starring Chloë Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Abby and Owen, Eli's and Oskar's respective counterparts, and received very positive reviews but under-performed at the box office.|$|E

40|$|Re−imagining {{the city}} {{critically}} A re−designed {{city is a}} means to an end. And for Peter Marcuse, that end is the welfare and happiness of those whom the city should serve: all of us. Moreover, he shows how the realm of work could be shrunk significantly without impacting negatively on a desirable realm of freedom. Re−imagining the city can be a provocation to reconsider and expand the range of possibilities for a city in the future. It can simply be an opportunity for an unfettered imagination physically to design <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> new and <b>different,</b> not tethered to the existing city. Or it can open the door to a fundamentally critical view of the existing city, questioning the social and economic and organizational principles that underlie its present constitution and are normally taken for granted.
