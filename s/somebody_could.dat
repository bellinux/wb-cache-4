25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but <b>somebody</b> <b>could</b> maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{also wanted}} to create a film that sympathized with a crook. He explained, [...] "Frank was a 21st century genius working within the innocence of the mid '60s, when people were more trusting than they are now. I don't think {{this is the kind of}} movie where <b>somebody</b> <b>could</b> say, 'I have a career plan.|$|E
500|$|After the season, Hornish {{remained}} {{optimistic about}} an eventual IndyCar return: [...] "I hope they move the schedule so that <b>somebody</b> <b>could</b> do it. That's my goal. If I never {{ran in the}} Indy 500 again or an IndyCar Series race I would probably say I would be disappointed about that." [...] He received offers to return after his departure, and in late 2008 was rumored to be returning to replace Hélio Castroneves the next season due to Castroneves' IRS problems. Castroneves was eventually cleared, missing only the season opener with Will Power driving for Penske during his absence. In November 2013, Hornish declined an offer to drive for Chip Ganassi Racing in the upcoming season after Dario Franchitti's career-ending injuries at the 2013 Shell-Pennzoil Grand Prix of Houston.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea of a}} trust {{originated}} {{during the}} Crusades of the 12th century, when noblemen travelled abroad {{to fight in the}} Holy Land. As they would be away for years at a time it was vital that <b>somebody</b> <b>could</b> look after their land with the authority of the original owner. As a result, the idea of joint ownership of land arose. The common law courts did not recognise such trusts, and so it fell to equity and to the Court of Chancery to deal with them, as befitting the common principle that the Chancery's jurisdiction was for matters where the common law courts could neither enforce a right nor administer it. The use of trusts and uses became common during the 16th century, although the Statute of Uses [...] " [...] a severe blow to these forms of conveyancing" [...] and made the law in this area far more complex. The court's sole jurisdiction over trusts lasted until its dissolution.|$|E
500|$|Kelly died in Toronto, Canada, {{following}} an epileptic seizure, on April 12, 1971. He had traveled there from New York {{to play in}} a club with drummer George Reed and vocalist Herb Marshall. Kelly had a longstanding epilepsy problem, and had to monitor his condition carefully. An account of his death was given by his friend, Cobb: [...] "Wynton called his girlfriend in New York and said, 'You know, I don't feel good.' She said, 'Why don't you go downstairs to the bar and if something happens <b>somebody</b> <b>could</b> tend to you.' We don't know if he did that, because when they found him he was in the room." [...] Kelly was found in his room in the Westminster Hotel on Jarvis Street by Marshall. He was reported to have had almost no money {{at the time of his}} death. A memorial concert was held on June 28 in New York and featured numerous well-known musicians of the period.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} was negatively received by Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture and Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail. In May 2009, Deller placed Charlie at number five on her list of worst soap opera characters segment. Deller said, [...] "The Summer Bay cop may {{have lots of}} storylines, but the LC community don't really approve – mainly due to Esther Anderson's apparent lack of acting chops. It's like our hatred for Michelle Connor (Coronation Street) all over again, only this time with added scandalous-headline-grabbing-faux-lesbianity!" [...] In July 2009, Deller said, [...] "It {{would be easy to}} spend every month slagging off Charlie, because there's so much to dislike". Deller also added that Charlie's daughter is [...] "everything Charlie isn't". Stephen wondered if Charlie is going through an early menopause as she always appears [...] "to be in a sweat onscreen." [...] During a storyline, which saw Charlie decide she needs a counsellor to find her self-identity, Stephen complained that it was all she seemed to mention since her [...] "foray into lesbianism." [...] Stephen did, however, agree that Charlie needed a counsellor. She also stated she could help by telling her; [...] "Charlie: you're a mess." [...] Stephen was critical of Charlie's relationship with Angelo, which she described as a [...] "rocky road". She wanted to know how much the show could [...] "wring out of their on/off romance" [...] and asked if <b>somebody</b> <b>could</b> send them out to sea in a sinking boat. Following Charlie and Angelo's 2011 break up, Stephen stated that the show needs to [...] "change the record!" ...|$|E

500|$|On the October 31, 2007 {{episode of}} the reality show Phenomenon, Paranormalist Jim Callahan {{performed}} a summoning, purportedly of author Raymond Hill, to help discover {{the contents of a}} locked box. [...] Although fellow judge Uri Geller praised the performance, Angel called it [...] "comical" [...] and subsequently challenged both Callahan and Geller to guess the contents of two envelopes he pulled out of his pocket, offering a million dollars of his own money to whoever could do so. This led to an argument between Callahan and Angel, during which Callahan walked toward Angel and called him an [...] "ideological bigot", with the two pulled apart as the show promptly went to a commercial break. Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, [...] "Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a lot of years between us - 40 years, you were one year old when I came out with my spoon bending..." [...] Criss Angel cut him off at this point, saying, [...] "I guess this is a 'no,'" [...] and proceeded to open the envelope. The envelope contained an index card with the numbers [...] "911" [...] printed on it for September 11, 2001. Angel's explanation was this: [...] "If on 9-10 <b>somebody</b> <b>could</b> have predicted that 9-11 was going to happen, they could have saved thousands of lives". The other envelope's contents were scheduled to be revealed on the first episode of Season 4 of Criss Angel: Mindfreak.|$|E

5000|$|Lead singer Lauri Ylönen {{explained}} {{the title of}} the album on the band's website. [...] "Each song is a letter to <b>somebody.</b> It <b>could</b> be an apology, confession or cry out for help". The back side of the album booklet reads: ...|$|R

6000|$|Nobody, in short, {{could enter}} this room, except by passing through that of Mrs. Ricketts, {{the door of}} which [...] "was always made fast by a drawn bolt".

60|$|Somebody {{in there}} moaned with pain, and <b>somebody</b> else <b>could</b> be seen {{crouching}} over what seemed the prone {{body of a}} dead man; a lusty voice blasphemed; and the glow under each fire-door was like a pool of flaming blood radiating quietly in a velvety blackness.|$|R
60|$|The {{doctor had}} arrived at eight o'clock, cheery as ever, and had come downstairs after seeing Ruth {{to ask him to}} {{telephone}} to Mrs. Porter. In his overwrought state, this had jarred upon Kirk. Here, he felt, was <b>somebody</b> who <b>could</b> help where he was useless.|$|R

60|$|Nearer {{came the}} Wednesday of the party, and {{no hint of}} that event reached Somerset, but such as had been communicated by the Baptist minister. At last, on the very afternoon, an {{invitation}} was handed into his studio--not a kind note in Paula's handwriting, but a formal printed card in the joint names of Mrs. Goodman and Miss Power. It reached him just four hours before the dinner-time. He was plainly {{to be used as}} a stop-gap at the last moment because <b>somebody</b> <b>could</b> not come.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} another thing, Marian, and what makes it quite--at least very nearly out of the question; I don't believe they in the least {{reckoned}} on my hearing all this. You know the man is very good-natured; well, he took me up to go instead of his servant, and I was sitting back to back with them. I sometimes think my bad eyes have made my ears sharper, for I know I often hear when other people don't; and so I should not expect they supposed in the least that I was attending, though I did not miss a word, for I could not help hearing. Now, you see, I could not possibly go and betray him; {{and if you were}} not the safest person in the world, I would never have told you: only, if <b>somebody</b> <b>could</b> just give Caroline a hint that she is going to marry an infidel, it would be a pleasant thing." ...|$|E

A selection of seven finalists, including Van Cleave, was then flown to Belfast, Northern Ireland to audition before the show's producers. Headey also opted out of the casting process, but director David Nutter said finding the right double {{was one of the}} most important parts of making the finale. [...] "We needed <b>somebody</b> who <b>could</b> do The Walk of Shame physically, <b>somebody</b> who <b>could</b> match Lena's integrity, intensity, and sensibility. We found a tremendous actress in Rebecca; she was a godsend. The courage of this girl, who's never done anything like this in her life, who understood what was important about this...once I had her I felt like I could accomplish anything." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Spence, {{who looked}} after the school's efforts to win medals at Aldershot, {{was the most}} {{disappointed}} person in the place. He was an enthusiastic boxer--he had represented Cambridge in the Middle-Weights in his day--and with no small trouble had succeeded in making boxing a going concern at Wrykyn. Years of failure had ended, the Easter before, in a huge triumph, when O'Hara, of Dexter's and Drummond had won silver medals, and Moriarty, of Dexter's, a bronze. If only <b>somebody</b> <b>could</b> win a medal this year, the tradition would be established, and would not soon die out. Unfortunately, {{there was not a}} great deal of boxing talent in the school just now. The rule that the winner at his weight in the House Competitions should represent the school at Aldershot only applied if the winner were fairly proficient. Mr Spence exercised his discretion. It was no use sending down novices to be massacred. This year Drummond and Stanning were the only Wrykinians up to Aldershot form. Drummond would have been almost a certainty for a silver medal, and Stanning would probably have been a runner-up. And here they were, both injured; Wrykyn would not have a single representative at the Queen's Avenue Gymnasium. It would be a set-back to the cult of boxing at the school.|$|E
6000|$|... "The stillness was oppressive. I {{went back}} to my boat, made some coffee over a spirit-lamp, devoured a few biscuits, and {{stretched}} myself aft, to smoke and gaze at the stars. The earth was a mere shadow, formless and silent, and empty, till a bullock turned up from somewhere, quite shadowy too. He came smartly to {{the very edge of the}} bank as though he meant to step on board, stretched his muzzle right over my boat, blew heavily once, and walked off contemptuously into the darkness from which he had come. I had not expected a call from a bullock, though a moment's thought would have shown me that there must be lots of cattle and sheep on that marsh. Then everything became still as before. I might have imagined myself arrived on a desert island. In fact, as I reclined smoking a sense of absolute loneliness grew on me. And just as it had become intense, very abruptly and without any preliminary sound I heard firm, quick footsteps on the little wharf. Somebody coming along the cart-track had just stepped at a swinging gait on to the planks. That <b>somebody</b> <b>could</b> only have been Mr Powell. Suddenly he stopped short, having made out that there were two masts alongside the bank where he had left only one. Then he came on silent on the grass. When I spoke to him he was astonished.|$|E
60|$|This happy {{summer was}} succeeded by a {{singularly}} wet autumn. Weeks of continuous rain rendered it difficult {{even for the}} little Cadurcis, who defied the elements, to be so constant as heretofore in his daily visits to Cherbury. His mother, too, grew daily a greater invalid, and, with increasing sufferings and infirmities, the natural captiousness of her temper proportionally exhibited itself. She insisted upon the companionship of her son, {{and that he should}} not leave the house in such unseasonable weather. If he resisted, she fell into one of her jealous rages, and taunted him with loving strangers better than his own mother. Cadurcis, on the whole, behaved very well; he thought of Lady Annabel's injunctions, and restrained his passion. Yet he was not repaid for the sacrifice; his mother made no effort to render their joint society agreeable, or even endurable. She was rarely in an amiable mood, and generally either irritable or sullen. If the weather held up a little, and he ventured to pay a visit to Cherbury, he was sure to be welcomed back with a fit of passion; either Mrs. Cadurcis was angered for being left alone, or had fermented herself into fury by the certainty of his catching a fever. If Plantagenet remained at the abbey, she was generally sullen; and, as he himself was naturally silent under any circumstances, his mother would indulge in that charming monologue, so conducive to domestic serenity, termed 'talking at a person,' and was continually insinuating that she supposed he found it very dull to pass his day with her, and that she dared say that <b>somebody</b> <b>could</b> be lively enough if he were somewhere else.|$|E
