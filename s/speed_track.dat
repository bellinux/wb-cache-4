40|$|To {{overcome}} the drawbacks {{of using a}} traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control method for a robot driver system, such as requiring preliminary offline learning, big overshoot and large speed fluctuation, a new method for <b>speed</b> <b>tracking</b> of a robot driver system based on sliding mode control is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the coordinated control model of multiple manipulators for the robot driver is built, which achieved coordinated control of the throttle mechanical leg, clutch mechanical leg, brake mechanical leg and shift mechanical arm for the robot driver. On the basis of this, a <b>speed</b> <b>tracking</b> sliding mode controller for a vehicle robot driver is designed using the method of multiple sliding surfaces design, and the variable structure control laws of throttle and brake are designed respectively, which realize the <b>speed</b> <b>tracking</b> of the given driving test cycle. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with the PID control method, the proposed method can obviously reduce the overshoot of vehicle <b>speed</b> <b>tracking</b> control and greatly improve the accuracy of vehicle <b>speed</b> <b>tracking.</b> The vehicle <b>speed</b> <b>tracking</b> accuracy stays within a tolerance band of ± 2 km/h, which meets the requirements of national vehicle test standards. Furthermore, {{the action of the}} <b>speed</b> <b>tracking</b> control in the same driving test cycle using the proposed method is consistent, so that the robot driver has good repeatability. Therefore, it can ensure the effectiveness of the vehicle emission test...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper [3] Espinosa and Ortega {{presented}} an output feedback globally stable <b>speed</b> <b>tracking</b> controller for induction motors. An {{important feature of}} the scheme {{is that it does}} not require state observers, thus reducing the computational burden, a critical limiting factor in physical implementations. The performance of the scheme is limited by the fact that the convergence rate of the <b>speed</b> <b>tracking</b> errors is determined by the natural mechanical damping of the motor. In this brief note we overcome this drawback and show that by simple linear filtering of the <b>speed</b> <b>tracking</b> error we can inject mechanical damping to the closed loop. This allows us to improve the transient performance of the scheme in position and <b>speed</b> <b>tracking</b> applications without significantly increasing the computational requirements, while preserving the global stability properties. Further, it is shown that if the inverter can be modelled as a current source and the desired speed is constant, our passivityb [...] ...|$|R

[...] This is not done when the main track is available, as there is a speed disadvantage to having the train traverse the slower siding track (including having to stop to throw the switches to enter the siding).|$|E

40|$|Low cost un-modulated {{continuous}} wave (CW) radar (CW Doppler radar) {{can be used}} to measure the speed of a vehicle. Traditionally, a radar gun, a lidar gun or a speed camera is used to capture a speeding vehicle. A radar gun can either measure the fastest vehicle or the vehicle with the strongest reflection. If a radar gun is used, a police officer must determine which vehicle has the speed shown on the screen of the radar gun. A lidar gun can precisely detect a speeding vehicle, but it requires precise aiming. When a camera is used, a picture will be taken at a fixed location. For the first case, human error is unavoidable, for the second case, the aiming requirement makes it unsuitable for automated surveillance, and in the third case, the surveillance region is very limited. In order to solve these problems, we have invented an automatic traffic surveillance system (ATSS) using two CW Doppler radars (forward radar and side radar) and a video camera. An algorithm to balance in-phase and quadrature channel of directional CW Doppler radar based on spectrogram has been developed and tested on real highway data. A detailed architecture for Doppler <b>speed</b> <b>tracking</b> has been designed. Doppler <b>speed</b> <b>tracks</b> are initialized and extended by the side radar and further extended by the forward radar. Three algorithms have been developed for Doppler <b>speed</b> <b>tracking.</b> All algorithms have been tested on real highway data and simulated data.
