5|$|Food {{security}} and food power {{are not the}} same thing. However, they are often directly related. Food security is when all people of a region at all times have enough food for an active, healthy life. Food power is related when a government, company, leader, country etc. takes this security away in order to get <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>return.</b> Many countries employ the exploit of food power to threaten another country's food security. A country's welfare correlates directly with the welfare of its people therefore each country wants to have an appropriate supply of food for its citizens. This want, however, can easily be used as leverage in the politics of food, demonstrating food power.|$|E
25|$|When a team {{is willing}} to sign an {{upcoming}} free agent, but the player's current team wants <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>return,</b> it {{might be in the}} best interest of both clubs to execute a sign-and-trade deal. This occurs when one team signs one of its free agents and immediately trades that player to another team. A sign-and-trade is beneficial to both the player and the teams; the player receives a bigger contract than he might ordinarily get from a team that he would like to play for, while the trading club gets <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>return</b> for a free agent, and the recipient of the trade gets the player they desire. Sign-and-trades are a reality in the NBA because of the CBA's rules: unlike baseball, where teams losing free agents are compensated with draft picks or cash, NBA teams that lose free agents receive no compensation.|$|E
25|$|Mermaids- Stubborn, yet {{loyal and}} true to their word, mermaids have amazing voices that can hypnotize giants and humans. They {{are not easy}} to strike a deal with, as they {{frequently}} want <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>return</b> and usually take people as hostages to ensure the deal is kept. They {{seem to be able to}} do some magic as well, as they owned a cap able to make humans breathe underwater (similarly to the caps worn by merfolk in faery tales to walk on the shore).|$|E
6000|$|... "Who wouldn't sooner be {{the younger}} {{son of an}} earl than the eldest son of a plain squire?" [...] said Frank, wishing to say <b>something</b> civil <b>in</b> <b>return</b> for his cousin's civility.|$|R
50|$|The ECJ {{held that}} {{remuneration}} may be indirect “quid pro quo” rather than strict consideration for work i.e. work {{does not need}} to be paid for in money as long as the worker agrees to receive <b>something</b> else <b>in</b> <b>return.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "There is <b>something</b> <b>in</b> that," [...] <b>returned</b> Hake; [...] "but will it {{not suffice}} to {{exercise}} a little caution and self-restraint, without giving our countryman the cold shoulder?" ...|$|R
25|$|In May 1940, the US {{requested}} base {{rights in}} Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>return.</b> In September 1940, {{as part of}} the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was {{for the duration of the}} war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from Darrell's Island in 1943).|$|E
25|$|Until {{their first}} act of sexual intercourse, {{adolescents}} generally see virginity {{in one of}} the following ways: as a gift, a stigma, or a normal step in development. Girls typically think of virginity as a gift, while boys think of virginity as a stigma. In interviews, girls said that they viewed giving someone their virginity as like giving them a very special gift. Because of this, they often expected <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>return</b> such as increased emotional intimacy with their partners or the virginity of their partner. However, they often felt disempowered because of this; they often did not feel like they actually received what they expected in return and this made them feel like they had less power in their relationship. They felt that they had given something up and did not feel like this action was recognized.|$|E
500|$|Rhys becomes {{determined}} {{to join the}} hospital surgical program led {{by the head of}} surgery, Martin Chambers (John Wood). When Karl makes a potentially dangerous mistake on a prescription form, Rhys covers for him, but makes it clear he wants <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>return.</b> Knowing Karl plays golf with Martin, Rhys asks to join their game so he can try and impress the surgeon. Despite being warned that Martin does not like to talk shop during his golf games, Rhys reveals that he has been following his career and Martin is impressed. Barber explained to a writer for Inside Soap [...] "And Karl {{has no choice but to}} agree that Rhys is a good doctor. It's a bit awkward, because Karl doesn't like the way Rhys operates— so to speak!" [...] Martin grants Rhys an interview for a place on the surgical program; however he forgets everything he knows and makes a fool of himself due to being hungover. Rhys misses out on a place on the program and Barber told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that he is feeling [...] "devastated and desperate." [...] Barber described the position as the Holy Grail for Rhys and because of a stupid act, he has lost it.|$|E
50|$|Kitty Brent {{helps him}} with some {{steamship}} tickets, so Tom {{wants to do}} <b>something</b> nice <b>in</b> <b>return.</b> Kitty says her marriage to fiance Kenneth is on hold until he can sell an insurance policy to a milkman named Baglipp. An overly optimistic Tom assures her she'll be married by the next morning. His schemes to make Baglipp take the policy ends up getting Tom and Kitty into all kinds of trouble, including involvement with a robbery.|$|R
40|$|Reciprocity is {{important}} for culture and therefore for human beings. Culture depends on reciprocity: if I do something for you, you should do <b>something</b> for me <b>in</b> <b>return.</b> Reciprocity is also important in liking. Having someone like you is powerful at a deep, gut level: {{it is hard to}} resist liking that person <b>in</b> <b>return...</b>|$|R

"This putteth Faith <b>something</b> <b>in</b> arrears," [...] <b>returned</b> he who {{has been}} called Ensign, and who was no other than the reader's old {{acquaintance}} Eben Dudley, preferred to that station in the train-band of the valley. [...] "The heart of my brother Reuben will be gladdened by these tidings, when he shall return from the scout." ...|$|R
2500|$|According {{to local}} tradition, Gwalior owes {{its name to}} a sage of former times. Suraj Sen, a prince of the gurjar-pratihar clan of the eighth century, {{is said to have}} lost his way in the forest. On a secluded hill, he met an old man, the sage Gwalipa, whose {{influence}} almost took him by surprise. Upon asking the sage for some drinking water, he was led to a pond, where the waters not only quenched his thirst but cured him of leprosy. Out of gratitude, the prince wished to offer the sage <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>return,</b> and the sage asked him to build a wall on the hill to protect the other sages from wild animals which often disturbed their yajnas (or pujas). Suraj Sen later built a palace inside the fort, which was named [...] "Gwalior" [...] after the sage, and eventually the city that grew around the fort took the same name.|$|E

5000|$|The Church of Scientology, {{founded by}} L. Ron Hubbard, teaches that an immortal spiritual being exists inside everyone. The Church uses the [...] "auditing" [...] {{practice}} to help interested people {{become aware of}} this spiritual being. The Church uses the [...] "training" [...] courses to help participants to become auditors. The Church charges for those services due to the belief that, any time a person receives something, that person must pay <b>something</b> back <b>in</b> <b>return.</b> [...] The income generated by those services constitutes the Church's primary source of income.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{other forms}} of online {{marketing}}, content marketing relies on anticipating and meeting an existing customer need for information, as opposed to creating demand for a new need. As James O'Brien of Contently wrote on Mashable, [...] "The idea central to content marketing is that a brand must give something valuable to get <b>something</b> valuable <b>in</b> <b>return.</b> Instead of the commercial, be the show. Instead of the banner ad, be the feature story." [...] For content marketing, continuous delivery of large amounts of content is required, preferably within a content marketing strategy.|$|R

You've had {{everything}} done for you, and if you don't do <b>something</b> for me <b>in</b> <b>return,</b> by G----, you shall have a hard time of it. If you weren't such a fool you'd believe me when I say that I know more than you do.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{will know}} before tomorrow. In the {{meantime}} try {{and think it}} out for yourself. A successful and prosperous detective agency like yours, Mr. Snyder, ought to do <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>return</b> for a fee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, the cost," [...] she said, {{with what}} was {{obviously}} enforced calm. [...] "Lydie d'Aumont did not give you that promise for nothing; you gave her or promised her <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>return.</b> What was it?" ...|$|E
25|$|A second {{explanation}} {{issued by}} Janssen and Vanhamme {{is that of}} reciprocal altruism. This is a key concept in evolutionary psychology that is argued to fuel all human behaviour: people only do something {{if they can get}} <b>something</b> back <b>in</b> <b>return.</b> <b>In</b> the case of CSR and ethical consumerism, however, consumers get very little <b>in</b> <b>return</b> for their investment. Ethically sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However, the reward for consumers is not much different from that of a non-ethical counterpart. Therefore, evolutionary speaking making an ethical purchase is not worth the higher cost to the individual even if they believe in supporting ethically, environmentally and socially beneficial causes.|$|R
5000|$|Richard: When Anita {{loses her}} tie to Jean-Claude, Richard comes to North Carolina {{to try to}} help. Unfortunately, after seeing that Anita has added to her list of lovers, Richard is not pleased. He {{releases}} the anger that he gained from her when Jean-Claude connected them in the triumvirate and Anita realizes she can either fight it or embrace it. By {{the end of the}} book, Richard is acting and feeling more like he did when he first met Anita. However, by potentially taking away the anger, Anita may have given him <b>something</b> else <b>in</b> <b>return.</b>|$|R

60|$|He {{raised his}} head quickly, and looking towards the girl with a brightened face, nodded to her, and said 'Yes,' Florence looked towards her too, {{and gave her a}} kind salutation; the girl muttered <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>return,</b> ungraciously and sullenly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, supposing {{you let me}} {{look into}} this matter with you? I am {{in no hurry to}} get away from these parts, and I feel that you ought to let me do <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>return</b> for what you and Chet did for me." ...|$|E
60|$|Sylvia sat {{silent for}} a few moments, because she understood. If Herbert granted the favor, he would look for <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>return,</b> though {{she had no idea}} what this would be.

6000|$|... "You {{would be}} more ready than I am. One cannot but answer her because she expects to hear <b>something</b> said <b>in</b> <b>return.</b> I shall keep {{out of her way}} as much as possible. I shall have my breakfast brought to me in my own room to-morrow, and shall then remain with my father as much as possible. If I leave him at all I shall get a walk. There will only be the dinner. As to one thing I have quite made up my mind. Nothing shall drive me into having any words with Mr. Greenwood;--unless, indeed, my father were to ask me to speak to him." ...|$|R
60|$|Around {{this young}} {{creature}} were clustered {{no less than}} five young men, dressed in {{the height of the}} fashion, all of whom seemed to be entranced with the words that fell from her lips, and each of whom appeared anxious to say <b>something</b> clever <b>in</b> <b>return.</b> They all laughed, the lady most, and sometimes all spoke at once. Notwithstanding these outbreakings, Miss Ring did most of the talking, and once or twice, as a young man would gape after a most exhilarating show of merriment, and discover an inclination to retreat, she managed to recall him to his allegiance, by some remark particularly pertinent to himself, or his feelings.|$|R
40|$|This {{recording}} {{opens with}} singing followed by Dell giving a prayer to the hardworking man. He {{talks about the}} migration of the Israelites camping by the Red Sea, and how God told them to move forward.

60|$|Winston, who {{was usually}} correct in his deductions, surmised that his {{companion}} had an object, and expected <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>return</b> for this confidence.

5000|$|Afterwards, Babe is {{surprised}} when Connie {{is willing to}} stay with him, even knowing what he does for a living. He decides to take a trip to South America with Vane and Vargas, but without her. At the last minute, he realizes that he loves her, so he does not board the ship. Instead, he tells Collins to charge him with <b>something,</b> and, <b>in</b> <b>return</b> for a confession, he will serve 90 days in jail {{to pay for his}} past misdeeds and [...] "come clean". However, in order to keep Connie from discovering that he is in jail, he gets Vargas to send weekly cablegrams in his name to her from South America.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 December 2008, Feyenoord {{announced}} not {{to renew}} the partnership contract with Excelsior due to financial and flexibility reasons. However, only five months later, Feyenoord and Excelsior agreed on an even more extensive partnership. As {{part of the new}} agreement, the clubs started a joint regional youth academy called Feyenoord Academy and merged the club's reserve teams. Also, Excelsior continued to be Feyenoord's feeder club. Excelsior's managing director Simon Kelder was pleased with the new extensive partnership: [...] "I already regretted the earlier withdrawal of cooperation from Feyenoord, but now we get <b>something</b> better <b>in</b> <b>return.</b> It doesn't only reduces the costs, but I am also convinced both clubs will benefit on sportive grounds." ...|$|R
