5|$|Students {{living on}} campus occupy a {{dormitory}} {{referred to as}} the , although its correct name is Astraea Dormitory, named after Astraea Hill. The building is a triangular shape, allowing for the segregation of students from the three schools; each section is about the same size. It was built about 100years before the story begins, around the same time that Miator was established, for <b>students</b> <b>whose</b> homes are far away. Each student is assigned a roommate in their year until graduation. If there is an odd number of students enrolled in a given year, one of the new students must live alone until a student in their year transfers into their school.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Baxter {{heard that}} the New South Wales University of Technology {{was looking for a}} {{professor}} of chemical engineering. He applied, and was offered the job. Baxter and his family packed their belongings and sailed to Australia on the ocean liner Orcades, arriving in Sydney on 16 January 1950. They bought a house in Enfield, where Baxter would reside {{for the rest of his}} life. At the time the university was located in temporary accommodation on the grounds of the Sydney Technical College campus in Ultimo. Baxter became the head of a new School of Chemical Engineering that was created on his arrival, but he initially had only one full-time staff member as most of the instruction was carried out by part-time staff. Although he had no previous teaching experience, he turned out to be a good, well-organised lecturer, and he worked closely with his first postgraduate <b>students,</b> <b>whose</b> research was into fields that Baxter had been involved with in England.|$|E

5|$|The USAD {{requires}} {{a diversity of}} achievement within each team; teams must have students who fall into three categories determined by GPA. The Honors category is composed of students with GPAs between 3.75 and 4.0. The Scholastic category consists of students with GPAs between 3.0 and 3.74. The final group, the Varsity category, contains <b>students</b> <b>whose</b> GPA ranges from 0.00 to 2.99. USAD uses a modified GPA scale in which performance-based classes such as music, art or physical education are omitted from the GPA calculation. A grade counts for face value {{regardless of whether it}} is from an advanced placement, honors, regular or remedial class. An A is counted as a 4.0, a B as a 3.0, a C as a 2.0, a D as a 1.0, and a F as a 0. Only final grades taken from the previous two complete school years are used to calculate GPA.|$|E

25|$|The {{demand for}} {{restoration}} of religious education {{in public schools}} {{began in the late}} 1940s. The government initially responded by authorizing religious instruction in state schools for those <b>students</b> <b>whose</b> parents requested it.

Religious education was made compulsory for all primary and secondary school children in 1982.|$|E
