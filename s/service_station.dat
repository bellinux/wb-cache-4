5|$|Unusually for a {{motorway}} <b>service</b> <b>station,</b> the {{two sites}} are {{about half a}} mile apart due to the proximity of junction 8 (for the M50 motorway). The services opened with the motorway in 1962 and have undergone many developments over time, largely due to the evolution of the motorway, which {{at the time of its}} opening ran from Birmingham to Strensham but now runs to Exeter some 100 miles southwards. It was the first <b>service</b> <b>station</b> on the M5.|$|E

5|$|In Liverpool, at 8:30 am on 17 May, Saturday, {{the twins}} went into St Anne Street Police Station to report {{concerns}} over Sabina's children. At midday the pair boarded a National Express coach to London. A police report {{stated that the}} twins suddenly disembarked from the coach at Keele services, a motorway <b>service</b> <b>station,</b> as they were not feeling well. The driver of the coach, however, said he left them at Keele services after becoming suspicious of their behaviour. He noticed the twins clinging tightly to their bags and did not let them re-board because they refused to let him search their bags for illegal items. The manager of the <b>service</b> <b>station</b> was informed and, also feeling suspicious of the pair, called the police. Officers arrived {{to talk to them}} but left after deeming the women harmless.|$|E

However, {{this was the case}} only with certain Caltex <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> close to Woolworths supermarkets and many remain unassociated with the fuel discount offer.|$|R

Chimneys fell (especially on older {{homes in the}} {{downtown}} area of Gilroy) and glass was broken, but in Gilroy structural damage afflicted five buildings.

50|$|The road carries heavy traffic, {{so there}} are a lot of <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> along its length. But until 2004, the Junín - Villa Mercedes section did not have any <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> selling {{compressed}} natural gas (CNG), so vehicles that relied on this fuel diverted along National Route 8 instead.|$|R
5|$|On February 22, 1947, Crisp {{was hired}} to serve as line coach at Tulane under head coach Henry Frnka. At {{the time of the}} announcement, Crisp {{indicated}} he would maintain his permanent residence and family <b>service</b> <b>station</b> in Tuscaloosa and report to New Orleans for spring practices and the regular season in the fall.

5|$|The Patterson Post Office {{underwent}} several re-locations {{throughout the}} years. After the Lloyd Lumber Company {{moved to a}} larger building along NY311, the post office occupied the smaller structure; both were situated {{on the east side}} of the New York Central tracks. Residents complained that the new location was inadequate, claiming that parking was insufficient at nearby companies, and that walking along a busy road to reach the post office was dangerous. After a bidding process to determine the future location, the office was again moved to a former car <b>service</b> <b>station</b> along Front Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{radio station}} played {{a vital role}} during the Second World War in {{maintaining}} communications with the British merchant navy and with patrol aircraft in the North Atlantic. During the war, all communications with ships were one-way {{in order to avoid}} revealing the ships' locations to the enemy. The station was short-staffed because many were on secondments to various government services, such as operating other radio stations and training new radio officers to work in naval convoys. In 1943, the workload was so great that a Royal Navy officer and 18 telegraphists were brought in from HMS Flowerdown, a Naval Shore Wireless <b>Service</b> <b>station</b> near Winchester.|$|E
40|$|The {{location}} {{planning of}} emergency <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> is crucial, {{especially in the}} populated cities with heavy tra±c conditions such as Istanbul. In this paper, we propose a Backup Double Covering Model (BDCM), {{a variant of the}} well-known Maximal Covering Location Problem, that requires two types of services to plan the emergency <b>service</b> <b>stations.</b> The objective of the model is to maximize the total population serviced using two distinct emergency <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> in di®erent time limits where the total number of stations is limited. We propose a Tabu Search (TS) approach to solve the problem. We conduct an extensive experimental study on randomly generated data set with di®erent parameters to demonstrate the e®ectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we apply our TS approach for planning the emergency <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> in Istanbul...|$|R

5|$|The twins {{had been}} in Ireland before {{travelling}} to England and boarding a coach for London at Liverpool. Their odd behaviour after exiting the coach at a <b>service</b> <b>station</b> on the M6 – including not allowing the bags they were clutching to be searched – caused the driver not to allow them back on the coach. The two were later seen on the central reservation of the M6. When Highways Agency Traffic Officers arrived to assist the women, they ran across the busy motorway. Ursula managed to dodge traffic; Sabina was first struck by a SEAT León.|$|E
5|$|After {{playing in}} the 60 games, Tipton was {{suspended}} after an argument with Chickasaws manager Jack Cassini, and after the season ended {{he retired from the}} game to work at his <b>service</b> <b>station.</b> He returned to baseball in 1957 and spent a season with the Birmingham Barons, and partway through the 1958 season, he joined the Panama City Fliers as manager. He was fired a month later, and in protest the Fliers refused to play their next game. Tipton retired afterwards, and a year later was banned for life from the minor leagues after it came to light that he accepted payouts by acting as a liaison for Jesse Levan, who was intentionally fouling off balls in order for gamblers in the stands to take advantage of them.|$|E
5|$|At about 5 a.m., Parsons {{stopped at}} a Texaco <b>service</b> <b>station</b> 23 miles to the north. He was wearing Ernest's clothes and had assumed his identity. Parsons told the station {{attendant}} he needed to hose out red construction paint from the car's interior and offered to give him Ernest's construction tools. The attendant said that he observed Parsons throwing away clothing, books, posters and carpentry tools into a dumpster. Parsons asked the attendant about the distance to Denver and spoke of Ernest's 9-year-old son as his own. He purchased cigarettes and food with Ernest's MasterCard credit card before leaving. At 7:23 a.m., Parsons used the credit card to check into a Quality Inn at Richfield, Utah. He used the card again at about 10 a.m. to purchase seat covers and floor mats from Kmart {{to cover up the}} blood stains in the car. A clerk called the Richfield Police Department after Parsons attempted to purchase $300 worth of items at 12:34 p.m. and the credit card was found to be over its limit. The attendant back at the Texaco station called the Beaver County Sheriff's Office after discovering bloody items in the dumpster. Deputy Raymond Goodwin found Ernest's bank statement and Parsons' bloody clothes in the dumpster. After calling Ernest's wife Beverley, the officers concluded that the person who visited the <b>service</b> <b>station</b> was not Richard Ernest. At about 4:25 p.m. on August 31, a Utah Highway Patrol officer found Parsons sleeping in Ernest's car at the Red Creek rest area on Interstate 70, west of Salina, Utah. When Parsons was brought into the Richfield police station where the bloody clothes were gathered, he continued to insist that he was Ernest. When officers asked for his street address, Parsons asked for a lawyer. Sheriff Kenneth Yardley recalled that Parsons asked if he could keep his book to read.|$|E
