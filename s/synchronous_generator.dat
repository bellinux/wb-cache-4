40|$|Voltage {{stability}} {{in general is}} of paramount importance with increasing penetration levels of variable-speed wind power generators (VSWGs) in power systems. Limited knowledge exists considering the impact of VSWGs on long-term voltage stability (LTVS) of power systems, focusing on doubly fed induction generators and full-converter wind generators. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive study on the impact of VSWGs on LTVS. Integration of wind generators while operating the existing <b>synchronous</b> <b>generators</b> improves the LTVS. However, it is unlikely that power systems will retain all existing <b>synchronous</b> <b>generators</b> operating, with high wind penetration levels. Therefore, this study compares the capability of the <b>synchronous</b> <b>generators</b> and VSWGs on LTVS by considering the dynamic reactive power capabilities. The significance of overload capability of <b>synchronous</b> <b>generators</b> on LTVS is highlighted. It is also illustrated that integrating wind farms at remote and local locations from load centres has distinct impacts on LTVS. Replacement of <b>synchronous</b> <b>generators</b> located in close proximity to load centres has a detrimental effect on LTVS. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the impact of different wind generator loading levels on LTVS. The study outcomes highlight several distinct factors which influence the LTVS of power systems with high wind penetration levels...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} addresses some of {{the difficulties}} faced when operating voltage controlled inverters with <b>synchronous</b> <b>generators</b> in microgrids. First, an overview of microgrid value propositions is provided, and the problems faced when attempting to use microgrids to provide improved power quality are discussed. Design considerations for different types of microgrids are provided to enable microgrids to deliver the desired functionality without adding unnecessary cost. The main body of this research investigates the poor transient load sharing encountered between voltage controlled inverters and <b>synchronous</b> <b>generators</b> in islanded operation. Poor transient load sharing results in high peak inverter rating requirements and high cost. The tradeoff between power quality and power sharing is highlighted, and methods to improve transient load sharing are proposed. The use of current limiting to protect inverters during faults and overloads is also investigated. Stability problems are identified when using simple inverter current limiting methods when operating in parallel with <b>synchronous</b> <b>generators.</b> Virtual impedance current limiting is proposed to improve transient stability during current limiting. The methods proposed in this thesis for mitigating inverter overloads and faults will allow for more reliable and cost effective application of inverter based distributed energy resources with <b>synchronous</b> <b>generators</b> in microgrids.

40|$|Because of the {{increasing}} share of distributed generation (DG) units, a coordinated approach for their integration in the electrical network is required. Therefore, the microgrid concept has been introduced. Most DG units use power-electronic interfaces, i. e. converters, for which control strategies have been developed such that these units can participate in the microgrid control. Because of the specific characteristics of low-voltage islanded microgrids, such as their resistive nature and lack of inertia, P/V and Q/f droops are often applied for the converter control. However, still some directly-coupled <b>synchronous</b> <b>generators</b> can {{be present in the}} microgrid. These generators have different characteristics compared to the converter-based DG units, such as the presence of rotating inertia. Also, their control is mostly based on P/f and $Q$/$V$ droops. To integrate both <b>synchronous</b> <b>generators</b> and converter-based DG units in an islanded microgrid, their control strategies should be adjusted to each other. As the DG units form the major part of the generators in the islanded microgrid, in this paper, the control of the <b>synchronous</b> <b>generators</b> is changed to introduce converter behavior. The <b>synchronous</b> <b>generators</b> are equipped with P/V and Q/f droop controllers that are adjusted to take the rotating inertia into account.
