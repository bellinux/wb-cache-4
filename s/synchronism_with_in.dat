50|$|After the Middle Assyrian Kingdom {{there is}} an {{uncertain}} period in Assyrian history. The current cornerstone of chronology for this time is the Assyrian King List which, unfortunately, conflicts with other records such as the Synchronised King List and the Babylonian King List. In any event, the rulers of Assyria in this time were all fairly weak, except for Tiglath-Pileser I. Note too that this chronology is based on assumed <b>synchronisms</b> <b>with</b> Egypt <b>in</b> the previous period.|$|R

40|$|The permanent-magnet ac (PMAC) motor {{requires}} accurate {{position information}} to be supplied to the controller so that the applied currents can be modulated <b>in</b> <b>synchronism</b> <b>with</b> the rotor. <b>In</b> the flux-weakening region of operation, accurate rotor position information is critical to control the relative phase of the applied stator voltages. The design of controllers, which can operate without direct position feedback, {{have been the subject}} of intense development. The most commonly cited justifications for the elimination of the absolute position encoder are those of cost, and the reduction of the overall dimensions of the motor. However, certain military specifications apply stringent constraints to the use of both sensors and estimation techniques. Absolute encoders are frequently prohibited for applications such as tank turret drives due to their relatively fragile nature. Fully sensorless operation has been the focus of development for all classes of electric motors, but again is precluded not only in certain military applications, but also in traction applications for a number of manufacturers...|$|R

40|$|Chloride flux, a {{surrogate}} for heat flow, was determined for the four rivers draining Yellowstone National Park (the Park) for the water years (October 1 through September 30) 1983 through 2003, {{with the exception of}} 1995 and 1996. The chloride emitted by the geothermal system underlying Yellowstone Park is designated “thermal chloride,” and it constitutes 94 percent of the total chloride exiting the Park. The remainder of the chloride is contributed by rainfall, rock weathering, and a minor amount due to human impact. Of this 94 percent, the Fall, Madison, Snake, and Yellowstone Rivers have been determined to discharge 93 percent of the chloride leaving the Park; the remaining 7 percent exits along the west boundary into the Henrys Fork River. The chloride flux for each river varied seasonally and annually, and we postulate that it depended primarily on the flow of hot springs. This flow, in turn, depended on the height of the local water table, which increased during spring runoff and varied annually <b>in</b> <b>synchronism</b> <b>with</b> changes <b>in</b> precipitation. The sum of the annual chloride fluxes for the four rivers varies as much as 20 percent year-to-year. This sum, when corrected for the climatic factors, shows a decline of 10 percent during the past 20 years. A lengthening in the period between eruptions of Old Faithful Geyser has also been observed. We believe that these changes may be related to deflation of the Yellowstone caldera documented by changes in ground levels surrounding Yellowstone Lake...|$|R

40|$|Several cores {{recovered}} from the northern belt of the Southern Ocean were analysed to study the Pleistocene calcareous nannofossil records. Calcareous nannofossil events previously described in medium and low latitudes were identified and calibrated with the oxygen isotope and geomagnetic time scales. Although sedimentation rates, hiatuses and degree of calcareous nannofossil preservation sometimes prevent the identification and/or accurate calibration {{of some of these}} events, a useful stratigraphic framework was obtained. The possibility of using these calibrated events from high to low latitudes facilitates correlations and should facilitate isotope event identification <b>in</b> a region <b>with</b> low temperature, where calcareous plankton stratigraphies are in general restricted. In general, Pleistocene southern high latitude calcareous nannofossil events show <b>synchronism</b> <b>with</b> those observed <b>in</b> warm and temperate surficial waters. Small discrepancies in the assigned ages are sometimes related to low sampling resolution due to low sedimentation rates. The first occurrence (FO) of Emiliania huxleyi and the last occurrence (LO) of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa are observed in Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 8 and 12, respectively. A reversal in abundance between Gephyrocapsa muellerae and E. huxleyi is observed close to the MIS 4 / 5 boundary. MIS 6 is characterised by an increase in G. muellerae and MIS 7 features a dramatic decrease in the proportion of Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica. This latter species began to increase its proportions from the MIS 13 / 14 boundary to MIS 13, showing diachronism between the different sites. The LO of Reticulofenestra asanoi is observed at MIS 22, confirming this event as a global synchronous reference datum. By contrast, the FO of R. asanoi occurs at MIS 35 and is diachronous with the existing data from other oceanic regions. A re-entry of medium sized Gephyrocapsa (3 - 5 mm maximum diameters) can be identified in some cores close to MIS 25; although the low abundance of this taxon prevents an accurate calibration, it may be concluded that this event is diachronous as compared with the existing low-latitude data. The LO of large morphotypes of Gephyrocapsa is well correlated with MIS 37, showing <b>synchronism</b> <b>with</b> other oceanic regions, whereas the FO of this species is not well calibrated due to the absence of age-control points...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The magnicon [1, 2] is a {{scanning}} [...] beam {{microwave amplifier}} that is under consideration {{as an alternative}} to klystrons in powering future high [...] gradient linear electron accelerators. Scanning [...] beam amplifiers modulate the insertion point of the electron beam into the output cavity <b>in</b> <b>synchronism</b> <b>with</b> the phase of a rotating rf wave. This synchronism creates the potential for an extremely efficient interaction in the output cavity, since every electron will in principle experience identical decelerating rf fields. In the magnicon, the output interaction is gyrotron [...] like, and requires a beam with substantial transverse momentum. The transverse momentum is produced by spinning up the electron beam in a sequence of TM 110 deflection cavities, the first driven by an external rf source. The output cavity employs an rf mode that rotates <b>in</b> <b>synchronism</b> <b>with</b> the deflection cavity modes. As a result, the beam entering the output cavity is fully phase modu...|$|R
