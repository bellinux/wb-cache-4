40|$|<b>Skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>testing</b> {{is widely}} used to predict the {{presence}} of allergen-specific IgE. In eosinophilic esophagitis patients, who frequently exhibit polysensitization and broad reactivity upon <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>testing,</b> this is commonly used to aid avoidance recommendations in the clinical management of their disease. We present here the predictive value of <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>testing</b> {{for the presence of}} allergen-specific IgE, in 12 patients, determined by immunoblot against the allergen extracts using individual-matched serum. Our results demonstrate a high degree of predictive value for aeroallergens but a poor predictive value for food allergens. This suggests that <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>testing</b> likely identifies IgE reactivity towards aeroallergens in adult eosinophilic esophagitis but this is not true for foods. Consequently, IgE immunoblotting might be required for determining food avoidance in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the importance of atopy patch testing with aeroallergens as a diagnostic method in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis. Method: The complet dermatological and allergological examinations were performed in 29 patients; 10 men, 19 women with {{the average age of}} 27. 8 years, min. 17, max. 57 years; with the median SCORAD 24. 2 points, s. d. 13. 3 points. Wormwood, grass, dog dander, cat dander, dermatophagoides pharinae, dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and birch pollen were examined in diagnostic procedures. <b>Skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>tests,</b> specific IgE were examined; the atopy patch tests were performed with aeroallergens for <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>tests</b> in concentration 1 × <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>tests.</b> Results: Specific IgE and <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>tests</b> to one or more tested aeroallergens were positive altogether in 27 patients; atopy patch tests were positive only in one of these patients. Conclusion: For atopy patch testing with aeroallergens the concentration of 1 × <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>tests</b> is low to confirme the eczematic reaction in patients suffering from allergy to inhallant allergens...|$|R

25|$|Effective {{management}} of allergic diseases {{relies on the}} ability to make an accurate diagnosis. Allergy testing can help confirm or rule out allergies. Correct diagnosis, counseling, and avoidance advice based on valid allergy test results reduces the incidence of symptoms and need for medications, and improves quality of life. To assess the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, two different methods can be used: a <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>test,</b> or an allergy blood test. Both methods are recommended, and they have similar diagnostic value.|$|E
25|$|Common foods {{involved}} include cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy, wheat, rice, and fruit. The common allergies {{vary depending}} on the country. Risk factors include a family history of allergies, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, and high levels of cleanliness. Allergies occur when immunoglobulin E (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binds to food molecules. A protein in the food is usually the problem. This triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history, elimination diet, <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>test,</b> blood tests for food-specific IgE antibodies, or oral food challenge.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis is {{generally}} made {{through a combination}} of <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>testing</b> or blood testing and detailed records of all foods and drink the person regularly ingests.|$|R

2500|$|If {{the patient}} is {{allergic}} to the substance, then a visible inflammatory reaction will usually occur within 30minutes. This response will range from slight reddening of the skin to a full-blown hive (called [...] "wheal and flare") in more sensitive patients similar to a mosquito bite. Interpretation {{of the results of}} the <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>test</b> is normally done by allergists on a scale of severity, with +/− meaning borderline reactivity, and 4+ being a large reaction. Increasingly, allergists are measuring and recording the diameter of the wheal and flare reaction. Interpretation by well-trained allergists is often guided by relevant literature. Some patients may believe they have determined their own allergic sensitivity from observation, but a skin test has been shown to be much better than patient observation to detect allergy.|$|E

40|$|Background: Diagnosis of {{food allergy}} is {{difficult}} in children. Food allergies are diagnosed using several methods that include medical histories, clinical examinations, <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> and serum-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) tests, radio-allergosorbent test (RAST), food challenge, and supervised elimination diets. In {{this study we}} evaluated allergies to cow's milk, egg, peanut, and fish in children with suspected food allergies with <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>tests</b> and serum and feces RAST.

50|$|Skin prick {{tests can}} be used to confirm {{specific}} food allergies. Skin prick tests are designed to identify specific IgE bound to cutaneous mast cells. During the test, a glycerinated allergen extract drop is placed on the patient's skin. The patient's skin is then pricked through the drop. This procedure is repeated with two controls: a histamine drop designed to elicit an allergic response, and a saline drop designed to elicit no allergic response. The wheal that develops from the glycerinated extract drop is compared against the saline control. A positive allergic test is one in which the extract wheal is 3mm larger than the saline wheal. A positive <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>test</b> is about 50% accurate, so a positive <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>test</b> alone is not diagnostic of food allergies.|$|E

40|$|Mould allergy {{revealed}} by <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>tests</b> or by measuring specific IgE (RAST), is frequently diagnosed throughout the world. It is associated to clinical asthma, sometimes severe. Thanks to the know how of teams of specialists, surveys {{are carried out}} in home-, work- and school environments, and calendars of moulds found in our country are regularly updated. This allows practitioners to determine specific sensitisation <b>tests</b> (selection of <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>tests,</b> and RAS tests), and helps them {{play a role in}} the diagnosis strategy and the recommendations for necessary eviction and building sanitation measures.

50|$|A <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>test</b> {{is usually}} {{performed}} on the inner forearm where a grid is marked and a drop of the allergens to be tested are placed on the arm in the grid. Once this has been done, the skin is pricked through the drop using a lancet. Reactions, if any, occur within 10 to 15 minutes and these results can then be analyzed.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{important}} to note that, while a positive pathergy reaction helps to confirm a specific Behçet's disease diagnosis, a negative reaction does not invalidate a BD diagnosis, because the disease process has to be active {{at the time of the}} <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>test</b> to produce a pathergy reaction. Differences in positive/negative pathergy and severity of the reaction depend on disease activity, ethnicity, type of needle used for the prick test, among other factors.|$|E

40|$|Background: It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that in patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma, avoidance of specific triggers can help improve symptom control and reduce need for medication. Whilst most patients with asthma or rhinitis are sensitized to airborne allergens, primary care diagnostic and management decisions are often made without either obtaining a detailed history of the patient's allergic triggers or performing <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>tests.</b> Thus, management decisions are empirical and allergen avoidance advice is either not given or, if given, not tailored to the patient's sensitivities. Method: To ascertain whether allergy assessment and tailored advice in general practice for patients with asthma and rhinitis enhance well-being, we conducted a pragmatic, open, randomized controlled trial of allergy intervention (structured allergy history and <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>testing</b> and appropriate advice on allergy avoidance) versus usual care in adult patients with a working diagnosis of asthma and/or rhino-conjunctivitis. Outcomes were assessed after 12 months by an observer who was blinded to allocation. The main outcome measures were asthma and rhinitis symptoms, disease-specific health-related quality of life, generic {{quality of life and}} lung function. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} baseline demographics or disease characteristics between patients assigned to immediate or delayed <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>testing.</b> No significant differences were observed between groups for any measures of symptoms, quality of life or lung function at 12 months (all P > 0. 05). Conclusion: Amongst adults with known asthma and/or rhinitis in primary care, taking a structured allergy history with <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>tests</b> and giving tailored advice on allergy avoidance made no difference to their symptoms, quality of life or lung function as measured twelve months later...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} dust exposure, {{respiratory}} symptoms, lung function, {{and response to}} <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>tests</b> was conducted in a modern British bakery. Of the 318 bakery employees, 279 (88 %) took part. Jobs were ranked from 0 to 10 by perceived dustiness and this ranking correlated well with total dust concentration measured in 79 personal dust samples. Nine samples had concentrations greater than 10 mg/m 3, the exposure limit for nuisance dust. All participants completed a self administered questionnaire on symptoms and their relation to work. FEV 1 and FVC were measured by a dry wedge spirometer and bronchial reactivity to methacholine was estimated. <b>Skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>tests</b> were performed with three common allergens and with 11 allergens {{likely to be found}} in bakery dust, including mites and moulds. Of the participants in the main exposure group, 35 % reported chest symptoms which in 13 % were work related. The corresponding figures for nasal symptoms were 38 % and 19 %. Symptoms, lung function, bronchial reactivity, and response to <b>skin</b> <b>prick</b> <b>tests</b> were related to current or past exposure to dust using logistic or linear regression analysis as appropriate.
