5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, {{along with}} their father Lawrence and sister Candace, go to an Egyptian-themed movie theater where they <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> about two archeologists who {{discover}} an undead mummy. Phineas and Ferb are inspired {{to find their own}} mummy and go out to the basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a mummy. Candace sees them going off to do this and follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the mummy and capturing her.|$|E

500|$|Barjatya {{later told}} India Abroad, [...] "My attempt {{in this movie}} has been to reexpose the cinema-going public to the quintessential family life ... not {{to make people feel}} that they have come to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> but make them feel as if they have come to visit a big joint family that is {{preparing}} for a wedding". The story was constructed differently than what was popular at the time. There were no villains, violence, or battles between good and evil. From conception to finished product, the film took four years. Madhuri Dixit was paid a salary of [...] for playing the role of Nisha. Thereafter she became highest paid movie star (Males and Females) that remained till 2002.|$|E

500|$|R.E.M. started {{recording}} Reckoning at Reflection Sound in Charlotte, North Carolina, on December 8, 1983. The group recorded {{over two}} eight-day stretches around Christmas 1983, separated by {{two weeks of}} canceled studio time that allowed the band to play a show in Greensboro, North Carolina, go out to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> and shoot a video in the studio. While the studio diary listed 16 days for recording, the album sleeve later claimed the album was recorded in 14 days, while in interviews Buck at times commented that the album was recorded in 11 days. The producers both disputed that the sessions were that short; Dixon insisted that {{they were at the}} studio for at least 25 days (during which he worked eighteen-hour days), while Easter said [...] "When I read 'eleven days' I thought, what the fuck! It was twenty days, which was still short, but it's not eleven." ...|$|E
500|$|With a {{loan from}} the West Bengal government, Ray finally {{completed}} the film. It was released in 1955 to great critical and popular success. It earned numerous prizes and had long runs in both India and abroad. In India, {{the reaction to the}} film was enthusiastic; The Times of India wrote that [...] "It is absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema [...] Pather Panchali is pure cinema." [...] In the United Kingdom, Lindsay Anderson wrote a glowing review of the film. But, the reaction was not uniformly positive. After watching the movie, François Truffaut is reported to have said, [...] "I don't want to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> of peasants eating with their hands." [...] Bosley Crowther, then the most influential critic of The New York Times, wrote a scathing review of the film. Its American distributor Ed Harrison was worried Crowther's review would dissuade audiences, but the film had an exceptionally long run when released in the United States.|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} was not uniformly positive. On seeing the film, François Truffaut {{is reported to}} have said, [...] "I don't want to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> of peasants eating with their hands." [...] Bosley Crowther, the most influential critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1958, [...] "Any picture as loose in structure or as listless in tempo as this one is would barely pass as a 'rough cut' with the editors in Hollywood", even though he praised its gradually emerging poignancy and poetic quality. The Harvard Crimson argued in 1959 that its fragmentary nature [...] "contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through." [...] Early in the 1980s, Ray was criticised by Nargis Dutt, parliamentarian and former actress, for [...] "exporting poverty". Darius Cooper writes that while many critics celebrated the Apu trilogy [...] "as a eulogy of third-world culture, others criticized it for what they took to be its romanticization of such a culture".|$|E

500|$|The feminist {{film critic}} Molly Haskell also wrote an {{approving}} {{review of the}} film in the Village Voice: [...] "In a world, an industry, and particularly a genre which values the new and improved product above all, it {{is nothing short of}} miraculous to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> which dares to go backward, a technological artefact which has nobly deteriorated into a human being. I speak of the new and obsolete James Bond, played by a man named George Lazenby, who seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates." [...] Haskell was also affected by the film's emotional ending: [...] "The love between Bond and his Tracy begins as a payment and ends as a sacrament. After ostensibly getting rid of the bad guys, they are married. They drive off to a shocking, stunning ending. Their love, being too real, is killed by the conventions it defied. But they win the final victory by calling, unexpectedly, upon feeling. Some of the audience hissed, I was shattered. If you like your Bonds with happy endings, don't go." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} is not {{essentially}} experimental, at several points it undermines the narrative reality. James Bernardoni notes Allen's way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film. In one famous scene, Allen's character, in line to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini's and Marshall McLuhan's work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off camera to personally correct the man's errors. Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, [...] "mental subtitles" [...] convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner doubts. An animated scene—with artwork based on the comic strip Inside Woody Allen—depicts Alvy and Annie {{in the guise of}} the Wicked Queen from Snow White. Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the [...] "fourth wall" [...] is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in another he shrugs off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable [...] "wish-fulfillment." [...] Allen chose to have Alvy break the fourth wall, he explained, [...] "because I felt many {{of the people in the}} audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them." ...|$|E

[...] Agee remembered the theater's [...] "exhilarating smell of stale tobacco, rank sweat, perfume and dirty drawers."

2500|$|The {{film was}} praised for its stylistic innovations. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated: [...] "It smashes {{down the walls}} of habit that {{surround}} so many movies.

[...] Edward Guthmann from the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "It's great to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> so courageous and affecting, so committed to its own differentness." [...] However, criticism was directed at its storyline. Jonathan Foreman of the New York Post described the film as [...] "meretricious fakery" [...] and called it [...] "so unrelenting in its manipulative sentimentality that, {{if it had been}} made by an American and shot in a more conventional manner, it would be seen as a bad joke." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{positive}} reviews {{came from}} British film critics, and later retrospective analysis. Mark Kermode noted that many {{have come to}} consider the film a [...] "masterpiece". Among the positive reviews, Kim Newman from the British magazine Sight & Sound stated: [...] "The film's many moments of horror [...] demonstrate just how tidy, conventional and domesticated the generic horror movie of the 1980s and 1990s has become". Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine gave the film a four out of four stars, and the magazine later listed it in their '100 Essential Films' list. Appearing on the podcast The Cinephiliacs, filmmaker James Gray called it [...] "an incredible film," [...] "a masterpiece," [...] and [...] "a classic {{example of how the}} critics get it wrong." [...] Further speaking of Fire Walk with Me, he said, [...] "I've never <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> that's been made in the last 30 years... haven't <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> in the last thirty years, in America, which so asks us to understand and be in the shoes of a person suffering so profoundly.

She was a Romanian immigrant threatened with deportation for [...] "low moral character" [...] and offered agents information on Dillinger {{in exchange for their}} help in preventing her deportation.

Cumpănaş revealed that Dillinger was spending his time with another prostitute, Polly Hamilton, and that she and the couple would be going to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> together on the following day. She agreed to wear an orange dress, so police could easily identify her. She was unsure which of two theaters they would be attending, the Biograph or the Marbro.

2500|$|After the {{incident}} McQueen's stepfather persuaded {{his mother to}} sign a court order stating that McQueen was incorrigible, remanding him to the California Junior Boys Republic in Chino.

Well, you can pretty well guess they're gonna {{have something to say}} about that. I paid my dues with the other fellows quite a few times. I got my lumps, no doubt about it. The other guys in the bungalow had ways of paying you back for interfering with their well-being." [...] Ultimately McQueen became a role model when he was elected to the Boys Council, a group who set the rules and regulations governing the boys' lives. He eventually left the Boys Republic at age 16. When he later became famous he regularly returned to talk to the boys and retained a lifelong association.|$|E
