40|$|New Zealand's {{national}} lamb weaning percentage {{has been}} around 100 % since 1960 (Walpole, 1995), and as prolificacy is {{a major determinant of}} productivity and economic efficiency in sheep production systems (Nitter, 1987 IN: Maria, 1995; Gabina, 1989), the improvement of this trait at a national level is of significant economic importance. The development of more reproductively efficient sheep can be achieved through <b>selection</b> within breeds, <b>by</b> <b>crossbreeding,</b> or <b>by</b> importing new genetic material. This study examines two ways of improving the prolificacy of sheep; <b>by</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> newly imported genetic material with the New Zealand Romney, and <b>by</b> altering the <b>selection</b> methods for prolificacy by using an alternative selection character. The Finnish Landrace and East Friesian are both prolific sheep breeds, and their introduction to New Zealand has provided a potential opportunity to increase prolificacy in New Zealand <b>by</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> them with the current New Zealand sheep population. By assessing their performances under New Zealand environmental and management practices, and in relation to and with current New Zealand sheep, their potential may be predicted. It is important to take advantage of both their additive gene effects and their non-additive genetic interactions (or heterosis) with current New Zealand breeds. The aim should be to achieve an ideal breed composition either as a new composite breed or as regularly reconstituted crossbred stock. The additive and non-additive figures can be used to predict the phenotypic performances for different breed composites by simulating the outcomes of crosses between different ram types made up of different combinations of the breeds with current New Zealand sheep...|$|R

50|$|In {{the wake}} of {{modernization}} and specialization in animal husbandry, many Turano-Mongolian breeds have been replaced either outright or through extensive <b>crossbreeding</b> <b>by</b> modern international breeds and become extinct. Thus, for example, of the Siberian breeds only the Yakutian cattle remain, and at that only in very small numbers.

40|$|This review collect {{information}} related to various factors that affect the productive and reproductive characteristics of sows, {{with the purpose of}} get information to assist and promote the maximization of reproductive performance of sows. The swine production {{is one of the most}} advanced areas of the livestock sector, especially by their high increase, efficiency and competitiveness and, in the last decades, the sows passed by an enormous increment in their capacity to produce piglets, accompanied by profound physiological changes, behavioral and consequently management production. Currently, the genetic selection of sows and the crossing prioritizes characteristics related to increase productivity, aiming use the best available races, in conjunction with genetic improvement <b>by</b> <b>selection</b> and <b>crossbreeding</b> systems, are the principal means to improve reproductive and productive efficiency of sows. With the advent of new technologies developed in modern swine production, the genetic improvement programs have advanced substantially in order to contribute to greater productive and reproductive efficiency of pigs, but also for industry profitability. However, continuous research in the area should be carried out in order to maximize the productivity of female and reduce the economic losses...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} slaughter performances and carcass characteristics at European Mouflon (Ovis orientalis musimon Lin.).

First generation hybrids (F 1) were obtained <b>by</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> between females of sheep breed Tigaie and males of mouflon (FT x MM). The studied characteristics were slaughter yield on hot and chilled carcass, the participation percentage of the cut parts from live weight and from the whole carcass structure. At the age of 90 days 10 lambs were sacrificed (5 mouflons and 5 hybrids FTxMM). For slaughter performances, superior values {{were obtained from the}} hybrid lambs. Thus, slaughter yield calculated had higher at FTxMM (P< 0. 05) as compared with values obtained at mouflon. The participation percentage of the cut parts from the live weight and from the whole carcass structure had the lower values at mouflon lambs compared to FTxMM hybrids. Results from this study showed that hybrid genotype significantly influenced the studied characteristics and have revealed the superiority of the hybrids lambs against mouflon lambs...|$|R
