2500|$|According to NBC {{reports in}} September 2013, the US {{government}} had {{been concerned about}} the reliability of evacuation slides for decades: [...] "Federal safety reports and government databases reveal that the NTSB has recommended multiple improvements to escape slides and that the Federal Aviation Administration has collected thousands of complaints about them." [...] Two months before the accident at SFO, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive ordering inspection of the slide release mechanism on certain Boeing 777 aircraft, so as to detect and correct corrosion that might interfere with <b>slide</b> <b>deployment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Inadvertent <b>slide</b> <b>deployment</b> {{occurs when}} the {{operator}} of the aircraft door attempts {{to open the door}} when it is in the armed position. This costs the industry millions in lost revenue every year, estimated at $20 million in North America by cabin crew alone.|$|E

40|$|A {{concept for}} the remote {{delivery}} of carbon-supported <b>sliding</b> payloads <b>deployment</b> from circling fixed-wing aircraft is presented. The payload uses a taut cable deployed from a circling aircraft that supports structure for sliding payloads from high altitudes to the ground. The cable tip is anchored for accurate positioning of cable tip on the ground. The cable dynamics is simulated showing a compulsory use of braking {{to slow the}} descent of the payload. The numerical simulation studies show that certain cable configurations provide better stability during sliding payload development. Braking system is used to reduce the velocity of the payload at the ground and prevent the payload from tripping the cable dynamic instability. The studies also show that additional braking is used when payload approaches the ground to reduce impact velocities. Optimization design of an appropriate braking system is an important aspect that is considered for the realization of aircraft delivery system...|$|R
