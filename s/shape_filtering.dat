40|$|International audiencePer-tone pulse shaping {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} time domain spectral shaping for DMT transmitters, e. g. VDSL modems. It shapes the spectrum of individual tones such that the stop band energy of each tone can be minimized. This in particular enables transmitter to use more tones without violating the PSD mask constraint for data transmission. In pertone pulse shaping based DMT transmitters a fixed length pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>filter</b> is typically used for every tone. The tones {{in the middle of the}} pass band however, contribute less to the overall stop band energy, so that using a high order pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>filter</b> for these tones does not result in a significant reduction of the stop band energy. As a result a significant number of pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>filter</b> taps are wasted on the tones in the middle of the pass band and do not bring any performance gain. Using a variable length pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>filter</b> which is designed such that the PSD mask constraint is not violated can then significantly reduce the total number of pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>filter</b> taps without compromising performance.

40|$|The {{extraction}} of {{different parts of}} the spectrum from complex-valued synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is equivalent to selecting a same number of low-resolution images, each of which is acquired using a sub-antenna. This subantenna {{can be viewed as a}} part of azimuth squint angle and a part of the range chirp bandwidth in the full synthetic aperture. Due to this process, which is also called sub-aperture extraction, it is not possible to apply traditional bandpass filters to complex-valued SAR images using modulated window-based multi-scale approaches (such as wavelet decomposition). Thus, in this paper we proposes the use of a chirplet-derived transform, that is, the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), as an alternative scaling approach, where the scaling is carried out in phase.

40|$|Abstract — The {{conventional}} receiver for DS-CDMA communications is the RAKE receiver {{which is}} a matched filter (MF), matched to the op-erations of spreading, pulse <b>shape</b> <b>filtering</b> and channel filtering. The RAKE receiver assumes a sparse/pathwise channel model so that the chan-nel matched filtering gets done pathwise, with delay adjustment and decor-relation per path and maximum-ratio combining of path contributions at the symbol rate. Original RAKE receivers work with continuous delays, which are tracked by an Early-Late scheme. This requires signal interpo-lation and leads to suboptimal treatment of diffuse portions in the channel impulse response. These disadvantages can be avoided by a discrete-time RAKE, operating at a certain oversampled rate. Proper sparse modeling of the channel is an approximation problem that requires exploitation of the limited bandwidth of the pulse shape. We propose and simulate a number of sparse channel approximation algorithms {{along the lines of}} Matching Pursuit, of which the Recursive Early-Late (REL) approach appears most promising. We also analyze and simulate the effect of channel estimation on the RAKE output SINR.

40|$|Abstract- The {{conventional}} receiver for DS-CDMA com-munications is the RAKE receiver. The RAKE receiver is a matched filter, {{matched to}} {{the operations of}} spreading, pulse <b>shape</b> <b>filtering</b> and channel filtering. Such a matched filter max-imizes the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) at its output if the interference plus noise is white. This may be ap-proximately the case if user-dependent scrambling (aperiodic spreading) is used. This is one option for the uplink in 3 rd gen-eration systems. However, {{this is not the}} case in the synchronous downlink with cell-dependent scrambling, orthogonal codes and a common channel. In this paper we propose a restricted class of linear receivers for the downlink, exhibiting a limited or no com-plexity increase with respect to the RAKE receiver. The linear receivers in this class have the same structure as a RAKE re-ceiver, but the channel matched filter gets replaced by an equal-izer filter that is designed to maximize the SINR at the output of the receiver. The complexity of the equalizer filter is variable and can possibly be taken to be as low as in the RAKE receiver (same structure as the channel matched filter), while its adap-tation guarantees improved performance with respect to (w. r. t.) the RAKE receiver. Various adaptation strategies are considered and compared in simulations. I...|$|E

We employ probabilistic skin color detection followed by the proposed morphological algorithms and related <b>shape</b> <b>filtering</b> for fast and reliable segmentation of hands and head. This is then fed to our hand tracking system which emphasizes robust handling of occlusions based on forward-backward prediction and incorporation of probabilistic constraints.

We further propose that the handshape features extracted via the fitting of this model are utilized to construct in an unsupervised way basic HSUs.

30|$|Nowadays, {{the most}} {{well-known}} multicarrier modulation is the orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) modulation. Thanks to the cyclic prefix (CP) insertion, OFDM technique provides a high robustness against the multipath fading channels. However, since OFDM uses CP and also rectangular pulse <b>shape</b> <b>filtering</b> that causes some disadvantages concerning the spectrum control and efficiency, to tackle this issue, filter bank multicarrier systems with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC/OQAM) was proposed {{as an alternative to}} CP-OFDM. Many works on the comparison between FBMC/OQAM and OFDM {{can be found in the}} literature such as [1]. One of the features of FBMC/OQAM is the possibility of shaping subcarrier signals with well-localized prototype filter in time and frequency axis [1]. That is, sidelobes steeply decay and allow a better spectrum control and offer an important resistance against time and frequency misalignment. Thus, FBMC/OQAM enables asynchronous multiple access and reduces intercarrier interference since each subcarrier signal is spectrally confined in a band and has negligible interference to other bands. In cognitive radios, the filtering capability of FBMC systems makes them the perfect choice for filling in the spectrum holes [1]. In the other hand, thanks to its spectral confinements, FBMC-based systems can reduce their guard band at the frequency boundaries, thereby increasing the spectral efficiency. Moreover, the absence of CP and any guard interval in time domain also contributes to increase the spectral efficiency. Many research works have been carried out in the issues related to doubly spread channels, and it has been shown that FBMC modulations are far better choices when compared to OFDM [2 – 4]. For instance, the author in [1] clearly shows the outperformance of the FBMC over OFDM in terms of the resilience to the doubly dispersive channels under the same assumptions of channel mobility and symbol density.|$|E

In order to be performed in clinical routine, such analysis has to be compatible with the general protocol for thorax imaging based on multi-slice CT (MSCT), which does not involve the use of contrast agent for vessels enhancement. Despite the fact that a visual assessment of the pulmonary vascular tree is facilitated by the natural contrast existing between vessels and lung parenchyma, a quantitative analysis becomes quickly tedious due to the high spatial density and subdivision complexity of these anatomical structures. In this paper, we develop an automated 3 D approach for the segmentation of the pulmonary vessels in MSCT allowing further quantification facilities for the lung function. The proposed approach combines mathematical morphology and discrete geometry operators in order to reach distal small caliber blood vessels and to preserve the border with the wall of the bronchial tree which features identical intensity values. In this respect, the pulmonary field is first roughly segmented using thresholding, and the trachea and the main bronchi removed. The lung shape is then regularized by morphological alternate filtering and the high opacities (vessels, bronchi, and other eventual pathologic features) selected. After the attenuation of the bronchus wall for large and medium airways, the set of vessel candidates are obtained by morphological grayscale reconstruction and binarization. The residual bronchus wall components are then removed by means of a geometrical <b>shape</b> <b>filtering</b> which includes skeletonization and cylindrical shape estimation.

The first-ever reported L-band Reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) is presented based on InP-base material. A theoretical model is developed to estimate the optical gain and the saturation power of this device compared to a conventional SOA. Experiments on this device design show long-range telecom wavelength operation, with polarization-independent gain of greater than 20 dB, and low saturation output power of 0 dBm suitable for PON applications. Next, {{the effect of the}} amplified spontaneous emission noise of RSOA devices on WDM-PON system is investigated. It is shown through theoretical modeling and simulations that the RSOA noise combined with receiver noise statistics increase probability of error, and induce considerable power penalties to the WDM-PON system. By improving the coupling efficiencies, and by distributing more current flow to the input of these devices, steps can be taken to improve device noise characteristics. Further, in spectrally-spliced WDM-PONs deploying RSOAs, the effect of AWG filter shape on system performance is investigated. Simulation modeling and experiments show that deployment of Flat-band AWGs is critical for reducing the probability of error caused by AWG spectral <b>shape</b> <b>filtering.</b> Flat-band athermal AWGs in comparison to Gaussin-shape counterparts satisfy the maximum acceptable error probability requirements, and reduce the power penalty associated with filtering effect. In addition, detuning between two AWG center wavelengths impose further power penalties to the WDM-PON system.

The gain section provides locking of one FP mode to a seed source wavelength, while the phase modulator allows for adjusting the wavelength of the internal modes by tuning bias current to maintain mode-locking. This device counters any mode drifts caused by temperature variations, and allows for cooler-less operation over a wide range of currents.
