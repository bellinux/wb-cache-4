5000|$|Barron Field was {{appointed}} as the replacement for Bent in May 1816. Field's {{arrival in the}} colony signified that the court would actually start sitting. However, Field's independence was to prove questionable. Soon after his arrival, he instructed an English attorney practising in the colony to sue for the sum of £424 owed to a London merchant who had given Field his power of attorney. This was unusual as Field was a litigant in his own court and would have therefore decided his own case. Unfortunately for Field, whilst he was naturally successful in his action, the English attorney didn't transfer the money recovered to Field. Field then sued {{the attorney for the}} sum. Field further threatened to <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> attorney <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> of attorneys (or in other words, disbar him) if the money wasn't paid. Even when the attorney provided the money, Field still struck <b>off</b> <b>the</b> attorney. [...] Royal Commissioner John Thomas Bigge was later to criticize Field for the latter action.|$|R

40|$|To policymakers, {{the major}} {{attraction}} {{of work and}} training programs for welfare recipients is that they hold out the prospect that recipients can be moved <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rolls</b> and into self-sufficiency in the private labor market, thereby decreasing welfare costs and caseloads. This paper considers the possibility that such programs may also affect the attractiveness of welfare in the first place, either by making welfare less desirable because the work- training program {{is viewed as a}} burden, or by making it more desirable because the program is viewed favorably by potential applicants. Such responses are termed "entry-rate effects. " Some empirical estimates of these effects are presented which suggest that entry-rate responses, whether positive or negative, may affect the caseload more than the direct effect of the programs in moving recipients <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rolls.</b> ...|$|R
