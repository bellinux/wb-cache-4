40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} effects of added native tapioca starch; N and <b>starch</b> <b>ester</b> (starch acetate; A, starch phosphate; P, and acetylated distarch phosphate; PA) on the cooking characteristics and textural stability of frozen noodles. Physical and chemical analyses were done after the starches were differentiated based on noodle starch added at 10, 20 and 30 %. The research results showed that added of <b>starch</b> <b>ester</b> showed lower viscosity break down (BD), (p< 0. 05) and viscosity set back (SB), with the maximum decrease in the starch phosphate (BD values decreased from 110. 75 ± 2. 83 RVU to 63. 66 ± 5. 87 RVU; SB values decreased from 109. 22 ± 1. 51 RVU to 67. 00 ± 3. 86 RVU), but the set back value of acetylated distarch phosphate (PA) increased along {{with an increase in}} starch added. The starch added of starch phosphate showed increased peak viscosity (p< 0. 05) (increased from 255. 47 ± 2. 34 RVU to 291. 42 ± 0. 82 RVU), holding viscosity (increased from 144. 72 ± 0. 81 RVU to 227. 75 ± 5. 24 RVU), final viscosity (increased from 253. 94 ± 0. 97 RVU to 294. 75 ± 1. 38 RVU). The starch added of acetate showed decreased peak viscosity (decreased from 255. 47 ± 2. 34 RVU to 218. 39 ± 2. 55 RVU), final viscosity (decreased from 253. 94 ± 0. 97 RVU to 225. 42 ± 2. 01 RVU). For the swelling power, the starch added of native tapioca starch, starch acetate and starch phosphate showed increased swelling power (p< 0. 05), among which the starch phosphate showed the maximum increase (the swelling power increased from 14. 66 ± 0. 24 to 30. 40 ± 0. 35 at 95 ℃). Moreover, there were no changes in the swelling power of acetylated distarch phosphate. The results of the cooking characteristic of starch added of noodles at different starch levels showed that there was a weight gain in the starch added of starch (p< 0. 05), which could be caused by the increase in the swelling power of starch added. There was a decrease in the cooking loss of starch added, but there were no changes in the acetylated distarch phosphate noodle, instead there was a slight increase, which could be caused by short cooking time. The results of textural analysis of noodles showed that an increase in the various starch added, would decrease the hardness, chewiness, adhesiveness and tensile strength of the noodles. After the freeze-thaw cycles of the noodles, the thickness increased, while the hardness, chewiness, tensile strength and tensile distance decreased. The break down value showed a negative relationship (p< 0. 01) with the cooked weight gain of noodle and a positive relationship (p< 0. 05) with the hardness, chewiness, adhesiveness and tensile strength of noodle. The set back value showed a positive relationship (p< 0. 001) with the cooking loss of noodles and a negative relationship (p< 0. 05) with the Elasticity of noodle. The swelling power showed a positive relationship (p< 0. 05) with the cooking weight gain and cooking volume gain of noodles and a negative relationship (p< 0. 05) with the cooking loss of noodles. 本論文擬探討天然樹薯澱粉(Native tapioca starch；N) 及不同酯化修飾澱粉：醋酸酯化澱粉(Starch acetate；A) 、磷酸酯化澱粉(Starch phosphate；P) 與乙醯化磷酸二澱粉(Acetylated Distarch Phosphate；PA) 的添加對冷凍熟麵條烹煮特性及質地穩定性的影響。先將澱粉分別對麵粉添加 10 %、 20 %、 30 %三種比例後進行理化性分析，分析結果顯示，添加酯化修飾澱粉可顯著的(p< 0. 05) 降低黏度裂解值(Break Down；BD) 和黏度回昇值(Set Back；SB) ，以添加磷酸酯化澱粉(P) 的降幅最大， (BD值由 110. 75 ± 2. 83 RVU下降至 63. 66 ± 5. 87 RVU；SB值由 109. 22 ± 1. 51 RVU下降至 67. 00 ± 3. 86 RVU) ，但添加乙醯化磷酸二澱粉(PA) 黏度回昇值(SB) 則隨著添加量增加而增加黏度。添加磷酸酯化澱粉(P) 可顯著的(p< 0. 05) 提升尖峰黏度(由 255. 47 ± 2. 34 RVU上升至 291. 42 ± 0. 82 RVU) 、恆溫黏度(由 144. 72 ± 0. 81 RVU上升至 227. 75 ± 5. 24 RVU) 、最終黏度(由 253. 94 ± 0. 97 RVU上升至 294. 75 ± 1. 38 RVU) ；添加醋酸酯化澱粉(A) 可顯著的(p< 0. 05) 降低尖峰黏度(由 255. 47 ± 2. 34 RVU下降至 218. 39 ± 2. 55 RVU) 、最終黏度(由 253. 94 ± 0. 97 RVU下降至 225. 42 ± 2. 01 RVU) 。在膨潤力(Swelling Powder) 方面，添加天然樹薯澱粉(N) 、醋酸酯化澱粉(A) 和磷酸酯化澱粉(P) 均顯著增加膨潤力(p< 0. 05) ，其中以磷酸酯化澱粉(P) 增加的幅度最大(於 95 ℃時膨潤力由 14. 66 ± 0. 24 提升至 30. 40 ± 0. 35) ，另添加乙醯化磷酸二澱粉(PA) 的麵條粉，膨潤力無顯著改變。 將添加不同澱粉比例的麵粉製成麵條後進行烹煮特性分析與質地分析，烹煮特性分析結果顯示，澱粉之添加有顯著增加麵條煮麵增重率之趨勢(p< 0. 05) ，其造成的原因可能與澱粉添加後膨潤力增加有關；澱粉的添加會顯著降低麵條的煮麵損失率，但添加乙醯化磷酸二澱粉(PA) 的麵條無顯著降低，反而稍微增加，煮麵時間短可能是造成其增加的原因。熟麵條質地分析結果顯示，隨著各種澱粉添加量的增加，會降低麵條的硬度(Hardness) 、咀嚼性(Chewiness) 、附著度(Adhesiveness) 和抗拉強度(Tensile strength) 。麵條在冷凍-解凍循環後，厚度(Thickness) 會增加，硬度、咀嚼度、抗拉強度和抗拉距離會降低。 麵粉理化特性的黏度裂解值(BD) 與麵條煮麵增重率有顯著的負相關性(p< 0. 01) ，而與麵條硬度、咀嚼性、附著性和抗拉強度有顯著的正相關性(p< 0. 05) ；黏度回升值(SB) 與麵條的煮麵損失率有顯著的正相關性(p< 0. 001) ，而與麵條感官品評的彈性(Elasticity) 有顯著的負相關性(p< 0. 05) ；膨潤力與麵條的煮麵增重率和煮麵增容率有顯著的正相關性 (p< 0. 05) ，而與煮麵損失率有顯著的負相關性(p< 0. 05) 。摘 要	 1 目 錄	V 圖 次	VIII 表 次	X 前 言	 1 第一章、文獻整理	 2 一、冷凍麵條及其市場概況	 2 (一) 麵條(Noodles) 	 2 (二) 冷凍麵條之特性及種類	 3 (三) 冷凍麵條市場概況	 5 二、冷凍熟麵條之製備及質地特性	 7 (一) 冷凍麵條之製備	 7 (二) 冷凍熟麵條之質地特性	 7 (三) 冷凍麵條品質影響因子	 13 三、澱粉之介紹	 23 (一) 天然澱粉 (Native starch) 	 23 (二) 修飾澱粉 (Modified starches) 	 30 第二章、材料與方法	 39 一、實驗架構	 39 二、材料	 39 (一) 麵粉 (Wheat flour) 	 39 (二) 澱粉 (Starch) 	 39 (三) 鹽 (Salt) 	 39 三、實驗方法	 41 (一) 麵條粉理化特性分析	 41 (二) 麵條製備	 42 (三) 麵條烹煮特性分析	 43 (四) 麵條質地分析	 45 (五) 冷凍-解凍試驗(Freeze-Thaw cycles) 	 47 (六) 統計分析	 47 第三章、結果與討論	 48 一、酯化澱粉添加對麵粉理化性質之影響	 48 (一) 快速糊化黏度分析(Rapid viscosity analyzer, RVA) 	 48 (二) 示差熱掃瞄分析(Differential scanning calorimeter, DSC) 	 54 (三) 膨潤力(Swelling power) 	 56 (四) 溶解度 (Solubility) 	 57 (五) 凝膠質地(Gel texture) 	 58 二、酯化澱粉添加對麵條烹煮特性之影響	 67 (一) 烹煮時間(Cooking time) 	 67 (二) 煮麵損失率(Cooking loss) 	 67 (三) 煮麵增重率(Cooked weigh gain) 	 68 (四) 煮麵增容率(Cooked volume gain) 	 68 (五) 冷凍-解凍對麵條烹煮特性之影響	 68 三、酯化澱粉添加對麵條質地之影響	 73 (一) 質地剖面分析(Texture profile analysis, TPA) 	 73 (二) 抗拉強度(Tensile strength) 	 88 (三) 微細構造(SEM) 	 94 (四) 感官品評(Sensory evaluation) 	 94 四、麵條特性與澱粉特性之相關性	 100 (一) 澱粉理化特性與麵條烹煮特性之相關性	 100 (二) 澱粉理化特性與麵條質地之相關性	 100 (三) 麵條烹煮特性與麵條質地之相關性	 101 第四章、結論	 115 參考文獻	 116 附 錄	 12...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{consisted}} of four chapters. Chapter one contains. an introductory part including scope and {{the objectives of}} the research. 'Since the present research is divided in to three major parts, chapter two, three and four is arranged accordingly. Each chapter includes an introduction discussing the relevant literature, the experimental work, results and discussions and finally, the conclusions drawn. The contents of this thesis can be best summarized as follows. Mechanical properties and biodegradability of composites of LDPE with tapioca Starch A series of LDPE/starch composites containing different amounts of starch (as wt %) were prepared using tapioca starch in its native granular form. Mixing was done by dissolving LDPE in cyclohexane pre-heated to its boiling point and subsequently dispersing starch granules by using Silverson emulsifier. The composites were studied by using Fourier Transform Infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR). The failure modes, mechanical properties, water absorption, biodegradation and the biodegradation after thermal incubation were investigated {{as a function of the}} composition of the composite. It was found that the incorporation of starch into LDPE matrix has reduced the ductility of the composite. The mechanical properties of the composites, especially the tensile strength and elongation at break were significantly low compared to those of neat LDPE. A significant improvement in modulus was shown by the composites. It was found that the mechanical properties were depended on the composition of the composite. The extent of the biodegradability, after exposure to a-amylase enzyme solution, was assessed by weight loss measurements and loss of mechanical properties such as tensile strength and percentage elongation. It was found that these composites are biodegradable and the rate of biodegradation increases with increasing starch content. The extent of biodegradation after thermal incubation was assessed by the loss of tensile strength measurements of the composites after incubation of the samples in an air circulation oven at 70 0 C and subsequently exposing to α-amylase enzyme solution. It was found that the degradability of the samples was not significantly affected by the thermal incubation. Preparation and characterization of long chain fatty acid esters of tapioca starch A series of starch esters with different degree of substitution (DS) were prepared and studied. The esters were prepared by acylation of tapioca starch with appropriate acid chlorides such as stearoyl and oleoyl chlorides. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed the formation of the starch esters and their DS. As a measurement of the DS of an ester the peak height ratio responsible for O-H bond stretching to C=O bond stretching of the esters were considered. The DS of starch stearates were 5. 3, 4. 5, 2. 6, 2. 0 and 1. 60. The DS of starch oleates were 3. 55, 2. 0, 1. 90 and 1. 21. With increasing DS the color intensities of the esters were improved. Melting temperatures of the esters were determined by using Differential thermal analyzer. The thermo-oxidation degradation of tapioca starch and starch esters, were assessed by using Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, after the incubation of the samples in an air circulation oven at 70 °C. The presence of thermo-oxidative degradation was shown in both types of the starch esters. Starch has not shown thermo-oxidative degradation. Mechanical properties and biodegradability of composites of LDPE with fatty acid esters of tapioca starch A seris of Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) composites containing different amounts of fatty esters of starch were prepared. Mixing was done by dissolving LDPE, in cyclohexane pre-heated to its boiling temperature, and subsequently, mixing starch esters using Siverson Emulsifier. Two different types of starch esters, starch stearate and oleate with different (DS) were utilized in the preparation of these LDPE composites. Polarized light micrographs were used to assess the miscibility of LDPE with starch esters. The miscibility of the components was found to be improved with increasing DS of the ester. Water absorption, mechanical properties, biodegradation and biodegradation after thermal incubation were investigated as a function of the composition of the composite. Comparing with the LDPE/starch composites a significant reduction in the water absorption was resulted in the LDPE/starch ester composites. It was found that as the amount of esters increases in the composite, the tensile strength and especially the elongation at break decrease non-linearly. The LDPE/starch ester composites containing starch esters of high DS have shown improved tensile properties than those of LDPE/starch composites. As expected, the fatty ester chains in the <b>starch</b> <b>ester</b> molecules have not shown the plasticizing effect in the composite. The percentage elongation properties were significantly reduced with the introduction of the esters into LDPE. The extent of the biodegradability of the composites after exposure to a-amylase and lipase enzyme solutions was assessed by weight loss and mechanical properties measurements. The rate of biodegradation of LDPE/starch ester composites was relatively low compared to that of LDPE/starch composites. The rate of biodegradation of these LDPE/starch ester composites further decreases with increasing DS of the ester in the composite. The extent of the biodegradation of the composites after incubation of the samples at air circulation oven at 70 °C and subsequently immersing in the enzymatic solutions was assessed by the tensile strength measurements. It was found that the degradability of the ester composites was significantly high and the degradation rate increases with the increasing DS of the ester. Highest rate of degradation was observed in the LDPE/starch ester composite containing starch oleate of the highest DS...|$|E

40|$|Esterification {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} methods to alter the structure of starch granules and improve its applications. Conventionally, <b>starch</b> <b>esters</b> are prepared by conventional or dual modification techniques, which have the disadvantages of being expensive, have regent overdoses, and are time-consuming. In addition, the degree of substitution (DS) is often considered as the primary factor in view of its contribution to estimate substituted groups of <b>starch</b> <b>esters.</b> In order to improve the detection accuracy and production efficiency, different detection techniques, including titration, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermal gravimetric analysis/infrared spectroscopy (TGA/IR) and headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC), have been developed for DS. This paper gives a comprehensive overview on the recent advances in DS analysis and starch esterification techniques. Additionally, the advantages, limitations, some perspectives on future trends of these techniques and the applications of their derivatives in the food industry are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Plastics {{made from}} fossil {{resources}} (a. o oil and gas) are very attractive materials {{for a broad}} range of applications. Examples are the use as packaging and construction materials. Its production has increased significantly since 1950, with a rate of almost 10 % every year. After use, plastics may end up in the environment and cause serious environmental problems. For instance, it has a high volume to weight ratio and is generally resistant to degradation. In combination with the current high prices for petrochemical products, there is a strong need for renewable alternatives for plastics from fossil resources. Starch-based biodegradable materials are considered interesting candidates to replace certain types of conventional plastics. Starch is relatively cheap and available from {{a broad range of}} plants. Starch is a polymer consisting of anhydroglucose (AHG) units. There are two types of polymers present in starch: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is essentially a linear polymer in which AHG units are predominantly connected through alpha-D-(1, 4) -glucosidic bonds, while amylopectin is branched polymer, containing periodic branches linked with the backbones through alpha-D-(1, 6) -glucosidic bonds. The content of amylose and amylopectine in starch varies and largely depends on the starch source. The use of virgin starch for packaging materials is restricted because it cannot be shaped to films with adequate mechanical properties (high percentage elongation, tensile and flexural strength). Starch is also too sensitive to water. Starch must therefore be modified before it can be applied as a biodegradable plastic. There are several starch modification methods available, such as thermoplasticization, blending with other materials, chemical modification or combinations thereof. The application of a number of prospective methods for developing starch-based biomaterials will be described in this thesis. Chemical grafting of biodegradable polyesters on the starch backbone is expected to result in less hydrophilic and thus less water sensitive materials with improved mechanical properties. The synthesis of such grafted products by the in situ ring opening polymerization (ROP) of the monomers on the hydroxyl groups of starch is unfortunately not very straightforward. The main reasons are the water sensitivity of common catalysts and the fact that starch is poorly or even insoluble in the common organic solvents used for ROP. The application of an alternative method involving hydrophobisation of starch by the introduction of large hydrophobic SiMe 3 groups followed by a ROP with a polyester precursor and subsequent removal of the SiMe 3 groups is expected to result in higher grafting efficiencies. To gain insight in the potential of this approach, we have initially performed research on the ROP with a simpler model system involving a simple protected mono-saccharide instead of starch. The results for the model system involving the ROP of p-dioxanone initiated by hydroxyl groups of a protected monosaccharide (1, 2; 3, 4 -di-O-isopropylidene-alpha-D-galactopyranose) using Al(OiPr) 3 as the catalyst, are described in Chapter 2. The polymerizations were performed at 60 - 100 °C, and off-white solid products with isolated yields of 30 - 96 % were obtained. The yield of the polymers was a function of the reaction temperature and the reaction time, with higher temperatures (100 °C) leading to lower yields. Average molecular weights of the products were between 970 and 6200 (7 – 58 monomer units) and were a clear function of the p-dioxanone/ 1, 2; 3, 4 -di-O-isopropylidene-alpha-D-galactopyranose ratio (at constant Al(OiPr) 3 intake), with higher ratios leading to higher molecular weights. A statistical model has been developed to quantify the effects of process variables (time, temperature and monomer: monosaccharide ratio) on the average degree of polymerization. Characterization of the products using 1 H- and 13 C-NMR as well as MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed the presence of significant amounts of p-dioxanone polymers with an isopropoxide end group (20 - 30 %) The knowledge obtained from the model system was applied for the synthesis of starch-g-poly-epsilon-caprolactone using hydrophobised silylated starch. The results are described in detail in Chapter 3. The synthetic procedure may be divided into three steps: hydrophobisation of starch by the introduction of SiMe 3 groups followed by in situ ROP, and subsequent removal of the silyl groups. The silylation reaction was performed using hexamethyl disilazane (HMDS) in DMSO/ toluene mixtures at 70 °C. Silylated starch with a low to medium DS (0. 46 - 0. 68) was obtained. The grafting of epsilon-caprolactone to the silylated starch by a ring-opening polymerisation catalysed by Al(OiPr) 3 was performed in THF at 50 oC. Poly-(epsilon) -caprolactone grafted silylated starch co-polymers with average chain length of 40 - 55 monomer units (molecular weight of 4500 - 6300) were obtained. The DS of the PCL chains was between 0. 21 - 0. 72, depending on the epsilon-CL to starch ratio. Considerable amounts of epsilon-CL homopolymers with isopropyl end-groups were also formed. The grafting efficiency for the desired reaction was 28 - 58 %. The silyl groups of the poly-(epsilon) -caprolactone grafted starch co-polymers were finally successfully removed using a mild dilute hydrochloric acid treatment in THF at room temperature. Esterification of starch with carboxylic acid derivatives {{is one of the oldest}} strategies to improve starch properties. Most of the previous starch esterification studies involved the use of short chain carboxylic acids (C 1 -C 4), and particularly acetic acid derivatives (C 2) have received considerable attention. The hydrophobicity of starch acetates is higher than virgin starch, but the products are still very brittle, even in the presence of plasticizers. The use of higher carboxylic (fatty) acid to esterify starch resulted in products with significantly improved mechanical properties and hydrophobicities. The synthesis of these fatty starch esters is, however, usually performed using fatty acid chlorides which are relatively expensive and rather corrosive. The use of methyl and glyceryl esters results in products with only relatively low DS. In Chapter 4 - 5, an alternative method for higher fatty starch esters by using fatty vinyl esters is reported. Chapter 4 describes the results of a preliminary study on the synthesis of long fatty esters of corn starch (starch-laurate and starch-stearate) using vinyl fatty esters. The starch esters were prepared by reacting starch with vinyl laurate or vinyl stearate in the presence of basic catalysts (Na 2 HPO 4, K 2 CO 3, and Na-acetate) in DMSO at 110 °C. The yellowish products were characterized by 1 H-, 13 C-NMR and FT-IR. The products have a broad range of degree of substitution (DS = 0. 24 - 2. 96). The DS of the products was a clear function of the chain length of the fatty ester, vinyl ester to starch ratio, and the type of catalyst. For low vinyl-ester to starch ratios, an increase in the vinyl-ester concentration led to higher product DS values. At higher ratios, the DS decreased, presumably due to a reduction of the polarity of the reaction medium. K 2 CO 3 and Na-acetate are superior with respect to activity when compared with Na 2 HPO 4. With these catalysts, products with a DS > 2. 4 could be obtained for both laurate and stearate esters. In Chapter 5, a systematic study, including statistical modelling on the synthesis of long fatty esters of corn starch (starch-laurate and starch-stearate) using corresponding vinyl fatty esters is reported. The thermal and mechanical properties of some representative product samples are also described. The starch esters were synthesized by reacting gelatinized starch with vinyl laurate or vinyl acetate in DMSO in the presence of basic catalysts (Na 2 HPO 4, K 2 CO 3, and Na-acetate). Statistically adequate (R 2 ≥ 0. 96 and P-value of ≤ 10 - 7) second-order mathematical models correlating the effect of process variables (vinyl to AHG-starch mol ratio, reaction temperature, catalyst intake, and catalyst basicity) to the DS of the <b>starch</b> <b>ester</b> products were developed. The DS of the products is a strong function of the basicity of the catalyst. Reaction temperature and catalyst intake also affect the product DS but only to a lesser extent. The use of Na 2 HPO 4 resulted in low-medium DS products (0. 3 - 1. 5 for starch laurate, 0. 07 - 1. 5 for starch stearate), while the use of K 2 CO 3 and CH 3 COONa catalysts resulted in medium-high DS products (2. 1 - 2. 9 for starch laurate, 1. 4 - 3 for starch stearate). High-DS products (DS= 2. 26 - 2. 39) are totally amorphous whereas the low-DS ones (DS= 1. 45 - 1. 75) are still partially crystalline. The thermal stability of the esterified products is higher than that of native starch. Mechanical tests show that the products have tensile strength (stress at break) between 2. 7 - 3. 5 MPa, elongation at break of 3 - 26 %, and modulus of elasticity of 46 - 113 MPa. The last part of this thesis deals with reactive blending of starch and biodegradable polymers using reactive interfacial agents. In Chapter 6, the synthesis of two polycaprolactone (PCL) -based reactive interfacial agents, PCL-g-glycidyl methacrylate (PCL-GMA) and PCL-g-diethyl maleate (PCL-g-DEM), and their use in compatibilising starch-PCL blends is described. The PCL-based compatibilisers were prepared by reacting a low molecular weight PCL (Mw 3000) with glycidyl methacrylate or diethyl maleate in the presence of benzyolperoxide initiator at 130 °C. A statistically adequate model (R 2 = 0. 957, P-value ≤ 10 - 9) has been developed to quantify the effects of process variables (monomer and initiator intake, mutual solubility of the monomer into the molten polymer) on the functionalisation degree (FD) of the GMA and DEM units to the PCL backbone. Highest values of the FD (up to 45 %) were observed for PCL-g-GMA, at relatively high GMA and BPO intakes. The FD values for PCL-g-DEM were considerably lower (up to 7 %). Both of the PCL-based compatibilisers improve the interfacial adhesion between the starch particles and the PCL matrix in starch/ PCL blends. As the result, the mechanical behavior of the compatibilised blends is in general different from that of pure PCL and of the corresponding uncompatibilised blends. In particular the elastic modulus for the compatibilised blends is significantly higher (reaching up to 430 MPa) than that of uncompatibilised ones (320 - 340 MPa). At a fixed starch content (20 %-wt), PCL-g-DEM seems to have slightly more efficient compatibilising effect than PCL-g-GMA as shown by blends morphology and elastic modulus values. This is in contrast with chemical reactivity and amount of chemical groups along the PCL backbone (both factors favorable to GMA as compared to DEM) but it is explainable on the basis of the group distribution along the PCL backbone. The latter hypothesis is indirectly confirmed by the observation that PCL-g-GMA becomes more efficient at relatively higher starch contents in the blends. ...|$|E
40|$|Lignocellulose is {{the most}} abundantly {{available}} raw material on earth and used since time immemorial as energy source as well as construction material (wood). For various reasons (CO 2 neutrality, decrease of oil in places etc.) substantial use of renewable resources is becoming ever more important. Lignocellulose offers good possibilities for creation of value {{in the field of}} material development caused by the low price. In this contribution a series of lignocelluloses like beech, spruce, poplar, wheat straw, and bagasse a fibrous residue of the sugarcane industry were treated by chemical modification to achieve thermoplastic resins. The esterifications of these different lignocelluloses were carried out with or without the use of commercial ILs. The highly substituted lignocellulose acetates and propionates were processed in an extruder and an injection molding machine to achieve test specimen for the investigation of the mechanical properties. In dependence on the content of acetyl or/and propionyl groups, the content of plasticizer and in dependence on the lignocellulose a strength in the range of 15 - 30 MPa, stiffness in the range of 0. 5 - 2. 3 GPa and elongation at break in the range of 1 - 29 % were achieved. Concerning recovery of the used solvents it was possible to recycle the IL and reuse it as dissolution media for synthesis of lignocellulose acetates, but the mechanical properties of these products have decreased. In comparison to lignocelluloses also starch is a low cost biomaterial which becomes more and more important in the field of bioplastics. Starch itself can be processed by thermal treatment using a plasticizer to give e. g. several kinds of packaging material. However the high water uptake of such materials together with relative low values for tensile strength or modulus is a disadvantage. These problems can be avoided by chemical modification of <b>starch.</b> <b>Starch</b> <b>esters</b> are the most promising material to reach properties which are comparable to PP and PE. This presentation will show a comparison of different possibilities to synthesize thermoplastic <b>starch</b> <b>esters</b> and will show the effect of the synthesis pathway on the mechanical properties of <b>starch</b> <b>esters.</b> Further on a novel and simple as well a fast synthesis pathway of <b>starch</b> mixed <b>esters</b> will be described.

However, in its native form it is highly hydrophilic, not cold-water dispersible and only forms brittle films. So, our work aimed at the chemical modification of degraded starch for the application in the coating sector as binder, with the focus on paints and varnishes. For this purpose, cold-water dispersible hydrophobized <b>starch</b> <b>esters</b> and ethers with high solid contents (≥ 30 % (w/w)) and viscosities between 100 and 1000 mPa•s should be synthesized. Additionally, they should form continuous films and show adhesion to different substrates. As starting product a degraded potato starch with a molar mass of 1. 18 • 105 g/mol was used and modified by carboxylic acid anhydrides (C 2 -C 4) and carboxylic acid vinylesters (C 6) {{in the case of the}} esters. Epoxy alkane derivatives were used for the synthesis of hydroxyalkyl starch ethers (C 3 -C 4, C 6). Beside the type of substituent and the chain length, also the degrees of substitution (DS) and molar substitutions (MS) were varied from 0. 05 to 1. 1. The modification led to cold water-soluble or dispersible products with applicable concentrations between 30 and 45 % (w/w) and viscosities in the range of 102 - 103 mPa•s (100 s - 1). The most samples had a newtonian flow behaviour and showed viscoelastic properties with higher values for the loss modulus (G’’). Continuous films were observed with <b>starch</b> <b>esters</b> in the DS range of 0. 11 - 0. 81 and in the case of the starch ethers with MS values of 0. 77 - 0. 91.

Especially synthetic polymers rely on this feedstock and are indispensible for mankind’s technological advances and status quo. However, a shift to renewable and sustainable resources is needed, {{as the end of the}} fossil fuel era is in sight. Biomass presents one possible alternative to fossil fuels, as it consists of a large pool of different chemicals and is inexhaustible. Cellulose, and the closely related starch and amylose, are available cheaply from plants and have favourable properties, such as high strength, thermal stability and biodegradability. However, such poly(saccharides) have been difficult to use directly as materials because of the lack of thermoplasticity, low solubility and high hydrophilicity. Modifications are thus necessary to be able to exploit their advantageous properties. Recently, our group published the catalytic transesterification of maize starch with different plant oils to obtain fully renewable fatty acid <b>starch</b> <b>esters</b> in a sustainable fashion. Polymeric materials with glass transition temperatures (Tgs), soluble in common organic solvents and an increased hydrophobicity were obtained.

In this study, two synthesis methods were compared {{in terms of their}} efficiency, toxicity and, especially, product solubility with starch laurate (C 12) as model compound. Laurates (DS&# 62; 2) were obtained through transesterification of fatty acid vinylesters in DMSO or reaction with fatty acid chlorides in pyridine. The latter lead to higher DS-values in a shorter reaction time. But due to the much better solubility of the products compared to lauroyl chloride esterified ones, vinylester-transesterification was preferred to optimize reaction parameters, where reaction time could be shortened to 2 h. FASEs C 6 -C 18 were also successfully prepared via transesterification. To determine the DS of the resulting starch laurates, the efficient ATR-IR method was compared with common methods (elementary analysis, 1 H NMR). Molar masses (Mw) of the highly soluble starch laurates were analyzed using SEC-MALLS (THF). High recovery rates (&# 62; 80 %) attest to the outstanding solubility of products obtained through transesterification, caused by a slight disintegration during synthesis.

Casted films of products {{with a degree of}} substitution (DS) of 1. 40 - 1. 73 were compared with highly substituted ones (DS 2. 20 - 2. 63). All films were free of any plasticizer additives. Hydrophobic surfaces were characterized by contact angle measurements. Dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) revealed thermal transitions (T-g, T-m) which were influenced by the internal plasticizing effect of the ester groups. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements showed the increased thermal stability toward native starch. Tensile tests revealed the decreasing strength and stiffness of the products with increasing ester-group chain length while the elongation increased up to the ester group laurate and after that decreased. Esters of the longest fatty acids, palmitate and stearate turned out to be brittle materials due to super molecular structures of the ester chains such as confirmed by X-ray. Summarized products with a DS 1. 40 - 1. 73 featured more "starch-like" properties with tensile strength up to outstanding 43 MPa, while products with a DS > 2 behaved more "oil-like".

Physical properties of the extrudates such as unit and solid density, specific mechanical energy, water absorption and water solubility indices, as well as molecular degradation and DS of the starch, were measured.

Lower molecular weights and higher levels of anhydride resulted in the greatest reduction in starch molecular weight. ^ Modified starches also were produced in a batch process and then extruded. Starch acetate with degrees of substitution of 2 and 3 were extruded with either water or ethanol in a single screw extruder.

While the original fiber production in Teltow-Seehof was based on the viscose process, which is still the dominating process for producing man-made cellulose fibers, alternative ecologically friendly procedures have been developed {{in the course of the}} years. One of these developments concerns the so called CarbaCell process, whereby the chemical modification of cellulose with urea (instead of carbon disulphide in the viscose process) leads to cellulose carbamate, which can be spun and regenerated. Another alternative is the direct solution procedure in N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide monohydrate (NMMNO*H 2 O). This non-derivatizing solvent for cellulose can also be used for several homogeneous chemical reactions, whereby in comparison with the classical heterogeneous slurry processes, a completely different distribution of substituents in the anhydroglucose unit and also along the polymer chain is achieved. The substitution pattern has a high influence on the properties of the products, especially on the solution behavior. Also, anorganic cellulose esters like phosphates and sulfates can be synthesized regioselectively at positions C 6 or C 2 /C 3. Especially the cellulose sulfate with substitutions at position C 6 is a suitable material for the micro-encapsulation of living cells for clinical applications. Slightly substituted cellulose derivatives are also the starting point for the formation of nanocellulose, which is prepared as a clear and opalescent dispersion after a mechanical treatment.

While there has been success in creating mussel-mimetic synthetic polymers, less effort {{has been given to}} create a renewable, green, biocompatible counterpart. This thesis explores the possibilities of starch-based mussel-mimetic adhesives. Carboxymethyl starch of various molecular weights and degree of substitution was synthesized and subsequent conjugation of dopamine to these polymers by 1 -Ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide was investigated. The polymers suffered from very low substitution (DScatechol 3 ̆c 0. 02) and easily precipitated from solution as an insoluble product. The cause of precipitation was investigated and was shown to be unrelated to autooxidation of conjugated dopamine by O 2 and pH. Instead, EDC seemed to be somehow responsible for the precipitation and most likely also for the very low DScatechol due to competing reactions and instability of EDC intermediates. Lap-shear strengths of the CMS-dopamine conjugates failed to exceed those of unmodified CMS. In search of another path to starch-catechol conjugates with higher DScatechol, 1, 12 ̆ 7 -carbonyldiimidazole was employed for direct conjugation of bis-O-protected 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid to unmodified starch. High DS was achieved with 3, 4 -dimethoxybenzoic acid, but demethylation techniques were incompatible with <b>starch</b> and its <b>esters.</b> Phenylboronic acid was then employed as an easily removable diol protecting group for DHBA, but the complex was apparently not stable enough in solution for selective activation of the carboxylic acid group of PBA-DHBA by either CDI or TosCl. Further screening of different protecting groups or a new coupling chemistry is needed to fully assess the possibilities of starch-catechol conjugates of high DScatechol. ...|$|R
40|$|Starch is a {{well-known}} candidate material for replacement of petroleum-derived synthetic polymers to decrease environmental pollution due to its low cost, availability, and total degradability after usage. However, weak water-resistance and poor mechanical properties and dimensional stability limit its wide application. High degree of substitution (DS) starch acetate and starch acetate-maleate are alternatives. ^ During acetylation, DS increased with longer reaction times and higher ratios of acetic anhydride to starch. Reaction efficiency increased with longer reaction times, and decreased with increases in the ratio of acetic anhydride to starch. After acetylation, and as DS increased, the crystalline structures and granule structures of native starch disappeared, while thermal stability increased. ^ Foams were prepared by extruding starch acetate with different DS values using water or ethanol as the blowing agent. Physical and mechanical properties, morphology, and water absorption of the foams depended {{on the type of}} blowing agent and DS. When extruded with water, the extrudates had dense cells with thick cell walls. Radial expansion ratio and spring index decreased, while unit density and compressibility increased with increasing DS. Contrary results were obtained with ethanol as the blowing agent. Tg and the thermal stability of foams increased with extrusion. The rate of biodegradation of the foams decreased with increasing DS. ^ Mixing with other biopolymers or preparation of starch acetate nanocomposites are two methods to improve functional properties of starch acetate foam. Good compatibility and functional properties of starch acetate/poly (tetramethylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (EBC) composite foams were observed with addition of a small amount of EBC. Higher amounts of EBC in the blends decreased the miscibility of these two polymers. ^ Starch acetate nanocomposite foams were successfully prepared by melt-intercalation with four nano sized organoclays with different polarities. Thermal behavior and mechanical properties increased with the addition of organoclay. ^ For <b>starch</b> acetate-maleate mixed <b>esters,</b> the characteristic peaks in 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, and FTIR spectra indicated the presence of acetyl and maleate groups on starch molecules. ...|$|R
