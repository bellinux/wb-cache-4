The central temple of this complex, called the Thakurdwara, has extensive well crafted carvings. This shrine facing east has idols of Ram, Lakshman and Sita (made of black-stone).|$|E
5|$|Much more ancient {{than the}} {{upstream}} mountains are the exotic terranes of the Klamath Mountains to the west. Not until plate tectonics separated North America from Europe and North Africa {{and pushed it}} westward did the continent acquire, bit by bit, what became the Pacific Northwest, including Oregon. The Klamath Mountains consist of multiple terranes—former volcanic islands and coral reefs and bits of subduction zones, mantle, and seafloor—that merged offshore over vast stretches of time before colliding with North America as a <b>single</b> <b>block</b> about 150 to 130million years ago. Much of the Rogue River watershed, including the Rogue River canyon, the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, the Illinois River basin, and Mount Ashland, are composed of exotic terranes.|$|E
5|$|The Baroque wooden reredos of 1679, {{probably}} by local man Thomas Sabin, {{has been compared}} favourably {{with the work of}} Christopher Wren and Grinling Gibbons, and the metal screen also made by an Ashby craftsman, John Staley, is also of high quality. There is a Royal Arms from the reign of CharlesII high on the west wall of the nave. The alabaster pulpit and octagonal font were made by Earp in 1878–1880. The font is carved from a <b>single</b> <b>block</b> of stone and decorated on each face with Christian symbols, and rests on red granite pillars on a Portland stone base. The pulpit is similarly supported to match the font. A second, smaller font with a panelled stem is in the southwestern corner of the nave.|$|E

5|$|The sanctum sanctorium or garbhagriha is {{approached}} from the mandapa through an antaraalayam or inner chamber, which is adorned with sculptures. In the garbhagriha, the central icon of Rama {{along with his}} consort Sita and Lakshmana are carved as a composite image, out of a single rock. It is also inferred that the garbhagriha is itself carved out of a <b>single</b> <b>block.</b> The monkey-god Hanuman, Rama's devotee, who is generally shown with the trio is missing here. However, there is a separate temple for Hanuman here. There is also an image of Ganesha in a dancing posture in the mandapam.|$|E
5|$|While NY426 leaves NY430 {{to follow}} {{the eastern edge of}} the lake southward toward French Creek, NY430 {{continues}} to the northeast, passing through the hamlet of Mina and over the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86 and NY17) on its way to the town of Sherman and the village of the same name. Within the village of Sherman, NY430 becomes Main Street and intersects NY76 west of the village center. The two routes overlap for a <b>single</b> <b>block</b> before separating at the heart of the village, with NY76 continuing southward to an interchange with the Southern Tier Expressway just outside the village and, farther south, to its southern terminus at NY474 in Clymer. NY430, however, exits Sherman to the east before turning northward to parallel an old railroad bed northward into the town of Chautauqua.|$|E
5|$|Work on the {{foundations}} for the lighthouse continued until 30 September. A total of 296 charges were used to remove 2,000tons of rock and Stevenson believed that the rock was so hard that the effort involved was four times that required for boring Aberdeenshire granite. The work went well {{but by the end}} of the second season, no blocks had yet been laid. However, between April 1839 and June 1840 4,300 blocks had been fashioned, the stone donated by the Duke of Argyll from quarries on Mull. The roughly hewn rock was taken to Hynish where the blocks were hammered and chiselled into shape. The largest weighed over 2.5tons, the smallest 0.75tons and the precision required meant that a <b>single</b> <b>block</b> could take 320 man hours to complete.|$|E

5|$|During the Hellenistic period, the {{sanctuary}} was {{extended from the}} base of the podium across the valley. To the east base of the podium stands a large chapel, , dating to the 4thcentury BC. The chapel was adorned with a paved pool and a large stone throne carved of a <b>single</b> <b>block</b> of granite in the Egyptian style; it is flanked by two sphinx figures and surrounded by two lion sculptures. The throne, attributed to the Sidonian goddess Astarte, rests against the chapel wall, which is embellished by relief sculptures of hunting scenes. The once important Astarte basin lost its function during the 2nd century AD and was filled with earth and statue fragments. The west base contains another 4th century BC chapel—centered on a bull protome topped capital—that remains preserved at the National Museum of Beirut.|$|E
5|$|Lazzell {{returned}} to Provincetown {{the following summer}} and requested that painting instructor, Oliver Chaffee, teach her the white-line woodcut technique innovated by B.J.O. Nordfeldt and adopted {{by a group of}} artists who had spent the previous winter in Provincetown. The white-line woodcuts were inspired by Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, but only used a <b>single</b> <b>block</b> of wood. Designs were etched into the surface of woodblocks, with the incised lines separating sections of the blocks. The sections were individually painted and printed onto paper with the carved portions forming white lines. Lazzell and other artists specializing in the white-line technique formed the Provincetown Printers, an artist collective that later would earn national recognition. Toward the close of 1916 she traveled to Manhattan where she studied with Homer Boss and did an analysis of color with William E. Schumacher. Two of her pieces in the white-line style were exhibited in the Provincetown Art Association's annual show in 1917.|$|E
5|$|The Chetco River {{flows through}} the ancient Klamath Mountain terrane, which is between 400 and 100million years old, the oldest rocks in Oregon. The Klamath {{microcontinent}} was originally located beneath the ocean near southern California before separating {{hundreds of millions of}} years ago. Plate tectonics pushed the microcontinent north, and bits of granite, sea floor sediment, subduction zones, and coral reefs gradually accreted into small islands. Between 212 and 170million years ago, a massive volcanic arc erupted on the Klamath microcontinent, binding the islands together in a <b>single</b> <b>block.</b> The Klamath microcontinent went through a period of intense tectonic activity known as the Siskiyou orogeny roughly 170 to 165million years ago. The process was strong enough to force sedimentary rocks deep into the Earth's crust, melting them into large plutons of granite, which rose slowly to the surface. Shortly after, a large portion of sea floor was thrust over the older Klamath terranes; much of it is still visible atop Vulcan and Chetco peaks. This region is known as the Josephine Ophiolite, and contains a rare type of rock called peridotite, originating from the Earth's mantle.|$|E

5|$|The neotype {{skeleton}} {{had been}} uncovered in the Black Ven Marl or Woodstone Nodule Bed, marine deposits of the Charmouth Mudstone Formation, {{dating from the}} late Sinemurian stage, about 191 million years ago. It consists of a rather complete skeleton with skull and lower jaws. Only the snout tip, the neck base, the forelimbs and the tail end are missing. Hundreds of osteoderms were found {{in connection with the}} skeleton, many more or less in their original position. From the 1960s onward, this fossil was further prepared by Ronald Croucher using acid baths to free the bones from the surrounding matrix, a method perfected for the Charmouth fossils. In 1992, Charig reported that only a <b>single</b> <b>block</b> had yet to be treated, but he died before the results could be published. Norman, who intends to complete this task, has revealed some new anatomical details in 2004. Apart from these, a modern description is largely lacking.|$|E
5|$|Sicilian church exteriors {{had been}} {{decorated}} in elaborate styles {{from the first}} quarter of the 17th century, with profuse use of sculpture, stucco, frescoes, and marble (Illustration 14). As the post-earthquake churches were becoming completed in the late 1720s, interiors also began to reflect this external decoration, becoming lighter and less intense (compare illustration 14 to the later interior of illustration 15), with profuse sculpted ornamentation of pillars, cornices, and pediments, often in the form of putti, flora, and fauna. Inlaid coloured marbles on floors and walls in complex patterns are one of the most defining features of the style. These patterns with their roundels of porphyry are often derived from designs found in the Norman cathedrals of Europe, again demonstrating the Norman origins of Sicilian architecture. The high altar is usually the pièce de resistance: in many instances a <b>single</b> <b>block</b> of coloured marble, decorated with gilt scrolls and swags, and frequently inset with other stones such as lapis lazuli and agate. Steps leading to the altar dais are characteristically curving between concave and convex and in many cases decorated with inlaid coloured marbles. One of the finest examples of this is in the church of St Zita in Palermo.|$|E
