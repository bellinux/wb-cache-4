5|$|Fruit body {{primordia}} first appear {{between the}} scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from the <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth outward from the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48–72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances {{on the part of}} the stem adjoining the undersurface of the cap. As the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.|$|E

500|$|The long-stemmed, blackish-brown or blackish-purple, barely {{translucent}} sporangia of Barbeyella are spherical, 0.15 to 0.2mm {{in diameter}} and together with the stem measure 0.3 to 0.7mm long. They are usually scattered on the substrate, but also often grouped in loose, large colonies. The hypothallus (the tissue upon which the sporangiophore rests) [...] has a diameter of at least 0.7mm. Although not visible on mosses, it has a reddish-brown color when growing on wood. The brownish-black stem is up to 0.1mm thick, thinning to 5µm towards the top and is filled with protoplasmatic scrap material. The columella – arising from the <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> – matures at the upper end at roughly half {{the height of the}} sporangiophore into 7 to 13 simple or occasionally bifurcated, 1 to 4µm large, dark-brown capillitium strands. Usually individual, occasionally in pairs, these are firmly fused with the lobed segments of the peridium, which are round in cross-section. When the spores mature, the sporangium splits and empties into the peridium towards the base. This prevents the lobes of the peridium from detaching and provides spore dispersal over a longer period, similar to a dehiscing capsule.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) stem {{development}} significantly affects grain yield. The dwarf plants (D) {{of wheat}} mutant dms {{was less than}} 30 cm. Here, we were to explore the molecular basis for the restrained stem development of the dwarf plants. The results were reached by compare the young spikes and stems transcriptomes of the tall (T) and D plants of mutant dms. We identified 663 genes highly expressed in <b>stem</b> <b>tips.</b> We identified 997 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in <b>stem</b> <b>tips</b> between T and D, 403 DEGs were significantly related with stem development. Most biological processes in <b>stem</b> <b>tips</b> on dwarf plants were significantly suppressed, such as phytohormone signaling etc. The sequencing analysis results were confirmed by quantitatively analysis the expression profiles of fourteen key DEGs via real-time QRT-PCR. We identified a group genes related to wheat stem development, identified a group DEGs related to the restrained stem development of D plants of dms. The suppressed phytohormone signaling, carbohydrate transport and metabolism were the major causal factors leading to dwarf plants of D.

50|$|Senecio rowleyanus is {{commonly}} cultivated as an ornamental plant. It is typically displayed in hanging baskets with the leaves cascading {{over the edge}} of the container. It can be grown indoors or outdoors (above freezing temperature) and is considered to be low maintenance. Like most succulents, it requires very infrequent watering (about once a month), a few hours of direct sunlight and is not affected by humidity. Good soil drainage is essential to prevent root rot, so sandy soil is recommended (cactus mix or 3:1 potting soil to sharp sand). This plant can be easily propagated by cutting or pinching off 4 inches of healthy <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> and lightly covering them with moist potting mix. The roots will quickly develop from where the leaves are attached to the stem.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} of the {{transition}} is {{the transformation of the}} vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of {{the central part of the}} <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue. Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower.|$|E

50|$|Phototropism {{in plants}} such as Arabidopsis thaliana is {{directed}} by blue light receptors called phototropins. Other photosensitive receptors in plants include phytochromes that sense red light and cryptochromes that sense blue light. Different organs of the plant may exhibit different phototropic reactions to different wavelengths of light. <b>Stem</b> <b>tips</b> exhibit positive phototropic reactions to blue light, while root tips exhibit negative phototropic reactions to blue light. Both root <b>tips</b> and most <b>stem</b> <b>tips</b> exhibit positive phototropism to red light.Cryptochromes are photoreceptors that absorb blue/ UV-A light, and they help control the circadian rhythm in plants and timing of flowering. Phytochromes are photoreceptors that sense red/far-red light, but they also absorb blue light. The combination of responses from phytochromes and cryptochromes allow the plant to respond to various kinds of light. Together phytochromes and cryptochromes inhibit gravitropism in hypocotyls and contribute to phototropism.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The stem design, {{geometry}} and material change the mechanical behavior of bone around tibia tray and stem after TKA. In this study a shape optimization of a cemented tibia stem {{has been carried}} out to solve the stress shielding at the proximal tibia as well as the stress concentration at the <b>stem</b> <b>tip.</b> It is found that the optimal shape is a short stem with small diameter at the distal <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> increased gradually to reach a maximum value at the proximal tibia stem. This optimal shape is increased von Mises stress at the lateral and medial cancellous bone by 130 % and 140 %, respectively compared to initial stem shape. On the other hand the stress concentration in bone at <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> using the optimal stem shape is reduced by 25 % compared to initial shape. However, the optimal stem shape is reduced the stresses in cement at <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> by 28 % laterally and 17 % medially compared to the initial stem shape.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the migration pattern of the Lubinus SP II prosthesis stem. Migration at the stem-cement and at the bone-cement interface was assessed.
