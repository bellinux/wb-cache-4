5|$|The FCI {{refused to}} suspend Petacchi, and he {{returned}} to racing in late July. Their decision, however, was not made to exonerate Petacchi, but rather {{because they did not}} believe they <b>should</b> <b>hear</b> the case, instead deferring to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The CAS heard the case, and Petacchi testified to the court, stating that the hot and humid day on which the stage was the run had made it so that he took several extra puffs from his inhaler, but that this was accidental and that most had come after he had already crossed the finish line and won the stage.|$|E

25|$|The first hearing at Erzurum Heavy Penal Court 2 {{was held}} on 4 May 2010. At the time 10 of the 16 {{defendants}} were in pre-trial detention.

On 18 May 2010 Penal Chamber 11 at the Court of Cassation heard the case and decided to release all 10 defendants. Since Istanbul Heavy Penal Court 13 also had demanded {{to take over the}} case the Assembly of Chamber at the Court of Cassation {{had to deal with the}} case. On 24 December 2010, the Assembly decided that the case related to misuse of authority should continue at Penal Chamber 11 at the Court of Cassation, but the Erzincan file should be sent back to the prosecutor in Erzurum, because he had initiated a case against a first-degree prosecutor without permission of the Ministry of Justice.|$|E

So Themistocles told Aristides that his purpose was to burn the naval station of the confederate Hellenes, for that in this way the Athenians would be greatest, and lords of all.

One of her students, Brittany Swartzentruber, said that Falle's lectures would {{have a significant impact on}} Swartzentruber's career as a police officer, saying, [...] "She was one of the best speakers I have ever heard." [...] Falle partners with the Toronto Police Service's sex crimes unit, which developed the statistic that the average age for a girl to become involved in prostitution in Canada is 14.

500|$|... "Material Girl" [...] {{consists}} of synth arrangements, {{with a strong}} backbeat supporting it. A robotic male voice repeats the hook [...] "Living in a material world". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, the song {{is set in the}} time signature of common time, with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is set in the key of C major, with Madonna's voice spanning from the tonal nodes of C4 to C5. The song has a basic chord progression of F–G–Em–Am-F-G-C in the chorus, while the verses are based on the C mixolydian mode, giving a hip, swing-like mood. The bassline in the song with the post-disco origins is reminiscent of The Jacksons' [...] "Can You Feel It", which appeared on their 1980 album Triumph. Furthermore, the strophes remind of the refrain from Melissa Manchester's hit [...] "You <b>Should</b> <b>Hear</b> How She Talks About You" [...] (1982).|$|E
500|$|The {{next step}} for the Frank team was {{to appeal the}} issue through the federal system. The {{original}} request for a writ of error on the absence of Frank from the jury's announcement of the verdict was first denied by Justice Joseph Rucker Lamar and then Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. Both denied the request because they agreed with the Georgia court that the issue was raised too late. The full Supreme Court then heard arguments, but denied the motion without issuing a written decision. However, Holmes said, [...] "I very seriously doubt if the petitioner... has had due process of law... because of the trial {{taking place in the}} presence of a hostile demonstration and seemingly dangerous crowd, thought by the presiding Judge to be ready for violence unless a verdict of guilty was rendered." [...] Holmes' statement, as well as public indignation over this latest rejection by the courts, encouraged Frank's team to attempt a habeas corpus motion, arguing that the threat of crowd violence had forced Frank to be absent from the verdict hearing and constituted a violation of due process. Justice Lamar heard the motion and agreed that the full Supreme Court <b>should</b> <b>hear</b> the appeal.|$|E

2500|$|Palin {{answered}} a 2006 gubernatorial questionnaire by choosing support for funding of abstinence-before-marriage programs over support for [...] "explicit sex-education programs, school-based clinics {{and the distribution}} of contraceptives in schools". In a subsequent radio interview with KTOO (FM) in Juneau, Alaska, she clarified her position by saying she was against explicit sex education, but was in favor of contraceptive education. She characterized in-school discussion of condoms as [...] "relatively benign" [...] and not something that would define an [...] "explicit" [...] program. Palin said of contraception that [...] "kids who may not hear about it at home <b>should</b> <b>hear</b> about it in other avenues." [...] Rebecca Traister of Salon.com analyzed Palin's political record as one that demonstrated her lack of enthusiasm about the Bush era promotion of abstinence-before-marriage education, and one that showed she did not work against existing sex education laws in Alaska.|$|E
2500|$|Early in the {{recording}} process, Kerrang! reported that the band's new album would be released sometime in 2010. Towards the end of {{the recording}} process, Gaskarth said the album would be released in January 2011. On August 17, a demo was posted online of the track [...] "Actors". Gaskarth said he posted it because he [...] "thought people <b>should</b> <b>hear</b> it." [...] He said that the song wouldn't fit on Dirty Work since it [...] "didn't represent the theme of the new album closely enough." [...] After appearing at Reading and Leeds Festivals in August, the band returned to the studio to finalise the album's track listing in September. In October and November, the band went on a headlining club tour in the US with support from A Rocket to the Moon and City (Comma) State. The band held a contest where five fans could hear the new album at each stop on the tour. On October 18, the album's title as revealed: Dirty Work. In November, Barakat revealed that the album's release date had been pushed back to early spring and {{that the majority of the}} album's songs were mixed. In December, [...] "Merry Christmas, Kiss My Ass" [...] was made available for streaming. In January 2011, Gaskarth said the group were sorting out the track order and working on the album's artwork. He also said that the album was originally going to be released in the same month, [...] "but now it looks like we’re going to have to push it back" [...] and were aiming for its release between January and March.

2500|$|Rav Kruspedai said in {{the name}} of Rabbi Johanan that on Rosh Hashanah, three books are opened in Heaven — one for the {{thoroughly}} wicked, one for the thoroughly righteous, and one for those in between. The thoroughly righteous are immediately inscribed definitively in the book of life. The thoroughly wicked are immediately inscribed definitively in the book of death. And the fate of those in between is suspended from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur. If they deserve well, then they are inscribed in the book of life; if they do not deserve well, then they are inscribed in the book of death. Rabbi Abin said that [...] tells us this when it says, [...] "Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous." [...] "Let them be blotted out from the book" [...] refers to the book of the wicked. [...] "Of the living" [...] refers to the book of the righteous. [...] "And not be written with the righteous" [...] refers to the book of those in between. Rav Nahman bar Isaac derived this from [...] where Moses told God, [...] "if not, blot me, I pray, out of Your book that You have written." [...] "Blot me, I pray" [...] refers to the book of the wicked. [...] "Out of Your book" [...] refers to the book of the righteous. [...] "That you have written" [...] refers to the book of those in between. It was taught in a Baraita that the House of Shammai said that there will be three groups at the Day of Judgment — one of thoroughly righteous, one of thoroughly wicked, and one of those in between. The thoroughly righteous will immediately be inscribed definitively as entitled to everlasting life; the thoroughly wicked will immediately be inscribed definitively as doomed to Gehinnom, as [...] says, [...] "And many of them who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life and some to reproaches and everlasting abhorrence." [...] Those in between will go down to Gehinnom and scream and rise again, as [...] says, [...] "And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on My name and I will answer them." [...] Of them, Hannah said in 1 Samuel [...] "The Lord kills and makes alive, He brings down to the grave and brings up." [...] The House of Hillel, however, taught that God inclines the scales towards grace (so that those in between do not have to descend to Gehinnom), and of them David said in [...] "I love that the Lord <b>should</b> <b>hear</b> my voice and my supplication [...] [...] [...] The cords of death compassed me, and the straits of the netherworld got hold upon me," [...] and on their behalf David composed the conclusion of [...] "I was brought low and He saved me."–17a1.|$|E
