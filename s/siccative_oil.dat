The chromatogram also showed the presence of characteristic markers of a drying oil, with large amount of palmitic, oleic and stearic acids (Figure  2). In order to confirm {{the presence of a}} <b>siccative</b> <b>oil,</b> GC/MS analyses after saponification, extraction and derivatisation with a silanising agent, were performed. The results can be seen in Table  1, and the chromatogram of sample L 12 is shown in Figure  3. The GC/MS analysis shows the presence of all the main fatty acids characteristic of an aged oil, such as suberic, azelaic and sebacic acids, and also common dicarboxylic acids deriving from the drying process of a <b>siccative</b> <b>oil</b> [7].|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{chemical}} characterisation of samples of black decorations and inscriptions, and of yellow-brown patinas collected from various panels of the chapel of Saint Anthony (Padua, Italy) ark, by using three analytical procedures based on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). In particular, analytical pyrolysis {{in the presence of}} hexamethyldisilazane followed by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis (Py-GC/MS) and two procedures based on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry after wet-chemical treatment of the samples (GC/MS) have been chosen for the recognition of the organic substances (used originally or in the course of restoration) and of their degradation products. As far as the two GC/MS procedures are concerned, one is suitable for the characterisation of proteins, lipids, resins, waxes, bituminous materials and their degradation products, and the other was used to characterise the saccharide materials. The three analytical procedures used allow us to obtain information on the presence of egg proteins, lipid materials (beeswax, <b>siccative</b> <b>oil</b> and animal fatty material), saccharide materials and Pinaceae resin. Beeswax, animal fat, egg and saccharide materials have been used as past restoration materials, and pine resin and <b>siccative</b> <b>oil</b> are the main ingredients of the black decorations and inscriptions...|$|E
30|$|In the {{chromatogram}} {{of samples}} 3 and 4, {{the presence of}} dehydroabietic and 7 -oxo-dehydroabietic acid, associated to colophony resin, was also identified [29, 33, 34]. This resin is less abundant than the <b>siccative</b> <b>oil,</b> and could be associated {{to the use of}} a varnish in the past. However, it cannot be excluded the possibility that colophony resin could {{have been added to the}} animal glue, as used traditionally in the preparation of the colla-pasta for the relining of the canvas.|$|E

30|$|The results {{obtained}} {{enabled us to}} affirm that Gallizio in this work used traditional organic pigments, such as ultramarine blue, lithopone, and carbon black, as well as modern organic ones, such as monoazo PY 3 yellow pigment, PR 3 monoazo red pigment, and phthalocyanine blue PB 15. Pigments were applied by the artist using a PVAc binder on the canvases of the ceiling, while <b>siccative</b> <b>oils</b> and PVAc {{were found on the}} canvas of the wall. Wires, sand and traces of gunpowder were also observed, thus confirming Gallizio’s use of unconventional artists’ materials.|$|R
30|$|Pigments and {{unconventional}} materials (such as metal wires, sand) {{are present}} in the canvases that form the ceiling. The colours are unevenly distributed on the surface, thus revealing large areas of the white preparation below. In the canvas of the wall, instead, the paint is applied more uniformly and gives a dark colour cast. The analytical results led to the identification of many of the materials used by Gallizio. The pictorial palette consists of both inorganic and organic pigments, while polyvinylacetate, pure or mixed with a <b>siccative</b> <b>oil,</b> was identified as a binder thus confirming what was reported by the artist in his notes.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first systematic {{analysis of the}} palette of Francesco Hayez, {{one of the most}} outstanding artists of European Romanticism, whose painting technique has never been extensively investigated despite the plethora of artistic studies. He lived in a particular moment in the history of painting, as {{in the first half of}} the 19 th century many synthetic pigments were available, also in tin tubes, but traditional materials were still used. Sixteen paintings on canvas and on panels, created between 1823 and 1868, were analyzed in situ through non-invasive techniques (infrared reflectography and infrared reflection spectroscopy). Imaging investigation provided clues on painting technique, revealing some cases of pentimenti and underdrawings. A preliminary survey was carried out on a hundred pure pigments used up to the 19 th century and on new synthetic colours, in order to attain reference spectra for the interpretation of painting spectra. The portable infrared instrument provided insight into Hayez's painting materials, identifying barite, ivory black, lead-tin yellow, Naples yellow, ochres, Prussian blue, and white lead. The pigments were often blended, to obtain a unique fabric appearance or to attain cold shades. The results pointed to a <b>siccative</b> <b>oil</b> as a binder, mixed with white lead so that it could act as a catalyzer in polymerization reactions, and in some cases with a proteinaceous binder and resins. The preparation was made with gypsum and white lead mixed with a <b>siccative</b> <b>oil.</b> The results showed that the artist used a typical traditional palette, throughout his career, in order to lead to brilliant colours and with long-term stability. Anyway, the possible presence of cobalt blue in a few paintings suggests that Hayez had probably started testing the new colours, since the second decade of 19 th century...|$|E
30|$|The monocarboxylic acids {{are related}} to the oil {{modification}} and suberic and azealic acid are common oxidation products of a <b>siccative</b> <b>oil</b> [11, 15]. Based on the relative peak heights of ortho-phthalic acid and of the fatty acids the oil length of the alkyd resin {{is likely to be a}} medium type [16]. The rosin compounds identified were dehydroabietic acid (DHA), 7 -oxo DHA, and 7 -methoxy-tetradehydroabietic acid which are oxidation products of abietic acid and markers for resin of the Pine tree family (Pinaceae) [17 – 20]. The presence rosin may indicate that oil modification was performed with tall oil fatty acids (TOFA), a by-product from the paper industry which finds major use in alkyds [2, 15]. However, a direct addition of rosin to the oil modified alkyd or pigment modification can not be excluded.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{oil paints}} require an oil that always hardens, forming a stable, {{impermeable}} film. Such <b>oils</b> are called <b>siccative,</b> or drying, <b>oils,</b> and {{are characterized by}} high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. One common measure of the <b>siccative</b> property of <b>oils</b> is iodine number, the number of grams of iodine one hundred grams of oil can absorb. Oils with an iodine number greater than 130 are considered drying, those with an iodine number of 115-130 are semi-drying, and those with an iodine number of less than 115 are non-drying. Linseed oil, the most prevalent vehicle for artists' oil paints, is a drying oil.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the time}} of the Renaissance, <b>siccative</b> (drying) <b>oil</b> paints, {{primarily}} linseed oil, have been the most commonly used kind of paints in fine art applications; oil paint is still common today. However, in the 20th century, water-based paints, including watercolors and acrylic paints, became very popular with the development of acrylic and other latex paints. Milk paints (also called casein), where the medium is derived from the natural emulsion that is milk, were popular in the 19th century and are still available today. Egg tempera (where the medium is an emulsion of raw egg yolk mixed with oil) is still in use as well, as are encaustic wax-based paints. Gouache is a variety of opaque watercolor that was also used in the Middle Ages and Renaissance for manuscript illuminations. The pigment was often made from ground semiprecious stones such as lapis lazuli and the binder made from either gum arabic or egg white. Gouache, also known as 'designer color' or 'body color' is commercially available today.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this work}} was to study the Altar Machine in the Church Mother of Gangi, a little town near Palermo (Italy) {{regarding}} the history, the technical manufacture, the constitutive materials {{and the state of}} preservation. The Altar Machine was dated back to {{the second half of the}} 18 th century; it is constituted by carved and painted wood, a complex system of winch and pulleys allows move various statues and parts of the Machine in accordance with the baroque scenography machineries. Results The observation and survey of the mechanisms allowed formulate hypothesis on a more ancient mode of operation of the Altar Machine. Laboratory analysis revealed the presence of many superimposed layers constituted by several different materials (protein binders, <b>siccative</b> <b>oils,</b> natural terpene resins, shellac, calcium carbonate, gypsum, lead white, brass, zinc white, iron oxides) and different wood species employed for the original and restoration elements of the Machine. This is due to a continuous usage of the object that has got a demo-ethno-anthropological significance. Microclimate monitoring (relative humidity RH and temperature T) put in evidence that most of the data fall outside the tolerance intervals, i. e. the RH and T limits defined by the international standards. In particular, T values were generally high (out of the tolerance range) but they appeared to be quite constant; on the other hand RH values fell almost always inside the tolerance area but they often exhibited dangerous variations. Conclusions The characterization of the constitutive materials provided useful information both to support the dating of the Machine proposed by the inscription and to obtain a base of data for a possible conservation work. The microclimate monitoring put in evidence that the temperature and relative humidity values are not always suitable to correctly preserve the artefact. The careful in situ investigation confirmed an on-going climate induced damage to the Altar Machine that, associated to the deterioration caused by its usage, may have dramatic consequences on this unique and peculiar work of art. The results of this work will have potential implications in the near future regarding a probable conservation project on the Machine. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{surface of}} bronze sculptures was often treated by {{applying}} organic translucent substances (patinas), {{in order to}} modify their appearance and to cover melting defects. The aesthetical impact and the chemical composition of patinas on bronze sculptures have been studied in the literature, mainly focussing on inorganic materials and corrosion phenomena. On the other hand, the identification of original and restoration organic materials constituting the patina on a bronze object can yield precious historical and artistic information, and can contribute to plan efficient cleaning and restoring procedures. This paper reports the characterisation of the patinas on two bronze heads belonging to the Cantoria di Donatello in Santa Maria del Fiore currently under restoration at the Opificio delle Pietre Dure (Florence). The samples were collected at different cleaning stages. The samples were subjected to GC/MS analysis to characterise organic materials by identifying the specific biomarkers: a Pinaceae resin, a <b>siccative</b> <b>oil,</b> beeswax and paraffin wax were recognised. The study highlighted meaningful {{differences between the two}} samples, and allowed for understanding the technology employed in the application of patinas on the two bronze heads...|$|E
30|$|The {{organic binder}} {{used in the}} green and white samples was {{investigated}} using Py-GC/MS. The Py-GC/MS analysis (Additional file 5) revealed fatty acids, and dicarboxylic acids in a sample taken from a white painted area, which indicates {{the use of a}} drying oil such as linseed oil. In comparison with a reference sample chromatogram, the use of egg is inferred applied possibly along with the drying oil. The dicarboxylic acids indicated can also originate from the use of egg but an intentional addition of <b>siccative</b> <b>oil</b> cannot be excluded. Pyrolysis products of protein-based binders were not identified thereby ruling out the use of animal glue. The phthalic and benzoic acids detected (Additional file 5) could have originated from the pyrolysis of lignin in plant materials, such as the straw used in the layer after the support. The methane sulphonic acid is derived from the anhydrite/gypsum in the preparatory layer. An identical chromatogram was obtained from a green paint sample used for the binder identification. The possible use of egg as a binder was also supported by the micro-FTIR investigation on a green paint sample.|$|E
30|$|On the verso of page 56 {{it states}} that ‘Lake {{takes a long}} time to dry in oil, and for that reason you have to grind some glass with it. But you have to choose crystallin, because it is cleaner.’ Crystallin at this time would have meant clear {{colourless}} glass containing manganese as a decolorizer to counteract the greenish tint caused by the iron naturally present in the silica source used for ordinary glass. This seems invariably to have been the type of glass used as an additive in paintings, since the quantitative analyses show that in every case some manganese is present [8]. It is well known that manganese can act as a <b>siccative</b> for <b>oil,</b> although it is not yet clear whether this element is sufficiently mobile in the glass to perform this function, and it may be that the alkali content proves to be more important in this respect [8]. In northern European glass manganese is likely to have been introduced as part of the wood ash used as the flux, rather than as a separate component [17].|$|R
40|$|Drying oils, and in {{particular}} linseed oil, were the most common binding media employed in painting between XVI and XIX centuries. Artists usually operated some pre-treatments on the oils to obtain binders with modified properties, such as different handling qualities or colour. Oil processing has a key role on the subsequent ageing of and degradation of linseed oil paints. In this thesis a multi-analytical approach was adopted to investigate the drying, polymerization and oxidative degradation of the linseed oil paints. In particular, thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), yielding information on the macromolecular scale, were compared with gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) and direct exposure mass spectrometry (DEMS) providing information on the molecular scale. The study was performed on linseed oils and paint reconstructions prepared according to an accurate historical description of the painting techniques of the 19 th century. TGA revealed that during ageing the molecular weight of the oils changes and that higher molecular weight fractions formed. TGA {{proved to be an}} excellent tool to compare the oils and paint reconstructions. This technique is able to highlight the different physical behaviour of oils that were processed using different methods and of paint layers {{on the basis of the}} different processed oil and /or the pigment used. GC/MS and DE-MS were used to characterise the soluble and non-polymeric fraction of the oils and paint reconstructions. GC/MS allowed us to calculate the ratios of palmitic to stearic acid (P/S), and azelaic to palmitic acid (A/P) and to evaluate effects produced by oil pre-treatments and the presence of different pigments. This helps to understand the role of the pre-treatments and of the pigments on the oxidative degradation undergone by <b>siccative</b> <b>oils</b> during ageing. DE-MS enabled the various molecular weight fractions of the samples to be simultaneously studied, and thus helped to highlight the presence of oxidation and hydrolysis reactions, and the formation of carboxylates that occur during ageing and with the changing of the oil pre-treatments and the pigments. The combination of thermal analysis with molecular techniques such as GC-MS, DEMS and FTIR enabled a model to be developed, for unravelling some crucial issues: 1) 	how oil pre-treatments produce binders with different physical-chemical qualities, and how this can influence the ageing of an oil paint film; 2) 	which is the role of the interaction between oil and pigments in the ageing and degradation process. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} deals with 20 th century {{manufactured}} artists' oil paints containing raw and burnt umber pigments, this is, natural earth pigments {{resulting from the}} combination of iron and manganese oxides.

This research aims to show the diversity of formulations behind apparently same commercial names as well as to understand how the content of manganese, the presence of modern lipidic media and the hydrolysis mechanisms can promote significant differences in the expected mechanical properties of oil paint films, thus conditioning their long-term performance. Several manufactured artists' oil paint films containing manganese were selected. Dried films from raw and burnt umber oil paints by Winsor&Newton® (UK), Grumbacher® (USA), Gamblin® (USA) and Speedball® (USA) were studied and information about their chemical composition and mechanical behaviour is here presented. In addition to the identification and the study of the inorganic and organic components present in each formulation through LM, SEM-EDX, FTIR-ATR, XRD, GC-MS analysis, tensile tests were run and stress-strain curves were obtained.

30|$|Based on the {{observation}} of Raman bands attributed to degraded organic binders in various of the micro samples (Fig.  3) and considering the hypothesis of a secco painting technique, we selected four samples (PCH 02, PCH 04, PCH 05, and PCH 08) of the mural painting and submitted them to extraction with ammonia, using a modification of the procedure reported in [8] and described in the Experimental section. After separation of the lipid fraction from the proteins, both fractions were derivatised and analyzed by GC–MS. Fatty acids obtained by saponification and further acidification were analyzed as their methyl esters (FAME) while sterols were derivatised as their trimethylsilyl derivatives (TMS). The chromatograms of the four samples showed a major presence of palmitic (C 16 : 0) and stearic (C 18 : 0) acids, together with minor amounts of myristic acid (C 14 : 0) in samples PCH 02 and PCH 05, and oleic acid (C 18 : 1) in samples PCH 04 and PCH 05. Samples PCH 05 and PCH 08 also showed azelaic (nonanedioic) acid, a degradation product of C- 18 polyunsaturated fatty acids in siccative oils such as linseed oil. The ratio between {{the areas of the}} FAME of palmitic and stearic acids (P/S) is a parameter that gives information on the lipid source based on the stability of both saturated fatty acids [59]. Samples PCH 02 and PCH 05 showed P/S ratios of 1.2 while PCH 04 and PCH 08 gave ratios of 0.9 and 1.4, respectively. These values are close to those reported previously for a naturally aged model sample of linseed oil applied on gypsum (1.6) compared to a model sample of whole egg on gypsum (2.8) [4]. Moreover, the ratio of the areas of azelaic and palmitic acids (A/P) is a parameter that helps in the determination of a <b>siccative</b> <b>oil</b> due to the presence of reactive linoleic and linolenic acids in comparison to egg, which is rich in oleic acid [59]. Samples PCH 05 and PCH 08 showed A/P values of 0.1 and 0.2 close to that of a model sample of linseed oil on gypsum (0.1) [4] while azelaic acid was absent in samples PCH 02 and PCH 04. Three of the samples (PCH 02, PCH 05, and PCH 08) showed the presence of cholesterol, which indicates the use of egg as a binder. The identification of a mixture of egg and a <b>siccative</b> <b>oil</b> in samples PCH 05 and PCH 08 points to a tempera grassa [16].|$|E
30|$|The Andean {{church of}} San Andrés de Pachama {{is located in}} the {{highland}} of the northernmost of Chile, near the limit with Bolivia and next to the Ruta de la Plata. This commercial route contributed in the past to the transport and commerce of various raw materials, such as silver, from the Andean mountains region to the Pacific Ocean coast and then to the European market. The walls inside the church are decorated with paintings {{from the end of the}} eighteenth century that reproduce religious motivs together with flowers, fruits, and birds. In this study, micro samples taken from one of the mural paintings have been analysed to acquire information on the artistic materials and the painting technique previous to the restoration of the paintings. Analysis by micro-Raman spectroscopy complemented with scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection allowed the identification of orpiment, vermilion, indigo, smalt, antlerite, hematite, carmine lake, and wood charcoal as pigments as well as gypsum as the ground layer. Lipidic and proteinaceous materials extracted from the microsamples were identified by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and indicated the use of a mixture of egg and <b>siccative</b> <b>oil</b> as binders and a secco painting technique involving animal glue as the plaster primer.

Results The content of oil in hempseed registers a slight decrease in the production records of 2011, losses due to drought {{and low levels of}} precipitation during the growth period. The greatest loss is found in Diana monoecious variety (26. 54 - 20. 82 %) followed by Zenit varieties (27. 37 - 22. 97 %), Armanca (29. 27 - 25. 32 %), Silvana (28. 89 - 25. 04 %) and Denise (26. 96 - 25. 30 %). <b>Siccative</b> hemp <b>oil</b> has a yellowish green color and an iodine index of 140 – 156 g I 2 / 100 g oil. Hemp seed are rich in mineral based Ca (144 – 955 mg/ 100 g seed), Mg (237 – 694 mg/ 100 g seed), K (463 – 2821 mg/ 100 g seed), Fe (1133 - 2400 mg. kg - 1), Mn (63 – 110 mg. kg - 1) and Zn (42 - 94 mg. kg - 1). For the soil the following macroelements concentrations were determined: Ca (2100 – 2520 mg. kg - 1), Mg (320 – 376 mg. kg - 1) and K (232 – 257 mg. kg - 1). Mn (156 – 197 mg. kg - 1) and Zn (54 – 67 mg. kg - 1) remain within normal limits for Romania. The soils in the experience area contain large amounts of Fe (19000 – 20430 mg. kg - 1). The presence of K in large quantities determines the accumulation of large quantities of Fe in the soil. Conclusion Hempseed belonging to the five Romanian varieties are rich source of nutrients (Ca, Mg, K) and unsaturated oil easily digestible by the body, but the presence of Cd concentrations above the upper limit puts a question mark over the use of seeds in various food products. Hemp extracts easily certain metals from the soil. Significant amounts of Fe (1133 – 2400 mg. kg - 1), Mn (63 – 110 mg. kg - 1), Zn (42 – 94 mg. kg - 1) and Cd (1. 3 - 4. 0 mg. kg - 1) are found in hemp seeds.
