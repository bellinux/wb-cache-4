50|$|The {{controlled}} {{part of the}} injector is a solenoid-operated <b>spill</b> <b>valve.</b> Normally, it is open, {{allowing the}} fuel {{to return to the}} supply line when the pump plunger descends. When the solenoid is energized, the <b>spill</b> <b>valve</b> closes, and the fuel is forced through the spray tip into the cylinder.|$|E
50|$|Take the {{possibility}} of increased altitude where there will be reduced air intake pressure. In this case, the chamber within the FCU will expand which causes the <b>spill</b> <b>valve</b> to bleed more fuel. This causes the pump to deliver less fuel until the opposing chamber pressure {{is equivalent to the}} air pressure and the <b>spill</b> <b>valve</b> goes back to its position.|$|E
5000|$|Spill phase: The {{pump plunger}} begins descending, but the <b>spill</b> <b>valve</b> is open, and fuel recirculates {{back to the}} return line.|$|E
50|$|When the {{throttle}} is opened, it releases i.e. lessens the pressure which lets {{the throttle}} valve fall. The pressure is transmitted (because of a back-pressure valve i.e. no air gaps in fuel flow) which closes the FCU <b>spill</b> <b>valves</b> (as they are commonly called) which then increases {{the pressure and}} causes a higher flow rate.|$|R
5000|$|Pressure {{reduction}} phase: Toward {{the end of}} {{the pump}} stroke, the <b>spill</b> <b>valve</b> is re-opened, allowing the fuel to recirculate again and ending the injection phase.|$|E
5000|$|Injection phase: Partway {{through the}} pump stroke, the solenoid is energized, which closes the <b>spill</b> <b>valve.</b> The fuel is {{forced into the}} {{cylinder}} through the spray tip.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine speed}} {{governor}} is used to prevent the engine from over-speeding. It has the capability of disregarding the FCU control. It does this by use of a diaphragm which senses the engine speed {{in terms of the}} centrifugal pressure caused by the rotating rotor of the pump. At a critical value, this diaphragm causes another <b>spill</b> <b>valve</b> to open and bleed away the fuel flow.|$|E
40|$|Identifying and {{addressing}} land uses {{on or near}} airports that attract wildlife hazardous to aviation, such as refuse and water management facilities, {{is an important component}} of an integrated approach to reduce wildlife-aircraft collisions. Similar to most airports, Snohomish County Airport (Paine Field) has recently been involved with construction of on-airfield stormwater management structures. In addition, Snohomish County built a new trash-transfer facility on airport property during 2002 - 2003. The airport, USDA Wildlife Services, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provided considerable input into the design and landscaping around the transfer facility and in the redesign of a stormwater detention pond/wetland to minimize their attractiveness to hazardous wildlife. The number of blackbirds, American crows, and songbirds using the transfer station and site after the facility opened (during 2004) was reduced by 96 %, 7 %, and 63 %, respectively, compared to when the site was an undeveloped grass field (during 2001). The 5. 1 -ha on-airfield water detention structure was heavily utilized by waterfowl prior to modification. In fall 2001, the stormwater pond/wetland was re-graded, a manually controlled <b>spill</b> <b>valve</b> was added to the existing outflow channel, and approximately 32, 500 woody plants (e. g., willow) were planted within pond. During 2004, red-winged blackbird use was 30 % higher, whereas duck and Canada goose use was 96 % and 84 % lower, respectively, than during 2001 (prior to the habitat modifications). Management efforts to reduce the attractiveness of these two on-airfield attractants appeared to be effective at Paine Field...|$|E
