30|$|As {{users of}} mobile devices make phone calls, browse the web, or use an app, {{large volumes of}} data are {{routinely}} generated that are a potentially useful source for investigating human behavior in space. However, as such data are usually collected only as a by-product, they often lack stringent experimental design and ground truth, which makes interpretation and derivation of valid behavioral conclusions challenging. Here, we propose an unsupervised, data-driven approach to identify different user types based on high-resolution human movement data collected from a <b>smartphone</b> <b>navigation</b> app, {{in the absence of}} ground truth. We capture spatio-temporal footprints of users, characterized by meaningful summary statistics, which are then used in an unsupervised step to identify user types. Based on an extensive dataset of users of the mobile navigation app Sygic in Australia, we show how the proposed methodology allows to identify two distinct groups of users: ‘travelers’, visiting different areas with distinct, salient characteristics, and ‘locals’, covering shorter distances and revisiting many of their locations. We verify our approach by relating user types to space use: we find that travelers and locals prefer to visit distinct, different locations in the Australian cities Sydney and Melbourne, as suggested independently by other studies. Although we use high-resolution GPS data, the proposed methodology is potentially transferable to low-resolution movement data (e.g. Call Detail Records), since we rely only on summary statistics.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new method which facilitate {{the use of}} smartphones as a handheld low-cost mobile mapping system (MMS). Smartphones are becoming more sophisticated and smarter and are quickly closing the gap between computers and portable tablet devices. The current generation of smartphones are equipped with low-cost GPS receivers, high-resolution digital cameras, and micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) -based navigation sensors (e. g., accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetic compasses, and barometers). These sensors are in fact the essential components for a MMS. However, <b>smartphone</b> <b>navigation</b> sensors suffer from the poor accuracy of global navigation satellite System (GNSS), accumulated drift, and high signal noise. These issues affect {{the accuracy of the}} initial Exterior Orientation Parameters (EOPs) that are inputted into the bundle adjustment algorithm, which then produces inaccurate 3 D mapping solutions. This paper proposes new methodologies for increasing the accuracy of direct geo-referencing of smartphones using relative orientation and smartphone motion sensor measurements as well as integrating geometric scene constraints into free network bundle adjustment. The new methodologies incorporate fusing the relative orientations of the captured images and their corresponding motion sensor measurements to improve the initial EOPs. Then, the geometric features (e. g., horizontal and vertical linear lines) visible in each image are extracted and used as constraints in the bundle adjustment procedure which correct the relative position and orientation of the 3 D mapping solution...|$|E

40|$|Satellite {{navigation}} {{systems with}} GNSS-enabled devices, such as <b>smartphones,</b> car <b>navigation</b> systems, {{have changed the}} way users travel in outdoor environment. GNSS is generally not well suited for indoor location and navigation because of two reasons: First, GNSS {{does not provide a}} high level of accuracy although indoor applications need higher accuracies. Secondly, poor coverage of satellite signals for indoor environments decreases its accuracy. So rather than using GNSS satellites within closed environments, existing indoor navigation solutions rely heavily on installed sensor networks. There is a high demand for accurate positioning in wireless networks in GNSS-denied environments. However, current wireless indoor positioning systems cannot satisfy the challenging needs of indoor location-aware applications. Nevertheless, access to a user’s location indoors is increasingly important in the development of context-aware applications that increases business efficiency. In this study, how can the current wireless location sensing systems be tailored and integrated for specific applications, like smart cities/grids/buildings/cars and IoT applications, in GNSS-deprived areas...|$|R

40|$|Location {{awareness}} and navigation are {{becoming one of}} the most important features in mobile phones and <b>smartphones.</b> Personal <b>navigation</b> and location based services are enlarging the scope of mobile applications. GPS is the most efficient positioning technology. Thanks to the reduction in the size of the GPS receivers and the integration of GPS with mobile phones, GPS is {{one of the most important}} service providers in LBS. By the way, since mobile phones and smartphones usually have relatively low cost GPS chips, the performance of locating accuracy is highly dependent on environmental factors. In addition, the accuracy of GPS varies depending on the number of GPS satellites and is reduced in GPS interfering spots such as in a forest or around buildings. This paper proposes a localization improvement algorithm in GPS interfering spots by integrating information of multiple sensors in smartphones. The proposed algorithm is implemented in a smartphone and the performance is evaluated on a campus. The proposed algorithm has better performance than only the GPS location information in GPS interfering spots and maintains reasonable performance in open spaces where the GPS receiver is accurate...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, {{increasing}} traffic has led to serious problems in urban areas. Travel times for travellers have increased and the liveability in residential areas has declined due to pollution and issues concerning safety. Whereas new road and rail infrastructure in densely populated areas is costly, a better utilisation of existing infrastructure {{appears to be more}} attractive. This becomes increasingly possible due to huge developments in the world of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). However, implementing ICT solutions for the purpose of traffic management remains challenging. First, it is quite a task to set up a system in which infrastructure, travel vehicles and travellers can communicate with each other.

This paper deals with the latter issue, and it provides an outline for the possible architecture of a future traffic management system.

To eliminate the gauge step errors of the random bouncing motions, we designed a reliable algorithm for step detection.

In response to the challenge of magnetic disturbance, a quaternion-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) is introduced to determine the user's heading direction for each step.
