The measures provide for the redistribution of one-third of all arable land to African farmers. In the first five years, {{three and a half}} million hectares are due for redistribution. Tens of thousands of (potential) farmers are supposed to pledge sums, according to their means, ranging from ZAR 5, 000 to ZAR 405, 000 (h 778 to h 62, 985). They will be matched by a government grant only if the candidate agrees to follow a training course in agriculture. The grant should be used only for agricultural purposes: purchase of the land, equipment and other investments. Depending on the initial deposit, the grant will be for between 80 % and 20 % of the purchase price of the land the higher a candidate s own contribution, the lower the grant. Even at this early stage, the scheme has become grounded. The size of minimal own contribution expected from candidates excludes the poorest of the poor, since it represents more than a year s earnings. A second complaint {{is that it is a}} highly selective programme, forcing the candidate purchaser to present a business and financial plan to be approved by several bodies. The major obstacle is that it is a <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> <b>market.</b> Land owners are not rushing to sell off land under these conditions. The question is whether such a scheme will stay afloat.

A generalized Cournot model is estimated by two-stage least squares using pooled data sets for U. S. wheat and corn exports. The cross-sectional units correspond to foreign country destinations.

Yet, the estimated coefficients linking these market structure variables to the export price markup were relatively small in magnitude, suggesting little quantitative impact from market power.

The model allows us to characterize cooperation networks - networks in which each seller cooperates (by providing high quality goods) with every buyer that is connected to her. To this end, we provide conditions under which: [1] the incentives of a <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> to cooperate depend only on her beliefs with respect to her local neighborhood - a subnetwork that includes <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> and is of a size that is independent {{of the size of the}} entire network; and [2] the incentives of a <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> to cooperate can be calculated as if the network was a random tree with <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> at its root.

First, except China we find high cross-sectional correlation of the daily stock returns across the East Asian and the U. <b>S.</b> <b>markets.</b> A comparison of the results between the two sub-periods demonstrates a recent strengthening of the linkages. In particular, China records profound increases in its correlations with the other East Asian and the U. <b>S.</b> <b>markets.</b> Second, we find that {{with the exception of}} China the stock returns on the U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> exert {{a significant impact on the}} night-time market returns of Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan (in order).

Foreign firms that remain predominantly traded in the home market following cross-listing are valued similarly to non-cross-listed firms. To gain the full benefits of cross-listing, a foreign firm must convince investors that their shareholder rights will be protected.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which financial returns on market indices exhibit mean and volatility asymmetries, as a response to past information from both the U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> and the local market itself. In particular, we wish to assess the asymmetric effect of a combination of local and U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> news on volatility. To the best of the authors knowledge, this joint effect has not been considered previously. We propose a double threshold non-linear heteroscedastic model, combined with a GJR-GARCH effect in the conditional volatility equation, to capture jointly both mean and volatility asymmetric behaviours and the interactive effect of U. <b>S.</b> and local <b>market</b> news. In an application to five major international market indices, clear evidence of threshold non-linearity is discovered, supporting the hypothesis of an uneven mean-reverting pattern and volatility asymmetry, both in reaction to U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> news and news from the local market itself. Significant, but somewhat different, interactive effects between local and U. S. news are observed in all markets. An asymmetric pattern in the exogenous relationship between the local market and the U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> is also found. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
