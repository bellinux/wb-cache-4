5|$|Meanwhile, on 20 February 1948, Prokofiev's {{estranged wife}} Lina {{was arrested for}} 'espionage', as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> send money to her mother in Spain. After nine months of interrogation, she was sentenced by a three-member Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR to 20 years of hard labour. She was {{eventually}} released after Stalin's death in 1953 and in 1974 left the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{told the}} court that, during her {{interaction}} with WikiLeaks on IRC and Jabber, she developed a friendship with someone there, believed to be Julian Assange (although neither knew the other's name), which she said made her feel she could be herself. Army investigators found 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on her MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Assange. She wrote {{in a statement that}} the more <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> fit in at work, the more alienated she became from everyone around her. The relationship with WikiLeaks had given her a brief respite from the isolation and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Conley was cross-examined by {{the defense}} for 16 hours over three days, but the defense failed to break his story. The defense then moved to have Conley's entire {{testimony}} concerning the alleged rendezvous stricken from the record. Judge Roan noted that an early objection might have been upheld, but since the jury could not forget what it had heard, he allowed the evidence to stand. The prosecution, to support Frank's alleged expectation of a visit from Phagan, produced Helen Ferguson, a factory worker who first informed Phagan's parents of her death. Ferguson testified that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> get Phagan's pay on Friday from Frank, but was told that Phagan {{would have to come}} in person. Both the person behind the pay window and the woman behind Ferguson in the pay line disputed this version of events, testifying that in accordance with his normal practice, Frank did not disburse pay that day.|$|E

25|$|The play {{opens in}} the early morning hours of a cool day in May in the nursery of Lyubov Andreyevna Ranevskaya's ancestral estate, somewhere in the provinces of Russia just after the turn of the 20th Century. Ranevskaya has been living with an unnamed lover in France for five years, ever since her young son drowned. After {{receiving}} news that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> kill herself, Ranevskaya's 17-year-old daughter Anya and Anya's governess Charlotta Ivanovna have gone to fetch her and bring her home to Russia. They are accompanied by Yasha, Ranevskaya's valet who was with her in France. Upon returning, the group is met by Lopakhin, Dunyasha, Varya (who has overseen the estate in Ranevskaya's absence), Leonid Andreyevich Gayev, Boris Borisovich Simeonov-Pishchik, Semyon Yepikhodov, and Firs.|$|E

Iéna, {{under the command of}} Captain Maurice, was bound for the Persian Gulf with despatches, and had captured several ships. When Modeste captured Iena she was carrying 25,000 dollars she had taken from a vessel named Swallow, and had also captured an Arab vessel named Frederick, which Elliot retook. Iéna had mistaken Modeste for another merchant vessel and had tried to close on her. On discovering her mistake <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> escape, but had been caught after a nine-hour chase and an exchange of fire that left four or five Frenchmen dead or wounded, and one man killed and one wounded on Modeste.|$|E
500|$|In January 1987, Stella Nickell's adult daughter, Cynthia Hamilton, {{approached}} {{police with}} information: Nickell {{had spoken to}} her daughter repeatedly about wanting her husband dead. He was a bore, Nickell said, who after having gotten sober, preferred {{to stay home and}} watch television rather than go out to bars. Nickell, Hamilton claimed, had even told her that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> poison Bruce previously with foxglove. When that failed, she had begun library research into other methods and hit upon cyanide. [...] Cynthia also claimed that Nickell had spoken to her about what the two of them could do with the insurance money if Bruce Nickell were dead.|$|E

500|$|Sarah {{had always}} been jealous of Anne's affection for Abigail Masham, since having learned of it. Together with the Duke of Marlborough {{and most of the}} Whig party, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> force Anne to dismiss her. All these {{attempts}} failed, even when Anne was threatened with an official parliamentary demand from the Whigs, who were suspicious of Abigail's Tory influence with Anne, for Abigail's dismissal. The whole scenario echoed Anne's refusal to give up Sarah during the reign of William and Mary; but the threat of Parliamentary interference exceeded anything tried against Anne in the 1690s. Anne was ultimately triumphant; she conducted interviews with high-ranking politicians of both political parties and begged them [...] "with tears in her eyes" [...] to oppose the motion. The general view was that the Marlboroughs had made themselves look ridiculous over a trivial matter- since when, it was asked, did Parliament address the Queen on whom she should employ in her bedchamber? ...|$|E
500|$|Group members {{expressed}} {{just how}} demanding {{their role in}} the group had been, describing the job as [...] "hard work" [...] and [...] "a tough gig", with touring for nine months of every year and filming the television series for most of the remainder, creating little time in their lives for anything else. Members also saw importance of being [...] "career driven" [...] and in portraying a positive image of themselves to the public in their personal lives, being [...] "always on". However, the cast insisted that the stressful work was well worth it to see a smile on a child's face, and described the bond between the members as [...] "like family". In 2005 Harding stated the lifestyle was [...] "quite hard in the beginning." [...] In October 2015 Robinson stated <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> leave the group [...] "after eight years" [...] but was convinced by producers to stay. She expressed that the following years she spent with the group were her favourite, and that she was proud of her decision to continue.|$|E
500|$|Her {{affiliation}} with the party allowed her {{to travel to the}} Soviet Union in 1929 as a Scottish delegate to a gathering of young communists. In the same year <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> join the National Unemployed Workers' Movement, but was told that women were not allowed to be members. Docherty had a great love for the Soviet Union, despite what she saw as a political breakdown in that country. Vladimir Lenin was an idol of hers. During her time in Russia she spent three months in a sanatorium near the Black Sea, recovering from tuberculosis. She had had an operation on a tumor related to the disease before she left Fife, but was cured completely at the sanatorium. She also visited a motor vehicle factory, and found it impressive, because [...] "it [...] for their sel', it was for everybody because everything belonged to them". During her time in Moscow, she learned Russian, visited the Bolshoi, and took part in a parade on the 12th anniversary of the Russian Revolution. Of her time in the Soviet Union, she stated: ...|$|E

500|$|Lynd visits Bond {{every day}} as he recuperates in hospital, and he {{gradually}} realises that he loves her; he even contemplates leaving the Secret Service to settle down with her. When he is released from hospital they spend time together at a quiet guest house and eventually become lovers. One day they see a mysterious man named Gettler tracking their movements, which greatly distresses Lynd. The following morning, Bond finds that she has committed suicide. She leaves behind a note explaining {{that she had been}} working as an unwilling double agent for the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. SMERSH had kidnapped her lover, a Polish Royal Air Force pilot, who had revealed information about her under torture; SMERSH then used that information to blackmail her into helping them undermine Bond's mission, including her own faked kidnapping. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> start a new life with Bond, but upon seeing Gettler—a SMERSH agent—she realised that she would never be free of her tormentors, and that staying with Bond would only put him in danger. Bond informs his service of Lynd's duplicity, coldly telling his contact, [...] "The bitch is dead now." ...|$|E
500|$|Babe {{was billed}} as [...] "a no-nonsense, bustling busybody with a big heart", who is also both shrewd and tough under her bubbly personality. Badland {{described}} Babe as [...] "quite a private person" [...] that would [...] "protect her family", who she was [...] "proud" [...] to be in contact with again. She said she that Babe enjoys keeping [...] "control in a social way" [...] and that despite having a [...] "front of being jolly", Babe could also get [...] "very angry" [...] and be [...] "ruthless". She said that Babe {{is the kind of}} person who, when someone crosses her, just does and says the things that other people would not think of doing or saying until it is too late, and though <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> find trigger points that influence Babe's vengefulness, had realised that Babe was [...] "wicked" [...] just [...] "for the joy of it". Rebecca Scroggs, who plays Tosh Mackintosh, described Babe as [...] "a lovely woman" [...] with a darker side that could make her the [...] "most fearsome Carter of all". Badland also revealed that she never wanted Babe to be [...] "modified into a more ordinary person" [...] because she [...] "relished" [...] the character.|$|E
500|$|She is a {{powerful}} necromancer; while she is surveying dead bodies in a battlefield {{it is noted that}} [...] "If <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> raise up the entire army on the field to return to war, the laws of Erebus would have yielded, and a hostpulled from the Stygian Avernus by her terrible powerwould have gone to war." [...] It {{is for this reason that}} she is sought by Pompey the Great's son, Sextus Pompeius. He wants her to perform a necromantic rite so that he might be able to learn the outcome of the Battle of Pharsalus. Erichtho complies and wanders amidst a battlefield to seek out a cadaver with [...] "uninjured tissues of a stiffened lung". She cleans the corpse's organs, and fills the body with a potion (consisting of, among other things, a mixture of warm blood, [...] "lunar poison", and [...] "everything that nature wickedly bears") so as to bring the dead body back to life. The spirit is summoned, but, at first, refuses to return to its old body. She then promptly threatens the entire universe by promising to summon [...] "that god at whose dread name earth trembles". Immediately following this outburst, the corpse is reanimated and offers a bleak description of a civil war in the underworld, as well as a rather ambiguous (at least, to Sextus Pompeius) prophecy about the fate that lies in store for Pompey and his kin.|$|E

500|$|The {{media were}} {{generally}} {{critical of the}} church, presenting it as a cult. The first negative local press articles appeared in 1988, mentioning miraculous healings, proselytism, Kennel's status, fundamentalist beliefs as controversial issues, and included critical reports by former members. Fath noted that the vocabulary and arguments used in the media were intentionally slanted and the repetition of those developed by the CCMM, and that the disproportionate {{media coverage of the}} church did not facilitate an objective investigation. According to a study by an expert in new religious movements, Massimo Introvigne, when a former member destroyed furniture belonging to the church in Langres in July1994, anti-cult associations and some news media took the former member's side, presenting him as the [...] "victim" [...] of a [...] "cult". On the French talk show Ça se discute (broadcast on 25May2005 on France 2), a father (whose nine-year-old daughter {{was a member of the}} church with her mother) said his daughter was brainwashed; he criticized her proselytism at school, closed-mindedness and the role of women in the church. He explained that when he had suffered from cancer two years earlier, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> miraculously heal him; however, she considered him a liar and a sinner because of his homosexuality. He said he found her diary, in which she spoke of her imminent death when she would reach heaven to meet her grandparents. The association for the defense of religious freedom and conscience, , criticized the talk show for its lack of alternative viewpoints.|$|E

Highsmith never resolved this love–hate relationship, which reportedly haunted her {{for the rest of}} her life, and which she fictionalized in [...] "The Terrapin," [...] her short story about a young boy who stabs his mother to death.

2500|$|Following {{the murder}} of Meredith Hunter at the Altamont Free Concert in 1969, KSAN put on a four-hour {{telephone}} call-in program to discuss the events. A woman who called in gave details about the violent behavior of Hells Angels at the show and said people didn't stop them because [...] "we were all in terror of them". At the concert, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> speak up against the violence, but was warned to be quiet by the people around her, {{for fear of being}} beaten.

Evidence from the 1997 re-trial was presented again. The defense argued that Lambert had not participated in the act, that she had been sent out of the room by Yunkin, and that Lambert had obeyed everything Yunkin had ordered of her due to battered woman syndrome. A previous boyfriend of Lambert's confirmed that he had witnessed Yunkin [...] "yank [...] into a room", upon which point Yunkin began yelling at her. He testified that he had seen a police officer matching one of the descriptions Lambert gave of her alleged rapists give her a [...] "threatening glare" [...] at a local festival.|$|E
