5|$|A {{free-standing}} minaret, {{built by}} Katkhuda, originally <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> gate. The minaret was demolished {{prior to the}} opening of al-Azhar street by Tewfik Pasha during modernization efforts which took place throughout Cairo.|$|E
5|$|During his infancy, he {{was raised}} in a large hale pili (thatched house) named Auanakeo, which <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Huliheʻe Palace, the {{principal}} residence of Leleiohoku's hānai (adoptive) father Kuakini, who was the Governor of Hawaii Island.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E

5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} between Bret and Owen Hart. The {{beginning of the}} match {{went back and forth}} with neither wrestler gaining a strong advantage. The tension between the two was demonstrated by Owen's bragging and Bret's refusal to let Owen leave the ring. Owen eventually gained momentum by using a camel clutch on Bret and performing suplexes and a Tombstone piledriver. When Owen <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> ring to recuperate, Bret jumped over the top rope to attack him. Bret landed awkwardly, however, and suffered a kayfabe injury to his knee. Owen used a figure four leglock to capitalize on Bret's sore leg. Bret was able to recover, and he kicked Owen {{in the back of the}} head and used a Bulldog and sleeper hold to weaken Owen. Owen regained the advantage, however, and applied the Sharpshooter on Bret. Bret was able to escape and perform a Sharpshooter on Owen. Bret then attempted to end the match with a victory roll, but Owen blocked it and pinned Bret to win the match.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Henry's expansion, StPeter ad Vincula, a Norman chapel which had {{previously}} <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls {{for himself and his}} queen. It was rebuilt by EdwardI at a cost of over £300 and again by HenryVIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19thcentury. Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built {{at the same time as}} the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a simple structure, protected by a portcullis and gate. The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16thcentury, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower. Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663 just over £4,000 was spent building a new storehouse (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor.|$|E
25|$|Lhasa Zhol Village has two stone pillars or rdo-rings, an {{interior}} stone pillar or doring nangma, which stands within the village fortification walls, and the exterior stone pillar or doring chima, which originally <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> South {{entrance to the}} village. Today the pillar stands neglected to the East of the Liberation Square, on the South side of Beijing Avenue.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, Gerbic and Edward {{organized}} {{a protest against}} Sylvia Browne when she appeared at the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on July 13 of that year. Joined by Benjamin Radford, Ross Blocher, Bob Blaskiewitz, Jay Diamond, and others, the group <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> venue and handed out leaflets describing cold reading techniques and describing some of so-called psychic predictions Browne has made {{over the years that}} have been proven to be incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Continuing the tradition, {{members of}} the San Diego Order have made a {{presence}} at a Christian fundamentalist youth revival meeting called Teen Mania Ministries from 2006 to 2008. Sisters Iona Dubble-Wyde and Freeda Sole <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Cox Arena in full regalia to intercept pastors and attendees. The responses from the children and adolescents were varied. While some told the Sisters {{they were going to}} hell, others asked questions and offered thanks and hugs; the event was generally reported as positive.|$|E
25|$|The southwestern park also {{contains}} two monuments. One, American Boy, was commissioned in 1923 by French sculptor Louis St. Lannes and carved from one block of Indiana Limestone. A {{tribute to the}} athletic body, it once <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Rice Stadium and Recreation Building; the stadium, named and funded by the widow of Isaac Leopold Rice, stood at the site from the 1920s until 1989. The former stadium site is now the Pelham Track and Field. The other is the Bronx Victory Column & Memorial Grove.|$|E

25|$|In 1957, Abe Aronovitz, who {{had been}} Mayor of Miami in 1953–55, invited High to run for mayor. With Aronovitz's backing, High ran on a {{platform}} of promising nothing but honest government. He did not accept any campaign contributions of more than US$250.00. With his campaign unable to afford the billboards and television advertising that other candidates were using, High supporters <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Orange Bowl with home-made campaign banners on every Friday night that the University of Miami football team played a home game.|$|E
25|$|In 1966 Laver, aged 27, married Mary Benson in San Rafael, California. Born Mary Shelby Peterson in Illinois, {{she was a}} divorcee {{with three}} children. After their wedding ceremony, a group of {{well-known}} tennis players in attendance, including Lew Hoad, Ken Rosewall, Roy Emerson, Mal Anderson and Barry MacKay, <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> church with raised tennis rackets that formed an archway for the newlyweds to walk under. Laver and Mary had a son and the family lived at various locations in California including Rancho Mirage, Corona del Mar, a ranch near Santa Barbara and Carlsbad.|$|E
25|$|Before the Norman conquest a small Saxon chapel {{dedicated}} to St Peter <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> east gate of Shrewsbury; {{it had been}} built by Siward, son of Ethelgar and a close relative of Edward the Confessor. There was still a landowner, known as Siward the Fat, in Shropshire at Domesday, although he had owned many more estates in 1066. He {{must have been the}} donor of the two estates the church is known from Domesday to have held in 1066: at Boreton near Condover and Lowe near Farley. However, the Abbey had lost Lowe by 1087.|$|E

25|$|Having been {{promoted}} to full general on 27 May 1825 Cotton became Commander-in-Chief, India. In that role on 18January 1826, after a three-week siege, he stormed {{the capital of the}} Princely state of Bharatpur with its fort, which had previously been deemed impregnable, and restored the rightful raja to the throne. For his success in India he was raised in the peerage as Viscount Combermere on 8February 1827. On his return to England, he brought with him the 17.75-ton Bhurtpore gun, which for many years <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Royal Artillery Barracks at Woolwich. He retired from active service in 1830.|$|E
25|$|On the {{north-east}} and north-west {{corners of}} the steps two cannon were placed, some time after 1900. They are possibly Dutch in origin, and {{were found on the}} seabed on 11 January and 10 April 1899 during the construction of the third Herne Bay Pier. They fired blanks as a fog-warning, and had been mounted on the first Pier until 1862. New carriages and brass plates dating the recovery were made for them. They <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> old Pier Theatre and were moved later {{to the base of the}} Tower. A plaque, dedicated to the 36 fallen Herne Bay volunteers of the Second Boer War, was affixed shortly after 1902 to the north side. It features some well-known local surnames, such as Ridout.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday 7 April 1973, {{the opening}} round of the VFL season {{included}} a match held at Windy Hill between Essendon and Richmond, which became in effect a John Coleman memorial. Richmond defeated Essendon by 2 points that day, the decisive last goal of the game kicked by Richmond's Kevin Sheedy, who {{would go on to}} be Essendon's next premiership winning coach (1984) after Coleman. After a large funeral conducted at St Thomas' Church of England, in Mount Alexander Road, Moonee Ponds (the church in which he had married) by Archdeacon Randal Hugh Deasey (1916–) on Monday 9 April 1973, attended by many of Melbourne's sporting community, Coleman was cremated. 400 people packed into the church, and another 600 <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> church listening to the service broadcast over loudspeakers.|$|E

25|$|Seventeen boys died {{immediately}} and another seven died later in hospital, {{all but one}} on the same night. Those who were uninjured {{were all in the}} front ranks. The military funeral of twenty of the boys who died was held at Rochester Cathedral on 12 December 1951 and conducted by the Bishop of Rochester. Thousands of local people <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> cathedral and lined the route of the funeral procession to Gillingham Cemetery. Royal Marines guarded the coffins and acted as pall bearers and the ceremony was attended by, among others, the Second Sea Lord, the Commandant-General Royal Marines, and the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary of the Admiralty. Three of the boys who were Roman Catholics had a separate funeral at the Church of Our Lady, Gillingham, conducted by the Bishop of Southwark Cyril Cowderoy.|$|E
25|$|At {{the back}} of the town house lie six of the seven provost's lamps of the former royal burghs within Kirkcaldy district. The six lamps are from: Kirkcaldy, Burntisland, Kinghorn, Leven, and Buckhaven and Methil. These lamps once <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> houses of senior councillors, and were all brought to this site when the royal burghs were {{abolished}} in 1975. Only the lamp for Leslie is not there. Around the building, both of the town's two coats of arms can be seen. The spiritual coat of arms showing St Bryce is located at the south entrance and the one which depicts Dunfermline Abbey is at the west entrance. Inside the building itself, displayed across the stairwell is a mural designed by Walter Pritchard of the Glasgow School of Art. This makes references to the industries associated with the town such as linoleum, coal mining and weaving. Other references are to famous people such as Adam Smith and the Adam Brothers. Charles II is shown granting the town its royal burgh status in 1644, received by a figure in a Sinclair tartan.|$|E
25|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century the country began to gain {{relatively}} large numbers of non-conformist churches and congregations, which were Evangelical in outlook. Many of these were part of organisations that originated in England and Wales. They were known in Scotland as voluntary churches, since they <b>stood</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> established system and participation and any payments were voluntary. The Quakers had established themselves in Scotland {{in the seventeenth century}} and Baptist, Congregationalist and Methodist churches had appeared in the eighteenth century, but did not begin significant growth until {{the nineteenth century}}, partly because more radical and evangelical traditions already existed within the Church of Scotland and the free churches. The Congregationalists organised themselves into a union in 1812, the Baptists, who were divided into Calvinists and non-Calvinist tendencies, did the same in 1869. The Methodist Church had probably been limited by its anti-Calvinist theology, but made advances in the century, particularly in Shetland. From 1879, they were joined by the evangelical revivalism of the Salvation Army, which attempted to make major inroads in the growing urban centres. The Open and Exclusive Brethren entered Scotland {{in the late nineteenth century}} and the Open Brethren had 116 meetings in Scotland by 1884.|$|E
