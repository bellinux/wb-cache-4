[...] Bush stated that [...] "the decision to dismantle the Iraqi army was a mistake, and I think my brother would admit that today." [...] Bush blamed President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the rise of ISIS and other post-Iraq War turmoil, saying that this was caused by a [...] "premature" [...] withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011. This statement attracted criticism (from Army Chief of Staff Raymond Odierno and others) because the U.S. withdrawal in 2011 was negotiated in 2008 by the George W. Bush administration.|$|R
