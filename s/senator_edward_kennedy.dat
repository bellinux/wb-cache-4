At the end of the month, Humphrey began to court <b>Senator</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Kennedy</b> of Massachusetts, the younger brother of Robert Kennedy, as a possible running mate, hoping the Senator would increase his chances of winning the support of liberals, and alleviate the criticism spawned from his connections to Johnson. Kennedy declined. Humphrey also asked Larry O'Brien, who had been named as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, to be his campaign manager.
