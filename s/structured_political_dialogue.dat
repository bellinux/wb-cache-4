40|$|Improving {{external}} {{relations and the}} management of development aid is {{a key component of}} the current reform of the European Union (EU). In the course of the 1990 s, the promotion of democracy, the strengthening of good governance and enhancing the rule of law progressively became both an objective and a condition for the EU development assistance with developing countries. Achieving these sometimes-contradictory goals in practice is a permanent challenge. This paper reviews the EU’s policies and strategies aimed at preventing conflict and responding to the crises of governance. It explores the difficult combination of democracy assistance and governance conditionality and its applicability to the prevention of democratic erosion in developing countries. While the EU mainly relies on a positive approach of support and inducement, it has also introduced, since 1995, provisions to suspend aid {{in the event of a}} sudden and persistent interruption of the democratisation process. The suspension mechanism enshrined in the cooperation agreement between the EU and ACP countries has made political dialogue the main strategic tool for achieving these varied purposes. Mainstreaming political dialogue into the cooperation forces the EC to focus more explicitly and more rigorously on issues of power, politics and democracy than it has done in the past. Governance conditionality constitutes a critical juncture between democracy promotion and conflict prevention strategies. The article is organised in three substantive sections. It successively addresses the policy, strategy and implementation dilemmas of EC democracy and governance activities in third countries, reviewing the policy responses of the EC to the crises of governance in Niger, Haiti, Côte d’Ivoire and Fiji. It argues that conducting <b>structured</b> <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> puts further demands on the management of aid. While punitive forms of political conditionality have proved largely ineffective, an incentive-based approach to governance conditionality could yield, if well managed, greater results. The article concludes with a series of proposals for enhancing the European Commission’s ability to manage political dialogue and governance conditionality to encourage democracy and prevent conflict...|$|E
40|$|Do {{politicians}} talk to {{each other}} or talk past each other? In the last few years there has been renewed interest in the strategic thinking that drive politicians to engage in <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> with peers from a different political color. Most of this research, however, has been limited to understanding <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> in the campaign trail or in Congress. The dynamics of daily <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> in the written media, by contrast, have received limited attention. This research explores the dynamics of <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> through a statistical analysis of op-ed articles written by over 400 politicians in Venezuela. Using more than 6, 000 articles published in the Venezuelan media in 2004, I analyze the degree to which politicians engage in <b>political</b> <b>dialogue...</b>|$|R
40|$|Does the {{existence}} of <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> signal the lack of party institutionalization? Research on <b>political</b> <b>dialogue,</b> and the dynamics of issue ownership and issue salience, argues that parties have no incentive to trespass on issues owned by opponents. This requires that parties have niches of advantaged issues, which are obtained through the specialization of parties and their members via their platform and experiences in office. This characteristic signals {{the existence}} of an institutionalized party system where the party label has a meaning the electorate can interpret. In a non-institutionalized system; however, the party label has no meaningful value. In this context parties lack the programmatic clarity and experience that gives them advantages on issues. Given this, <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> should be more prevalent because politicians will be prone {{to talk to each other}} in order to set the agenda, attempt to control issues, and send signals to the electorate. As parties define themselves and become institutionalized, issues will become owned and parties will have more incentive to talk past each other, effectively diminishing <b>political</b> <b>dialogue.</b> In this paper I seek to understand these dynamics and the relationship of wining <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> and party system institutionalization. I argue that following a party system collapse, and the subsequent de-institutionalization of the parties, <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> will be more frequent; however, as political actors adapt to their new environment instances of <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> will diminish, signaling that the new party system is institutionalizing...|$|R
40|$|Russians {{overwhelmingly}} {{see themselves}} as part of Europe, yet appreciate their Asian connection; there {{is a continuation of}} the 'Great Debate' between Westernizers and Slavophiles. Decades of official acrimony towards the EC were followed by acceptance of West European integration, if it did not involve Russia's isolation. After a period of rapprochement with Europe, a feeling of betrayal has recently grown in Russia. Nevertheless, the trend is for ever closer links with the West. From the EU's perspective, Member States' conflicting views on the New Europe hinder a united approach to solutions. The EU has gained a very strong position {{with the collapse of the}} CMEA. The EU-Russia Partnership Agreement shows that vested interests of EU producers often prevail, yet useful <b>structures</b> for <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> were nonetheless created, and the prospect of a common free trade area is momentous. The need for a new security structure is unlikely to be satisfied by NATO's Partnership for Peace, but the EU has failed to lead European calls for a WEU or CSCE-based security framework. The inheritance of the command economy has damaged foreign trade and investment conditions. Despite the transformation of the economy, much needs to be done to improve investment conditions for foreigners as well as for potential exporters - fiscal, export and property legislation must become workable, and the need to make a profit must be respected. Nonetheless, foreign investment projects are growing fast. The energy and aeronautics industries are used as case studies of the new possibilities for foreign investors and Russian exporters. Having long been aimed at restricting Russian economic growth, statecraft has become an instrument of growth. The EU's assistance is particularly beneficial as it is non-reimbursable and aims at long-term change through training, yet TACIS could be improved by better management, smaller projects and lower wages. Overall, Western investment in Russian stability should increase...|$|R
