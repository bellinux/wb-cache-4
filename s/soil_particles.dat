40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to determine spatial distribution of heavy metals concentration in <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size classes using Landsat ETM+ reflectance in Southern Isfahan city {{in the vicinity of}} Bama mine. To fulfill this goal, 100 compound soil surface samples were collected randomly from the area. The samples were air dried and <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size classes 250 - 500, 125 - 250, 75 - 125, 50 - 75 and < 50 μm were determined using appropriate sieves after dispersion of the bulk samples of soil using ultrasonic apparatus. Total Zn, Pb and Cd concentrations were measured using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer after wet digestion of samples in acid nitric. The results indicated significant negative correlation coefficients between heavy metals concentrations of <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size classes and soil spectral reflectance in the visible, near infrared and panchromatic bands of Landsat ETM+ satellite. Stepwise multiple regression models were used for estimating heavy metals concentration in <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> classes through satellite data. Furthermore, spatial distributions of heavy metals were mapped using stepwise multiple regression equations. Results also showed heavy metals concentrations in all <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size classes were maximum close to the mines and decreased by increasing the distance from these sources...|$|R
40|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>particle</b> size {{distribution}} and bulk density {{are used for}} estimating soil-moisture characteristic curve. In this model, <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> {{size distribution}} curve is divided {{into a number of}} segments, each with a specific particle radius and cumulative percentage of the particles greater than that radius. Using these data, soil-moisture characteristic curve is estimated. In the model a scale factor, a, is used which may be considered as a constant, or obtained by logistic or linear procedures. F or most conditions, <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution curve is not available, but only the percentages of clay, silt and sand could be obtained using soil textural data. In this situation, at first a precise <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution must be developed, based on which the soil-moisture characteristic curve can be predicted. According to the previous studies, using particle radius of 999 µ m is more appropriate than radius 125 µ m. Also, adjusted coefficients for estimating <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution curve for radii 1 to 20   µ m was obtained. In this study, using the soil textural data of 19 different soils from UNSODA database, soil-moisture characteristic curve of each was estimated with logistic and linear methods based on initial and adjusted <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution estimation.

5|$|Violet {{root rot}} {{caused by the}} fungus Helicobasidium purpureum {{sometimes}} affects the roots, covering them with a purplish mat to which <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> adhere. The leaves become distorted and discolored and the mycelium can spread through the soil between plants. Some weeds can harbour this fungus and it is more prevalent in wet, acid conditions. Erysiphe heraclei causes a powdery mildew that can cause significant crop loss. Infestation by this causes results in yellowing of the leaf and loss of foliage.

5|$|Water {{is usually}} only found deep inside holes {{at the bottom}} of {{blow-out}} craters. Animals therefore get the moisture they need directly from their food. The black soil on and around cinder cones does not hold moisture for long, making it difficult for plants to establish themselves. <b>Soil</b> <b>particles</b> first develop from direct rock decomposition by lichens and typically collect in crevices in lava flows.

40|$|Polygonum cuspidatum, P. weyrichii and Artemisia pedunculosa are {{herbaceous}} perennials in the alpine zone on Mt. Fuji. The effect of <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size on seed germination and seedling growth {{of these species}} was investigated. In the experiment three different <b>particle</b> size <b>soils</b> (large <b>particle</b> size LPS, medium particle size MPS, and small particle size SPS) were used. The other experiment was designed under three different watering intervals (every day, every two days, and every four days). <b>Soil</b> <b>particle</b> size had {{a great impact on}} seed germination and seedling growth. The highest percentage of seeds germinated in SPS and lowest in LPS soil, irrespective of the species. In the case of A. pedunculosa {{there was no significant difference}} of seed germination between SPS and MPS soils. However, the other two species had significantly reduced percentages of seed germination with increasing <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size. The maximum root length of seedlings was significantly longer in LPS and MPS compared to the SPS soil group, for all species. The number of root tips was increased with decreasing <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size, irrespective of the species. Further, larger aboveground biomass was found in seedlings of SPS than those of LPS and MPS. A. pedunculosa showed a slightly different pattern of seed germination and seedling growth compared to the two Polygonum species. Seed germination of A. pedunculosa was comparatively independent of <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size, and it may have conservative water use strategy. On the other hand, seed germination of Polygonum species was highly affected by the <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size, and those species may adapt to the water deficit condition by taking up water from deeper soil...|$|R

5|$|Protactinium {{occurs in}} {{uraninite}} (pitchblende) at concentrations of about 0.3-3 parts 231Pa per million parts (ppm) of ore. Whereas the usual content {{is closer to}} 0.3 ppm (e.g. in Jáchymov, Czech Republic), some ores from the Democratic Republic of the Congo have about 3 ppm. Protactinium is homogeneously dispersed in most natural materials and in water, but at much lower concentrations {{on the order of}} one part per trillion, that corresponds to the radioactivity of 0.1 picocuries (pCi)/g. There is about 500 times more protactinium in sandy <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> than in water, even the water present in the same sample of soil. Much higher ratios of 2,000 and above are measured in loam soils and clays, such as bentonite.|$|E
5|$|With {{the average}} {{concentration}} of about 8 {{parts per million}} (ppm), samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust. It is the fifth most abundant lanthanide and is more common than elements such as tin. Samarium concentration in soils varies between 2 and 23ppm, and oceans contain about 0.5–0.8parts per trillion. Distribution of samarium in soils strongly depends on its chemical state and is very inhomogeneous: in sandy soils, samarium concentration is about 200 times higher at the surface of <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> than in the water trapped between them, and this ratio can exceed 1,000 in clays.|$|E
5|$|Scandium has no {{biological}} role, but it {{is found}} in living organisms. Once reached a human, scandium concentrates in the liver and {{is a threat to}} it; some its compounds are possibly carcinogenic, even through in general scandium is not toxic. Scandium is known to have reached the food chain, but in trace amounts only; a typical human takes in less than 0.1micrograms per day. Once released into the environment, scandium gradually accumulates in soils, which leads to increased concentrations in <b>soil</b> <b>particles,</b> animals and humans. Scandium is mostly dangerous in the working environment, {{due to the fact that}} damps and gases can be inhaled with air. This can cause lung embolisms, especially during long-term exposure. The element is known to damage cell membranes of water animals, causing several negative influences on reproduction and on the functions of the nervous system.|$|E
40|$|To obtain soil-moisture {{characteristic}} curve experimentally is time-consuming and usually subject to considerable errors. So, many investigators {{have tried to}} predict soil-moisture {{characteristic curve}} by different models. One of these models predicts soil moisture characteristic curve based on <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution and bulk density. In this model, <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution curve is divided {{into a number of}} segments, each with a specific particle radius and cumulative particle mass greater than that of the radius. Using these data, soil-moisture characteristic curve was estimated. In this model, a scale factor, α, is used which may be considered as a constant, or obtained by logistic or linear procedures. The average values of α for clay, silty clay, sandy loam, two loam soils, and two silty clay loam soils were 1. 159, 1. 229, 1. 494, 1. 391, 1. 393, 1. 253 and 1. 254, respectively. For most conditions, <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution curve is not available, but only the percentages of clay, silt, and sand could be obtained using soil textural data, which is not enough to draw a precise <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution curve. In this situation, a precise <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution curve must be initially developed on the basis of which the soil moisture characteristic curve can be predicted. In this study, using soil textural data of seven different soils, soil moisture characteristic curve of each was estimated. In these estimations, logistic and linear methods were used to obtain the α value. Then, the results were compared with those of measured soil moisture characteristic curve. For estimation of <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution curve, two extreme values for <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> radius, 125 and 999 m, were used. The results indicated that using particle radius of 999 µm is more appropriate. On the other hand, it was found that for clay, silty clay, and sitly clay loam texture, it is more appropriate to employ a linear equation to determine for estimating soil-moisture characteristic curve while the logistic equation can be more appropriately used for loam and sand loam textures...|$|R

5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch {{out of the side of}} this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to <b>soil</b> <b>particles</b> in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E

The result showed that decreasing percentage of solar radiation was decreased causing the reflection of radiation from the sun. Moreover high concentration of solar radiation from spectrum between 390 - 400 nm by small sea salt aerosol and <b>soil</b> <b>particle.</b> Radiation from the sun with wave-length (visible-light 400 - 700 nm) was increased due to size of <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> and sea salt aerosol were smaller than the size of the wave-length. Radiation from the sun with wave-length (infrared 700 - 1040 nm) was increased in both sea salt aerosol and <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> because the size of sea salt and <b>soil</b> <b>particle</b> were smaller than wave-length. The higher concentration of the sun concentration was in the wave-length between 910 - 930 nm and wave-length between 955 - 961 nm both in sea salt aerosol and <b>soil</b> <b>particle.</b> In additionally there should be a reduction of solar radiation in the wave-length between 955 - 961 nm.

We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which individual ramets of the wetland plant Bolboschoenus planiculmis were grown in three homogeneous soil treatments with uniformly sized quartz particles (small: 0. 75 mm, medium: 1. 5 mm, or large: 3 mm), one homogeneous treatment with an even mixture of large and medium particles, and two heterogeneous treatments consisting of 16 or 4 patches of large and medium particles. Biomass, ramet number, rhizome length and spacer length were significantly greater in the treatment with only medium particles than in the one with only large particles.
