6000|$|... "Heave {{the ship}} to, and hold fast every thing," [...] cried the captain, {{apparently}} just springing to the deck. [...] "One boat's enough. Steward; <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> {{there from the}} mizzen-top. Boat ahoy!--Have you got that man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, what's {{the matter}} with thy face, my son?' said the miller, staring. 'David, <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> here.' And a candle was thrust against Bob's cheek, where there {{appeared}} a jagged streak like the geological remains of a lobster.|$|E

50|$|The body of Hrabea is 7 - 8 cm long, and {{consists}} of 146-183 segments. The body wall is thin and transparent, but when illuminated, <b>shows</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> green tint. It swims actively by lateral undulating movements. The setae are one-pointed.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{group of}} three {{bungalows}} nearer to me than the others. Into one of these three they had gone, and I was too late to see which. All had doors and windows carelessly open, and none <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Amos Green laughed heartily. [...] "When {{you have}} {{travelled}} {{in the woods}} by night as often as I have," [...] said he, [...] "when to <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> may mean to lose your hair, one comes to learn to use one's eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, good man, we {{are what}} I say," [...] Rupert said. [...] "Open an upstairs {{casement}} and <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>light,</b> {{and you will}} see that we have a lady with us. We are but two men. Look out, I say. We will pay you well. We need shelter for the lady." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{can take}} your pick,' said Mr Boffin, 'and it'll {{be as good as}} eight or ten shillings a week added to your income.

Now, if you'll <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>light,</b> I'll come to your office-room and dispose of a letter or two.' ...|$|E

6000|$|We never <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> till we {{was about}} ten mile below the village. Then we lit up {{and had a}} supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they'd served them people. The duke says: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{will have}} to go under the easiest sail possible. The brig can go two feet to this craft's one, and you will only want your lower sails. If you put on more you will be running ahead and losing us at night. We shall <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> over our stern, and on no account are you to allow yourselves to lose sight of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Giuseppi, {{you must}} stay here. Do you collect a {{quantity}} of dried sticks, and lay them in readiness at that point opposite the ledge. We will <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> as we come along, that is if we succeed in getting the Lido out, and directly you see it {{set fire to the}} sticks. The fire will be a guide to us as to the position of the rocks." ...|$|E

We have sentries along the river bank, {{and a few others}} {{scattered}} about; but none of the troops are quartered there, nor even in this line of villas where we now are. If we were to <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> at night, in any window here, we should have a shell in in a couple of minutes. We have no fear, whatever, of a sortie in this direction; and have plenty of force behind." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{light was}} {{electrified}} in the 1960s.

6000|$|... "Then {{search the}} whole {{of the back of the}} island with boats, keeping at oar's length from the cliffs. There must be some places where a man can climb up, {{probably}} gulleys worn by streams. Then to-morrow night sail round and join us again. I will be waiting for you about two miles off the land, and will <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> to seaward so that you will know where to find me. Then we can talk matters over, and you can get back to the other side again before morning." ...|$|E
60|$|A rare {{place was}} {{this in the}} old {{smuggling}} days, and indeed until quite lately the trade was carried on, though upon a reduced scale. Vessels drifting slowly up the river would <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> as they passed a barge at anchor or a bawley hanging to its trawl, a light would be shown in answer, {{and a moment later}} a boat would row off to the ship, and a score of tubs or a dozen bales of tobacco be quickly transferred, and before morning the contents would be stowed in underground cellars in some of the little farmhouses on the creeks, or be hidden away in the Leigh marshes.|$|E
60|$|That evening, at nine o'clock, Bob {{embarked}} {{on board the}} fishing boat, at the New Mole. One of the governor's aides-de-camp accompanied him, to pass him through all the guards; and orders had been sent, to the officers {{in command of the}} various batteries, that the boat was not to be challenged. It was to <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> from a lantern, as it went along, in order that it might be known. The other two passengers and the boatmen had been sitting there since before gunfire, and they were glad enough when Bob came down and took his seat in the stern, taking the tiller ropes.|$|E
60|$|Only {{one window}} <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> behind them; in it there stood a lamp, and beside it, {{seated at a}} table, was a dear old ruddy-faced woman in a country cap. She was bending over her {{knitting}} and stopping occasionally to stroke a large black cat upon a stool beside her.|$|R
25|$|From 6 June 1944, all amusements and theatres were closed. Curfew was {{extended}} from 9pm to 6am. Distant guns could be heard. Care {{had to be}} taken during the war over <b>showing</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> at night as it was not unknown for a German soldier to simply shoot at a lit window.|$|R

6000|$|... "This to Evan Morgans, gentleman, at Mr. Leigh's {{house in}} Moorwinstow, Devonshire. News may be had by {{one who will}} go to the shore of Clovelly, any evening after the 25th of November, at dead low tide, and there watch for a boat, rowed by one with a red beard, and a Portugal by his speech. If he be asked, 'How many?' he will answer, 'Eight hundred and one.' Take his letters and read them. If the shore be watched, let him who comes <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> three times in a safe place under the cliff above the town; below is {{dangerous}} landing. Farewell, and expect great things!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt some {{of their}} comrades in the other barque, or people from the village, <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> out there to guide them in. Besides, the wind is {{favourable}} to them and against us. No, young sir, {{there is nothing to}} do but to wait. In the morning, if there are but few of them, we will try to break through and gain the sea. If there are many we will fight here, as then all hands will be available for the combat, while if we were rowing, half of them would be occupied with the oars. If your lad were to go as he proposes he might {{fall into the hands of}} the enemy, and as the information he could gather would be in any case of no use, it is best he should remain where he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{the passage}} between our {{point and the}} island were but a bit wider, it would be perfect; but {{unfortunately}} it is so narrow {{that it is only}} on the very darkest night one can hope to get through, unnoticed. However, we can do very well with the southern channel and, after all, it is safer. We can get any number of boats, and the Henriette has only to anchor half a mile outside the entrance. We know when she is coming, and have but to <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>light,</b> directly she makes her signal, and the boats will put out from Radhorn passage and Hamworth; while messengers start for Bushaw, and Scopland, and Creach, and a dozen farmhouses, and the carts are sure to be at the spot where they had been warned to assemble, by the time the boats come along with the kegs; and everything is miles away, in hiding, before morning.|$|E
