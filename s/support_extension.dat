Six principles are identified: public goods, competitive advantage, privatization, long-run sustainability, business practices, and political economy.

It provides model spaces to distinguish and integrate modeling languages, models, and instances of models. Each model space can only instantiate classes defined from the immediate upper level model space.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, many ICT {{projects}} in Indian agriculture have emerged, which either substitute or <b>support</b> <b>extension</b> services by enabling farmers' access to information. Information that is context specific to farmers' local situations can have important farm outcomes.

This paper develops a content development and management process framework, which is applied to six well-known ICT projects in Indian agriculture. Despite differences in scale, mechanisms of delivery {{and the extent of}} content localization, all projects use a network of experts in relevant fields to provide content. Yet, their collective knowledge cannot be tapped easily across the different platforms. To mainstream such ICT efforts and knowledge management in agriculture for rural livelihoods, a centralized search engine to access the dispersed agricultural information and network of experts is thus suggested...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} a local {{probabilistic}} model for {{low cycle fatigue}} (LCF) based on the statistical size effect has been developed and applied on engineering components. Here, the notch <b>support</b> <b>extension</b> based on the stress gradient effect is described in detail, {{as well as an}} FEA-based parameter calibration. An FEA is necessary to simulate non-homogeneous stress fields in non-smooth specimens which exhibit gradients and determine size effects. The hazard density approach and the surface integration over the FEA stress lead to geometry-independent model parameters. Three different materials (superalloys IN- 939, Rene 80, steel 26 NiCrMoV 14 - 5) and three different geometry types (smooth, notch, cooling hole specimens) are considered for a more comprehensive validation of the probabilistic LCF model and to demonstrate its wide application range. At the same time, a reduced testing effort is needed compared to deterministic model predictions with notch support. Comment: 31 Pages, 11 Figure...|$|E
