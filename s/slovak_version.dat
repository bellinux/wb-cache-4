They then worked on the whole thing together, re-writing it six times. Neumann's aide, Oscar Krasniansky, an {{engineer}} and stenographer who later took the name Oskar Isaiah Karmiel, translated it from Slovak into German {{with the help of}} Gisela Steiner. They produced a 40-page report in German, which was completed by Thursday, 27 April 1944. Vrba wrote that the report was also translated into Hungarian.

He wrote that he recalled Oscar Krasniansky of the Slovak Jewish Council, who translated the report into German, arguing that only actual deaths should be recorded, and not speculation, to lend the report maximum credibility. Vrba speculated {{that this was the}} reason Krasniansky omitted the references to Hungary from the German translation, which was the version that was copied around the world.|$|E

500|$|The {{name that}} became common in travel books and other {{literature}} in the 19th century, however, is its current name, linking the mountain {{to the village of}} Gerlachov at its foot. It echoed the oldest known undifferentiated reference to the peaks on or near Gerlachov's municipal lands, Gerlachfalvenses montes (Latin with Hungarian elements for the [...] "Gerlachov Village Mountains"), in a drawing of the High Tatras from 1717. It also paralleled the name Gerlsdorfer Spitze (Gerlachov Peak) used by the first person to identify it as the highest peak in the Tatras in 1838 (see below), which was rendered as gerlachovský chochol (Gerlach crest) in a <b>Slovak</b> <b>version</b> of his report in 1851.

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to examine}} the relationship between team success and team cohesiveness with a sample of elite youth sport teams. The secondary aim of this international thesis was to translate and analyze the psychometric properties of responses to the Czech and <b>Slovak</b> <b>versions</b> of the Youth Sport Environment Questionnaire (YSEQ; Eys, Loughead, Bray, & Carron, 2009 b) in a sample of elite youth handball and soccer players. The accomplishment of the second purpose involved three phases of research. First, the questionnaire was translated into the Czech and Slovak languages by method of parallel back-translation. In Phase 2, feedback was sought on the translated versions of each questionnaire from both researchers (N = 2) and athletes (N = 52) to ensure the clarity of the instructions and the readability of the items. Subsequent confirmatory analyses in the final phase provided an adequate fitting model for both Czech and <b>Slovak</b> <b>versions</b> with an independent sample (N = 352) from youth sport teams. These results offer further support to Eys et al. 's (2009 b) proposed two dimensional model underlying their measure of cohesion for youth sport groups.

40|$|Background: We {{discuss the}} {{countries}} that have liberalized legislation on the possession of small amounts of marijuana and other drugs, and explore the justifications that inclined authorities to introduce such changes. The Czech Republic is among these countries. We compared the prevailing opinions on this issue by conducting surveys among young people living in Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. Material/Methods: The data were collected {{with the help of}} Polish, Czech, and <b>Slovak</b> <b>versions</b> of the questionnaire. The data were acquired during 3 focus studies organized at the Department of Health Care, University of Trenčín, Slovakia, the Department of Health Care Studies, Tomas Bata University, Zlin, Czech Republic, and the Institute of Nursing, University of Applies Sciences, Nysa, Poland. We gathered the answers from 27 students of nursing in Zlin, from 43 students in Trenčín, and 33 students in Nysa. Results: It appears that even in the Czech Republic, many young people disagree with the liberalization of legislation for the possession of small amounts of drugs. The proportion of young Polish students who do not positively assess such legislation is similar. In Slovakia, young people overwhelmingly judge such legislation negatively. Conclusions: 1. The lack of social approval for the legal possession of small amounts of marijuana makes it difficult to fight dangerous “new psychoactive substances”. 2. Since many young people in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia does not approve of the liberalization of legislation on possessing small amounts of marijuana and other drugs, it is necessary to verify the hypotheses explaining the nature of these prejudices. © Med Sci Tech, 2016...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the anniversary of Professor Viktor Krupa – the known Slovak ethnographer and linguist. The object of the {{analysis}} was the name {{of one of the most}} popular books of Hero of the day – Za siedmimi morami („Over the seven seas“), which seems to be characteristic for the author’s biography. This excpression is included in the Slavic proverbs and sayings with the concept of „sea“. In this case, although the idiom za siedmimi morami is not fixed by any phrasebook or by the majority of monolingual and bilingual dictionaries of the Slovak language, it is widely known in colloquial speech and is often used in modern Slovak literature and the media. In the cited contexts, the expression retains its folk stylistic flavor, which often emphasizes the typical folk-poetic speech „increments“ to its meaning and rhythm, reinforcing the semantics of „remoteness“: za siedmimi ostrovmi a za siedmimi morami, za siedmimi horami a siedmimi morami etc. This variation suggested by the presence of <b>Slovak</b> folklore explicate <b>version</b> of our expression, where the numerical component of the „seven“ is replaced by „nine“ – za deviatimi horami, za siedmimi morami...|$|R
