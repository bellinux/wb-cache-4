2500|$|Combination of {{structural}} elements of ACh and nicotine {{as well as}} reducing the conformational flexibility by using a cyclopropane ring {{has led to the}} discovery of potent and selective α4β2 nAChR ligands. The modulation of three structural elements, the linker, substitution on the amino group and the pyridine ring can be used to determine the influence on potency and selectivity of the ligands. Factors that decrease the binding are steric hindrance on the amino group and linkers that are saturated/unsaturated carbon chains. <b>Short-chained</b> ether linkers are preferred. [...] Beneficial effects on the binding is seen with substitution on the pyridine ring both mono- and disubstitution with halogens among other groups. Substitution on the amino group with three different amides increased the binding affinity where methylamide had the highest binding. Lower binding in the other substituted amides was explained by steric hindrance or lack of a methyl group resulting in loss of hydrophobic interaction. Stereochemistry of pyridine nitrogen and/or the pyridine ring and its stereoelectronic effects has a subtle beneficial effect on the binding to the α4β2 nAChR. Thus it was shown that a pyridyl ether ligand with bromo substitution on the pyridine and metylatedamide on the amino group had the highest potency.|$|E

30|$|Considering {{that the}} {{exposure}} to <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs {{is unlikely to be}} stopped shortly, there will be increasing continuous and poorly reversible environmental background concentrations of <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs. Consequently, organisms and humans will be permanently exposed to <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs, resulting in continuous and poorly reversible internal concentrations. The poorly reversible internal concentrations in organisms are caused by the persistence of <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs and their continuous presence in the environment. Therefore, the organismal elimination efficiencies are of secondary relevance. This becomes more evident when considering that the half-lives of <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs in the environment exceed their half-lives in the organisms by far. Cousins et al. [41] addresses this approach in more detail, showing exemplary that the contamination of drinking water resources with <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs leads to a poorly reversible exposure in humans, comparably to a contamination with long-chain PFAAs. Due to the high mobility of <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs and the missing suitable water treatment technologies for drinking water, <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs will remain in the water resources over time (this scenario proves true, see “Case example Rastatt”).

30|$|Long- and <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs were {{originally}} distinguished, since <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs {{are assumed to}} have a lower bioaccumulation potential and improved environmental properties compared to long-chain PFAAs [3, 18]. However, <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs are as persistent as long-chain PFAAs have different, but not less alarming properties of concern, and are already widely distributed in the environment [e.g., 19 – 27]. The awareness of these concerns needs to be raised to obtain a fast regulation of <b>short-chain</b> PFASs. Therefore, this study (i) summarizes and highlights the concerns of <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs, (ii) investigates {{the need for a}} regulation and (iii) provides a strategy for how a regulation could be implemented in REACH.|$|R

Smaller molecules such as isobutane and propylene or butylenes can be recombined to meet specific octane requirements by processes such as alkylation, or more commonly, dimerization. The octane grade of gasoline can also be improved by catalytic reforming, which involves removing hydrogen from hydrocarbons producing compounds with higher octane ratings such as aromatics. Intermediate products such as gasoils can even be reprocessed to break a heavy, long-chained oil into a lighter <b>short-chained</b> one, by various forms of cracking such as fluid catalytic cracking, thermal cracking, and hydrocracking. The final step in gasoline production is the blending of fuels with different octane ratings, vapor pressures, and other properties to meet product specifications.

We observed that administration of <b>short-chain</b> fatty acids to rat breeders via drinking water prior to pregnancy and further treatment of the offspring with <b>short-chain</b> fatty acids after weaning led to disease amelioration. In contrast, rats that were administered <b>short-chain</b> fatty acids beginning at weaning were not protected from type 1 diabetes. <b>Short-chain</b> fatty acid therapy exerted a profound effect on the intestinal microbiome in the offspring reflected by a reduction and an increase in the abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes taxa, respectively, on day 5 post-infection, and reversed virus-induced alterations in certain bacterial taxa. Principal component analysis and permutation multivariate analysis of variance tests further revealed that <b>short-chain</b> fatty acids induce a distinct intestinal microbiota compared with uninfected animals or rats that receive the virus only. <b>Short-chain</b> fatty acids downregulated Kilham Rat Virus-induced proinflammatory responses in the intestine. Finally, <b>short-chain</b> fatty acids altered the B and T cell compartments in Peyer's patches.

30|$|The {{determination}} of the physicochemical properties of <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs requires, due to the unusual substance properties, specific methods. Estimates of the physicochemical properties are available (PFBS, PFBA and PFHxA [42, 43]: logKow (neutral form) =  2.82 – 4.6, water solubility >  20  g/L, logKoa =  6 – 6.7, pKa <  1, logKoc: 2.7 – 3.6), showing that <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs are very mobile, which is also confirmed by their environmental distribution [44, 45]. Due to this mobility <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs effectively reach water bodies which is of special concern regarding human exposure: Drinking water resources are highly sensitive to contamination with <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs [19, 46]. Due to the low adsorption potential, <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs will not bind to particles and stay mainly dissolved in the water phase.|$|R
30|$|Nevertheless, {{elimination}} half-lives of <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs are non-negligible: Depending on the species, {{they range}} {{from a couple of}} hours to several days in some mammals [58 – 60], with longer half-lives in humans (e.g., 30  days for PFHxA [61]). The elimination half-lives are shorter compared to some long-chain homologues, but nevertheless of concern, as <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs will still remain in organisms with continuous exposure. Some <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs have considerable protein binding potentials [62, 63]. A high protein binding potential is of toxicokinetical relevance: the blood can easily distribute <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs within the body resulting in a potential to enrich particularly in blood rich tissues. Data from the exposure of mammals show that <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs can be widely distributed in the organism [64, 65].|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe physico-chemical {{properties}} of <b>short-chain</b> phosphatidylcholine are reviewed {{to the extent}} that its biological activity as a mild detergent can be rationalized. Long-chain diacylphosphatidylcholines are typical membrane phospholipids that form preferentially smectic lamellar phases (bilayers) when dispersed in water. In contrast, the preferred phase of the <b>short-chain</b> analogues dispersed in excess water is the micellar phase. The preferred conformation and the dynamics of <b>short-chain</b> phosphatidylcholines in the monomeric and micellar state present in H 2 O are discussed. The motionally averaged conformation of <b>short-chain</b> phosphatidylcholines is then compared to the single-crystal structures of membrane lipids. The main conclusion emerging is that in terms of preferred conformation and motional averaging <b>short-chain</b> phosphatidylcholines closely resemble their long-chain analogues. The dispersing power of <b>short-chain</b> phospholipids is emphasized {{in the second part of}} the review. Evidence is presented to show that this class of compounds is superior to most other detergents used in the solubilization of membrane proteins and the reconstitution of the solubilized proteins to artificial membrane systems (proteoliposomes). The prominent feature of the solubilization/reconstitution of integral membrane proteins by <b>short-chain</b> PC is the retention of the native protein structure and hence the protein function.

The retention of the native protein structure in the solubilized state, i. e. in mixed micelles consisting of the integral membrane protein, intrinsic membrane lipids and <b>short-chain</b> PC, is rationalized. It is hypothesized that <b>short-chain</b> PC interacts primarily with the lipid bilayer of a membrane and very little if at all with the membrane proteins.

30|$|In the {{surroundings}} of Rastatt (Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany), 480 hectares of former arable land are contaminated with <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs and precursors. The pollution was detected in 2013 and {{has probably been}} caused by the longstanding application of compost mixed with sludge from paper production, contaminated with various precursors. Over time, the precursors contained in the soil degraded to <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs and were enriched in plants. Local authorities derived thresholds for <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs in food (in the µg/kg range) [72], based on guidance values for drinking water [73]. Pre-harvest monitoring showed that the concentration of <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs in some crops exceeded these thresholds, preventing the use as food. Crops enriching high amounts of <b>short-chain</b> PFASs are recommended not to be cultivated for consumption on these contaminated fields (e.g.,asparaguses, strawberries and other vegetables). Despite the recommendations for cultivation, threshold values are in parts exceeded to date. This {{might be due to}} a strong influence of insufficiently predictable abiotic factors, such as organic carbon content, on the enrichment of <b>short-chain</b> PFASs in plants [74]. Over time, the very mobile <b>short-chain</b> PFASs and precursors in the soil also wash out into the groundwater.

30|$|According to the {{publicly}} available information on REACH registrations, <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs, e.g., PFBA (perfluorobutanoic acid), PFBS (perfluorobutanesulfonic acid) and PFHxA (perfluorohexanoic acid) have not been registered so far. The last registration deadline under REACH for substances which are manufactured or imported between one and 100 tons per year is 31 May 2018. However, registration obligations do not include substances in imported articles. In contrast to the <b>short-chain</b> PFAAs, various <b>short-chain</b> precursor substances are registered in high tonnages (>  100 tons per annum) and are mainly used for manufacturing polymers. Those polymers may most likely have wide dispersive uses. In general, <b>short-chain</b> PFASs can substitute long-chain PFASs in manifold applications [28]. Therefore, they are used comparably to long-chain PFASs in many consumer products and industrial applications requiring inert or repellent characteristics. Due to a partially limited technical performance in comparison with long-chain PFASs, higher amounts of <b>short-chain</b> PFASs are usually used in compensation (e.g., in wax and polish) [28]. During the production and life cycle of the products, inevitably releases of <b>short-chain</b> PFASs into the aquatic and terrestrial environment occur [29].

Additionally, the degradation of side-chain fluorinated polymers might contribute significantly to emissions of <b>short-chain</b> PFASs in the long-term, as demonstrated by an environmental fate modeling analysis by Li et al.
