Though Lemurés still had a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>peace</b> and paradise, in spite of Yarhi attacks, it was a false paradise due to the Aurcite draining the Aegyl of their anima as part of Feolthanos' plan to destroy Ivalice as revenge against the Occurians.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} grounds are, {{except in}} drier climates, grass {{covered with a}} floral border around the headstones. There is also an absence of any paving between the headstone rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>peace.</b> However, Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and sanitises {{the nature of the}} war deaths.|$|E
25|$|St Paul's has {{aesthetic}} significance as {{a highly}} picturesque church, employing asymmetry, heavy massing, high quality brickwork, semi-circular forms and simplified ornamentation. The interior, with its dark brickwork and prominent timber roof trusses, evokes a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>peace</b> and spiritual shelter. The internal and external elements of St Paul's combine to create a cohesive and finely detailed whole.|$|E

500|$|Commission cemeteries are {{distinctive}} {{in treating}} floriculture {{as an integral}} part of the cemetery design. Originally, the horticultural concept was to create an environment where visitors could experience a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>peace</b> in a setting, in contrast to traditionally bleak graveyards. [...] Recommendations given by Arthur William Hill, the Assistant Director of the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew enabled the Commission to develop cemetery layouts and architectural structures that took into account the placement of suitable plant life. Combining structural and horticultural elements was not unfamiliar to the Commission's architects. Sir Edwin Lutyens furthered his long-standing working relationship with horticulturist Gertrude Jekyll, whose devotion to traditional cottage garden plants and roses greatly influenced the appearance of the cemeteries. [...] Where possible, indigenous plants were utilised to enhance sentimental associations with the gardens of home.|$|E
500|$|Tolle recalls {{going out}} for a walk in London the next morning, and finding that “everything was miraculous, deeply peaceful. Even the traffic." [...] The feeling continued, and he began to feel a strong {{underlying}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>peace</b> in any situation. He stopped studying for his doctorate, and for a period of about two years after this he spent much of his time sitting, “in a state of deep bliss," [...] on park benches in Russell Square, Central London, [...] "watching the world go by.” He stayed with friends, in a Buddhist monastery, or otherwise slept rough on Hampstead Heath. His family thought him “irresponsible, even insane." [...] He changed his first name from Ulrich to Eckhart; by some reports this was in homage to the German philosopher and mystic, Meister Eckhart. A 2012 interview article states that he saw the name Eckhart on one of a pile of books in a dream, and knew he had written the book; soon after in real life he ran into a psychic friend who called him Eckhart out of nowhere, so he changed his name.|$|E

2500|$|As a peacemaker, Darius is {{described}} as loving and compassionate. The Watcher Chronicle observes, [...] "there is a quality in the man that I've seen in no other, a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>peace</b> - perhaps even a sense of God." [...] In Shadow of Obsession, Joe Dawson states, [...] "All the reports mention the sense of sanctity, the aura of peace that surrounded him." [...] Darius considers peace the highest human value and is always shocked and saddened by unnecessary death. The script of [...] "Band of Brothers" [...] has him say: [...] "In the face of violence, we must insist on nonviolence... Weapons have no dominion over the souls of men. Put your weapons down." [...] He is actively involved in promoting and maintaining peace, [...] "preaching his message {{to those who would}} become the peacemakers of their own generations," [...] such as Victor Paulus. He also uses less obvious means such as using MacLeod (who has not rejected violence) to protect Paulus, or planting a spy in Grayson's organization.|$|E

And they passed." [...] Jackson also felt that the couple's relationship was crucial to Lucky's growth and acceptance of his parents, stating to Soaps In Depth in 1999: [...] "I think it was through that relationship and that love that Lucky obtained a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>peace</b> that made him want to mend things with his parents more. I don't think he would have done it otherwise." [...] When Jackson left the series in April 1999, Lucky and Elizabeth's teenage romance ends as Lucky is presumed dead in a fire. The couple attempts reconciliation from 2000 to 2002 during Jacob Young's tenure, and reunites in 2005 while Greg Vaughan played the role. Lucky and Elizabeth have an on-and-off relationship throughout the years that includes marriages, infidelity and children. Herbst explained portraying the relationship through different actors to Comcast in 2010: [...] "The characters are still the same. Each individual actor chose to play him a little differently. You just roll with it. Each relationship was different. They all had their uniqueness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nursing {{professionals}} work in {{a stressful}} environment. According to a report conducted at Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network (LVHHN), nurses {{are at high risk}} for chronic burnout and stress. The nurse's roles are regarded as stress-filled based upon physical labor, human suffering, work hours, staffing, and interpersonal relationships. Work stress and burnout are significant concerns on both an individualistic and an organizational level. On an individualistic level, stress symptoms can contribute to health problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes. On an organizational level, work stress may lead to absenteeism and turnover, which impedes on the quality of care. According to a 2016 National Healthcare Retention & RN Staffing Report published by NSI Nursing Solutions, the national average turnover rate among nurses is 17.2%, a 0.8% increase from 2014. During the study, 27 nurses voluntarily participated in an 8-week-stress-reduction program called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Data analyses revealed that the MBSR program had significant benefits that could be categorized into two. “The early weeks of the training program conveyed that benefits were related to increased relaxation, slowing down, feeling a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>peace,</b> and learning to be in the present moment." [...] Results in the late weeks of the training program were linked to self-acceptance, self-awareness and self-care.|$|E

50|$|Two years pass, and in {{that time}} the natural world recedes, to be {{replaced}} by a bittersweet relationship with God and the Bible.

And yet at the same time, a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ineffable <b>peace,</b> the feeling <b>of</b> sins forgiven is felt.
