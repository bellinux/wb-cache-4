5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the molding cavity. This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of <b>sprues,</b> gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} thought that some medals {{made during the}} First World War were {{composed}} of metal captured from different Chinese guns during the Boxer Rebellion. This is not so, however. [...] The VCs examined by Creagh and Ashton [...] both in Australia (58) and at the QE II Army Memorial Museum in New Zealand (14) [...] spanned the entire time during which VCs have been issued and no compositional inconsistencies were found. It was also believed that another source of metal was used between 1942 and 1945 to create five Second World War VCs when the Sevastopol metal [...] "went missing". Creagh accessed the Army records at MoD Donnington in 1991 and {{did not find any}} gaps in the custodial record. The composition found in the WW2 VCs, amongst them those for Edwards (Australia) and Upham (New Zealand), is similar to that for the early WW1 medals. This is likely to be due to the reuse of material from earlier pourings, casting <b>sprues,</b> defective medals, etc.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} are the four steps in traditional die casting, also known as , these are also the basis {{for any of the}} die casting variations: die preparation, filling, ejection, and shakeout. The dies are prepared by spraying the mold cavity with lubricant. The lubricant both helps control the temperature of the die and it also assists in the removal of the casting. The dies are then closed and molten metal is injected into the dies under high pressure; between [...] Once the mold cavity is filled, the pressure is maintained until the casting solidifies. The dies are then opened and the shot (shots are different from castings because there can be multiple cavities in a die, yielding multiple castings per shot) is ejected by the ejector pins. Finally, the shakeout involves separating the scrap, which includes the gate, runners, <b>sprues</b> and flash, from the shot. This is often done using a special trim die in a power press or hydraulic press. Other methods of shaking out include sawing and grinding. A less labor-intensive method is to tumble shots if gates are thin and easily broken; separation of gates from finished parts must follow. This scrap is recycled by remelting it. The yield is approximately 67%.|$|E

50|$|In casting, a <b>sprue</b> is {{the passage}} through which a molten {{material}} is introduced into a mold, and the term also {{refers to the}} excess material which solidifies in the <b>sprue</b> passage.

50|$|Another cost {{advantage}} with rotational molding is the minimal {{amount of material}} wasted in production.

After the metal has cooled, the external ceramic or clay is chipped away, revealing {{an image of the}} wax form, including core pins, <b>sprues,</b> vents, and risers. All of these are removed with a saw and tool marks are polished away, and interior core material is removed to reduce the likelihood of interior corrosion. Incomplete voids created by gas pockets or investment inclusions are then corrected by welding and carving. Small defects where <b>sprues</b> and vents were attached are filed or ground down and polished.|$|E

40|$|Epithelial barrier {{function}} and ion transport was studied in coeliac <b>sprue</b> using a miniaturised Ussing device for measurements on diagnostic aspiration biopsy specimens from the jejunum of untreated or gluten free nourished <b>sprue</b> patients, or from healthy controls. Pure epithelial resistance (Re) indicating epithelial {{barrier function}} {{was determined by}} transmural alternating current impedance analysis. It was reduced by 56 % in acute <b>sprue</b> mean (SEM) (9 (1) omega. cm 2) compared with controls (20 (2) omega. cm 2). In gluten free nourished <b>sprue</b> patients Re was only partly recovered (15 (1) omega. cm 2). Subepithelial resistance (Rsub) was also changed from 28 (1) omega. cm 2 - in control to 17 (1) omega. cm 2 in acute <b>sprue</b> because {{of the change in}} mucosal architecture, but was unchanged in gluten free nourished <b>sprue</b> patients (29 (4) omega. cm 2). In acute <b>sprue,</b> unidirectional Na+ and Cl- fluxes were increased in both directions {{as a consequence of the}} decreased resistance. However, short circuit current (ISC) as well as Na+ and Cl- net fluxes were not significantly different from control. Subsequently, the electrogenic Cl- secretory system was investigated. After maximal stimulation with theophylline and prostaglandin E 1, a Cl(-) -dependent increase in ISC was obtained in the <b>sprue</b> mucosa and control jejunum. It showed saturation characteristics and was blockable by serosal bumetanide. When compared with control, neither Km nor Vmax of this electrogenic Cl- secretion was significantly changed in coeliac <b>sprue.</b> In conclusion, a miniaturised Ussing device was used for transport measurements on intestinal biopsy specimens.
