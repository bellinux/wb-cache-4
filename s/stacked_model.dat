In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of IPMC, a chemical deposition method was utilized to manufacture IPMC with silver electrodes (Ag-IPMC), and methods of ion exchange and ionic liquid penetration were adopted to conduct modified treatment for original IPMC. Additionally, the stacking performance of IPMC, which was disposed by ionic liquid penetration after the modified treatment, was analyzed. Results showed that: Ag-IPMC, which was modified by treating in 2 mol/L LiCl solution for three hours, presented the optimal performance. Also, the IPMC after modified treatment by ionic liquid penetration swung longer in air, and its tip output displacement was stable at five millimeter; without any change with time. Furthermore, the <b>stacked</b> <b>model</b> of IPMC decreased the excursion of center {{in the process of}} swinging, and it also increased the output force of IPMC.

40|$|Collective {{classification}} techniques jointly infer all class labels of a {{relational data}} set, using the inferences about one class label to influence inferences about related class labels. Typical collective classification schemes use computationally-intensive iterative algorithms or approximate joint inference techniques. Kou and Cohen recently introduced an efficient relational model based on stacking that, despite its simplicity, performs equivalently to more sophisticated joint inference approaches. This stacked relational model trains on the inferred labels of related instances, {{instead of the}} true labels which are not typically present at inference time. This permits the use of efficient exact inference in place of more computationally-intensive approximate joint inference. There {{are at least two}} possible causes for the unexpected high performance of the stacked approach: a reduction in inference bias (resulting from training on inferred rather than true labels) or a reduction in inference variance (due to the use of exact rather than approximate inference). Using experiments on both real and synthetic data, we show that the primary cause for the performance of the <b>stacked</b> <b>model</b> is the reduction in bias from learning the <b>stacked</b> <b>model</b> on inferred labels rather than the true labels. The reduction in variance due to conditional inference also contributes to the effect but it is not as strong. In addition, we show that the performance of the joint inference and stacked learners can be attributed to an implicit weighting of local and relational features at learning time. ...|$|E

40|$|To date, {{there are}} no {{international}} codes or standards that deal with estimation offatigue in subsea wellhead systems. Nevertheless have preliminary analytical methodsfor wellhead fatigue estimation been established. These analytical methods involve theuse of global dynamic response analyses. Such analyses are commonly carried out innite element software where the drilling system is modelled as beam or bar elements. Several uncertainties exist {{in regards to the}} mathematical modelling and simulationin global response analyses of drilling systems. In this thesis the uncertainties thatare related to the goodness of the representation of the blowout preventer stack (BOPstack), are addressed. An overview of previous and ongoing work on analytical estimation of wellhead fatigue isgiven. Relevant theory on the subject is presented and described. The theory comprisesof fatigue on structures, loads on a drilling system and static and dynamic responseanalysis. The main features of the preliminary analytical methods for estimating wellhead fatigue are summarized. The BOP stack is commonly assumed to have innitely high stiness when performinga global response analysis of a drilling system. The main objective in the thesis is toinvestigate if this is a good assumption. The investigation start with local modellingof an elastic beam element model of a BOP stack. Further, this elastic beam model iscalibrated to have the same stiness properties as a detailed 3 D element <b>model</b> of theBOP <b>stack.</b> The calibrated elastic beam BOP <b>stack</b> <b>model</b> is implemented in a globalmodel of a drilling system.

The eects of BOP <b>stack</b> <b>modelling</b> areevaluated with regards to estimated fatigue damage in the wellhead. In addition to this main study, parameter studies and a sensitivity study are carried out to evaluateuncertainties and assumptions within a realistic frame. The results from the wellhead fatigue assessments conclude that the elastic BOP stackmodel imposes greater estimated fatigue damage in the wellhead compared to theinnitely sti BOP <b>stack</b> <b>model.</b> The dierence, in terms of estimated fatigue damage,imposed by the two BOP <b>stack</b> <b>models</b> is, at maximum, 0. 51 % for the main study.

40|$|SYNOPSIS During tunnel {{construction}} in fractured rock, a detailed hydrogeological {{description of the}} rock is of importance for successful grouting design and estimating leakage. A common simplification has been to assume the fractures as independent parallel plates; a 2 D <b>stacked</b> <b>model.</b> However, analytical inflow predictions based on this model have not been sufficiently accurate. The aim of this work is to study whether a more realistic 3 D fracture model, viewing the fracture system as a network of connected fractures, could better explain the sealing effects of grout compared to the 2 D model. Inflow into a tunnel and grout penetration have been studied in a three-fracture network model, using the numerical groundwater flow code DarcyTools, version 3. 1. Ideas developed from this study were then applied to a real case tunnel. Deviations from the analytical prediction of inflow into the grouted tunnel can be understood, in part at least, by taking the connectivity of the rock volume into account. The results further enhance the importance of firm geological and hydrogeological characterization of the rock mass {{that needs to be}} sealed with grout to reach a tolerable inflow of groundwater...|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} both classical and quantum geometric frustrated Ising models with a competing ordering mechanism is {{reported in this}} paper. The ordering comes in the classical case from a coupling of 2 D layers and in the quantum model from the quantum dynamics induced by a transverse field. By mapping the Ising models on a triangular lattice to elastic lattices of non-crossing strings, we derive an exact relation between the spin variables and the displacement field of the strings. Using this map both for the classical (2 + 1) D <b>stacked</b> <b>model</b> and the quantum frustrated 2 D system, we obtain a microscopic derivation of an effective Hamiltonian which was proposed before on phenomenological grounds within a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach.

40|$|Information {{technology}} research {{over the}} past two decades suggests that the installation and use of computers fundamentally affects the structure and function of organisations and, m particular, the workers in these organizations. Following the release of the IBM Personal Computer in 1982, microcomputers have become an integral part of most work environments. The accounting services industry, in particular, has felt the impact of this ‘microcomputer revolution’. In Big Six accounting firms, there is almost one microcomputer for each professional accountant employed, Notwithstanding this, little research has been done on the effect of microcomputers on the work outcomes of professional accountants working in these firms. This study addresses this issue. It assesses, in an organisational setting, how accountant’ perceptions of ease of use and usefulness of microcomputers act on their computer anxieties, microcomputer attitudes and use to affect their job satisfaction and job performance. The research also examines how different types of human-computer interfaces affect the relationships between accountants 2 ̆ 7 beliefs about microcomputer utility and ease of use, computer anxiety, microcomputer attitudes and microcomputer use. To attain this research objective, a conceptual model was first developed, The model indicates that work outcomes (job satisfaction and job performance) of professional accountants using microcomputers are influenced by users 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of ease of use and usefulness of microcomputers via paths through (a) the level of computer anxiety experienced by users, (b) the general attitude of users toward using microcomputers, and (c) the extent to which microcomputers are used by individuals. Empirically testable propositions were derived from the model to test the postulated relationships between these constructs. The study also tested whether or not users of different human-computer interfaces reacted differently to the perceptions and anxieties they hold about microcomputers and their use in the workplace. It was argued that users of graphical interfaces, because of the characteristics of those interfaces, react differently to their perceptions and anxieties about microcomputers compared with users of command-line (or textual-based) interfaces. A passive-observational study in a field setting was used to test the model and the research propositions. Data was collected from 164 professional accountants working in a Big Six accounting firm in a metropolitan city in Australia. Structural equation modelling techniques were used to test the, hypothesised causal relationships between the components comprising the general research model. Path analysis and ordinary least squares regression was used to estimate the parameters of the model and analyse the data obtained. Multisample analysis (or <b>stacked</b> <b>model</b> analysis) using EQS was used to test the fit of the model to the data of the different human-computer interface groups and to estimate the parameters for the paths in those different groups. The results show that the research model is a good description of the data. The job satisfaction of professional accountants is directly affected by their attitude toward using microcomputers and by microcomputer use itself. However, job performance appears to be only directly affected by microcomputer attitudes. Microcomputer use does not directly affect job performance. Along with perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, computer anxiety is shown to be an important determinant of attitudes toward using microcomputers - higher levels of computer anxiety negatively affect attitudes toward using microcomputers. Conversely, higher levels of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness heighten individuals 2 ̆ 7 positive attitudes toward using microcomputers. Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness also indirectly affect microcomputer attitudes through their effect on computer anxiety. The results show that higher levels of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness result in lower levels of computer anxiety. A surprising result from the study is that while perceived ease of use is shown to directly affect the level of microcomputer usage, perceived usefulness and attitude toward using microcomputers does not. The results of the multisample analysis confirm that the research model fits the <b>stacked</b> <b>model</b> and that the <b>stacked</b> <b>model</b> is a significantly better fit if specific parameters are allowed to vary between the two human-computer interface user groups. In general, these results confirm that an interaction exists between the type of human-computer interface (the variable providing the grouping) and the other variables in the model The results show a clear difference between the two groups in the way in which perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness affect microcomputer attitude. In the case of users of command-line interfaces, these variables appear to affect microcomputer attitude via an intervening variable, computer anxiety, whereas in the graphical interface user group the effect occurs directly. Related to this, the results show that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness have a significant direct effect on computer anxiety in command-line interface users, but no effect at all for graphical interface users. Of the two exogenous variables only perceived ease of use, and that in the case of the command-line interface users, has a direct significant effect on extent of use of microcomputers. In summary, the research has contributed to the development of a theory of individual adjustment to information technology in the workplace. It identifies certain perceptions, anxieties and attitudes about microcomputers and shows how they may affect work outcomes such as job satisfaction and job performance. It also shows that microcomputer-interface types have a differential effect on some of the hypothesised relationships represented in the general model. Future replication studies could sample a broader cross-section of the microcomputer user community. Finally, the results should help Big Six accounting firms to maximise the benefits of microcomputer use by making them aware of how working with microcomputers affects job satisfaction and job performance...|$|E

Overall, the combined system formed via stacking ("FAUST") performed well in the BioNLP 2011 shared task. The FAUST system obtained 1 st place in three out of four tasks: 1 st place in Genia Task 1 (56. 0 % F 1) and Task 2 (53. 9 %), 2 nd place in the Epigenetics and Post-translational Modifications track (35. 0 %), and 1 st place in the Infectious Diseases track (55. 6 %). Conclusion We present a state-of-the-art event extraction system that relies on the strengths of structured prediction and model combination through stacking. Akin to results on other tasks, stacking outperforms intersection and union and leads to very strong results. The utility of model combination hinges on complementary views of the data, and we show that our sub-systems capture different graph properties of event structures.

Among these the most studied is certainly cis-diamminodichloroplatinum(II), or cisplatin, which after an activation process, attacks DNA in guanine-rich regions leading {{to strong distortion}} of DNA structure. Theoretical and experimental works suggest 7 t-stacking disruption and GC pair distortion as the most relevant effects. In this work, ab initio and DFT calculations are extensively employed in order to explore the role of basic forces in DNA and metal-DNA adducts. To do so, Atoms in Molecules (AIM) theory {{has been used as}} a tool to decompose binding energies into contributions of covalent bond, H-bond and rc-stack energies, leading to a clearer picture of the studied systems. Firstly, DFT methods were employed to investigate the hydrolysis mechanism of cisplatin, a key step in the activation of the drug. Subsequently, an ADM based approach has been proposed to estimate H-bond energies in metal-DNA complexes. This allowed us to investigate the effect of platination on GC pair and, more generally, the role of H-bonding in such systems. A large study of transition metal- purine complexes, from Ti to Hg, has been discussed, providing a systematic analysis of the effect of metallation on the GC pair. As well as H-bonding, 7 c-stacking plays a fundamental role in DNA and metal-DNA structures. In order to avoid use of expensive and, in certain cases, prohibitive methods such as MP 2 and CCSD calculations, a new hybrid DFT functional, BHandH, has been applied to <b>stacked</b> <b>model</b> complexes (from benzene to DNA nucleobases). In addition, AIM analysis was shown to be useful tool in estimating it-stacking interactions in these systems. Thus, QM/MM calculations (QM = BHandH, MM = AMBER) were employed in order to investigate the role of H-bonding and -stacking in DNA and cisplatin-DNA adducts, the interplay between those being our main focus. One example of realistic platinated octamer was also studied with the BH&H/AMBER/AIM approach, leading to general agreement with experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 In {{this paper}} I {{demonstrate}} that theories which postulate a strict tree structure of discourse {{on either the}} intentional or attentional level are not totally adequate for handling spontaneous dialogues. I use as evidence analyses {{of the structure of}} multiple headed negotiations. These are negotiation dialogues in which multiple suggestions are being negotiated at once. The question I explore in this paper is how to characterize the structure of a discourse in which multiple non-embedded adjacency pairs are initiated within a single turn since it is unclear in these cases how response parts are matched up with their corresponding initiating parts if discourse is tree structured. I argue that each non-embedded initiating part exists on a separate thread of the discourse so that an initiating part can be matched with its corresponding response part on its own thread. I develop my theory for the structure of these dialogues in the spirit of (GS 86) and (Loc 94). I support my claim that discourse is structured as a tapestry of interwoven threads by demonstrating that discourse level parallel structure makes it necessary to model attentional state as a graph structured stack rather than as a simple stack in order to make correct predictions about which discourse entities are readily available for pronominal reference, particularly with deictic pronouns like 2 ̆ 7 that 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 those 2 ̆ 7. I demonstrate that the graph structured <b>stack</b> <b>model</b> is a generalization of the simple <b>stack</b> <b>model</b> and therefore covers all of the phenomena covered by the simple <b>stack</b> <b>model</b> in addition to the data discussed in this paper which is problematic for the simple <b>stack</b> <b>model.</b> An implementation of this theory is discussed in (RELED 95). 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Parallel and T-shaped {{stacking}} interactions of the peptide plane with polar and ionizable amino acid side chains (including aspartic/glutamic acid, asparagine/glutamine, and arginine) are investigated using the quantum mechanical MP 2 and CCSD computational methods. It is {{found that the}} electrostatic interaction plays {{an essential role in}} determining the optimal stacking configurations for all investigated <b>stacking</b> <b>models.</b> For certain complexes, the dispersion interaction also contributes considerably to stacking. In the gas phase, the stacking interaction of the charged system is stronger than that of the neutral system, and T-shaped stacking is generally more preferred than parallel stacking, with the stacking energy in the range of 4 to - 18 kcal/mol. The solvation effect overall weakens stacking, especially for the charged system and the T-shaped stacking configurations. In water, the interaction energies of different <b>stacking</b> <b>models</b> are comparable. </p...|$|R
40|$|The <b>stack</b> <b>model</b> of {{execution}} uses a stack to hold temporary results during {{evaluation of a}} program. Implementations of the <b>stack</b> <b>model,</b> such as Java virtual machines for execution of stack-based Java bytecodes, can often access the stack more efficiently than local variables. Thus, converting local variable accesses into stack accesses can improve the performance of stack-based programs. We formulate a generic family of transformations on Java-like bytecodes that replaces loads and stores of local variables with equivalent operation sequences that avoid the loads and stores in favor of stack manipulation operations. We prove the correctness of these transformations, and argue that the resulting sequences are likely to yield improved performance by reducing memory traffic. We have implemented and evaluated several instances of the generic transformations for their effectiveness on code produced by Sun's javac Java-to-bytecode compiler.

40|$|The Java Bytecode {{language}} lacks expressiveness {{for traditional}} compiler optimizations, making this portable, secure software distribution format inefficient {{as a program}} representation for high performance. This inefficiency results from the underlying <b>stack</b> <b>model,</b> {{as well as the}} fact that many bytecode operations intrinsically include sub-operations (e. g., iaload includes the address computation, array bounds checks and the actual load of the array element). The <b>stack</b> <b>model,</b> with no operand registers and limiting access {{to the top of the}} stack, prevents the reuse of values and bytecode reordering. In addition, the bytecodes have no mechanism to indicate which sub-operations in the bytecode stream are redundant or subsumed by previous ones. As a consequence, the Java Bytecode language inhibits the expression of important compiler optimizations, including common sub-expression elimination, register allocation and instruction scheduling. The bytecode stream generated by the Java front [...] ...|$|R
