The joint of TiC-TiB 2 ceramic coating on <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>substrate</b> consisted of 3 -layer structures, i. e. the ceramic coating, the intermediate and <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>substrate,</b> and within the intermediate of Fe-Cr-Ni-Ti metallic matrix Ti-Fe enriched carbides decreased gradually both in volume fraction and particle size from the ceramic coating to <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>substrate</b> in the presence of atomic unidirectional diffusion of Ti and C, while some isolated α-Al 2 O 3 fine particles were also observed in the intermediate besides the presence of both some coarsened α-Al 2 O 3 inclusions nearby the ceramic coating and the barrier layers of Al 2 O 3 between the ceramic and the intermediate, so it is considered that the ceramic coating on <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>substrate</b> is achieved partially by fusion bonding due to the poor incompatibilities between Al 2 O 3 inclusions and the intermediate, resulting in the moderate shear strength of 125 ± 35 MPa between the ceramic coating and <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>substrate...</b>|$|E

This makes them very attractive as prosthetic replacements. Ultrafine HAp powder was obtained by milling elemental calcium phosphate mineral. The HAp powder was dispersed into isopropyl alcohol by ultrasonication and magnetic stirring. The HAp powder was deposited by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) using lead as anode and <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>substrate</b> as cathode. Powder was coated on <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>substrate</b> at a voltage of 60 volt and time was varying from 15 minutes to 1. 5 hours. It was observed that HAp powder deposited at 60 volt for 45 minute gives the best coating. In another set of experiment, coating time was 45 minutes having periodic time of 10 minutes with gap of 2 minutes. It was also observed that there is lack of adherence of powder particles with the substrate. To improve adherence of particles with substrate a surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS or NaDS) (C 12 H 25 SO 4 Na) was added during EPD process and subsequently sintering was performed at 8000 C for 2 hours in open atmosphere. X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows the peaks of HAp after deposition. It was observed from XRD spectra that XRD patterns of HAp powder that was prepared by planetary milling and HAp powder was deposited on <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>substrate</b> by EPD at 60 volts for 15 minutes. Here the some peaks of HAp are visible in the coated substrate along with peaks of stainless steel. The intensity of HAp peaks in the coated substrate is lesser than pure HAp powder.

30|$|Anodic electropolymerization {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the fabrication of polypyrrole films on <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>substrates</b> for application in ES. The method {{is based on the}} use of sodium salicylate and tiron anionic additives, which were incorporated into the polymer to ensure the electrical neutrality of the growing film and passivated the surface of the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>substrates.</b> The deposition yield can be controlled by the variation of deposition time at a constant current density. SEM studies showed the formation of porous films with film thickness in the range of 0 – 3 μm. The film morphology is influenced by the additives. The films prepared using tiron additive showed lower particles size and improved uniformity compared to the films prepared using sodium salicylate. CV data for the films tested in the 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solutions showed capacitive behavior and a high SC in the voltage window of 0.9 V. The films deposited from pyrrole solutions containing tiron showed better capacitive behavior compared to those deposited from the solutions containing sodium salicylate additive. A highest SC of 254 F g− 1 was observed for the sample with a specific mass of 89 μg cm− 2 at a scan rate of 2 mV s− 1. The SC decreased with an increasing film thickness and scan rate.
