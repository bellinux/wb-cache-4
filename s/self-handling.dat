50|$|During 2012, Air Uganda began <b>self-handling</b> at its hub at Entebbe International Airport and was {{authorised}} {{to handle}} any other airline that {{chose to use}} their handling services. The move saved the airline at least US$700,000 annually.|$|E
50|$|Rational {{economics}} agents tend towards substituting relatively {{cheaper and}} capital intensive manufactured goods for relatively {{more expensive and}} labor-intensive services. Consumers will use goods instead of services wherever economical and possible. By observing the emergence of automated teller machines instead of bank tellers, self-service gas stations instead of full-service stations, self-driving instead of chauffeurs, do-it-yourself pregnancy kits rather than hospital testing services, <b>self-handled</b> optical scanners rather than cashiers, and cloud computing instead of central mainframes, mature economies are entering the era of self-service, disintermediation and mass customization.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} formed in 1996, as the <b>self-handling</b> ground unit for the {{aircraft}} group Dairo Air Services. In 2002, DAS Handling Limited was granted a renewable, five-year, commercial operator's license. This authorization allowed the company to compete for services to other airlines outside its parent group. In May 2014, the company attained ACC3/RA3 European Union ground handling certification. In August 2014, DAS Handling Limited successfully completed the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Safety Audit for Ground Operations (ISAGO). Following that successful audit, the company became one of 154 ground service providers worldwide who had successfully registered under the IATA ISAGO programme at that time.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Autonomic {{monitoring}} procedures in multi-service networks provide not only feedback to end users, but also <b>self-handling</b> monitoring events to network operators. In this work, we present an autonomic monitoring framework for Quality of Service (QoS) management in multi-service networks. Our framework introduces aggregation mechanisms {{to deal with}} the excessive number of alarms, triggered in an autonomic networking environment. The proposed framework was assessed via an early prototype, deployed to IPv 6 end-sites, distributed across Europe and interconnected via the Internet...|$|E
30|$|When txRate is 1 and  2, the {{available}} resources are relatively abundant {{with regard to}} the resource needs of ACs and business functions at the given workloads. Thus, we get the same “response time of 90  % NewOrder” results in the “No AC Runs” and “ACs Run” tests. However, when txRate is above  3, the resources become scarce at the given workloads. In such cases, the ACs indeed compete with business functions for the limited resources, which will surely interfere with the processing of the latter. For instance, when txRate is  6, the tested result in “ACs Run” is 141  % of that in “No AC Runs” test. ACs can incur performance penalties, but being a full-fledged autonomic JEE server, PkuAS needs to run together with them. For instance, LP manages logs and RTM records response time for administration. As to TPA, what should be noted is that it manages the thread-pool of PkuAS, which can improve the system performance if the management effects exceed the runtime costs. That is why we see in Fig.  2 that when txRate is above 6, the performance of PkuAS running with ACs is much better than that of the “pure” PkuAS. The “ACs Run” curve also illustrates the main use of ACs: <b>self-handling</b> unexpected extreme cases such as a sudden surge of client requests or runtime exceptions.|$|E
40|$|Background: Medication {{safety is}} an {{important}} topic in healthcare nowadays. Pharmacovigilance, the monitoring of drug safety after approval for marketing, depends mainly on {{the quality and quantity}} of reported adverse drug reactions (ADR). To increase pharmacovigilance awareness among medical students, we developed and evaluated a Student-run Pharmacovigilance program, together with pharmacovigilance centre Lareb. Method: A pilot study was performed in which teams of (1 st- 4 th year) medical students assessed real ADR-reports from patients/healthcare professionals reported to Lareb. After assessment on causality, students searched for a pharmacological explanation and wrote a feedback letter to the reporter and a summary for the pharmacovigilance- databases of the European Medicines Agency and WHO. This student-assessment was then verified by Lareb staff, who evaluated student-handling it in an e-questionnaire. Results: From May to December 2014, 89 different ADR-reports selected by Lareb staff were handled, with the top 3 reported ADRs being; palpitations, urinary retention and agitation. Thirty-five students and 3 Lareb staff members participated. Lareb staff rated the student assessments (very) useful (> 92 %), scientifically substantiated (> 88 %), complete (not lacking information) and without inaccuracies (both > 92 %). Altogether the student-assessments were rated mean 8. 3 (1 - 10; min-max). Compared to <b>self-handling,</b> Lareb staff indicated student-assessment cost less time in 33 % assessments, neutral in 55 %, and cost extra time in 11 %. Conclusion: The Student-run pharmacovigilance program is a win-win venture. It offers students a valuable “pharmacovigilance experience”, creates awareness in future doctors with the potential to increase ADR-reporting, and didn't cost Lareb staff extra time overall. The learner effects need to be investigated in future studies...|$|E
