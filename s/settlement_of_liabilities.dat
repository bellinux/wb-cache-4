40|$|The {{aim of the}} Bachelor {{thesis is}} the {{analysis}} of the development of agricultural societies from 1948 to the present, with special focus on the transformation of agricultural cooperatives and the incomplete settlement obligations to co-operators. It is a socially current topic because the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>liabilities</b> of agricultural cooperatives with co-operators or members of cooperatives is not until now largely completed, those rightful persons are reduced to their rights. Through this work, I wanted to find an answer to the question, how is it possible that in the restitution process were rightful persons by law to be dealt with, but the members of the cooperatives are not. In the theoretical part of the work will be characterized the concepts and definitions relating to ownership, both in a centrally planned economy and market economy, the basic concepts and definitions related to the theme of collectivization and the transformation of cooperatives, etc. In the practical part will be first analyzed the legal framework governing agricultural societies in the centrally planned economy, but also from the period after 1989 until the present time. It will also examine the development of agricultural societies with special reference to the period of collectivization and transformation after 1989 to be the two most crucial periods are compared and evaluated...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the evolution of}} intergovernmental relationships on debt rescheduling. It starts describing some experiences that aroused in the 18 th Century and which negotiations were carried out, in many occasions, {{with the help of}} gunboat diplomacy. The <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>liabilities</b> that were created at the aftermath of the two 20 th Century World Wars, which were – at least for some countries –- not exactly debt but war reparations, gave some insights in how to deal with these problems allowing the debtor country to find its own path {{to get out of the}} debt overhang. The settlement of these foreign liabilities may give some guidelines for dealing with debt restructuring in more general cases The creation of the Paris Club – which is a very civilized way to settle debt defaults compared to gunboat diplomacy – is analyzed and described here: first its emergency as an ad hoc transitory institution and later its evolution toward its definitive establishment in the international financial system landscape. It is also suggested that for a combination of events, which included the launch in Evian of the G- 8 ’s so-called Evian Approach for the Paris Club, as well as the lack of support of some major industrialized countries to the implementation of a Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism (SDRM), the Paris Club has become the only feasible international intergovernmental debt restructuring mechanism in spite of numerous shortcomings embodied in it. On this basis, some improvements of the actual mechanism are proposed, without precluding the possibility of the implementation of a more equilibrated SDRM in the future. ...|$|E

40|$|Legally {{effective}} {{for the last}} thirty years, {{the provisions of the}} Decree of Oct. 26, 1956 are presently found to be obsolete to a considerable degree. They comply with the conditions of the forties and fifties. Legal and financial institutions of this regulation as well as its wording required adjustments to current socio-economic conditions and legal position. These postulates have been satisfied by virtue of the Act of Dec. 19, 1980, <b>of</b> <b>Liabilities</b> to Pay Taxes. A different regulation of several questions was introduced in the new law. The following provisions are to be numbered among the controversial matters: authority of administration for a taxpayer's house search and simultaneously not mentioning of explicit premises to be satisfied to create grounds for the search, retention of an institution of taxation at estimate. The substantial changes involve a different treatment of such problems as dates <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>liabilities</b> and <b>of</b> their extinction, overpayment of the tax and the interest on it, limitation rules <b>of</b> tax <b>liabilities,</b> <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> a taxpayer's spouse, his family members and third persons to pay his taxes, explicit definitions of the subject matter of taxation and of persons coming within the scope of this law, unification of dates of payment for the taxpayers.

40|$|Florida law is {{currently}} unclear {{on the issue}} of whether a professional may rely upon a limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clause in a professional services contract. Limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses are common in business contracts, especially in construction, a field that includes many professionals such as engineers and architects. While Florida has historically enforced limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses in professional services contracts, recent cases have cast doubt on whether the clauses are enforceable. If the Florida Supreme Court establishes that professionals cannot rely upon these clauses, it will be taking a position contrary to the majority of states, including New York, California, and Texas, all of which enforce limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses with varying degrees of restriction. This Note argues that Florida should not prohibit professionals from using limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses. These clauses do not violate public policy when, as already required by Florida law, the clauses are stated clearly, ensuring that both parties to the contract are aware of their existence. Permitting professionals to continue to rely upon limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses honors the contracting parties’ freedom of contract. Additionally, limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses provide an efficient method for parties to allocate risk...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how {{the absence of}} insurance in the past led to some special maritime liability law principles such as 'general average' (i. e., losses or expenses shared by all the parties to a maritime adventure) and the limitation <b>of</b> shipowners' <b>liability.</b> In the absence of insurance, these principles served the function of insurance mostly for shipowners. As commercial marine insurance is now widely available, these principles have lost their justification and may in fact interfere with the most important goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law i. e., deterrence from negligence. The thesis thus recommends their abolition. The thesis further argues that when insurance is easily available and affordable to the both parties to a liability claim, the main goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law should be deterrence as opposed to compensation. This is exactly {{the case with the}} maritime cargo liability claims where both cargo owners and shipowners are invariably insured. As a result, the sole focus <b>of</b> cargo <b>liability</b> law should be and, to a great extent, is deterrence. On the other hand, in the vessel-source oil pollution liability setting, pollution victims are not usually insured. Therefore, oil pollution liability law has to cater both for compensation and deterrence, the two traditional goals <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law. The final question the thesis addresses is whether the deterrent effect <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law is affected by the availability <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance. Contrary the popular belief the thesis attempts to prove that the presence <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance is not necessarily a hindrance but can be a complementary force towards the realization of deterrent goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law...|$|R
