50|$|Born in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, Hollis deputised as <b>Small</b> <b>Heath's</b> goalkeeper for England {{international}} Chris Charsley, {{an amateur}} whose {{career in the}} Birmingham City Police entailed his frequent absence from footballing duties. He made 49 appearances in all senior competitions, including 17 in <b>Small</b> <b>Heath's</b> last season in the Football Alliance and 31 in their first two seasons in the Football League. In 1894, Hollis's amateur status was reinstated and he joined Bournbrook F.C., retiring from the game in 1897.|$|R
50|$|Watson joined Birmingham City Police in 1895, {{rising to}} the rank of sergeant, played for their {{football}} team, and often used to police <b>Small</b> <b>Heath's</b> matches. He died in Birmingham in 1902.|$|R

5|$|In <b>Small</b> <b>Heath's</b> {{last game}} in October, {{at home to}} Darwen, a 3–2 victory was marred by a serious injury to full-back Fred Speller. Soon after kickoff. Speller was {{in the act of}} kicking the ball when the onrushing William Campbell {{collided}} with him, knocking him to the ground. A police constable administered first aid before the player, whose leg was broken, was carried from the field on a plank and taken to hospital. On a heavy pitch in poor condition, it was nearly impossible to dribble the ball, and <b>Small</b> <b>Heath's</b> decision to play on with only one back meant Darwen's attackers were frequently caught offside.|$|R
50|$|The {{sand dunes}} and {{shoreline}} plants support large numbers {{and a wide}} variety of insect species. Butterflies and moths present include common blues (Polyommatus icarus), <b>small</b> <b>heaths</b> (Coenonympha pamphilus), <b>small</b> coppers (Lycaena phlaeas), the sub-species caeruleopunctata, graylings (Hipparchia semele) and the six-spot burnet (Zygaena filipendulae).|$|R

50|$|Alfred Jones (fl. 1885-1915) was <b>Small</b> <b>Heath's</b> first secretary-manager. Appointed in 1892, {{the year}} of their {{admission}} to the Football League, he oversaw the club winning the inaugural Football League Second Division championship, promotion to the First Division the following year, and two further promotions before his retirement in 1908.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s and 1980s the {{heathland}} {{fell into}} a poor state of repair because the surrounding brush was ill-maintained and coppicing, which {{is essential for the}} maintenance of <b>small</b> <b>heaths,</b> had ceased. Gradually, the area became more and more overgrown with newly grown brush composed of the saplings of deciduous trees, and became to resemble more of a young wood.|$|R
5|$|<b>Small</b> <b>Heath's</b> {{final game}} of January was a 3–1 defeat of Burton Swifts in the Birmingham Cup. They went into February with a three-point lead over Darwen, each club having only four League games left to play.

He played nine times in all competitions for Lincoln's first team, later joining Reading and then returning to Wales. In {{the latter part of}} his career he was employed more often as an emergency goalkeeper than a full-back.|$|R

50|$|The Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve covers {{tropical}} humid {{forests in}} mountain and highland systems and coastal marine environments.It includes {{remnants of the}} Atlantic Forest and relevant secondary forests.The moist, sub-tropical, semi-deciduous forest includes species such as Araucaria angustifolia, Podocarpus lambertii and Drimys brasiliensis.Associated ecosystems include upland meadows with grasses and <b>small</b> <b>heaths,</b> cerrado, mangroves, salt marsh scrublands and sand spits.These lie in the most densely populated parts of Brazil, resulting in threats to their environmental integrity.|$|R
5|$|<b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> Athletic Club (later called <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> Harriers) {{established}} {{its headquarters}} at the Muntz Street ground from the club's foundation in 1891. Though primarily a cross-country and road-racing club, they {{also participated in}} track and field athletics, and during the summer months the athletes were allowed to train on the football pitch.|$|E
5|$|<b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> {{entered the}} 1892–93 FA Cup {{at the first}} round proper, and lost in that round to First Division club Burnley. In local competitions, they were {{eliminated}} by Aston Villa in the semi-final of the Birmingham Senior Cup and {{the final of the}} Mayor of Birmingham's Charity Cup. <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> also played several friendly matches during the season, including benefit matches for players Harry Morris, Caesar Jenkyns and Fred Speller.|$|E
5|$|The 1892–93 {{season was}} the twelfth season of {{competitive}} association football played by <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> F.C., an English football club based in Birmingham. After finishing in third {{position in the}} Football Alliance in 1891–92, <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> was one of 12 clubs elected to the newly formed Second Division for the 1892–93 Football League season.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Small</b> <b>Heaths</b> {{reserves}} {{reached the}} semi-final of the Walsall Cup, but were beaten 4-1 in a replay by an Aston Villa reserve team [...] "showing superior form in all departments of the game". In a post-season friendly, Jack Astons goal earned a draw with West Bromwich Albion, {{and in the}} last match of the season at Coventry Road, the reserves played a Birmingham Police team to benefit the Association for Providing Boots and Clothing for Destitute Children.|$|R
50|$|He {{made his}} debut {{for the club}} in February 1901, and his 13 goals in the {{remaining}} 13 games of the 1900-01 season, which included the winning goal in four of those games, made a major contribution to <b>Small</b> <b>Heath's</b> securing runners-up spot in the Second Division and promotion to the First Division. Injury forced him to miss {{a part of the}} 1901-02 season, in which the club were relegated, and his contribution to their runners-up position in 1902-03 was severely curtailed by injury.|$|R
5000|$|Described as [...] "stocky {{and very}} quick off the mark", Leatherbarrow had scored freely {{at each of}} his {{previous}} clubs; he had a run of four games {{in the absence of}} Billy Walton, and scored a hat-trick in the second of those, but was unable to force his way into <b>Small</b> <b>Heath's</b> first-choice eleven. In April 1895 he moved to Southern League champions Millwall Athletic, and his 17 league goals made a major contribution to the club retaining their title in the 1895-96 season. In December 1896 he joined fellow Southern League club Chatham.|$|R
5|$|Back in the League, Hollis took Charsley's {{place in}} goal, as {{customary}} in the latter's absence. The heavy ground did not suit the visitors, Grimsby Town, and the <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> forwards' hard-working combination play brought them victory by eight goals to three. The following week, the Coventry Road ground hosted benefit matches for striking ironplate-workers. Around 1,500 spectators watched a match between tinplate- and ironplate-workers' elevens, {{followed by a}} second between teams raised by former Aston Villa captain Archie Hunter, whose poor health prevented him playing, and the recently retired <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> forward Eddy Stanley, who led his team to a 9–3 victory. <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> went into March with a four-point lead over Darwen, each club having only two League games left to play, but the former's goal average was so much superior that Sheffield United, in third place, ten points behind with five games in hand, were the only team still able to overhaul them.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham City Football Club, an English {{association}} {{football club}} {{based in the}} city of Birmingham, was founded in 1875 under the name of <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> Alliance.

5000|$|In {{his younger}} days he played at inside forward. He was skilful {{on the ball}} with good {{movement}} and shooting ability. In <b>Small</b> <b>Heath's</b> first season in the Second Division, 1892-93, the front three of Walton, Frank Mobley and Fred Wheldon scored over 50 goals between them in a 22-game season; the following season the same trio scored 62 goals in the 28 games, Walton contributing 16 in 20. Later in his career he moved back to wing half, where his tireless encouragement of the younger players earned him the nickname [...] "Mother".|$|R

500|$|The players went to Malvern {{for special}} {{training}} before the home game with Burnley. Joe Fountain was an [...] "excellent" [...] stand-in for the injured Tommy Hands at outside left and Jenkyns was [...] "a tower of strength" [...] as Wheldon scored the only {{goal of a}} scrappy game to bring <b>Small</b> <b>Heath's</b> points total to 22 with three matches left. The Daily Post predicted that 24 {{would be enough to}} avoid the test matches. On Easter Monday, Hands returned to the team for the last home League match of the season, a goalless draw with Sheffield Wednesday in which both teams had numerous chances to score.|$|R
