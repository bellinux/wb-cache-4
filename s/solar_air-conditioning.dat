The demand can be expected to increase because of changing working times, increased comfort expectations and global warming. Air-conditioning systems in use are most often built around a vapor compression systems driven by grid-electricity. However, most ways of generating the electricity today, as weil as the refrigerants being used in traditional vapor compression systems, have negative impact on the environment, <b>Solar</b> <b>air-conditioning</b> might be a way to reduce the demand for electricity.

The experiment is conducted at Solar District Cooling Sdn. Bhd and data collected from building automation system for 30 days from 1 st- 30 th June 2010. The data analysed using the theoretical analysis and plotted in graph to discuss about it. The solar collector efficiency varies from 50 to 80 % during day time and stored energy can be used during night time.

40|$|Due to {{economical}} {{and environmental}} concerns, the energy e fficiency of buildings nowadays {{has proven to}} play an increasingly important role. To satisfy the occupants comfort, the cooling of buildings generally involves a considerable consumption of electricity. Solar radiation, which is a free and renewable resource, {{is linked to the}} cooling needs of buildings. This work consists in the evaluation, from an energy-saving and economical point of view, of a potential use of solar energy for air-conditioning in residential and o ffice buildings. It includes an integral approach of <b>solar</b> <b>air-conditioning,</b> involving the analysis of the buildings cooling needs, the cold production devices, the solar collector fields and climates. This analysis is supported by simulations and experimental setups. The study of <b>solar</b> <b>air-conditioning</b> systems already available on the market or in laboratories reveals their operational principles as well as their main performance indicators. Two main solar cooling paths are investigated: a thermal and a photovoltaic conversion of solar energy. Besides this, the performance of the entire air-conditioning system broadens the question of the energy performance to the interactions between the diff erent parts of the system. The building thermal loads (heating, cooling, domestic hot water) of some theoretical residential and o ffice buildings are computed in a part of this work dealing with the influence of the comfort model, the building energy performance level and the climate. What comes across through this analysis is that, the location of the buildings put aside, the cooling load is greatly influenced by the envelope thermal performance and the internal gains. The cooling systems involving absorption or adsorption or vapour compression chiller cooling machines are simulated for the previously defi ned building cases. The use of solar energy through thermal collectors for heating meets higher primary energy savings than for cooling. In all cases, the thermally driven system achieves a lower energy and economical performance than a vapour compression chiller partially supplied with a photovoltaic field.

Summer air-conditioning represents a growing maret in building services world-wide in both commercial and residential buildings.

Different heat driven cooling technologies are available in the market, which can be used in combination with solar thermal collectors. The main obstacles for large scale applications, beside the high first cost, are the lack of practical knowledge on design, control and operation of these systems. For small scale systems, many years no appropriate technology was available on the market. However, recently several mainly European companies started development of water chillers in the power range below 50 kW down to 5 kW, and first commercial systems are now available.

Within the theoretical framework of the thesis it was argued that climate change and increasing energy prices due to depletion of fossil fuels would cause pressure on hotel operations in Cyprus by increasing their cooling loads and operational costs. The analysis was techno-socio-economic and the core aim was to evaluate the costeffectiveness of selected energy saving strategies. These were {{in the form of}} building envelope upgrades, changes in indoor environmental criteria and introduction of renewable energy technology via <b>solar</b> <b>air-conditioning</b> to be implemented as part of the hotels’ periodic scheduled building and systems upgrades with the aim of lowering their space conditioning energy costs and improving their profitability and competitiveness. The applied methodology consisted of auditing of a case study hotel, energy consumption data collection both from a sample of hotels and industry-wide and a hotel guest survey. Thermal simulation of hotels in present and future climates was used to identify technically viable renovation strategies. Strategies found cost-effective were further checked for sensitivity to energy prices, hotel occupancy and climate. The major findings of the thesis predict over 20 % savings in space conditioning energy costs due to strategic building envelope upgrades, over 50 % savings if in addition adjustments in thermal comfort criteria are included and over 80 % savings if solar AC is added into the above. It was further found that with a minimal increase in room rates hotels could implement thermal renovation while maintaining or even increasing room income. A unique cost-efficiency indicator that measures profitability of the proposed energy saving strategies in terms of hotels’ room income generation potential was developed in this thesis.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this review is to provide fundamental understandings of the solar adsorption systems and to give useful guidelines regarding designs parameters of adsorbent bed reactors,and the applicability ofsolar adsorption both in air-conditioning and refrigeration with {{the improvement of the}} coefficient of performance. Solar adsorption heat pump and refrigeration devices are of significance to meet the needs for cooling requirements such as air-conditioning and ice-making and medical or food preservation in remote areas. They are also noiseless, non-corrosive and environmentally friendly. For these reasons the research activities in this sector are still increasing to solve the crucial points that make these systems not yet ready to compete with the well-known vapor compression system. There is an increasing interest in the development and use of adsorption chillers due to their various economic and impressive environmental benefits, enabling solar energy or waste heat to be used for applications such as district networks and cogeneration plants. Compared to adsorption systems that require heat sources with temperatures above 100 Â°C (zeolite-water systems, activated carbon-methanol systems) or conventional compressor chillers, a silica gel/water adsorption refrigerator uses waste heat with temperature below 100 Â°C. This creates new possibilities for utilizing low temperature energy. <b>Solar</b> adsorption <b>Air-conditioning</b> Adsorption chillers Refrigeration Ice-making...|$|R

Main components {{that make up the}} system are a small-capacity adsorption machine of 8 kW, a solar field of flat plate single glazed collectors with a small buffer tank, a cold distribution system through a radiant ceiling and liquid-to-ambient heat exchanger as auxiliary temperature source. The engineering of the plant has been carried out by using detailed transient modelling tools developed by RDmes. Sensors and hardware for detailed measuring and control of the plant have been installed in order to analyze the actual performance. First measurements of the plant will be obtained during summer 2010. This work addresses details on the engineering and planning process. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
