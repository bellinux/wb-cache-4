The condemned man could be fastened to the cross lying on the ground at the place of execution, then lifted up on it.

The victim was tied to the crosspiece and was hoisted up with the horizontal beam and made fast to the vertical stake. They <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> this was the simpler form of erection, and the carrying of the crossbeam (patibulum) was probably a form of punishment for slaves, the crux commissa may be taken as the normal practice.|$|E

No, holding that vengeance upon their enemies was more to be desired than any personal blessings, and reckoning this to be the most glorious of hazards, they joyfully determined to accept the risk... Thus, choosing to die resisting, rather than to live submitting, they fled only from dishonour..."

2500|$|The Gemara recounted a {{discussion}} regarding {{the right of}} the firstborn in [...] Once Rabbi Jannai was walking, leaning on the shoulder of Rabbi Simlai his attendant, and Rabbi Judah the Prince came to meet them. Rabbi Judah the Prince asked Rabbi Jannai what the Scriptural basis was for the proposition that a son takes precedence over a daughter in the inheritance of a mother's estate. Rabbi Jannai replied that the plural use of the term [...] "tribes" [...] in the discussion of the inheritance of the daughters of Zelophehad in [...] indicates that the mother's tribe is to be compared to the father's tribe, and {{as in the case of}} the father's tribe, a son takes precedence over a daughter, so in the case of the mother's tribe, a son should take precedence over a daughter. Rabbi Judah the Prince challenged Rabbi Jannai, saying that if it this were so, one could <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> in the case of the father's tribe, a firstborn takes a double portion, so in the case of the mother's tribe would a firstborn take a double portion. Rabbi Jannai dismissed the remark of Rabbi Judah the Prince. The Gemara then inquired why it is true that a firstborn son takes a double share in his father's estate but not his mother's. Abaye replied that [...] says, [...] "of all that he [...] has," [...] implying all that [...] "he" [...] (the father) has and not all that [...] "she" [...] (the mother) has. The Gemara asked whether the proposition that a firstborn son takes a double portion only in the estate of his father might apply only in the case where a bachelor married a widow (who had children from her first marriage, and thus the father's firstborn son was not that of the mother). And thus where a bachelor married a virgin (so that the firstborn son of the father would also be the firstborn son of the mother) might the firstborn son also take a double portion in his mother’s estate? Rav Nahman bar Isaac replied that [...] says, [...] "for he [...] is the first-fruits of his [...] strength," [...] from which we can infer that the law applies to the first fruits of the father’s strength and not the first-fruits of the mother’s strength. The Gemara replied that [...] teaches that though a son was born after a miscarriage (and thus did not [...] "open the womb" [...] and is not regarded as a firstborn son for purposes of [...] "sanctification to the Lord" [...] and [...] "redemption from the priest" [...] in [...] ) he is nonetheless regarded as the firstborn son for purposes of inheritance. [...] thus implies that only the son for whom the father's heart grieves is included in the law, but a miscarriage, for which the father's heart does not grieve, is excluded. (And thus, since [...] is necessary for this deduction, it could not have been meant for the proposition that the law applies to the first fruits of the father’s strength and not of the mother’s strength.) But then the Gemara reasoned that if [...] is necessary for excluding miscarriages, then [...] should have read, [...] "for he is the first-fruits of strength," [...] but [...] in fact says, [...] "his strength." [...] Thus one may deduce two laws from [...] But the Gemara objected further that still that the words of [...] "the first-fruits of his [...] strength," [...] not her strength, might apply only to the case of a widower (who had children from his first wife) who married a virgin (since the first son from the second marriage would be only the wife's firstborn, not the husband’s). But where a bachelor married a virgin (and thus the son would be the firstborn of both the father and the mother), the firstborn son might take a double portion also in his mother’s estate. But Raba concluded that [...] states, [...] "{{the right of the}} firstborn is his ," [...] and this indicates that the right of the firstborn applies to a man’s estate and not to a woman’s.–b2.
