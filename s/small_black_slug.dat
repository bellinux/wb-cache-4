50|$|There is {{much debate}} {{concerning}} <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> effect upon plant species diversity. Slug impacts change over successional stages, and Alaska conservationists observed the <b>black</b> <b>slug’s</b> impact on species diversity depends upon community composition. If {{a system is}} composed of sensitive species, the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> will likely {{have a negative impact}} by pressuring said species. If a system presents more evenness with less sensitive species, the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> may promote species diversity and encourage healthy succession rates.|$|R
50|$|Around the 1970s, the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> came to Alaska via nursery plants, potting soil, {{or among}} {{shipments}} containing wood pallets. The Alaska National Heritage Project published an invasive ranking for the <b>black</b> <b>slug,</b> providing a recent {{case study of}} the species as an invasive. They ranked the species based upon distribution, biological characteristics, ecological impacts, and feasibility of control. These categories were assigned points, and Arion ater received a 62/100, awarding it a qualitative score of “moderately invasive.” This report stated the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> can often be found in disturbed soils or areas with well-irrigated soils such as lawns. Frequent sightings along roads suggest the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> might move more easily along human traffic corridors; however, the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> is believed to migrate little during its one-year life span. Arion ater’s biology awarded it its highest risk factor. Again, the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> is a prolific, omnivorous consumer, capable of inhabiting {{a wide range of}} conditions with high fecundity. Its effect upon local ecology received a moderate score; while the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> puts pressure on native systems, it does not appear to catalyze entire regime shifts within the habitats where it has invaded. Greatest concern appears to be its possible pressure on early successional plants and native <b>slugs.</b> The <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> often feeds upon seedlings, diminishing plants’ reproductive success, but the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> {{does not appear to be}} feeding selectively, endangering one plant species over another. And the <b>black</b> <b>slug’s</b> effect on native-Alaska slugs is unknown, but the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> might be displacing the banana slug in BC, Canada; however, such displacement might not have implications beyond those for the banana slugs. Slugs facilitate seed and spore dispersal through fecal matter. The <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> facilitates nutrient cycling by decomposing decaying and fecal matter; additionally, slug mucus left behind in the soil helps cycle nutrients, and Arion ater may merely step into this niche in place of native slugs. Arion ater has spread in Alaska in the following places: Anchorage, Cordova, Yakutat, Gustavus, Juneau, Sitka, Tenakee Springs, Ketchikan, and Kodiak Island, and in some of these areas, the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> threatens lilies and orchids. It is unlikely complete removal can be achieved given high fecundity, but fencing and educating the public to hand pick <b>black</b> <b>slugs</b> might mitigate associated invasion risks.|$|R
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> {{is mainly}} nocturnal and avoids {{exposure}} to sunlight. It is omnivorous, eating carrion, fungi, animal feces, algae, lichen, and vegetation (living or decaying). These slugs prefer to eat on cloudy days or {{at night when}} temperatures are above 10 degrees Celsius. Mucus-production necessitates moist habitats, such as among leaf-litter, mosses, or fallen trees. Consequently, the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> becomes most active after rainfall. A 1976 study compared <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> assimilation rates to that of similar slugs in the UK. The study determined the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> feeds at similar rates to other European slugs (in terms of biomass), suggesting the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> is an equally important decomposer/consumer in forest systems. The study theorized these high assimilation rates might result from abundant enzymes in slug digestive systems: amylase, invertase, cellulase, xylanase, and chitinase. The last might be especially indicative of how these slugs can consume large quantities of fungi such as Armillaria mellea. Microbiota within <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> digestive systems produce these enzymes—such as the bacteria that produce cellulose—enabling the slugs to break down lignocellulose. A recent study further explored Arion ater’s gut microbiome and discovered the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> to have far more bacteria within its gut than did neighboring, northern European insects, including members of the orders Coleoptera, Isoptera, Orthoptera, and Diptera. This study learned the <b>black</b> <b>slug’s</b> gut microbiome to be functional at {{a wide range of}} temperatures and pH levels, and its results suggest that the mycobacterial culture may be uniform throughout the <b>black</b> <b>slug’s</b> gut and that Gammaproteobacteria composes most of this culture. This study contrasted its results to studies of North American <b>black</b> <b>slugs</b> that presented higher levels of cellulolytic activity at a narrower pH range. In summary, Arion ater can digest diverse food material such as cellulose because gut bacteria produce digestive enzymes.|$|R
50|$|Researching the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> has {{provided}} human and ecological value. For example, a 1996 {{study investigated the}} bioaccumulation of mercury in <b>black</b> <b>slugs</b> and determined these slugs {{could be used to}} monitor levels of heavy metals in terrestrial systems—similar to how ecologists use aquatic mollusks. And a 2014 study researched the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> gut’s microbiology in hopes of catalyzing other studies of cellulolytic activity that could improve biofuel technology.|$|R
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> (also {{known as}} black arion, European <b>black</b> <b>slug,</b> or large <b>black</b> <b>slug)</b> Arion ater L. {{is a large}} {{terrestrial}} gastropod mollusk in the family Arionidae—the round back slugs. Land slugs lack shells like other terrestrial mollusks (such as snails). Without such shells, slugs produce unappetizing mucus—that may also contain toxins—to deter predators. Additionally, terrestrial slugs produce two other forms of mucus that facilitate locomotion and prevent death from drying. Such mollusks are hermaphroditic preferring to find mates. Slugs most often function as decomposers but are also often omnivores. Arion ater is one such slug, decomposing organic matter, preying on other organisms, and consuming vegetative matter—including agricultural crops. Native to Europe, the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> is an invasive species in Australia, Canada (British Columbia, Newfoundland, Quebec), and the United States—Pacific Northwest.|$|R

50|$|In recent years, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that the Spanish slug has bred with the indigenous <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> Arion ater to produce a more frost-resistant variety in the more northerly regions. Danish authorities maintain that the Spanish <b>slug,</b> <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> and red slug are in fact subspecies of the same species.|$|R
50|$|Like {{other members}} of the family Arionidae, the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> has a pneumostome (breathing hole) {{on the right side of}} its mantle through which it breathes. This mantle is the part in snails that secretes a shell, but in the <b>black</b> <b>slug,</b> the mantle {{contains}} a resilient protective structure of calcareous granules.|$|R
50|$|These slugs might endanger {{sensitive}} ecosystems, {{especially as}} an invasive species, {{and it is}} yet unclear how drastically these slugs might alter plant community compositions. The <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> is a voracious seedling predator. Terrestrial slugs {{are considered to be}} especially dangerous because they alter plant species abundance, adult plant fecundity, and the production of plant defensive compounds. <b>Black</b> <b>slugs</b> are of special concern in fragmented ecosystems and areas with high shrub and tree cover. In Alaska, the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> threatens seedling populations of lilies and orchids after already having diminished sensitive populations of deltoid balsamroot and yellow montane violet in BC Canada.|$|R

50|$|Like other {{terrestrial}} <b>slugs,</b> the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> is a hermaphrodite, {{preferring to}} find a mate—often several—but can self-fertilize. After mating, the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> seeks a dark, moist environment such as beneath mosses—occasionally within topsoil—to lay its eggs about 5mm (0.2 in) in diameter. Between August and October, an individual slug lays up to one-hundred fifty eggs every one to three weeks—clutches diminishing to twenty eggs late in the season. Juveniles hatch after at least twenty-seven days, hatching later under cold temperatures. Maturation takes up to nine months, enabling mating in early summer. <b>Black</b> <b>slugs</b> die shortly after laying its last clutch, rarely surviving into a second year.|$|R
50|$|Conservationists {{within the}} Pacific Northwest and BC Canada are {{concerned}} about competition between Arion ater and native slugs such as the banana slug (Ariolimax californicus, A. columbianus, and A. dolichophallus). The University of British Columbia’s zoology department published a study on this interaction in 2015. They determined the two slugs to be functionally different but proposed further studies to determine if <b>black</b> <b>slugs</b> are displacing native slugs. Their study found <b>black</b> <b>slugs</b> were more abundant and consumed a greater quantity of mushrooms than native banana slugs but could not determine reasons for differences in population sizes. They theorized the greater abundance of <b>black</b> <b>slugs</b> could be because the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> displaced banana slugs or because the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> might be invading areas with previously low banana slug numbers; however, there is no data for banana slug population sizes prior {{to the arrival of}} Arion ater. This complicates determining if alien slugs have a negative or negligible effect upon native slug numbers. Additionally, this study could not determine if high fungi-consumption resulted from dietary preference or from higher concentrations of alien slugs amidst Douglas fir forests, which promote fungal growth. The study also concluded that <b>black</b> and banana <b>slugs</b> compete for under-story berries. Thankfully, the study demonstrated neither native nor alien slugs consume conifer or fern seedlings. The study demonstrated no significant difference between metabolic rates; however, they concluded the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> may eat more because of its shorter life span (one compared to several years), requiring faster consumption rates in order to reach sexual maturity. The study demonstrated both slugs benefit ecosystems by dispersing seeds and spores. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the two slugs to be functionally different; however, this study proposed further research on the following to determine if <b>black</b> <b>slugs</b> are displacing banana slugs: interactions between Arion ater and fungal communities and comparative studies looking at seed dispersal rates to determine their effect on native, fruit-bearing plant communities.|$|R
50|$|Most animals {{prefer not}} to prey upon the <b>black</b> <b>slugs</b> because of the taste of its mucus and because this mucus can make them {{slippery}} and consequently difficult to capture; however, this slug does have some natural predators, including the hedgehog, badger, shrew, mole, mouse, frog, toad, snake, carnivorous beetle, and some birds. When picked up or touched, the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> will contract to a hemispherical shape and begin to rock from side to side. This defensive behavior confuses predators, and is unique in the Arionidae family.|$|R
50|$|The area is {{also home}} to the banana slug (Ariolimax columbianus), which has {{recently}} been threatened by the encroachment of a new species of <b>slug,</b> the <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> (Arion ater), an invasive species from Northern Europe.|$|R

50|$|From there, {{they took}} to the Mont Bellevue Park, where the soil {{humidity}} is conducive to their locomotion, and where their massive size and lack of shell means they easily outcompete native species. The <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> also has few natural predators in North America, meaning it {{is a threat to}} the stability of the ecosystems on the mountain.|$|R
50|$|Often such {{complexes}} {{only become}} evident {{when a new}} species is introduced into the system, breaking down existing species barriers.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{invasive}} alien species are greatest when they become dominant members of a community, introduce novel traits, and displace native species. Invasions by alien mollusks represent a novel context by which to compare trait differences between generalist native and introduced herbivores in terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we determined the abundance, habitat, feeding preferences, {{as well as the}} metabolic rate of the native Pacific banana slug (Ariolimax columbianus) and the alien <b>black</b> <b>slug</b> (Arion rufus) in the coastal forests of British Columbia, Canada. Through a series of observational and experimental studies, we found that alien slugs are more abundant, differ in their habitat preferences, and consumed more fungi (mushrooms) than native banana slugs. Conversely, in an enclosures experiment we found that herbivory damage by native slugs was higher compared to enclosures with alien only and control enclosures. Finally, metabolic rates were similar for both slug species. These results suggest that alien <b>black</b> <b>slugs</b> possess a suite of traits that make them functionally different from native banana slugs...|$|R
