40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a longitudinal study}} of the early literacy development of 47 children with <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties</b> from ages 4 to 7 years. Of these children, 19 with specific <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties</b> were compared with 19 children with <b>speech</b> and language <b>difficulties</b> and 19 normally developing controls. The risk of literacy difficulties was greater in the group with <b>speech</b> and language <b>difficulties,</b> and these children displayed deficits in phoneme awareness at 6 years. In contrast, the literacy development of children with isolated speech problems was {{not significantly different from}} that of controls. A path analysis relating early speech, language, and literacy skills indicated that preschool language ability was a unique predictor of phoneme awareness at 5; 8 (years; months), which, together with early reading skill, predicted literacy outcome at 6; 9. Once the effects of phoneme awareness were controlled, neither speech perception nor speech production processes predicted variation in literacy skills. However, it is noteworthy that children with persisting <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties</b> at 6; 9 were particularly vulnerable to deficits in reading-related processes...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on a study by Joffe and Pring (2008) which {{investigated}} assessment and therapy methods used by Speech Language Therapists (SLTs) in the United Kingdom for children with phonological difficulties. Joffe and Pring reported SLTs’ most favoured assessments and therapy approaches in that context. Children with <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties</b> are likely to form a considerable part of SLT caseloads in South Africa, but the choice of assessments may not be so clearcut given the linguistic diversity of the region and the fact that few assessments have been developed specifically for the SA population. Linked to difficulties with assessment, selection of intervention approaches may also pose challenges. This study aimed to investigate the methods of assessment and intervention used by SLTs in the Western Cape when working with children with <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties.</b> A questionnaire was sent to SLTs working with pre and/ or primary school- aged children. Twenty-nine clinicians of varying experience responded. The majority of SLTs (89 %) use informal assessment tools in combination with formal assessment. When using formal assessments, more than 50 % of SLTs make modifications to better suit the population. Participants use a variety of intervention approaches, often in combination, and based on a child’s individual profile of difficulties and available resources. Forty-six percent of SLTs felt unsure about the selection of assessments and intervention for bi/multilingual children with <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties.</b> SLTs suggested that guidelines about accepted / typical speech development in the region would be helpful for their clinical practice. Clinical implications of the findings are discussed together with some suggestions for developing knowledge of children’s <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties</b> in the South African context...|$|R

40|$|Children with {{developmental}} speech disorder of no known aetiology constitute a heterogeneous group, {{both in their}} presenting difficulties, which can include additional language and <b>speech</b> perception <b>difficulties,</b> and in the developmental course of the disorder. This thesis examines this heterogeneity from a developmental and psycholinguistic perspective. Using a longitudinal design, speech processing and language skills are explored over {{three years in a}} group of children with <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties</b> (n= 47) and an age- and nonverbal IQ-matched longitudinal control group (n= 47), mean age 4; 06 - 6; 07. Other measures were of developmental history, family history, psychosocial status and therapy input. Key areas of investigation were: the proportion of children whose speech later resolves; uncovering the 'resolving' and 'persisting' profile; the role of input processing in speech development, in particular, the role of accent variability; and the occurrence of dissociable speech processing patterns on matched word/nonword repetition and on speech input tasks. Group characteristics were examined through an analysis of patterns of dissociation on tasks across the group and an examination of patterns of association on speech and language measures (in comparison to the control group) in order to establish the developmental relationships between different aspects of speech processing. Thus concurrent and longitudinal relationships were examined using descriptive statistics, prospective and retrospective subgroup analyses and multiple regression analyses. A 'persisting' speech profile was identified as a pervasive speech processing and language difficulty and/or more severe speech output problems. A 'resolved' profile was confined to early, moderate, specific <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties.</b> Apart from nonword repetition, {{there was no evidence that}} speech outcome was related to different rates of speech or language development. Using evidence from normal and atypical development, an interactive view of speech development is outlined. Despite the need to understand development as interactive, speech output performance is argued to be the main factor mediating and constraining change between the ages of 4 - 6 in children with <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties.</b> An emerging discrepancy between word and nonword repetition, with nonword repetition not improving at similar rates to word repetition in some children with persisting <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties,</b> is cited as additional evidence that speech output, in particular, motor programming deficit, is the core characteristic of a persisting speech disorder...|$|R
