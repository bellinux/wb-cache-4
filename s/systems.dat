Umezu (1980) classified sign <b>system</b> from the angle of genesis and construction principle of signs. The sign <b>system</b> activity plays the central role in the self regulation activity of behaviors. Sign <b>system</b> consists of aboriginal sign <b>system</b> and constructive sign <b>system.</b> Constructive sign <b>system</b> consists of symbolic sign <b>system</b> and non-symbolic sign <b>system.</b> Symbolic sign <b>system</b> is constituted on similarity to the event. Non-symbolic sign <b>system</b> consists of gestalt-qualitative sign <b>system</b> and molecule-synthetic sign <b>system.</b> Non-symbolic sign <b>system</b> is constituted on the next principle. Though there are difference between the sign <b>system</b> and the event <b>system,</b> while children consider the sign <b>system</b> and the event <b>system</b> as the same thing, they operate the sign <b>system.</b> Symbolic sign <b>system</b> is more readily learned as a sign in a child due to its similarity to the event <b>system.</b> Non-symbolic. sign <b>system</b> is difficult to learn due to its constructive principle. It is usually most difficult to establish the molecular-synthetic sign <b>system</b> as signs, as there are many steps of learning to operate the molecular-synthetic sign <b>system</b> freely...|$|R

Therefore, highly integrated information manufacturing <b>system</b> is installed in the organizations. Highly integrated information manufacturing <b>system</b> store data in one single data storage <b>system.</b> Refreshment and query function are to execute in the data storage <b>system</b> of information manufacturing <b>system</b> for making data available and for information support respectively. The tasks of the refreshment function (data loading, indexing) execute sequentially in the single data storage <b>system</b> oriented information manufacturing <b>system.</b> Further, a highly integrated information manufacturing <b>system</b> is developed for executing the tasks of refreshment and query function simultaneously in data storage <b>system.</b> This highly integrated information manufacturing <b>system</b> is the 3 - data storage <b>system</b> oriented information manufacturing <b>system.</b> These highly integrated information manufacturing <b>system</b> could also cause the data quality problems regarding the completeness, accuracy and timeliness data quality dimensions.
