5|$|The double {{burden that}} single mothers endure has a {{historical}} precedent, and still exists currently. Single mothers usually have {{higher rates of}} employment and children at home, and have the highest levels overall of the double burden. Women also typically have less economic resources than men, and have no partner to share the workload with them. Single mothers fall heavily under economic vulnerability. They may face job discrimination and not earn as much, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be further difficulties in maintaining the double burden. Single-mother families tend to hover near the poverty line, with a poverty rate that is twice as high of that for men.|$|E

Because of renewed foreign submarine activity at the Swedish coast in 2014 it was decided in 2015 that four TTT/SAR would be modified to SAR/ASW {{in order to increase}} the anti-submarine warfare capability, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be 9 TTT/SAR and 9 SAR/ASW.

25|$|The playoffs, {{known as}} the Red Bulls Salute, {{will take place in}} the Albert Schultz Eishalle, Vienna and in the Slovnaft Arena, Bratislava between 13–16 December 2012, with the Final game taking place in Slovnaft Arena. It will be played as a single-elimination tournament, meaning that the losing teams in each round are {{eliminated}} from the tournament. For the first time in Red Bulls Salute history, no classification/placement games will be played, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> only be Quarterfinals, Semifinals as well as the Final game. The winner of the Red Bulls Salute will be awarded a total prize sum of €50 000, and the losing finalist receives €10 000.|$|E
25|$|In {{part because}} of such long {{retention}} times, as well as growing Internet upload speeds, Usenet is also used by individual users to store backup data in a practice called Usenet backup, or uBackup. While commercial providers offer more easy to use online backup services, storing data on Usenet is free of charge (although access to Usenet itself may not be). The method requires the user to manually select, prepare and upload the data. Because anyone can potentially download the backup files, the data is typically encrypted. After the files are uploaded, the uploader {{does not have any}} control over them; the files are automatically copied to all Usenet providers, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be multiple copies of it spread over different geographical locations around the world—desirable in a backup scheme.|$|E

25|$|If global {{oil prices}} remain high, {{it is likely}} that Canada will become one of the largest oil {{producers}} in the world in the next few decades. If <b>so,</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be environmental issues, resulting more from the vast scale of the operations rather than the toxicity of the products. The oil sands deposits are roughly the size of Florida and the operations would drastically alter the landscape, which until recently was largely wilderness. In addition, concerns have been raised about water supplies, since the mines and steam projects would use {{a large portion of the}} flow of several major rivers. The most serious problem in the short term is an acute labor and housing shortage which has driven vacancy rates in the oil sands area to zero and wages to extremely high levels. However, given the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue expected to be generated by the oil sands in the next few decades, {{it is likely that}} future projects will be approved regardless of the problems.|$|E

The constraint may change with time, so time t will appear explicitly in the constraint equations. At any instant of time, when t is a constant, any one coordinate will be determined from the other coordinates, e.g. if xk and zk are given, then so is yk. One constraint equation counts as one constraint. If there are C constraints, each has an equation, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be C constraint equations.

2500|$|What characterizes spinors and distinguishes {{them from}} {{geometric}} vectors and other tensors is subtle. [...] Consider applying a rotation to the coordinates of a system. [...] No {{object in the}} system itself has moved, only the coordinates have, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> always be a compensating change in those coordinate values when applied to any object of the system. [...] Geometrical vectors, for example, have components that will undergo the same rotation as the coordinates. [...] More broadly, any tensor associated with the system (for instance, the stress of some medium) also has coordinate descriptions that adjust to compensate for changes to the coordinate system itself. [...] Spinors do not appear at this level of the description of a physical system, when one is concerned only with the properties of a single isolated rotation of the coordinates. [...] Rather, spinors appear when we imagine that instead of a single rotation, the coordinate system is gradually (continuously) rotated between some initial and final configuration. [...] For any of the familiar and intuitive ("tensorial") quantities associated with the system, the transformation law {{does not depend on}} the precise details of how the coordinates arrived at their final configuration. [...] Spinors, on the other hand, are constructed {{in such a way that}} makes them sensitive to how the gradual rotation of the coordinates arrived there: they exhibit path-dependence. [...] It turns out that, for any final configuration of the coordinates, there are actually two ("topologically") inequivalent gradual (continuous) rotations of the coordinate system that result in this same configuration. [...] This ambiguity is called the homotopy class of the gradual rotation. [...] The belt trick puzzle (shown) famously demonstrates two different rotations, one through an angle of 2π and the other through an angle of 4π, having the same final configurations but different classes. [...] Spinors actually exhibit a sign-reversal that genuinely depends on this homotopy class. [...] This distinguishes them from vectors and other tensors, none of which can feel the class.|$|E
