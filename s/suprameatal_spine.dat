50|$|The bony {{portion of}} the ear canal is nearly 2 cm long and is {{directed}} inward and slightly forward: {{at the same time}} it forms a slight curve, so that the floor of the canal is convex upward. In sagittal section it presents an oval or elliptical shape with the long axis directed downward and slightly backward. Its anterior wall and floor and the lower part of its posterior wall are formed by the tympanic part; the roof and upper part of the posterior wall by the squama. Its inner end is closed, by the tympanic membrane which originates from the tympanic sulcus; the upper limit of its outer orifice is formed by the posterior root of the zygomatic process, immediately below which there is sometimes seen a small spine, the <b>suprameatal</b> <b>spine,</b> situated at the upper and posterior part of the orifice.|$|E
