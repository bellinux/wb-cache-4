25|$|Notable legal views include Sweden, where a 2005 {{report by}} the Swedish Animal Welfare Agency for the {{government}} expressed concern over the increase in reports of horse-ripping incidents. The agency believed current animal cruelty legislation was not sufficient in protecting animals from abuse and needed updating, but concluded that on balance it was not appropriate {{to call for a}} ban. In New Zealand, the 1989 Crimes Bill considered abolishing bestiality as a criminal offense, and instead viewing it as a mental health issue, but they did not, and people can still be prosecuted for it. Under Section 143 of the Crimes Act 1961, individuals can <b>serve</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> of seven years duration for animal sexual abuse and the offence is considered 'complete' in the event of 'penetration'. In Canada a clarification of the anti-bestiality law was made in 2016 which legalizes most forms of sexual contact with animals other than penetration.|$|E
