50|$|Inverted roller screws {{operate on}} the same {{principles}} of standard roller screws except that {{the function of the}} nut and screw is reversed in relation to the rollers. The rollers move axially within the nut, which is elongated to accommodate the full extent of <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> travel. The threaded portion of the <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> is limited to the threaded length of the rollers. The non-threaded portion of the <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> can be a smooth or non-cylindrical shape. The ring gear is replaced by gear teeth above and below the threaded portion of the <b>screw</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Screw: Screw jack, {{ball screw}} and roller screw {{actuators}} all {{operate on the}} principle of the simple machine known as the screw. By rotating the actuator's nut, the <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> moves in a line. By moving the <b>screw</b> <b>shaft,</b> the nut rotates.|$|E
50|$|Instrument quality <b>screw</b> <b>shafts</b> are {{typically}} precise to 250 nanometers per centimeter. They are produced on precision milling machines with optical {{distance measuring equipment}} and special tooling. Similar machines are used to produce optical lenses and mirrors. Instrument <b>screw</b> <b>shafts</b> are generally made of Invar, to prevent temperature from changing tolerances too much.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{the first}} precise screwshafts were {{produced}} by {{starting with a}} low precision screwshaft, and then lapping the shaft with several spring-loaded nut laps. By rearranging and inverting the nut laps, the lengthwise errors of the nuts and shaft were averaged. Then, the very repeatable shaft's pitch is measured against a distance standard. A similar process is sometimes used today to produce reference standard <b>screw</b> <b>shafts,</b> or master manufacturing <b>screw</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R

5|$|Dreadnoughts were {{propelled}} by {{two to four}} screw propellers. Dreadnought herself, and all British dreadnoughts, had <b>screw</b> <b>shafts</b> driven by steam turbines.

40|$|Objective— To compare acute {{fixation}} {{stability and}} insertion effort of cortex bone screws {{with and without}} a shaft inserted in lag fashion in equine metacarpal (metatarsal, MC(T) III) bone. Methods— Screw types with independent variables of screw diameter (4. 5 or 5. 5 mm) and shaft type (without shaft, with 20 -mm shaft, or with 25 -mm shaft) were studied. Bone specimens cut from distal equine MC(T) III condyles were used. After screw insertion in lag fashion into 2 bone blocks with an instrumented device, shear tests were conducted in a mechanical testing machine. Outcome variables of peak insertion torque, insertion energy, stiffness, yield strength, and displacement at 3 kN of load were compared. Results— The effects of screw design were substantial. <b>Screws</b> with <b>shaft</b> were 30 % to 40 % stiffer and 60 % to 70 % stronger than <b>screws</b> without <b>shaft.</b> <b>Screws</b> with <b>shaft</b> could tolerate 80 to 95 kg more force than <b>screws</b> without <b>shaft</b> before yielding. At 3 kN load, the displacement with <b>screws</b> with <b>shaft</b> was 55 % to 60 % of that with <b>screws</b> without <b>shaft.</b> <b>Screws</b> with a long shaft tended to perform better than those with a short shaft. There {{was no difference in}} the shear stiffness, shear yield strength, or shear displacement between the 2 screw diameters. Although larger diameter screws required more insertion effort, and screws with a short shaft required the most insertion energy, these differences were small. Conclusions— Cortex screws with a long shaft of 4. 5 - or 5. 5 -mm diameter provide better stability in equine MC(T) III condyle bone with less insertion effort compared with those with a short shaft or no shaft. Clinical Significance— Cortex bone <b>screws</b> with a <b>shaft</b> inserted in lag fashion should be considered for the fixation of equine MC(T) III condylar fractures...|$|R

50|$|A {{fly press}} {{is a type}} of screw press in which the <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> is driven by a {{flywheel}} or a pair of fly weights at the ends of a bar. The wheel can either be cranked by hand or driven by a motor using a friction coupling. The wheel is weighted so its momentum will maintain the motion of the shaft.|$|E
5000|$|A screw is a {{mechanism}} that converts rotational motion to linear motion, and a torque (rotational force) to a linear force. [...] It {{is one of}} the six classical simple machines. The most common form consists of a cylindrical shaft with helical grooves or ridges called threads around the outside. [...] The screw passes through a hole in another object or medium, with threads {{on the inside of the}} hole that mesh with the screw's threads. When the shaft of the screw is rotated relative to the stationary threads, the screw moves along its axis relative to the medium surrounding it; for example rotating a wood screw forces it into wood. In screw mechanisms, either the <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> can rotate through a threaded hole in a stationary object, or a threaded collar such as a nut can rotate around a stationary <b>screw</b> <b>shaft.</b> [...] Geometrically, a screw can be viewed as a narrow inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder.|$|E

50|$|That night, the {{commander}} attempted to surface to escape at full speed, but {{was detected by}} a new Japanese sonar. Two more tanks were blown and the sub surfaced at a 25° angle and engines were set to full speed.

5000|$|High-precision <b>screw</b> <b>shafts</b> are {{typically}} precise to one thousandth {{of an inch}} per foot (830 nanometers per centimeter) or better. They have historically been machined to gross shape, case hardened and then ground. The three step process is needed because high temperature machining distorts the work-piece. [...] Hard whirling is a recent (2008) precision machining technique that minimizes heating of the work, and can produce precision screws from case-hardened bar stock.|$|R
5000|$|A {{screw press}} {{is a type}} of machine press in which the ram is driven up and down by a screw. The <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> can be driven by a handle or a wheel. It works by using a coarse screw to convert the {{rotation}} of the handle or drive-wheel into a small downward movement of greater force. The overhead handle usually incorporates balls as flyweights. The weights helps to maintain the momentum and thrust of the tool {{to make it easier to}} operate.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{upon their}} lead angle, ball screws can be back-driven {{due to their}} low {{internal}} friction (i.e., the <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> can be driven linearly to rotate the ball nut). They are usually undesirable for hand-fed machine tools, as the stiffness of a servo motor is required to keep the cutter from grabbing the work and self-feeding, that is, where the cutter and workpiece exceed the optimum feedrate and effectively jam or crash together, ruining the cutter and workpiece. Cost is also a major factor as Acme screws are cheaper to manufacture.|$|E
50|$|The North Korean Central News Agency {{released}} an official {{response to the}} investigation on 28 May 2010, asserting, amongst other things, that it is unbelievable that part of a torpedo doing so much damage to a ship would survive: Besides, the assertion that the <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> and engine remained undamaged and unchanged in shape is also a laughing shock. Even U.S. and British {{members of the international}} investigation team, which had blindly backed the south Korean regime in its 'investigation', were perplexed at the exhibit in a glass box.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was decided}} to sail her to Alexandria, where there were {{suitable}} docking facilities, However she could not steer a straight course, and could not make more than 8 kn. She {{got as far as}} Suez Bay, but could not attempt the Suez Canal in that condition. Lt Cmdr Peter Keeble, an experienced diver and salvage expert, personally supervised the removal of her two inner <b>screw</b> <b>shafts</b> near the gland. The A-brackets holding the <b>shafts</b> and <b>screws</b> were also cut, dropping both <b>screws</b> and <b>shafts</b> to the bottom. Keeble had perfected available underwater cutting torches by combining British and Italian technology to cut away the thick propeller shafts. [...] She returned to the UK and was decommissioned in July 1945.|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} {{system is}} mainly {{composed of the}} thermal desorption unit (TDU) and the post-processing system, as shown in Fig.  1. The core of the experimental system is the TDU, which includes feeder, heating and desorption system, discharging and cooling system, steam generator and air locks. Heating and desorption device uses double screws to transport material, and the heating source adopts super-audio frequency electromagnetic induction heating. Inductive coils are arranged in both the barrel and two <b>screw</b> <b>shafts,</b> and temperatures are controlled independently.|$|R
2500|$|Most sources, e.g. Dobie {{state that}} [...] "Barbara's Gilmours cheese press {{can still be}} seen today at 'The Hill'", however the cheese press here is dated 1760 and she died in 1732. The design of the press, with a heavy 'lintel' stone having a <b>screwed</b> <b>shaft</b> passing through it {{attached}} to a frame, allowed the dead weight of the stone to be lowered onto the cheese progressively, improving the overall drainage of the whey and the firming up of the curd.|$|R
50|$|The Eastern Company {{began the}} task of {{completing}} the ship. Work recommenced in May and took longer than expected to complete. Brunel reported in June 1857 that once the screw, <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> and sternpost had been installed the ship would be ready for launching. However, the launch ways and cradles would not be ready in time since the contract for their construction had only been placed in January 1857. Under pressure from all sides, the lease of the shipyard costing £1,000 a month, and against his better judgement, Brunel agreed to launch the ship on 3 November 1857 to catch the high tide.|$|E
50|$|The term {{jackscrew}} is {{also used}} for the captive screws that draw the two parts of D-subminiature electrical connectors together and hold them mated. When unscrewed, they allow the connector halves to be taken apart. These small jackscrews may have ordinary screw heads or extended heads (also making them thumbscrews) that allow the user's fingers to turn the jackscrew. Furthermore, the head sometimes has an internal female thread, with the male externally threaded <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> extending from that. The threaded-head type {{can be used to}} panel-mount one connector and provide a means to attach the mating connector to the first connector.|$|E
50|$|The helix of a screw's thread can {{twist in}} two {{possible}} directions, {{which is known}} as handedness. Most screw threads are oriented so that when seen from above, the <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> {{moves away from the}} viewer (the screw is tightened) when turned in a clockwise direction. This is known as a right-handed (RH) thread, because it follows the right hand grip rule: when the fingers of the right hand are curled around the shaft in the direction of rotation, the thumb will point in the direction of motion of the shaft. Threads oriented in the opposite direction are known as left-handed (LH).|$|E
50|$|Six {{hardened}} steel wood screws passing through slightly oversize holes {{just in front}} of the pivot point stopped the bridge from being pulled towards the neck end of the guitar. The upper portion of the screws is smooth, not threaded. These six screws are often mistakenly assumed to be the pivot point rather than the hidden knife edge. This design works, in spite of the friction caused by the edges of the six holes sliding up and down the <b>screw</b> <b>shafts</b> when vibrato is applied.|$|R
50|$|Eumenine wasps are {{diverse in}} nest building. The {{different}} species may either use existing cavities (such as beetle tunnels in wood, abandoned nests of other Hymenoptera, or even man-made holes like old nail holes and <b>screw</b> <b>shafts</b> on electronic devices) that they modify in several degrees, or they construct their own either underground or exposed nests. The nest may {{have one or}} several individual brood cells. The most widely used building material is mud made of a mixture of soil and regurgitated water, but many species use chewed plant material, instead.|$|R
50|$|In May 1944 Nelson steamed to England {{to stage}} for the coming Normandy invasion. While moored {{alongside}} a tanker at Plymouth, England on 24 May, her port screw fouled a mooring buoy, causing extensive damage to the <b>screw</b> and <b>shaft.</b> Nelson was placed in drydock where the <b>screw</b> and <b>shaft,</b> deemed beyond repair, were removed. But the need for fighting ships {{was so great that}} Nelson got underway on 2 June with only a starboard screw. At Milford Haven she rendezvoused with a convoy, and by 8 June was in the Normandy assault area.|$|R
5000|$|In harbor at Rabaul on 11 November, a Mark 13 torpedo {{launched}} by a Grumman TBF Avenger aircraft hit Agano in the stern, bending {{one of her}} shafts and flooding four compartments. Rear Admiral Morikazu Osugi was also injured in the attack. The next day, Agano was taken under tow by her sister ship, [...] together with four destroyers, for repairs at Truk. However, {{a few hours after}} departure, the ships were sighted by the American submarine , which launched four torpedoes. Agano was struck again in the stern, damaging a second <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> and severely buckling several plates. Later that day, the accompanying destroyers fought off an attack by the submarine [...] using a four-hour-long depth charge barrage. Agano finally reached Truk on 16 November.|$|E
50|$|In April 1868, {{en route}} to New Zealand, one of the Alhambras engines broke down, and she was {{compelled}} to return to port to have the broken cylinder replaced; Langland’s Foundry Company took only five weeks to cast the new 4-ton cylinder. In mid-January 1869, she was passing Kent Group when her <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> broke, and despite the difficult conditions, the captain succeeded in making land near Cape Howe. From there, she was taken in tow by the Dandenong, but was once again placed in danger when the towline parted while the ships were coming through The Rip. The Alhambra cleared the reef inside of Shortland Bluff, and with the weather becoming hazy, she anchored off the Swanspit light. At 6am, she was again taken in tow by the Dandenong, and conveyed to Williamstown.|$|E
50|$|Many theatres were {{equipped}} with organ lifts (elevators), designed {{to raise the}} organ console to stage level for solos, and lower it into the pit for film accompaniment. Bartola also manufactured organ lifts, recognizable by their distinctive four posts—one at each corner of the lift, and topped by metallic spheres. The posts concealed the lift mechanism, and Bartola's four-post lift was {{of great interest to}} small to mid-sized theater builders because it sat flat on the orchestra pit floor without requiring excavation below the pit, or even the drilling of a central <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> into the floor. Many Barton organ consoles were installed on these lifts, to say nothing of consoles of other builders. Like all Bartola products, they were robustly constructed, and many remain in use today. One example of this lift unit for the Barton organ may be found at the 1927-era historic Temple Theatre in Saginaw, Michigan.|$|E

30|$|Thermal {{desorption}} {{should be}} carried out in an oxygen isolation environment, and air locks are installed at the feeding port and the discharge port of TDU. Before the experiment, steam is switched to device for purging and replacing the air inside. The feeding mode is intermittent, {{a certain amount of}} materials entered the air lock storage barrel first, then steam is opened to purge and replace the air mixed with feeding, and then materials are transferred into thermal desorption barrel. The discharging process {{is similar to that of}} the feeding. The barrel and two <b>screw</b> <b>shafts</b> are heated rapidly by induction heating, and materials can be heated rapidly during conveying. The total heating time of the material, that is, the heating residence time, is equal to the material conveying time.|$|R
