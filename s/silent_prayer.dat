5|$|Lennon's murder {{triggered}} {{an outpouring}} of grief {{around the world on}} an unprecedented scale. Lennon's remains were cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, Westchester County, N.Y.; no funeral was held. Ono sent word to the chanting crowd outside the Dakota that their singing had kept her awake; she asked that they re-convene at Central Park's Naumburg Bandshell the following Sunday for ten minutes of <b>silent</b> <b>prayer.</b> On 14 December 1980, {{millions of people around the}} world responded to Ono's request to pause for ten minutes of silence to remember Lennon. Thirty thousand gathered in Liverpool, and the largest group—over 225,000—converged on New York's Central Park, close to the scene of the shooting. For those ten minutes, every radio station in New York City went off the air.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} movement {{believes in}} a moral progression through reincarnation after death: the transmigration {{of the spirit}} in a human body only reflects the degree of spiritual elevation. The reincarnated person has no recollection of the past lives, and can again make progress in his spiritual course that allows him, at the end, to reach the divine state which releases him from the cycle of reincarnation. The harm caused by disease and by people is seen as a beneficial cure, as the pain can increase one's spiritual progress and thus contribute to one's salvation. The <b>silent</b> <b>prayer</b> is also considered as a way to connect the spirit to consciousness. Antoine, who suffered from disease and demonstrated asceticism and dedication throughout his life, is regarded by followers as a role model to attain salvation.|$|E

50|$|It is {{the act of}} {{offering}} the sutra, daimoku (the invocation Nam-myoho-renge-kyo), and <b>silent</b> <b>prayers</b> to the Gohonzon, the object of veneration. Offering the sutra entails reciting the Expedient Means (second) and the Life Span of the Tathagata (sixteenth) chapters of the Lotus Sutra; the <b>silent</b> <b>prayers</b> are five formal meditations expressing gratitude for the Three Treasures as defined in Nichiren Shoshu, and the merit accrued through Buddhist practices. Buddhist piety is a common sentiment found in Gongyo among Nichiren Shoshu members.|$|R

25|$|Many Reform congregations {{will often}} {{conclude}} with either Sim Shalom or Shalom Rav. Once {{either of those}} prayers are chanted or sung, many congregations proceed to {{a variation on the}} Mi Shebeirach (typically the version popularized by Debbie Friedman), the traditional prayer for healing, followed by <b>silent</b> <b>prayer,</b> and then a resumption of the service.|$|E
25|$|In the Anglican tradition, {{confession}} and absolution {{is usually a}} component part of corporate worship, particularly at services of the Holy Eucharist. The form involves an exhortation to repentance by the priest, a period of <b>silent</b> <b>prayer</b> during which believers may inwardly confess their sins, a form of general confession said together by all present and the pronouncement of general absolution by the priest, often accompanied by {{the sign of the}} cross.|$|E

25|$|Following his record-setting {{successes in}} the U.S. and Canada, Taylor {{agreed to a}} European tour. In 1901, Taylor made {{his first trip to}} Europe, but {{returned}} to compete in the U.S. after the conclusion of the European spring racing season. During his European tour Taylor still refused to race on Sundays, when most of the finals were held, because of his religious convictions. It was reported that Taylor took a Bible with him when he traveled and began each race with a <b>silent</b> <b>prayer</b> because of his religious beliefs.|$|E
25|$|George and Madeline took a kind {{but firm}} {{approach}} in rearing their children, encouraging {{hard work and}} regular schedules. In his autobiography, White relates that his parents ran a strict schedule on Sundays; they locked him in his room for <b>silent</b> <b>prayer,</b> a time so boring that he almost begged to do homework. His father forbade Walter from reading any books less than 25 years old so he chose to read Dickens, Thackeray, and Trollope {{by the time he}} was 12. When he was 8, he threw a rock at a white child who called him a derogatory name for drinking from the fountain reserved for blacks. Events such as this shaped White's self-identity. He began to develop skills to pass for white, which he used later to preserve his safety as a civil rights investigator for the NAACP in the South.|$|E
25|$|In Queensland on 10 January 1916 Canon David John Garland was {{appointed}} the honorary {{secretary of the}} Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland (ADCCQ) at a public meeting which endorsed 25 April as be the date promoted as “Anzac Day” in 1916 and ever after. Devoted {{to the cause of}} a non-denominational commemoration that could be attended by the whole of Australian society, Garland worked amicably across all denominational divides, creating the framework for Anzac Day commemorative services. Garland is specifically credited with initiating the Anzac Day march, the wreath-laying ceremonies at memorials and the special church services, the two minutes silence, and the luncheon for returned soldiers. Garland intended the silence was used in lieu of a prayer to allow the Anzac Day service to be universally attended, allowing attendees to make a <b>silent</b> <b>prayer</b> or remembrance in accordance with their own beliefs. He particularly feared that the universality of the ceremony would fall victim to religious sectarian disputes.|$|E

500|$|Eddy and 26 {{followers}} {{founded the}} Christian Science church in 1879 in Boston, Massachusetts, following {{the publication of}} Eddy's book Science and Health (1875). In the book Eddy argued that disease is a mental error rather than a physical disorder, and {{that it should be}} treated not by medicine, but by a form of <b>silent</b> <b>prayer</b> that corrects the mistaken beliefs. Her ideas were not new, she said; on the contrary, the church sought to [...] "reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing".|$|E
500|$|Antoinist beliefs combine some {{elements}} of Catholicism, reincarnation, and healing. In the Antoinist views, the man must reach consciousness by {{getting rid of the}} illusion of matter produced by his intelligence—the source of evil and suffering. The purpose of the life is to release oneself from the cycle of reincarnation through a moral progression aided by [...] "fluids"—all human actions, acquired by <b>silent</b> <b>prayer</b> and the harm caused by diseases and enemies. As freedom of conscience and free will are considered very important in Antoinist creed, the religion does not practice proselytism and is not exclusive. It does not provide any prescription on social issues. Although focused on healing, Antoinism does not interfere with the medical field, and does not discourage the resort to traditional medicine.|$|E
500|$|The Sages of the Talmud {{stated that}} anyone who prays at the Temple in Jerusalem, [...] "it is {{as if he has}} prayed before the throne of glory because the gate of heaven is {{situated}} there and it is open to hear prayer." [...] Jewish Law stipulates that the <b>Silent</b> <b>Prayer</b> should be recited facing towards Jerusalem, the Temple and ultimately the Holy of Holies, as God's bounty and blessing emanates from that spot. It is generally believed that prayer by the Western Wall is particularly beneficial since it was that wall which was situated closest to the Holy of Holies. Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger writes [...] "since the gate of heaven is near the Western Wall, it is understandable that all Israel's prayers ascend on high there... {{as one of the great}} ancient kabbalists Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla said, when the Jews send their prayers from the Diaspora in the direction of Jerusalem, from there they ascend by way of the Western Wall." [...] A well-known segula (efficacious remedy) for finding one's soulmate is to pray for 40 consecutive days at the Western Wall, a practice apparently conceived by Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Fisher.|$|E

500|$|According to the hagiography of Theodore of Syceon, Domentziolus {{was married}} to a lady named Irene, and had three sons. Elizabeth Dawes {{summarizes}} the tale given as following: [...] "Domnitziolus, patrician and curopalates, asks Theodore to visit him in Arcadianae. His wife Eirene has no children: the saint blesses her and promises her three children - and they will be boys. All the male and female slaves of the household are brought to Theodore for his blessing. A slave girl had long been ill, troubled by a hidden demon. He beats on her breast and the demon declares itself. Then the Saint laying her on the ground Put his foot on her neck, turned his eyes to the east and uttered a <b>silent</b> <b>prayer.</b> At the end of his prayer he recited aloud the doxology of the Holy Trinity. For some time the slave girl remained speechless and then was completely cured. Later Eirene gave birth to three sons, as the Saint had prophesied. The conception of her first son immediately followed the Saint's prayer. Emperor and Patriarch say farewell to Theodore and he returns to his monastery." [...] Since Theodore died by 613, the tale would have to occur prior to this date.|$|E
500|$|In 1981, Reagan {{became the}} first {{president}} to propose a constitutional amendment on school prayer. Reagan's election reflected an opposition to the 1962 Supreme Court case Engel v. Vitale, prohibiting state officials from composing an official state prayer and requiring that it be recited in the public schools. Reagan's 1981 proposed amendment stated: [...] "Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to prohibit individual or group prayer in public schools or other public institutions. No person shall be required by the United States or by any state to participate in prayer." [...] In 1984, Reagan again raised the issue, asking Congress [...] "why can't [...] freedom to acknowledge God be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across this land?" [...] In 1985, Reagan expressed his disappointment that the Supreme Court ruling still bans {{a moment of silence}} for public schools, and said he had [...] "an uphill battle." [...] In 1987 Reagan renewed his call for Congress to support voluntary prayer in schools and end [...] "the expulsion of God from America's classrooms." [...] Critics argue that any governmental imposition of prayer on public school students is involuntary. No Supreme Court rulings suggest that students cannot engage in <b>silent</b> <b>prayer</b> on their own. During his term in office, Reagan campaigned vigorously to restore organized prayer to the schools, first as a moment of prayer and later as a Moment of Silence.|$|E

5000|$|The Presanctified Liturgy, {{aside from}} having no {{anaphora}} (eucharistic prayer) is structured much like other vesperal divine liturgies that are prescribed for strict fast days.

2500|$|The {{guideline}} of <b>silent</b> <b>prayer</b> {{comes from}} Hannah's behavior during prayer, when she prayed in the Temple {{to bear a}} child. She prayed [...] "speaking upon her heart," [...] {{so that no one}} else could hear, yet her lips were moving. Therefore, when saying the Amidah one's voice should be audible to oneself, but not loud enough for others to hear.|$|E
2500|$|Conservative and Reform congregations {{sometimes}} abbreviate {{the public}} recitation of the Amidah by saying it once, {{with the first}} three blessings said out loud and the remainder silently. This abridged style, {{commonly referred to as}} (...) [...] "heikhe kedusha," [...] is also performed within Orthodox Judaism in certain circumstances; in some communities it is customary for mincha to be recited in this way. It is usually used to lead into the <b>Silent</b> <b>Prayer.</b>|$|E
