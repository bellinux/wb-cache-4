50|$|The {{plates are}} often spaced by rubber <b>sealing</b> <b>gaskets</b> which are {{cemented}} into a section {{around the edge}} of the plates. The plates are pressed to form troughs at right angles to the direction of flow of the liquid which runs through the channels in the heat exchanger. These troughs are arranged so that they interlink with the other plates which forms the channel with gaps of 1.3 - 1.5 mm between the plates. The plates are compressed together in a rigid frame to form an arrangement of parallel flow channels with alternating hot and cold fluids. The plates produce an extremely large surface area, which allows for the fastest possible transfer. Making each chamber thin ensures that the majority of the volume of the liquid contacts the plate, again aiding exchange. The troughs also create and maintain a turbulent flow in the liquid to maximize heat transfer in the exchanger. A high degree of turbulence can be obtained at low flow rates and high heat transfer coefficient can then be achieved.|$|E

The effect of contact with can coatings, <b>sealing</b> <b>gaskets</b> and the epoxidised oils used in gasket manufacture on furan formation was studied. The objective was to identify factors affecting furan formation. Furan present in heat-processed food samples persisted during cooking. Furan was shown to form in foods on heating, although it did not accumulate to a significant degree on heating in an open vessel. There were no interactions between foods and cans, can coatings or gaskets that had a significant influence on furan formation. Furan accumulated particularly in heat-processed canned and jarred foods because they are sealed containers that receive a considerable thermal load. Heating epoxidised oils used in <b>sealing</b> <b>gaskets</b> formed furan. At the levels used in gaskets, however, epoxidised oils should not affect the formation of furan in foods...|$|E

40|$|The seismic {{vulnerability}} assessment of tunnels is generally based on empirical fragility curves. They {{are derived from}} the statistical analysis of observed damages in past earthquakes. Some authors have calculated fragility curves {{based on the results}} of numerical analyses, defining the damage index in terms of ratio between the flexural demand and capacity of the structural section of the tunnel lining. However, the tunnel lining is generally assumed as a continuous ring, while in the case of mechanized tunneling it is made of jointed segments. Recent studies modeling with FEA the non-linear dynamic interaction between the segmental lining and the soil have shown the significant effect of the jointed pattern of a segmental lining. On one hand, it implies a lower structural demand than a continuous ring, due to its larger flexibility and compressibility in the transverse section; on the other hand, permanent rotations of the joints are often calculated at the end of the earthquake, that may represent a further structural fragility of a segmental lining, since they may produce dislocation of <b>sealing</b> <b>gaskets</b> among segments. Limited available post-earthquake reconnaissance, would seem to indicate that in some cases damage at the segments joints has been observed. In this study, a set of FEA was carried out using a strain hardening elastic-plastic model with small strain overlay. Several input signals were used and different ground conditions were modelled in order to define fragility curves for damage associated to joint permanent rotation in a segmental tunnel lining. The results are presented and discussed in the paper...|$|E
30|$|Taking the {{advantages}} of low and high temperatures, low and high pressures and corrosion, the metal <b>sealing</b> <b>gaskets</b> are suitable for oil-gas exploitation, chemical industry and nuclear industry, where rubber seals are prohibited [12]. SPMC is a static metal seal without gasket, and the optimal sealing performance is the key technology. Up to now the researches of the pipeline connection are extensive, but few of them focus {{on the design of}} connector without gasket. In the design of a connector with gasket, the gasket factor and minimum gasket seating stress should be determined according to the design codes [13, 14] subject to gasket material and structural. These codes are based on a series of assumptions and might not define calculation procedures for sealing performance in detail [15]. Persson [16] and Kazeminia et al. [17] revaluated the leakage of metallic seal, which was used to design bolted flanged connections. Zhao et al. [18], established the mathematical relationship between the contact stress of metal sealing ring governing the sealing performance, the structural parameters and operating pressure, but did not consider the plastic deformation of metallic gasket. Sawa et al. [19] and Takaki et al. [20] studied the contact pressure on the sealing surface by elastic-plastic finite element analysis with regard of nonlinearity of gasket and internal pressure. However, the analysis is for the spiral wound gasket only. Nitta et al. [21], analyzed the critical contact pressure to eliminate the radial leakage paths by the quantitative analysis of the leakage, but did not discover the critical contact pressure to fully block the leakage paths. Using a finite element analysis approach, Joshi et al. [22], and Abid et al. [23] studied the flange connection without gasket, which concluded surface profiles, thickness of flange and bolt pre-stress had effects on the stress in the flange and bolts as well as flange rotation and displacement, but the effects on sealing performance wasn’t investigated. Guindani et al. [24], studied the deformation recovery of sealing material and optimized the sealing performance of rubber. Bouzid et al. [25] and Wu et al. [26] proved the mean contact pressure and its distribution on sealing surface took important effects on sealing performance. By finite element analysis and experiment, Noga et al. [27] proved the suitable contact pressure and width of plastic deformation were the key parameters to guarantee the sealing performance of flange connection without gasket. However, the critical values of contact pressure and plastic deformation are not investigated. According to the above researches, the right contact pressure will make the plastic deformation happen on sealing surface and block micro leakage paths. Therefore, the contact pressure is essential for the optimal sealing performance of SPMC.|$|E

The structure, material, {{production}} and application situation of metal winding gasket were summarized, and the preparation technology and product properties of metal winding gasket were analyzed. The results showed: {{under the same}} gasket stress, the leakage rate increased {{with the increase of}} medium pressure; Under the same medium pressure, the leakage rate declined with the increase of the gasket stress.
