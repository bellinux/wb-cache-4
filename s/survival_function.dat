This paper considers estimation and model selection for these semiparametric multivariate <b>survival</b> <b>functions,</b> allowing for misspecified parametric copulas and data subject to general censoring. We first establish convergence of the two-step estimator of the copula parameter to the pseudo-true value defined as {{the value of the}} parameter that minimizes the KLIC between the parametric copula induced multivariate density and the unknown true density. We then derive its root [...] n asymptotically normal distribution and provide a simple consistent asymptotic variance estimator by accounting for the impact of the nonparametric estimation of the marginal <b>survival</b> <b>functions.</b> These results are used to establish the asymptotic distribution of the penalized pseudo-likelihood ratio statistic for comparing multiple semiparametric multivariate <b>survival</b> <b>functions</b> subject to copula misspecification and general censorship.

40|$|Abstract Background During {{the last}} part of the 1990 s the chance of {{surviving}} breast cancer increased. Changes in <b>survival</b> <b>functions</b> reflect a mixture of effects. Both, the introduction of adjuvant treatments and early screening with mammography played a role in the decline in mortality. Evaluating the contribution of these interventions using mathematical models requires <b>survival</b> <b>functions</b> before and after their introduction. Furthermore, required <b>survival</b> <b>functions</b> may be different by age groups and are related to disease stage at diagnosis. Sometimes detailed information is not available, as was the case for the region of Catalonia (Spain). Then one may derive the functions using information from other geographical areas. This work presents the methodology used to estimate age- and stage-specific Catalan breast cancer <b>survival</b> <b>functions</b> from scarce Catalan survival data by adapting the age- and stage-specific US functions. Methods Cubic splines were used to smooth data and obtain continuous hazard rate functions. After, we fitted a Poisson model to derive hazard ratios. The model included time as a covariate. Then the hazard ratios were applied to US <b>survival</b> <b>functions</b> detailed by age and stage to obtain Catalan estimations. Results We started estimating the hazard ratios for Catalonia versus the USA before and after the introduction of screening. The hazard ratios were then multiplied by the age- and stage-specific breast cancer hazard rates from the USA to obtain the Catalan hazard rates. We also compared breast cancer survival in Catalonia and the USA in two time periods, before cancer control interventions (USA 1975 – 79, Catalonia 1980 – 89) and after (USA and Catalonia 1990 – 2001). Survival in Catalonia in the 1980 – 89 period was worse than in the USA during 1975 – 79, but the differences disappeared in 1990 – 2001. Conclusion Our results suggest that access to better treatments and quality of care contributed to large improvements in survival in Catalonia. On the other hand, we obtained detailed breast cancer <b>survival</b> <b>functions</b> that will be used for modeling the effect of screening and adjuvant treatments in Catalonia. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a unified data-driven prognostic framework that combines failure time data, static parameter data and dynamic (time-series) data. The approach employs Cox {{proportional hazards model}} (Cox PHM) and soft dynamic multiple fault diagnosis algorithm (DMFD) for inferring the degraded state trajectories of components and to estimate their remaining useful life (RUL). This framework {{takes into account the}} cross-subsystem fault propagation, a case prevalent in any networked and embedded system. The key idea is to use Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the <b>survival</b> <b>functions</b> of error codes and symptoms (soft test outcomes/prognostic indicators) from failure time data and static parameter data, and use them to infer the <b>survival</b> <b>functions</b> of components via a soft DMFD algorithm. The average remaining useful life and its higher-order central moments (e. g., variance, skewness, kurtosis) can be estimated from these component <b>survival</b> <b>functions.</b> The proposed prognostic framework {{has the potential to be}} applicable to a wide variety of systems, ranging from automobiles to aerospace systems...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the past}} years, Hidden Markov Models {{have been used}} in several fields and {{applications}} with success. More recently, these models have been applied to improve the reliability of a machinery system. In many cases, failure is preceded by specific sequences of events (signature), which can be detected by an adequate Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Classical laws like lifetime models or <b>survival</b> <b>functions</b> are used to estimate the lifetime of a system. The default of these laws is that only the elapsed time is used to estimate the end of life of a system. The aim {{of this paper is to}} validate an HMM approach. We first use a synthetic HMM model of degradation to produce event sequences. This synthetic model has been inspired by a real process. In this case, we can adjust the failure rate by changing model parameters. All the parameters of this synthetic model are known and provide references which can be evaluated by different indicators. Classical <b>survival</b> <b>functions</b> used in reliability are computed on synthetic sequences. These laws validate the behavior of the synthetic model. The higher the failure rate, the shorter the lifetime duration. These results confirm that a four-state, left to right, HMM topology can represent the degradation level of a system. In a second time, this HMM approach is used in a real case, where degradation levels are unknown. Degradation estimates are compared with the results from classical <b>survival</b> <b>functions</b> used in the first case. Then we show that the degradation level provided by the HMM approach is more efficient than the <b>survival</b> <b>functions</b> approach. The HMM approach takes into account the events collected about a system, not only the elapsed time as is the case with <b>survival</b> <b>functions...</b>|$|R
