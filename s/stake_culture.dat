In Cambodia, we say: 'When culture vanishes, the nation collapses.' How can we build our country if culture remains confined to survival when transmission of memory's so much at <b>stake?</b> <b>Culture</b> should be a priority {{because it is so}} instrumental in healing our wounds, overcoming traumas and building democracy. The situation of the burnt theatre serves as a symbol of Cambodia's situation, just as of many other developing countries'. Are we to reduce culture to its folklore dimension? And yet… To break away with 'culture of survival', and overcome stupor of trauma, we need a link, we need continuity. Artists embody such a link. Through creations, they can avoid breaking up with our past, they can restore dignity of memory." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Increasingly, the {{viability}} of university programs to develop in school leaders the knowledge, skills and dispositions needed to bring about reform are being questioned. This article uses case study methodology for looking at how an increasing emphasis on collaborative inquiry in one university’s program influenced a school principal several years after that principal had completed his master’s degree program in educational leadership. The principal explains his approach to accountability and how he engages teachers in inquiry around closing the achievement gap. How can school principals use the high <b>stakes</b> accountability <b>culture</b> of today’s schools to leverage engagement around practices in need of reform? There is no denying that in California schools today, principals feel enormous pressure from No Child Left Behind (NCLB) (2001) and the California Public Schools Accountability Act (1999) to bring about changes that will improve the outcomes for students, particularly {{students who are not}} performing well academically. The statistics of who is not achieving have changed little {{over the last two decades}} (Hoff, 2000...|$|R
40|$|It {{is natural}} for someone looking in on a foreign culture {{from the outside}} to {{interpret}} what they see and frame their reactions {{based on their own}} background and assumptions. With cultures as a different as those of the Middle East and the West, the potential for blunders increases dramatically, made worse by the high political, diplomatic, military, and commercial <b>stakes</b> involved. Leadership <b>culture</b> in this region has been shaped over centuries through a variety of factors, such as reputation, family, and religion, which continue to influence decision making. The present study posits that an understanding of these factors and how they work is crucial for intelligence analysts, policy and decision makers, strategists, and scholars who must find their way through a very unfamiliar cultural landscape in the Middle East. It is hoped that this discussion will in some way assist in the creation of more effective interaction, policies, and analysis associated with the Middle East...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn Turkey as elsewhere, {{exchanges and}} circulations played an {{important}} role in the construction of national culture and the way of conceiving the role of culture and cultural policies. Nowaday, the debates on cultural policy are renewed in the context of globalisation or of the negotiation for Turkey’s adhesion to the European Union. In parallel, culture has now a great economic dimension and is more and more used as a tool of development, of growth, or of tourism. The initiatives aiming to encourage ‘democratization’, ‘cultural diversity’, or the localisation of cultural policies also go hand in hand with. One witnesses a diversification of actors involved in the making of cultural policies (private, associative, international); one also witnesses the circulation of objects, ideas, instruments, or practices and modes of action, bringing together new <b>stakes</b> for <b>culture</b> and cultural policies. This contribution aims to question the ways in which the circulations participate in the construction of cultural policies in Turkey today in order to rethink the co-production of cultural policies, of their spaces and territories, as well as the plurality of the conceptions of culture carried by cultural policies. It is also a way of deconstructing the operations of transfer of policies and to question the “models” of cultural policies, the “best practices”, the phenomena of cultural co-operations, or of translations. cette communication analyse l'évolution de la politique culturelle turque ces dernières années à la suite d'un certain nombre de réformes initiées par le gouvernement de l'AKP. Alors que les politiques culturelles de la République turque ont longtemps obéit à l'objectif du "nation buiding", ces réformes ont étéconduites au nom d'un modèle d'inspiration britannique. il s'agira de mesurer la réalité de la mise en oeuvre de ce modèle, ses effets chez les créateurs et sur le public. La plupart des projets initiés sont contestés par les organisations professionnelles et les artistes qui dénoncent un interventionnisme autoritaire menaçant leur liberté de création...|$|R
40|$|Previously, video {{production}} was a skill set practiced by trained individuals, but new technologies {{have opened the}} doors so that anyone can be a filmmaker. This paper explores the history and conceptual foundations of participatory video (PV), and offers a reflective perspective on its applicability as a teaching and learning tool. A review of a PV training in Uganda is featured to highlight the methodology used in practice and the challenges faced. The authors propose that an approach to PV which combines the best existing practices with a closer alignment to its foundational prin-ciples is worthy of further research. I n his study Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21 st Century, Jenkins (2009) writes, “We are moving away from {{a world in which}} some produce and many consume media toward one in which everyone has a more active <b>stake</b> in the <b>culture</b> that is produced ” (p. 12). Participatory video (PV), a technique used with increasing frequency in education and development, can act as a unique catalyst for learning and expression. The underlying principles of PV are also congruent with the vision of many theorists who sought to develop alterna-tives to the dominant educational paradigm; in particular, Freire (1970), who differ...|$|R
