Such tasks follow a [...] "compose and forward" [...] model, where the user {{specifies}} all of the required data for the <b>service</b> <b>request,</b> which is then forwarded to the actual service when the client reconnects. Examples {{of this type of}} task are: composing an e-mail, composing a meeting request, and entering order information. All of these tasks are discrete items that the user can complete offline and that result in a single <b>service</b> <b>request.</b>|$|E

40|$|When {{meeting the}} {{challenges}} in automatic and semi-automatic Web service composition, capturing the user’s service demand and preferences {{is as important as}} knowing what the services can do. This paper discusses the idea of semantic <b>service</b> <b>requests</b> for composite <b>services,</b> and presents a multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) based model of composite <b>service</b> <b>requests.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>requests</b> are modeled as user preferences and constraints. Two preference structures, additive independence and generalized additive independence, are utilized in calculating the expected utilities of service composition outcomes. The model is also based on an iterative and incremental scheme meant to better capture requirements in accordance with service consumers’ needs. OWL-S markup vocabularies and associated inference mechanism are used as a means to bring semantics to <b>service</b> <b>requests.</b> Ontology conceptualizations and language constructs are added to OWL-S as uniform representations of possible aspects of the requests. This model of semantics in <b>service</b> <b>requests</b> enables unambiguous understanding of the service needs and more precise generation of the desired compositions. An application scenario is presented to illustrate how the proposed model can be applied in the real business world...|$|R
