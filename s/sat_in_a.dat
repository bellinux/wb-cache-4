5|$|Mellor's {{work was}} {{represented}} in the first National Indigenous Art Triennial in 2007, with the elaborate (and elaborately named) sculpture The contrivance of a vintage Wonderland (A magnificent flight of curious fancy for science buffs, a china ark of seductive whimsy, a divinely ordered special attraction, upheld in multifariousness) featuring a diorama that included sculpted kangaroos made with blue and white crockery fragments (evoking Spode bone china), real kangaroo skin (used for the ears and paws), and synthetic eyeballs; stuffed birds <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> life-sized mixed-media tree overhead. The work featured in media reports of the exhibition, including by The Adelaide Advertiser, The Canberra Times, The West Australian and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Without a role or rank, Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark, {{becoming}} moody and listless. A spinal injury sustained {{during the}} war, {{for which he}} had to wear a corset, remained unhealed. In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. According to Harriet von Rathlef, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner and sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if only because she was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.|$|E

5|$|Cameron {{wanted his}} pitch for Daly to {{finalize}} {{the deal and}} had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator. Henriksen, wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts on his face, and gold foil on his teeth, kicked {{open the door to}} the office and then <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chair. Cameron arrived shortly after which relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film. In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion. The Terminator was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million. Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{football}} was Atlanta's one major sports franchise {{during this time}} frame. To hold a ticket to watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly valued and was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> folding chair at a card table on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took his seat and left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays to be run and the designated players to run them. Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as on a Saturday in Athens when Georgia Tech {{was about to be}} upset. Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a pass for a touchdown and returned to the bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field was a kind of unbruising football other coaches couldn't understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; rarely a classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use of it than Dodd.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, the Comos {{celebrated their}} silver wedding anniversary {{with a family}} trip to Italy. On the {{itinerary}} was an audience with Pope Pius XII. Como, who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> side wing of the Long Island church where he attended Sunday Mass {{in an effort to}} avoid attracting attention, was both puzzled and upset on returning home that photos from the visit made the newspapers throughout the world. A thorough check of both the Como and NBC publicity offices found that neither was responsible for the release of the photos to the media; it was done by the Vatican's press department. When Perry and Roselle became Knight Commander and Lady Commander of the Equestrian Order of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in 1952, it was a news item only after Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, who had been honored at the same ceremony, mentioned it some time later.|$|E

5|$|Only Roman {{citizens}} (both plebeians and patricians) had {{the right}} to confer magisterial powers (potestas) on any individual magistrate. The most important power was imperium, which was held by consuls (the chief magistrates) and by praetors (the second highest-ranking ordinary magistrate). Defined narrowly, imperium simply gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force. Defined more broadly, however, imperium gave a magistrate the constitutional authority to issue commands (military, diplomatic, civil, or otherwise). A magistrate's imperium was at its apex while the magistrate was abroad. While the magistrate was in the city of Rome itself, however, he had to completely surrender his imperium, so that liberty (libertas) was maximized. Magistrates with imperium <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> curule chair, and were attended by lictors (bodyguards) who carried axes called fasces which symbolized {{the power of the state}} to punish and to execute. Only a magistrate with imperium could wear a bordered toga, or be awarded a triumph.|$|E
5|$|Performing live again brought Como a {{new sense}} of enjoyment. In May 1974, he {{embarked}} on his first concert appearance outside of the United States, a show at the London Palladium for the Variety Club of Great Britain to aid children's charities. It was here where he discovered what he had been missing when the audience cheered for ten minutes after he walked onstage. At the show's end, Como <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chair, delightedly chatting back and forth with his equally delighted fans. Perry returned to the United Kingdom in November for a Royal Variety Performance to benefit the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund with the Queen Mother in attendance. Como was invited to visit Buckingham Palace the day after the show. At first, the invitation did not extend to his associates traveling and working with him, and Como politely declined. When word reached the Palace regarding the reason for Perry's turning down the invitation, it was then extended to include all in the Como party and Como accepted this invitation. Soon after, he announced his first concert tour that began in the UK in the spring of 1975.|$|E
5|$|The Fraternity's rituals {{at their}} Bayswater temple {{were carried out}} under a dim light, with Fortune {{claiming}} that bright light disperses etheric forces. An altar {{was placed in the}} centre of a room, with the colours of the altar-cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed. A light was placed on the altar while incense, usually frankincense, was burned. The senior officers <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row along the eastern end of the room, while officers—who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces—were positioned at various positions on the floor. The lodge was opened by walking around the room in a circle chanting, with the intent of building a psychic force up as a wall. Next, the cosmic entities would be invoked, with the members believing that these entities would manifest in astral form and interact with the chosen officers.|$|E

5|$|The car {{scene with}} Gillian Anderson and Annabeth Gish {{was shot at}} Kanan Road, Malibu. Anderson and Gish sat in {{what is known as}} an insert car, while the crew <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pickup car in front of them. The birth scene was filmed at the old Paramount Movie Ranch. According to {{director}} Kim Manners, the most difficult scene to shoot was in the elevator with Mitch Pileggi and Nicholas Lea. Gish had never worked much with guns before joining The X-Files cast, so the producers got a retired LAPD officer to teach her more about firearms. She did some shooting practices before returning to the set. The FBI garage scenes were shot in Century City and took a total of four days to finish.|$|E
5|$|Tommy Docherty was {{appointed}} manager in 1971 {{and had a}} brief, but successful, time in charge. Docherty lost only three of his 12 matches as manager, but he left the job in late 1972 to become manager of Manchester United. Despite losing 5–0 to England in his first match in charge, Scotland qualified for the 1974 World Cup under the management of Willie Ormond. Scotland performed creditably at the finals, winning against Zaire and drawing against Brazil and Yugoslavia, but were eliminated on goal difference. Ormond suffered from player indiscipline during his tenure, which included an infamous incident where Jimmy Johnstone, after a night out drinking, <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rowing boat that was drifting out to sea. Two teammates attempted to rescue Johnstone, but eventually {{he had to be}} retrieved by local fishermen. Ormond left the Scotland job in 1977 to become manager of Hearts.|$|E
5|$|Alice's birth {{prompted}} {{her parents}} to find a larger family home. Buckingham Palace was not equipped with the private apartments that Victoria's growing family needed, including suitable nurseries. Therefore, in 1844, Victoria and Albert purchased Osborne House on the Isle of Wight as a family holiday home. Alice's education was devised by her father and his close friend, Baron Stockmar. At Osborne, Alice and her siblings were taught practical skills such as housekeeping, cooking, gardening and carpentry, as well as daily lessons in English, French and German. Victoria and Albert favoured a monarchy based on family values; Alice and her siblings, who wore middle class clothing on a daily basis, slept in sparsely furnished bedrooms with little heating. Alice was fascinated with the world outside the Royal Household; at Balmoral, where she seemed happiest, she visited the tenants living and working on the estate. On one occasion, she escaped from her governess at the chapel at Windsor Castle and <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> public pew, so she could better understand {{people who were not}} strict adherents to royal protocol. In 1854, during the Crimean War, the eleven-year-old Alice toured London hospitals for wounded soldiers with her mother and her eldest sister. She was the most emotionally sensitive of her siblings and was sympathetic to other people's burdens, possessing a sharp tongue and an easily triggered temper. In her childhood, Alice formed a close relationship with her brother, the Prince of Wales, and her eldest sister, The Princess Royal. Victoria's marriage to Prince Frederick of Prussia in 1858 greatly upset her.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} premièred on August 26, 2010 on Vevo, and was {{directed}} by Hiro Murai. The video begins in a club environment, with misplaced furniture and a shattered glass bottle. The scene goes in reverse motion, people instantly appear, frozen in a raving action. As the scene is still reversing a DJ is spinning his booth, and the shattered glass bottle forms into its original state, the clubbers and the scene then start to move in forward but slow motion and the song begins with Usher approaching from a set of stairs. Usher sings and dances, whilst moving past clubbers who are still moving in slow motion whilst he is in moving normally. Once the chorus comes in, the clubbers begin dancing and raving in normal motion, periodically slowing down; Usher is krumping pass them, {{moving on to the}} next scene. Usher slides into a room with a large lit up window as a back drop. He performs choreography backed-up by female dancers for the second verse, and then returns to the original room with the second chorus coming in. A similar scene is involved to the first chorus, but this time Usher is dancing with the clubbers, who are still alternating in motion speed. Pitbull then begins his verse, and is <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> V.I.P. area with three females, with the camera alternating between him, the clubbers and Usher. The video ends with its final scene, in a dance off, with Usher dancing adjacent to some of the clubbers. Once the climax of the chorus comes in, Usher jumps in the air and starts freely dancing along with the clubbers, with everyone in the same motion speed; Usher is primarily crip-walking. Usher and the clubbers then perform a final organised choreography, mainly krumping, and the video ends.|$|E

25|$|Tensions between {{settlers}} and local Māori began {{as early as}} July 1842, when settlers who had taken up land north of the Waitara River were driven from their farms. A year later 100 men, women and children <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> surveyors' path to disrupt the surveying of land for sale.|$|E
50|$|In basic construction, the {{different}} variants were otherwise almost identical, as largely conventional monoplanes with high, strut-braced wings and fixed, tailskid undercarriage. The pilot {{and one or}} two passengers <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> extensively-glazed, enclosed cabin.|$|R
25|$|The pilot <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open cockpit {{placed at}} the top of the aircraft. Visibility was {{restricted}} downward by the wing. The Batwing was the first example of a cantilevered wing designed and built in the United States.|$|R
60|$|Thomasin <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> inner {{room and}} heard Venn's voice. When {{customers}} were present she seldom showed herself, owing to her inherent dislike for the business; but perceiving {{that no one}} else was there tonight she came out.|$|R
25|$|Theoretically, a girl {{received}} suitors at a faikava, or kava-drinking gathering. She {{presided over}} the bowl, made the kava, and handed out the cups. The suitors <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> circle around the bowl, chatting, bragging, arguing, and showing off for the demure young lady. All was done under {{the eye of the}} elders, thus protecting the maiden from any unseemly advances.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft's pilot sat {{in an open}} cockpit {{above the}} leading edge of the wing. One gunner sat in the nose {{operating}} two machine guns, a second gunner <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dorsal position with two more machine guns, while another crewman operated a ventral gun, firing through a hatch. Two fixed machine guns could be operated by the pilot. Two Mikulin M-17 engines powered the ANT-21, as used by the ANT-7.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the psychic}} Edgar Cayce, whose syntax when {{speaking}} in trance was antiquated and convoluted, Roberts' syntax and sentence structures were modern and clear when speaking as Seth. Roberts often <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rocking chair during sessions, {{and she would}} occasionally smoke cigarettes and sip beer or wine. Afterwards, she claimed to not remember {{the contents of the}} session, and she would often read the transcript or ask what Seth had said.|$|E

60|$|This however {{was more}} than she could believe herself; and to be {{composed}} at such a moment was not only {{beyond the reach of}} Marianne, it was beyond her wish. She <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> agony of impatience which affected every feature.|$|R
