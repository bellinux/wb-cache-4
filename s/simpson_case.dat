25|$|Discussion of {{the racial}} {{elements}} of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and some commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined to be suspicious of the credibility and fairness of {{the police and the}} courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African Americans in the city, which was emphasized in the Rodney King case. After the civil trial verdict against Simpson, most whites surveyed said they believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated. An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The <b>Simpson</b> <b>case</b> continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that most black people now think O.J. was guilty.|$|E

2500|$|In the O. J. Simpson murder case, Dershowitz {{acted as}} an appellate adviser to O. J. Simpson's defense team during the trial, and later {{wrote a book}} about it, Reasonable Doubts: The Criminal Justice System and the O. J. <b>Simpson</b> <b>Case</b> (1996). He wrote: [...] "the <b>Simpson</b> <b>case</b> will not be remembered in the next century. It will not rank as one of the trials of the century. It will not rank with the Nuremberg trials, the Rosenberg trial, Sacco and Vanzetti. It is on par with Leopold and Loeb and the Lindbergh case, all {{involving}} celebrities. It is also not {{one of the most important}} cases of my own career. I would rank it somewhere in the middle in terms of interest and importance." [...] The case has been described as the most publicized criminal trial in American history.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trial was}} {{commonly}} {{compared to the}} O. J. Simpson murder case, both for its widespread media attention and initial shock at the not-guilty verdict. At {{the start of the}} trial, dozens of people raced to the Orange County Courthouse, hoping to secure one of 50 seats open to the public at the murder trial. Because the case received such thorough media attention in Orlando, jurors were brought in from Pinellas County, Florida, and sequestered for the entire trial. The case became a [...] "macabre tourist attraction", as people camped outside for seats in the courtroom, where scuffles also broke out among those wanting seats inside. The New York Post described the trial as going [...] "from being a newsworthy case to one of the biggest ratings draws in recent memory", and Time magazine dubbed it [...] "the social media trial of the century". Cable news channels and network news programs became intent upon covering the case as extensively as they could. Scot Safon, executive vice president of HLN, said it was [...] "not about policy" [...] but rather the [...] "very, very strong human dimension" [...] of the case that drove the network to cover it. The audience for HLN's Nancy Grace rose more than 150 percent, and other news channels deciding to focus on the trial saw their ratings double and triple. HLN achieved its most watched hour in network history (4.575 million) and peaked at 5.205 million when the verdict was read. According to The Christian Post, the O. J. <b>Simpson</b> <b>case</b> had a 91 percent television viewing audience, with 142 million people listening by radio and watching television as the verdict was delivered. [...] "The <b>Simpson</b> <b>case</b> was the longest trial ever held in California, costing more than $20million to fight and defend, running up 50,000 pages of trial transcript in the process." [...] The Casey Anthony trial was expected to [...] "far exceed" [...] these numbers.|$|E

2500|$|Authors Donald Freed and Raymond Briggs {{claimed in}} Killing Time (1996), their {{book about the}} <b>Simpson</b> <b>case,</b> that an unnamed source told them that while Nigg had lived in Colorado, {{he was known to}} law {{enforcement}} there to be [...] "involved in the narcotics culture" [...] in Aspen (where another branch of Mezzaluna is located) and Denver. According to journalist Joseph Bosco, who had a reserved seat at the entire trial, Nigg [...] "lived beyond his apparent means", driving a Mercedes and living in a luxury condominium while ostensibly deriving most of his income from waiting tables and occasional low-level acting jobs. Freed and Briggs, among others, have also observed that the circumstances of the killing seem to suggest the assailants' true intent was to kill Nigg rather than rob him. Moreover, Nigg and Goldman were not the only Mezzaluna waiters who had fallen victim to foul play around that time: two others were missing, and a third had his car destroyed by fire in Corona del Mar during 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Explanations other than, or emphasizing, the prosecution's lack of {{forensic}} evidence were {{given for the}} jury's decision. A number of media commentators reasoned that the prosecution overcharged the case by tagging on the death penalty, concluding that people in good conscience could not sentence Anthony to death based on the circumstantial evidence presented. The CSI effect was also extensively argued—that society now lives [...] "in a 'CSI age' where everyone expects fingerprints and DNA, and we are sending a message that old-fashioned circumstantial evidence is not sufficient". Likewise, commentators such as O. J. <b>Simpson</b> <b>case</b> prosecutor Marcia Clark believe that the jury interpreted [...] "reasonable doubt" [...] too narrowly. Clark said instruction on reasonable doubt is [...] "the hardest, most elusive" [...] instruction of all. [...] "And I think it's where even the most fair-minded jurors can get derailed", she said, opining the confusion between reasonable doubt and a reason to doubt. [...] "In Scotland, they have three verdicts: guilty, not guilty, and not proven. It's one way of showing {{that even if the}} jury didn't believe the evidence amounted to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it didn't find the defendant innocent either. There's a difference." ...|$|E
