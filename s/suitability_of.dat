5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do {{for about an hour}} after sunset. This may be in order to mate, or they may be influenced by the <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E

5|$|Although {{plans for}} further heavy bomber attacks on Tirpitz were {{developed}} throughout 1942, none took place. One {{of the options}} considered was to stage the bombers through a base in the northern Soviet Union, but this was judged impractical as little was known about the <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> Soviet airfields for heavy bombers at the time. Two squadrons of RAF Coastal Command Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers operated from Vaenga in northern Russia during mid-September 1942 to counter Tirpitz or any other German warships which attempted to attack Allied convoys, but these aircraft did not {{make contact with the}} enemy.|$|E
5|$|Brunner {{retired in}} 1869 at the {{relatively}} young age of 46. He remained {{employed by the}} Nelson Provincial Council as a consultant surveyor and was also head of the Nelson Survey Department. His administration skills were {{not up to the}} latter role and many of the surveys produced under his supervision were of poor quality. He also continued to seek private work and contributed to a report on the <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> the Buller region for settlement and this was published in early 1873. On his retirement in 1869 he had retained his offices of sheriff, returning officer and registration officer but was relieved of these in 1872 in cost-cutting measures by the Nelson Provincial Council. This did not meet with the approval of locals.|$|E
5|$|During {{the coming}} decades, however, the <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> the tower {{for the work}} of the {{department}} came into question. The condition of the roof remained problematic, and steel girders had to be added to support the main timbers. Increasing traffic levels around the tower led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting the operation of the delicate instruments, and worsened after the opening of Lambeth Bridge in 1932. Some of the department's work was transferred to their Bushy House facility in Teddington in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished the tower altogether.|$|E

5|$|On 15 October 1964, the Tri-partite Evaluation Squadron (TES) {{was formed}} at RAF West Raynham, staffed by a diverse mix of {{military}} test pilots from Britain, the United States and West Germany. The personnel comprising the squadron were highly experienced pilots; prior to flying the Kestrel, each received a week's ground training at Bristol's in-house facility and a week's ground instruction at Dunsford {{prior to a}} three-hour flight conversion instructed by Bill Bedford. The purpose of the squadron was to evaluate the <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> V/STOL aircraft for field operations, compare competing styles and methods of taking off/landing, develop normal flight operating procedures, perform instrument flight assessments, conduct night flight operations, and explore jet-borne maneuvering throughout the Kestrel's flight envelope.|$|E

5|$|The <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> {{the prison}} was finally {{brought to a}} head at the 1821 assizes in York, when an {{official}} complaint was made and an investigation begun. The decision was taken to purchase Clifford's Tower and the Waud house, {{with the aim of}} demolishing them both to make room for a new, more modern prison. Sydney Smith, the famous wit, writer and vicar of Foston-le-Clay, successfully led a campaign to save Clifford's Tower, emphasising the historic importance of the location for the surrounding city. An alternative proposal, put forward by architect Robert Wallace, would have seen the conversion of Clifford's Tower back into a habitable building to form the hub of a radial prison design, but this was turned down.|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and {{butterfly}} larvae to receive honeydew. Workers forage and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day, but this depends on the <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few species, a nest will not {{be placed in a}} shaded area; this is so it can warm up during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise.|$|E
5|$|At night, a carnivorous, shape-shifting alien named Kator {{lands in}} the woods of rural England. The vanguard of an {{invasion}} force, his mission is to evaluate the <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> humans {{as a source of}} food for his species. Stumbling across Anderson and Sandy, a couple having a tryst in their parked car, he kills both and assumes the appearance of Anderson. The next morning, he encounters Jessica-Ann and Josephine, a lesbian couple who live in a nearby manor house. Although Jessica owns the property, having inherited it from her Canadian parents, the dominant of the pair is Jo, who is unusually possessive of Jessica and deeply suspicious of men. Simon, Jessica's boyfriend, has mysteriously disappeared. The women are vegetarians and live in seclusion with only a few chickens and a pet parrot, Wally, for company.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} were to identify land characteristics of agroforestry system that influencing its benefit value, and to compile criteria of site specific. Location {{were identified by}} the Landsat 7 ETM+ that designed in the land use utilization type: rubber agroforestry is identified by cyan old (RGB pixel 143, 37; 173, 04; 96, 03) and palm oil agroforestry is identified by varying bright green-green (red-green-blue pixel 33 - 145; 142 - 253; 46 - 139). In each the land use utilization type done by measurement of land characteristics, cost the inputs, and price the benefits. The maximum likelihood classification system is used for classification; the benefit values were calculated by benefit-cost ratio; the <b>suitability</b> criteria <b>of</b> site specific were compiled by cluster analysis. The economic <b>suitability</b> criteria <b>of</b> rubber are: I (4, 18 - 3, 94); II (3, 94 - 3, 15); III (3, 15 - 2, 73); IV (2, 73 - 2, 31), the economic <b>suitability</b> criteria <b>of</b> palm oil are: I (3, 30 - 2, 72); II (2, 72 - 2, 07); III (2, 07 - 1, 38); IV (1, 38 - 1, 18), and would be base saturation, exchangeable Ca, and Mg.

5|$|From {{the mid-19th}} century onwards, changes in {{military}} technology repeatedly challenged the value and composition of Britain's coastal defences. The introduction of shell guns and steam ships created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast, and fears grew of a conflict in the early 1850s. Southsea Castle and St Mawes were extended with new gun batteries, Pendennis was reequipped with heavier guns and Hurst was extensively redeveloped. There were discussions about rearming Calshot, but these were rejected, {{in part due to}} concerns about the <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> the 16th-century walls in modern warfare. The Crimean War sparked a fresh invasion scare and in 1855 the south coast of England was refortified. New guns were installed at St Catherine's and Yarmouth in 1855. The remains of the West Blockhouse were destroyed by a new fortification, the West Blockhouse Fort, designed to deal with the French threat.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, flies have chemoreceptors that detect {{smell and}} taste, and mechanoreceptors that respond to touch. The third {{segments}} of the antennae and the maxillary palps bear the main olfactory receptors, while the gustatory receptors are in the labium, pharynx, feet, wing margins and female genitalia, enabling flies to taste their food by walking on it. The taste receptors in females {{at the tip of}} the abdomen receive information on the <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> a site for ovipositing. Flies that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts, and many blood-sucking flies can detect the raised concentration of carbon dioxide that occurs near large animals. Some tachinid flies (Ormiinae) which are parasitoids of bush crickets, have sound receptors to help them locate their singing hosts.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{concerns}} {{had been}} growing about the unsympathetic treatment of historic military buildings by the War Office; for its part, the War Office was concerned that it might find itself financially supporting these properties from its own budget. Yarmouth Castle was passed to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests in 1901, with parts of it were leased to the neighbouring hotel. The War Office concluded that Walmer and Deal had no remaining military value and agreed to transfer the castles to the Office of Works in 1904, who opened both former fortifications to visitors. Portland Castle was placed onto what {{was known as the}} Schedule C list, which meant that the Army would continue to use and manage the historic property, but would receive advice on the <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> repairs from the Office of Works.|$|E

Oviposition tests using 3 -choice arenas with quaking aspen, paper birch, and balsam poplar showed no strong host preferences. Factors affecting patterns of Papilio host use in the Great Lakes region are discussed...|$|R
