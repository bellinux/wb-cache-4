40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{relative}} attachment {{level data}} (RAL) {{selected by the}} Option- 4 algorithm (O- 4), Modified Option- 4 algorithm (MO- 4), Option- 3 method (O- 3) and Double Pass method (DP) from a common dataset and to determine the most efficient method in eliminating outliers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single clinician recorded full mouth RAL with the Florida Disc Probe on four occasions over 6 months in 16 subjects (mean age 48. 1 years) with untreated moderate Chronic Adult Periodontitis (mean Probeable Crevice Depth 2. 9 mm). RESULTS: 2312 <b>sites</b> were available <b>for</b> analysis. Within-visit correlation coefficients for the two selected RAL measurements were 0. 98 (P or= 0. 92 (P or= 99. 9 % <b>sites</b> <b>for</b> O- 4, >or= 99. 9 % <b>sites</b> <b>for</b> MO- 4, >or= 99. 3 % <b>sites</b> <b>for</b> O- 3 and >or= 85. 6 % <b>sites</b> <b>for</b> DP. Remeasurement (in addition to two passes) was required over the study period at 16. 6 % <b>sites</b> <b>for</b> O- 4, 13. 2 % <b>sites</b> <b>for</b> MO- 4 and 13. 0 % <b>sites</b> <b>for</b> O- 3 : DP, by definition, required no additional measurements. The mean site-specific variances at all visits were <or= 0. 1 mm(2) for O- 4, MO- 4 and O- 3 and <or= 0. 44 mm(2) for DP. CONCLUSIONS: The Option- 4 algorithm {{was found to be}} the most effective outlier reduction protocol currently available, producing the most reproducible data.

5|$|Of {{the many}} bird species {{found in the}} Mendips, the {{peregrine}} falcon (Falco peregrinus), which has gradually recolonised the area since the 1980s, is particularly significant. It breeds on sea and inland cliffs and {{on the faces of}} active and disused quarries. The upland heaths of the west Mendips have recently increased in ornithological importance due to colonisation by the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata), which can be found at Black Down and Crook Peak. In Britain, this species is usually associated with lowland heath. The woodlands at Stock Hill are a breeding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> nightjars (Caprimulgus europaeus) and long-eared owls (Asio otus). The Waldegrave Pool, part of Priddy Mineries, is an important <b>site</b> <b>for</b> dragonflies, including downy emerald (Cordulia aenea) and four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata). Waldegrave Pool is the only Mendip breeding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> downy emerald dragonflies.
