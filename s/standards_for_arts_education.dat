The literature indicated that the federally supported Tech Prep and School-to-Work reform movements were not acquainted with DBAE reform initiative which were supported by the Getty <b>Education</b> Institute <b>for</b> the <b>Arts</b> through the work of Regional Institutes. Therefore, they had no ideas about the possible worth of <b>art</b> as an <b>education</b> core component. Also, DBAE was not acquainted with Tech Prep and School-to-Work and therefore had established no common terminology to communicate the power of what they do in a manner which was relevant to that audience. The DBAE Regional Institutes provided individuals to assist in the development and validation of the study tools, and to participate in the pilot study. The Regional Institutes also identified the 10 Discipline-Based <b>Art</b> <b>Education</b> experts who composed the national Delphi panel for the study.

These three components have the potential to connect classroom learning to the outside world of art. Forming this connection is necessary in fully understanding art. Logistic and financial issues are the two main factors currently preventing these opportunities from being available. Hillsboro School District students and their families show a financial disadvantage with 40 % of students receiving free and reduced school lunch.

Case studies were used to determine the impact of art-rich programmes on the education of children and young people, and the results were analysed using numerical and qualitative triangulation, and cross-checked with 170 empirical case studies. Using extensive quantitative and qualitative methods to draw conclusions about the role of arts-rich programmes, Bamford developed internationally comparable <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> quality <b>arts</b> <b>education,</b> and identified a number of concrete educational, cultural and social benefits of <b>arts</b> <b>education.</b> This research has become a reference point for national policies in <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> including The Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Australia, Czech Republic, Korea, France, Germany and South Africa; was featured in the Dossier l’Education Artistique (no. 42, 2006), and Cuadernos de Pedagogía (November 2005).

LSS joined the Brooklyn non-profit and worked with future tenants and community members to redesign the public spaces, then collaborated with local artists to work in fabricating these elements. The project’s success inspired the later formation of HSC to work with communities in need on design-build projects.In 2001, LSS relocated to Hester Street in New York City’s Chinatown. Across the street was the public Sun Yat Sen middle school, or M.S. 131. Architects from LSS approached the school to work with students to design and build a new garden in the neglected front yards. Over two years, an architectural education program was linked to M.S. 131’s core curriculum. The program, later named Ground Up, introduced students to architectural concepts through design exercises and workshops culminating in a campus or community improvement project.

Currently the position is endorsed in the Housewright Declaration (Madsen, 2000), a summation of agreements made during the Housewright Symposium on the Future of Music Education. Although music teachers believe in the value and benefit of world music instruction, they often are uncertain {{as to how to}} provide that instruction effectively (Moore, 1993; Norman, 1994; Young, 1996). This uncertainty remains an ongoing concern. What constitutes effective world music instruction? One component involves providing music experiences that are likely to increase students preferences for the music style studied, as this is a desired long-term outcome for music instruction. Reimer (1965) indicated that teaching methods, among other considerations, should be examined to determine how and to what extent the teaching-learning process affects learners in terms of achievement and levels of music preference.

While other signs and symbol systems such as text and numbers have dominated, and other arts forms such as music and dance are able to express and reveal the pulse of human existence, it {{is the emergence of}} new visual technologies and new multimodal forms of the visual that see us expressing and communicating, as never before, {{in a wide variety of}} visual forms and materials- including multi-media, web, video, photography and film- along with expressions and communications through design objects and the more traditional forms of art and crafts. Many of these forms of visual expression and presentation are penetrating deeply into everyday work and life.

40|$|Project (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Education, 2008 Although aural {{learning}} and improvisation of music have been fundamental components of music learning theories {{for at least}} two hundred years, published resources for beginning instrumentalists usually take a notation-first approach. An analysis of popular beginning band method books published {{in the last six years}} further reveals an emphasis on the teaching of techniques necessary to play music in the Western classical tradition, an emphasis which might influence instrumental teachers' values and teaching approaches. An alternative approach in beginning instrumental music instruction emphasizes improvisation and the development of music listening and speaking vocabularies prior to the development of music literacy. Jazz offers an ideal medium for this exploration, as improvisation is integral to this art form, and it is a genre outside of the Western Classical tradition. 	The call to incorporate improvisation and jazz into the beginning instrumental curriculum will necessitate the revision of current curricula, the adoption of new learning goals, and the development of additional teaching strategies. This project aims to help fill this void and to make improvisation and jazz available to all instrumentalists through the creation of a jazz-based beginning band improvisation curriculum unit for grades 5 through 8. The unit that is the content of Chapter Four of the project meets the National <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>Education</b> improvisation content standard and can be taught within the typical time constraints of beginning instrumental instruction in a school setting...|$|E
