The operation soon ran into problems: early on there were difficulties with the custom-made lifting equipment; divers on the project belonging to the Royal Engineers had to be pulled because of {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War; and the method of lifting the hull had to be considerably altered as late as June. After the frame was properly attached to the hull it was slowly jacked up on four legs straddling the wreck site to pull the ship off the seabed. The massive crane of the barge Tog Mor was then used to lift the frame and hull on to the specially designed cradle which was padded with water-filled bags. On the morning of [...] 1982, the final lift of the entire package of cradle, hull and lifting frame began. At 9:03 the first timbers of the Mary Rose broke the surface {{in the presence of the}} team, Prince Charles and curious spectators on boats circling the site. A second set of bags under the hull was inflated with air to cushion the waterlogged wood and finally the whole package was transferred to the barge that would take the hull ashore. Though eventually successful, the operation was close to floundering on two occasions; first when one of the <b>supporting</b> <b>legs</b> of the lifting frame was bent and had to be removed and later when a corner of the frame, with [...] "an unforgettable crunch", slipped more than a metre (3feet) and came close to crushing part of the hull.|$|E

Each of the three elevator shafts is lined with glass, allowing for views of the city as the glass-windowed elevators make their way through the Tower. The stairwell was originally located in one of these angles (the one facing north), but was moved into the central hollow of the Tower; the Tower's new fifth and sixth elevators were placed in the hexagonal angle that once contained the stairwell.

The hexagonal shape can be seen between the two areas; however, below the main deck, three large <b>supporting</b> <b>legs</b> give the tower the appearance of a large tripod.|$|E
6000|$|We {{passed an}} hour on the piazza, after eating our supper, and there being a {{collection}} of men assembled there, inhabitants of the hamlet, we had an opportunity to get into communication with them. My uncle sold a watch, and I played on the hurdy-gurdy, by way of making myself popular. After this beginning, the discourse turned on the engrossing subject of the day, anti-rentism. The principal speaker was a young man about six-and-twenty, of a sort of shabby-genteel air and appearance, whom I soon discovered to be the attorney of the neighborhood. His name was Hubbard, while that of the other principal speaker was Hall. The last was a mechanic, as I ascertained, and was a plain-looking working-man of middle age. Each of these persons seated himself on a common [...] "kitchen chair," [...] leaning back {{against the side of the}} house, and, of course, resting on the two hind-legs of the rickety support, while he placed his own feet on the rounds in front. The attitudes were neither graceful nor picturesque, but they were so entirely common as to excite no surprise. As for Hall, he appeared perfectly contented with his situation, after fidgeting a little to get the two <b>supporting</b> <b>legs</b> of his chair just where he wanted them; but Hubbard's eye was restless, uneasy, and even menacing, for more than a minute. He drew a knife from his pocket--a small, neat penknife only, it is true--gazed a little wildly about him, and just as I thought he intended to abandon his nicely poised chair, and to make an assault on one of the pillars that upheld the roof of the piazza, the innkeeper advanced, holding in his hand several narrow slips of pine board, one of which he offered at once to 'Squire Hubbard. This relieved the attorney, who took the wood, and was soon deeply plunged in, to me, the unknown delights of whittling. I cannot explain the mysterious pleasure that so many find in whittling, though the prevalence of the custom is so well known. But I cannot explain the pleasure so many find in chewing tobacco, or in smoking. The precaution of the landlord was far from being unnecessary, and appeared to be taken in good part by all to whom he offered [...] "whittling-pieces," [...] some six or eight in the whole. The state of the piazza, indeed, proved that the precaution was absolutely indispensable, if he did not wish to see the house come tumbling down about his head. In order that those who have never seen such things may understand their use, I will go a little out of the way to explain.|$|E

50|$|Similar {{to modern}} spirit levels, the Chorobates {{consisted}} of a beam of wood 6 m in length held by 2 <b>supporting</b> <b>legs</b> and equipped with 2 plumb lines at each end. The legs were joined to the beam by two diagonal rods with carved notches. If the notches corresponding to the plumb lines matched on both sides, it showed that the beam was level. On top of the beam, a groove or channel was carved. If the condition was too windy for the plumb bobs to work effectively, the surveyor could pour water into the groove and measure the plane by checking the water level.|$|E

For each pair of wash boxes there is one primary scrubber that rests on a concrete pedestal and stands 48 ft tall (11.5 ft diameter). The output from the two primary scrubbers goes into the single secondary scrubber of welded steel construction (12 ft diameter, 68 ft tall).

50|$|Just {{prior to}} the swing phase, the athlete should land on the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> with the knee {{slightly}} flexed so as to absorb some of the impact and thereby stabilize the body for more effective motion of the kicking leg. The best position of the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> {{has been found to}} be 5 to 10 cm to the side of the ball (left of the ball for a right-footed kicker, right of the ball for a left-footed kicker). Skilled athletes have a tendency toward a closer ball-to-support leg side position. For forward to back positioning, there is variability based on the desired action of the ball. Placing the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> further behind the ball will produce a greater upward direction whereas placing the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> closer to the ball will produce greater forward propulsion. Ball flight trajectory is dictated by the supporting foot’s position. The support foot should be positioned so as to be parallel to the intended direction of the ball. Other important body positioning to be aware of is to bend the upper body slightly forward over the ball.|$|R

Her rearmost set of twin torpedo tubes was removed, the three 102 mm guns on the quarterdeck were moved forward and a 76.2 mm [...] "Lender" [...] anti-aircraft gun was mounted at the very rear of the quarterdeck, which seriously obscured the arc of fire of the rear 102 mm gun. The three remaining twin sets of torpedo tubes were exchanged for triple launchers and repositioned, a net increase of one torpedo tube. The bridge structure was enlarged and the deckhouse immediately aft of the fourth funnel was removed and a new, larger deckhouse was added about 9 m aft of the fourth funnel. The masts were repositioned and reinforced with <b>supporting</b> <b>legs</b> while the forward funnel was heightened by 2 m.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{function}} of torques exerted by the joints of the lower trunk during maximal velocity sprinting. Eight male track and field athletes volunteered, and sprinted 60 m from a standing start position. The ground reaction force of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> was determined using a force platform (1000 Hz), which was placed at the 50 -m mark from the start position. Simultaneously, 3 D coordinates were recorded with a motion analysis system (250 Hz) using 20 cameras (MX-T 20). The joint torques were calculated using inverse dynamics. The contribution of joint torques to the right and left hip joint forces, and the torso joint force, was calculated by a method that simultaneously solves equations of motion for each segment and equations of constraint conditions for adjacent segments connected by a joint. The main results were as follows: (1) During the terminal support phase (80 - 100 % normalized time), the angular velocity of anterior rotation of the pelvis decreased and participants in whom this angular velocity decrease was diminished ran faster (p< 0. 10). (2) During terminal support, the hip joint adduction torque of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint rotated the pelvis forward. The moment of the right and left hip joint forces rotated the pelvis backward. (3) During terminal support, the hip joint force of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> was generated by its hip joint flexion and adduction torque, the hip joint extension torque of the recovery leg, and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint. In contrast, the hip joint force of the recovery leg was generated by the hip joint flexion and adduction torque of the <b>support</b> <b>leg,</b> and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint. (4) During terminal support, the hip joint flexion torque exerted by the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> rotated the pelvis backward. The hip joint adduction torque of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint rotated the pelvis forward. Previous studies showed that the hip flexion torque drives the leg forward from the hip joint extension position. This present study has clarified that the hip joint adduction torque of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint nullify backward rotation of the pelvis due to the hip joint flexion torque exerted by the <b>support</b> <b>leg...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{studies on}} the insect water strider showed that the insect heavily relies on surface tension force to stay afloat. Inspired by this insect, water strider robots have been {{developed}} using the same locomotive principles as the insect. This paper focuses on numerically modeling the <b>supporting</b> <b>legs</b> of the insect and the robots. The rigid-leg model {{as well as the}} compliantleg model is developed using numerical approaches, under an assumption made on the water surface breaking condition. The effect of different leg material and geometry are discussed. It is shown through simulations that four 7 cm-long Teflon R ○ coated compliant <b>supporting</b> <b>legs</b> with optimized shapes can lift up to 4. 3 grams (0. 15 g/cm), while an actual prototype carried 3. 7 grams. Another prototype using twelve of these legs successfully lifted 9. 3 grams. Experiments show that the analyses capture the important features of the <b>supporting</b> <b>legs.</b> The design rules proposed in this paper will be useful in understanding the insect statics and also the robotic water strider supporting leg design. This study will allow a heavier robot to be used for education, entertainment or environment monitoring purposes. I...|$|E

In existing dynamic models of this mechanism, derived using either the Lagrange formulation or the Newton-Euler method, the masses of the <b>supporting</b> <b>legs</b> often have been ignored and, their inertia, invariably, assumed negligible. The modeling scheme developed in this paper is based on Kane's dynamical equations and takes account of both the platform's and the <b>supporting</b> <b>legs</b> ' masses and inertia. A computer program is reported which implements this scheme to determine the actuator forces needed to produce desired platform trajectories. Pinally, the outputs of this program are presented, first to highlight the effects of supporting leg dynamics, and second, to show the even greater influence of drive system inertia on the overall dynamics of the mechanism...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{investigate}} the influence of the extension of the <b>support</b> <b>leg's</b> joints during the repositioning phase of an ice dancing push-off on performance. The second objective was to identify the relevant kinematic parameters of this skating movement. Seven international level skaters were filmed in the sagittal plane while performing two starting push-offs. Extending the <b>support</b> <b>leg's</b> lower limb joints completed the first push-off. In the second push-off, subjects kept these joints flexed in a static position. Results pointed out that the extension of the <b>support</b> <b>leg's</b> joints significantly increased the push-off length and velocity by 9 % and 6 % respectively. The temporal structure of the push-off was not altered by the two testing conditions. Regarding the angular parameters of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> during the repositioning phase, the knee joint amplitude, average knee angular velocity and peak thigh velocity were positively related to the push-off velocity. Considering the above results, coaches should now focus on the development of the knee extensors' power during off-ice training sessions. This would enhance the velocity of the skater during the repositioning phase solely from the action of one lower limb...|$|R

50|$|The classic speedskating {{technique}} is an alternating cycle of inside-edge pushes and outer-edge glides. The cycle starts as the skater is gliding on one (let us suppose the right) leg with a bent knee. He then straightens (extends) the right knee and hip while leaning to the left. The {{direction of the}} push is therefore outwards (rightwards) {{from the center of}} mass. When the pushing leg reaches full extension he sets down the left (now <b>support)</b> <b>leg</b> and glides on it while picking up the right leg and bringing it back behind and underneath him (recovery) ready to be placed on the ground (set down) and become the new <b>support</b> <b>leg.</b> Once the pushing leg has been recovered, the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> pushes out in the other direction and the cycle repeats. Note that the pushes are always in a lateral direction: the left leg pushes exclusively leftwards, and the right leg exclusively rightwards.|$|R
