25|$|Manchukuo {{developed}} an efficient public education system. The government established many schools and technical colleges, 12,000 primary schools in Manchukuo, 200 middle schools, 140 normal schools (for preparing teachers), and 50 technical and professional schools. In total the system had 600,000 {{children and young}} pupils and 25,000 teachers.

Ciolino spoke to William Taylor, who, in December 1998, recanted his original statements, saying that Chicago police had [...] "threatened, harassed and intimidated" [...] him into accusing Porter.

2500|$|Reformist leaders envisioned in 1978 that intellectuals {{would play}} {{a leading role in}} guiding the country through reforms, but this did not happen as planned. Despite the opening of new {{universities}} and increased enrollment, the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased market demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment. The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities. Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept <b>students</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> them by the state, and many high-paying jobs were offered on the basis of nepotism and favoritism. Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in their area of jurisdiction. Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues. Small study groups, such as the [...] "Democracy Salon" [...] and the [...] "Lawn Salon" [...] (Caodi Shalong), began appearing on Beijing university campuses. These organizations motivated the students to get involved politically.|$|E
