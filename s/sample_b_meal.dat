40|$|Yellow-seeded Brassica (B.) juncea {{is a novel}} canola species. Therefore, its meal {{co-product}} requires feed {{quality evaluation}} and comparison to conventional, dark-seeded <b>B.</b> napus canola <b>meal</b> for pigs. The <b>B.</b> juncea canola <b>meal</b> contains less fibre than <b>B.</b> napus canola <b>meal</b> (190 vs. 260 g NDF/kg, as is), but also less lysine (20. 3 vs. 22. 1 g/kg). Nutrient digestibility and fermentibility of B. juncea and <b>B.</b> napus canola <b>meal</b> were assessed in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Six ileal-cannulated pigs (47 kg BW) were fed six diets in a 6 × 6 Latin square: basal diet (460 g wheat/kg and corn starch), 4 diets with 460 g wheat/kg and either B. juncea or <b>B.</b> napus canola <b>meal</b> at 250 or 500 g/kg replacing corn starch, sugar and canola oil, and an N-free diet based on corn starch. The <b>B.</b> juncea canola <b>meal</b> had greater (P < 0. 05) CATTD of gross energy than <b>B.</b> napus canola <b>meal</b> (0. 70 vs. 0. 63) most likely due to its lower fibre content. Ileal total VFA concentration was lower (P < 0. 001) in pigs fed B. juncea than <b>B.</b> napus canola <b>meal</b> diets (15. 2 vs. 20. 8 μmol/g of wet digesta). In pigs fed <b>B.</b> juncea canola <b>meal</b> instead of <b>B.</b> napus canola <b>meal</b> diets, the molar ratio was greater (P < 0. 01) for digesta propionate and faecal acetate, but lower (P < 0. 05) for digesta and faecal butyrate. Canola meal species {{did not affect the}} CAID of gross energy, CSID of amino acid and faecal VFA content. The digestible energy (DE) value was greater (P < 0. 01; 12. 1 vs. 10. 9 MJ/kg, standardised to 100 g/kg moisture) for B. juncea than <b>B.</b> napus canola <b>meal.</b> Increasing dietary inclusion of canola meal up to 500 g/kg reduced (P < 0. 01) diet digestibility of gross energy but not amino acids and decreased (P < 0. 05) intestinal fermentability of B. napus but not B. juncea. In conclusion, <b>B.</b> juncea canola <b>meal</b> had greater fermentability and ATTD of gross energy than <b>B.</b> napus canola <b>meal,</b> but digestibility of amino acids did not differ. Increasing dietary inclusion of canola meal up to 500 g/kg reduced digestibility of gross energy but not digestibility of AA. Fermentability of <b>B.</b> napus canola <b>meal</b> but not <b>B.</b> juncea canola <b>meal</b> decreased in the pig intestine with increased dietary inclusion. Hence, yellow-seeded <b>B.</b> juncea canola <b>meal</b> had a greater DE value, similar amino acid digestibility as conventional dark-seed <b>B.</b> napus canola <b>meal</b> and may limit protein fermentation in the pig intestine...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} to evaluate the nutritional value of meal derived from low glucosinolate cultivars of mustard (Brassica juncea) in comparison to samples of canola meal (Brassica napus, Brassica rapa). Samples of Brassica seed (four B. juncea, one B. napus, and one B. rapa) were processed using laboratory procedures to produce oil-extracted meals, which were examined for composition (DM basis), and nutritional value for broiler chickens as judged by nutrient retention (AMEn, ileal protein digestibility) and performance. <b>Meals</b> derived from <b>B.</b> juncea contained more CP and less total dietary fiber (TDF) on a dry basis than either B. napus or B. rapa, 45. 9 vs 44. 6 and 43. 1 % CP and 27. 22 vs 29. 47 and 29. 67 % TDF, respectively. Acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) levels for B. juncea and <b>B.</b> rapa <b>meals</b> were similar to each other, but {{lower than those of}} B. napus, 12. 79 and 13. 20 vs 20. 6 % ADF, and 21. 15 and 19. 58 vs 29. 47 % NDF, respectively. Brassica juncea meals contained more glucosinolates than B. napus and B. rapa, 34. 3 vs 21. 8 and 25. 5 mmol/g total glucosinolates, respectively. Brassica juncea meals were equal or superior to B. napus and <b>B.</b> rapa <b>meals</b> for AMEn and apparent ileal protein digestibility. Similarly, broilers fed <b>B.</b> juncea <b>meals</b> grew as quickly and converted feed to BW gain as efficiently to 21 d of age as those birds fed B. napus and <b>B.</b> rapa <b>meals.</b> Feeding <b>meal</b> from <b>B.</b> rapa reduced growth rate and gain to feed ratio.

Gastric emptying and transit through the left upper quadrant (proximal) and right lower quadrant (distal) small bowel regions and colon were assessed scintigraphically. Transit was compared with and without a second Indium- 111 liquid/solid DTPA labelled 2. 28 MJ <b>meal</b> (<b>B)</b> given three hours after the first meal.  Results—Gastric emptying of meal A was slower than <b>meal</b> <b>B</b> (the time for 50 % of the activity to leave the stomach (T 50) being 113 (11) minutes versus 48 (3) minutes respectively, p< 0. 01, n= 11).

Transit of meal A through the distal small bowel was much slower (T 50 more than 390 minutes versus 176 (29) minutes for <b>meal</b> <b>B,</b> p< 0. 01), resulting in <b>meal</b> <b>B</b> overtaking <b>meal</b> A and entering the colon earlier.

The broadening of the diffraction peak indicates the small crystallite size of the deposited ZnSe. Moreover, the ZnO (002) peak exhibits a small shift (approximately 0.2 °) toward the smaller angle side, suggesting that the lattice of the ZnO cores suffers a tensile strain. This {{can be attributed to}} the growth of the ZnSe shells outside the ZnO cores since ZnSe has a much larger lattice constant than ZnO [9].

Furthermore, two additional peaks are observed at approximately 45.3 ° and 53.5 °, respectively, which can be assigned to the (220) and (311) diffractions of cubic zinc blende ZnSe. The lattice constant of ZnSe is determined to be a[*]=[*] 0.568 nm. Contrast to <b>sample</b> <b>B,</b> more diffraction peaks are observed for sample C with the ZnSe (111) diffraction exhibiting a higher intensity and a narrower FWHM, indicating that sample C has a better crystallinity than <b>sample</b> <b>B.</b> The above XRD results suggest that better crystallinity of ZnO cores and ZnSe shells could be obtained either by RT deposition of ZnSe followed by post-deposition annealing or merely by depositing ZnSe at elevated temperatures.|$|R
