500|$|After {{recording}} several vocal {{tracks for}} a possible new Simon & Garfunkel album, Simon decided to adopt it as his own solo album. Garfunkel refused to learn the songs {{in the studio and}} would not give up his longstanding cannabis and cigarette habits despite Simon's requests. An official spokesperson remarked, [...] "Paul simply felt the material he wrote is so close to his own life {{that it had to be}} his own record. Art was hoping to be on the album, but I'm <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be other projects that they will work on together. They are still friends." [...] The material was later released on Simon's 1983 effort Hearts and Bones. Another rift opened between the duo when the lengthy recording of Simon's 1986 album Graceland prevented Garfunkel from working with Roy Halee on a Christmas album. In 1990, the duo was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Garfunkel thanked his partner, calling him [...] "the person who most enriched my life by putting those songs through me," [...] to which Simon responded, [...] "Arthur and I agree about almost nothing. But it's true, I have enriched his life quite a bit." [...] After three songs, the duo left without speaking. In August 1991 Simon staged his own concert in Central Park, which was released a few months later. Art Garfunkel had offered to lend his friend a hand in creating another park reunion in which Simon declined, leading the concert as a solo act.|$|E

2500|$|Romney {{argued that}} tax {{policy should be}} used to promote energy conservation. When his {{lieutenant}} governor supported a temporary suspension of the state gasoline tax to provide consumers some relief during a period of especially high gasoline prices in 2006, Romney rejected the proposal, arguing that maintaining the tax would help encourage energy conservation: “I don’t think that now is the time, and I’m not <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be the right time, for us to encourage the use of more gasoline.... I am very much in favor of people recognizing that these high gasoline prices are probably here to stay and that the appropriate action for us to take is to find ways to find fuel conservation.” ...|$|E

2500|$|At the [...] "Develop" [...] {{conference in}} July 2012, Perry {{released}} a statement that he's <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be another Earthworm Jim game. He claimed the problem was [...] "when", not [...] "if", as, while the development team members discuss the project actively, they are all busy with their separate projects and companies. A possible premise he outlined was, [...] "The thing we had {{talked about in the}} past is Jim had been in retirement...So, he's been sitting at home watching movies and eating popcorn. He's grossly overweight now. The plan was to start with him literally getting off the sofa, and it's a disaster because he just hasn't done anything since. But he's got to get back into action again." [...] While details regarding just how much Jim being out of shape would affect game design are still up in the air, Perry mentioned being pretty certain that the game would be played in 2D.|$|E
