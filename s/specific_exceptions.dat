5|$|This Act made null {{and void}} (with certain <b>specific</b> <b>exceptions)</b> the Marian act of 1554 that had {{repealed}} all Henry VIII's legislation from 1529 onwards, which had denied {{the authority of the}} See of Rome and also confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Supreme Governor was a suitably equivocal title that made Elizabeth head of the Church without ever saying she was. This was important for two reasons: (1) it satisfied those who felt that a woman could not rule the church, and (2) it acted in a conciliatory way toward English Roman Catholics. For the clergy, Elizabeth's changes were more wholesale than those of her half-brother, Edward, had been. All but one (Anthony Kitchin) of the bishops lost their posts, a hundred fellows of Oxford colleges were deprived; many dignitaries resigned rather than take the oath. The bishops who were removed from the ecclesiastical bench were replaced by appointees who would agree to the reforms.|$|E
25|$|Members of Parliament are {{permitted}} to speak on any subject without fear of censure outside Parliament; the only body that can censure an MP is the House Committee of Privileges. Parliamentary immunity takes effect from the moment a member of Parliament is sworn in, and only applies when that member has the floor; it {{does not apply to}} statements made outside the House. An exception to this rule are portions of the constitution related to the social contract, such as the Articles governing citizenship, Bumiputera (Malays and indigenous people) priorities, the Malay language, etc. — all public questioning of these provisions is illegal under the 1971 amendments to the Sedition Act, which Parliament passed {{in the wake of the}} 1969 13 May race riots. Members of Parliament are also forbidden from criticising the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and judges. Parliamentary immunity and other such privileges are set out by Article 63 of the Constitution; as such, the <b>specific</b> <b>exceptions</b> to such immunity had to be included in the Constitution by amendment after the 13 May incident.|$|E
500|$|The Assemblies of God {{will not}} grant {{credentials}} to divorced and remarried persons if either partner has a former spouse living unless for <b>specific</b> <b>exceptions.</b> Exceptions include if the divorce occurred prior to an applicant's conversion or for [...] "scriptural causes" [...] {{such as a}} former spouse's marital unfaithfulness or the abandonment of a Christian by a non-Christian partner (see Pauline privilege). The Executive Presbytery has authority to issue ecclesiastical annulments in cases involving conditions that prevent [...] "the creation of a valid marriage union", such as fraud. Clergy are also barred from membership in secret societies.|$|E
50|$|A special-use permit {{occurs when}} a zoning {{regulations}} allows some <b>specific</b> <b>exception</b> to its regulations provided that a landowner receive a special-use permit from the local zoning authority.

500|$|In March 1660 the Long Parliament finally {{dissolved}} itself, {{and elections}} were {{held for the}} Convention Parliament, which sat in May. [...] This body, dominated by royalists and Presbyterians, formally proclaimed Charles II as king, and he was restored to the throne on 29 May 1660. [...] In order to minimize acts of reprisal and vengeance for acts taken during the Interregnum, the parliament passed the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, under whose terms most actions were forgiven. [...] <b>Specific</b> <b>exceptions</b> were made for those {{directly involved in the}} regicide, and after long debate, Vane was also named as an exception. [...] The act was not passed until August 1660, and Vane was arrested on 1 July 1660 on the orders of the king and imprisoned in the Tower of London. [...] The parliament, after passing the Indemnity Act, petitioned Charles to grant clemency to Vane and others, asking that his life might be spared. This petition was granted.|$|E
500|$|Justice Stanley Matthews {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the unanimous court. [...] Matthews noted that Crow Dog was indicted for murder under a statute prohibiting murder on federal land. Matthews then looked at the federal laws dealing with Indians, including a statute that applied the prohibition on murder to Indian reservations and another covering exceptions to prosecution. The first statute prohibited murder on federal land, the second statute applied the first statute to reservations, and the last had <b>specific</b> <b>exceptions</b> to prosecution. Matthews felt that this last section was the most critical one in the case, with the section stating unequivocally that federal law: [...] "shall not be construed to extend to [...] any Indian committing any offense in the Indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe" [...] (brackets in original). Matthews rejected the contention of the United States that the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie implicitly repealed the exceptions to prosecution. He stated that since the law had not been amended or changed, and since implied repeals are not favored unless the implication is necessary, to allow such a repeal would be to reverse the general policy of the United States. Matthews said that such a repeal required a [...] "clear expression of the intention of Congress," [...] which was not present in the case. In a clear evocation of the principle of tribal sovereignty, Matthews stated: ...|$|E

Adherents of Centrist Orthodoxy are thus well represented, proportionately, in the professions and in academia - and to some extent in politics. Members of Haredi communities, by contrast, will typically not undertake any post high school secular education (except for <b>specific</b> <b>exceptions</b> for livelihood purposes), and will, in general, minimize involvement with the secular.|$|E
50|$|On 26 December 1321, the King {{ordered the}} Sheriff of Gloucester to arrest Bartholomew. Shortly afterwards, the King offered safe conducts to the rebels {{who would come}} over to him, with the <b>specific</b> <b>exception</b> of Bartholomew de Badlesmere.|$|R

2500|$|Fair dealing is not {{the same}} as fair use. This has, for example, been {{interpreted}} by US courts to allow for reasonable personal use of works, e.g. media-shifting, which would not necessarily be permitted under Australia's fair dealing laws. [...] Australian copyright law does, however, have a number of additional <b>specific</b> <b>exceptions</b> which permit uses which may fall outside of both fair dealing and fair use. For example, a number of exceptions exist which permit specific uses of computer software.|$|E

2500|$|To {{illustrate}} a {{variation in the}} concept of duty to rescue, in the Canadian province of Ontario, the Occupational Health and Safety Act provides all workers with the right to refuse to perform unsafe work.

[...] When the [...] "life, health or safety of another person is at risk," [...] then specific groups, including [...] "police officers, firefighters, or employees of a hospital, clinic or other type of medical worker (including EMS)" [...] are specifically excluded from the right to refuse unsafe work.|$|E
50|$|The second <b>specific</b> <b>exception</b> {{is found}} in article 51, {{regarding}} the right to self-defence.

In 2002, after years of lobbying by the National Automobile Dealers Association, Congress passed the Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act, which prohibited mandatory predispute arbitration clauses in motor vehicle dealership franchise agreements. President George W. Bush signed it into law, the first time a <b>specific</b> <b>exception</b> to the FAA had been legislated since the Court began expanding its scope.|$|R

2500|$|Perhaps {{the first}} public {{statement}} on the matter to be both serious and strong came from Catherine II (Catherine the Great), whose liberal views were consistent with her acceptance of the Enlightenment. In her Nakaz of 1767, the empress expressed a disdain for the death penalty, considering it to be improper, adding: [...] "In the usual state of the society, death penalty is neither useful nor needed." [...] However, an explicit exception was still allowed for the case of someone who, even while convicted and incarcerated, [...] "still has the means and the might to ignite public unrest".

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the lack of {{extensibility}} of the exception type in Haskell. We propose a lightweight solution involving the use of existential types and the Typeable class only, and show how our solution allows a fully extensible hierarchy of exception types to be declared, in which a single overloaded catch operator {{can be used to}} catch either <b>specific</b> <b>exception</b> types, or exceptions belonging to any subclass in the hierarchy. We also show how to combine the existing object-oriented framework OOHaskell with our design, such that OOHaskell objects can be thrown and caught as exceptions, with full support for implicit OOHaskell subtyping in the catch operator...|$|R
