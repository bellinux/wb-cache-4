40|$|We {{classify}} geodesically complete, compact 2 -dimensional spherical polyhedra X of {{diameter and}} injectivity radius ß. If X contains a point whose link has diameter ? ß then either (i) X is the <b>spherical</b> <b>join</b> of the finite set P of points whose link has diameter ? ß with the metric graph E = fx 2 X : d(x; P) = ß= 2 g whose diameter is ? ß or (ii) X is a hemispherex, that is, X is obtained by attaching hemispheres {{to the standard}} sphere S along great circles so {{that not all of}} them pass through the same pair of opposite points in S. If all links of X have diameter ß then either (i) X is a thick spherical building of type A 3 or B 3, or (ii) X is the <b>spherical</b> <b>join</b> of a finite set with a graph E of diameter ß. In each case the injectivity radius of E is ß. 1. Introduction The diameter rigidity question considered in this paper is motivated by the rank rigidity problem for spaces of nonpositive curvature. The rank of a complete, simply connected space Y of nonpositive curvature is 2 i [...] ...|$|E

We {{will show}} that if a proper {{complete}} CAT(0) space X has a visual boundary homeomorphic to the join of two Cantor sets, and X admits a geometric group action by a group containing a subgroup isomorphic to Z 2, then its Tits boundary is the <b>spherical</b> <b>join</b> of two uncountable discrete sets.

According to Georgious Kyriakos in Cyprus Heritage, at the Cyprus Museum there are artifacts found in Vouno, such as [...] "A Composite vase of White Painted V ware. It consists of four <b>spherical</b> parts <b>joined</b> to a common neck with a pinched mouth.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} into macroscopic and microscopic behaviors of wet granular soils using the discrete element method (DEM) and the X-ray Computed Tomography (XRCT) observations. The specimens are first prepared in very loose states, with frictional spherical grains {{in the presence of}} a small amount of an interstitial liquid. Experimental oedometric tests are carried out with small glass beads, while DEM simulations implement a model of <b>spherical</b> grains <b>joined</b> by menisci. Both in experiments and in simulations, loose configurations with solid fraction as low as 0. 30 are prepared under low stress, and undergo a gradual collapse in compression, until the solid fraction of cohesionless bead packs (0. 58 to 0. 6) is obtained. In the XRCT tests, four 3 D tomography images corresponding to different typical stages of the compression curve are used to characterize the microstructure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} stress {{condition}} {{at the junction}} of the spherical shell with opening nozzle, using the finite element analysis, a finite element model is built {{in view of the}} same <b>spherical</b> shell <b>joining</b> a flatting nozzle and inside-stretching nozzles with different inner lengths differently. The maximum stress and stress distribution are got. All kinds of stresses are obtained by the total stress which is carried on linear processing. The result shows the inside-stretching nozzle can reduce the maximum stress in comparison with the flatting nozzle, mainly reducing the local membrane stress, but not the peak stress. The maximum stress falls with increasing the inner length of the nozzle to some extent, and beyond the extent, the maximum stress tends to reach a stable value basically without changing the inner length. The stress variation can effectively provide a reference for improving the strength of the spherical shell...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, a {{particle}} level simulation model was reported recently for investigating {{the effects of}} elongated particles on the microstructure and field-induced flow response in the ER fluid [70]. The particles were modeled {{as a collection of}} <b>spherical</b> subunits <b>joined</b> by Hookean type connectors, which enabled the modeling of the particle motion through the Newtonian carrier liquid. The simulation results showed that the systems containing elongated particles possessed enhanced stress response when compared with those containing spherical particles at the same volume fraction, and this was similar to that observed from the experiments by Otsubo [67]. Furthermore, it was also pointed out that the stress contribution arising from rotational effects depended on the average orientation vector of the particles at the commencement of the shearing [70]. If the majority of the particles were tilted towards the direction of shearing, a positive contribution to stress would arise as a result of particles rotating against the direction of shearing towards the applied field direction.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSpheres {{are known}} to be rigid {{geometric}} objects: they cannot be deformed isometrically, i. e. while preserving the length of curves, in a twice differentiable way. An unexpected result by J. Nash (Ann. of Math. 60 : 383 - 396, 1954) and N. Kuiper (Indag. Math. 17 : 545 - 555, 1955) shows that this is no longer the case if one requires the deformations to be only continuously differentiable. A remarkable consequence of their result makes possible the isometric reduction of a unit sphere inside an arbitrarily small ball. In particular, if one views the Earth as a round sphere the theory allows to reduce its diameter to that of a terrestrial globe while preserving geodesic distances. Here we describe the first explicit construction and visualization of such a reduced sphere. The construction amounts to solve a non-linear PDE with boundary conditions. The resulting surface consists of two unit <b>spherical</b> caps <b>joined</b> by a C 1 fractal equatorial belt. An intriguing question then arises about the transition between the smooth and the C 1 fractal geometries. We show that this transition is similar to the one observed when connecting a Koch curve to a line segment...|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} of the traversable wormhole joining with the exterior space-time are considered in details and the mixed boundary problem for the Einstein equations is formulated. It is shown that, in opposite to some declarations, the {{conditions of}} the wormhole joining with the exterior space-time have non-dynamical nature and can not be defined by the physical processes. The role of these conditions {{in the formation of the}} causal structure of space-time is analyzed. It is shown that the causal structure of the wormhole-type space-time models is independent from both the interior and exterior energy-momentum tensors. This statement is illustrated in the particular case of the <b>spherical</b> wormhole <b>joining</b> with flat exterior space-time. The same conditions, which define the wormhole joining with the exterior space-time, provide the absence of paradoxes in the models with causality violation. It is pointed out, that the nature and physical interpretation of the conditions of wormhole joining with the exterior space-time and induced boundary conditions for the field variables is one of the fundamental problems, which arise in the models with causality violation.

40|$|Nondestructive {{testing methods}} {{can be used}} to characterise archaeological finding. Microfocal {{radiography}} and micro computed tomography have been used to describe the internal structure of Celtic findings of graves. The paper describes the historical background, the archaeological context and the analysis of the manufacturing of <b>joined</b> <b>spherical</b> iron needles. The needles were found in graves of the Hallstatt period. It could be shown, that the results of the X-ray investigations demonstrate already the essential technical details and structures of the joining of the iron needles. A confirmation and detailed analysis could be performed by metallurgical investigations. The manufacturing of the joined needles demonstrates at a very early time the knowledge and control of a very difficult joining process. This is therefore of outstanding importance for the hstory of workmanship of the iron period...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the behavior of}} 5 -dimensional black strings, subject to the Gregory-Laflamme instability. Beyond the linear level, the evolving strings exhibit a rich dynamics, where at intermediate stages the horizon {{can be described as}} a sequence of 3 -dimensional <b>spherical</b> black holes <b>joined</b> by black string segments. These segments are themselves subject to a Gregory-Laflamme instability, resulting in a self-similar cascade, where ever-smaller satellite black holes form connected by ever-thinner string segments. This behavior is akin to satellite formation in low-viscosity fluid streams subject to the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. The simulation results imply that the string segments will reach zero radius in finite asymptotic time, whence the classical space-time terminates in a naked singularity. Since no fine-tuning is required to excite the instability, this constitutes a generic violation of cosmic censorship.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper which models the cell-cell (or virus-cell) fusion complex as two partial <b>spherical</b> vesicles <b>joined</b> at a narrow neck (Rubin, R. J., and Yi-der Chen. 1990. Biophys. J. 58 : 1157 - 1167), the {{redistribution}} by diffusion of lipid-like molecules through the neck {{between the two}} fused cell surfaces was studied. In this paper, we extend the study to the calculation of the kinetics of fluorescence increase in a single fusion complex when the lipid-like molecules are fluorescent and self-quenching. The formalism developed in this paper is useful in deducing fusion activation mechanisms from cuvette fluorescence measurements in cell-cell fusion systems. Two different procedures are presented: 1) an exact one {{which is based on}} the exact local density functions obtained from diffusion equations in our earlier study; and 2) an approximate one which is based on treating the kinetics of transfer of probes between the two fused cells as a two-state chemical reaction. For typical cell-cell fusion complexes, the fluorescence dequencing curves calculated from the exact and approximate procedures are very similar. Due to its simplicity, the approximate method should be very useful in future applications. The formalism is applied to a typical cell-cell fusion complex to study the sensitivity of dequenching curves to changes in various fusion parameters, such as the radii of the cells, the radius of the pore at the fusion junction, and the number of probes initially loaded to the complex...|$|R
5000|$|In the North American shows, a set {{of seven}} retractable, see-through LED-based lighted bead {{curtains}} hung behind and {{to the side of}} the stage, showing abstract patterns, maps, moving figures, and occasionally text. The curtain design permitted concertgoers around the arena to have an excellent view of the curtains above the band and the images they displayed. The roll-drop LED screens were designed by Fisher using 360deg golf-ball pixels developed with Frederic Opsomer of Innovative Designs in Belgium. The <b>spherical</b> LED product <b>joined</b> the BARCO product line as the Mi-Sphere.

High above the center stage hung the MiSphere strings, each containing 64 spheres and totaling nine meters long. Dynamic, [...] "moving" [...] lights were also embedded in the stage and the B-stage ramp, as well. Four screens suspended above the stage showed close-ups of each member of the band, another element reused from the Elevation Tour.|$|R
40|$|Some {{massive stars}} possess strong {{magnetic}} fields that confine plasma in the circumstellar environment. These magnetospheres {{have been studied}} spectroscopically, photometrically and, more recently, interferometrically. Here {{we report on the}} first firm detection of a magnetosphere in continuum linear polarization, as a result of monitoring of σ Ori E at the Pico dos Dias Observatory. The non-zero intrinsic polarization indicates an asymmetric structure, whose minor elongation axis is oriented 1500 east of the celestial north. A modulation of the polarization was observed, with a period of half of the rotation period, which supports the theoretical prediction of the presence of two diametrally opposed, co-rotating blobs of gas. A phase lag of - 0. 085 was detected between the polarization minimum and the primary minimum of the light curve, suggestive of a complex shape of the plasma clouds. We present a preliminary analysis of the data with the Rigidly Rotating Magnetosphere model, which could not reproduce simultaneously the photometric and polarimetric data. A toy model comprising two <b>spherical</b> co-rotating blobs <b>joined</b> by a thin disk proved more successful in reproducing the polarization modulation. With this model we were able to determine that the total scattering mass of the thin disk is similar to the mass of the blobs (2 M_ b/M_ d= 1. 2) and that the blobs are rotating counterclockwise on the plane of the sky. This result shows that polarimetry can provide a diagnostic of the geometry of clouds, which will serve as an important constraint for improving the Rigidly Rotating Magnetosphere model.
