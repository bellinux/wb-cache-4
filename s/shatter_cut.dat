50|$|Some {{time passes}} without sight of Olalla {{and when she}} finally appears, our hero falls desperately in love with her, and she with him. He recognizes an {{extraordinary}} intellect in the girl and expresses a desire to take {{her away from the}} decaying home of her kinsmen. They profess their love for each other, but Olalla urges the Scotsman to leave at once, keeping her always in his memory. He refuses, and during the night he breaks his window trying distractedly to open it. The <b>shattering</b> glass <b>cuts</b> his wrist and he applies to Olalla's mother for help. At the sight of his wound, she leaps upon him and bites into his arm. Felipe arrives in time to wrestle his mother away from our hero and Olalla tends to his injuries.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2011, she was sued by MTV {{reality show}} actress Samantha Swetra {{due to a}} {{physical}} altercation between the two. The pair became embroiled in an argument after de la Huerta began flirting with one of Swetra's male friends. De la Huerta became enraged when Swetra made snide remarks about her being intoxicated, and afterwards she allegedly hit the reality star in the face, before throwing a glass at her that <b>shattered</b> and <b>cut</b> her leg. De La Huerta was arrested, criminally charged with assault, issued a desk appearance ticket, and released for the same incident. When asked about the incident, De La Huerta stated; [...] "My lawyer says I’m not allowed {{to talk about the}} case. I so wish that I could." [...] "She’s an ex-reality-TV star who’s hungry for publicity. Just go on TMZ and look at her reported bruise. There ain’t no glass in her leg." ...|$|R
50|$|The Abbasid army {{formed a}} spear wall, a tactic they had adopted from their Syrian opponents, presumably from {{witnessing}} it in earlier battles. This entailed {{standing in a}} battle line with their lances pointed at the enemy (similar to the stakes used by English longbowmen at Agincourt and Crécy many centuries later). The Umayyad cavalry charged, possibly believing that with their experience they could break the spear wall. This was a mistake on their part, however, {{and they were all}} but butchered. The Umayyad army fell into retreat, its morale finally <b>shattered.</b> Many were <b>cut</b> down by the zealous Abbasids or were drowned in the wintertime River Zab.|$|R
5000|$|Luigi D'Andrea {{punched the}} little disks out of {{celluloid}} by hand, {{with a heavy}} mallet {{and a variety of}} knife edged dies which he designed. The cut edges were then finished by hand with sand paper. He also made the traditional tortoise shell picks the same way. The real shell came from Europe in irregularly shaped [...] "plates" [...] which were then soaked in oil and pressed between heated stainless steel plates for days. The plates were regularly tightened with a hand wheel. The pick material was then taken off the press hot and cut by hand with a steel die and wooden mallet, to get as many good picks as possible from the irregular plate. They had to work quickly because if the shell cooled or dried out, it would <b>shatter</b> when <b>cut.</b> The edges of the plate made thin picks, further in was medium, and the center supplied the thick gauge. They were then either tumbled or finished by hand on a sanding wheel. Some would have to be re-pressed flat again {{at the end of this}} process, for the gauges were never uniform. By comparison, the celluloid process was slightly simpler because the 2'x5', sheets were flat and uniformly gauged. It was readily available in the U.S. until the late 1960s, and only from Italy and Japan.|$|R
50|$|A <b>shattered,</b> revenge-seeking Radha <b>cuts</b> {{her hair}} short, trains in judo and karate,and then enters Billa’s gang after deceiving them into {{thinking}} that she too is {{on the wrong side}} of the law. Billa is impressed with her fighting skills and allows her to work for him, without realising her true intentions. Meanwhile, after a couple of unsuccessful attempts at nabbing Billa, the police finally succeed, but Billa dies during the pursuit, botching DSP Alexander’s plan to reach the source of all crime—the man Billa reported to — by capturing Billa alive. DSP buries Billa’s body, ensuring that people believe that he is still be alive. Alexander remembers his chance encounter with Rajappa, a simpleton trying to survive in the hustle and bustle of Chennai to support two small foster children, who is a doppelganger of Billa. Alexander hatches a plan to transform Rajappa into Billa and place him back into the crime nexus, but this time as a police informer.|$|R
50|$|Davey {{has spent}} the first night after the {{incident}} with an empathetic social worker, Renee. However, she places the boy with a cold-hearted, disciplinarian foster mother who immediately declares to the boy {{that she would have}} preferred a girl. Later on, after being confined to his room for insulting the foster mother while she berated him in the kitchen, he escapes by shattering first a picture frame on the wall, and then used the <b>shattered</b> class to <b>cut</b> out the screen in the open window. The authorities are alerted and a missing persons search is initiated. The boy obtains train conductor Tom Stark's home address. He turns up at the Starks' home and berates Tom for accidentally killing his mother in the train crash, but eventually he is placated. Tom's wife Megan insists on letting the boy stay although Tom initially disapproves. Caring for Davey gradually helps the couple rebond with each other.|$|R
50|$|Sauron arose {{again and}} {{challenged}} them. The Elves allied with Men {{to form the}} Last Alliance. For seven years, the Alliance laid siege to Barad-dûr, until at last Sauron himself joined the battle field. And there he slew Elendil, High King of Gondor and Arnor, as well as Gil-galad, King of the Elves of Middle-earth. But when it seemed all was lost, Isildur took up the hilt of Narsil, his father's now <b>shattered</b> sword, and <b>cut</b> the One Ring from Sauron's hand. And Sauron was defeated, but not utterly destroyed. For Isildur ignored the counsel of Elrond, and rather than destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, he kept it for himself. But the Ring betrayed him, as it slipped from his finger as he was escaping from an Orc ambush at the Gladden Fields. Isildur was slain, and the Ring fell into the Anduin River, where it was lost for a time.|$|R
50|$|The {{supercell}} produced damage over a {{large area}} (about 50 mi long and 10 mi wide) in southern and central Tarrant County. Hail as large as 4 in in diameter fell on the 10,000 people at around 7:30 pm CDT. This led to 90 injuries requiring hospital treatment, including broken bones, lacerations and deep bruises, with many more minor injuries. Many people sheltered in cars after being caught outside in the hail, but the windshields <b>shattered,</b> causing numerous <b>cuts</b> from the broken glass. The large hail damaged cars, roofs and houses. Over 80 reports of significant damage were reported, with tiled buildings bearing {{the brunt of the}} damage. The Fort Worth Savings and Loan buildings were almost destroyed. Many cars were completely destroyed, and several houses severely damaged. The western part of Fort Worth, in the Ridglea and Ridgmar areas where many of the houses and commercial structures feature slate tile roofs, experienced catastrophic damage to roofs and underlying structures. The storm also cut power to 55,000 homes in the Tarrant area of Fort Worth.|$|R
40|$|In many seismically active areas (e. g. Italy, Greece) earthquakes, {{sometimes}} destructive, nucleate within (aftershocks surely do) and propagate through carbonates in {{the upper}} crust (e. g. L’Aquila earthquake, 2009, Mw 6. 1). Seismology, geophysics and geodesy furnish key parameters related to the earthquake source (e. g. seismic moment, static stress drop, radiated energy) but lack sufficient resolution to constrain detailed three-dimensional fault zone geometry and coseismic on- and off-fault deformation processes at scales relevant to earthquake physics. 	In this thesis it is proposed to study the internal structure and mechanics of fault zones hosted in carbonate rocks using a multidisciplinary approach, complementary to the seismological-based one. This includes detailed structural survey to quantify the architecture of exhumed fault zones in carbonates both by field and remote sensed methods (e. g. use of a drone to get high-resolution aerial images), rock deformation experiments under conditions relevant to the seismic cycle (e. g. use of rotary shear apparatus, uniaxial press, Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar), microstructural-mineralogical characterization (optical and scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe analyses, X-ray powder diffraction, cathodoluminescence, X-ray microtomography, white light interferometry, image analysis) of natural and experimental fault rocks to infer the physico-chemical processes occurring during earthquakes. 	Two fault zones cutting dolostones exhumed from 50 s- 1) uniaxial compression tests on dolostone rock cylinders. At applied normal stresses and displacements consistent with those estimated for the FFZ, experimental mirror-like fault surfaces comparable to the natural examples (e. g. clast truncation along fault surfaces, similar surface roughness) were formed in rotary-shear experiments only at seismic slip rates (v ≥ 0. 1 m/s). I suggest therefore that small-displacement mirror-like fault surfaces developed in dolostone gouge layers represent markers of seismic slip. In-situ shattered dolostones {{similar to those found}} within the FFZ (i. e. rock fragments up to a few millimeters in size elongated in the stress wave loading direction, incipient zones of microfracturing down to the micrometer scale) were formed during uniaxial compression tests only above strain rates of 200 s- 1. The association of in-situ <b>shattered</b> dolostones <b>cut</b> by discrete mirror-like fault surfaces is interpreted to record the propagation of multiple earthquake ruptures within the shallow crustal portions of the FFZ. 	Lastly, the structural complexity of the studied fault zones in terms of three-dimensional geometry of the fault-fracture network, fault rock spatial distribution, fault orientation and kinematics, compares favorably to the predicted damage distribution in three-dimensional earthquake rupture simulations, as well as the structure of active seismic sources hosted in carbonate rocks as illuminated by seismological technique...|$|R
