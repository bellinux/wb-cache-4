5|$|Affleck had {{a three-year}} {{relationship}} with actress Gwyneth Paltrow from 1997 to 2000. They began dating in October 1997 after meeting at a Miramax dinner, and later {{worked together on}} <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> <b>Love</b> (1998). Although they first broke up in January 1999, months later, Paltrow persuaded Affleck to co-star with her in Bounce (2000) and they soon resumed their relationship. They separated again in October 2000. In a 2015 interview, Paltrow said she and Affleck remain friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{nominated}} for eleven Academy Awards, and won five including Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Film Editing, and Best Director for Spielberg, but lost the Best Picture award to <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> <b>Love,</b> being {{one of a few}} that have won the Best Director award without also winning Best Picture. The Academy's decision to not award the film with the Best Picture Oscar has resulted in much criticism in recent years, with many considering it as one of the biggest snubs in the ceremony's history.|$|E
5|$|The {{play has}} been widely adapted for TV and film. In 1960, Peter Ustinov's cold-war stage parody, Romanoff and Juliet was filmed. The 1961 film of West Side Story—set among New York gangs–featured the Jets as white youths, {{equivalent}} to Shakespeare's Montagues while the Sharks, equivalent to the Capulets, are Puerto Rican. The 1994 film The Punk uses both the rough plot outline of Romeo and Juliet and names many {{of the characters in}} ways that reflect the characters in the play. In 2006, Disney's High School Musical made use of Romeo and Juliet plot, placing the two young lovers in different high school cliques instead of feuding families. Film-makers have frequently featured characters performing scenes from Romeo and Juliet. The conceit of dramatising Shakespeare writing Romeo and Juliet has been used several times, including John Madden's 1998 <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> <b>Love,</b> in which Shakespeare writes the play against the backdrop of his own doomed love affair. An anime series produced by Gonzo and SKY Perfect Well Think, called Romeo x Juliet, was made in 2007 and the 2013 version is the latest English-language film based on the play. In 2013, Sanjay Leela Bhansali directed the Bollywood film Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, a contemporary version of the play which starred Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone in leading roles. The film was a commercial and critical success. In February 2014, BroadwayHD released a filmed version of the 2013 Broadway Revival of Romeo and Juliet. The production starred Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad. The film was released internationally in April 2014.|$|E
5000|$|The term in English is {{typically}} {{used with a}} negative connotation to refer {{to someone who is}} over-concerned with [...] and whose tone is condescending.

50|$|In 1593, Bacon {{paid for}} his friend Antonio Pérez to come to England. Pérez {{may have been the}} model for the {{character}} of Don Adriana de Armado <b>in</b> <b>Shakespeare's</b> <b>Love's</b> Labour's Lost. <b>In</b> 1593 Bacon was also elected member of Parliament for Wallingford, Berkshire.|$|R
50|$|Arterton won {{her first}} {{professional}} role in Stephen Poliakoff's Capturing Mary {{while she was}} still at drama school.

She made her film debut in St Trinian's (2007) as Head Girl Kelly.|$|R
25|$|London in the Elizabethan Era {{has often}} been portrayed in films, {{including}} Fire Over England (1937), The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939), and Elizabeth (1998). Much of <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> <b>Love</b> (1998), a comedy involving Shakespeare in a fictionalised romance, was set around the original Globe Theatre, as was Laurence Olivier's 1944 Henry V.|$|E
25|$|Miramax won {{its first}} Academy Award for Best Picture in 1997 with {{the victory of}} The English Patient. (Pulp Fiction was {{nominated}} in 1995 but lost to Forrest Gump). This started a string of critical successes that included Good Will Hunting (1997) and <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> <b>Love</b> (1998), both of which won several awards, including numerous Academy Awards.|$|E
25|$|Anne is {{depicted}} in fiction during the 19th century, when Shakespeare starts to become a figure in wider national and popular culture. Emma Severn's novel Anne Hathaway, or, <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> <b>Love</b> (1845) portrays an idealised romance and happy marriage in an idyllic rural Stratford. She also appears in William Black's 1884 novel Judith Shakespeare about her daughter, portrayed as a conventional dutiful wife and concerned parent with a wayward daughter.|$|E
50|$|Cuckoos {{have played}} a role in human culture for {{thousands}} of years, appearing in Greek mythology as sacred to the goddess Hera. In Europe, the cuckoo is associated with spring, and with cuckoldry, for example <b>in</b> <b>Shakespeare's</b> <b>Love's</b> Labours Lost. <b>In</b> India, cuckoos are sacred to Kamadeva, the god of desire and longing, whereas in Japan, the cuckoo symbolises unrequited love.|$|R
50|$|The legend is {{mentioned}} <b>in</b> <b>Shakespeare's</b> <b>Love's</b> Labour's Lost, Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and Henry/B IV. A ballad telling the tale {{is included in}} Richard Johnson's anthology Crown Garland of Goulden Roses (1612), and in Thomas Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry (1765), but the origin is otherwise obscure. The girl's name is variously given as Penelophon or Zenelophon.|$|R
5000|$|After the film's release, certain publications, {{including}} Private Eye, noted strong {{similarities between}} the film and the 1941 novel No Bed for Bacon, by Caryl Brahms and S. J. Simon, which also features <b>Shakespeare</b> falling <b>in</b> <b>love</b> and finding inspiration for his later plays. In a foreword to a subsequent edition of No Bed for Bacon (which traded on the association by declaring itself [...] "A Story of Shakespeare and Lady Viola in Love") Ned Sherrin, Private Eye insider and former writing partner of Brahms', confirmed that he had lent {{a copy of the}} novel to Stoppard after he joined the writing team, but that the basic plot of the film had been independently developed by Marc Norman, who was unaware of the earlier work.|$|R
25|$|The {{romantic comedy}} film <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> <b>Love</b> {{provides}} an example of the negative view, depicting the marriage as a cold and loveless bond that Shakespeare must escape to find love in London. The same situation occurs in the alternate-history novel Ruled Britannia (2002), in which Shakespeare is finally granted a divorce from Hathaway to marry his new girlfriend after he helps to liberate England from Spanish dominion. A similarly loveless relationship is depicted in the film A Waste of Shame (2005).|$|E
25|$|Also, in 2007 {{work was}} already {{underway}} on {{a feature film}} about Ingrid Jonker with the working title All that Breaks. Based on a script by Helena Nogueira workshopped at Johannesburg's Market Theatre, the film focusses on {{three years in the}} life of Jonker and the Sestigers who gathered around poet Uys Krige at Clifton in Cape Town. The film is produced by David Parfitt (<b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> <b>Love),</b> Charles Moore (Schindler's List) and Shan Moodley and is directed by Nogueira.|$|E
25|$|He made a cameo {{appearance}} in the film The Tall Guy (1989), {{and was one of}} five of the Are You Being Served? cast to be reunited in character for the sitcom Grace & Favour (titled Are You Being Served? Again! in the United States), which ran for twelve episodes in 1992 and 1993. Inman had a small part as Lady Capulet in the film <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> <b>Love</b> (1998) and appeared in the 1999 French and Saunders Christmas special. He appeared as Father Chinwag in the film The Mumbo Jumbo (2000).|$|E
2500|$|From the 16th {{until the}} 18th century the cittern {{was a common}} English barber shop instrument, kept in waiting areas for {{customers}} to entertain themselves and others with, and popular sheet music for the instrument was published to that end.

50|$|Beginning {{around the}} same time as his rugby league career, Fogerty began acting and has played {{supporting}} roles in several films such as Shooting Fish and Played, as well as the unlicensed boxer, Gorgeous George, in the Guy Ritchie crime caper Snatch. He played Mouse in Mean Machine and Raw in Greenfingers. He has also worked on soaps Coronation Street and Hollyoaks. In 2012 he joined Barrie Rutter's Northern Broadsides theatre company to play Costard <b>in</b> <b>Shakespeare's</b> <b>Love's</b> Labour's Lost.|$|R
50|$|For millennia, poultices of {{plantain}} leaves {{have been}} applied to wounds, sores, and stings to promote healing. (The clown Costard cries out for a plantain after cutting his shin <b>in</b> <b>Shakespeare's</b> <b>Love's</b> Labour's Lost.) The active constituents are the anti-microbial compound aucubin, the cell-growth promoter allantoin, {{a large amount of}} soothing mucilage, flavonoids, caffeic acid derivatives, and alcohols in the wax on the leaf surface. The root of plantain was also traditionally used to treat wounds, as well as to treat fever and respiratory infections.|$|R
25|$|Two Gentlemen is also {{featured}} in <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> <b>Love</b> (1999). Directed by John Madden and written by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, the film tells the fictional story of William Shakespeare's (Joseph Fiennes) composition of Romeo and Juliet. Early in the film, Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench) attends {{a production of}} Two Gentlemen, greatly enjoying William Kempe (Patrick Barlow) being thoroughly outperformed by Crab, and then falling asleep during Henry Condell's (Nicholas Boulton) recitation of Proteus' soliloquy from Act 2, Scene 1. Later, after reading {{the first draft of}} Romeo and Ethel, theatre manager Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) suggests that Shakespeare add a dog to liven the play up.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{set of the}} Charenton (asylum) in Quills {{was built}} at Pinewood Studios, {{where most of the}} filming took place. Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire, and London stood in for the exterior shots of early 19th century France. Oscar-winning production designer Martin Childs (<b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> <b>Love)</b> imagined the primary location of Charenton as an airy, though circuitous place, darkening as Royer-Collard takes over operations. The screenplay specifies the way the inmates' rooms link together, which {{plays a key role in}} the relay of the Marquis' climactic story to Madeleine. Screenwriter/playwright Doug Wright was a constant presence on set, assisting the actors and producers in interpreting the script and bringing his vision to life.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{in which}} film-makers and authors use Shakespearean texts is to feature {{characters}} who are actors performing those texts, within a wider non-Shakespearean story. Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet are the two plays which have most often been used in this way. Usually, Shakespeare's story has some parallel or resonance with the main plot. Films featuring characters performing scenes from Romeo and Juliet include the 1912 and 1982 film versions of Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby, Cured Hams (1927), Drama De Luxe (1927), Broadway Fever (1928), Les amants de Vérone (1949), Marjorie Morningstar (1958), Carry on Teacher (1959) Shakespeare Wallah (1965) and, significantly, <b>Shakespeare</b> <b>in</b> <b>Love</b> (1998).|$|E
50|$|The term 'reckoning' {{is used in}} its {{multiple}} meanings {{throughout the}} <b>Shakespeare</b> canon. <b>In</b> <b>Love's</b> Labour's Lost <b>in</b> particular, it {{is often used to}} signify a moral judgement; most notably, the idea of a final reckoning as it relates to death. Though the play entwines fantasy and reality, the arrival of the messenger to announce the death of the Princess's father ultimately brings this notion to a head. Scholar Cynthia Lewis suggested that the appearance of the final reckoning is necessary in reminding the lovers of the seriousness of marriage. The need to settle the disagreement between Navarre and France likewise suggests an instance of reckoning, though this particular reckoning is settled offstage. This is presented {{in stark contrast to the}} final scene, in which the act of reckoning cannot be avoided. In acknowledging the consequences of his actions, Don Armado is the only one to deal with his reckoning in a noble manner. The Lords and the King effectively pass judgement on themselves, revealing their true moral character when mocking the players during the representation of the Nine Worthies.|$|R
50|$|A {{graduate}} of the Yale School of Drama, Mesnik's theatrical resume encompasses Broadway (La Bête; Oh! Calcutta!), Off-Broadway (Modigliani; A Weekend Near Madison; Smoke On The Mountain; The Good Times Are Killing Me; The Rimers of Eldritch - and others), major regional venues such as Yale Rep, The Old Globe, McCarter Theatre, The Kennedy Center, and Actors Theater of Louisville, and European-American collaborative productions of Shakespeare's King Lear and Chekhov’s Ivanov (Moscow Art Theatre). In 2002, he was nominated for an Ovation Award {{for his role as}} Holofernes <b>in</b> <b>Shakespeare's</b> <b>Love's</b> Labours Lost,produced by A Noise Within.|$|R
50|$|In June 1981 she reprised {{her role}} as Kate Nickleby in The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby for the Royal Shakespeare Company with Alun Armstrong and Ian McNeice added to the cast, Ben Kingsley and Timothy Spall having left the production. This version was filmed by Channel 4 in 1982 and {{broadcast}} as four two-hour episodes on consecutive nights in November 1982. She appeared in the play during its fourteen-week run at the Plymouth Theatre on Broadway, opening on 22 September 1981.
