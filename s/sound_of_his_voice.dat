25|$|Kozlovsky was {{well-known}} to be a favourite {{singer of}} Joseph Stalin. Stalin used to invite Kozlovsky {{to come over}} whenever he wanted {{to listen to the}} <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> even {{in the middle of the}} night. So pleased was Stalin with Kozlovsky's singing, that he once kissed him and then himself sang to the piano accompaniment of Kozlovsky. Kozlovsky gained great renown throughout the Soviet Union, but was never allowed to leave its borders.|$|E
25|$|He {{formed a}} three-man group with his cousins, Robert Diggs and Russell Jones, {{who would later}} be known as RZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard. At the time he didn't like the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> The group, FOI: Force of the Imperial Master, and later All in Together, saw the three rapping and DJing, {{switching}} names and performing local shows; since they lived in different boroughs, GZA and Ol' Dirty would travel from Brooklyn out to Staten Island {{to meet up with}} their cousin RZA, after which the three would travel across New York City and challenge other MCs to battles. He left school in the 10th grade, but nurtured his affection for science as he developed his skills as a lyricist.|$|E
500|$|Turner interviewed flautist John Payne for the book, who had {{sat in on}} {{sessions}} with Van Morrison and later collaborated with him. Payne comments on their work together on the album Astral Weeks, which also included musicians Connie Kay, Warren Smith, Jay Berliner, and Richard Davis: [...] "Ironically, the image you have {{when you listen to}} the album now is of these guys who are all together, and they realise they are creating a monumental work of art. The fact is that it was just another session for them." [...] Payne states of his observations of Van Morrison's performance style: [...] "When (Van) was on stage, he would look like a space cadet, but then he'd open his mouth and you would realize that he had channeled everything into the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> The rest of it was just a shell that was there for the purpose of producing this noise." ...|$|E
60|$|The last <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{died out}} in the distance; and she was left alone in her room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sway away!" [...] echoed Nightingale, seconding the hoarse <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> by {{the winding}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> call; [...] "away {{with them to}} heaven." ...|$|R
60|$|An air of sullen dissatisfaction pervaded {{the manner}} of the hunter during the whole <b>of</b> <b>his</b> speech; yet he thought it prudent to utter the close of the {{sentence}} in such an undertone as to leave nothing audible but the grumbling <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|R
500|$|La Dispute {{recorded}} {{the remainder of}} the album in a month in StadiumRed in New York City in April 2011. Dreyer wanted to give the album the most organic feel possible by using no artificial reverb or studio techniques that would give the album a synthesized quality. Joe Pedulla stated that he wanted to give the album a more raw and authentic sound: [...] "We were just trying to capture {{what it would be like}} for an audience member sitting and listening to a guitar in a room." [...] He also credited Dreyer's vocal range: [...] "Jordan Dreyer has this crazy dynamic range â€“ a 20dB swing from how loud and quiet he gets. So there are some vocal parts with no resonance at all, where he's speaking/singing softly, the room is not echoing, and he sounds close and in-your-face. Then the dynamic swing happens, and we would see how big it can get." [...] When recording vocals, Dreyer makes very long takes, trying to emulate the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> in live performances. The album's recording features what the band considers [...] "auxiliary instrumentation", including trumpet and rhodes piano, and even improvised instruments that Sterenburg's brother created out of scrap metal.|$|E
60|$|At the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> the King's face lighted up with intelligence.|$|E
60|$|She saw nothing, and the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{seemed to}} touch her.|$|E
60|$|Coming {{into that}} upstairs room that was {{common to all}} the troupe, he found M. Binet talking loudly and vehemently. He had caught <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> whilst yet upon the stairs. As he entered Binet broke off short, and wheeled to face him.|$|R
60|$|The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother's <b>voice</b> quieted Davidson, {{and at once}} {{restored}} his memory.|$|R
6000|$|... "The very man," [...] {{interrupted}} Borroughcliffe; [...] "I thought I recollected {{the liquid}} <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> It {{will be well}} {{to speak to him}} of the good fare of St. Ruth; and you may add, that I know my man: I shall besiege, instead of storming him, with the certainty of a surrender when his canteen is empty. The vault he is in holds no such beverage as the cellars of the Abbey." ...|$|R
60|$|At the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{the woman}} peered {{at him with}} quick curiousness.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not imagine}} that any human beings were within <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
60|$|The look of his smile, the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> sent {{a shudder}} through her.|$|E
60|$|He {{had become}} unused to talking, {{and he was}} not acquainted with the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own <b>voice.</b> It seemed hoarse and strange.|$|R
60|$|Sam {{gave way}} at last, as arter {{all he could}} see it was the safest thing to do, but he 'ad so much to say about it that they got fair sick <b>of</b> the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>'is</b> <b>voice.</b> They 'ad to go 'ome for 'im to put the belt on; and then at seven o'clock in the evening, arter Sam had 'ad two or three pints, they had to go 'ome agin, 'cos he was {{complaining}} of tight-lacing.|$|R
60|$|And in London another Lord Greystoke was {{speaking}} to HIS kind in the House of Lords, but none trembled at the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soft <b>voice.</b>|$|R
60|$|At the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> she recollected, and {{her tears}} and her weeping returned.|$|E
60|$|The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> the {{clean-cut}} and droll geniality; seemed new and delightful to Helen.|$|E
60|$|The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> was {{instantly}} {{followed by a}} cry from the bed-chamber--a cry of terror.|$|E
6000|$|And, humming his rustic roundelay, the yeoman went on <b>his</b> road, the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rough <b>voice</b> {{gradually}} dying away as {{the distance}} betwixt them increased: ...|$|R
50|$|Brother Jerome: Confessor of the novices at the Abbey. He {{is a man}} {{who loves}} the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own <b>voice,</b> and is a stickler for rules.|$|R
50|$|Heaven's Open is Oldfield's only album {{where he}} {{performs}} all the lead vocals himself, {{due to his}} having {{come to terms with}} the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own <b>voice.</b>|$|R
60|$|The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{was utterly}} unlike his own, and Kirsteen, {{starting}} forward, {{put her arm}} round him.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he added}} suddenly, {{and the very}} <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{suggested}} that he hardly believed his own words.|$|E
60|$|She {{stopped at}} the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> dropped her hold on her husband's arm, and faced her brother, shuddering.|$|E
60|$|Even Allan's {{careless}} nature {{felt the}} solemn {{influence of the}} time. The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own <b>voice</b> startled him when he looked down and hailed his friend on deck.|$|R
60|$|His {{proposition}} {{was apparently}} acceded to; for, at the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> powerful <b>voice,</b> the figure sank upon the ground, exhibiting a shapeless ball of black, without life or motion.|$|R
60|$|So far, the {{performance}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> duty appeared easy to the stranger, {{and he gave}} the required directions in those still, calm tones, that formed so remarkable a contrast to the responsibility <b>of</b> <b>his</b> situation. But when the land was becoming dim, in distance as well as darkness, and the agitated sea alone was to be discovered as it swept by them in foam, he broke in upon the monotonous roaring of the tempest with the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> seeming to shake off his apathy, and rouse himself to the occasion.|$|R
60|$|Lucy flushed at the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> {{and anger}} and sudden hatred took {{the place of}} all other feelings.|$|E
6000|$|At the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{the young}} Pole started, looked up, and exclaimed, with the vivacity of a foreigner, in German,-- ...|$|E
60|$|At the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> Margery {{turned her}} head and started, {{and in the same}} instant she was on her feet.|$|E
60|$|Dominick {{could do}} nothing to prevent this. While staring at the little patch of foam where {{the two men had}} gone down, he was startled by the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sister's <b>voice.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was merely}} because I didn't think it right," [...] said Archie, who, {{now that he}} had worked himself into the vein, liked the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own <b>voice.</b> [...] "It was indeed." ...|$|R
60|$|Rooney {{began this}} remark aloud, but the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own <b>voice</b> was so horribly loud and unnaturally near that he {{finished}} {{off in a}} whisper, and continued his observations in that confidential tone.|$|R
