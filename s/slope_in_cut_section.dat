40|$|A {{case history}} of shallow {{sloughing}} within cut slopes of an irrigation canal in salt-rich clayey colluvium R. S. Globa and S. L. Barbour Abstract: An investigation and remediation of instability along cut slopes of an irrigation canal in salt-rich clayey col-luvium in southern Alberta is described. Random sloughing {{of the canal}} side slopes began to occur 2 years after con-struction over a 7500 m length of canal and was nearly continuous over a 2500 m length 3 years later. The sloughs are shallow seated and most had {{the appearance of a}} “mud ” flow. Soil salinity also developed along the canal slopes due to capillarity and evaporation. Failure of the clay <b>slopes</b> <b>in</b> the <b>cut</b> <b>sections</b> is attributed to swelling, dispersion, and softening of the subgrade due to exposure of the salt-laden clays to fresh water. In contrast, 600 m of salt-rich clayey colluvium compacted as a clay liner on the canal side slopes showed no evidence of sloughing and salt loading after 9 years of service. Good soil compaction inhibited softening and <b>slope</b> instability <b>in</b> these salt-rich soils. Results from de-tailed site investigations and observations, and the interplay of soil chemistry and geology, facilitated the selection of a satisfactory method of repair. Repairs consisted of reconstructing 2500 m of canal by overexcavating the canal subgrade and replacing those soils with compacted soil...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDue to thermal {{nature of}} laser cutting, high {{temperature}} and thermal stresses are {{developed at the}} cut edge that affects finally the cut edge quality. This paper aims for developing a numerical simulation model to predict the temperature and residual stresses in the laser cutting of Aluminium alloy (Al- 2024). The temperature and stress fields developed <b>in</b> <b>cut</b> <b>section</b> are predicted numerically using ANSYS finite element code. For the analysis, Fourier law of heat conduction and Gaussian distribution of a laser beam are considered. Temperature dependent thermo-physical properties of the material are used in numerical simulation. It is found that high temperature gradient exists at laser irradiated spot which results in high thermal stresses across the <b>cut</b> <b>section.</b> Also {{it has been found}} that the maximum temperature obtained during laser cutting is reduced with increasing laser scanning velocity. Stress distribution results shows that stresses attains low values at laser irradiated spot because of the reduction of thermal expansion coefficient with increasing temperature.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of normal {{strength}} self-compacting concrete (SCC) mixes with a maximum aggregate size (g) of 20 mm ranging in compressive strength from 30 to 80 MPa were prepared in the laboratory, and the times t 500 and tstop of each mix were recorded in the slump flow test. The entire cone flow test was then simulated {{from the moment the}} cone was lifted until the mix stopped to flow using the three-dimensional mesh-less smoothed particle hydrodynamics computational approach, treating the SCC mix as a non-Newtonian Bingham fluid. This numerical simulation had two aims. First, to investigate whether the yield stress τy of the mix could be accurately estimated from the measured t 500 and tstop times knowing the plastic viscosity of the mix. The latter was estimated by a micromechanical procedure. Second, to compare the distribution of coarse aggregate particles larger than or equal to 8 mm in the cone spread after it stopped to flow as revealed by the numerical simulation with the distribution of the aggregate particles of the corresponding sizes <b>in</b> the <b>cut</b> <b>sections</b> of the cured test cone spread.

Although the hilly area is usually categorized as the landslide prone area, the Southern part of the country has faced the slope failures and the erosion problems time to time. As an erosion/slope protection of slopes using mechanical structures is costly to establish and maintain, biotechnical slope protection is an alternative which is more aesthetically pleasing and cost effective.

To explore {{the relationship between}} the IF pattern and the location of antibody binding, two immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (12 A 1 and 13 F 1) that differ in protective efficacy and IF pattern and one protective IgG 1 MAb (2 H 1) were studied by IF and electron microscopy (EM). Fixing C. neoformans cells in lung tissue for EM resulted in significantly better preservation of the capsule than fixing yeast cells in suspension. The localization of MAbs 12 A 1 and 13 F 1 by immunogold EM differed depending on whether the MAb was bound to cells <b>in</b> <b>cut</b> tissue <b>sections</b> embedded <b>in</b> plastic or to cells <b>in</b> solution. <b>In</b> <b>cut</b> tissue <b>sections,</b> MAbs 12 A 1 and 13 F 1 bound throughout the capsule, whereas in solution both MAbs bound near the capsule surface. To investigate whether antibody binding to the C. neoformans capsule affected the binding of other primary or secondary reagents, various combinations of MAbs 12 A 1, 13 F 1, and 2 H 1 were studied by direct and indirect IF. The IF pattern and location of binding for MAbs 12 A 1, 13 F 1, and 2 H 1 varied depending on the presence of other capsule-binding MAbs and the method of detection. The results show that (i) binding of MAbs to the C. neoformans polysaccharide capsule can modify the binding of subsequent primary or secondary antibodies; (ii) the IgM MAbs bind primarily to the outer capsule regions despite the occurrence of their epitopes throughout the capsule; and (iii) MAb 2 H 1 staining of newly formed buds is reduced, suggesting quantitative or qualitative differences in bud capsule...|$|R

The present report focuses on epidemiological, clinical and histopathological findings {{in a case}} of fatal disseminated angiostrongylosis in a dog living in southern Italy and provides data on the extent of the spread of Angiostrongylus vasorum in the same area. Case presentation: A 4 -year-old female English Setter from the Campania region of southern Italy was referred with a 2 -week history of cough and severe respiratory distress that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy. Based on clinical, radiological, echographical and cytological findings (including the presence of larvae), a suspect diagnosis of lungworm infection was performed. After few days the dog died due to progressive clinical aggravation. Complete postmortem examination was conducted within 24 hours from death and samples from lungs, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, stomach and small intestine were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin. Grossly, several hemorrhagic foci were observed mostly in the lungs, liver, kidney. Microscopically, the lungs contained numerous, multifocal to coalescing granulomas composed of epitheliod macrophages, multinucleated giant cells and some neutrophils, frequently associated with parasite eggs and larvae. The lungs contained many firm nodules, many adult nematodes approximately 1. 5 to 2 cm in length were observed <b>in</b> <b>cut</b> <b>sections</b> and identified as A. vasorum. A subsequent parasitological survey performed with FLOTAC on stray dogs living in the same area showed the presence of A. vasorum larvae in 17 of 1639 stray dogs examined (1. 04 %). Conclusion: This survey provides new data on distribution of A. vasorum and underlines that canine angiostrongylosis should be considered as differential diagnosis in dogs...|$|R

Cell Biol. 88 : 257 - 267). Based on these techniques, absolute quantitative standardization has been established through x-ray analysis of frozen-hydrated and then dried sections of independently measured standard solutions of elements. These experiments demonstrate that the specific techniques employed have a probable error of less than 10 %. Artificial electrolyte gradients established in gelatin were subjected to analysis to determine whether there was elemental displacement under non-membrane- limited conditions at the temperatures employed for sectioning (- 30 degrees to - 40 degrees C). No significant difference was observed between such gradients <b>in</b> serial <b>sections</b> <b>cut</b> at - 30 degrees and - 80 degrees C.

Thus, in terms of ice-crystal size, gradient maintenance, and compartmental differentiation, cryosectioning at - 30 degrees to - 40 degrees C was not associated with redistribution incompatible with 1 - to 2 -micrometers spatial resolution, and absolute measurements of elemental concentration were practical within regions of this size...|$|R
