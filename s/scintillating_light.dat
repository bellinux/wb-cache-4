We ate dinner, a hurried and anxious meal {{for me with}} {{eighteen}} men abroad on the sea and beyond the bulge of the earth, and with that heaven-rolling mountain range of clouds moving slowly down upon us. Wolf Larsen did not seem affected, however; though I noticed, {{when we returned to}} the deck, a slight twitching of the nostrils, a perceptible quickness of movement. His face was stern, the lines of it had grown hard, and yet in his eyes—blue, clear blue this day—there was a strange brilliancy, a bright <b>scintillating</b> <b>light.</b> It struck me that he was joyous, in a ferocious sort of way; that he was glad there was an impending struggle; that he was thrilled and upborne with knowledge that one of the great moments of living, when the tide of life surges up in flood, was upon him.|$|E
60|$|Many years afterward, {{when the}} church, that {{contained}} the monuments of the Shrewsbury family, was desecrated by Cromwell's soldiers, they broke open the ancestral vaults, and stole whatever was valuable from the noble personages who reposed there. Merlin's antique ring {{passed into the}} possession of a stout sergeant of the Ironsides, who thus became subject to the influences of the evil spirit that still kept his abode within the gem's enchanted depths. The sergeant was soon slain in battle, thus transmitting the ring, though without any legal form of testament, to a gay cavalier, who forthwith pawned it, and expended the money in liquor, which speedily {{brought him to the}} grave. We next catch the sparkle of the magic diamond at various epochs of the merry reign of Charles the Second. But its sinister fortune still attended it. From whatever hand this ring of portent came, and whatever finger it encircled, ever it was the pledge of deceit between man and man, or man and woman, of faithless vows, and unhallowed passion; and whether to lords and ladies, or to village-maids,--for sometimes it found its way so low,--still it brought nothing but sorrow and disgrace. No purifying deed was done, to drive the fiend from his bright home in this little star. Again, we hear of it at a later period, when Sir Robert Walpole bestowed the ring, among far richer jewels, on the lady of a British legislator, whose political honor he wished to undermine. Many a dismal and unhappy tale might be wrought out of its other adventures. All this while, its ominous tinge of dusky red had been deepening and darkening, until, if laid upon white paper, it cast the mingled hue of night and blood, strangely illuminated with <b>scintillating</b> <b>light,</b> in a circle round about.

40|$|AbstractThe CRESST {{experiment}} (Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers) {{searches for}} dark matter via the phonon and light signals of elastic scattering processes in scintillating crystals. The discrimination between a possible dark matter signal and background {{is based on}} the light yield. We present a new method for evaluating the two characteristics of a phonon/light detector module that determine how much of the deposited energy is converted to scintillation light and how efficiently a module detects the produced light. In contrast to former approaches with dedicated setups, we developed a method which allows us to use data taken with the cryogenic setup, during a dark matter search phase. In this way, we accounted for the entire process that occurs in a detector module, and obtained information on the light emission of the crystal as well as information on the performance of the module (light transport and detection). We found that with the detectors operated in CRESST-II phase 1, about 20 % of the produced scintillation light is detected. A part of the light is likely absorbed by creating meta-stable excitations in the <b>scintillating</b> crystals.

40|$|A novel {{real-time}} {{optical fibre}} X-Ray dosimeter for monitoring the radiation pulses delivered from a clinical linear accelerator (Linac) is presented. The {{primary focus of}} the sensor is to measure low doses of ionising X-ray radiation in real time (limited to 0. 1 -ms gate time of the detector). The sensor tip material scintillates upon exposure to X-ray energy and the resultant low-level visible light signal is coupled to a polymethyl methacrylate plastic optical fibre, {{which is used to}} guide it towards a distal avalanche photodiode-based detector.

40|$|Current {{and future}} high energy physics {{particle}} colliders are capable to provide instantaneous luminosities of 1034 cm^(- 2) s^(- 1) and above. The high {{center of mass}} energy, {{the large number of}} simultaneous collision of beam particles in the experiments and the very high repetition rates of the collision events pose huge challenges. They result in extremely high particle fluxes, causing very high occupancies in the particle physics detectors operating at these machines. To reconstruct the physics events, the detectors have to make as much information as possible available on the final state particles. We discuss how timing information with a precision of around 10 ps and below can aid the reconstruction of the physics events under such challenging conditions. High energy photons {{play a crucial role in}} this context. About one third of the particle flux originating from high energy hadron collisions is detected as photons, stemming from the decays of neutral mesons. In addition, many key physics signatures under study are identified by high energy photons in the final state. They pose a particular challenge in that they can only be detected once they convert in the detector material. The particular challenge in measuring the time of arrival of a high energy photon lies in the stochastic component of the distance to the initial conversion and the size of the electromagnetic shower. They extend spatially over distances which propagation times of the initial photon and the subsequent electromagnetic shower which are large compared to the desired precision. We present studies and measurements from test beams and a cosmic muon test stand for calorimeter based timing measurements to explore the ultimate timing precision achievable for high energy photons of 10 GeV and above. We put particular focus on techniques to measure the timing with a precision of about 10 ps in association with the energy of the photon. For calorimeters utilizing <b>scintillating</b> materials and <b>light</b> guiding components, the propagation speed of the scintillation light in the calorimeter is important.

It is universally understood that, {{as if it were}} nothing more substantial than vapour floating in the sky, every emotion of a woman is bound to end in a shower. And it is very probable that had Stevie died in his bed under her despairing gaze, in her protecting arms, Mrs Verloc’s grief would have found relief in a flood of bitter and pure tears. Mrs Verloc, in common with other human beings, was provided with a fund of unconscious resignation sufficient to meet the normal manifestation of human destiny. Without “troubling her head about it,” she was aware that it “did not stand looking into very much.” But the lamentable circumstances of Stevie’s end, which to Mr Verloc’s mind had only an episodic character, as part of a greater disaster, dried her tears at their very source. It was the effect of a white-hot iron drawn across her eyes; at the same time her heart, hardened and chilled into a lump of ice, kept her body in an inward shudder, set her features into a frozen contemplative immobility addressed to a whitewashed wall with no writing on it. The exigencies of Mrs Verloc’s temperament, which, when stripped of its philosophical reserve, was maternal and violent, forced her to roll a series of thoughts in her motionless head. These thoughts were rather imagined than expressed. Mrs Verloc was a woman of singularly few words, either for public or private use. With the rage and dismay of a betrayed woman, she reviewed the tenor of her life in visions concerned mostly with Stevie’s difficult existence from its earliest days. It was a life of single purpose and of a noble unity of inspiration, like those rare lives that have left their mark on the thoughts and feelings of mankind.

And all these scenes of violence came and went accompanied by the unrefined noise of deep vociferations proceeding from a man wounded in his paternal pride, declaring himself obviously accursed since one of his kids was a “slobbering idjut and the other a wicked she-devil.” It was of her that this had been said many years ago.|$|R

Next, in the case of the IR fiber, the intensity of the IR signal was almost uniform at each temperature regardless of the tube potential range from 50 to 150 kVp. Therefore, we also demonstrated that the X-ray beam with an energy range used in diagnostic radiology does not affect the IR signals transmitted via a silver halide optical fiber...|$|E
40|$|The Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) is {{the central}} section of the hadronic {{calorimeter}} of the ATLAS experiment. It is subdivided into a large central barrel and two smaller lateral extended barrels. Each barrel consists of 64 wedges, made of iron plates and scintillating tiles. Two edges of each scintillating tile are air-coupled to wave-length shifting fibres which collect the <b>scintillating</b> <b>light</b> and transmit it to photo-multipliers. The total number of channels is about 10000. An {{essential part of the}} TileCal detector is the Data Quality (DQ) system. The DQ system is designed to check the status of the electronic channels. It is designed to provide information at two levels - online and offline. The online TileCal DQ system monitors continuously the data while they are recorded and provides a fast feedback. The offline DQ system allows a detailed study, if needed it provides corrections to be applied to the recorded data and it allows to validate the data for physics analysis. In addition to the check of physics data the TileCal DQ systems also operate with calibration data. The TileCal calibration system provides well defined signals and the response to the calibration signals allows checking the behaviour of the electronic channels in detail. The Monitoring and Calibration Web System supports data quality analyses at the level of channels. All online, offline and calibration versions of the TileCal DQ system also provide automatic tests, the results of which allow fast and robust feedback...|$|E
40|$|Detection of {{ionizing}} radiation {{is an issue}} which affects many areas of a human life. Significant progress in detection capabilities {{was caused by the}} development of electronics in recent decades. This dissertation thesis, which deals with the design of the Multi-coincidence system of {{ionizing radiation}} detectors, follows this trend. The Multi-coincidence system of ionizing radiation detectors combines extraordinary technologies and due to using advanced electronics allows them to operate in a synchronous mode that brings new possibilities in radiation environment investigation, such as incoming direction or separation of particle types in a mixed radiation field. This dissertation thesis summarizes the development from the basic design, through hardware, firmware and software for user control as well as basic data processing. The functionality of the design is verified on a prototype and demonstrated by measurements whose results are also presented. The design is based on “sandwich” structure composed of two detection parts in closed geometry – a silicon pixel detector Timepix and a plastic scintillator covered by silicon photomultipliers. The pixel detector Timepix is a device with excellent parameters and unrivaled ability of detection and recognition of different types of radiation. The disadvantage is the detection material itself which does not allow to effectively detect certain types of radiation, such as neutrons. This is the domain of scintillation detectors. Recent optical sensors called silicon photomultipliers offers possibility for detecting of the <b>scintillating</b> <b>light</b> by small-size device. The Multi-coincidence system is a compact portable detection unit which can be used in applications where small dimensions are a significant requirement. Furthermore, it is insensitive to a magnetic field. Utilization of the system can be found in different areas from searching of radiation threats, through dosimetry to space weather monitoring.

40|$|The FAST detector, {{installed}} on the beam line of the antiproton decelerator at CERN {{in the framework of}} the ASACUSA Collaboration, is dedicated to the measurement of the annihilation cross-section of slow antiprotons (with an energy below 5 MeV, corresponding to a momentum of 100 MeV/c) in solid and gaseous targets. The goal of the detector is to reconstruct the tracks of the charged pions generated in the annihilation to identify and count the annihilation vertices. The detector has a cylindrical geometry and is made of 2 axial fiber layers and 4 stereo fiber layers. More than 10 km of BCF- 10 fibers by Bicron with a 1 mm diameter and a 70 cm length have been used. To obtain a high efficiency reducing the dead areas each fiber layer is made of two staggered half layers, in a doublet ribbon configuration. The <b>scintillating</b> <b>light</b> is detected by 42 multianode photomultipliers (HAMAMATSU H 7546) with 64 channels each; given that 4 fibers are readout by a single PMT anode, the total nuber of electronic channels is similar to 2500. The signals from the PMTS are amplified, shaped and discriminated by a pair of ASICs (VA 64 TAP 2. 1 and LS 64 - 2 from IDEAS) and then sent to a FPGA (Altera Cyclone 11) that performs a 640 MHz digital sampling, allowing to measure the arrival time of the signal of each hit fiber in a 800 ns time window, as requested by the time structure of the antiproton decelerator beam. This paper describes the detector and its electronics, reports the results of the cosmic-ray run during the commissioning phase and the preliminary results of the 2007 data taking at the antiproton decelerator...|$|E
