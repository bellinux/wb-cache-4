5000|$|... "Gitaï {{wants this}} {{house to be}} both a symbol and {{something}} very concrete; he wants it to become {{a character in a}} film. He achieves {{one of the most beautiful}} things a camera can register 'live', as it were; people who look at the same thing but see different things - and who are moved by that vision. In this crumbling <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>house,</b> real hallucinations begin to take shape. The film's central idea is simple and the film has simply the force of that idea, no more, no less." [...] (Serge Daney, Libération, March 1, 1982) ...|$|E

5000|$|Scuffle Hill is a {{historic}} home located at Martinsville, Virginia. It was built between 1917 and 1920, and it occupies the <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> earlier <b>house,</b> built in 1905, which was gutted by fire in 1917. It is a two-story, brick mansion with a gable roof with dormers, two-story polygonal window bays, a poured concrete foundation, and granite belt courses. The front facade features a Doric order portico in the Colonial Revival style. The original house was built by tobacco magnate Col. Pannill Rucker and rebuilt and later owned by the Rives Brown family, and subsequently by the Pannill family, owner of Pannill Knitting. The home later became the parish house of Christ Episcopal Church. The home is named for the first plantation in Henry County, Virginia of Revolutionary War hero General Joseph Martin, who called his first acreage [...] "Scuffle Hill," [...] as {{he said he had}} to scuffle {{to come up with the}} money for it.|$|R
60|$|We {{will not}} follow {{him in his}} triumphant {{progress}} step by step. Suffice it that Peter worked like a steam-engine and finished in that one winter the job which all the former inhabitants of the house, with time and the elements to aid them, had only half done in a century. Except the kitchen, every room and chamber was now gutted. The house was nothing but <b>a</b> <b>shell,</b> the apparition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>house,</b> as unreal as the painted edifices <b>of</b> <b>a</b> theatre. It was like the perfect rind <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great cheese in which a mouse had dwelt and nibbled till it was a cheese no more. And Peter was the mouse.|$|R
5000|$|Penicuik House (alternative spellings: Penycuik, Pennycuik) survives as the <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{formerly}} grand estate {{house in}} Penicuik, Midlothian, Scotland.

It was destroyed by fire in 1899 and a major restoration was completed in 2014 by G Brown Stonemasons.|$|R
50|$|In anatomy, an apex (adjectival form: apical) is part <b>of</b> the <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mollusk. The apex is {{the pointed}} tip (the oldest part) <b>of</b> the <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gastropod, scaphopod, or cephalopod.|$|R
50|$|The beak is part <b>of</b> the <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bivalve mollusk, i.e. part <b>of</b> the <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{saltwater}} or freshwater clam. The beak is the basal {{projection of}} the oldest part of the valve of the adult animal. The beak usually, but not always, coincides with the umbo, the highest and most prominent point on the valve. Because by definition, all bivalves have two valves, the <b>shell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bivalve has two umbones, and two beaks.|$|R
