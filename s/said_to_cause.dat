5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{believe that}} Shashthi's roots {{can be traced}} to Hindu folk traditions. References to this goddess appear in Hindu scriptures as early as 8th and 9th century BCE, in which she is associated with children as well as the Hindu war-god Skanda. Early references consider her a foster-mother of Skanda, but in later texts she is identified with Skanda's consort, Devasena. In some early texts where Shashthi appears as an attendant of Skanda, she is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> diseases in the mother and child, and thus needed to be propitiated on the sixth day after childbirth. However, over time, this malignant goddess became seen as the benevolent saviour and bestower of children.|$|E

25|$|While {{differences}} between sets of rules may have moderate strategic consequences on occasion, {{they do not}} change {{the character of the}} game. The different sets of rules usually lead to the same game result, so long as the players make minor adjustments {{near the end of the}} game.

25|$|Some learned {{men have}} thought they {{discovered}} some vestiges of vampirism in the remotest antiquity; {{but all that}} they say of it does not come near what is related of the vampires. The lamiæ, the strigæ, the sorcerers whom they accused of sucking the blood of living persons, and of thus causing their death, the magicians who were <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> the death of new-born children by charms and malignant spells, are nothing less than what we understand {{by the name of}} vampires; even were it to be owned that these lamiæ and strigæ have really existed, which we do not believe can ever be well proved.|$|E
25|$|Chief {{among these}} is the Ninth Circuit's unique rules {{concerning}} the composition of an en banc court. In other circuits, en banc courts are composed of all active circuit judges, plus (depending on {{the rules of the}} particular court) any senior judges {{who took part in the}} original panel decision. By contrast, in the Ninth Circuit it is impractical for 29 or more judges to take part in a single oral argument and deliberate on a decision en masse. The court thus provides for a “limited en banc review of a randomly selected 11 judge panel. This means that en banc reviews may not actually reflect the views of the majority of the court and indeed may not include any of the three judges involved in the decision being reviewed in the first place. The result, according to detractors, is a high risk of intracircuit conflicts of law where different groupings of judges end up delivering contradictory opinions. That is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> uncertainty in the district courts and within the bar. However, en banc review is a relatively rare occurrence in all circuits and Ninth Circuit rules provide for full en banc review in limited circumstances.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} Peter Watts makes {{mention of}} the origin of the name of Chernobyl, a city in Ukraine that was the location of the Chernobyl disaster, a 1986 nuclear meltdown. According to Watts, the name [...] "Chernobyl" [...] translates as [...] "wormwood", causing the disaster to be likened to the Biblical star of Wormwood prophesied in the Book of Revelation, which was <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> death through poisoning the waters. However, the word [...] "chernobyl" [...] can be translated as [...] "black grass" [...] or [...] "black myth". Actor Brian Downey, who portrayed a medical examiner in the episode, later appeared in an unrelated role in the two-part second season episodes [...] "Owls" [...] and [...] "Roosters".|$|E

2500|$|After his {{accident}} and {{the closure of}} the WBF, Luger joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Bobby [...] "The Brain" [...] Heenan [...] "unveiled" [...] him with the persona of [...] "Narcissus" [...] at Royal Rumble 1993. Shortly thereafter, his name was altered slightly to [...] "The Narcissist". Luger posed before full-length mirrors before every match. The WWF also incorporated his motorcycle accident into his gimmick, capitalizing on {{the fact that he had}} a [...] "metal plate" [...] inserted into his forearm which was <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> more damage when it struck an opponent, often allowing Luger to pin them with only his pinky finger placed on their chest. This caused a number of his opponents to demand that he wear a cover over it during matches when he had a streak of knocking people out. This eventually led to WWF officials demanding that Luger wear an elbow pad, though he would often remove it. The Narcissist's one major feud was with Mr. Perfect. The feud was based on Heenan, his advisor, referring to him as being [...] "Beyond Perfection," [...] in a slight at Mr. Perfect, his former managerial client. The rivalry ended at WrestleMania IX when Luger defeated Perfect.|$|E
6000|$|The chateau {{has since}} been razed, and a {{pavilion}} erected in its place, which has been presented to the Comtesse de ----, a lady who, reversing the ordinary lot of courtiers, is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> majesty {{to live in the}} sunshine of her smiles. What an appropriate and encouraging monument to rear on the birth-place of French liberty! At the opposite extremity of the village is another considerable house, that was once the dwelling of M. Necker, and is now the property and country residence of M. Ternaux, or the Baron Ternaux, if it were polite to style him thus, the most celebrated manufacturer of France. I say polite, for the mere fanfaronnade of nobility is little in vogue here. The wags tell a story of some one, who was formally announced as [...] "Monsieur le Marquis d'un tel," [...] turning short round on the servant, and exclaiming with indignation, [...] "Marquis toi-même!" [...] But this story savours of the Bonapartists; for as the Emperor created neither marquis nor vicomtes, there was a sort of affectation of assuming these titles at the restoration as proofs of belonging to the old régime.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the other}} side, however, are {{phenomena}} not automatic, 'spiritual' lights, and sounds; interferences with natural laws, as when bodies are lifted in the air, or are elongated, when fire does not fasten on them, and so on. These phenomena, in ancient times, followed {{on the performance}} of certain mystic rites. They are now said to occur without the aid of any such rites. Gods and spirits are <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> them, but they are only attained in the presence of certain exceptional persons, mediums, saints, priests, conjurers. Clearly then, not the rites, but the peculiar constitution of these individuals is the cause (setting imposture aside) of the phenomena, of the hallucinations, of the impressions, or whatever they are to be styled. That is to say, witnesses, in other matters credible, aver that they receive these peculiar impressions in the society of certain persons and not in that of people in general. Now these impressions are, everywhere, in every age and stage of civilisation, essentially identical. Is it stretching probability almost beyond what it will bear, to allege that all the phenomena, in the Arctic circle as in Australia, in ancient Alexandria as in modern London, are, always, the result of an imposture modelled on savage ideas of the supernatural? ...|$|E

60|$|According to {{the theory}} in question, Mind, or to speak move precisely, Will, is the only cause of phenomena. The type of Causation, {{as well as the}} {{exclusive}} source from which we derive the idea, is our own voluntary agency. Here, and here only (it is said), we have direct evidence of causation. We know that we can move our bodies. Respecting the phenomena of inanimate nature, we have no other direct knowledge than that of antecedence and sequence. But in the case of our voluntary actions, it is affirmed that we are conscious of power before we have experience of results. An act of volition, whether followed by an effect or not, is accompanied by a consciousness of effort, “of force exerted, of power in action, which is necessarily causal, or causative.” This feeling of energy or force, inherent in an act of will, is knowledge a priori; assurance, prior to experience, that we have the power of causing effects. Volition, therefore, it is asserted, is something more than an unconditional antecedent; it is a cause, in a different sense from that in which physical phenomena are <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> one another: it is an Efficient Cause. From this the transition is easy to the further doctrine, that Volition is the sole Efficient Cause of all phenomena. “It is inconceivable that dead force could continue unsupported for a moment beyond its creation. We can not even conceive of change or phenomena without the energy of a mind.” “The word action” itself, says another writer of the same school, “has no real significance except when applied to the doings of an intelligent agent. Let any one conceive, if he can, of any power, energy, or force inherent in a lump of matter.” Phenomena may have the semblance of being produced by physical causes, but they are in reality produced, say these writers, by the immediate agency of mind. All things which do not proceed from a human (or, I suppose, an animal) will proceed, they say, directly from divine will. The earth is not moved by the combination of a centripetal and a projectile force; this is but a mode of speaking, which serves to facilitate our conceptions. It is moved by the direct volition of an omnipotent Being, in a path coinciding with that which we deduce from the hypothesis of these two forces.|$|E
60|$|The meaning {{was evident}} enough, but we sought {{something}} further of the druggist at the corner, who {{did his best}} for us in such English as he had. It was not quite the English of Ronda; but he praised his grammar while he owned that his vocabulary was in decay from want of practise. In fact, he well-nigh committed us to the purchase {{of one of those}} votive candles, which he understood we wished to buy; he all but sent to the sacristan to get one. There were several onlookers, as there always are in Latin pharmacies, and there was a sad young mother waiting for medicine with a sick baby in her arms. The druggist said it had fever of the stomach; he seemed proud of the fact, and some talk passed between him and the bystanders which related to it. We asked if he had any of the quince jelly which we had learned to like in Seville, but he could only refer us to the confectioner's on the other corner. Here was not indeed quince jelly, but we compromised on quince cheese, as the English call it; and we bought several boxes of it to take to America, which I am sorry to say moulded before our voyage began, and had to be thrown away. Near this confectioner's was a booth where boiled sweet-potatoes were sold, with oranges and joints of sugar-cane, and, spitted on straws, that terrible fruit of the strawberry tree which we had tasted at Honda without wishing to taste it ever again. Yet there was a boy boldly buying several straws of it and chancing the intoxication which over-indulgence in it is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause.</b> Whether the excitement of these events was too great or not, we found ourselves suddenly unwilling, if not unable, to walk back to our hotel, and we took a cab of the three standing in the plaza. One was without a horse, another without a driver, but the third had both, as in some sort of riddle, and we had no sooner taken it than a horse was put into the first and a driver ran out and got on the box of the second, as if that was the answer to the riddle.|$|E
