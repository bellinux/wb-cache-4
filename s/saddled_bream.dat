The <b>saddled</b> <b>bream,,</b> sampled from populations aggregated around the Adriatic fish farm and from natural/control populations, were analysed for differences in eleven blood biochemistry parameters and liver histomorphology. The levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) and urea (URE) in cage-associated <b>saddled</b> <b>bream</b> (428. 00 ± SD 321. 56 U/L, 86. 13 ± SD 39. 87 U/L and 0. 05 ± SD 0. 16 mmol/L, respectively) were significantly lower than those observed in the control specimens (1047. 06 ± SD 505. 56 U/L, 125. 75 ± SD 34. 70 U/L and 1. 99 ± SD 0. 73 mmol/L, respectively). In contrast to that, concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in cage-associated fish (87. 63 ± SD 132. 34 U/L) were higher than values noted for the control population (6. 55 ± SD 5. 90 U/L). URE and AST presented the main variables contributing to the discrimination between two analysed populations. One-way ANOSIM based on the blood parameters showed significant difference between <b>saddled</b> <b>bream</b> that fed around cages and those from the remote waters (= 0. 697; < 0. 01). Hepatocytes of cage-associated fish contained large cytoplasmatic clear spaces indicating excessive accumulation of fat in the hepatocyte cytoplasm. All observed differences can be attributed to contrasting feeding behaviour of sampled populations but basic nutritional differences between them should be quantified in the future. Moreover, further research is necessary to detect their impact on the health status of the fish...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of oocyte size and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue (LHRHa) on ovulatory success in artificial fertilization. Vitellogenic females with maximum oocyte diameters 400 - 550 µm were repeatedly injected with LHRHa (20 µg kg- 1 per injection). Fish with maximum oocyte diameters 500 µm spawned within 48 - 54 h. These results demonstrate that injected LHRHa is effective for ovulation of <b>saddled</b> <b>bream</b> with maximum oocyte diameters > 500 µm...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} eight new microsatellite markers for the <b>saddled</b> <b>bream</b> (Oblada melanura) from an enriched genome library protocol. All these loci are polymorphic, with mean allelic diversity of 14. 75 (range 3 - 22), and expected and observed heterozygosities from 0. 233 to 0. 918 and 0. 212 to 0. 913, respectively. Cross-species tests in two close {{relatives of the}} genus Diplodus (D. sargus and D. vulgaris) revealed successful amplifications at 6 out of 8 loci, with means allele number of 6. 67 (range 4 - 10) and 6. 50 (range 4 - 10), respectively. These {{results are consistent with}} the close phylogenetic relationships between the three species, indicating this set of primers might proved useful for studying the levels of genetic diversity and population differentiation in these three species and in other phylogenetically close species of the genus Diplodus and Sparus. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

50|$|Haliakmon {{contains}} 33 {{kinds of}} fish. These include brown trout, gilt-head bream, sardine, carp, pike, eel, european anchovy, nursehound, bogue, garfish, red porgy, <b>saddled</b> seabream, angler, <b>bream,</b> mediterranean sand smelt, sand steenbras, mullus barbatus, freshwater bass, tuna, salmon, Mediterranean moray, weever, longfin gurnard, dogfish, dusky grouper, school shark and turbot. About 30 {{of them are}} indigenous, while the rest were introduced by human intervention. Many of them are considered scarce and one, mavrotsironi, lives nowhere else in the world, i.e. it is endemic. Μost {{of these kinds of}} fish have no commercial value but only biological, since they support the food web. Fish found in Haliakmon, like carp and rainbow trout, indicate that its water is still pure. Some eels are found in its estuaries, that cannot migrate, hindered by the dams.|$|R
40|$|Spawning of the Mediterranean {{dusky grouper}} Epinephelus marginatus (Lowe, 1834) was {{observed}} {{for the first}} time in summer 1996 during scuba diving surveys in the Medes Islands Marine Reserve (NW Mediterranean). Ten spawning events were observed, which occurred at sunset, in the evenings around the new moon of August. A mature female (usually between 50 and 75 cm TL), in the standard mottled colour pattern, and a larger (more than 100 cm long) dominant male, in a conspicuous silver streaked colour-pattern, ascended up to 12 m side by side, spiralling in an anti-clockwise direction two or three times, from the bottom to shallow warmer waters, where the ova and sperm are released. Some traits of variability over this common pattern of spawning are described. Predation by <b>saddled</b> <b>bream</b> Oblada melanura, which concentrate in great numbers after each spawning suggests a very low survival of the spawned eggs...|$|E
40|$|Morphology, histology, and {{immunohistochemistry}} of the adrenocortical and adrenomedullary homologs (adrenal glands) of {{the following}} developing and adult teleosts were examined: Salmoniformes-Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout), Salmo trutta fario (brown trout), Coregonus lavaretus (white fish); Cyprinodontiformes-Gambusia affinis (mosquito fish). Perciformes-Dicentrarchus labrax (sea bass), Sparus aurata (sea bream), Diplodus sargus (white bream), Oblada melanura (<b>saddled</b> <b>bream).</b> The anatomical relationships of the gland with the renal system and venous vessels were also noted. in adults of all species steroidogenic and catecholaminergic chromaffin cells {{were found in the}} head kidney, which is pronephric in origin and subsequently transformed into a hematopoietic lymphatic organ. In Perciformes, chromaffin cells are distributed around the anterior and posterior cardinal veins and ducts of Cuvier; in Salmoniformes, around the posterior cardinal veins and in the hematopoietic tissue; and in G. affinis, around the ducts of Cuvier and posterior cardinal veins, while a few are visible also around the sinus venosus. in Perciformes and Salmoniformes, numerous chromaffin cells are also present in the posterior kidney, derived from the opisthonephros, in contact with the caudal vein. Steroidogenic cells are always confined to the head kidney. During development chromaffin and steroidogenic cells appear early after hatching in the pronephric kidney, {{at the level of the}} ducts of Cuvier and of the cephalic part of the posterior cardinal veins. Later, chromaffin cells in Perciformes reach the anterior cardinal veins, and subsequently, in both Perciformes and Salmoniformes, they reach the developing posterior kidney. Their localization along the posterior kidney is still in progress about 4 months after hatching and is completed about a year after hatching. These findings support the concept that the structure of the adrenal gland in teleosts is intermediate between that of the other actinopterygians and that of tetrapods. The development differs from that of tetrapods in that it occurs mainly in the pronephros and only later do chromaffin cells reach the opisthonephric kidney. (C) 1997 Academic Press...|$|E
