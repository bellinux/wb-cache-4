As Botvinnik was the first world-class player produced by the Soviet Union, everything he said or did (or did not <b>say</b> <b>or</b> <b>do)</b> had political repercussions, and there were rumors that Soviet opponents were given hints that they should not beat him.|$|E
25|$|The Holocaust {{has been}} {{explained}} away officially as merely {{the relocation of}} the Jewish population into areas of Eastern Europe where communications and transport networks are still very poor. Despite this, many Germans suspect the government has eliminated the Jews, but generally don't care or are too afraid of the Nazi authorities to <b>say</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> anything with this knowledge. Some surviving Jews escaped to Soviet territory, where they have provided testimony of the extermination efforts - while Nazi authorities decry this as Bolshevik propaganda, the outside world {{is aware of the}} Holocaust. The American president, however, remains neutral so as not to further damage relations, and refers only to vague 'human rights violations' he wishes to investigate while visiting Berlin.|$|E

"One of {{the most}} {{important}} things we were looking for in casting was the actors' ability to play the subtleties – the little things that a character doesn't <b>say</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> that create the edge, the things that get under your skin and spook you," [...] Morgan said about the auditions.|$|E

The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of [...] "Hiya", roughly translated as 'a sense of shame', and [...] "Amor propio" [...] or 'self-esteem'. Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns. Caring about what others will think, <b>say</b> <b>or</b> <b>do,</b> are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos.|$|E
500|$|The City {{was often}} criticized for {{appearing}} to fabricate {{much of its}} storyline. In one instance, Diane von Fürstenberg workers were reportedly angered that Port [...] "doesn't really work" [...] and was [...] "hardly ever in the office", elaborating that series producers would inhibit normal work operations by not allowing employees to move items in their offices. Freddie Fackelmayer, Port's former love interest, commented that the network [...] "never asked the cast to <b>say</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> anything", though the editing that followed portrayed him as a [...] "womanizing jerk".|$|E
500|$|Druckmann's writing philosophy, {{which he}} {{realized}} while talking to game designer Cory Barlog, is [...] "simple story, complex characters"; Druckmann dislikes video games with complicated exposition, but enjoys writing complex character relationships. Throughout his writing, Druckmann approaches scenes with focus on every character, attempting {{to enter the}} mindset of each individual character. He tries to ignore character tropes {{in an attempt to}} write [...] "honestly". Druckmann also writes with a minimalist mindset, often asking himself [...] "What is this scene really about? What's the least we have to <b>say</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> to convey that and no more?" ...|$|E

[...] Auerbach said, [...] "Kermit was fighting a battle he couldn't win. Nothing he could <b>say</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> {{was going to change}} the way people perceived him because of that moment. I wanted him to feel at home with us, to feel wanted." [...] Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.|$|E

BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar {{alleged that the}} Congress State government deliberately delayed taking any action when the attacks on North Indians began in Mumbai. He said that he suspected Congress had a strategy to divide Maharashtrian and non-Maharashtrian votes, by creating a feeling of insecurity among non-Maharashtrians {{in the hope that}} they would vote for the Congress. He blamed the party for trying to divert people's attention from more critical problems that Maharashtra faces, such as the agrarian crisis and load shedding. He added, [...] "India is one and every Indian has a right to settle down and work in any part of the country".|$|E
500|$|Cooper's acting style {{consisted}} of three essential characteristics: his ability to project elements of his own personality onto the characters he portrayed, to appear natural and authentic in his roles, and to underplay and deliver restrained performances calibrated for the camera and the screen. Acting teacher Lee Strasberg once observed: [...] "The simplest examples of Stanislavsky's ideas are actors such as Gary Cooper, John Wayne, and Spencer Tracy. They try not to act but to be themselves, to respond or react. They refuse to <b>say</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> anything they feel not to be consonant with their own characters." [...] Film director François Truffaut ranked Cooper among [...] "the greatest actors" [...] because {{of his ability to}} deliver great performances [...] "without direction". This ability to project elements of his own personality onto his characters produced a continuity across his performances to the extent that critics and audiences were convinced that he was simply [...] "playing himself".|$|E

500|$|Steenbergen {{was happy}} to see the {{character}} return in the fifth season, noting that the show has been missing [...] "smart, tough women who are not evil in general". Tina Charles of TV Guide also welcomed the character back, and enjoyed how Ellen's initial reaction to Dean Winchester in [...] "Good God, Y'all!"hugging and then slapping himwas [...] "very much in character". Regarding the character's death, Charles noted that [...] "when [...] went down in 'Abandon All Hope' like [...] did, I felt it. [...] meant something". Though also happy to see Ellen reappear in the fifth season, Ryan was disappointed at the lack of screentime the character received in [...] "Good God, Y'All!". Commenting on the character's farewells in the fifth season, Ryan noted that Ferris [...] "brought [...] A-game to 'Abandon All Hope…'". She added that [...] " [...] perfectly into the 'Supernatural' world because [...] that on this show, restraint is everything.

500|$|IGN's Joshua Yehl {{gave the}} fourth part of [...] "Trinity War", Justice League of America #7, a 6.5 out of 10. Yehl said, [...] "With {{nearly two dozen}} heroes filling up every ounce of panel space, the reading {{experience}} becomes stretched thin as writers Geoff Johns and Jeff Lemire try to find something for everyone to <b>say</b> <b>or</b> <b>do.</b> The result is an event comic that has two more issues to go yet still hasn’t decided exactly what this story is really about." [...] He however, enjoyed Lex Luthor's appearance in the issue. Conversely, Richard Gray of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out of 10, saying [...] "For all the false starts and misdirection of the New 52, the first major crossover in “Trinity War” has come together nicely. While {{there is still the}} pervading sense that this is merely a set-up for the next major event, the “Forever Evil” villains month, there’s no denying that it has been a hell of a ride so far," [...] adding [...] "all of the previously disparate elements from the various series begin to coalesce into something major." [...] Jim Johnson of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, feeling it was [...] "loads of fanboy fun" [...] and the issue actually progressed the series storyline, not just the event's storyline.|$|E
500|$|The character's death saddened Charles, but she {{admitted}} {{it was a}} [...] "very effective move". She described Jo's scenes with Dean in [...] "Abandon All Hope..." [...] as [...] "amazing", and added, [...] "I feel like I finally felt their connection and the kiss was pretty potent." [...] Commenting on the character's dying farewells in the fifth season, Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune noted that Tal [...] "brought [...] A-game to 'Abandon All Hope…'", declaring that [...] " [...] perfectly into the 'Supernatural' world because [...] that on this show, restraint is everything. It's not necessarily just about what the characters <b>say</b> <b>or</b> <b>do,</b> it's about what they don't saywhat they can't find the words for". Steenbergen called Jo's death [...] "one of the saddest moments in the show's history", and expressed the desire to bring Jo back permanently. Regarding the character's reappearance in [...] "Defending Your Life", Steenbergen described the scenes between Jo and Dean as [...] "compelling" [...] and [...] "the highlights of the episode". Likewise, Ryan deemed Jo's final scene with Dean in [...] "Defending Your Life" [...] "the {{best part of the}} episode", feeling that Jensen Ackles (Dean's actor) and Tal [...] "have always had nice chemistry together". However, Ryan disliked that Dean felt he was responsible for Jo's choices and ultimately her death, writing, [...] "I'm such a fan of Jo that to retroactively take away her agency and go along with the idea that Dean was her puppetmaster felt as though it would do a disservice to one of the show's (increasingly rare) cool female characters." ...|$|E

These included their contention that the Mormons had organized into a company known as the Danites, [...] "who have taken an oath to support the heads of the church in all things that they <b>say</b> <b>or</b> <b>do,</b> whether right or wrong" [...] and that Mormon and Danite vigilantes had burned and looted non-Mormon settlements in Daviess County.
