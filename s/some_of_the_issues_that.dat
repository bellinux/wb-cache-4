25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> {{learning}} {{organizations were}} designed to address within institutions is fragmentation, competition and reactiveness. Fragmentation is described as breaking a problem into pieces. For example, each organization has an accounting department, finance, operations, IT and marketing. Competition occurs when employees {{are trying to do}} better or 'beat' others in an assignment instead of collaborating. Reactiveness occurs when an organization changes only in reaction to outside forces, rather than proactively initiating change.|$|E
25|$|Bileaflet {{heart valves}} consist of two semicircular {{leaflets}} that rotate about struts {{attached to the}} valve housing. This design was introduced in 1979 and while {{they take care of}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> were seen in the other models, bileaflets are vulnerable to backflow and so they cannot be considered as ideal. Bileaflet valves do, however, provide much more natural blood flow than caged-ball or tilting-disc implants. One of the main advantages of these valves is that they are well tolerated by the body. Only a small amount of blood thinner is needed to be taken by the patient each day in order to prevent clotting of the blood when flowing through the valve.|$|E

In 2012, Falle sought to bring a lawsuit against her former pimp to demonstrate to other women who are or have been forcibly prostituted {{that it is possible}} to oppose one's pimp. In 2013, she said that, while she has left much aggression and profanity behind since leaving the sex industry, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> she developed will stick with her until the end of her life. Jonathan Migneault of the Sudbury Star wrote that [...] "Falle's story about her descent in and escape from prostitution is so horrific you almost don't believe the details." [...] Sam Pazzano of the Toronto Sun wrote that, after 12 years of prostitution, Falle still has [...] "attractive looks and [...] sharp mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|MacKay {{entered the}} first ballot of the PC {{leadership}} convention held on May 31, 2003 with roughly 41% {{of the delegates}} supporting him. [...] However, on the second ballot, MacKay's support dropped to 39%. On the third ballot, MacKay's support reached 45% but many of his supporters were convinced that he had hit his popular peak. Some analysts noted that the eliminated third-place challenger David Orchard drew his 25% bulk of delegate supporters largely from the Western prairie provinces. Orchard was prepared to speak with either MacKay or Prentice {{to determine if a}} deal could be reached over <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> he raised during the leadership campaign. [...] As the results of the third ballot were called, MacKay's campaign manager, PC Senator Noël Kinsella, hastily arranged a backroom meeting between MacKay, Orchard, and their campaign advisors. During the meeting, MacKay reached a deal with his rival, and Orchard emerged from the room urging his delegates to support MacKay. Press officials immediately demanded to know what had inspired Orchard's surprise move. Orchard repeatedly referred to a [...] "gentleman's agreement" [...] made between himself and MacKay that had led to his qualified support.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, most {{couples have}} a {{division}} of 'tasks' or 'labor', e.g., the husband mows the yard, the wife pays the bills, etc. which, in addition to dealing with great grief and life changes, means added responsibilities for the bereaved. Immediately {{after the death of}} a spouse, there are tasks that must be completed. [...] Planning and financing a funeral can be very difficult if pre-planning was not completed. [...] Changes in insurance, bank accounts, claiming of life insurance, securing childcare are just <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> can be intimidating to someone who is grieving. [...] Social isolation may also become imminent, as many groups composed of couples find it difficult to adjust to the new identity of the bereaved, and the bereaved themselves have great challenges in reconnecting with others. Widows of many cultures, for instance, wear black {{for the rest of their}} lives to signify the loss of their spouse and their grief. Only in more recent decades has this tradition been reduced to a period of two years, while some religions such as Christian Orthodox many widows will still continue to wear black for the remainder of their lives.|$|E
