5|$|Massive main {{sequence}} stars can have surface temperatures of 50,000K. Smaller <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Sun have surface temperatures {{of a few}} thousand K. Red giants have relatively low surface temperatures of about 3,600K; {{but they also have}} a high luminosity due to their large exterior surface area.|$|E

5|$|Ptolemy of Alexandria mapped {{the stars}} in BooksVII and VIII of his Almagest, in which he used Sirius as the {{location}} for the globe's central meridian.

5|$|For the 2007–08 season, Bayern made drastic squad {{changes to}} help rebuild. They signed {{a total of}} eight new players and sold, {{released}} or loaned out nine of their players. Among new signings were 2006 World Cup <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Franck Ribéry, Miroslav Klose and Luca Toni. Bayern {{went on to win}} the Bundesliga, being on top of the standings on every single week of play, and the DFB-Pokal against Borussia Dortmund.|$|E
5|$|Mass loss {{is one of}} {{the most}} intensively studied aspects of massive star research. Put simply, using {{observed}} mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution does not reproduce the observed properties of evolved massive <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Wolf–Rayets, the number and types of core collapse supernovae, or their progenitors. To match those observations, the models require much higher mass loss rates. Eta Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates, currently around /year, and is an obvious candidate for study.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though the}} Star product {{failed in the}} market, it raised {{expectations}} and laid important groundwork for later computers. Many of the innovations behind the <b>Star,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> WYSIWYG editing, Ethernet, and network services <b>such</b> <b>as</b> directory, print, file, and internetwork routing have become commonplace in computers of today.|$|R
50|$|Exoplanets {{that are}} {{extremely}} {{close to their}} <b>star,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> hot Jupiters can experience significant hydrodynamic escape {{to the point that}} they cease to be gas giants and are left with just the core, at which point they would be called Chthonian planets.|$|R

5|$|Storhamar Ishall is {{the regular}} {{training}} venue for Storhamar IL's figure skating group. Between them, the two venues have hosted the Norwegian Figure Skating Championships three times: Storhamar Ishall in 1983, and the Olympic Amphitheatre in 2005 and 2011. In October 1993, the Olympic Amphitheatre hosted Piruetten 1993, a pre-Olympic figure skating event. Although featuring <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Nancy Kerrigan, it only attracted 150 spectators. The venue has hosted the ISU Junior Grand Prix in 1999–2000 and 2000–01 and the World Junior Figure Skating Championships in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{differential}} rotation is observed on <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Sun when the angular velocity varies with latitude. Typically the angular velocity decreases with increasing latitude. However the reverse {{has also been}} observed, such as on the star designated HD31993. The first such star, other than the Sun, to have its {{differential rotation}} mapped in detail is AB Doradus.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite {{is the case for}} degenerate, compact <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} {{rules of}} thumb {{are useful for}} situations approximated by classical mechanics under the standard assumptions of astrodynamics outlined below the rules. [...] The specific example discussed is of a satellite orbiting a planet, but the rules of thumb could also apply to other situations, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> orbits of small bodies around a <b>star</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Sun.|$|R
25|$|In 1963, comedy films became {{to feature}} in Argentine cinema, and films <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Alias Flequillo in 1963 {{directed}} by Julio Saraceni <b>starred</b> comedians <b>such</b> <b>as</b> José Marrone. Las Aventuras del Capitán Piluso en el Castillo del Terror <b>starred</b> comedians <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Alberto Olmedo {{who appeared in}} the genre throughout the 1960s and 1970s appearing in 1967's El andador and other slap-stick comedies.|$|R
5|$|A young <b>star</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Epsilon Eridani {{can produce}} {{large amounts of}} {{ultraviolet}} radiation that may be harmful to life. The orbital radius where the UV flux matches that on the early Earth lies at just under 0.5AU. Epsilon Eridani's proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets have made it a destination for interstellar travel in science fiction stories.|$|R
5|$|The {{science of}} stellar {{spectroscopy}} was pioneered by Joseph von Fraunhofer and Angelo Secchi. By comparing the spectra of <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Sirius to the Sun, they found {{differences in the}} strength and number of their absorption lines—the dark lines in a stellar spectra caused by the atmosphere's absorption of specific frequencies. In 1865 Secchi began classifying stars into spectral types. However, the modern version of the stellar classification scheme was developed by Annie J. Cannon during the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} amount of new star formation and star destruction data {{is expected to be}} recorded from continued observation of Sakurai's Object, as well as be used as reference data in the future research of similar stars. The reason that <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae exist, as well as experience a shorter lifespan compared to most stars, is largely unknown. Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae have been observed experiencing born-again behavior for only 10 years, while FG Sagittae has undergone such behavior for 120 years. It is hypothesized that this is due to Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae evolving to the asymptotic giant branch of stars for the first time, while FG Sagittae is undergoing the process a second time.|$|E
5|$|Eaton made a {{one night}} only {{appearance}} for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on August 13, 2003, {{as a part}} of a Kid Kash storyline where Kash faced off against a series of 1980s wrestling <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Larry Zbyszko and Ricky Morton. Eaton lost to Kid Kash in his only TNA appearance to date. On October 23, 2015, Eaton wrestled his last match of his nearly 40-year career, losing to Ricky Morton, also ending the 30-plus year feud between The Rock 'n' Roll Express and The Midnight Express.|$|E

5|$|Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry {{were among}} the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival {{to become one of}} America's most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the {{development}} of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American pop <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities, as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, and Beyoncé as well as hip hop artists Jay-Z, Eminem and Kanye West. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.|$|E
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} have a {{very high}} star density, and therefore close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of <b>stars,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, are much more common in globular clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly {{as a result of an}} encounter with a binary system. The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed at the beginning of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} normally {{consist of}} Population II stars, {{which have a}} low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to Population I <b>stars</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Sun. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to the proportions of these elements as the metallicity. These elements are produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and then are recycled into the interstellar medium, where they enter {{the next generation of}} stars. Hence the proportion of metals can be an indication of the age of a star, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.|$|E

5000|$|A model {{spectrum}} is an artificial spectrum {{of a star}} made by recreating the absorption or emission features seen in the spectrum.
