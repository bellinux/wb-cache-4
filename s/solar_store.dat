40|$|In the {{framework}} of the REBUS project (Competitive Solar Heating Systems for Residential Buildings) a new concept of solar combisystem was developed. The system consisted of two units, the Technical Unit and the <b>Solar</b> <b>Store</b> Unit. The <b>Solar</b> <b>Store</b> Unit in principle is a buffer tank filled with space heating water, which needs 5 connections at the right heights for charging and discharging. For this <b>Solar</b> <b>Store</b> Unit in principle any simple available tank can be used because all operational devices are integrated in the Technical Unit. The proposed standard tank has a volume of 300 lt and it is integrated in a 60 x 60 cm cabinet with a nice casing, which is perfect for aesthetical integration. The standard tank is insulated with PUR-foam, which is filled between the tank with a diameter of 500 mm and the 60 x 60 cm cabinet. In order to improve the performance of the solar combisystem, keeping the solar tank into the 60 x 60 cabinet a new combined insulation concept was used, which enabled to increase the diameter of the tank; using a 20 mm thick vacuum panels, which are integrated into the PUR foam, allowed to increase the diameter of the tank by 10 % (550 mm instead of 500 mm), which increased the volume by 20 %, from 300 lt to 360 lt. In this paper are presented detailed investigations on the heat loss coefficients of the two tanks measured from laboratory tests and a comparative system analysis using the two different tanks...|$|E
40|$|Small-scale {{solar thermal}} {{cogeneration}} shows promise {{as an effective}} way to get increased benefit out of a given solar availability, since it does not waste potential during summer after the water capacity is heated. In this paper a scroll expander is tested in a small organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and used to calibrate a static expander model. Validation of the scroll expander model shows agreement generally within 10 % for the shaft power, 5 % for the rotational speed and 6 K for the exhaust temperature, with some outliers at very low pressure ratios. This calibrated model is then incorporated into a larger dynamic model of a solar thermal cogeneration system, designed for some larger dwelling unit or small commercial establishment that requires a larger volume of hot water. An annual simulation is conducted using a collector area of 50 m 2, and the scroll expander shows a maximum isentropic efficiency of 59 % while the ORC efficiency is 3. 47 %. The total energy produced is 1710 kWh and the hot water available is on average 2540 L/day. The maximum instantaneous power that can be produced by the system is 676 W, and it is possible to shift the time period that the system is producing power to match the peak demand period by adjusting the <b>solar</b> <b>store</b> volume...|$|E

40|$|A simple, {{low-cost}} solar {{water heater}} has been developed for operation in Mediterranean Europe or regions of similar latitude (40 - 45 Â° north). It {{takes the form of}} a trapezoidal-shaped water store in direct contact with an inclined flat-plate solar collector assembly. This cross-section induces thermal stratification in the water store, and provides sufficient energy storage to meet typical daily hot-water demand. Its thermal performance is critically dependent on the waterside convective heat-transfer coefficient on the backward-reclining collector plate; previously evaluated by Cruz et al. (Cruz JMS, Hammond GP, Reis AJPS. Buoyancy-driven convective heat exchange in a trapezoidal-shaped <b>solar</b> collector/thermal <b>store.</b> In: Proc. of the 5 th ASME/JSME Joint Thermal Engineering Conf., San Diego, CA (ASME, New York), 1999, 9 pp). In the current design, the absorber plate inclination to the horizontal was fixed at 45 Â° (close to the local latitude) in order to yield maximum solar gain over a typical year. The energy saving provided by the <b>solar</b> collector/thermal <b>store</b> demonstrator largely depends on the amount of thermal stratification within the trapezoidal storage cavity. This was evaluated via both computation and measurements of the temperature field. A thermal network analysis model was then used to assess the energy-saving potential of the composite system. It indicated that a 30 - 70 % reduction in daily load could be obtained in contrast to direct, electrical or gas, heating: the smaller saving occurred at times of greatest use or hot-water take-off.
