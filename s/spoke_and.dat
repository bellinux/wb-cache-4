5|$|After leaving {{elementary}} school in 1893, Kafka {{was admitted to the}} rigorous classics-oriented state gymnasium, , an academic secondary school at Old Town Square, within the Kinský Palace. German was the language of instruction, but Kafka also <b>spoke</b> <b>and</b> wrote in Czech. He studied the latter at the gymnasium for eight years, achieving good grades. Although Kafka received compliments for his Czech, he never considered himself fluent in Czech, though he spoke German with a Czech accent. He completed his Matura exams in 1901.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 10 Władysław {{received}} his own prince court. Władysław formed a friendship with Adam Kazanowski and his brother, Stanisław. It is reported that young Władysław was interested in arts; later this led to him becoming an important patron of arts. He <b>spoke</b> <b>and</b> wrote in German, Italian and Latin. Władysław was liked by the szlachta (Polish nobility), but his father's plans to secure him the throne of Poland (vivente rege) were unpopular and eventually crushed in the Zebrzydowski Rebellion (rokosz).|$|E
5|$|George was {{ridiculed}} by his British subjects; {{some of his}} contemporaries, such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, {{thought him}} unintelligent {{on the grounds that}} he was wooden in public. Though he was unpopular in Great Britain due to his supposed inability to speak English, such an inability may not have existed later in his reign as documents from that time show that he understood, <b>spoke</b> <b>and</b> wrote English. He certainly spoke fluent German and French, good Latin, and some Italian and Dutch. His treatment of his wife, Sophia Dorothea, became something of a scandal.|$|E

50|$|The first bicycle wheels {{followed}} {{the traditions of}} carriage building: a wooden hub, a fixed steel axle (the bearings were located in the fork ends), wooden <b>spokes</b> <b>and</b> a shrink fitted iron tire.

5|$|Harding <b>spoke</b> <b>and</b> {{voted in}} favor of the {{resolution}} of war requested by Wilson in April 1917 that plunged the United States into World War I. In August, Harding argued for giving Wilson almost dictatorial powers, stating that democracy had little place in time of war. Harding voted for most war legislation, including the Espionage Act of 1917, which restricted civil liberties, though he opposed the excess profits tax as anti-business. In May 1918, Harding, less enthusiastic about Wilson, opposed a bill to expand the president's powers.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days later}} Edwards likely killed Günter Steinhausen, {{a friend of}} Marseille. The next day, 7 September 1942, another close friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt was posted missing in action. These {{personal}} losses weighed heavily on Marseille's mind along with his family tragedy. It was noted he barely <b>spoke</b> <b>and</b> became more morose in the last weeks of his life. The strain of combat also induced consistent sleepwalking at night and other symptoms that {{could be construed as}} posttraumatic stress disorder. Marseille never remembered these events.|$|E
5|$|Rising electoral {{success was}} {{accompanied}} by factional in-fighting, with a leadership contest emerging in the ASP between the incumbent Alejo Véliz and Morales, who had the electoral backing of the social movement's bases. The conflict led to a schism, with Morales and his supporters splitting to form their own party, the Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (Instrumento Político por la Soberanía de los Pueblos – IPSP). The movement's bases defected en masse to the IPSP, leaving the ASP to crumble and Véliz to join the centre-right New Republican Force (Nueva Fuerza Republicana – NFR), for which Morales denounced him as a traitor to the cocalero cause. Continuing his activism, in 1998 Morales led another cocalero march from El Chapare to la Paz, and came under increasing criticism from the government, who repeatedly {{accused him of being}} involved in the cocaine trade and mocked him for how he <b>spoke</b> <b>and</b> his lack of education.|$|E

5|$|The {{last half}} of the century's first decade was a time of sorrow, {{loneliness}} and constant work for Pankhurst. In 1907 she sold her home in Manchester and began an itinerant lifestyle, moving from place to place as she <b>spoke</b> <b>and</b> marched for women's suffrage. She stayed with friends and in hotels, carrying her few possessions in suitcases. Although she was energised by the struggle–and found joy in giving energy to others– her constant travelling meant separation from her children, especially Christabel, who had become the national coordinator of the WSPU. In 1909, as Pankhurst planned a speaking tour of the United States, Harry was paralysed after his spinal cord became inflamed. She hesitated to leave the country while he was ill, but she needed money to pay for his treatment and the tour promised to be lucrative. On her return from a successful tour, she sat by Harry's bedside as he died on 5 January 1910. Five days later she buried her son, then spoke before 5,000 people in Manchester. Liberal Party supporters who had come to heckle her remained quiet as she addressed the crowd.|$|E
25|$|Buckminster Fuller <b>spoke</b> <b>and</b> {{wrote in}} a unique style {{and said it was}} {{important}} to describe the world as accurately as possible. Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative) as well as terms he himself invented.|$|E

25|$|Carathéodory {{excelled at}} languages, much like {{many members of}} his family did. Greek and French were his first languages, and he {{mastered}} German with such perfection, that his writings composed in the German language are stylistic masterworks. Carathéodory also <b>spoke</b> <b>and</b> wrote English, Italian, Turkish, and the ancient languages without any effort. Such an impressive linguistic arsenal enabled him to communicate and exchange ideas directly with other mathematicians during his numerous travels, and greatly extend his fields of knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Spurgeon was a {{prolific}} {{author of many}} types of works including sermons, an autobiography, commentaries, books on prayer, devotionals, magazines, poetry, hymns, and more. Many sermons were transcribed as he <b>spoke</b> <b>and</b> were translated into many languages during his lifetime. Spurgeon produced powerful sermons of penetrating thought and precise exposition. His oratory skills held his listeners spellbound in the Metropolitan Tabernacle and many Christians hold his writings in exceptionally high regard among devotional literature.|$|E

The intersections of the spokes with the wheel are safe zones.|$|R
25|$|The {{candidates}} presented differing {{opinions of}} President George W.

The candidates also presented different opinions on contentious issues such as abortion and stem-cell research but were united in calling for further tax cuts. All candidates opposed a pullout from Iraq except for Ron Paul, who <b>spoke</b> <b>and</b> voted against the resolution to authorize war on Iraq in 2002 {{and has been a}} vocal critic of the war.|$|E
25|$|Because of his asthma, Nabors {{moved to}} Los Angeles {{and worked as}} a film cutter for NBC. He also worked at a Santa Monica tavern, The Horn, singing and acting in cabaret theater. His act {{featured}} him as a character similar to the Gomer Pyle character he later portrayed. He sang in a baritone and sometimes <b>spoke</b> <b>and</b> sang in his higher-pitched comedic voice. At the club, comedian Bill Dana saw Nabors' act and invited him to appear on The Steve Allen Show. Nabors signed on to the show, but it was soon canceled.|$|E
25|$|Henze {{lived with}} his partner Fausto Moroni from the early sixties, and Moroni planned and planted the {{hillside}} garden around La Leprara. Moroni cared for the composer when he suffered a spectacular emotional collapse during which he barely <b>spoke</b> <b>and</b> had to be encouraged to eat, living as though in a coma. In 2007, shortly after Henze's sudden recovery, Moroni died after a lengthy battle with cancer. Elogium Musicum (2008), for large orchestra and chorus singing Henze's own Latin text, is a memorial to his partner of more than forty years.|$|E
