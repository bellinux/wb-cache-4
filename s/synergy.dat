40|$|Mergers are the {{combining}} {{of two or}} more {{firms to}} create <b>synergies.</b> These <b>synergies</b> may come from various sources such as operational <b>synergies</b> come from economies of scale or financial <b>synergies</b> come from increased value of securities of the firm. There are vast amount of studies analysing operational <b>synergies</b> of mergers. This study analyses the financial ones. This way the dynamics of purely financial <b>synergies</b> can be revealed. Purely financial <b>synergies</b> can be transformed into financial instruments such as securitization. While analysing financial <b>synergies</b> the puzzle of distribution of financial <b>synergies</b> between claimholders is investigated. Previous literature on mergers showed that bondholders may gain more than existing shareholders of the merging firms. This may become rather controversial. A merger may be synergistic but it {{does not necessarily mean that}} shareholders' wealth will increase. Managers and/or shareholders are the parties making the merger decision. If managers are acting to the best interest of shareholders then they would try to increase shareholders' wealth. To solve this problem first the dynamics of mergers were analysed and then new strategies developed and demonstrated to transfer the financial <b>synergies</b> to the shareholders.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} how sources of <b>synergies</b> within a network of Living Labs can be identified, and how these <b>synergies</b> can be managed and exploited to benefit individual Living Labs and their stakeholders and strengthen the network as a whole. The C@R Integrated Project, aiming to catalyze rural development by boosting collaborative work environments and comprising seven Living Labs serves as a case study. Main sources of <b>synergies</b> are in the Living Labs application domains, technologies, infrastructures, services, and local communities and networks. Apart from <b>synergies</b> between Living Labs, additional sources of <b>synergies</b> lie in the reuse of existing platforms, tools and services. The paper demonstrates how different types of <b>synergies</b> can be identified and exploited in various ways. A case is presented focusing on two Living Labs reusing existing services and exploiting <b>synergies</b> based on shared services and components.

40|$|Muscle <b>synergies</b> are {{hypothesized}} to reflect modular control of muscle groups via descending commands sent through multiple neural pathways. Recently, {{the number of}} <b>synergies</b> has been reported as a functionally relevant indicator of motor control complexity in individuals with neurological movement disorders. Yet the number of <b>synergies</b> extracted during a given activity, e. g. gait, varies within and across studies, even for unimpaired individuals. With no standardized methods for precise determination, this variability remains unexplained making comparisons across studies and cohorts difficult. Here, we utilize k-means clustering and intra-class and between-level correlation coefficients to precisely discriminate reliable from unreliable <b>synergies.</b> EMG was recorded bilaterally from eight leg muscles during treadmill walking at self-selected speed. Muscle <b>synergies</b> were extracted from 20 consecutive gait cycles using non-negative matrix factorization. We demonstrate {{that the number of}} <b>synergies</b> is highly dependent on the threshold when using the variance accounted for by reconstructed EMG. In contrast, our method utilized a quantitative metric to reliably identify four or five <b>synergies</b> underpinning walking in unimpaired adults and revealed <b>synergies</b> having poor reproducibility that should not be considered as true <b>synergies.</b> We show that robust and unreliable <b>synergies</b> emerge similarly, emphasizing the need for careful analysis in those with pathology...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the properties of}} motor components, also known as <b>synergies,</b> arising from a computational theory (in the sense of Marr, 1982) or theory of optimal motor behavior. We study this topic {{in the domain of}} optimal control of a two-joint arm for reaching and via-point tasks. Studies of the motor <b>synergies</b> revealed several interesting findings. First, optimal motor actions for a new reaching or via-point movement can be generated by summing a small number of scaled and time-shifted motor <b>synergies,</b> indicating that optimal movements can be planned in a low-dimensional space by using optimal motor <b>synergies</b> as motor primitives or building blocks. Second, some optimal <b>synergies</b> are task-independent— they arise regardless of the task context—whereas other <b>synergies</b> are task-dependent—they arise in the context of one task but not in the contexts of other tasks. Biological organisms use a combination of task-independent and task-dependent <b>synergies.</b> Our work suggests that this may be an efficient combination for generating optimal motor actions from motor primitives. Lastly, optimal motor actions can be rapidly acquired by learning new linear combinations of optimal motor <b>synergies.</b> This result provides further evidence that optimal motor <b>synergies</b> are useful motor primitives...|$|R

5|$|Drug {{overdose}} and intoxication {{are significant}} causes of accidental death, {{and can also}} be used as a form of suicide. Death can occur from overdosing on a single or multiple drugs, or from combined drug intoxication (CDI) due to poly drug use. Poly drug use often carries more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug <b>synergy.</b> For example, the chance of death from overdosing on opiates is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol. While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses. Drug overdoses and intoxication can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while marijuana does not cause fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase the chance of fatal traffic collisions.|$|E

40|$|Previous studies {{indicate}} that motor coordination may be achieved by assembling task-dependent combinations of a few muscle <b>synergies,</b> defined here as fixed patterns of activation across a set of muscles. Our recent study of severely impaired chronic stroke survivors showed that some muscle <b>synergies</b> underlying isometric force generation at the hand are altered in the affected arm. However, whether similar alterations are evident in stroke survivors with lesser impairment remains unclear. Accordingly, we examined muscle <b>synergies</b> underlying spatial patterns of elbow and shoulder muscle activation recorded during an isometric force target matching protocol performed by 16 chronic stroke survivors, evenly divided across mild and moderate impairment levels. We applied non-negative matrix factorization to identify the muscle <b>synergies</b> and compared their structure across groups, including previously collected data from 6 age-matched control subjects and 8 severely impaired stroke survivors. For all groups, EMG spatial patterns were well explained by task-dependent combinations {{of only a few}} (typically 4) muscle <b>synergies.</b> Broadly speaking, elbow-related <b>synergies</b> were conserved across stroke survivors, regardless of impairment level. In contrast, the shoulder-related <b>synergies</b> of some stroke survivors with mild and moderate impairment differed from controls, {{in a manner similar to}} severely impaired subjects. Cluster analysis of pooled <b>synergies</b> for the 30 subjects identified 7 distinct clusters (<b>synergies).</b> Subsequent analysis confirmed that the incidences of 3 elbow-related <b>synergies</b> were independent of impairment level, while the incidences of 4 shoulder-related <b>synergies</b> were systematically correlated with impairment level. Overall, our results suggest that alterations in the shoulder muscle <b>synergies</b> underlying isometric force generation appear prominently in mild and moderate stroke, as in most cases of severe stroke, in an impairment level-dependent manner...|$|R

Here, we hypothesized that reactive balance and walking are mediated by a common set of lower-limb muscle <b>synergies.</b> In humans, we examined muscle activity during multidirectional support-surface perturbations during standing and walking, as well as unperturbed walking at two speeds. We show that most muscle <b>synergies</b> used in perturbations responses during standing were also used in perturbation responses during walking, suggesting common neural mechanisms for reactive balance across different contexts.

40|$|What {{drives the}} price of a merger and {{acquisition}} deal? What enables some buyers to outbid others when competing over the same target? The objective of this thesis is to determine which <b>synergies</b> that different market actors consider as key <b>synergies,</b> how the actors quantify and value <b>synergies</b> and how the <b>synergies</b> impact the acquisition premium. The topic has been investigated through semi structured interviews and a survey with eight different market actors in the merger and acquisition industry. Our conclusions indicate that the assessment of what are key <b>synergies</b> depends on the reason to acquire and the time horizon of the buyer. Most actors find cost reducing <b>synergies</b> the easiest to quantify and common industry practice seems to be to only account for these in the acquisition business case. The most preferred method when valuing <b>synergies</b> related to mergers and acquisition is to use a discounted cash flow model and to utilize different comparable multiples as benchmarks.

This includes iris patterns, palm print, hand geometry, facial recognition, and movement patterns (hand motion, gait, and eye movements). Identity verification systems may benefit from the complexity of human movement that integrates multiple levels of control (neural, muscular, and kinematic).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to test the {{principle}} of motor abundance as compared to motor redundance, by investigating the changes in force stabilizing and moment stabilizing <b>synergies</b> for pressing tasks involving different number of fingers (IM, IR, IL, MR, ML, RL, IMR, IML, IRL, MRL, IMRL; where I=Index, M=Middle, R=Ring, L=Little). Twelve healthy right-handed subjects (6 males and 6 females, 27 4. 3 years) participated in the experiment. Subjects were explicitly provided a visual feedback of forces for a constant multi finger force production task. Since subjects were explicitly given a visual feedback of their performance for the force production task, strong force stabilizing <b>synergies</b> were expected (Hypothesis 1). Based on the principle of abundance, we hypothesized that the force stabilizing <b>synergies</b> would increase with the number of fingers (Hypothesis 2). Assuming that the precise moment stabilizing <b>synergies</b> are conditioned by everyday prehension experiences, we hypothesized that moment stabilizing <b>synergies,</b> if existing, would increase with the number of fingers, since all the fingers are generally used for everyday prehension and manipulation tasks, and such tasks require a precise control of moments (Hypothesis 3). Also, if both the <b>synergies</b> existed simultaneously, we hypothesized that those <b>synergies</b> would be more prominent when more fingers are involved in the task (Hypothesis 4). It was found that strong force stabilizing <b>synergies</b> existed for all the finger combinations, thus confirming our first hypothesis. However, these force stabilizing <b>synergies</b> reduced with an increase in the number of task fingers, disproving our second hypothesis. Moment destabilizing <b>synergies</b> were found for the two finger combinations and no moment <b>synergies</b> were present for the three finger combinations. However, moment stabilizing <b>synergies</b> existed for the four finger combinations. This confirmed our third and fourth hypothesis. We interpret the findings an evidence for the principle of abundance for stabilization of moments during pressing tasks, regardless of the fact that only the visual feedback of forces was given to the subjects...|$|R
