40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{decision}} {{strategies for}} rating objects in knowledge-shared research networks are proposed. The objects {{can be of}} various kinds and they are represented by an Object Vector that consists of General Description Part (extended Dublin Core) and Classification Part. Based on this representation, 3 possible cases for searching for appropriate objects in the network are considered and decision strategies are developed for each one of them. In case 1, the search is performed for all type of objects (for document objects, source code objects, executable code objects, picture objects etc.) that are relevant for a user specified task. In this case, three methods can be applied: 1). <b>Searching</b> <b>by</b> the KNIXSOM method, 2). <b>Searching</b> <b>by</b> decision making approach I (based on fuzzy sets theory), 3). <b>Searching</b> <b>by</b> decision making approach II that {{is a combination of}} the KNIXSOM method and the decision making approach I. In case 2, the search is performed only for document objects and five methods can be applied: 1). <b>Searching</b> <b>by</b> the KNIXSOM method, 2). <b>Searching</b> <b>by</b> the WEBSOM method, 3). <b>Searching</b> <b>by</b> the decision making approach I, 4). <b>Searching</b> <b>by</b> decision making approach II, 5). <b>Searching</b> <b>by</b> decision making approach III that is a combination of the WEBSOM method and the decision making approach I. In case 3, the search is done only for executable code objects that would be relevant for a user specified task. In this case, decision making approach IV is applied. In the paper also a method is proposed for comparison of the developed decision strategies...|$|R

After entering the Pacific U-862 scored her first success on this patrol when she attacked the U.S.-registered liberty ship Robert J. Walker off the South Coast of New South Wales on 24 December 1944. The ship sank the following day. Following this attack, U-862 evaded an intensive <b>search</b> <b>by</b> Australian aircraft and warships and departed for New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 is {{a yellow}} subgiant (spectral type G3 IV). It is about 65 parsecs {{away from the}} Sun that is larger than, but of a similar mass to, the Sun. However, HD 154672 is much older. The star is very metal-rich, {{which is one of}} the reasons why it was {{targeted}} for a planet <b>search</b> <b>by</b> the N2K Consortium, which discovered the gas giant planet HD 154672 b using Doppler Spectroscopy; the discovery was reported in October 2008. The N2K collaboration chose HD 154672 primarily because it aimed to discover the correlation between a star's metallicity and the mass of orbiting planets.|$|E
5|$|The <b>search</b> <b>by</b> Europeans for {{a western}} {{shortcut}} by sea from Europe to Asia {{began with the}} voyages of Christopher Columbus in 1492 and continued through the mid-19th century with {{a long series of}} exploratory expeditions originating mainly in England. These voyages, when to any degree successful, added to the sum of European geographic knowledge about the Western Hemisphere, particularly North America, and as that knowledge grew larger, attention gradually turned toward the Arctic. Voyagers of the 16th and 17th centuries who made geographic discoveries about North America included Martin Frobisher, John Davis, Henry Hudson, and William Baffin. In 1670, the incorporation of the Hudson's Bay Company led to further exploration of the Canadian coasts and interior and of the Arctic seas. In the 18th century, explorers included James Knight, Christopher Middleton, Samuel Hearne, James Cook, Alexander MacKenzie, and George Vancouver. By 1800, their discoveries showed conclusively that no Northwest Passage navigable by ships lay in the temperate latitudes between the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans.|$|E
