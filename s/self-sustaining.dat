Due to the highly nonlinear (mixed flexural-extensional) deformation of actuator/piezoresistors in such structures, they can provide two dominant output frequency harmonics.

40|$|We {{review the}} statics and {{dynamics}} of electric-field domains on doped superlattices within a discrete drift model. A complete {{analysis of the}} construction and stability of stationary field profiles having two domains is carried out. As a consequence we determine the intervals of doping on which <b>self-sustained</b> current oscillations may appear under dc voltage bias. We have also studied the influence of doping, boundary condition and length of the superlattice on the <b>self-sustained</b> oscillations. Our study shows that there are bistability regions where either <b>self-sustained</b> current oscillations or steady states are reached depending on the initial condition. For a wide bias interval, the <b>self-sustained</b> oscillations are due to the formation, motion and recycling of electric-field domain walls inside the superlattice. There are biases (typically {{in the region of}} bistability) for which the strength of the high and low field domains changes periodically in time while the domain wall remains almost pinned on a few quantum wells.

40|$|Bifurcation {{behavior}} of steady vibrations of cantilever plates with geometrical nonlinearities interacting with three-dimensional inviscid potential flow KV Avramov 1, 2 Cantilever plates with geometrical nonlinearities interacting with three-dimensional inviscid potential flow are con-sidered. The new method {{for analysis of}} stability and bifurcations of the plate <b>self-sustained</b> vibrations is suggested. The basis of this method is {{the solution of the}} singular integral equations with respect to aerodynamic derivatives of the plate pressure drop. The Von Karman equations with respect to transversal displacements and a stress function are used to describe the plate vibrations with geometrical nonlinearity. The combination of the shooting technique and the continuation algorithm are used to analyze bifurcations and stability of the plate <b>self-sustained</b> vibrations. The plate aeroelastic <b>self-sustained</b> vibrations lose stability due to the Naimark-Sacker bifurcation. As a result of this bifurcation, almost periodic and chaotic vibrations are observed.

40|$|There is {{consensus}} in the current literature that stable states of asynchronous irregular spiking activity require (i) large networks of 10 000 or more neurons and (ii) external background activity or pacemaker neurons. Yet already in 1963, Griffith showed that networks of simple threshold elements can be persis-tently active at intermediate rates. Here, we extend Griffith’s work and demonstrate that sparse networks of integrate-and-fire neurons assume stable states of <b>self-sustained</b> asynchronous and irregular firing with-out external input or pacemaker neurons. These states can be robustly induced by a brief pulse to {{a small fraction of}} the neurons, or by short a period of irregular input, and last for several minutes. <b>Self-sustained</b> activity states emerge when {{a small fraction of the}} synapses is strong enough to significantly influence the firing probability of a neuron, consistent with the recently proposed long-tailed distribution of synaptic weights. During <b>self-sustained</b> activity, each neuron exhibits highly irregular firing patterns, similar to experimentally observed activity. Moreover, the interspike interval distribution reveals that neurons switch between discrete states of high and low firing rates. We find that <b>self-sustained</b> activity states can exist even in small networks of only a thousand neurons. We investigated networks up to 100 000 neurons.

5|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{has been}} a leader in laser-driven {{inertial}} confinement fusion (ICF) since the initial concept was developed by LLNL employee John Nuckols in the late 1950s. The basic idea was to use a driver to compress a small pellet known as the target that contains the fusion fuel, a mix of deuterium (D) and tritium (T). If the compression reaches high enough values, fusion reactions begin to take place, releasing alpha particles and neutrons. The alphas may impact atoms in the surrounding fuel, heating them {{to the point where they}} undergo fusion as well. If the rate of alpha heating is higher than heat losses to the environment, the result is a <b>self-sustaining</b> chain reaction known as ignition.|$|E
