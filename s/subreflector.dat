5000|$|Any gain-degrading {{factors which}} raise side lobes have a {{two-fold}} effect, {{in that they}} contribute to system noise temperature {{in addition to reducing}} gain. Aperture blockage and deviation of reflector surface (from the designed [...] "ideal") are two important cases. Aperture blockage is normally due to shadowing by feed, <b>subreflector</b> and/or support members. Deviations in reflector surfaces cause non-uniform aperture distributions, resulting in reduced gains.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{problems}} that a satellite manufacturing involves is to obtain the geometrical forms and the accurate positions for the different radiofrequency components (reflectors, <b>subreflectors</b> and feeders). CFRP (Carbon Fibber Reinforced Plastics) sandwich structures never are obtained as designed due to the deformations associated to the manufacturing process. So, reflectors, <b>subreflectors</b> and structural components (towers, panels [...] .) have to be measured in order to include their deviations {{in the design of the}} regulation parts. High performance equipment (Co-ordinate Measurement Machines, CAD/CAM Systems and 5 Axis Machine Tool) is used, but it is also necessary to make an integrated and multidisciplinary team.

A geometrical optics (GO) based method is used to synthesize the shaped main reflector surface corresponding to the shaped <b>subreflector.</b> Using the proposed method, a shaped Cassegrain dual reflector system is designed. The field scattered from the <b>subreflector</b> is calculated using uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (UTD). Finally, a numerical example is provided showing how a shaped <b>subreflector</b> produces more uniform illumination over the main reflector aperture compared to an unshaped <b>subreflector...</b>|$|E

A feed means selectively excites only the central region of the main dish via a truncated <b>subreflector</b> for wide beamwidth or substantially the entire main dish for narrow beamwidth. In one embodiment, the feed means comprises a truncated concave ellipsoid <b>subreflector</b> and separate feed terminations located at two foci of the ellipsoid. One feed termination directly views all of the main dish while the other feed termination, exciting the main dish via the <b>subreflector,</b> excites only the central region because of the <b>subreflector</b> truncation. In the another embodiment, the feed means comprises one feed termination and a convex hyperboloid <b>subreflector</b> via which the feed excites the main dish...|$|E
40|$|Defocussing of {{the radio}} {{frequency}} beam arises from gravity-induced structural deformations as the 64 m Deep Space Network antenna rotates about the elevation axis. The <b>subreflector</b> controller generates the axial (z) and lateral (y) offset corrections necessary to move the <b>subreflector,</b> thus minimizing the gain losses due to this defocussing.

40|$|Both offset and {{symmetric}} Cassegrain reflector antennas {{are used}} in satellite and ground communication systems. It is known that the <b>subreflector</b> diffraction can degrade the performance of these reflectors.

40|$|Using a Cassegrainian geometry, the 64 -meter antenna {{with its}} {{distorted}} paraboloidal reflecting surface {{is forced to}} produce a uniform phase wavefront by a pathlength-compensating <b>subreflector.</b> First, the computed distortion vectors at the joints or nodes of the main reflector structure supporting the surface panels are best fitted to a paraboloid. Second, the resulting residual distortion errors are used to determine a compensating <b>subreflector</b> surface by ray tracing using geometric optics principles. Third, the totally corrected <b>subreflector</b> surface {{is defined by the}} normal directions and distances {{to the surface of the}} original symmetric hyperboloid for the purpose of evaluation. Finally, contour maps of distortions of the paraboloid reflector and the compensating <b>subreflector</b> are presented.

40|$|Structural {{deformations}} primarily {{occur as}} functions of antenna elevation angle {{due to gravity}} loading. For a Cassegrain antenna, {{one of the major}} effects of structural deformation on measured VLBI time delays are those delay changes associated with axial <b>subreflector</b> displacement from its nominal position. Two types of time delay changes that occur when the <b>subreflector</b> is axially defocused are: a change which is a linear function of <b>subreflector</b> defocus position; and a cyclical change caused by multipath. Test results show that for the 64 -m DSN antenna, the linear change is 1. 8 times the <b>subreflector</b> defocus position, while the peak-to-peak change in cyclical variation is about + or - 3 cm when a spanned bandwidth of 38 MHz at 2290 MHz is used...|$|E

40|$|A {{folded optics}} {{reflector}} system could mitigate {{problems associated with}} the pointability and controllability of the large UHF antenna for MSAT. Such a system is comprised of a parabolic main reflector and a hyperboloidal <b>subreflector</b> (Cassegrain arrangement) or an ellipsoidal <b>subreflector</b> (Gregorian arrangement), either of which brings the feed closer to the main reflector. By shaping the <b>subreflector</b> and the main reflector, an improved scan capability might be achieved {{and the size of the}} required feed aperture-per-beam could be reduced. In such a shaped dual reflector system, the need for overlapping cluster feed arrangement and its concomitant beam forming network could be removed. In this system, a relatively low gain feed element together with the shaped <b>subreflector</b> would be sufficient to produce the required high illumination taper that at the main reflector...|$|E
40|$|By {{probing the}} field on a small <b>sub{{reflector}}</b> at a minimal number of points, the main reflector surface errors can be obtained and subsequently used to design a phase-correction <b>subreflector</b> that can compensate for main reflector errors. The compensating phase-error profile across the <b>subreflector</b> can be achieved either by a surface deformation or {{by the use of}} an array of elements such as patch antennas that can cause a phase shift between the incoming and outgoing fields. The second option is of primary interest here, but the methodology can be applied to either case. The patch array is most easily implemented on a planar surface. Therefore, the example of a flat <b>subreflector</b> and a parabolic main reflector (a Newtonian dual reflector system) is considered in this work. The <b>subreflector</b> is assumed to be a reflector array covered with patch elements. The phase variation on a <b>subreflector</b> can be detected by a small number of receiving patch elements (probes). By probing the phase change at these few selected positions on the <b>subreflector,</b> the phase error over the entire surface can be recovered and used to change the phase of all the patch elements covering the <b>subreflector</b> plane to compensate for main reflector errors. This is accomplished by using a version of sampling theorem on the circular aperture. The sampling is performed on the phase-error function on the circular aperture of the main reflector by a method developed using Zernike polynomials. This method is based upon and extended from a theory previously proposed and applied to reflector aperture integration. This sampling method provides for an exact retrieval of the coefficients of up to certain orders in the expansion of the phase function, from values on a specifically calculated set of points in radial and azimuthal directions in the polar coordinate system, on the circular reflector aperture. The corresponding points on the <b>subreflector</b> are then obtained and, by probing the fields at these points, a set of phase values is determined that is then transferred back to the main reflector aperture for recovering the phase function. Once this function is recovered, the corresponding phase function on the <b>subreflector</b> is calculated and used to compensate for main reflector surface errors. In going back and forth between sub and main reflectors, geometrical (ray) optics is employed, which even though it ignores edge diffraction and other effects, is shown to be accurate for phase recovery...|$|E
40|$|Frequency {{selective}} <b>subreflectors</b> (FSS) {{are often}} {{employed in the}} reflector antenna system of a communication satellite or a deep space exploration vehicle for multi-frequency operations. In the past, FSS's have been designed for diplexing two frequency bands. For example, the Voyager FSS was designed to diplex S and X bands and the TDRSS FSS was designed to diplex S and Ku bands. Recently, NASA's CASSINI project requires an FSS to multiplex four frequency (S/X/Ku/Ka) bands. Theoretical analysis and experimental verifications are presented for a multi-band flat pannel FSS with double-ring elements. Both the exact formulation and the thin-ring approximation are described for analyzing and designing this multi-ring patch element FSS. It is found that the thin-ring approximation fails to predict the electrically wide ring element FSS's performance. A single screen double-ring element FSS is demonstrated for the tri-band system that reflects the X-band signal while transmitting through the S- and Ku-band signals. In addition, a double screen FSS with non-similar double-ring elements is presented for the Cassini's four-band system which reflects the X- and Ka-band signals while passing the S- and Ku-band signals. To accurately predict the FSS effects on a dual reflector antenna's radiation pattern, the FSS <b>subreflector's</b> transmitted/reflected field variation as functions of the polarization and incident angles {{with respect to the}} local coordinates was taken into account. An FSS transmission/reflection coefficient table is computed for TE and TM polarizations at various incident angles based on the planar FSS model. Next, the hybrid Geometric Optics (GO) and Physical Optics (PO) technique is implemented with linearly interpolating the FSS table to efficiently determine the FSS effects in a dual reflector antenna...|$|R

40|$|We have {{designed}} the central cone for the <b>subreflector</b> of the ACA 7 -m antenna. The cone is curved-shape and 53 mm in diameter, {{which is the}} maximum size {{to the extent that}} the cone does not affect the efficiency of the antenna even at the highest frequency of ALMA, 950 GHz. We have also optimized the profile parameters of the cone in consideration of off-axis feeds, especially for the lower frequency bands, so that the electric field reflected by the <b>subreflector</b> will be well suppressed within a radius of the vertex hole on the Cassegrain focal plane. According to our analysis, tilting the <b>subreflector</b> is effective to reduce the effi-ciency loss and the spillover for the main reflector. Since the same type of receivers will be used on both the 7 -m and 12 -m antennas, the <b>subreflector</b> of the 7 -m antenna should be tilted more than that of the 12 -m antenna. We have compared the cases of a non-ideal <b>subreflector</b> tilt angle (1. 215 degrees, i. e., the maximum tilt angle for the 12 -m <b>subreflector)</b> and an ideal tilt angle for the reference to mechanical design of the 7 -m antenna.

40|$|A novel {{method for}} calculating the surface shapes for <b>subreflectors</b> in a suboptic {{assembly}} of a tri-reflector spherical antenna system is introduced, modeled from a generalization of Galindo-Israel's method of solving partial differential equations to correct for spherical aberration and provide uniform feed to aperture mapping. In a first embodiment, the suboptic assembly moves {{as a single}} unit to achieve scan while the main reflector remains stationary. A feed horn is tilted during scan to maintain the illuminated area on the main spherical reflector fixed throughout the scan thereby eliminating the need to oversize the main spherical reflector. In an alternate embodiment, both the main spherical reflector and the suboptic assembly are fixed. A flat mirror is {{used to create a}} virtual image of the suboptic assembly. Scan is achieved by rotating the mirror about the spherical center of the main reflector.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{show how the}} {{ellipsoidal}} and hyperboloidal <b>subreflectors,</b> which are used in dual reflector antenna systems, can be emulated by reflectarrays (hereafter referred to as sub-reflectarrays). To achieve this we derive the basic design equations required to provide the proper phase correction at each element of the sub-reflectarray {{to end up with}} radiated amplitude and phase patterns that are indeed close to those of the emulated ellipsoidal or hyperboloidal <b>subreflectors.</b> To calculate and analyze the radiation patterns of sub-reflectarrays, which are designed based upon the above basic design equations; two analysis methods have been developed. One based on an array analysis approach which gives an approximate (yet reliable) analysis of sub-reflectarrays, with details that do not appear to have been given elsewhere. The second method is a two-dimensional (2 D) full wave computational electromagnetic analysis that uses the method of moments (MoM) to solve a 2 D integral equation formulation for a 2 D reflectarray. It is a very rigorous method that accounts for many effects which are computationally very difficult to be include in any three-dimensional (3 D) analysis methods {{that could be used for}} same purpose, like the finite ground plane effect and feed blockage effect. Both analysis methods have been validated by using them to calculate the radiation pattern of a parabolic-type reflectarray, which are frequently reported and very well known. Simulations are performed using the two analysis methods on examples of the ellipsoidal and hyperboloidal subreflectarrays described, showing the far field amplitude and phase patterns, in so doing validating the design equations and analyzing the radiation characteristics of the sub-reflectarrays. The 2 D MoM analysis enables us in this thesis to study the effect of amplitude tapering upon the radiation characteristics of sub-reflectarrays. Moreover it is used to determine the location of the virtual focal point as a function of feed position and frequency, which enables us to perform a detailed study of the power focusing characteristics of an ellipsoidal sub-reflectarary. Lastly, a practical experimental validation has been done by implementing some sub-reflectarrys and measuring their radiation patterns' amplitude and phase...|$|R
