25|$|Przewalski {{females are}} able to give birth {{at the age of}} three and have a {{gestation}} period of about 11 to 12 months. Their reproduction process is seasonal and in Mongolia the season is towards the end of May, June or July. Mating stallions do not <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> mating partners until the age of five. Instinctively, the stallion will look to create his own group of mares or else wander until he finds a group with its own leader. If the stallion finds a group of mares with its own leader, the stallion will usually fight the other leader stallion of the group. The mares will adjust and follow the victor. After birth, the foal can stand almost immediately (only taking about an hour or so) and can walk on its own. The foals drink milk from the mother mare.|$|E
25|$|Jonsvatnet is {{the main}} water {{abstraction}} source for drinking water in Trondheim. As such there have since the 1960s been extensive restrictions on the lake, including bans on any motorized boats and bathing in the lake. However, there were contradictions in restrictions: domesticated cows were allowed to bathe, but not humans, and all motor boat activities were banned, although the lake acted as a water aerodrome. The city asked the club in 1999 to <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> another site for a water aerodrome. The municipal council therefore withdrew the airport's concession in March 2003, effective {{at the end of}} the year. However, by August the decision had been reverted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). They gave a ten-year concession in 2005, but this was appealed by the municipality to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. During the public hearing, the Ministry of the Environment supported the municipality's stance, stating that the lake, as a recreational and nature area, should be shielded from use by seaplanes.|$|E

500|$|That day, {{the city}} closed all 11 of its {{municipal}} garbage incinerators. Energy companies Consolidated Edison (called Con Ed for short) and Long Island Lighting Company {{were asked to}} burn natural gas rather than fuel oil to minimize the release of sulfur dioxide; both companies voluntarily cut back emissions, with Con Ed reducing its emissions by 50 percent. The city told 18 inspectors [...] "to forget their turkey dinners and <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> dirty air," [...] and they issued an [...] "unusually high" [...] number of citations for emissions violations, including two for Con Ed plants. Representative William Fitts Ryan of Manhattan sent a telegram to Secretary of Health and Human Services John W.

[...] The employees suggest that Michael <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> another job. Michael is unworried at first, until he learns how poorly the economy is performing. He first tries Prince Paper, but they had been run out of business by Dunder Mifflin. After finding no available work, Michael decides {{to start his own}} paper company and unsuccessfully tries to convince others around the office to join him. When Charles catches Michael labeling Dunder Mifflin customer lists with his new company's name, he orders security guard Hank (Hugh Dane) to escort Michael from the building. Michael drives out of the parking lot, but is later spotted sneaking back into the building.|$|E
500|$|The website Touch Arcade {{said that}} they loved the game, {{and that it was}} one of their {{favorite}} role-playing games on iOS. They did however think that the game was bad at explaining things, including the system of saving one's progress. Pocket Gamer, too, thought that things were not explained enough. For instance, they said that the game does not guide players from point A to point B, and often does not even let players know where to <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> point B. RPGFan echoed this, and said that it is not uncommon for players to wander around, wondering where to go. Gamezebo said they did not think the battle system was particularly exciting, but appreciated how the conversation system and the demon fusion adds elements of risk and reward to the game. The British newspaper Metro found the game more entertaining than most role-playing games from its time. Gamezebo found the iOS version's touch screen-based virtual buttons clumsy to use, while Pocket Gamer found the interface to work [...] "reasonably well" [...] while using the landscape mode, and RPGFan found the interface to be excellent. Both Gamezebo and Touch Arcade wished the game had been a [...] "universal app", so that it could have been played on other devices than iPhone and iPod Touch without having the graphics upscaled.|$|E

500|$|Regarding the book's achievement, Shone remarks [...] "He {{now stands}} at year zero â€“ creatively, psychologically." [...] However, typical {{features}} of Ellis' earlier works remain intact; for example, in its depictions of violence. Commenting on its self-referential aspects, Janelle Brown of the San Francisco Chronicle recommends [...] "for his next endeavor, Ellis should stop worrying and <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> the exit of his own personal rabbit hole." [...] The Buffalo News awarded the novel its Editor's Choice. Jeff Simon comments that it [...] "brings an excessive Reaganesque flavor to Obama America". With regards to the novel's writing style, he comments [...] "The first-person sentences run on and on, but the individual sections of the book are nothing if not minimal... ghastly narcissism or not, Bret Easton Ellis has a fictional territory all his own and, heaven forbid, a mastery there." [...] The Wall Street Journal on the other hand, described this prose style as [...] "flat and fizzless". Such is the book's violent aesthetic that, for Eileen Battersby of The Irish Times, [...] "the book is closer to his remarkable third novel, American Psycho". She further compliments Ellis as [...] "a bizarrely moral writer who specializes in evoking the amoral." [...] Concerning his writing, she notes its [...] "despair is blunt, factual and seldom approaches the laconic unease of JG Ballard." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{allowing}} {{directors and}} writers {{to work within}} Marvel's shared universe concept, Joe Russo said that Feige has [...] "big pieces that he knows he wants to build towards, but {{the way that you}} get there is open to interpretation and improv a little bit." [...] For the Russos in The Winter Soldier, they {{had to deal with the}} idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. being infiltrated by Hydra, with Joe saying, [...] "how we get there is all up to us. And I think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film." [...] Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team [...] "come up with conceptually what we want to do" [...] for a film, then we will ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film? That's where you <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> the interconnectedness, but it's very important early on that the concept be created in a bubble because you have to protect the idea, it has to be driven by storytelling. Kevin's ... always in the mindset of [...] "let's just make this movie now and worry about the next movie when it comes." ...|$|E

2500|$|A [...] "new Siberian metal", platinum, {{became known}} in Russia in 1819. Though {{it was first}} {{observed}} only as minor inclusions in rocks, richer deposits were discovered in the late 1824 which were mined beginning in 1825. These discoveries prompted Demidov to <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> platinum around his Nizhny Tagil plants, where it was quickly found along the river beds. In late 1826, P. G. Sobolevsky (the father of powder metallurgy in Russia) invented a simple way of processing platinum that prompted the idea to use platinum in coins. The decree of 24 April 1828 noted that [...] "among the treasures of the Ural Mountains also occurs platinum, which priorly was located almost exclusively in South America. For easy sale of this precious metal, it is desirable to introduce it in coins" [...] and also described the design of new coins.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the club}} was first formed in 1882, the club played its matches on public land at the Park Lane end of Tottenham Marshes. As the ground was on public land, the club could not charge {{admission}} fees for spectators, and {{while the number of}} spectators grew to a few thousands within a few years, it yielded no gate receipts. In 1888, the club rented a pitch at Asplins Farm next to the railway line at Northumberland Park at a cost of Â£17 per annum, with the spectators charged 3d a game. [...] The first stand with just over 100 seats and changing rooms underneath was built on the ground for the 1894â€“95 season. Overcrowding at the ground however would become an issue; in 1898, during a match against Woolwich Arsenal attended by a record crowd of 15,000, the refreshment stand collapsed when fans climbed up onto its roof in the overcrowded ground, prompting the club to <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a new ground. In 1899, the club moved a short distance to a piece of land behind the White Hart pub, which would become the White Hart Lane ground.|$|E
