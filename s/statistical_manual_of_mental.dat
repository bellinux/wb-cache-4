5|$|Self-harm (SH), {{also known}} as self-injury, {{is defined as the}} intentional, direct {{injuring}} of body tissue, done without suicidal intentions. These terms are used in the more recent literature in an attempt to reach a more neutral terminology. The older literature, especially that which predates the Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders (DSM-5), almost exclusively refers to self-mutilation.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia is {{diagnosed}} based on criteria {{in either the}} American Psychiatric Association's (APA) fifth edition of the Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders (DSM 5), or the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment, before a diagnosis is made. As of 2013 there is no objective test.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Asperger's is unknown. While it is {{probably}} partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) as of 2015.|$|E

40|$|The Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> (DSM) <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> {{disorders}} is evaluated {{according to}} the empirical scientific criteria of validity and reliability, and it {{is found to be}} fundamentally flawed on both counts. Additionally, any diagnostic approach based on the objectivizing principles of empirical science is found to be both ontologically and epistemologically unable to account for the complexity of human subjectivity/intersubjectivity. A revisioning of psychological diagnosis according to specifically human scientific criteria is called for; and an outline of criteria to serve as fundamental guidelines for the development of phenomenological and holistic approaches to diagnosis is presented...|$|R
5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E
5|$|Lorna Wing popularized {{the term}} Asperger {{syndrome}} in the English-speaking medical community in her 1981 {{publication of a}} series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms, and Uta Frith translated Asperger's paper to English in 1991. Sets of diagnostic criteria were outlined by Gillberg and Gillberg in 1989 and by Szatmari et al. in the same year. AS became a standard diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the tenth edition of the World Health Organization's diagnostic manual, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10); in 1994, it was added to the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic reference, Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders (DSM-IV).|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the overlap between AS and high-functioning autism (HFA—autism unaccompanied by {{intellectual}} disability) is unclear. The ASD classification is to some extent an artifact of how autism was discovered, and may not reflect {{the true nature of}} the spectrum; methodological problems have beset Asperger syndrome as a valid diagnosis from the outset. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate diagnosis, was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder. Like the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, the change was controversial and AS was not removed from the WHO's ICD-10.|$|E
40|$|We {{may be on}} {{the cusp}} of a major {{paradigm}} shift in our thinking about psychiatric disorders. The proposed revision of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> (DSM) <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders franchise for the classification and diagnosis of human distress, which will lead to the 5 th edition (DSM-V), has served as a catalyst {{for a wide range of}} criticism (most notably at www. ipetitions. com/petition/dsm 5 /).

This debate provides the opportunity to propose a more scientific grounded and clinically useful system...|$|R
40|$|Today, this is {{an undeniable}} truth that the {{children}} in lower ages not only need physical care but also need attention to all dimensions of their existence such as social, emotional, personal and intelligence development. The objective of present study {{is to examine the}} effects of selected educational games with and without ball on hyperactivity disorder of students. It is a semi-experimental study with control group. The statistical population and sample of present study includes all male students of elementary schools studying in region 1 of Miandoab Town studying during educational year of 2016 - 2017. As a result, 500 questionnaire forms are distributed and among the 300 returned formed, 60 individuals with highest levels of hyperactivity disorder are purposefully selected. The data-collection instrument of present study is Child Symptom Inventory developed based on Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> (DSM) <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders. The descriptive statistics of direction, frequency distribution, mean, standard deviation and the inferential statistic of independent t are used.

40|$|With the {{presentation}} of nonsuicidal self-injury disorder (NSSID) criteria in the fifth version of the <b>Statistical</b> and Diagnostic <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders (DSM- 5), empirical studies have emerged where the criteria have been operationalized on samples of children, adolescents and young adults. Since NSSID is a condition in need of further study, empirical data are crucial {{at this stage in}} order to gather information on the suggested criteria concerning prevalence rates, characteristics, clinical correlates and potential independence of the disorder. A review was conducted based on published peer-reviewed empirical studies of the DSM- 5 NSSID criteria up to May 16, 2015. When the DSM- 5 criteria were operationalized on both clinical and community samples, a sample of individuals was identified that had more general psychopathology and impairment than clinical controls as well as those with NSSI not meeting criteria for NSSID. Across all studies interpersonal difficulties or negative state preceding NSSI was highly endorsed by participants, while the distress or impairment criterion tended to have a lower endorsement. Results showed preliminary support for a distinct and independent NSSID diagnosis, but additional empirical data are needed with direct and structured assessment of the final DSM- 5 criteria in order to reliably assess and validate a potential diagnosis of NSSID...|$|R
5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E
