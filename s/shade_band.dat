These data are used for several research and development activities consistent with the NREL mission: Establish a national 30 -year climatological database of measured solar irradiances; Support development of radiative transfer models for estimating solar irradiance from available meteorological observations; Provide solar resource information needed for technology deployment and operations. NREL will provide the supporting equipment (Shadow Bank Stand) for the specially designed <b>shading</b> <b>band.</b> FSEC will provide the calibrated pyranometer and perform data acquisition of the radiometer signal.

5000|$|Unfortunately, {{just when}} <b>Shades</b> and the <b>band</b> started getting successful, they had {{problems}} first with their label, {{and then with}} an American band that was using the same name. The contractual problem with their label, Heavy Metal Records, didnt want to let them sign with a major label, RCA Records, because they thought RCA didnt offer enough money to rescind their contract. The second lawsuit, another band, called Wrathchild, claimed they were using the name [...] "Wrathchild" [...] before the British <b>band.</b> <b>Shades</b> and the <b>band</b> won the first lawsuit, however it lasted six years. Enough time for RCA Records to change their mind on the band. Wrathchild also won the second lawsuit as well.

Later, due to tension with the other members, Shades was forced to leave the band.|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{an improved}} signal-to-noise ratio in a scanning optical microscope {{used to read}} out information from a magneto-optical data storage layer.

The signal-to-noise ratio improvement arises from differences in the signal and noise distributions in the pupil of the optical system. Although the experimental results are shown only in one dimension, the concept is applicable to two-dimensional scanning of low-contrast samples. © 1996 Optical Society of America It has been known for some time that placing apodizing filters in the pupil of scanning optical microscopes can change the system transfer function and influence the resolution of the resulting image. 1 This concept has been applied to optical data storage systems, which are essentially scanning optical microscopes, to increase data density. 2 However, the literature does not discuss in detail how filters influence the signalto-noise ratio of the image.

Burse {{recorded}} over 60 tracks {{as a member of the}} Memphis Jug <b>Band.</b> <b>Shade</b> and Burse exhibited notable differences in temperament. Shade was businesslike and orderly, acting as the band’s business manager and generating a substantial income from its recordings, enough to purchase a house for himself. Burse, in contrast, was described as a hell-raiser, and [...] "obnoxious and abusive at times". Surprisingly, however, there seems to have been remarkably little tension between the two men in their personal and professional association. Burse and Shade became lifelong friends, and the two would play together long after the Memphis Jug Band made its last recordings in 1934.|$|R
40|$|In {{respect to}} design {{composition}} and weave technique, the textile specimens uncovered at at-Tar Caves {{are similar to}} those unearthed at Dura-Europos, Palmyra and the Cave of Letters which lie along the East Mediterranean coastal areas. As far as more careful observations go, however, the at-Tar textiles have the following marked characteristics of their own. Many of their patterns are of tapestry weave. Their pattern representations often contain horizontal bands, unique ones of which have in the center such plant bands as flower, grapevine scroll and tree patterns, with the wave pattern <b>bands</b> and the <b>shaded</b> color <b>bands</b> symmetrically arranged above and below. And the <b>shaded</b> color <b>bands</b> are observed to change color gradually from light to dark, starting from the central pattern bands toward the pattern ends. With this sort of design composition compared with that of the finds from Palmyra and Dura-Europos, they are narrower than the at-Tar finds in pattern band width, and smaller and wavier than the at-Tar ones in pattern representation (Fujii, Sakamoto and Ichihashi 1989 : 122 - 125, 127, 128]. Moreover, there are some large, thin textiles with H-shape and gamma-shape patterns on them among the discoveries from at-Tar Caves, as well as from Nubia graves, Palmyra tombs and those from the Cave of Letters, Palestine. The at-Tar textiles with H-shape patterns have four H-shape patterns at the cente...|$|R

50|$|This {{butterfly}} is {{typified by}} its orange spots. The upperside of its wings are an orange to yellowish orange with black margins and black patches. The {{underside of the}} hindwings are colored a darker shade of gray and marked by a pale <b>shaded</b> <b>band.</b> Also found {{on the underside of}} the wings are two indistinct white spots along its upper boundaries. However, there are small discrepancies between the female and male genders of the orange giant-skippers. The males have orange spots that form a band on both the forewing and the hindwing. The outside portion of spot seven overlies the interior edge of spot six on its forewing. In females, the orange band is thicker and the inner end of spot nine on its forewing is pointed. Both genders have a wingspan that ranges from 1.75 to 2.375 in. The caterpillar form of the orange giant-skipper has a body that is usually a greenish or bluish white with a dark brown head Different from “true butterflies”, skippers rest with their forewings open at a forty-five degree angle and hindwings horizontal. Skippers are grouped together in part because of their swiftly direct and vigorous flight patterns. The butterfly deemed the Arizona giant-skipper (Agathymus aryxna) is sometimes confused with the orange giant-skipper due to their similar post median bands and coloring. However, the orange giant-skipper is typically distinguishable by its broader bands and its abundant orange coloring. Also, the Arizona giant-skipper has fringes that are almost always checked white and black while the orange giant-skipper’s fringes are usually no more than black.|$|R
