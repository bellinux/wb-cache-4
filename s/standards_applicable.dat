25|$|Public {{water supply}} and {{sanitation}} in Germany is universal and of good quality. Some salient features of the sector compared to other developed countries are its very low per capita water use, the high share of advanced wastewater treatment and very low distribution losses. Responsibility for {{water supply and}} sanitation provision lies with municipalities, which are regulated by the states. Professional associations and utility associations {{play an important role in}} the sector. As in other EU countries, most of the <b>standards</b> <b>applicable</b> to the sector are set in Brussels (see EU water policy). Recent developments include a trend to create commercial public utilities under private law and an effort to modernize the sector, including through more systematic benchmarking.|$|E
25|$|When the Court {{confirmed}} Congress' {{power to}} regulate the wage and hour <b>standards</b> <b>applicable</b> to employees {{of state and local}} governments, a different, more conservative Congress than the ones that had extended the FLSA to governmental employees in the first place now confronted the complaints from local governments that the Act was too inflexible and expensive to comply with. Congress responded by amending the Act in 1985, allowing governments to offer compensatory time off rather than overtime in some circumstances, creating an exemption for volunteers and excluding certain legislative employees from coverage under the Act. The Act also erased liabilities owed to employees who would not have been covered by the Act as interpreted by the Department of Labor's regulations prior to the Court's decision.|$|E
