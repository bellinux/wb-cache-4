5|$|Ancient <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> several {{different}} stories about Orion; {{there are two}} major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and after he violated her, was blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Although no Chinese sources {{detail the}} event, Portuguese <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> {{of how the}} Portuguese were summoned on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month to ceremoniously {{prostrate}} themselves before a wall of the Forbidden City to seek another audience with the emperor. From Beijing, the Portuguese embassy heard reports that the emperor reached Tongzhou in January 1521 and had the rebel Prince of Ning executed there. The Portuguese embassy had also become aware that ambassadors from the exiled King of Malacca were sent to Beijing seeking assistance from the Chinese emperor in expelling the conquering Portuguese so that their king could be reinstalled there. The Portuguese also knew of two officials in the Censorate—Qiu Daolong and He Ao— who sent memorials to the throne that condemned the Portuguese conquest of Malacca and that their embassy should be rejected. There were also reports sent to Beijing by Canton officials stating that the Portuguese were bothersome foreigners who sought {{to build their own}} trading post.|$|E
5|$|Æthelberht was put {{to death}} by Offa of Mercia under unclear circumstances; the site of his murder was {{apparently}} the royal vill at Sutton Walls. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he was beheaded. Mediaeval <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> how he was taken captive whilst visiting his future Mercian bride Ælfthyth and was then murdered and buried. In Richard of Cirencester's account of the murder, which cannot be substantiated, Offa's evil queen Cynethryth poisoned her husband's mind until he agreed to have his guest killed. Æthelberht was then bound and beheaded by a certain Grimbert and his body was unceremoniously disposed of. The mediaeval historian John Brompton's Chronicon describes how the king's detached head fell off a cart into a ditch where it was found, before it restored a blind man's sight. According to the Chronicon, Ælfthyth subsequently became a recluse at Crowland and her remorseful father founded monasteries, gave land to the Church and travelled {{on a pilgrimage to}} Rome.|$|E

25|$|Medieval Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic and Anglo-Saxon <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> of Migration Age Swedish kings {{belonging}} to the Scylfing dynasty, also known as Ynglings.

25|$|Other <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> of many Jews {{who were}} brought as {{prisoners of war}} from ancient Israel by PtolemyI and settled {{on the border of}} his kingdom with Nubia (Sudan). Another {{tradition}} asserts that the Jews arrived either via the old district of Qwara in northwestern Ethiopia, or via the Atbara River, where the Nile tributaries flow into Sudan. Some accounts specify the route taken by their forefathers on their way upriver to the south from Egypt.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> of {{the siege of}} the city from the {{perspective}} of the besiegers. No accounts of the events as seen from inside the city have survived to modern times. There is a total absence of Muslim sources, perhaps because of the absence of good writers in the city or perhaps due to a desire not to dwell on the loss of such an important city. Translations of some of the few Arabic texts that refer indirectly to the loss of the city are all that is available to cover this aspect of the history of the siege.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of <b>sources</b> <b>telling</b> the Story of Sinuhe. A {{limestone}} Ostracon in the Egyptian Museum is over a yard long, and is possibly the largest ostracon (a pottery or stone fragment) in existence. It tells the beginning of the Story of Sinuhe, and is inscribed in Hieratic. The story dates from the XII dynasty, and the fragment was found in the tomb of Sennutem.|$|R
25|$|Situated in the {{northeast}} and southeast of the Aare peninsula, the Nydeggstalden and the Mattequartier together constitute medieval Bern's smallest neighbourhood. Workshops and mercantile activity prevailed in this area, and medieval <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> of numerous complaints about the ceaseless and apparently nerve-wracking noise of machinery, carts and commerce. The Matte area at the riverside features three artificial channels, through which Aare water was diverted to power three city-owned watermills built in 1360. In the early twentieth century, a small hydroelectric plant was built in that location. Nearby, the busy Schiffländte (ship landing-place) allowed for the reloading of goods transported by boat up and down the river.|$|E
25|$|Already in 1603, the <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> us that harpsichords {{were used}} in the Spanish and Portuguese synagogues in Hamburg. Particularly in the Amsterdam community, but to some degree also in Hamburg and elsewhere, there was a flourishing of Classical music in the synagogues in the 18th century. There was {{formerly}} a custom in Amsterdam, inspired by a hint in the Zohar, of holding an instrumental concert on Friday afternoon prior to the coming in of the Shabbat, as a means of getting the congregants in the right mood for the Friday night service. An important Jewish composer was Abraham Caceres; music was also commissioned from non-Jewish composers such as Cristiano Giuseppe Lidarti, some of which is still used.|$|E
25|$|The {{available}} evidence includes the scanty contemporary and near-contemporary written record, and archaeological and genetic information. The few literary <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> of hostility between incomers and natives. They describe violence, destruction, massacre {{and the flight}} of the Romano-British population. Moreover, there is little clear evidence for the influence of British Celtic or British Latin on Old English. These points have suggested a very large-scale invasion by various Germanic peoples. In this view, held {{by the majority of}} historians until the mid to late twentieth century, much of what is now England was cleared of its prior inhabitants. If this traditional viewpoint were to be correct, the genes of the later English people would have been overwhelmingly inherited from Germanic migrants.|$|E

25|$|In 1644, Aurangzeb's sister, Jahanara, {{was burned}} when the {{chemicals}} in her perfume were ignited by a nearby lamp while in Agra. This event precipitated a family crisis with political consequences. Aurangzeb suffered his father's displeasure by not returning to Agra immediately but rather three weeks later. Shah Jahan had been nursing Jahanara {{back to health}} in that time and thousands of vassals had arrived in Agra to pay their respects. Shah Jahan was outraged to see Aurangzeb enter the interior palace compound in military attire and immediately dismissed him from his position of viceroy of the Deccan; Aurangzeb was also no longer allowed to use red tents or to associate himself with the official military standard of the Mughal emperor. Other <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> us that Aurangzeb was dismissed from his position because Aurangzeb left the life of luxury and became a Faqir.|$|E
500|$|There is no archaeological {{evidence}} establishing the tomb as Joseph's, and modern scholarship {{has yet to}} determine whether or not the present cenotaph is to be identified with the ancient biblical gravesite. [...] The lack of Jewish or Christian sources prior to the 5th century that mention the tomb indicates that prior to the 4th century it was a Samaritan site. Samaritan <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> of struggles between Samaritans and Christians who wished to remove Joseph's bones.|$|E
500|$|The first {{bridge that}} {{is known to have}} been built at this point was erected as a [...] "spacious stone bridge of 18 arches" [...] by Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair (Anglicised Roderic O'Connor), the King of Connacht, around 1049. However, medieval <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> of a [...] "bridge of 27 arches of divers(e) {{architectural}} form, each different from its fellow", which stood here for over 500 years. A stone bridge of 17 arches was certainly constructed in 1685 and this was detailed in profile drawings by Thomas Rhodes in 1833.|$|E

5000|$|One <b>source</b> <b>tells</b> us that Máel Petair {{was the son}} of a Máel Coluim, but {{tells us}} nothing about this. If this weren't bad enough, other sources say that his father was a man called [...] "Loren", and in fact that he was Mormaer of Mar. His name occurs in so many sources because he was the man who, in 1094, killed King Duncan II of Scotland, {{suggesting}} he was an associate of Donald III of Scotland.|$|R

500|$|The Diolkos was a {{trackway}} {{paved with}} hard limestone with parallel grooves running about [...] apart. The roadway was [...] wide. Since ancient <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> little {{about how the}} ships were hauled across, the mode of ship transport has largely to be reconstructed from the archaeological evidence. The tracks indicate that transport on the Diolkos was done {{with some sort of}} wheeled vehicle. Either vessel and cargo were hauled across on separate vehicles, or only the cargo was taken across and reloaded on a different ship at {{the other side of the}} Isthmus.|$|E
500|$|The Alexandrian {{edition of}} Sappho's poetry {{was based on}} the {{existing}} Athenian collections, and was divided into at least eight books, though the exact number is uncertain. [...] Many modern scholars have followed Denys Page, who conjectured a ninth book in the standard edition; Yatromanolakis doubts this, noting that though testimonia refer to an eighth book of Sappho's poetry, none mention a ninth. [...] Whatever its make-up, the Alexandrian edition of Sappho probably grouped her poems by their metre: ancient <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> us that each of the first three books contained poems in a single specific metre. Ancient editions of Sappho, possibly starting with the Alexandrian edition, seem to have ordered the poems in at least the first book of Sappho's poetry – which contained works composed in Sapphic stanzas – alphabetically.|$|E
500|$|Sappho's poetry was {{probably}} first written down on Lesbos, either in her lifetime or shortly afterwards, initially {{probably in the}} form of a score for performers of Sappho's work. [...] In the fifth century, Athenian book publishers probably began to produce copies of Lesbian lyric poetry, some including explanatory material and glosses as well as the poems themselves. [...] Some time in the second or third century, Alexandrian scholars produced a critical edition of Sappho's poetry. [...] There may have been more than one Alexandrian edition – John J. Winkler argues for two, one edited by Aristophanes of Byzantium and another by his pupil Aristarchus of Samothrace. [...] This is not certain – ancient <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> us that Aristarchus' edition of Alcaeus replaced the edition by Aristophanes, but are silent on whether Sappho's work, too, went through multiple editions.|$|E

5000|$|Gartnait of Buchan is {{the first}} Mormaer of Buchan to be known by name as Mormaer.

50|$|The {{extent of}} Rheged is disputed: {{none of the}} early <b>sources</b> <b>tells</b> us where Rheged was located. Some historians {{believe that it was}} based on the old Carvetii tribal region - mostly {{covering}} the Solway plain and the Eden valley. Others say that it may have included large parts of Dumfriesshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire. The Kingdom's centre was based, possibly, at Llwyfenydd, believed to be in the valley of the Lyvennet Beck, a tributary of the River Eden in east Cumbria, or, alternatively, at Carlisle.|$|R
500|$|Although other <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> a {{different}} story, Ward wrote that McAleer termed his [...] "break" [...] with Johnson {{as the result}} of a [...] "betrayal" [...] of trust. McAleer indicated that his controlling interest in the Red Sox entitled him to make all major decisions regarding the organization, Ward wrote. This view of McAleer's powers, however, was not shared by the club's manager, Stahl, the article added. To further complicate matters, Stahl's father-in-law, a Chicago-based banker, was reportedly a shareholder in the Red Sox. After one particularly heated exchange between Stahl and McAleer at the close of the 1912 season, Stahl went to Chicago to confer with Johnson. The article indicated that, after this meeting, Johnson sent McAleer a [...] "sternly worded" [...] letter, which may have been designed to preserve his relationship with Stahl and Stahl's father-in-law. According to the article, Johnson later confided to McAleer that he owed Stahl's father-in-law money and therefore felt obliged to take Stahl's side in the dispute. McAleer, however, took the admonition from Johnson as a betrayal of their friendship, refused to accept Johnson's explanations, and promptly retired, Ward wrote. This version of events is largely corroborated by the early research of baseball historian David Fleitz.|$|E
2500|$|Thomsen (1893) {{connected}} the script to {{the reports of}} Chinese account (Records of the Grand Historian, vol. [...] ) from a 2nd century BC Yan renegade and dignitary named Zhonghang Yue (...) , who [...] "taught the Chanyu (rulers of the Xiongnu) to write official letters to the Chinese court on a wooden tablet (...) 31 cm long, and to use a seal and large-sized folder". The same <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> that when the Xiongnu noted down something or transmitted a message, they made cuts {{on a piece of}} wood (gemu); they also mention a [...] "Hu script". At the Noin-Ula burial site and other Hun burial sites in Mongolia and regions north of Lake Baikal, the artifacts displayed over twenty carved characters. Most of these characters are either identical with or very similar to the letters of the Turkic Orkhon script.|$|E
2500|$|Ancient <b>sources</b> <b>tell</b> {{of another}} favorite, Bagoas; a eunuch [...] "exceptional in beauty {{and in the}} very flower of boyhood, with whom Darius was {{intimate}} and with whom Alexander would later be intimate." [...] Plutarch recounts an episode (also mentioned by Dicaearchus) during some festivities {{on the way back}} from India in which his men clamor for him to kiss the young man: [...] "We are told, too, that he was once viewing some contests in singing and dancing, being well heated with wine, and that his favorite, Bagoas, won the prize for song and dance, and then, all in his festal array, passed through the theatre and took his seat by Alexander's side; at sight of which the Macedonians clapped their hands and loudly bade the king kiss the victor, until at last he threw his arms about him and kissed him tenderly." [...] A novel by Mary Renault, The Persian Boy, chronicles that story with Bagoas as narrator.|$|E

Saddam became more interested as he saw Al Qaida's appalling attacks. A detained Al Qaida member tells us that Saddam was more willing to assist Al Qaida after the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Saddam was also impressed by Al Qaida's attacks on the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} that Goronwy's name appears in a list of witnesses to a contract of Llywelyn the Great as eartly as 1222. Thus {{it is likely that}} he had served as a court official together with his father before succeeding him as seneschal of Gwynedd on his death in 1246, or in the years between 1222 and 1258. A single <b>source</b> <b>tells</b> us that another son of Ednyfed, Gruffudd, was seneschal of Gwynedd from 1246 to 1256. Thus there is some doubt about tha succession in that period.|$|R
500|$|Many of the <b>sources</b> <b>telling</b> of the woes of tulip mania, {{such as the}} anti-speculative {{pamphlets}} {{that were}} later reported by Beckmann and Mackay, have been cited {{as evidence of the}} extent of the economic damage. These pamphlets, however, were not written by victims of a bubble, but were primarily religiously motivated. The upheaval was viewed as a perversion of the moral order—proof that [...] "concentration on the earthly, rather than the heavenly flower could have dire consequences". Thus, it is possible that a relatively minor economic event took {{on a life of its}} own as a morality tale.|$|R
