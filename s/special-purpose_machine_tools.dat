5000|$|Between 1800 and 1840, on the machine-screw side, {{it became}} common {{practice}} to build {{all of the}} relevant screw-cutting machine elements into engine lathes, so the term [...] "screw-cutting lathe" [...] ceased to stand in contradistinction to other metalworking lathe types as a [...] "special" [...] kind of lathe. Meanwhile, on the wood-screw side, hardware manufacturers had developed for their own in-house use the first fully automatic automated <b>special-purpose</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> for the making of screws. The 1760-1840 development arc was a tremendous technological advance, but later advancements would make screws even cheaper and more prevalent yet again. These began in the 1840s with the adaptation of the engine lathe with a turret-head toolholder to create the turret lathe. This development greatly reduced the time, effort, and skill needed from the machine operator to produce each machine screw. Single-pointing was forgone in favor of die head cutting for such medium- and high-volume repetitive production. Then, in the 1870s, the turret lathe's part-cutting cycle (sequence of movements) was automated by being put under cam control, in a way very similar to how music boxes and player pianos can play a tune automatically. According to Rolt (1965), {{the first person to}} develop such a machine was Christopher Miner Spencer, a New England inventor. [...] may have contemporarily independently invented a machine similar to Spencer's. However, the wood-screw-making machines of the 1840s and 1850s factory production machine tools as opposed to small-machine-shop machine tools, such as those developed by Cullen Whipple of the New England Screw Company and Thomas J. Sloan of the American Screw Company, had anticipated the machines of Spencer and Vander Woerd in various ways, albeit approaching the problem of automated screw production from a different commercial angle. All of the above machine tools (i.e., screw-cutting lathes; suitably equipped engine lathes and bench lathes; turret lathes; turret-lathe-derived screw machines; and wood-screw-factory screw machines) were sometimes called [...] "screw machines" [...] during this era (logically enough, given that they were machines tailored to screw making). The nomenclatural evolution whereby the term [...] "screw machine" [...] is often used more narrowly than that is discussed above.|$|E

Then, the 3 -D model is input into ANSYS, simulating the stress map and the nephogram of displacement deformation of the lathe tool fixture and tool carrier, which plays a important role in designing the lathe tool fixture and tool carrier. Intorduction The CNC <b>Machine</b> <b>Tool</b> for guide disc, which is mainly used in the guide disc producing in the product line of the hot rolling seamless steel tube, {{is a sort of}} <b>special-purpose</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> for metal cutting. Meanwhile, working face accuracy of the guide disc has a direct effect on the surface quality of seamless steel tube. Thereintoï¼Œlathe tool fixture is designed to fix the lathe tool, lengthen the arbor and enhance the strength of the arbor as well. It is fixed tightly in the tool carrier because of which the vibration caused by cutting can be lowered or absorbed in some case. In a word, machining accuracy of the guide disc working face is directly affected by the design of lathe tool fixture...|$|R
