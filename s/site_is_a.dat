5|$|The Hanford <b>Site</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mostly {{decommissioned}} {{nuclear production}} complex {{operated by the}} United States federal government on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington. The site has been known by many names, including: Hanford Project, Hanford Works, Hanford Engineer Works and Hanford Nuclear Reservation. Established in 1943 {{as part of the}} Manhattan Project in Hanford, south-central Washington, the site was home to the B Reactor, the first full-scale plutonium production reactor in the world. Plutonium manufactured at the site was used in the first nuclear bomb, tested at the Trinity site, and in Fat Man, the bomb detonated over Nagasaki, Japan.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{artifacts}} {{found in}} Iowa are Clovis points, large lanceolate points found occasionally {{in all parts}} of the state except for the Des Moines Lobe. Possible sources of game were giant Pleistocene megafauna, including mammoth, mastodon, and giant forms of bison, all of which are now extinct. While widespread, only two Clovis sites have been excavated in Iowa. The Rummells-Maske <b>site</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Clovis site in Cedar County; unfortunately, this site was damaged by plowing, although 20 points and point fragments were recovered. The Carlisle Clovis Cache Site in Warren County contained 38 unfinished stone tools that appear to date to the Clovis period, but these results have not yet been published.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} <b>site</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards {{the back of the}} house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located {{toward the back of the}} main room, were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{stimulating}} {{the development of}} urban areas, temples and religious buildings featured a number of unique aesthetic and structural features. The Temple of the Saintly Mother (圣母殿) and the Hall of Sacrifice of the Jin Temple (晋祠), located in a southeastern suburb of Taiyuan City, Shanxi province, are extant examples of early Song architecture. The Temple of the Saintly Mother is the main building of the Jin Temple, first built in the period between 1023 and 1032 and renovated in 1102. It has a double-eaved roof with nine ridges, and two dragon-heads with wide-open jaws biting {{the ends of the}} main ridge. The roof is supported by massive dougong brackets corresponding to drawings in Yingzao Fashi. The eaves of the Temple of the Saintly Mother curve upward slightly at each end, a characteristic of Song architecture. The columns of the façade, decorated with dragons that coil around the shafts, become progressively taller with increasing distance to either side of the central pair. The building has a porch around it, the sole example of such a structure; another unique feature of the <b>site</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> cross-shaped bridge that leads to the Goddess Temple.|$|E
5|$|In metapopulation terminology, {{migrating}} {{individuals are}} classed as emigrants (when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites are classed either as sources or sinks. A <b>site</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> generic term {{that refers to}} places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of juveniles that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure.|$|E

5|$|Pevensey Castle is {{a medieval}} castle and former Roman Saxon Shore fort at Pevensey in the English county of East Sussex. The <b>site</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Scheduled Monument {{in the care}} of English Heritage and is open to visitors. Built around 290 AD and known to the Romans as Anderitum, the fort appears to have been the base for a fleet called the Classis Anderidaensis. The reasons for its {{construction}} are unclear; long thought to have been part of a Roman defensive system to guard the British and Gallic coasts against Saxon pirates, it has more recently been suggested that Anderitum and the other Saxon Shore forts were built by a usurper in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to prevent Rome from reimposing its control over Britain.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are monogamous. The {{breeding}} season usually coincides with {{a crop of}} seeds after the local rainy season and at this time, the feeding flocks tend to break up into pairs. The nesting <b>site</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> slight depression in the ground, sometimes lined with {{a few pieces of}} dry foliage. Most typically, three cryptic eggs are laid, though occasionally there may be two or four. Incubation duties are shared and in most species, the males incubate at night while the females sit on the eggs during the day. The eggs usually hatch after 20–25 days. The precocial chicks are covered with down and leave the nest as soon as the last hatchling has dried out. The parents do not provide them with food and they learn, with parental guidance, what is edible and what is not. The chicks obtain their water from the soaked downy feathers on the adults breasts. At first the chicks are too small and young to thermoregulate, and are provided with shade during the hottest part of the day and brooded at night. They remain with their parents, as a family group, for several months.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{in decline}} {{by the end}} of the reign of Elizabeth I. Although the {{stonework}} was sound, minimal maintenance had led to significant deterioration of other parts of the structure. The manor was purchased in 1604 by Henry Hastings, 5th Earl of Huntingdon, who had his own castle in nearby Ashby-de-la-Zouch. The Melbourne property was then demolished and used as a source for building materials. All that remains of Melbourne Castle today is a section of wall about 15m (50ft) long and 4m (13ft) high and some foundations; nothing is known of the internal layout of the former building. The ruins are grade II listed and the <b>site</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> scheduled monument. There is no public access to the castle remains.|$|E
