5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} doping {{case from}} the 2007 Giro involved sprinter Alessandro Petacchi. Petacchi took five stage wins, but after the third of them, he tested non-negative for <b>salbutamol,</b> an asthma medication which Petacchi has a medical exemption to use. Petacchi was obligated as the stage winner to give a urine sample to the doping authorities, {{and it had a}} concentration of 1,352 nanograms per milliliter of <b>salbutamol,</b> above the 1,000 allowed by the medical exemption. <b>Salbutamol</b> has anabolic effects at high concentrations. Team Milram placed Petacchi on immediate provisional suspension following the Giro, which kept him from participating in the Tour de France later that season as he had planned. The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) asked the Italian Cycling Federation (FCI) for a one-year ban for Petacchi.|$|E
5|$|During the race, Alessandro Petacchi tested {{positive}} for elevated levels of <b>salbutamol</b> at a doping control on 23 May, after winning Stage 11. Petacchi has a medical exemption to use <b>salbutamol</b> {{in the treatment of}} asthma, but the concentration of the drug in his urine sample from this control was above the therapeutically accepted level. Though the Italian Cycling Federation originally refused to punish him, the Italian National Olympic Committee appealed the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, resulting in a suspension for the rider and forfeiture of all his results from the Giro.|$|E
5|$|If an anaphylactoid {{reaction}} occurs the acetylcysteine is temporarily halted or {{slowed and}} antihistamines and other supportive care is administered. For example, a nebulised beta-agonist like <b>salbutamol</b> may be {{indicated in the}} event of significant bronchospasm (or prophylactically in patients with a history of bronchospasm secondary to acetylcysteine). It is also important to closely monitor fluids and electrolytes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} stages, {{electrolyte}} levels are often abnormal and require correction. High potassium levels can be life-threatening, {{and respond to}} increased urine production and renal replacement therapy (see below). Temporary measures include the administration of calcium to protect against cardiac complications, insulin or <b>salbutamol</b> to redistribute potassium into cells, and infusions of bicarbonate solution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salbutamol</b> is the INN (international nonproprietary name) while albuterol is the USAN (United States adopted name). The drug {{is usually}} {{manufactured}} and distributed as the sulphate salt (<b>salbutamol</b> sulphate).|$|E
25|$|As a β2 agonist, <b>salbutamol</b> {{also has}} use in obstetrics. Intravenous <b>salbutamol</b> {{can be used}} as a tocolytic to relax the uterine smooth muscle to delay {{premature}} labor. While preferred over agents such as atosiban and ritodrine, its role has largely been replaced by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, which is more effective, better tolerated, and administered orally.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salbutamol</b> {{has been}} studied in subtypes of {{congenital}} myasthenic syndrome associated with mutations in Dok-7.|$|E
25|$|According to {{two small}} and limited studies, <b>salbutamol</b> {{increases}} performance on endurance exercise {{even for a}} person without asthma.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} who suffer frequent, severe, prolonged attacks, inhaled <b>salbutamol</b> {{has been shown}} in some studies to reduce their duration.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, aerosolised drugs, such as <b>salbutamol</b> or clenbuterol, may be used. Clenbuterol {{also has}} {{anti-inflammatory}} actions, {{and is therefore}} often preferred.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salbutamol</b> {{has been}} used to treat acute hyperkalemia, as it stimulates {{potassium}} flow into cells, thus lowering the level in the blood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salbutamol</b> {{is either}} {{filtered}} {{out by the}} kidneys directly or is first metabolized into 4'-O-sulphate, which is excreted in the urine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salbutamol</b> (albuterol), a β2-selective catecholamine, is {{administered}} by nebulizer (e.g. 10–20mg). This medication also lowers blood levels of K+ by promoting its movement into cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salbutamol</b> {{was first}} made in 1967 in Britain and became commercially {{available}} in the UK in 1969. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Salbutamol</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world of an inhaler which contains 200 doses is between US$1.12 and US$2.64 as of 2014. In the United States, it is between $25 and $50 for a typical month supply.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salbutamol,</b> {{also known}} as albuterol and marketed as Ventolin among other names, is a {{medication}} that opens up the medium and large airways in the lungs. It is used to treat asthma including asthma attacks, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). It may also be used to treat high blood potassium levels. <b>Salbutamol</b> is usually used with an inhaler or nebulizer but is also available as a pill and intravenous solution. Onset of action of the inhaled version is typically within 15 minutes and lasts for two to six hours.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salbutamol</b> was {{discovered}} in 1966 by {{a team led by}} David Jack at the Allen and Hanburys laboratory (a subsidiary of Glaxo) in Ware, Hertfordshire, England, and was launched as Ventolin in 1969.|$|E
25|$|The {{tertiary}} butyl {{group in}} <b>salbutamol</b> {{makes it more}} selective for β2 receptors, which are the predominant receptors on the bronchial smooth muscles. Activation of these receptors causes adenylyl cyclase to convert ATP to cAMP, beginning the signalling cascade that ends with the inhibition of myosin phosphorylation and lowering the intracellular concentration of calcium ions (myosin phosphorylation and calcium ions are necessary for muscle contractions). The increase in cAMP also inhibits inflammatory cells in the airway, such as basophils, eosinophils, and most especially mast cells, from releasing inflammatory mediators and cytokines. <b>Salbutamol</b> and other β2 receptor agonists also increase the conductance of channels sensitive to calcium and potassium ions, leading to hyperpolarization and relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salbutamol</b> is {{typically}} {{used to treat}} bronchospasm (due to any cause – allergic asthma or exercise-induced), as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It {{is also one of}} the most common medicines used in rescue inhalers (short-term bronchodilators to alleviate asthma attacks).|$|E
25|$|Epinephrine is used {{to treat}} a number of {{conditions}} including: cardiac arrest, anaphylaxis, and superficial bleeding. It has been used historically for bronchospasm and hypoglycemia, but newer treatments for these that are selective for β2 adrenoceptors, such as <b>salbutamol</b> are currently preferred.|$|E
25|$|Another study {{contradicts the}} above findings, however. The double blind, {{randomised}} test conducted on 12 non-asthmatic athletes concluded that <b>salbutamol</b> had a negligible effect on endurance performance. Nevertheless, {{the study also}} showed that the drug's bronchodilating effect may have improved respiratory adaptation {{at the beginning of}} exercise.|$|E
25|$|Alessandro Petacchi, {{a sprint}} specialist, tested {{positive}} for <b>salbutamol</b> at Pinerolo on 23 May in the 2007 Giro d'Italia, {{the day of the}} third of his five-stage wins in the event. Petacchi, an asthma sufferer, was suspended by Milram and forced to miss the Tour de France. He was later cleared after the drug was deemed to be therapeutic use.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salbutamol</b> is {{sold as a}} racemic mixture. The (R)-(−)-enantiomer (CIP nomenclature) {{is shown}} in the image at right (top), and is {{responsible}} for the pharmacologic activity; the (S)-(+)-enantiomer (bottom) blocks metabolic pathways associated with elimination of itself and of the pharmacologically active enantiomer (R). The slower metabolism of the (S)-(+)-enantiomer also causes it to accumulate in the lungs, which can cause airway hyperreactivity and inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Alessandro Petacchi, {{a sprint}} specialist, tested {{positive}} for <b>salbutamol</b> at Pinerolo on 23 May in the 2007 Giro d'Italia, the same day he claimed the third of his five-stage wins in the event. As a result, Petacchi, an asthma sufferer, was suspended by Team Milram and forced to miss the Tour de France because of the charges. Though he seemed cleared of the charges at one point, he was later suspended for one year.|$|E
25|$|Cooper's older brother, Carter Vanderbilt Cooper, {{committed}} suicide on July 22, 1988, at age 23, by jumping from the 14th-floor terrace of Vanderbilt's New York City penthouse apartment. Gloria Vanderbilt later wrote about her son's {{death in the}} book A Mother's Story, in which she expresses her belief that the suicide {{was caused by a}} psychotic episode induced by an allergy to the anti-asthma prescription drug <b>salbutamol.</b> Anderson cites Carter's suicide for sparking his interest in journalism.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} for mild cases is simply reassurance and topical treatment with calcium-channel blocker (diltiazem, nifedipine) ointment, <b>salbutamol</b> inhalation and sublingual nitroglycerine.For persistent cases, local anesthetic blocks, clonidine or Botox injections can be considered. Supportive treatments directed at aggravating factors include high-fiber diet, withdrawal of drugs which have gut effects (e.g., drugs that provoke or worsen constipation including narcotics and oral calcium channel blockers; drugs that provoke or worsen diarrhea including quinidine, theophylline, and antibiotics), warm baths, rectal massage, perineal strengthening exercises, anti-cholinergic agents, non-narcotic analgesics, sedatives or muscle relaxants such as diazepam.|$|E
25|$|Kurt Asle Arvesen and Daniele Contrini briefly {{broke away}} {{early in the}} stage, {{but they did not}} seriously seek to stay away. The peloton was {{together}} into Milan. Various breakaway attempts occurred on the Milan circuit, but none succeeded. Alessandro Petacchi won the resultant field sprint, though this was one of his many 2007 wins that was later stripped due to his irregular <b>salbutamol</b> levels in a test given earlier in the race. There were no significant changes to the race's standings, so Danilo Di Luca became the Giro champion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salbutamol</b> {{has been}} shown to improve muscle weight in rats and anecdotal reports hypothesise that it might be an {{alternative}} to clenbuterol for purposes of fat burning and muscle gain, with multiple studies supporting this claim. Abuse of the drug may be confirmed by detection of its presence in plasma or urine, typically exceeding 1000µg/L. The window of detection for urine testing is on the order of just 24 hours, given the relatively short elimination half-life of the drug, estimated at between 5 and 6 hours following oral administration of 4mg.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{not smoking}} and {{avoiding}} other lung irritants. Frequent hand washing {{may also be}} protective. Treatment of acute bronchitis typically involves rest, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and NSAIDs {{to help with the}} fever. Cough medicine has little support for its use and is not recommended in children less than six years of age. There is tentative evidence that <b>salbutamol</b> may be useful in those with wheezing; however, it may result in nervousness and tremors. Antibiotics should generally not be used. An exception is when acute bronchitis is due to pertussis. Tentative evidence supports honey and pelargonium to help with symptoms.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} cure for cystic fibrosis. Lung infections {{are treated with}} {{antibiotics}} which may be given intravenously, inhaled, or by mouth. Sometimes, the antibiotic azithromycin is used long term. Inhaled hypertonic saline and <b>salbutamol</b> may also be useful. Lung transplantation may be an option if lung function continues to worsen. Pancreatic enzyme replacement and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation are important, especially in the young. Airway clearance techniques such as chest physiotherapy have some short-term benefit, but long-term effects are unclear. The average life expectancy is between 42 and 50 years in the developed world. Lung problems are responsible for death in 80% of people with cystic fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|To induce labor: An {{intravenous}} {{infusion of}} oxytocin {{is used to}} induce labor and to support labor in case of slow childbirth if the Oxytocin Challenge Test (OCT) fail. It is unclear whether a high dose {{is better than a}} standard dose for labor induction. It has largely replaced ergometrine as the principal agent to increase uterine tone in acute postpartum hemorrhage. Oxytocin is also used in veterinary medicine to facilitate birth and to stimulate milk release. The tocolytic agent atosiban (Tractocile) acts as an antagonist of oxytocin receptors; this drug is registered in many countries to suppress premature labor between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation. It has fewer side effects than drugs previously used for this purpose (ritodrine, <b>salbutamol,</b> and terbutaline).|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, Russian hackers hacked the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ADAMS {{anti-doping}} {{system and}} released {{data on a}} number of athletes, including Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins. Therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) are medical exemptions athletes can be given when they need treatment for pre-existing medical conditions where the drugs used in the treatment are on the WADA prohibited compound list. The leak demonstrated that Wiggins had received TUEs for triamcinolone acetonide in June 2011, June 2012 and April 2013, a number of days {{before the start of the}} 2011 Tour de France, 2012 Tour de France, and 2013 Giro d'Italia respectively. Wiggins also received TUEs for <b>salbutamol,</b> fluticasone, formoterol and budesonide whilst at Team Highroad. Froome had received TUEs for prednisolone in May 2013 and during the 2014 Tour de Romandie.|$|E
25|$|A doping ban {{prevented}} González de Galdeano {{from taking}} part in the 2003 Tour de France. González de Galdeano was adjudicated by the French authorities to have doped, for his use of the asthma drug <b>salbutamol.</b> However, the UCI did not count this as a positive test so no sanction was applied. However, the French authorities took a more stringent line and prevented him for racing on French soil for six months, over the period of the Tour. Also, González de Galdeano had a good showing at the Deutschland Tour, finishing second on the fifth stage. However, on the penultimate stage, he crashed and broke his collarbone. As such, the planned appeal against the French ban became academic and González de Galdeano had to wait for the Vuelta. The 2003 Vuelta proved to be González de Galdeano's last Grand Tour as a leading protagonist. González de Galdeano went into the Vuelta as ONCE team leader, however, young team mate Isidro Nozal rode well throughout, until the penultimate stage, a time trial in which he lost over two minutes to Roberto Heras, the eventual race winner. González de Galdeano finished fourth overall.|$|E
500|$|Petacchi was not {{the only}} rider {{identified}} as giving a non-negative doping test during the Giro. Reports emerged in June that three riders were under suspicion of doping, later identified as Petacchi, Leonardo Piepoli, and Iban Mayo. Petacchi and Piepoli both gave tests showing elevated levels of <b>salbutamol,</b> while Mayo's had abnormally high testosterone levels. Mayo was quickly cleared, as further testing revealed that his testosterone levels were of natural origin and that his team [...] had informed the UCI of this. Though Piepoli's level of <b>salbutamol</b> was, at 1,800 nanograms per milliliter, even higher than Petacchi's, he was cleared by his national federation of any doping charges in August.|$|E
