The compact {{requires}} the Upper Basin states not to deplete {{the flow of}} the river below [...] during any period of ten consecutive years. Based on rainfall patterns observed in the years before the treaty's signing in 1922, the amount specified in the compact was assumed to allow a roughly equal division of water between the two regions. The states within each basin were required to divide their 7500000 acre foot per year (289 m³/s) <b>share</b> <b>allotment</b> among themselves. The compact enabled the widespread irrigation of the Southwest, as well as the subsequent development of state and federal water works projects under the United States Bureau of Reclamation.

40|$|The study {{examines}} the pricing determinants of {{initial public offerings}} (IPOs) in the Hong Kong and Taiwanese markets. Consistent with the literature, {{we find that the}} IPOs are underpriced in these two markets. Among the pricing determinants we examine, <b>share</b> <b>allotment</b> over the number of participating applicants appears {{to be the most important}} common factor. However, different IPO market characteristics do exist between the markets. We document that investment firms are underpriced while the trading and service firms are overpriced during the IPO events in Hong Kong. In contrast, liquidity appears to be positively related to the initial underpricing of IPO firms in Taiwan. Our evidence therefore supports the winner's curse model proposed by Rock (1986), and to some extent the liquidity theory by Booth and Chua (1996). The applicability and implications of our findings should also be of value to firms seeking external equities in these markets. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the intraday patterns of IPOs in Hong Kong {{during the period}} 1995 - 1998. The results reveal that the well-known under-pricing phenomenon of IPOs occurs only at the opening trading of new issues and vanishes afterwards. The return volatility of IPOs {{is found to be}} high during the first trading session, and declines rapidly {{during the rest of the}} first trading day until the end of the trading day. The intraday return volatility of IPOs is found to follow a double U-shape pattern, which is similar to that of the general market. A great deal of trading activity was recorded during the first five minutes of the trading day. Consistent results are obtained for IPOs registered during the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. This paper has practical implications for investors. Investors can benefit from the under-pricing only if they subscribe for new shares in the primary market. There is, however, no profit-making opportunity for day traders who buy shares on the first trading day. This shows that the Hong Kong market is efficient in adjusting for the IPO under-pricing. In addition, it is likely that, because of Hong Kong's <b>share</b> <b>allotment</b> method, only big investors who apply for large numbers of shares can benefit from this under-pricing phenomenon.

5000|$|The {{use of the}} double-headed eagle as a Russian coat of arms {{goes back}} to the 15th century. With the fall of Constantinople {{and the end of the}} Byzantine Empire in 1453, the Grand Dukes of Muscovy came to see {{themselves}} as the successors of the Byzantine heritage, a notion reinforced by the marriage of Ivan III to Sophia Paleologue (hence the expression [...] "Third Rome" [...] for Moscow and, by extension, for the whole of Imperial Russia). Ivan adopted the golden Byzantine double-headed eagle in his seal, first documented in 1472, marking his direct claim to the Roman imperial heritage and posing as a sovereign equal and rival to the Holy Roman Empire. In 1497 it was stamped on a charter of <b>share</b> and <b>allotment</b> of independent princes' possessions. At about the same time, the image of a gilt, double-headed eagle on a red background appeared on the walls of the Palace of Facets in the Moscow Kremlin.|$|R

40|$|Prior Hong Kong-based {{studies have}} dealt {{predominantly}} with Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) configured in a single-tranche offer form (see McGuinness (1992); Cheng et al. (2004); Fung et al. (2004); Vong (2006) {{for the main}} board; and Vong and Zhao (2008) for the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM)). This study revisits the issue by examining a recent set of IPOs utlizing a dual-tranche offer form, in which a local retail offer {{is accompanied by a}} book-built placing. This mechanism utilizes a number of features ('claw-backs', adjustable offer prices and over-allotment options) which allow for important supply and demand adjustments during the offer period. The absence of such features within the single-tranche offer form, which prevailed right up {{to the end of the}} 1990 s, suggests radically different pricing characteristics across single- and dual-tranche regimes. Assessment is first made of ex-ante type variables, constructed using publicly available data prior to the close in retail applications. Average retail subscription rates on issues immediately prior to a given offering, the clustering of IPOs and the performance of the overall Hong Kong secondary market in the period surrounding the retail application window all serve as significant factors in explaining both IPO returns and excess subscription demand. Mainland PRC-incorporation (H-share issuers), advising sponsorship quality, an issuer's propensity to disclose a forecast of earnings and price-to-earnings levels also appear significant. In terms of ex-post variables, both IPO underpricing and subscription demand were positively related to over-allotment option exercise and the SD of post-listing returns. Significantly, there is no evidence to support the notion that the incidence and/or size of subsequent seasoned equity issues helps to promote IPO underpricing. This is investigated by examining equity capital-raising activities over a 36 -month post-listing period. Given the mixed evidence to date (across markets and studies) on this issue, the results documented in this study provide an additional important data point to suggest that seasoned equity issuance is of second-order importance in relation to IPO underpricing. Finally, a measurement form for excess demand was also developed to reflect the idiosyncratic nature of the dual-tranche allotment mechanism. Subscription numbers were evaluated in relation to retail tranche supply adjustments, arising from 'claw-backs' and employee <b>share</b> <b>allotments.</b> Consistent with Vong's (2006) earlier work on simple IPO subscription rates, after-market volatility appeared much more strongly tied to excess demand than to initial return levels. A number of analogues of excess demand, notably over-allotment option exercise and the proportion of shares allotted to retail applicants subscribing at the minimum order level, were significant in explaining initial returns. Finally, and consistent with Hanley (1993), higher initial return levels were apparent in issues priced towards the upper end of the offer price range. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the mobile}} {{telecommunication}} sector, the high competitiveness {{has increased the}} complexity of strategic interactions among operators. As the vertical integration has become anything but a choice and not a compelling technical solution, the contest takes place {{at different levels of}} the components of the operator value chain: the network infrastructure, the service development and supply, and the relationship with consumers. Mobile virtual network operators act as retailers and concentrate on the last segment of the value chain by establishing commercial agreements with hosting network operators, which act as manufacturers, to get access to radio communications infrastructure. Productive processes of mobile services offered by operators are different and this difference is imperceptible to customers. Processes difference mainly consists in the infrastructural diversity of the operators and implies different consequences on each network service element. A model has been defined to analyze the consequences of such diversity in the competition among HNOs, MNOs, and MVNOs by focusing the attention on the characteristics of the call path, in dependence of the types of operators. In fact, many variables interact to define the call path, such as marginal costs and revenues, infrastructural investments, and interconnection charges among operators. The analysis of the results, obtained by the model, gives information on variations of retail prices, market <b>shares,</b> and profit <b>allotment,</b> to adopt the proper strategies. In particular, the model results shed light on how certain MVNOs should enter the markets and adopt a collaborative strategy with HNOs. The model owns the capability of being applied to different contexts, thus representing for the regulator a potential instrument of relevant usefulness.
