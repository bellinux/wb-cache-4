The {{unconventional}} design by Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay was selected after an international competition. Without a typical dome, the mosque is shaped like a Bedouin tent, surrounded by four 260 ft tall minarets. The design features eight-sided <b>shell</b> <b>shaped</b> sloping <b>roofs</b> forming a triangular worship hall which can hold 10,000 worshippers, while the surrounding porticoes and the courtyard up-to 200,000 more.|$|R
40|$|Phenotypic {{convergence}} is {{a fascinating}} evolutionary pattern. Many taxa evolve remarkable similarities, often due to similar selection pressures, which suggest {{that there may be}} a limited number of solutions to a particular ecological challenge. However, some phenotypes are only superficially similar. For example, convergent evolution may occur at one phenotypic level such as behavior, but other components (morphology) of the same phenotype exhibit divergence. In other words, the solutions might be the same, but how taxa approach the problem could be very different. This then suggests that there may be multiple phenotypic optima that can tackle similar ecological challenges. In this dissertation, I investigate the evolutionary patterns of life habits and <b>shell</b> <b>shapes</b> in scallops and how these phenotypic traits contribute to biological diversity. I found many scallop species have converged in life habit, but only a few lineages converged in <b>shell</b> <b>shape.</b> Rather, <b>shell</b> <b>shape</b> variation tends to be greater in species with less specific life habit requirements. However, scallop species with the gliding life habit have lesser <b>shell</b> <b>shape</b> variation. Interestingly, gliding can be performed by two distinct <b>shell</b> <b>shapes,</b> indicating that only some components of <b>shell</b> <b>shape</b> are important for the life habit, and others are free to vary. This research indicates that there is likely greater diversity in form, despite phenotypic similarities in function...|$|R

Urabe's controlled breeding studies also supported Goodrich's speculation that the heritable component of such <b>shell</b> <b>shape</b> variation may be negligible.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Allopatric {{populations of}} Mytilus species show {{distinct}} shell morphology {{which may be}} due to genetic and/or environmental eects. Sympatric popu-lations ofMytilus species show similar shell morphology which {{may be due to}} hybridization eroding morpho-logical dierences and/or the influence of common en-vironmental conditions. The present study examined shell morphology and <b>shell</b> <b>shape</b> from 16 sites in eastern Newfoundland where M. edulis L. and M. trossulus Gould coexist in common environments with limited hybridization. Shell morphology was based on mea-surements of eight characters, and <b>shell</b> <b>shape</b> was quantified by elliptic Fourier analysis of shell outlines. Significant dierences were observed between species for both shell morphology and <b>shell</b> <b>shape</b> across 16 sites sampled. The relatively small dierences in morphology and shape between the species were probably due to exposure to common environments rather than hybrid-ization. <b>Shell</b> <b>shape</b> for M. edulis was more eccentric compared to M. trossulus which was more elongated. <b>Shell</b> <b>shape</b> analysis of a range of size classes at one site showed a change from an eccentric to an elongated shape going from the smaller to the larger size classes. Both species showed a similar trend, with the larger M. edulis more eccentric and the larger M. trossulus more elongated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} control of an actuated bivalve robot, which has been developed to study the burrowing locomotion of bivalves in sediment. The setup consists of a tank filled with sand and water, plastic models of bivalve shells capable of expelling water and an external actuation mechanism simulating the rocking burrowing motion typically used by these animals. The realistic <b>shell</b> <b>shapes</b> have been realized using three-dimensional plotting techniques allowing testing influences of different <b>shell</b> <b>shapes</b> and surface structures (sculptures) on the burrowing efficiency. Based on the experimental setup, the burrowing process has been reproduced. The results show that this setup {{can be used to}} identify correlations in the burrowing process. Further experimental work will investigate the influence of factors such as <b>shell</b> <b>shape</b> and sculpture or the motion sequence on the burrowing performance...|$|R

40|$|Pomacea caniculata or Golden Apple Snail (GAS) existed to be a {{rice pest}} in the Philippines and in Asia. Likewise, {{geographic}} location also contributes its increasing populations thus making it invasive among freshwater habitats and rice field areas. This {{study was conducted}} in order to describe <b>shell</b> <b>shape</b> variations and sexual dimorphism among the populations of P. caniculata. A total of 180 were randomly collected in the three lakes of Esperanza, Agusan del Sur (Lake Dakong Napo, Lake Oro, and Lake Cebulan), of which each lake comprised of 60 samples (30 males and 30 females). To determine the variations and sexual dimorphism in the <b>shell</b> <b>shape</b> of golden apple snail, coordinates was administered to relative warp analysis and the resulting data were subjected to Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA). The results show statistically significant (P< 0. 05) from the appended male and female dorsal and ventral/apertural portion. While male and female spire height, body size, and <b>shell</b> <b>shape</b> opening also shows significant variations. These phenotypic distinctions could be associated with geographic isolation, predation and nutrient component of the gastropods. Thus, the importance of using geometric morphometric advances in describing sexual dimorphism in the <b>shell</b> <b>shape</b> of P. caniculata...|$|R

40|$|Deformation {{behavior}} and energy absorbing {{performance of the}} press formed aluminum alloy A 5052 shells were investigated to obtain the basic information regarding the mutual effect of the <b>shell</b> <b>shape</b> and the indentor. Flat top and hemispherical shells were indented by the flat- or hemispherical-headed indentor. Indentation force in the rising stage was sharper for both <b>shell</b> <b>shapes</b> when the flat indentor was used. Remarkable force increase due to high in-plane compressive stress arisen by the appropriate tool constraint was observed in the early indentation stage, where the hemispherical shell was deformed with the flat-headed indentor. This aspect is preferable for energy absorption performance per unit mass. Less fluctuation in indentation force was achieved in {{the combination of the}} hemispherical <b>shell</b> and similar <b>shaped</b> indentor. The consumed energy in the travel length of the indentor equal to the shell height was evaluated. The increase ratio of the energy is prominent when the hemispherical indentor is replaced by a flat-headed one in both <b>shell</b> <b>shapes.</b> Finite element simulation was also conducted. Deformation behaviors were successfully predicted when the kinematic hardening plasticity was introduced in the material model...|$|R

40|$|Snails of {{the genus}} Coralliophila (Muricidae: Coralliophilinae) are common corallivores in the Caribbean, feeding {{on a wide range}} of host species. In the present study, the {{morphological}} and genetic variation in C. galea and C. caribaea were studied in relation to their association with host coral species at Curaçao. Differences in <b>shell</b> <b>shape</b> among snails living on different hosts were quantified using geometric morphometric and phylogenetic relationships were studied using two mitochondrial markers (12 S and COI). Based on these analyses, a new species, C. curacaoensis sp. nov., was found in association with the scleractinian coral Madracis auretenra. Both C. galea and C. caribaea showed host-specific differences in <b>shell</b> <b>shape,</b> size, and <b>shell</b> allometry (i. e. changes in morphological development during growth). Shell spire variability contributed foremost to the overall variation in <b>shell</b> <b>shape.</b> In C. caribaea minor genetic differences existed between snails associated with scleractinian and alcyonacean corals, whereas in C. galea such intraspecific variation was not found. These results shed more light on morphological and genetic differences among coral-associated fauna living on different host species...|$|R
