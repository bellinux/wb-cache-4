40|$|We {{measured}} the otolith chemistry of adult <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>icefish</b> (Chaenocephalus aceratus), a species {{with a long}} pelagic larval phase, along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and compared the chemistry with simulated particle transport using a circulation model. Material laid down in otolith nuclei during early life showed (i) strong heterogeneity between the Antarctic Peninsula and South Georgia consistent with a population boundary, (ii) evidence of finer-scale heterogeneity between sampling areas on the Antarctic Peninsula, and (iii) similarity between the eastern and northern shelves of South Georgia, indicating a single, self-recruiting population there. Consistent with the otolith chemistry, simulations of the large-scale circulation predicted that particles released at depths of 100 – 300 m on the Antarctic Peninsula shelf during spring, corresponding to hatching of icefish larvae from benthic nests, are transported in the southern ACC, missing South Georgia but following trajectories along the southern Scotia Ridge instead. These {{results suggest that the}} timing of release and position of early life stages in the water column substantially influence the direction and extent of connectivity. Used in complement, the two techniques promise an innovative approach for generating and testing predictions to resolve early dispersal and connectivity of populations related to the physical circulation of oceanic systems...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive {{capacity}} {{can influence}} distribution and abundance over large spatial scales through larval dispersal, even when adult stages remain isolated following settlement. We examined size distribution, reproductive traits and age structure in <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>icefish,</b> Chaenocephalus aceratus, an abundant benthic species {{with a long}} larval pelagic phase found on continental shelves along the Southern Scotia Ridge. In particular, we compared life history strategies between fish caught during surveys undertaken off the South Orkney Islands (SOI) and South Shetland Islands (SSI). Results corroborated regional separation after settlement and suggested distinct life history strategies, in which fish from SOI invested much less in reproduction, and somewhat more in somatic growth earlier in their life history. Compared to SSI, body weight increased faster with length and absolute fecundity was 46 % lower and increased more slowly with size for SOI population. In addition, the proportion of spawning cohorts and L∞ was lower and k higher for SOI. The differences {{appeared to be a}} phenotypic response to environmental conditions related to regional hydrography. Lower reproductive capacity around the SOI, and strong eastward flow in the large-scale circulation, suggests that the SSI may be more important in influencing distributions and abundance of icefish along the Southern Scotia Ridge...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} in situ observations on nesting by the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> (or blackfin) <b>icefish</b> Chaenocephalus aceratus (Lönnberg) {{that constitute the}} first substantive evidence of egg brooding and parental care by species of the family Channichthyidae. At Boutetoya Island six fish, all apparently male, were observed guarding egg nests at depths of 141 – 148 m during an ROV deployment. Eggs were laid as aggregated, round masses (~ 20 – 25 cm diameter) in shallow, circular depressions (~ 1 -m diameter, ~ 20 -cm depth) that were probably excavated by the parent(s) to protect the nests. The fish guardians remained tenaciously {{in contact with the}} eggs despite disturbances caused by the ROV, reacting to this threat with stress and defense behaviors. Because brooding fishes are more susceptible to the population impacts from trawl fisheries, we argue that this life history should be kept in mind in designing management schemes...|$|R

50|$|Seafloor {{spreading}} in the West <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> {{continued until}} 6.6-5.9 Ma. The oldest volcanic activity in Central and Eastern <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> i.e. {{the first signs}} of a volcanic arc, has been dated to 28.5 Ma. The South Sandwich Islands fore-arc originated in the Central <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> and was translated eastward by the back-arc spreading centre in the East <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> i.e. the East Scotia Ridge. South Georgia's eastward migration ended about 9 Ma when the microcontinent collided with the Northeast Georgia Rise large igneous province on the South American Plate north-east of South Georgia. A submerged equivalent to the current South Sandwich Arc was relocated westward by the same spreading centre. After, and probably because of, the collision, the East <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> spreading centre split the ancestral South Sandwich Arc leaving a remnant arc under the Central <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea.</b> The collision also produced the rugged Allardyce Range on South Georgia, making the 3000 m-high range three times higher than the conjugate rocks on Navarino Island in Tierra del Fuego.|$|R
50|$|The Late Paleocene to the Early Eocene (55 Ma) saw rift basin {{formation}} in the Fuegan Andes which led to crustal extension: {{the first sign of}} separation between the two continents and the formation of the South <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> and South <b>Scotia</b> Ridge. Spreading in the West <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> led to the further lengthening of the North Scotia Ridge and South Georgia moving further east. Spreading in the West <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> finally led to the rifting of the South Orkney microcontinent from the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. This event initiated the South Scotia Ridge.|$|R
40|$|A {{new model}} of plate {{kinematics}} in the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> region is presented in which continental crustal blocks and the signatures of seafloor spreading are defined semi-automatically using gravity and total field magnetic anomalies {{and some of their}} residuals, transformations and derivatives. This study is the first of the region to integrate gridded magnetic and gravity data in order to make reconstructions, {{and one of the first}} anywhere to make full use of gridded magnetic data in an inverse procedure. The context provided by the quantitative reconstructions allows qualitative assessment of visually-derived reconstructions of small movements in the region. The <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> floor consists of three large oceanic magnetic provinces: the west,central and east <b>Scotia</b> <b>seas,</b> and four smaller sub-basins, all enclosed within the elevated submarine and emergent Scotia Arc. The Scotia Arc consists of Mesozoic continental and Cenozoic island-arc fragments. Only the east <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> remains active; the west and central parts are the products of extinct spreading centres. West <b>Scotia</b> <b>sea</b> spreading is reasonably well described by tectonic flowlines expressed in satellite free-air gravity anomalies and magnetic reversal isochrons in total field anomalies. These data are combined in an inversion to reconstruct the west <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea's</b> margins between its inception at thron C 8 (- 26. 5 Ma) and extinction at chron C 3 a (- 6 Ma). The results suggest strongly, and for the first time, that the west <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> formed as a small ocean basin whose passive margins were Tierra del Fuego and the central <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> and not as a back-arc basin in the strict sense. During its growth the kinematics of the west <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea's</b> margins approximated those of the South American and Antarctic plates. The small kinematic differences are suggested to be due to convergence at the `proto-South Sandwich-Discovery' subduction zone, to the east of the central <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> and to dextral strike-slip (pre-C 6 (N 20 Ma)) and oblique convergence (post-C 6) at the North Scotia Ridge, the Mesozoic northern arm of the Scotia Arc. The most widely-accepted interpretations of the central <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> hold that it is a back-arc basin, but model flowlines about published reconstruction poles in the region show that instead it could have originated by accretion to the South American plate at the ancestral South American-Antarctic Ridge in the Weddell Sea, later to move eastwards as the eastern passive margin to the west <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea.</b> Magnetic reversal anomalies in the central <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> are consistent with its accretion in this way during the Cretaceous, probably between chrons M 4 and M 20 (- 126 - 149 Ma). All of this material was hitherto thought to have been destroyed completely by subduction at the ancestors of the South Sandwich subduction zone. The central <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> is thus also re-assigned in the model to have an oceanic, rather than back-arc basin, origin. Hence, the bulk of the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> floor formed as a consequence of the predictable movements of major plates following the break-up of Gondwana, with back-arc basins in the strict sense only forming small subbasins until the inception of the east <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> at or soon after C 5 c. The development of this much larger, oceanic, back-arc basin occurred following a change in the direction of relative motion at the West Scotia and South American-Antarctic Ridges at C 6. This {{new model of}} <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> kinematics, presented as a series of reconstructions of total field and Bouguer anomalies, is the first to be both self-consistent and consistent within the context of known major plate motions. The new interpretation of the central <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> is at odds with previous reconstructions which place South Georgia in the heart of a reconstructed compact connection between Tierra del Fuego and the Antarctic Peninsula. The altered position of South Georgia, south of Maurice Ewing Bank (Falkland Plateau) helps explain the puzzling provenance of its turbidites and suggests, as previous workers have done, that it may be appropriate to redefine the genesis of at least the eastern part of the Rocas Verdes Basin as an oceanic basin formed by accretion at a propagating rift, rather than (as before) a rare example of a back-arc basin formed behind an east-directed subduction zone. Although the new model is self-consistent, it is not uniquely so for two of the small basins in the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> (Protector and Dove Basins) whose age remains poorly defined. It can be speculated that either or both of these basins may have opened deep-water gateways in the Drake Passage region prior to spreading in the west <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> possibly in the Middle Eocene. A very tentative correlation between such events and initial cooling prior to the onset of Antarctic glaciation, via the cooling effect of establishing an efficient Antarctic Circumpolar Current, is suggested...|$|R
40|$|During the {{austral summer}} of 2008, we {{carried out a}} high {{resolution}} survey of the microplankton communities along a south to north transect covering a range of environments across the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> Southern Ocean; high and low productivity, sea-ice to open water conditions, and {{over a number of}} oceanographic fronts and bathymetric features. Cluster analysis revealed five distinct communities that were geographically constrained by physical features of bathymetry and fronts. From south to north the communities were: (1) the South Orkney group, a mixed community of naked dinoflagellates and heavily silicified diatoms, (2) southern <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> a mixed community of cyptophytes and naked dinoflagellates, (3) central <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> dominated by naked dinoflagellates, (4) southwest of the island of South Georgia, lightly silicified diatoms and naked dinoflagellates (5) northwest of South Georgia, dominated by diatoms.

The drifters detail Lagrangian transport pathways between the eastern Antarctic Peninsula and sites of elevated chlorophyll in the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea.</b> ACC frontal currents, in particular the Southern ACC Front, act as dynamical transport barriers to the drifters and influence surface chlorophyll distributions, indicating that ACC fronts partition Weddell source waters in the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea.</b> Interannual fluctuations in surface chlorophyll in the south <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> and the northern Weddell Sea covary.

40|$|The <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> is a {{sub-region}} of the Southern Ocean with {{a unique}} biological operation, including high rates of primary production, high abundances of Antarctic krill, and a diverse community of land-breeding predators. Trophic interactions link all species in an ecosystem into a network known as the food web. Theoretical analyses of trophic food webs, which are parameterised using diet composition data, offer useful tools to explore food web structure and operation. However, limitations in diet data can cause uncertainty in subsequent food web analyses. Therefore, this thesis had two aims: (i) to provide ecological insight into the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> food web using theoretical analyses; and (ii) to identify, explore and ameliorate {{for the effects of}} some data limitations on these analyses. Therefore, in Chapter 2, I collated a set of diet composition data for consumers in the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> and highlighted its strengths and limitations. In Chapters 3 and 4, I constructed food web analyses to draw ecological insight into the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> food web. I indicated the robustness of these conclusions to some of the assumptions I used to construct them. Finally, in Chapter 5, I constructed a probabilistic model of a penguin encountering prey to investigate changes in trophic interactions caused by the spatial and temporal variability of their prey. I show that natural variabilities, such as the spatial aggregation of prey into swarms, can explain observed foraging outcomes for this predator. Pressures caused by anthropogenically-driven changes to the earth’s climate may alter the community structure in the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea.</b> Furthermore, activities by commercial fisheries who operate in the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> are increasing, which may impact on the food web.

40|$|The <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> {{opened to}} fill the {{widening}} space created between the dominantly-westward motion of the South American plate and the dominantly-eastward motion of the South Sandwich Trench and its ancestors, as seen from Antarctica. Presently this space opens along an east-west azimuth, and is partitioned into complex transform motions on two large fault zones at the southern and northern edges of the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> and post- 17 Ma seafloor spreading in the East <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> back-arc basin {{just west of the}} trench. A patchwork of basins and extended microcontinents within the floor and margins of the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> show that, in the past, other divergent plate motions saw to the growth of much of the area west of the back-arc basin by seafloor spreading and continental extension. Two different assumptions about the tectonic history of the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> steer interpretations of these basins and microcontinents. The first is predicated on a 19 th Century view of the regional geology in which ‘the Andes are to be seen again in Graham Land’; that is, {{on the assumption that the}} <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> grew by the disruption of a compact segment of an initially-continuous convergent Antarctic-South American continental margin. The second assumes that the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> grew within the space generated by the relative motions of the major plates behind the active continental margin. The oldest remnants of the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea’s</b> growth are Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks of Tierra del Fuego and South Georgia. These rocks can be interpreted in terms of the growth of a back-arc basin, the Rocas Verdes basin, at the active continental margin of Gondwana. They are alternatively interpretable as records of basins that formed during NE-directed South American–Antarctic relative plate motions in the supercontinent interior. In Tierra del Fuego, remnants of small extensional basins with Paleogene sedimentary fills record the onset of WNW-directed motion of the South American plate at 50 Ma. Ongoing plate motion in this sense culminated in the development of a large and organised mid-ocean ridge in the west <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> expressing divergence of the South American plate from a plate overriding at the South Sandwich Trench, and the smaller Powell Basin between this overriding plate and the Antarctic plate. Magnetic anomaly records show that the West Scotia Ridge was active at 30 – 6 Ma and that the Powell Basin was opening at 30 – 22 Ma. Powell Basin has alternatively been interpreted as a back-arc basin and the west <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> as ‘back-arc in the broad sense’. A long history of interpretations concern the growth of the remainder of the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> floor, in the small Protector, Dove and Scan basins and the central <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> at the same time as spreading on the West Scotia Ridge. They are constrained by short sequences of magnetic polarity reversal anomalies, which can be modelled to show changes in spreading rate at the same times as changes in the more complete west Scotia sequence of reversal anomalies. Interpretations like these require a complex circuit of small plates in the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> after 30 Ma, a state that is suggested to have been driven by a similarly complex pattern of trench migration with both northerly and southeasterly components away from the northern and southern edges of the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea.</b> More recent interpretations of these basins are tectonically simpler, taking as their starting point knowledge of the bounding major plate motions. They fall into two time categories. In the younger category, the smaller basins are related to relative motions between an east-moving (and much slower) trench, and the South American plate. Their growth happens to accommodate regional plate divergence that was ongoing in the period between the development of Paleogene continental extensional basins in Tierra del Fuego and the 30 Ma onset of spreading at the West Scotia Ridge. In the older category, the central <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> is related to N-S directed Jurassic–Cretaceous divergence of the South American and Antarctic plates in Gondwana breakup and subsequent excision from the South American plate by development of the South Sandwich Trench at a collision zone between oceanic floor of that plate and the continental Antarctic Peninsula...|$|R

The <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> is an outstanding example of back-arc spreading, which is revealed in some detail by free-air gravity anomaly maps derived from the latest release of data acquired south of 30 °S [2]. Sea surface height data for this region {{have been reduced to}} a grid of free-air gravity anomalies, and are illustrated here by means of colour shaded relief and contour maps. The new data confirm the existence of a number of inactive spreading ridges within the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> and surrounding small basins. The amplitudes and wavelengths of gravity anomalies over these ridges conform, in general, to the expected relationship with spreading rate, except in the central <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> where a proposed Miocene slow-spreading ridge appears to have left no clear signature. The spreading ridge axis in the east <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> comprises seven or more segments, separated by small, mainly sinistral, offsets and exhibits a median valley with depths of 200 – 1000 m that is reflected in free-air lows of 10 – 40 mGal. Near both its northern and southern termini, the gravity signature of the ridge becomes less distinct, with a less pronounced axial low. The northernmost segments of the ridge are displaced in a right-lateral sense by a feature which appears to represent a southward migrating non-transform offset.

After breakup, the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> developed from several spreading centers that produced ocean basins. Five main seismic units are identified in the Cenozoic sedimentary section. The three youngest units exhibit similar seismic facies and are correlated at regional scale. These deposits contain a variety of contourite drifts resulting from the interplay between the northeastward flow of the Weddell Sea Deep Water, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the complex bathymetry.

The premise here is that the current krill-regime inthe <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> must be understood as a complex adaptive system (CAS) of social, ecologicaland economical attributes that operates over different temporal and spatial scales. Thus, byapplying the framework of a social-ecological system (SES), together with the adaptive cycleheuristic model, both quantitative and qualitative data is revised and integrated. Two alternatemanagement states are identified within the krill-regime; an early krill fishery state (1972 – 1991), and an ecosystem based governance state (1991 - 2010). Resilience is however fadingin the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> due to a combination of cross-scale attributes, in a range from low krilldensity (n/m¯²), increased competition for marine resources between predators and krillfishery, to elevated demand and global market prices of non-food commodities by theaquaculture sector in Asia, thus, moving the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> towards an unknown fish-regime.

40|$|Summary The Scan Basin {{is a small}} oceanic basin {{located in}} the {{southern}} central <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> north of the Bruce Passage (BP) which represents the main gateway between the Weddell <b>Sea</b> and the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea.</b> A seismic stratigraphic analysis {{has been carried out}} on multichannel seismic reflection profiles to determine the Miocene to present evolution of the basin. Five seismic units are identified. The oldest unit (Sc 5) was deposited during seafloor spreading in the Scan Basin. The upper four units represent the post-spreading deposits and show three major evolutionary stages: A) pre-BP opening (unit Sc- 4); B) BP opening (units Sc 3 and Sc 2) and C) post-BP opening (unit Sc 1). Stage B occurred once the BP was deep enough to allow Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW) into the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea.</b> This {{led to the development of}} large, northwards-migrating contourite drifts. Stage C developed during the present-day sinistral transcurrent compressive regime...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Four Ostracoda species {{belonging}} to one family, Halocyprididae, {{were found in}} plankton material collected from the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> and off the King George Island (the Ant− arctic) during the austral summer 1988 / 1989. Alacia belgicae, A. hettacra and Meta− conchoecia isocheira were dominant making up to nearly 99 % of all Ostracoda. The hori− zontal distribution was modified by variability of hydrological conditions. The higher con− centrations of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton, which {{were found in the}} mid − and eastern parts of the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> coincided with the highest densities of Ostracoda. The influence of ice pack presence in the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> upon the higher abundance of Ostracoda in the period in− vestigated in comparison with the earlier studies was distinctive. A vertical distribution analysis confirmed that the three above−mentioned endemic species were most abundant in the mesopelagial. The population structures of A. belgicae, A. hettacra, and M. isocheira were analysed. The presence of the youngest stage of A. belgicae in the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> con− firmed the beginning of reproduction of this species at that time. The vertical distribution patterns of A. hettacra and M. isocheira populations were similar, although their age struc− tures in comparison with A. belgicae differ significantly. This was consistent with their higher “mean population stage ” values. Key words: Antarctic, pelagic Ostracoda, vertical distribution, horizontal distribution, population structure...|$|R
40|$|A minimum-complexity tectonic reconstruction, {{based on}} {{published}} and new basin opening models, depicts how the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> grew by Cenozoic plate divergence, dismembering a Jurassic sheared margin of Gondwana. Part of the Jurassic–early Cretaceous ocean that accreted to this margin forms {{the core of}} the Central Scotia Plate, the arc plate above a trench at the eastern end of the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> which migrated east away from the Antarctic and South American plates. A sequence of extensional basins opened on {{the western edge of the}} Central Scotia Plate at 50 – 30 Ma, decoupled from the South American Plate to the northwest by slow motion on a long transform fault. Succeeding the basins, seafloor spreading started around 30 Ma on the West Scotia Ridge, which propagated northwards in the 23 – 17 Ma period and ceased to operate at 6 Ma. The circuits of plate motions inside and out- side the Scotia Arc are joined via rotations that describe Antarctic–Central Scotia plate motion in Powell Basin until 20 Ma, and along the South Scotia Ridge thereafter. The modelled relative motion at the northern edge of the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> is thus constrained only by the plate circuit, but nonetheless resembles that known coarsely from the geological record of Tierra del Fuego. A paleobathymetric interpretation of nine time slices in the model shows Drake Passage developing as an intermediate-depth oceanographic gateway at 50 – 30 Ma, with deep flow possible afterwards. Initially, this deep flow would have been made tortuous by numerous intermedi- ate and shallow barriers. A frontal pattern resembling that in the modern <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> would have awaited the clearance of significant barriers by continuing seafloor spreading in the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> at ~ 18. 5 Ma, at Shag Rocks Passage, and after 10 Ma southeast of South Georgia...|$|R
40|$|Deep sea sediments in the Weddell <b>Sea</b> and <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> collectively record ca. 147 {{million years}} of {{interaction}} between ocean bottom circulation and increased sediment supply before, and after, the first Antarctic ice sheets advanced to the shelf edge. Seismic stratigraphy is a useful tool to decipher past and present dynamics of the Antarctic ice sheets, but existing Weddell <b>Sea</b> – <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea</b> stratigraphic correlations only use sections of seismic reflection profiles and trace reflectors locally. In order to map the regional stratigraphy, we constructed the first continuous, ca. 5000 km long, seismic transect from 25 multichannel seismic reflection profiles in the Antarctic Seismic Data Library System. The transect starts in the south-eastern Weddell Sea, crosses the Powell Basin near the Antarctic Peninsula, and ends in the western <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea.</b> We mapped six major, continuous, high amplitude reflectors and interpret these unconformities to represent depositional processes related to pre-glacial, transitional and glacial regimes. Basement ages from published regional magnetic anomaly data, and ODP boreholes in the Weddell Sea and Antarctic Peninsula, provided sparse chrono-stratigraphic control. Our {{results are consistent with}} stratigraphic models in the <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea,</b> but lower horizons in the south-eastern Weddell Sea are re-interpreted. Interestingly reflector WS- 4, interpreted to represent the transition from pre-glacial to glacial regime, correlates to the Eocene/Oligocene boundary in the south-eastern Weddell Sea (34 Ma, chron C 13), but to the middle to late Miocene (12. 6 Ma, chron C 5 A) near the Antarctic Peninsula and <b>Scotia</b> <b>Sea.</b> Regional age variation of a reflector indicates the extent and duration of the depositional process and as such, our model suggests sediment supply to the deep Weddell Sea increased from east to west, in response to the advancement of the East Antarctic ice sheet, followed by the West Antarctic ice sheet and late Miocene Antarctic Peninsula ice sheet development...|$|R
