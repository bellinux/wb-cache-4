5|$|A closed {{low-level}} circulation nearly {{developed on}} August 14 {{to the east}} of Key Largo, Florida, but it weakened due to the deep convection remaining to the north over the mid-level center. The mid-level storm continued westward and moved across Florida. After crossing Florida, Hurricane Hunters indicated a poorly defined circulation, but with winds exceeding tropical storm <b>strength,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> system was designated as Tropical Storm Erika late on August 14 while located 85miles (135km) west of Fort Myers.|$|E
5|$|A northwestward moving {{tropical}} wave {{moved out}} the Caribbean Sea on September 1 {{and became a}} tropical depression on September 2 after crossing southern Florida. Still moving northwestward, the tropical depression made landfall in southeastern Louisiana on September 4. A building high pressure system over the Central United States forced the tropical depression to move southwest over the Gulf of Mexico. The warm waters then cause the depression to reach tropical storm <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> storm was given the name Fern by the National Hurricane Center on September 7.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
40|$|New Lagrangians, {{depending}} on <b>the</b> field <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> electric <b>and</b> magnetic sources are found, {{which lead to}} the Maxwell equations. One new feature is that the equations of motion are obtained by varying the Lagrangian with respect to both <b>the</b> field <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sources. In this way, conserved currents can be found for <b>the</b> field <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> electric or magnetic sources. Furthermore, using the equations of motion, the electric or magnetic sources can be eliminated, leading to conserved currents for the field strengths only (in the presence of electric and magnetic sources). Another new feature is {{the construction of a}} Lagrangian invariant under the duality transformation for both field <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> electric <b>and</b> magnetic sources. <b>The</b> conserved current, after the elimination of electric and magnetic sources, depends on the field strengths only. The conserved quantity is related to the total helicity of the electromagnetic field. Comment: 27 page...|$|R

As principal secretary, he supported exploration, colonization, the use of England's maritime <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> plantation of Ireland. He worked to bring Scotland and England together. Overall, his foreign policy demonstrated a new understanding of the role of England as a maritime, Protestant power in an increasingly global economy. He oversaw operations that penetrated Spanish military preparation, gathered intelligence from across Europe, disrupted a range of plots against Elizabeth and secured the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E
5|$|After Texas's annexation, Mexico broke {{diplomatic}} relations with the United States. While the United States claimed that Texas's border stretched to the Rio Grande, Mexico claimed it was the Nueces River. While the former Republic of Texas could not enforce its border claims, the United States had the military <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> political will to do so. President Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor south to the Rio Grande on January 13, 1846. A few months later Mexican troops routed an American cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the Thornton Affair starting the Mexican–American War. The first battles of the war were fought in Texas: the Siege of Fort Texas, Battle of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma. After these decisive victories, the United States invaded Mexican territory ending the fighting in Texas.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{generally}} {{toward the}} west-northwest under steering currents from a mid-level ridge to its north, Nepartak maintained its windspeeds throughout the day. With an improving appearance on satellite imagery, however, the storm gained some additional <b>strength,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> JTWC estimated 25W to have attained its first peak intensity with maximum 1‑minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) at 0000 UTC on November 16. Later that day, the JMA determined Nepartak {{to have reached}} maximum 10-minute winds of 120km/h (75mph), placing it at typhoon status. The cyclonic envelope began to ingest dry air from its surroundings, and convection began to wane, leading to slight weakening as the storm approached the island of Hainan. A shortwave trough soon cut a weakness in the mid-level ridge which had previously suppressed Nepartak to the south, allowing the cyclone to curve north and enhancing outflow over the storm. By late on November 17, a small eye feature about 19km (12mi) in diameter had formed, and at 0000 UTC {{the next day it}} was situated just offshore southwestern Hainan.|$|E
5|$|In Greek folklore, a stikhio (στοιχείο) was {{a spirit}} that {{protected}} his territory against the adverse stikhio spirits from other territories. In Albanian tradition, a dragoi was a dragon-man with enormous <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> power to fly; {{he was born}} with a caul. He saved his region from a kuçedra or kulshedra, a female serpentine demon. In Romanian folklore, there were no defenders against bad weather, which was produced by a gigantic flying serpentine creature called a balaur or a zmeu. A balaur could be controlled by an evil sorcerer called a şolomonar, who was able to ride on that demon. The notion of a şolomonar named a vîlva, who protected his village against attacks of vîlvas from other villages, was marginally encountered in some places of Romanian Banat.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, {{winds are}} often {{referred}} to according to their <b>strength,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as , gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs {{on a range of}} scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.|$|E

5|$|By 4 August, a {{perimeter}} {{was established}} around Pusan {{on the hills}} {{to the north of}} the city and the Naktong River to the west. The Eighth Army, including the 24th Infantry Division, was cornered by the surrounding North Korean army. With UN forces concentrated and North Korean supply lines stretched out, the 24th Infantry Division halted the advance of the North Koreans. The 24th Division was at Naktong, with the 25th Infantry Division to the south, and the 1st Cavalry Division and South Korean forces to the north. The 24th Division was also reinforced by the 2nd Infantry Division, newly arrived in the theater. The 24th was quickly sent to block the North Korean 6th Infantry Division, which attempted to attack the UN forces from the southwest. On 8 August, the North Korean 4th Infantry Division crossed the river and attempted to penetrate the perimeter. After 10 days of fighting, the 24th Infantry Division counterattacked and forced the North Koreans back across the river. By late August 1950, only 184 of the 34th Regiment's original 1,898 men remained. The regiment was dissolved and was replaced within the 24th by the 5th Regimental Combat Team. The 34th Regiment's survivors were added to the ranks of the 19th and 21st regiments in an effort to bring them up to <b>strength,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 5th Infantry remained with the 24th Division until the division withdrew from Korea. Elements of the 24th Infantry Division were moved into reserve on 23 August and replaced by the 2nd Infantry Division.
