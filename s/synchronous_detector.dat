50|$|There {{are several}} ways of {{demodulation}} depending on how parameters of the base-band signal such as amplitude, frequency or phase are transmitted in the carrier signal. For example, for a signal modulated with a linear modulation like AM (amplitude modulation), we can use a <b>synchronous</b> <b>detector.</b> On the other hand, for a signal modulated with an angular modulation, we must use an FM (frequency modulation) demodulator or a PM (phase modulation) demodulator. Different kinds of circuits perform these functions.|$|E
50|$|When {{the core}} is {{displaced}} toward the top, the voltage {{in the top}} secondary coil increases as the voltage in the bottom decreases. The resulting output voltage increases from zero. This voltage is in phase with the primary voltage. When the core moves in the other direction, the output voltage also increases from zero, but its phase is opposite {{to that of the}} primary. The phase of the output voltage determines the direction of the displacement (up or down) and amplitude indicates the amount of displacement. A <b>synchronous</b> <b>detector</b> can determine a signed output voltage that relates to the displacement.|$|E
50|$|One {{powerful}} technique involves {{moving the}} signal {{of interest to}} a higher frequency and using a phase-sensitive detector to measure it. For example, the signal of interest can be chopped with a frequency. Now the signal chain carries an AC, not DC, signal. Accordingly, you can filter out the DC by using AC-coupled stages. This filtering of DC also attenuates the flicker noise. You then use a <b>synchronous</b> <b>detector</b> that samples the peaks of the AC signal, which are equivalent to the original DC value. In other words, first low-frequency signal is shifted to high frequency by multiplying it with high-frequency carrier, and it {{is given to the}} device affected by the flicker noise. The output of the device is again multiplied with the same carrier, so the previous information signal comes back to baseband, and flicker noise will be shifted to higher frequency, which can easily be filtered out.|$|E

30|$|Both {{envelope}} and homodyne detection techniques are simple and reliable demodulation techniques. The {{problem with the}} envelope detector is that its performance {{is limited by the}} relative amplitudes of the signal being demodulated. One of the goals of this paper was to make a system more sensitive than the system based on envelope <b>detectors.</b> <b>Synchronous</b> <b>detectors</b> are more complex than envelope detectors, and they require a phase-locked loop and a mixer. Demodulation is performed by multiplying the received signal by a sine wave that is phase-locked to the incoming carrier.|$|R
5000|$|Amplitude {{modulation}} of {{a carrier}} signal normally results in two mirror-image sidebands. The signal components above the carrier frequency constitute the upper sideband (USB), and those below the carrier frequency constitute the lower sideband (LSB). For example, if a 900 kHz carrier is amplitude modulated by a 1 kHz audio signal, {{there will be}} components at 899 kHz and 901 kHz as well as 900 kHz in the generated Radio Frequency spectrum; so an audio bandwidth of (say) 7 kHz will require a radio spectrum bandwidth of 14 kHz. In conventional AM transmission, as used by [...] "Broadcast Band" [...] AM stations, the original audio signal can be recovered ("detected") by either <b>synchronous</b> <b>detector</b> circuits or by simple envelope detectors because the carrier and both sidebands are present. This is sometimes called double sideband amplitude modulation (DSB-AM), but not all variants of DSB are compatible with envelope detectors.|$|E

40|$|Using VLF frequencies, {{transmitted}} by the Navy`s network, for airborne remote sensing of the earth`s electrical, magnetic characteristics was first {{considered by the}} United States Geological Survey (USGS) around the mid 1970 s. The first VLF system was designed and developed by the USGS for installation and operation on a single engine, fixed wing aircraft used by the Branch of Geophysics for geophysical surveying. The system consisted of five channels. Two E-field channels with sensors consisting of a fixed vertical loaded dipole antenna with pre-amp mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and a gyro stabilized horizontal loaded dipole antenna with pre-amp mounted on a tail boom. The three channel magnetic sensor consisted of three orthogonal coils mounted on the same gyro stabilized platform as the horizontal E-field antenna. The main features of the VLF receiver were: narrow band-width frequency selection using crystal filters, phase shifters for zeroing out system phase variances, phase-lock loops for generating real and quadrature gates, and <b>synchronous</b> <b>detectors</b> for generating real and quadrature outputs. In the mid 1990 s the Branch of Geophysics designed and developed a two-channel E-field ground portable VLF system. The system was built using state-of-the-art circuit components and new concepts in circuit architecture. Small size, light weight, low power, durability, and reliability were key considerations {{in the design of the}} instrument. The primary purpose of the instrument was for collecting VLF data during ground surveys over small grid areas. Later the system was modified for installation on a Unmanned Airborne Vehicle (UAV).

40|$|This project {{developed}} an analog correlating spectrometer {{intended for use}} in millimeter Astronomy. It is {{based in part on}} the Wideband Analog Spectrometers (WASP and WASP-II) built by Harris, et al (See Harris, et al, (1998), and Harris and Zmuidzinas, (2001)). Like WASP, we use tapped microstrip traces etched on a circuit board as delay lines to produce the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the incoming signal. We then get the spectrum by taking the Fourier Transform of the ACF. ^ A major innovation of our design is the use of a single delay line (per segment) where the signal to be analyzed is launched on to the same delay line from either end. We produce the discrete autocorrelation function of the incoming signal via resistive taps coupled to detector diodes. Multiplication of the signals from each end is accomplished using the detector diode characteristics, along with phase switches and <b>synchronous</b> <b>detectors,</b> eliminating the need for expensive Gilbert Cell multipliers. ^ We designed, built, and tested a complete prototype system with a bandwidth of 6. 7 GHz and a resolution of 31 MHz. In this work we describe the detailed design, operation and performance of the prototype spectrometer. ^ The work culminated with the observation of several nearby galaxies; M 82, NGC 253, IC 342 and NGC 1068 as well as Sagittarius B 2 and Venus, using the prototype spectrometer. We used the FCRAO 14 meter radio telescope with the SEQUOIA receiver, which covers from 85 to 115. 5 GHz.

40|$|International audienceThe near-carrier noise {{around the}} {{longitudinal}} mechanical resonance of a magnetoelectric laminated composite has been investigated. By simultaneously applying a high-frequency electric field across the piezoelectric phase, the sensor response to low-frequency magnetic signals can be shifted around the "carrier" frequency as side band modulation signals. This magnetoelectric response can appear either as an electric charge via piezoelectric-to-piezoelectric (PP) modulation effects or as a magnetic signal via piezoelectric-to-magnetic (PM) modulation effects. These two signals are detected either with a charge preamplifier {{or with a}} coil surrounding the sample and the low-frequency sensor response to the applied magnetic field can be recovered by using two independent <b>synchronous</b> <b>detectors.</b> We have designed an experimental setup to observe the direct (passive) low-frequency noise and the noise corresponding to the two above modulations. Noise cross-correlating measurements were also carried out to investigate {{the origin of the}} near-carrier noise. No noise coherence was found between the direct low-frequency noise and the noise resulting from either the PP or the PM modulations. However, a noise coherence factor of more than 50 % has been found between the signals recovered from the two modulation techniques. A simple model has been used to explain this effect. The magnetoelectric sensor is considered as a nonlinear forced vibration system. Noise sources passing through such a system can be amplified and distributed around the carriers as side band noise where it hampers the equivalent magnetic noise performance. Electronic-thermal noise caused by dielectric dissipations in the piezoelectric phase can be considered as a noise source with a negligible contribution to the total noise floor. Mechanical-thermal low-frequency excess noise is found to be the only intrinsic noise source which is filtered by the nonlinear ME system and is present as an output n- ar-carrier noise which dominates the noise level after the demodulation processe...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{communications}} system which uses a combination of single and double- sideband techniques. Audio intelligence information is transmitted via single sideband and a single frequency tone is transmitted via double sideband to provide a means of carrier- frequency reinsertion at the receiving terminal. This system provides the power and spectrum conservation achieved by single-sideband techniques, and the means of obtaining the proper frequency for carrier reinsertion at the receiver which can be obtained by synchronous reception of the double- sideband information. The carrier frequency, which is common to both the single and doublesideband signals during the generation process at the transmitter, is suppressed to the fullest possible extent prior to the actual transmission of the sidebands. Use of a narrow bandwidth filter for the double sidebands at the receiver allows the synchronizing tone to be transmitted at a level much lower than that of the intelligence-bearing single sideband, providing economy of transmitted power. The inherent automatic-frequency-control feature of the <b>synchronous</b> <b>detector</b> allows system frequency stability requirements to be lessened, and provides rapid frequency correction to overcome Doppler frequency shifts.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} phase-noise {{measurement}} methods in which correlation and averaging {{is used to}} reject the background noise of the instrument. All the known methods make use of a mixer, used either as a saturated phase detector or as a linear <b>synchronous</b> <b>detector.</b> Unfortunately, AM noise is taken in through the power-to-dc-offset conversion mechanism that results from the mixer asymmetry. The measurement of some mixers indicates that the unwanted amplitude-to-voltage gain is {{of the order of}} 5 - 50 mV, which is 12 - 35 dB lower than the phase-to-voltage gain of the mixer. In addition, the trick of setting the mixer at a sweet point [...] off the quadrature condition [...] where the sensitivity to AM nulls, works only with microwave mixers. The HF-VHF mixers have not this sweet point. Moreover, we prove that if the AM noise comes from the oscillator under test, it can not be rejected by correlation. At least not with the schemes currently used. An example shows that at some critical frequencies the unwanted effect of AM noise is of the same order [...] if not greater [...] than the phase noise. Thus, experimental mistakes are around the corner. Comment: 16 pages, list of symbols, 8 figures, 27 reference...|$|E
