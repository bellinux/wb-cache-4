40|$|Abstract:- Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) defines common {{interfaces}} to server‟s hardware {{that used}} to monitor a server‟s physical health such as fans, voltage, temperature, power supplies, power status, and chassis. The server‟s physical health gets report to Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) by different sensors that built into the system. All the sensors information is provided by Sensor Data Records (SDRs). SDRs provide the data records that contain information about the type and number of sensors in the platform, sensor threshold <b>support,</b> <b>chassis</b> intrusion, power supply monitoring, fan speeds, fan presence, board voltages, board temperatures, bus errors, memory errors. SDR are created manually by the users using the information provided by Configuration sheet. In this paper the need to automate the generation of SDR is discussed in two ways: the SDR mapping to the spreadsheets and provided the details without spreadsheets. This paper proposed a solution by implementing of the SDR creation automation tool. We proposed a prototype including an implementation of IPMI‟s Sensor Data Records format module that {{has been applied to}} different configuration sheet provided by different engineers. Any changes to the configuration sheet values get updated by using the SDR generation tool. Keywords:- Baseboard Management controller, Field Replacement U nit, IPMI, sensors I...|$|E

40|$|Safety and security, and unifying {{these two}} aspects are {{important}} when eliciting requirements form both new and existing computer systems. As a mens to <b>support</b> this, the <b>CHASSIS</b> method was developed. With this a new issure emerged: {{a need for}} a computer tool <b>supporting</b> <b>CHASSIS</b> during requirement elicitation. This report presents an inital approach to a tool for CHASSIS. Included in the report are CHASSIS' background, related safety and security techniques and their limitations compared to CHASSIS. Further on, different approximations to a CHASSIS tool are presented resulting from industry input. The background, related techniques and input together form a proposed solution. The report continues presenting requirements of the tool as well as how these where implemented programmatically. An investigation of the tool and its abilities to fulfil the stated functional and non-functional requirements was carried out through a student experiment. The results of the experiments and other techniques utilised during the project is then evaluated and validated. A short summary and notes on further work concludes the report...|$|R

Second, the stress distribution and displacement of the chassis in the no-loaded and full-loaded conditions were calculated by meshing，applying loads and constraining boundary conditions.

50|$|The name {{blade server}} {{appeared}} when a card included the processor, memory, I/O and non-volatile program storage (flash memory or small hard disk(s)). This allowed manufacturers to package a complete server, with its operating system and applications, {{on a single}} card / board / blade. These blades could then operate independently within a common chassis, doing the work of multiple separate server boxes more efficiently. In addition to the most obvious benefit of this packaging (less space consumption), additional efficiency benefits have become clear in power, cooling, management, and networking due to the pooling or sharing of common infrastructure to <b>support</b> the entire <b>chassis,</b> rather than providing each of these on a per server box basis.|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the achievements of}} the Master Thesis Work that has made at Volvo Truck Corporation. The task consists in developing a subframe that will be fitted on a rigid truck able to carry 20 feet ISO-Containers. The main purpose of the subframe is to <b>support</b> the truck <b>chassis</b> while attaching the container by lock members mounted on the subframe. The design criteria for the subframe are that the construction should prevent rattling, limit high torsion to the chassis, and withstand the forces created from a fully loaded container. The result of the thesis consists in four different solutions, two of which grew from a totally new design, while the other two are based on design ideas from an already existing solution used at Volvo Trucks for carrying swap bodies. The recommendation for the future is to choose for further develop the design concept based on the existing solution for swap bodies as a first step. In the next phase the concept based on totally new design should be fully developed and analysed from manufacturing aspects...|$|R
40|$|Uncertainty is an {{important}} design constraint when configuring a dynamic mechanical system that is subject to passive or active vibration reduction. Uncertainty {{can be divided into}} the categories unknown, estimated and stochastic uncertainty depending on the amount of information, e. g. of the principal mechanical parameter’s deviation in inertia, energy dissipation, compliance and today more and more with active energy feeding to enhance damping. In this paper, these uncertainty categories as well as solutions for uncertainty control in the early design phase will be described and evaluated analytically in a simple but consistent and transparent way {{on the basis of a}} mathematical dynamic linear model. The model is a one degree of freedom mass-damper-spring system representing a suspension leg <b>supporting</b> a vehicle’s <b>chassis</b> that is subject to passive and active damping. The amplitude and phase responses in frequency domain are shown analytically in case studies for different assumptions of the effective uncertainty. Amongst others, sample tests are conducted by Monte Carlo Simulations when stochastic uncertainty is considered. The uncertainty examinations on vibration reduction for the selected dynamical model show promising results indicating the predominance of active damping vs. passive damping statistically...|$|R
