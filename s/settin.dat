50|$|The first {{evacuation}} {{occurred on}} 29 January 1945 in blizzard conditions. The count {{was held up}} {{the morning of the}} march as the MOC (Man of Confidence) was in negotiation with the Kommandant {{for the safety of the}} men who were too sick for the march. Many of the sick and infirmed were left behind in the Lazzarett (camp clinic) and were transported by rail or truck at a later date. Almost a thousand men struggled into formation. There were about five-hundred Russians, two-hundred Frenchmen, one-hundred Americans and twenty-five Canadians in the march. Other reports have the number at as many as two-thousand in the column. They were marched twenty-five or thirty kilometers that day. Then were put into a barn, under guard, and slept for the night. Every evening the guards would dump out the meal for the day on the muddy earth. Everyone would scramble for what they could get. In the morning, they were given two slices of bread, counted, and the march began again for twenty-five or thirty kilometers until they reached the next appointed village. Those who fell to the side of the road were rumored to have been shot, but were more likely to have been loaded onto the “dead cart” at the end of the column used to carry the dead, dying, and sick all piled into the cart together and carried to the next stopping point. After two, maybe three days, the column reached <b>Settin.</b> The sick and the dead were left at <b>Settin</b> while the majority of the rest were moved on to Stalag 2A, Neubrandenberg where they arrived on 7 February 1945. The eight-day total distance of the march was 70-90 miles (120-150 Kilometers).|$|E
