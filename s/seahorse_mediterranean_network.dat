This company was absorbed into the Società per le Strade Ferrate Romane (Roman Railways) in 1865. The Lucca-Pisa line was taken over by the Adriatic Network during the reorganisation of 1885, giving it a connection from Bologna and Florence to Livorno via Lucca and Pistoia.

40|$|We {{represent}} transport {{between different}} regions of a fluid domain by flow networks, constructed from the discrete representation of the Perron-Frobenius or transfer operator associated to the fluid advection dynamics. The procedure is useful to analyze fluid dynamics in geophysical contexts, {{as illustrated by the}} construction of a flow network associated to the surface circulation in the Mediterranean sea. We use network-theory tools to analyze the flow network and gain insights into transport processes. In particular we quantitatively relate dispersion and mixing characteristics, classically quantified by Lyapunov exponents, to the degree of the network nodes. A family of network entropies is defined from the network adjacency matrix, and related to the statistics of stretching in the fluid, in particular to the Lyapunov exponent field. Finally we use a network community detection algorithm, Infomap, to partition the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>network</b> into coherent regions, i. e. areas internally well mixed, but with little fluid interchange between them.

The Lebanese Shelf Model (LSM) is a version of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM). It is nested in a coarse resolution model the Aegean Levantine Eddy Resolving Model (1 / 20 &deg; horizontal grid, 25 sigma levels), ALERMO, that covers the Eastern Mediterranean. The nesting is one way so that velocity, temperature, and salinity along the open boundaries are interpolated from the relevant coarse model variables. Numerical simulations have been carried out under climatological surface and lateral forcing. Due to the relatively small domain, the results closely follow the simulation of the intermediate model with more details especially over the narrow shelf region. Simulations reproduce main circulation features and coastal circulation characteristics over the eastern Levantine shelf.

Until 1860 Sardinia included both Savoy and Piedmont. [...] The line from Turin to Susa was inaugurated on 22 May 1854. [...] Work on the tunnel began on 31 August 1857 and was completed in September 1871. Work had begun on the line between Bussoleno and Bardonecchia in 1867 and was completed {{at the same time}} as the tunnel. The tunnel and line were opened on 16 October 1871. By that time, the Savoy side of the tunnel had become part of France. The decision of the engineers to begin the line at Bussoleno in order to reduce the gradient on the climb near Meana was much criticized for bypassing the city of Susa, which was left isolated on a short branch line. The opening of the tunnel also led to the closure of the Mont Cenis Pass Railway. In 1865 the line became part of the network of the Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (Upper Italian Railways, SFAI) on its foundation in 1865 and was taken over by the Rete Mediterranea (<b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Network)</b> in 1885.
