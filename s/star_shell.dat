She departed for Culebra Island on 12 May to join Admiral Mitscher's 8th Fleet in the Navy's first large-scale postwar Atlantic training maneuvers. The battleship returned to New York City on 27 May, {{and spent the}} next year steaming Atlantic coastal waters north to the Davis Strait and south to the Caribbean on various Atlantic command training exercises.

The Germans had better {{searchlight}} control, using iris shutters which could rapidly switch {{on and off}} the light, <b>star</b> <b>shell</b> which could be fired over enemy ships to illuminate them without having to use a searchlight, which automatically presented a target for return fire. They used a system of coloured lights for recognition signals between ships, which the British could not duplicate, whereas the British used plain flashed morse signals, which the Germans were partly able to copy after once seeing them, giving some advantage when ships met. Scheer determined that his best chance was to pass the British fleet during the night.|$|E

500|$|Just {{before midnight}} on 15 April, [...] made radar contact with U-1235 at a {{position}} about [...] north of Flores Island. She immediately attacked the submarine with her hedgehog anti-submarine mortar, but the submarine submerged and escaped. Assisted by , Stanton quickly gained sonar {{contact with the}} submarine and made three more hedgehog attacks. The third attack, which was conducted at 00:33 on 16 April, sank the submarine {{with the loss of}} her entire crew. Shortly afterwards Frost detected U-880 by radar as she attempted to flee the area on the surface. After illuminating the submarine with <b>star</b> <b>shell</b> and spotlights, the destroyer escort opened fire on her with Bofors 40 mm guns from a range of [...] at 02:09. U-880 quickly submerged but was tracked by Stantons and Frosts sonar operators. The two American ships made several hedgehog attacks on the submarine, with Stanton sinking her with no survivors at 04:04. [...] Both submarines suffered huge explosions after being struck by hedgehog projectiles. This further raised the fear that they were carrying rockets and motivated the First Barrier Force to intensify its efforts to destroy the remaining U-boats.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Force 2, {{comprising}} Duke of York, the [...] light cruiser , {{and four}} destroyers (the [...] , , and , and the Norwegian destroyer [...] ), was closing, {{and it was}} estimated that a night action with Scharnhorst would commence around 1715. But Scharnhorst altered course, and Belfast regained radar contact, passing it to Force 2. Duke of York made her initial radar contact at 1617, at a distance of , and Force 2 began to manoeuvre for broadside fire and torpedo runs by the destroyers. Belfast fired star shells at 1648 to illuminate Scharnhorst, followed by another <b>star</b> <b>shell</b> from one of Duke of Yorks [...] guns, taking Scharnhorst by surprise with her main battery trained fore and aft. By 1650, Duke of York had closed to less than [...] and opened fire with a full 10-gun broadside, scoring one hit. Although under heavy fire, Scharnhorsts return fire straddled Duke of York a number of times and hit her twice. A [...] shell passed through the mainmast and its port leg without detonating, but fragments from the hit destroyed the cable for the main search radar. A [...] shell also pierced the port strut of the foremast without exploding. At 1655, a [...] shell from Duke of York silenced Scharnhorsts forward main battery turrets Anton and Bruno, but she maintained speed so that by 1824 the range had opened to , when Duke of York ceased fire after expending fifty-two broadsides. However, one shell from the final salvoes pierced Scharnhorsts armour belt and destroyed her No. 1 boiler room, slowing the ship and allowing the pursuing British destroyers to overtake her.|$|E
2500|$|The four LCAs {{approaching}} Quiberville {{were observed}} from shore and illuminated by <b>star</b> <b>shell</b> at 04:53, {{just as they}} were making their final run in to touch down.

50|$|Similar to {{incendiary}} <b>shells</b> were <b>star</b> <b>shells,</b> {{designed for}} illumination rather than arson.

2500|$|On {{hearing the}} Dinaric explosion, Drummondville raced towards the sinking ship, firing a <b>star</b> <b>shell.</b> U-162 {{was caught in}} the illumination. Drummondville moved to ram the submarine, with U-162 not diving until the {{minesweeper}} was almost on top of it. Drummondville dropped three depth charges over the diving submarine. As U-162 dived, the submarine encountered a variable density layer within the water, keeping the submarine from dropping to a safe depth. Drummondville turned to ram again, but this time the submarine began to sink faster. This was a result of Vogelsang opening his forward torpedo tubes in order to decrease the submarine's buoyancy. Drummondville dropped three more depth charges, exacerbating the damage caused earlier in U-162s patrol. The main line for the operation of the buoyancy tanks had been severed causing the submarine to sink to , near crush depth for U-162. Efforts aboard the submarine to rise to a safer depth failed and the submarine remained near [...] below the surface. To reach the surface, Vogelsang blew out his buoyancy tanks. The submarine reached the surface and fled the area at [...] using its diesel engines. Drummondville meanwhile had been attempting to gather the merchants into a convoy again against what he believed to be the threat of a second submarine. At 03:30, the noise from U-162s diesels was picked up by Drummondvilles asdic. Drummondville sped towards the contact and fired <b>star</b> <b>shell,</b> finding nothing with U-162 just beyond range of the illumination. The minesweeper dropped depth charges before returning to the merchant vessels.|$|E
2500|$|After {{completing}} refit, Tobruk {{operated in}} the waters of Australia and New Guinea until mid 1955, when she joined several RAN ships in a deployment to South East Asia. In 1956, she was assigned to the Far East Strategic Reserve. A further deployment was made in 1957, during which Tobruk was involved in the Malayan Emergency; this was later recognised with a second battle honour: [...] "Malaya 1957". On 26 April, during night exercises, a <b>star</b> <b>shell</b> fired by [...] landed in one of Tobruks gun bays, killing one sailor and severely wounding another. The destroyer's third and final assignment to the Strategic Reserve occurred during 1959. After a refit during early 1960, Tobruk and several other RAN ships made port visits to Nouméa and New Guinea.|$|E
2500|$|ONS 5 {{found itself}} making less than 3 knots headway into a Force 10 gale. The convoy {{started to be}} scattered, some ships ending up 30 miles from the convoy, and the escorts were kept busy {{rounding}} up stragglers. Oribi was able to refuel from the convoy oiler when the storm abated briefly on the 30th before the weather again made re-fuelling impossible, {{and a number of}} the destroyers became so low on fuel as to throw doubt on whether they could continue. At 2305 Snowflake made a radar contact at [...] and dropped a single depth charge after the U-boat dived when illuminated by <b>star</b> <b>shell.</b> The escorts dropped some random depth charges until dawn, and Admiral Dönitz cancelled the chase on the evening of 1 May.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 June 1942, Express sailed from Bombay, India, for Cape Town, South Africa, with a {{cargo of}} {{manganese}} ore, jute, leather, and other goods. At 00:30 on 30 June, while navigating almost due south on a zig-zag course near position , a <b>star</b> <b>shell</b> fired by [...] illuminated {{the sky at}} almost {{the same time that}} two torpedoes from the same submarine hit their mark on Express. The first torpedo struck the cargo ship at waterline on the starboard side near the no. 7 hatch. The second torpedo, which hit five seconds after the first, hit at the no. 5 hatch. The explosions blew off the hatch covers, knocked out the guns, and destroyed the radio, preventing a distress call. The ship began sinking by the stern almost immediately, and the officers, crew, and Naval Armed Guard detachment took to the lifeboats. Because Express was still underway even while sinking, two of the three boats launched were swamped; the thirteen men aboard the no. 1 boat, one of the pair swamped, all drowned. The no. 2 boat, with 41 men aboard, made landfall on the coast of Mozambique six days after the sinking. Another crewman—who had originally been on a life raft, but moved to a water-filled lifeboat—was rescued by a Dutch tanker and landed at Cape Town.|$|E

60|$|The fire of the British was, however, crushing. Their {{discipline}} was admirable, and {{the terrible}} weapon {{with which they}} were armed, with its more terrible bullet, stopped every rush. The soldiers, confident in their power, were under perfect control. When the enemy charged, the order to employ magazine fire was passed along the ranks. The guns fired <b>star</b> <b>shell.</b> These great rockets, bursting into stars in the air, slowly fell to the ground shedding a pale and ghastly light on the swarming figures of the tribesmen as they ran swiftly forward. Then the popping of the musketry became one intense roar as the ten cartridges, which the magazine of the rifle holds, were discharged almost instantaneously. Nothing could live in front of such a fire. Valour, ferocity, fanaticism, availed nothing. All were swept away. The whistles sounded. The independent firing stopped, with machine-like precision, and the steady section volleys were resumed. This happened not once, but a dozen times during the six hours that the attack was maintained. The 20th Punjaub Infantry, and the cavalry also, sustained and repulsed the attacks delivered against their fronts with steadiness. At length the tribesmen sickened of the slaughter, and retired to their hills in gloom and disorder.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} Tonkin Gulf Incident in August 1964, the US Navy {{developed}} a training exercise to simulate firing on small, high-speed targets {{at night and}} Tillamook was assigned to participate off Subic Bay. Tillmook would tow the sled in one direction at top speed—just over 11 knots—while a destroyer steamed {{in the opposite direction}} at something close to top speed—something close to 30 knots—creating a relative closing speed of about 40 knots. On the first two nights, the destroyers illuminated the tow with their <b>star</b> <b>shells,</b> locked the turrets on the two, but did not fire. On several occasions, the <b>star</b> <b>shells</b> illuminated Tillamook. On the third night, a destroyer commenced a live exercise, but also placed the <b>star</b> <b>shells</b> over Tillamook rather than over the tow. Shortly thereafter, the crew on the Tillamook heard the destroyer radioman announced [...] "Shot, out"—it was on the way. A few second later, a salvo of AA Common shattered about 50-100 yards short of Tillamook—and then [...] "Shot, out" [...] again—before the crew could react, a second salvo was on the way that landed about 50-100 yards long. Although the salvos missed, shrapnel hit the side of Tillmook, and the crew collected them in a box and gave them to the destroyer as a present the following day while delivering the mail to the fleet.|$|R
