5|$|I have labored {{to make a}} {{covenant}} with myself, that affection may not press upon judgment; for I <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> is no man that hath any apprehension of gentry or nobleness, but his affection stands to the continuance of a house so illustrious, and would take hold of a twig or twine-thread to support it. And yet time hath his revolutions; {{there must be a}} period and an end to all temporal things—finis rerum—an end of names and dignities, and whatsoever is terrene; and why not of de Vere? For where is Bohun? Where is Mowbray? Where is Mortimer? Nay, which is more, and most of all, where is Plantagenet? They are entombed in the urns and sepulchres of mortality! yet let the name of de Vere stand so long as it pleaseth God.|$|E
25|$|For illustration, we will <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> is a {{smallest}} {{division of}} the good available (say 1 cent). Suppose that {{the total amount of}} money available is x.|$|E
25|$|<b>Suppose</b> <b>there</b> {{are five}} red bags, each one {{containing}} three apples. Now grabbing an empty green bag, move all the apples from all five red bags {{into the green}} bag. Now the green bag will have fifteen apples.|$|E

60|$|However, if {{the facts}} were as he had stated, I <b>supposed</b> <b>there</b> {{was nothing to be}} done about it.|$|R
25|$|<b>Suppose</b> <b>there</b> {{exists a}} {{function}} called Insert designed to insert a value into a sorted sequence {{at the beginning}} of an array. It operates by beginning {{at the end of the}} sequence and shifting each element one place to the right until a suitable position is found for the new element. The function has the side effect of overwriting the value stored immediately after the sorted sequence in the array.|$|E
25|$|Let (fn) be a {{sequence}} of M-valued measurable functions, where M is a separable metric space, on some measure space (X,Σ,μ), and <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> is a measurable subset A of finite μ-measure such that (f'n) converges μ-almost everywhere on A to a limit function f. The following result holds: for every ε>0, there exists a measurable subset B of A such that μ(B)<nbsp&ε, and (fn) converges to f uniformly on the relative complement Anbsp&\nbsp&B.|$|E
25|$|Proof. <b>Suppose</b> <b>there</b> {{exists a}} {{non-empty}} set, S, of naturals with no least element. Let P(k) be {{the assertion that}} k is not in S. Then P(0) is true for if it were false then 0 is the least element of S. Furthermore, suppose P(1), P(2),..., P(k) is true. Then if P(k+1) is false k+1 is in S, thus it is the minimal element is S, a contradiction. Thus P(k+1) is true. Therefore, by the induction axiom S is empty, a contradiction.|$|E

25|$|On further reflection, the Meditator {{realizes that}} even simple {{things can be}} doubted. Omnipotent God could make even our {{conception}} of mathematics false. One might argue that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses {{would not have been}} created by a perfect being.|$|E
25|$|Even {{if there}} were {{exceedingly}} few things in a finite space in an infinite time, {{they would not have}} to repeat in the same configurations. <b>Suppose</b> <b>there</b> were three wheels of equal size, rotating on the same axis, one point marked on the circumference of each wheel, and these three points lined up in one straight line. If the second wheel rotated twice as fast as the first, and if the speed of the third wheel was 1/π of the speed of the first, the initial line-up would never recur.|$|E
25|$|An example: <b>Suppose</b> <b>there</b> is {{a library}} {{function}} whose {{purpose is to}} parse a single syslog file entry. What should this function do if the entry is malformed? There is no one right answer, because the same library could be deployed in programs for many different purposes. In an interactive log-file browser, {{the right thing to}} do might be to return the entry unparsed, so the user can see it—but in an automated log-summarizing program, {{the right thing to do}} might be to supply null values for the unreadable fields, but abort with an error, if too many entries have been malformed.|$|E
60|$|<b>Supposing</b> <b>there</b> were a fine {{collection}} of Byzantine ivories, you would consider {{that they were}} an important link in the general history?--Certainly.|$|R

25|$|IRV has {{the effect}} of {{avoiding}} split votes when multiple candidates earn support from like-minded voters. As a simple example, <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> are two candidates with similar views, A and B, and a third with different views, C, with first-preference totals of 35% for candidate A, 25% for B and 40% for C. In a plurality voting election, candidate C may win with 40% of the votes, even though 60% of electors prefer both A and B over C. Alternatively, voters are pressured to choose the seemingly stronger candidate of either A or B, despite personal preference for the other, in order to help ensure the defeat of C. With IRV, the electors backing B as their first choice can rank A second, which means candidate A will win by 60% to 40% over C despite the split vote in first choices.|$|E
25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of {{what is really going}} on. Here is an example. <b>Suppose</b> <b>there</b> are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) turn out to be on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one expects to see more than one some of the time. The question becomes how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} above, one {{can identify}} significantly regulated genes {{first and then}} find patterns by comparing the list of significant genes to sets of genes known to share certain associations. One can also work the problem in reverse order. Here is a very simple example. <b>Suppose</b> <b>there</b> are 40 genes associated with a known process, for example, a predisposition to diabetes. Looking at two groups of expression profiles, one for mice fed a high carbohydrate diet and one for mice fed a low carbohydrate diet, one observes that all 40 diabetes genes are expressed {{at a higher level}} in the high carbohydrate group than the low carbohydrate group. Regardless of whether any of these genes would have made it to a list of significantly altered genes, observing all 40 up, and none down appears unlikely {{to be the result of}} pure chance: flipping 40 heads in a row is predicted to occur about one time in a trillion attempts using a fair coin.|$|E

500|$|Although {{originating}} roughly {{simultaneously in}} Holland, England, and France, {{it was only}} in England, and later in Ireland, that the legend became well known and widely believed. In 1861 Charles Dickens remarked on the longevity of the belief in pig-faced women in England, commenting that [...] "In every age, I <b>suppose,</b> <b>there</b> has been a pig-faced lady".|$|E
500|$|Fincher and Savides {{used the}} {{photographs}} of William Eggleston, Stephen Shore's work from the early Seventies, and actual photos from the Zodiac police files. The two men worked hard to capture {{the look and feel}} of the period as Fincher admitted, [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> could have been more VW bugs but I think what we show is a pretty good representation of the time. It is not technically perfect. There are some flaws but some are intended." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle was built in the old post office in the Terminal Annex Building in downtown Los Angeles. A building on nearby Spring Street subbed for the Hall of Justice and the San Francisco Police Department. Production began on September 12, 2005. The filmmakers shot for five weeks in the San Francisco Bay Area and the rest of the time in Los Angeles, bringing the film in under budget, wrapping in February 2006. The film took 115 days to shoot.|$|E
500|$|Following its new route, Bounty reached Cape Town on 24 May 1788. Here, Heywood wrote a {{long letter}} to his family {{describing}} the voyage to date, with vivid descriptions of life at sea. Initially, Heywood relates, sailing had been [...] "in the most pleasurable weather imaginable". In describing the attempts to round Cape Horn he writes: [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> never were seas, {{in any part of}} the known world, to compare with those we met ... for height, and length of swell; the oldest seamen on board never saw anything to equal that..." [...] Bligh's decision to turn east was, Heywood records, [...] "to the great joy of everyone on board". Historian Greg Dening records a story, unmentioned in Heywood's letter, that {{at the height of the}} Cape Horn storms Bligh had punished Heywood for some minor wrongdoing by ordering him to climb the mast and to [...] "stay there beyond the point of all endurance"; this, Dening concedes, was possibly a later fabrication to discredit Bligh.|$|E

500|$|In January 1991, {{following}} her departure from Automatic Dlamini, Harvey formed her own band with former bandmates Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver. Harvey decided {{to name the}} trio PJ Harvey after rejecting other names as [...] "nothing felt right at all or just suggested the wrong type of sound", and also {{to allow her to}} continue music as a solo artist. The trio consisted of Harvey on vocals and guitars, Ellis on drums and backing vocals, and Oliver on bass. Oliver later departed to rejoin the still-active Automatic Dlamini. He was subsequently replaced with Steve Vaughan. The trio's [...] "disastrous" [...] debut performance was held at a skittle alley in Charmouth Village Hall in April 1991. Harvey later recounted the event saying: [...] "we started playing and I <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> was about fifty people there, and during the first song we cleared the hall. There was only about two people left. And a woman came up to us, came up to my drummer, it was only a three piece, while we were playing and shouted at him 'Don't you realize nobody likes you! We'll pay you, you can stop playing, we'll still pay you!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Bellerophon {{returned}} to sea in May 1795 {{after three months}} anchored in the Solent. She had been at Spithead on 1 May, when the 98-gun [...] caught fire and blew up, with Bellerophon rescuing twelve men. Still with the Channel Fleet, she joined a squadron commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir William Cornwallis which was patrolling off Ushant. The squadron had arrived on station on 7 June, and the following day captured a convoy of eight French merchants off Belle Île. The squadron remained in the area until 16 June, when a lookout on Bellerophon spotted a large fleet to the east-south-east. This was the Brest fleet, consisting of thirteen ships of the line, two frigates, two brigs and a cutter, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse. Heavily outnumbered, Cornwallis ordered a retreat, but the Bellerophon and [...] sailed unusually slowly {{and he found himself}} being steadily overhauled by the French. Keeping his ships together, Cornwallis ordered Bellerophon to take up position at the head of his line, later explaining that [...] "The Bellerophon I was glad to keep in some measure as a reserve, having reason at first to <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> would be full occasion for the utmost exertions of us all... I considered that ship a treasure in store, having heard of her former accomplishments, and observing the spirit manifested by all on board when she passed me, joined to the zeal and activity shewed by Lord Cranstoun during the whole cruize." ...|$|E
500|$|Belle {{was also}} the main {{character}} in various comic books based on the film, including one set during Belle's stay at the castle published by Marvel Comics, and a prequel set several years before the film distributed by Disney Comics. In the former, the storylines generally have the servants trying to coax Belle into doing something with the Beast, only for it to backfire and nearly ruin their friendship before they make up. In the latter serial, Belle ends up {{locked up in a}} cellar by village children after reluctantly playing pirates with them, and later nearly goes down the path leading to Beast's castle. The latter serial also implies that she holds misandric views and refuses to associate herself with the village children, especially the males, due to their not being as well-versed in literature as she."Maurice: You should be playing outside with the other children! // Belle: I'm having a much better time in King Arthur's Court! Sometimes I can see myself living in a castle surrounded by servants. I might even entertain the thought of a handsome prince.....As long as he was gentle and kind... Not like those childish roughnecks in the square! Not one of them could even spell gallant! // Maurice: A day will come when those boys will look like knights in shining armor to you. // Belle: Never! I won't {{have anything to do with}} them. Men are such... such... // Maurice: Hear that, Pierre? According to my daughter there isn't an ounce of difference between us! // Pierre: Oink! // Belle: Well, I <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> are some exceptions." ...|$|E
