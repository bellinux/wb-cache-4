40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyze Bulygin’s {{conception}} of those legal statements asserting {{that a certain}} action is legally obligatory, prohibited or permitted. According to Bulygin, these statements are ambiguous. The can be external, empirical statements expressing the existence or validity of a legal norm, but the can also be internal, normative statements expressing a norm or an absolute, moral attitude. In the paper I attempt to defend that for a positivist theory, if law is conceived {{as a set of}} norms, this kind of statements do not report an empirical fact, but do not report an absolute moral attitude either. They <b>surely</b> <b>assert</b> a normative fact: the legal existence or validity of a normative entity, which is relative to a certain time and place. In my view, Bulygin’s failure to see this point is fundamentally due to the assumption of a false dichotomy between two ways in which an entity can exist: one empirical (relative), the other normative (absolute). In order to criticize this apparent dichotomy, I briefly sketch a constructivist conception in which we can say that legal norms exist. If my reasoning is correct, this conception is apt to explain those statements expressing the normative fact that a norm exists or is legally valid...|$|E

[...] "Can I get the money back from the man to whom it was paid at Wurzburg, when my note fell due {{on the last day}} of the old year? Do I know anybody who will lend me five {{thousand}} florins? Will my father do it? His house has been closed to me for twenty years--and my mother, who might have interceded for me, is dead. Can I appeal to the sympathy and compassion (once already refused in the hardest terms) of my merciless relatives in this city? I have appealed! I forced my way to them yesterday--I owned that I owed a sum of money which was more, far more, than I could pay. I drank the bitter cup of humiliation to the dregs--I even offered my daughter's necklace as security for a loan. Do you want to know what reply I received? The master of the house turned his back on me; the mistress told me to my face that she believed I had stolen the necklace. Was the punishment of my offense severe enough, when I heard those words? <b>Surely</b> I have <b>asserted</b> some claim to your pity, at last? I only want more time. With a few months before me--with my salary as housekeeper, and the sale of my little valuables, and the proceeds of my work for the picture-dealers--I can, and will, replace the money. You are rich. What is a loan of five thousand florins to you? Help me to pass through the terrible ordeal of your day of reckoning on the sixth of the month! Help me to see Minna married and happy! And if you still doubt my word, take the pearl necklace as security that you will suffer no loss." ...|$|R
