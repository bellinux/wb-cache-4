5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to clear up the question.|$|E

25|$|Any {{attempt to}} give an {{exhaustive}} list of the archetypes, however, would be a largely futile exercise since the archetypes tend to combine {{with each other and}} interchange qualities making it difficult to decide where one archetype stops and another begins. For example, qualities of the shadow archetype may be prominent in an archetypal image of the anima or animus. One archetype may also appear in various distinct forms, thus raising the question whether four or five distinct archetypes <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to be present or merely four or five forms of a single archetype.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century, Saint Alphonsus Liguori, a Doctor of the Church, also {{emphasized}} the need for proper devotion when praying the rosary. In The Glories of Mary he wrote that the Virgin Mary would be more pleased with five decades of the rosary said slowly with devotion than with fifteen said in a hurry and with little devotion. He recommended that the rosary <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> kneeling before {{an image of the}} Virgin Mary and before each decade to make an act of love to Jesus and Mary and ask them for a particular grace.|$|E
25|$|The Gen 75 Committee meeting {{discussed}} what <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> at the meeting, {{in particular}} what British policy towards the Soviet Union should be. Bevin took a conciliatory {{line at the}} 11 October 1945 Gen 75 Committee meeting, only to take a harder line at the one a week later, Unusually, the matter was placed before the full Cabinet. Hopes were expressed that Britain {{might be able to}} broker a deal that would head off a schism between the United States and the Soviet Union. Ultimately, though, it endorsed Attlee's preference that practical knowledge of nuclear weapons design not be shared with the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|Page 13 - Finally, a word <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for the inestimable {{value of}} the Type JR-1 relay {{operated}} battle lanterns, which were {{the only source of}} illumination after the ship's lighting system failed. The confidence that these beams of light along the exit routes maintained in the men contributed largely to the lack of panic and contributed to the saving of many lives. There were 110 of these lanterns installed throughout the ship in locations best suited for just such an emergency. This is twice the number shown in the ship's machinery allowance book. The excess was obtained through an error, but in view of this experience it is believed that the quantity of 110 is the acceptable minimum for cruisers. It is recommended that the allowance of this item for cruisers be increased accordingly and that it be increased proportionately for other types of ships.|$|E
25|$|Magnússon {{returned}} to Þeyr, {{and the band}} toured Scandinavia. By this point, Guðni and Hilmar {{decided to leave the}} band’s management, and were replaced by Guðmundur Sigurfreyr Jónason. With the tour, the band gained more popularity and even managed to appear on radio and television in Denmark, they also went to a studio and recorded a few songs which were released on the 12-inch EP The Fourth Reich, in memory of Wilhelm Reich whose books had been banned by the Nazi regime. The image cover was alleged Nazi incitation because it depicted Wilhelm Reich wearing a Nazi-styled armband and the British label Shout was obligated to change the cover. However, it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>said,</b> that the armband shown on the cover contained the symbol of the orgone physics, which represented duality and its origins in unity, referred by Reich as functionalism. On The Fourth Reich the use of percussions and rhythmical efforts were far more important than in earlier works. In this respect, the song “Zen” was particularly important due to its marked rock style, but the album did not have the impact of earlier works because the music was less accessible. The Icelandic version of this EP was released by label Mjöt, which had been created by Magnús.|$|E
25|$|For axiomatic {{treatment}} of thermodynamic equilibrium, since the 1930s, {{it has become}} customary {{to refer to a}} zeroth law of thermodynamics. The customarily stated minimalist version of such a law postulates only that all bodies, which when thermally connected would be in thermal equilibrium, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to have the same temperature by definition, but by itself does not establish temperature as a quantity expressed as a real number on a scale. A more physically informative version of such a law views empirical temperature as a chart on a hotness manifold. While the zeroth law permits the definitions of many different empirical scales of temperature, the second law of thermodynamics selects the definition of a single preferred, absolute temperature, unique up to an arbitrary scale factor, whence called the thermodynamic temperature. If internal energy is considered {{as a function of the}} volume and entropy of a homogeneous system in thermodynamic equilibrium, thermodynamic absolute temperature appears as the partial derivative of internal energy with respect the entropy at constant volume. Its natural, intrinsic origin or null point is absolute zero at which the entropy of any system is at a minimum. Although this is the lowest absolute temperature described by the model, the third law of thermodynamics postulates that absolute zero cannot be attained by any physical system.|$|E

500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review in}} the Imperial Review in November 1805 stated, [...] "something <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of the language. This undoubtedly is not its chief excellence. The style, in many places, is trailing, flat, and uninteresting,—deficient both in strength and animation. The author seldoms avails himself of any artificial ornaments [...] Though we feel ourselves compelled to make these observations, it is hardly necessary to add, that upon the whole we think very highly of this performance." [...] The review continues by comparing Madoc to Paradise Lost: [...] "were the style adorned by a little artificial colouring, and enriched with all the allowable decorations of poetry, Madoc would hardly yield to Paradise Lost. As it stands, it is certainly the second heroic production in the English language. Its leading characteristics are not fire and sublimity, but tenderness and humanity. Milton astonishes the head—Southey touches the heart. The first we may admire—the last we can love." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{characters}} are often emotionally disturbed, obsessive and morally ambiguous, facing the fears and anxieties of loneliness, guilt, jealousy, and greed; {{in addition to}} the larger themes of corruption and conspiracy. By grounding [...] "everyday neurosis – our everyday sort of fears and hopes for ourselves" [...] in a heightened reality, Nolan makes them more accessible to a universal audience. The protagonists of Nolan's films are often driven by philosophical beliefs, and their fate is ambiguous. In some of his films, the protagonist and antagonist are mirror images of each other, a point which is made to the protagonist by the antagonist. Through these clashings of ideologies, Nolan highlights the ambivalent nature of truth. The director also uses his real-life experiences as an inspiration in his work, [...] "From a creative point of view, the process of growing up, the process of maturing, getting married, having kids, I've tried to use that in my work. I've tried to just always be driven by the things that were important to me." [...] Writing for The Playlist, Oliver Lyttelton singled out parenthood as a signature theme in Nolan's work, adding; [...] "the director avoids talking about his private life, but fatherhood has been at the emotional heart of almost everything he's made, at least from Batman Begins onwards (previous films, it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>said,</b> pre-dated the birth of his kids)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{dismissals}} {{take place}} for legitimate business reasons, because the employer {{will no longer}} require staff, or maybe because times are bad and the employer {{can no longer afford}} to pay.

Among the wedding gifts the young couple received were slaves from his father and father-in-law. As Birney had yet to fully develop his abolitionist views, he accepted them kindly.
