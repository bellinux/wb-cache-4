However, the precise requirement for this structure during budding yeast cytokinesis has been controversial. Here {{we show that}} deletion <b>of</b> <b>MYO</b> 1, the single myosin II gene, is lethal in a commonly used strain background. The terminal phenotype <b>of</b> <b>myo</b> 1 Δ is interconnected chains of cells, suggestive of a cytokinesis defect. To further investigate the role <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 1 p in cytokinesis, we conditionally disrupted Myo 1 function by using either a dominant negative Myo 1 p construct or a strain where expression <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 1 p can be shut-off. Both ways <b>of</b> disruption <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 1 function result in a failure in cytokinesis. Additionally, we show that a myo 1 Δ strain previously reported to grow nearly {{as well as the}} wild type contains a single genetic suppressor that alleviates the severe cytokinesis defects <b>of</b> <b>myo</b> 1 Δ. Using fluorescence time-lapse imaging and electron microscopy techniques, we show that cytokinesis in this strain is achieved through formation of multiple aberrant septa. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the actomyosin ring is crucial for successful cytokinesis in budding yeast, but new cytokinetic mechanisms can evolve through genetic changes when myosin II function is impaired...|$|R
40|$|Signaling by {{extracellular}} signal-regulated kinase (ERK) {{plays an}} essential role in the induction of cell motility, but the precise mechanism underlying such regulation has remained elusive. We recently identified SH 3 P 2 as a negative regulator of cell motility whose function is inhibited by p 90 ribosomal S 6 kinase (RSK) -mediated phosphorylation downstream of ERK. We here show that myosin 1 E (Myo 1 E) is a binding partner of SH 3 P 2 and that the interaction of the two proteins in the cytosol prevents the localization <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 1 E to the plasma membrane. Serum-induced phosphorylation of SH 3 P 2 at Ser 202 by RSK results in dissociation <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 1 E from SH 3 P 2 in the cytosol and the subsequent localization <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 1 E to the tips of lamellipodia mediated by binding of its TH 2 domain to F-actin.

We explore {{the role of}} the neck region and its associated light chains in regulating Myo 2 p function. Surprisingly, we find that precise deletion of the six IQ sites in the neck region results in a myosin, Myo 2 -Δ 6 IQp, that can support the growth of a yeast strain at 90 % the rate of a wild-type isogenic strain. We exploit this mutant in a characterization of the light chains <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 2 p. First, we demonstrate that the localization of calmodulin to sites of polarized growth largely depends on the IQ sites in the neck <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 2 p. Second, we demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized protein, Mlc 1 p, is a myosin light chain <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 2 p. MLC 1 (YGL 106 w) is an essential gene that exhibits haploinsufficiency.

Inhibition <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 1 (by PClP) and Myo 2 (by Blebbistatin) lead to arrest in cell division.

In addition to cell division and furrow formation, inhibition <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 1 has a drastic effect on the dynamics and distribution of lipid droplets (LDs) in the blastodisc near the cleavage furrow. All these results above are effects <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 1 inhibition exclusively; Myo 2 inhibition by blebbistatin does not show such phenotypes.

40|$|Myo 2 p is a yeast class V myosin that {{functions}} in membrane trafficking. To investigate {{the function of}} the carboxyl-terminal-tail domain <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 2 p, we have overexpressed this domain behind the regulatable GAL 1 promoter (MYO 2 DN). Overexpression of the tail domain <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 2 p results in a dominant–negative phenotype that is phenotypically similar to a temperature-sensitive allele <b>of</b> <b>myo</b> 2, myo 2 – 66.

The Myo 2 p in this pellet is not solubilized by Mg++-ATP or Triton X- 100, but is solubilized by high salt. Tail overexpression does not disrupt this fractionation pattern, nor do mutations in sec 4, sec 3, sec 9, cdc 42, or myo 2. These results show that overexpression of the tail domain <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 2 p does not compete with the endogenous Myo 2 p for assembly into a pelletable structure, but does compete with the endogenous Myo 2 p for a factor that is necessary for localization to the bud tip...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{division}} {{in a number}} of eukaryotes, including the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is achieved through a medially placed actomyosin-based contractile ring. Although several components of the actomyosin ring have been identified, the mechanisms regulating ring assembly are still not understood. Here, we show by biochemical and mutational studies that the S. pombe actomyosin ring component Cdc 4 p is a light chain associated with Myo 2 p, a myosin II heavy chain. Localization <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 2 p to the medial ring depended on Cdc 4 p function, whereas localization of Cdc 4 p at the division site was independent <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 2 p. Interestingly, the actin-binding and motor domains <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 2 p are not required for its accumulation at the division site although the motor activity <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 2 p is essential for assembly of a normal actomyosin ring. The initial assembly <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 2 p and Cdc 4 p at the division site requires a functional F-actin cytoskeleton. Once established, however, F-actin is not required for the maintenance of Cdc 4 p and Myo 2 p medial rings, suggesting that the attachment of Cdc 4 p and Myo 2 p to the division site involves proteins other than actin itself...|$|R

Inactivation <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 3 A 2 IQ kinase domain with the point mutation K 50 R did not alter maximal ATPase activity, whereas phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 3 A 2 IQ resulted in reduced maximal ATPase activity and actin affinity.

Disruption <b>of</b> <b>myo</b> 4 caused a defect in cell growth and led to an abnormal accumulation of secretory vesicles throughout the cytoplasm. The mutant cells were rounder than normal, although the sites for cell polarization were still established. Elongation of the cell ends and completion of septation required more time than in wild-type cells, indicating that Myo 4 functions in polarized growth both at the cell ends and during septation. Consistent with this conclusion, Myo 4 was localized around the growing cell ends, the medial F-actin ring, and the septum as a cluster of dot structures. In living cells, the dots of green fluorescent protein-tagged Myo 4 moved rapidly around these regions. The localization and movement <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 4 were dependent on both F-actin cables and its motor activity but seemed to be independent of microtubules.

40|$|The {{budding yeast}} {{contains}} two type I myosins, Myo 3 p and Myo 5 p, with redundant functions.

Expression <b>of</b> myc-tagged <b>Myo</b> 5 p in myo 3 Δ myo 5 Δ cells fully restores wild-type characteristics. Myo 5 p is localized as punctate, cortical structures enriched at sites of polarized cell growth. We find that latrunculin-A–induced depolymerization of F-actin results in loss <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 5 p patches. Moreover, incubation of yeast cells at 37 °C results in transient depolarization <b>of</b> both <b>Myo</b> 5 p patches and the actin cytoskeleton. Mutant Myo 5 proteins with deletions in nonmotor domains were expressed in myo 3 Δ myo 5 Δ cells {{and the resulting}} strains were analyzed for Myo 5 p function. Deletion of the tail homology 2 (TH 2) domain, previously implicated in ATP-insensitive actin binding, has no detectable effect on Myo 5 p function. In contrast, myo 3 Δ myo 5 Δ cells expressing mutant Myo 5 proteins with deletions of the src homology domain 3 (SH 3) or both TH 2 and SH 3 domains display defects including Myo 5 p patch depolarization, actin disorganization, and phenotypes associated with actin dysfunction. These findings support a role for the SH 3 domain in Myo 5 p localization and function in budding yeast. The proline-rich protein verprolin (Vrp 1 p) binds to the SH 3 domain <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 3 p or Myo 5 p in two-hybrid tests, coimmunoprecipitates with Myo 5 p, and colocalizes with Myo 5 p.

Its molecular functions and its mechanism of regulation are not known. In mammalian cells, myosin-I is excluded from specific microfilament populations, indicating that its localization is tightly regulated. Identifying the mechanism of this localization, and the specific actin populations with which myosin-I interacts, is crucial to understanding the molecular functions of this motor. eGFP chimeras <b>of</b> <b>myo</b> 1 b [7] were imaged in live and fixed NRK cells. Ratio-imaging microscopy shows that myo 1 b-eGFP concentrates within dynamic areas of the actin cytoskeleton, most notably in membrane ruffles.

Truncation mutants consisting of the motor or tail domains show a partially overlapping cytoplasmic localization with full-length myo 1 b, but do not concentrate in membrane ruffles.

Double-headed myosins that move processively along actin filaments achieve this by successive binding {{of the two}} heads in a hand-over-hand mechanism. This mechanism, obviously, cannot operate in single-headed myosins. However, it has been proposed that a long class IX specific insertion in the myosin head domain at loop 2 acts as an F-actin tether, allowing for single-headed processive movement. Here, we tested this proposal directly by analysing the movement of deletion constructs of the class IX myosin from Caenorhabditis elegans (<b>Myo</b> IX). Deletion <b>of</b> the large basic loop 2 insertion led {{to a loss of}} processive behaviour, while deletion of the N-terminal head extension, a second unique domain of class IX myosins, did not influence the motility <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> IX. The processive behaviour <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> IX is also abolished with increasing salt concentrations. These observations directly demonstrate that the insertion located in loop 2 acts as an electrostatic actin tether during movement <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> IX along the actin track...|$|R
40|$|Tumor {{suppressor}} genes {{play a role}} as {{a growth}} regulator and a gatekeeper of a cell. Their inactivation is often detected in malignant tumors. Identification of novel tumor suppressor gene candidates may help to further understand tumorigenesis and aid in {{the discovery of a}} new treatment leading toward cure of cancer. This PhD research project aimed to understand functional significance of a novel tumor suppressor gene candidate, myosin IC (MYO 1 C) and to identify potential interaction(s) <b>of</b> the <b>MYO</b> 1 C protein with key components of the signaling pathways involving in cancer development. In an experimental rat model for endometrial carcinoma (EC), detailed molecular genetic analysis of a candidate tumor suppressor region located distal to the tumor protein 53 (Tp 53) suggested the myosin IC gene (Myo 1 c) as the best potential target for deletion of the genetic material. The question arising was whether and how MYO 1 C could function as a tumor suppressor gene. By using qPCR, Western blot or immunohistochemistry analyses, we examined MYO 1 C protein level in panels of well-stratified human colorectal cancer (CRC) and EC respectively. We found that MYO 1 C was significantly down-regulated in these cancer materials and that for the EC panel, the observed down-regulation <b>of</b> <b>MYO</b> 1 C correlated with tumor stage, where tumors at more advanced stages had less expression <b>of</b> <b>MYO</b> 1 C. In cell transfection experiments, we found that over-expression <b>of</b> <b>MYO</b> 1 C significantly decreased cell proliferation, and silencing MYO 1 C with siRNA increased cell viability. Additionally, knockdown <b>of</b> <b>MYO</b> 1 C impaired the ability of cells to migrate, spread and adhere to the surface. Recent published studies suggested a potential interplay between MYO 1 C and the phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /AKT pathway. To examine this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression and/or activation of components of the PI 3 K/AKT and RAS/ERK signaling pathways in vivo in CRC samples, and in vitro in cells transfected with the MYO 1 C gene expression construct or MYO 1 C-targeted siRNA. To identify other potential pathways/ mechanisms through which MYO 1 C may exert its tumor suppressor activity, we additionally performed new sets <b>of</b> <b>MYO</b> 1 C-siRNA knockdown experiments. At different time points post transfection, we performed microarray global gene expression experiments followed by bioinformatics analysis of the data. Altogether, the results suggested an early PI 3 K/AKT response to altered MYO 1 C expression. We additionally identified several cancer-related genes/pathways with late response to MYO 1 C knockdown. All things considered, the identification <b>of</b> <b>MYO</b> 1 C-expression impact on cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion in combination with its interplay between several cancer-related genes and signaling pathways provide further evidence for the initial hypothesis of a tumor suppressor activity <b>of</b> <b>MYO</b> 1 C.  Cellular, Molecular and Functional Characterization of the Tumor Suppressor Candidate MYO 1...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{years after}} the 1991 Persian Gulf War (GW I), a {{comprehensive}} evaluation of a national cohort of deployed veterans (DV) demonstrated a higher prevalence of several medical conditions, in comparison to a similarly identified cohort of nondeployed veterans (NDV). The present study determined the prevalence of medical conditions among nonveteran <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> these GW I DV and NDV. A cohort <b>of</b> 490 <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> GW I DV and 537 <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> GW I NDV underwent comprehensive face-to-face examinations.

40|$|Class V myosins move diverse {{intracellular}} cargoes, which attach via {{interaction of}} cargo-specific proteins to the myosin V globular tail. The globular {{tail of the}} yeast myosin V, Myo 2 p, contains two structural and functional subdomains. Subdomain I binds to the vacuole-specific protein, Vac 17 p, while subdomain II likely binds to an as yet unidentified secretory vesicle-specific protein. All functions <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 2 p require the tight association of subdomains I and II, which suggests that binding of a cargo to one subdomain may inhibit cargo-binding to a second subdomain. Thus, two types of mutations are predicted to specifically affect a subset <b>of</b> <b>Myo</b> 2 p cargoes: first are mutations within a cargo-specific binding region; second are mutations that mimic the inhibited conformation {{of one of the}} subdomains. Here we analyze a point mutation in subdomain I, myo 2 - 2 (G 1248 D), which is likely to be this latter type <b>of</b> mutation. <b>myo</b> 2 - 2 has no effect on secretory vesicle movement. The secretory vesicle binding site is in subdomain II. However, myo 2 - 2 is impaired in several Myo 2 p-related functions. While subdomains I and II <b>of</b> <b>myo</b> 2 - 2 p tightly associate, there are measurable differences in the conformation of its globular tail. Based solely on the ability to restore vacuole inheritance, a set of intragenic suppressors <b>of</b> <b>myo</b> 2 - 2 were identified. All suppressor mutations reside in subdomain I. Moreover, subdomain I and II interactions occurred in all suppressors, demonstrating the importance of subdomain I and II association for Myo 2 p function. Furthermore, 3 of the 10 suppressors globally restored all tested defects in myo 2 - 2. This large proportion of global suppressors strongly suggests that myo 2 - 2 (G 1248) causes a conformational change in subdomain I that simultaneously affects multiple cargoes...|$|R
