40|$|MBA Professional ReportThe {{motivation}} for using Flight Training Synthetic Environment Technology (FTSET) in military aviation {{is to create}} a cost-efficient and a risk-managed training environment. However, deciding on the appropriate mix of synthetic versus actual flight training remains a great unresolved issue. Further, FTSET usage and its adoption level may vary across the aviation community and flight training curricula. TUAA has employed FTSET in helicopter flight training since 1990. Since then, it has exhibited three different FTSET Support Usage patterns, which include an initial phase of lower support rates until 1997, a substantial increase phase from 1997 - 2001, and a leveling-off phase, where growth stagnated, from 2001 - 2006. We hypothesize that these <b>sequential</b> <b>phasing</b> can be explained in terms of the organizational culture in which the FTSET is employed, organizational changes that favor FTSET usage and increasing FTSET expertise in the usage, and the current FTSET's limited technical capability and its sole support for one type of helicopter. To test our hypotheses we develop a systems dynamics model of the FTSET adoption process (AP) that has three interrelated sectors: Technology Improvement and Acquisition, Technology Adoption, and Technology Discarding. The Diffusion Model is also used as a framework to help explain the TUAA's FTSET AP from 1990 to 2006. The purpose is to understand this AP and to generate a policy for the current and future FTSET AP. Turkish Army author...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Asymmetric {{multicore}} processors (AMP) {{are built}} of cores that expose the same ISA but differ in performance, complexity, and power consumption. A typical AMP might {{consist of a}} plenty of slow, small and simple cores {{and a handful of}} fast, large and complex cores. AMPs have been proposed as a more energy efficient alternative to symmetric multicore processors. They are particularly interesting in their potential to mitigate Amdahl’s law for parallel program with <b>sequential</b> <b>phases.</b> While a parallel phase of the code runs on plentiful slow cores enjoying low energy per instruction, the <b>sequential</b> <b>phase</b> can run on the fast core, enjoying high single-thread performance of that core. As a result, performance per unit of energy is maximized. In this paper we evaluate the effects of accelerating <b>sequential</b> <b>phases</b> of parallel applications on an AMP. Using a synthetic workload generator and an efficient asymmetry-aware user-level scheduler, we explore how the workload’s properties determine the speedup that the workload will experience on an AMP system. Such an evaluation has been performed before only analytically; experimental studies have been limited to a small number of workloads. Our study is the first to experimentally explore benefits on AMP systems {{for a wide range of}} workloads. I...|$|R

We conducted two <b>sequential</b> <b>phase</b> I trials to evaluate the feasibility and the recommended dose of erlotinib when combined with fluoropyrimidine-oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. A total of 21 metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRCCRCCRC) patients were treated in two <b>sequential</b> <b>phase</b> I trials. In the first trial, 12 patients were treated with escalating doses of erlotinib plus FOLFOX. In the second, 9 patients were treated with escalating doses of erlotinib combined with oxaliplatin, capecitabine and bevacizumab. No MTDMTDMTD was reached in either of the trials. The only dose-limiting toxicities observed were neutropenia and diarrhea. No unexpected toxicities were noted. Hematological toxicity was the most frequently noted adverse event with infusional 5 FU therapy, while gastrointestinal toxicity {{was the most common}} adverse event. In the second trial most patients withdrew from treatment due to toxicity, and less than half completed the therapeutic program as per protocol, mostly due to toxicity.

40|$|A {{control method}} for Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) non-Gaussian random {{vibration}} test with cross spectra consideration is {{proposed in the}} paper. The aim of the proposed control method is to replicate the specified references composed of auto spectral densities, cross spectral densities and kurtoses on the test article in the laboratory. It is found that the cross spectral densities will bring intractable coupling problems and induce difficulty for {{the control of the}} multi-output kurtoses. Hence, a <b>sequential</b> <b>phase</b> modification method is put forward to solve the coupling problems in multi-input multi-output non-Gaussian random vibration test. To achieve the specified responses, an improved zero memory nonlinear transformation is utilized first to modify the Fourier phases of the signals with <b>sequential</b> <b>phase</b> modification method to obtain one frame reference response signals which satisfy the reference spectra and reference kurtoses. Then, an inverse system method is used in frequency domain to obtain the continuous stationary drive signals. At the same time, the matrix power control algorithm is utilized to control the spectra and kurtoses of the response signals further. At the end of the paper, a simulation example with a cantilever beam and a vibration shaker test are implemented and the results support the proposed method very well.
