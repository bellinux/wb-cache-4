In addition, Bissonnette {{states that the}} report of bin Laden's daughter Safia having <b>splintered</b> wood striking her foot is false, as he explains that it was rather his wife Amal who was injured by such fragments.|$|E
5|$|Archie Clement led {{the guerrillas}} after Anderson's death, {{but the group}} <b>splintered</b> by mid-November. Most Confederate guerrillas lost heart around that time, owing to a cold winter {{and the failure of}} General Price's 1864 Missouri campaign, which ensured that the state would remain under Union control. As the Confederacy collapsed, most of Anderson's men joined Quantrill's forces or {{traveled}} to Texas. Jim Anderson moved to Sherman, Texas, with his two sisters.|$|E
5|$|Religious peace {{came with}} the {{emergence}} of the Macedonian dynasty in 867, as well as a strong and unified Byzantine leadership; while the Abassid empire had <b>splintered</b> into many factions after 861. Basil I revived the Byzantine Empire into a regional power, during a period of territorial expansion, making the Empire the strongest power in Europe, with an ecclesiastical policy marked by good relations with Rome. Basil allied with the Holy Roman Emperor Louis II against the Arabs, and his fleet cleared the Adriatic Sea of their raids.|$|E

5|$|The {{reality of}} defeat for Austria caused a reevaluation of {{internal}} divisions, local autonomy, and liberalism. The new North German Confederation {{had its own}} constitution, flag, and governmental and administrative structures. Through military victory, Prussia under Bismarck's influence had overcome Austria's active resistance {{to the idea of}} a unified Germany. Austria's influence over the German states may have been broken, but the war also <b>splintered</b> the spirit of pan-German unity: most of the German states resented Prussian power politics.|$|E
5|$|Costa Gomes {{argued that}} African {{soldiers}} were cheaper and were {{better able to}} create a relationship with the local populace, a tactic similar to the 'hearts and minds' strategy being used by United States forces in Vietnam at the time. These Flechas units saw action in the territory at the very end stages of the conflict, following the dismissal of Kaúlza de Arriaga {{on the eve of the}} Portuguese coup in 1974 – the Carnation Revolution. The units were to continue to cause problems for the FRELIMO even after the Revolution and Portuguese withdrawal, when the country <b>splintered</b> into civil war.|$|E
5|$|Egypt's wealth, however, made it {{a tempting}} target for invasion, {{particularly}} by the Libyan Berbers to the west, and the Sea Peoples, a conjectured confederation of seafarers from the Aegean Sea. Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern Canaan, much of it falling to the Assyrians. The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and civil unrest. After regaining their power, the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their expanded power <b>splintered</b> the country during the Third Intermediate Period.|$|E

5|$|Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union <b>splintered</b> {{into several}} {{different}} factions. Some {{of the more}} radical elements, including Al-Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1970s, Yugoslavia's Communist regime became {{severely}} <b>splintered</b> into a liberal-decentralist nationalist faction led by Croatia and Slovenia {{that supported}} a decentralized federation to give greater autonomy to Croatia and Slovenia, versus a conservative-centralist nationalist faction led by Serbia that supported a centralized federation to secure Serbia's and Serbs' interests across Yugoslavia – {{as they were}} the largest ethnic group in {{the country as a}} whole. From 1967 to 1972 in Croatia and 1968 and 1981 protests in Kosovo, nationalist doctrines and actions caused ethnic tensions that destabilized Yugoslavia. The suppression by the state of nationalists is believed to have had the effect of identifying nationalism as the primary alternative to communism itself and made it a strong underground movement.|$|E
5|$|The Terrans are {{a fictional}} future version of {{humanity}} in the StarCraft series.

The Terrans have been dedicated a full campaign in each real-time strategy video game installment to date, and are defined in-game by their specialization of units and tactics of defense and mobility. In the series' storyline, the Terrans are usually displayed as being caught in-between the conflict between the Protoss and Zerg while also dealing with frequent civil wars.|$|E

Recognizing great sensitivity in April, he begins training her as a kunoichi, and comes to regard her with a fatherly fondness. <b>Splinter</b> ventures from his lair on only two occasions.

5|$|The {{original}} church {{within this}} movement, founded in April 1830 in New York by Joseph Smith, was the Church of Christ, which was later named the Church of the Latter Day Saints. It was renamed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1838 (stylized as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the United Kingdom), which remained its official name until Smith's death in 1844.

A few days later, Hardkoop sat next to a stream, his feet so swollen that they split open, and he was not seen again.

Danilo Di Luca launched an attack on the fourth climb of the day, and for a time he and Menchov were clear of the other GC contenders, but they were also caught — the top seven in the GC were unchanged after this stage.|$|E

5|$|After World War I the Liberal Party {{began to}} disintegrate. As the Liberals <b>splintered</b> Labour emerged {{to become the}} party of {{progressive}} politics in Scotland, gaining a solid following among working classes of the urban lowlands, {{and as a result}} the Unionists were able to gain most of the votes of the middle classes, who now feared Bolshevik revolution, setting the social and geographical electoral pattern in Scotland that would last until the late 20th century. With all the main parties committed to the Union new nationalist and independent political groupings began to emerge, including the National Party of Scotland in 1928 and Scottish Party in 1930. They joined together to form the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1934 with the goal of creating an independent Scotland, but it enjoyed little electoral success in the Westminster system.|$|E

Adding to the confusion, Chinese reconnaissance teams resorted to sweet musics and dancing to lure the Americans into exposing their positions, and the resulting Chinese counter fire caused the loss of the G Company on the 38th Infantry Regiment's center. The Chinese had also penetrated the 38th Infantry Regiment's left flank, blocking the regiment's retreat route in the process. By the morning of November 26, Chinese troops were spotted all around the 38th Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The city's fortifications were strong, {{with a wide}} moat and a {{thick wall}} {{protected}} by 44 towers, according to the contemporary geographer Ibn Khordadbeh. The caliph assigned each of his generals to a stretch of the walls. Both besiegers and besieged had many siege engines, and for three days both sides exchanged missile fire while Arab sappers tried to undermine the walls. According to Arab accounts, an Arab prisoner who had converted to Christianity defected back to the caliph, and informed him about {{a place in the}} wall which had been badly damaged by heavy rainfall and only hastily and superficially repaired due to the city commander's negligence. As a result, the Arabs concentrated their efforts on this section. The defenders tried to protect the wall by hanging wooden beams to absorb the shock of the siege engines, but they <b>splintered,</b> and after two days a breach was made. Immediately Aetios realized that the defence was compromised, and decided to try and break through the besieging army during the night and link up with Theophilos. He sent two messengers to the emperor, but both were captured by the Arabs and brought before the caliph. Both agreed to convert to Islam, and Mu'tasim, after giving them a rich reward, paraded them around the city walls in full view of Aetios and his troops. To prevent any sortie, the Arabs stepped up their vigilance, maintaining constant cavalry patrols even during the night.|$|E
5|$|Tradition and old records {{assert that}} {{southern}} Somalia, including the Mogadishu area, was historically inhabited by hunter-gatherers. These were later joined by Cushitic-speaking agro-pastoralists, {{who would go}} on to establish local aristocracies. During its medieval Golden Age, Mogadishu was ruled by the Muzaffar dynasty, a vassal of the Ajuran Sultanate. It subsequently fell under the control of an assortment of local Sultanates and polities, most notably the Sultanate of the Geledi. The city later became the capital of Italian Somaliland (1889–1936) in the colonial period. After the Somali Republic became independent in 1960, Mogadishu became known and promoted as the White Pearl of the Indian Ocean. After the ousting of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 and the ensuing Somali Civil War, various militias fought for control of the city, later to be replaced by the Islamic Courts Union in the mid-2000s. The ICU thereafter <b>splintered</b> into more radical groups, notably al-Shabaab, which fought the Transitional Federal Government (2004–2012) and its African Union Mission to Somalia allies. With a change in administration in late 2010, government troops and their military partners had succeeded in forcing out Al-Shabaab by August 2011. Mogadishu has subsequently experienced a period of intense reconstruction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Splinter</b> bids are {{a variety}} of cue bids. <b>Splinters</b> are used early in the bidding to {{communicate}} a strong hand, with a fit for partner's last bid suit and a side-suit singleton or void.
