5|$|While European-born {{players were}} a part of the NHL since its founding, it was still rare to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league until 1980. The WHA turned to the {{previously}} overlooked European market in search for talent, signing players from Finland and Sweden. Anders Hedberg, Lars-Erik Sjoberg and Ulf Nilsson signed with the Jets in 1974 and thrived in North America, both in the WHA and later the NHL. The Jets won three of the six remaining WHA championships after signing European players, and their success sparked similar signings league-wide.|$|E
5|$|While European-born {{players were}} a part of the NHL since its founding, it was still rare to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NHL until 1980, {{although}} the WHA employed a number of them. Borje Salming was the first European star in the NHL and Finns Jari Kurri and Esa Tikkanen helped lead the Oilers dynasty of the 1980s. The WHA opened the door, and players slowly joined the NHL, but those behind the Iron Curtain were restricted from following suit. In 1980, Peter Stastny, his wife, and his brother Anton secretly fled Czechoslovakia with the aid of Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut. The Stastnys' defection made international headlines, and contributed to the first wave of Europeans' entrance into the NHL. Hoping that they would one day be permitted to play in the NHL, teams drafted Soviet players in the 1980s, 27 in all by the 1988 draft; however, defection was the only way such players could play in the NHL. Shortly {{before the end of the}} 1988–89 regular season, Flames general manager Cliff Fletcher announced that he had reached an agreement with Soviet authorities that allowed Sergei Pryakhin to play in North America. It was the first time a member of the Soviet national team was permitted to leave the Soviet Union. Shortly after, Soviet players began to flood into the NHL. Teams anticipated that there would be an influx of Soviet players in the 1990s, as 18 Soviets were selected in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft.|$|E

25|$|Lady Curzon {{learned about}} the great one-horned {{rhinoceroses}} of Kaziranga from her tea-plantation friends and wanted to <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> winter of 1904 she visited the Kaziranga area, and saw some of their hoof marks, but was disappointed by not having seen a single rhinoceros. It was reported that the noted Assamese animal tracker, Balaram Hazarika, showed Lady Curzon around Kaziranga and impressed upon her {{the urgent need for}} its conservation. Concerned about the dwindling numbers of rhinoceros, she asked her husband to take the necessary action to save the rhinoceros, which he did. The Kaziranga Proposed Reserve Forest thus was created. Later it was developed into the Kaziranga National Park.|$|E

25|$|Roman {{influences}} may {{be found}} around us today, in banks, government buildings, great houses, and even small houses, perhaps {{in the form of}} a porch with Doric columns and a pediment or in a fireplace or a mosaic shower floor derived from a Roman original, often from Pompeii or Herculaneum. The mighty pillars, domes and arches of Rome echo in the New World too, where in Washington DC we <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Capitol Building, the White House, the Lincoln Memorial and other government buildings. All across the US the seats of regional government were normally built in the grand traditions of Rome, with vast flights of stone steps sweeping up to towering pillared porticoes, with huge domes gilded or decorated inside with the same or similar themes that were popular in Rome.|$|E
25|$|Realizing {{what the}} Dragon means, Henry leads {{everyone}} {{back to the}} fountain, where he proceeds to wish for his family to be brought back, encouraging Emma, Regina, Gold, and Violet to do the same. Suddenly, the crystal starts to pulsate. Henry then climbs a statue and convinces the citizens of New York City to help them return magic to the world. The portal opens in the Bethesda fountain, and Gold walks through it. Hook, Snow, David, Jekyll and Zelena appear {{in front of the}} others. Regina, Henry, Emma, and Violet <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bethesda fountain as they reunited. Unfortunately, Henry is left saddened that the crowd believed that the rescue was simply an illusion; Emma consoles him, explaining that it's {{the only way they can}} understand it. She was much like them until his near-death experience forced her to believe in magic.|$|E
25|$|The city’s {{most famous}} tourist {{attraction}} is the Mummies of Guanajuato, {{which are in}} their own museum {{on the side of}} the municipal cemetery in the Tepetapa neighborhood. The Mummy Museum contains a collection of specimens that mummified naturally in the adjoining cemetery. Authorities began exhuming bodies in 1870, when a new law required residents to pay a tax for perpetual burial. If survivors didn't pay the tax, they exhumed the body. If the body was mummified, they stored it in a building above ground and people began paying to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1800s. The burial tax was abolished in 1958. At first, the mummies were displayed in a poorly lit tunnel that visitors entered with a torch or candle. Visitors were allowed to touch the mummies with some even breaking off pieces for souvenirs or to verify the body was real. The modern museum opened in 1970 with proper lighting and ventilation, and the mummies protected behind glass.|$|E

Hole resumed touring with Imperial Teen. Love would later make claims that an additional reason the band left the tour was due to Manson and Korn's (whom they also toured with in Australia) sexualized treatment of teenage female audience members. Love told interviewers at 99X.FM in Atlanta: [...] "What I really don't like—there are certain girls that like us, or like me, who are really messed up... and they {{do not need to be}}—they're very young—and they do not need to be taken and raped, or filmed having enema contests... going out into the audience and picking up fourteen and fifteen-year-old girls who obviously cut themselves, and then having to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning... it's just uncool." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bermuda {{pulled off}} a narrow victory over Canada in Toronto to leave them favourites to win the Americas group. Canada won the toss and put Bermuda into bat, a {{decision}} that was soon vindicated as their guests were skittled for 125 in 59.5 overs, with only Clay Smith (52) and Janeiro Tucker (25) putting up any sort of resistance. The damage was done by Canada's 21-year-old left-arm medium pace bowler, Umar Bhatti, who got 8 for 40. By {{the end of the}} first day, Canada had already overhauled this total, and were on 149 for 6. The innings closed on the second day at 207, of which 76 were made by Ashish Bagai. Bermuda did better in their second innings, mostly due to Tucker's 123 that helped swing the game. By the time they had finished their innings they had 311 on the board and a defendable lead of 229. Early wickets saw the hosts collapse to 17 for 4 before a recovery took them to 164 for 6. A final push by Bermuda saw them all out for 181, and put the Bermudians in control of the group: a win in their next game would <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semi-finals.|$|E

When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved."
