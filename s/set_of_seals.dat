40|$|Abstract-The use of Lithium Ion (LiIon) cells {{requires}} a battery management system {{to ensure that}} the LiIon cells can be operated safely and the battery pack will operate optimally. Lithium-ion batteries use an electrolyte that is flammable if exposed to high temperatures. Slight differences between the series-connected cells in a LiIon battery pack can produce imbalances in the cell voltages, and this greatly reduces the charge capacity. These batteries cannot be trickle charged like a lead acid battery because this would slightly overcharge some cells and would cause these cells to ignite. There are different methods used {{to ensure that the}} cells of a battery pack are not overcharged.

Equivalences allow for repeated interethnic marriages while preserving the structural specificities of each social system involved. As people move from one community to another, they adopt new cultural features and a new surname, but on a broader scale, prescribed alliances and relations of exogamy are preserved. The possibility of ethnic conversions opens up several fundamental questions on the ethnic and cultural genesis of the region.

40|$|International audienceMineral {{precipitation}} in the pores {{of a rock}} may exert a force, {{which is}} called crystallization pressure. This process has been studied experimentally and results bring a new look on the way fractures may develop and seal in natural systems. Cylindrical core samples of porous limestone and sandstone were left for several weeks in contact with an aqueous solution saturated with sodium chloride, at 30 or 45 °C, under axial normal stress in the range 0. 02 - 0. 26 MPa. The fluid was allowed to rise in the core samples by capillary forces, up to a controlled height where evaporation and precipitation occurred. The uniaxial deformation of the samples was measured using high-resolution displacement sensors. The samples were characterized using computed X-ray tomography, allowing therefore imaging in 3 D the intensity and localization of the damage. Two kinds of damage could be observed. Firstly, small rock fragments were peeled from the sample surface. Secondly, and more interestingly, fracture networks developed, by nucleation of microcracks at the interface where evaporation occurred, and propagation to the free surface. Two families of fractures could be identified. A first <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>sealed</b> fracture parallel to the evaporation front is directly induced by crystallization pressure. A second fracture network, perpendicular to the evaporation front, accommodates the first <b>set</b> <b>of</b> fractures.

40|$|This {{technology}} {{provides a}} simple yet clever idea for preventing oil and saltwater polluting spills by sucker rod pumping oil wells, {{as well as}} prolonging {{the life of the}} stuffing box seals and pressure lubricating the polished rod. This objective is accomplished by introducing a non-polluting, food grade, high viscosity lubricant into the void space between two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> in a typical stuffing box. This safe-fluid acts as a sacrificial fluid that will be the fluid that is exposed to the atmosphere when the primary seal in the stuffing box leaks for any reason. In addition, the pressure on this sacrificial safe-fluid is maintained at the same pressure as the pressure on the produced fluid in the flow line at the pumping tee, thereby equalizing the pressure across the secondary seal in the stuffing box that separates the safe-fluid from the produced fluid. The unique feature, of equalizing the pressure across the secondary seal, is accomplished by using a pressure transmitter which is monitoring the pressure in the flow line (which is the fluid under the secondary seal) and transmitting that pressure to the safe-fluid (which is the fluid above the secondary seal) thereby equalizing the pressure across this secondary seal. The primary seal will be sealing the safe-fluid and will be operating under optimum conditions, extending the life <b>of</b> this primary <b>seal.</b> The principle <b>of</b> the invention was proven by equipping eight oil wells with Field Retro-Fit Packages of Independent component parts to hydro-balance the existing stuffing boxes...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 35 Improvement in the {{efficiency}} of enhanced oil recovery techniques at the Kuparak, Alaska, oil field required replacement of reciprocating pump with a larger capacity centrifugal pump. During the specification of a high speed two-stage centrifugal pump, the mechanical seals and seal support system were identified as key factors for a successful installation. While not all encompassing, the mechanical seal pressure velocity (PV) parameter, does allow the user to gauge the duty level <b>of</b> a mechanical <b>seal.</b> Since low leakage mechanical seals typically operate with a very small fluid film between the stationary and rotating faces, significant friction and heat may be generated when the pressures and rubbing velocities become high. Thus, the higher the PV parameter, the more crucial the physical seal design and material selection become to minimize heat and maintain an acceptable life. Although the pump and seal manufacturer had successful seal experience up to PV = 2. 1 million (psi-ft/min), the chosen pump configuration resulted in a PV = 2. 7 million, or 30 percent above the previous experience. Venturing beyond the current state-of-the-art seal, PV parameter necessitates an extensive qualification program to ensure that pump reliability and process safety management practices were met. To accomplish these objectives, a stringent <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>seal</b> qualification requirements were prepared by the contractor and end user to satisfactorily demonstrate: No catastrophic failures during normal and transient operation, A predicted seal life in excess of one year, and a maximum leakage rate of 150 ml/hr.

50|$|As {{described}} by Brown, an HDR {{geothermal energy system}} is developed, first, by using conventional drilling to access a region of deep, hot basement rock. Once it has been determined that the selected region contains no open faults or joints (by far the most common situation), an isolated section of this first borehole is pressurized at a level high enough to open several <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> previously <b>sealed</b> joints in the rock mass. By continuous pumping (hydraulic stimulation), a very large region of stimulated rock is created (the HDR reservoir) that consists of an interconnected array of joint flow paths within the rock mass. The opening of these flow paths causes movement along the pressure-activated joints, generating seismic signals (microearthquakes). Analysis of these signals yields information about the location and dimensions of the reservoir being developed.|$|R
