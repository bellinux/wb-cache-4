50|$|A {{sanctuary}} {{has some}} columns preserved, {{and in a}} small atrium parts of mosaics are found. Curbstones, doorsteps, thresholds, and floors of <b>simple</b> <b>mosaic</b> layers are found all over the ruins. Still archaeologists work on the Kerkouane site, but {{it is believed that}} the best parts have already been discovered.|$|E
5000|$|The portico (or porch) of the Basilica is {{supported}} by four re-used classical columns (each of a different marble) supporting five arches. The main door is framed with a <b>simple</b> <b>mosaic</b> of red and green porphyry. [...] The well-head, {{from the time of}} Pope Adrian I, has a double row circular design around its barrel and a Latin inscription completely around its crown: ...|$|E
50|$|At {{least one}} mosaic appears in all villas, usually {{on the floor}} in public areas (and {{especially}} in dining rooms by the empire’s end). Set in hard Roman cement and buried under collapsed debris, thousands have been found throughout northern Europe. <b>Simple</b> <b>mosaics</b> consisted of a geometric pattern, but an enormous range of cultural and artistic aspects of Roman life were also portrayed (including interpretations of classical literature and Roman mythology).|$|R
5|$|While some mosaics {{have been}} {{unearthed}} from religious sanctuaries and public buildings, {{most of them}} were found in residential buildings and private homes. The majority of these houses possess an irregular-shaped floor plan, while the second largest group were built with a peristyle central courtyard. <b>Simple</b> <b>mosaics</b> were usually relegated to normal walkways, whereas rooms designated for receiving guests featured more richly-decorated mosaics. However, only twenty-five houses of Delos feature opus tessellatum mosaics and only eight houses possess the opus vermiculatum-style motifs and figured scenes. The vast majority of decorated floors feature only simple geometric patterns. It is also more common for opus vermiculatum and opus tessellatum mosaics to be found in upstairs rooms than on the ground floors of ancient Delian homes. With the exception of the House of Dionysos and House of the Dolphins, the courtyards of peristyle homes in Delos feature only floral and geometric motifs.|$|R
50|$|The angle {{represents}} a stylized peacock—the emblem of royalty—is surmounted by a finial; below the eaves-boards is a pendant {{turned in the}} lathe. This same peacock is everywhere found at the points of the gables, forming a hip-knob, with the pendant below. All these carvings, besides being gilt, were also decorated with <b>simple</b> glass <b>mosaic.</b> The details above given apply mostly {{to all the other}} apartments.|$|R
5000|$|Then, when {{loading the}} mosaic of image {{thumbnails}} (or other heterogeneous images), the program simply maps every original indexed color pixel to its most approximated {{in the master}} palette (after dumping this into the hardware color registers), and writes the result in the video buffer. Here is a sample of a <b>simple</b> <b>mosaic</b> of the four image thumbnails using a master palette of 240 RGB arranged colors plus 16 additional intermediate shades of gray; all images are put together without a significant loss of color accuracy: ...|$|E
40|$|Generic {{properties}} of elastic phonon transport at a disordered interface are studied. The {{results show that}} phonon transmittance is a strong function of frequency and the disorder correlation length. At frequencies lower than the van Hove singularity the transmittance at a given frequency increases as the correlation length decreases. At low frequencies, this is reflected by different power laws for phonon conductance across correlated and uncorrelated disordered interfaces which are in approximate agreement with the perturbation theory of an elastic continuum. These results can {{be understood in terms}} of <b>simple</b> <b>mosaic</b> and two-color models of the interface...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chromosome 6 pter-p 24 {{deletion}} syndrome (OMIM # 612582) is {{a recognized}} chromosomal disorder. Most {{of the individuals}} with this syndrome carry a terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 6 (6 p) with a breakpoint within the 6 p 25. 3 p 23 region. An approximately 2. 1 Mb terminal region {{has been reported to}} be responsible for some major features of the syndrome. The phenotypic contributions of other deleted regions are unknown. Interstitial deletions of the region are uncommon, and reciprocal interstitial duplication in this region is extremely rare. Case presentation: We present a family carrying an interstitial deletion and its reciprocal duplication within the 6 p 25. 1 p 24. 3 region. The deletion is 5. 6 Mb in size and was detected by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in a 26 -month-old female proband who presented speech delay and mild growth delay, bilateral conductive hearing loss and dysmorphic features. Array CGH studies of her family members detected an apparently mosaic deletion of the same region in the proband’s mildly affected mother, but a reciprocal interstitial duplication in her phenotypically normal brother. Further chromosomal and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed that instead of a <b>simple</b> <b>mosaic</b> deletion of 6 p 25. 1 p 24. 3, the mother actually carries three cell populations in her peripheral blood, including a deletion (~ 70 %), a duplication (~ 8 %) and a normal (~ 22 %) populations. Therefore, both the deletion and duplication seen in the siblings were apparently inherited from the mother...|$|E
5|$|The House of the Trident {{contains}} peristyle panels {{with the}} motif of a black dolphin situated around a red anchor and black tridents against a white background. The theme suggests that {{the owners of the}} house were somehow connected to maritime pursuits. These <b>simple,</b> two-dimensional <b>mosaics</b> stand in contrast to the multicolored, finely-detailed, three-dimensional Hellenistic mosaics of figures and motifs. They are perhaps comparable or even linked to the black-and-white pavement mosaics that appear in Roman Italy some decades later.|$|R
50|$|An {{exceptionally}} well preserved, carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in Bethany, the early Byzantine {{church of the}} Lazarium which was built between 333 and 390. Because of its purely geometrical pattern, the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics {{of the time in}} Palestine and neighboring areas, especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem. A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more <b>simple</b> geometric <b>mosaic</b> floor.|$|R
50|$|A <b>simple</b> {{extension}} of <b>mosaic</b> knitting {{is to use}} multiple colors, rather than just two, although the limitations on the pattern become even more severe. Another variant is to hold the yarns on opposite edges (or to knit circularly), which allows the knitter to knit only one row per color.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our work}} was to study the {{molecular}} mechanisms involved in symptoms appearance of plants inoculated either with a virus or with a virus-satellite complex. In the first case, we tried {{to set up a}} reliable method for an early identification of PVYNTN strains present in Italy and causing potato tuber necrosis. This, to prevent their spread in the field and to avoid severe yield losses, especially in seed potato production. We tried to localize the particular genomic region responsible for tuber necrosis. To this purpose, we carried out RT-PCR experiments using various primer combinations, covering PVY genomic regions larger than those previously used by other authors. As the previous researchers, though, {{we were not able to}} differentiate all NTN from others PVY strains. This probably because of the frequent virus variability, due to both genomic mutations and possible recombination events among different strains. In the second case, we studied the influence of Y-sat (CaRNA 5 satellite) on symptoms of CMV (Cucumber mosaic virus) in Nicotiana benthamiana plants: strong yellowing appearance instead of <b>simple</b> <b>mosaic.</b> Wang et al (2004), inoculating the same infectious complex on tobacco plants transformed with a viral suppressor of plant silencing (HC-PRO), did not experience the occurrence of yellowing anymore and, therefore, hypotesized that changes in symptoms were due to plant post transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mechanism. In our case, inoculation of N. benthamiana plants transformed with another PTGS viral suppressor (p 19), and other plants defective for RNA polymerase 6 (involved in systemic silencing), still resulted in yellowing appearance. This, to our opinion, suggests that in our system another possible mechanism is involved...|$|E
50|$|Another {{method of}} hiding a message was to print {{it on the}} {{surfaces}} of mooncakes (which came in packages of four), as a <b>simple</b> puzzle or <b>mosaic.</b> To read the message, {{each of the four}} mooncakes was cut into four parts. The resulting 16 pieces were pieced together to reveal the message. The pieces of mooncake were then eaten to destroy the message.|$|R
40|$|We {{have devised}} a <b>simple</b> genetic <b>mosaic</b> screen, which {{circumvents}} the difficulties posed by phenotypic analysis of early lethal mutants, to analyze essential zygotic genes in Caenorhabditis elegans. The screen attempts to distinguish genes involved in cell type and/or lineage specific {{processes such as}} determination, differentiation or morphogenesis from genes involved in general processes such as intermediary metabolism by using the pattern of gene function to classify genes: genes required in one or a subset of early blastomeres may have specific functions, whereas genes required in all early blastomeres may have general functions. We found that 12 of 17 genes examined function in specific early blastomeres, suggesting that many zygotic genes contribute to specific early processes. We discuss the advantages and limitations of this screen, which is applicable to {{other regions of the}} C. elegans genome...|$|R
40|$|Several non-flight {{qualification}} test radiators were inspected using flash thermography. Flash thermography data analysis used raw and second derivative images to detect anomalies (Echotherm and <b>Mosaic).</b> <b>Simple</b> contrast evolutions were plotted for the detected anomalies {{to help in}} anomaly characterization. Many out-of-family indications were noted. Some out-of-family indications were classified as cold spot indications and are due to additional adhesive or adhesive layer behind the facesheet. Some out-of-family indications were classified as hot spot indications and are due to void, unbond or lack of adhesive behind the facesheet. The IR inspection helped in assessing expected manufacturing quality of the radiators...|$|R
50|$|The {{interiors}} {{are decorated}} with <b>simple</b> yet beautiful <b>mosaics</b> creating more optical effects and the floor is covered by an extremely soft Persian carpet with geometrical patterns as well. The main prayer area can accommodate up to 2,500 worshipers. Above this are galleries that are reserved for female worshipers. The main prayer hall it topped by a large central dome over 20 metres in diameter, which is surrounded by 16 smaller domes. The complex also includes an educational area with classroom and a library, a conference centre with a large auditorium, and an area where exhibitions are held.|$|R
40|$|There are {{situations}} {{where it is}} not possible to capture large documents with the given imaging media such as scanners or copying machines in a single stretch because of their inherent limitations. This results in capture of a large document in terms of split components of a document image. Hence, the need is to mosaic the split components into the original and put together the document image. In this paper, we present a novel and <b>simple</b> approach to <b>mosaic</b> two split images of a large document based on pixel value matching. The method compares the values of pixels in the columns of split images to identify the common or overlapping region (OR) in them, which helps in mosaicing of split images of a large document...|$|R
40|$|Haschenburger, J. K., Cowie, M. (2009). Floodplain {{stages in}} the braided Ngaruroro River, New Zealand. Geomorphology, 103, (3), 466 - 475. This study investigates {{floodplain}} deposits in the braided Ngaruroro River, New Zealand, to characterize and quantify the spatial extent of deposits {{at different stages of}} development. Using a sequence of aerial photography, depositional surfaces were mapped and then assigned a floodplain development stage based on age, the discharge causing inundation, and field observations of sediment and vegetation characteristics. The ensemble of floodplain deposits makes up 40 % of the river valley, the remainder being the active river bed. Stabilizing bars and mature floodplains dominate the floodplain ensemble. While the existence of stabilizing bars points to a recent shift or fluctuation in controlling conditions, the extent and location of mature units suggest an earlier change in hydrologic and sediment supply conditions that limited braidtrain mobility. Mosaics of different aged deposits range from <b>simple</b> two-stage <b>mosaics</b> to more complex arrangements of three and four stages. In the rapid evolution from stabilized bars to mature floodplains, a large amount of fine-grained sediment is stored in the Ngaruroro River valley, highlighting the possibility of finding extensive fine-grained facies in the ancient sedimentary record of braided systems. Understanding floodplain ensembles and their controls will contribute to effective restoration of braided rivers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|His {{brick house}} was two-and-a-half stories tall {{on a stone}} foundation. The Queen Anne style house {{featured}} a tower, typical of Queen Anne houses of the time. A square porch in the front had elements of Romanesque Revival. The only major alteration occurred in the 1930s, when a second porch was added when the house functioned as a senior citizens. The house featured twenty rooms with hardwood floors. The main hall had a carved, winding staircase to the second floor. The dining room had a small, <b>simple</b> fireplace of <b>mosaic</b> tile. A dumbwaiter could carry food and drink to the upper floors. The third floor {{was used as a}} ballroom with a door to the tower, allowing a view of the property. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 21, 1978.|$|R
50|$|Only scant remains {{prove that}} mosaics were still {{used in the}} Early Middle Ages. The Abbey of Saint-Martial in Limoges, {{originally}} an important place of pilgrimage, was totally demolished during the French Revolution except its crypt which was rediscovered in the 1960s. A mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century. It somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble, probably taken from antique pavements. This could also {{be the case with}} the early 9th century mosaic found under the Basilica of Saint-Quentin in Picardy, where antique motifs are copied but using only <b>simple</b> colors. The <b>mosaics</b> in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean at Lyon have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique simple colors. More fragments were found on the site of Saint-Croix at Poitiers which might be from the 6th or 9th century.|$|R
50|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Jerusalem in the Monastery of the Cross {{a section of the}} elaborate 5th century mosaic floor survived, incorporating pictures of peacocks, plants and geometric patterns. Early Byzantine mosaics were preserved in the Church of John the Baptist in Ein Kerem, the Beit Jimal Monastery (in the 5th century the Church of the Tomb of St. Stephen, mosaics discovered in 1916), the Church of the Seat of Mary (Kathisma) (from the 5-8th centuries, floral and geometric designs, cornucopiae, discovered in 1992-7) and the lower church at Shepherds' Field (or Beit Sahour, the Greek Orthodox site, a floor including crosses, and therefore must predate 427). An exceptionally well preserved, carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in Bethany, the early Byzantine church of the Lazarium which was built between 333 and 390. Because of its purely geometrical pattern, the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas, especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem. A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more <b>simple</b> geometric <b>mosaic</b> floor. In 2003 during the construction works of the Israeli West Bank barrier in Abu Dis workers damaged the remains of a Byzantine monastery which was subsequently excavated. The monastery church had an elaborate mosaic floor decorated with images of animals including a deer and an octopus.|$|R
40|$|There are {{situations}} {{where it is}} not possible to capture a large document with a given imaging media such as Scanner and Xerox machine in a single stretch because of their inherent limitations. This result in capturing a large document in terms of split components of an image. Hence, the need is to mosaic the split components into a large document image. In this paper, we present a new and <b>simple</b> approach to <b>mosaic</b> the two split images of a large document based on matching sum of values of pixels of window in the split images. The method compares the sum of values of pixels of window in split images to identify Overlapping Region (OLR) in the split images. The OLR, a region in common, helps in mosaicing of two split images of large document. However, a small OLR is assumed to be available at the end of split images of a large document. In addition to this, the OLR in the split images depends on the size of the window. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is satisfactorily. (C) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
