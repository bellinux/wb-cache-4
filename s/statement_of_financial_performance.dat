It indicates how the revenues (money received from the sale of products and services before expenses are taken out, also known as the “top line”) are transformed into the net income (the result after all revenues and expenses have been accounted for, also known as “net profit” or the “bottom line”). The purpose of the {{income statement}} is to show managers and investors whether the company made or lost money during the period being reported.|$|E

30|$|When a {{government}} implements accrual accounting, instead of cash-based accounting, the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>performance</b> {{is the most}} scrutinised component of the financial statements. 8 By comparing the operating revenues (R) with the operating expenses (E), its balance (B[*]=[*]R[*]−[*]E) shows whether citizens pay taxes that are equal to the public services they receive. The surplus (B[*]>[*] 0) or the deficit (B[*]<[*] 0) sparks the political discussion and captures both media and public attention. This is especially the case where a legal rule caps the deficit or even bans that possibility. In most Swiss cantons, the legislation governing public finance contains such a provision although at varying extents and magnitudes.|$|E

However, there is concern about the complexity of public sector general purpose financial statements and consequently their effectiveness as an accountability mechanism. In Australia, the Queensland government has moved {{to address this issue}} in local government authorities by introducing a Community Financial Report as a means <b>of</b> simplifying the <b>financial</b> <b>statements.</b> A feature <b>of</b> this initiative was the lack of prescription given to local government authorities in the preparation of this report. This paper examines the form and content included in Community Financial Reports and also uses a disclosure index to determine the level of disclosure in the reports. The results of this research show that the form and content <b>of</b> the Community <b>Financial</b> Reports varied considerably. There was no definitive style, with each report being unique. The disclosure index revealed low levels of disclosure by local government authorities {{in the first year of}} the report as well as a lack of analysis <b>of</b> the <b>Statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Performance,</b> Position and Cash Flows. As well, there was a significant difference in the disclosures made by rural local government authorities compared with urban local government authorities. The results of this research will be of interest to local government authorities and local government regulators as they aim to provide useful, understandable information for stakeholders...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 64). This internship report is based on my internship program and <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> 2010, 2011 and 2012 of Dhaka Bank Limited. In my internship period, I worked in General Banking. It was {{a great opportunity to}} experience and gather knowledge different types of banking operations. My faculty supervisor helped me to choose the topic- “Financial Performance Analysis of Dhaka Bank Limited”. In the new competitive business era, private banking sector is getting more competitive in Bangladesh. In this sector the most used financial statements are the balance sheet and profit and loss account where the balance sheet shows the financial position and profit and loss account shows the net profit or net loss of a bank. Ratio Analysis deals with these statements. Ratio analysis is the most popular trend to evaluate a bank’s performance over years or with other companies in an industry. In my report I had to study <b>Financial</b> <b>Performance</b> Analysis <b>of</b> Dhaka Bank Limited’s financial statements {{for the last three years}} then had to analyze and give significant comments regarding the changes in the financial position. Analysis and interpretation <b>of</b> these <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> through ratio analysis has now become an important technique for performance appraisal because the investors, financial experts, management executives and the bankers are always rely on these ratios to make important decisions. The management team of any bank, investor and the government agencies always concern about liquidity ratios and adequacy ratios of a bank which interprets the efficiency of a bank. As a part of my B. B. A program, I have spent 12 weeks in <b>Financial</b> <b>Performance</b> Analysis <b>of</b> Dhaka Bank Limited, Dhanmondi Model Branch learning the activities of general banking. I have analyzed the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Performance</b> Analysis <b>of</b> Dhaka Bank Limited to find out its ratios by using its past and current records. After preparing this report I came to know that analysis <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> through ratios helps to overcome the past flaws and make the future decisions and strategies. Therefore, it is very necessary for every organization whether the company’s size is to make financial statement and to analyze it by ratios. Fida HossainB. Business Administratio...|$|R

30|$|The {{heterogeneity}} is also {{strong in}} terms of reported and true balances of the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>performance.</b> Nonetheless, the standard deviation appears to be smaller for reported balances in many cantons, suggesting that AD is effectively used to smooth reported balances. On average additional depreciation charges lower the surplus from +[*] 129 CHF per capita down to a reported amount of +[*] 61 CHF per capita.

30|$|Accrual {{accounting}} {{increases the}} degree of technicality compared to cash-based accounting. As noted by Zimmerman (1977) or Giroux (1989), {{those who do not}} have expertise of accounting face many difficulties in dissecting the information provided by financial reports. The finance minister may rely on this asymmetry of expertise between himself on one side, {{the other members of the}} government (i.e. the spending ministers), and the members of parliament on the other side. The finance minister is all the more likely to do so when he has a legal obligation to balance the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>performance</b> or if he politically commits to lowering the debt.|$|E
40|$|Since 1992, New Zealand {{has engaged}} in a sector-neutral {{approach}} to accounting standard setting – where a transaction is accounted for based on its underlying economic nature {{rather than on the}} type of entity undertaking it. Underpinned by the premise that GAAP can be generalised across the public/private divide, we examine whether systematic differences exist between accounting policies adopted by reporting entities with different ownership and/or operating objectives. We find evidence of sector preference in the choice of useful life for comparable depreciable assets, and differences in policies for the amortisation of goodwill. We also find evidence of sector convergence in the choice of methods for accounting for valuation of non-current assets, deferred taxation and inventory. It is observed that the two accounting policies indicating sector preference have a more direct impact on the <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Performance</b> than the other policies examined...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the perception of investors in a rural bank as regards the uses <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements.</b> Rural banks are the main source <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> service in rural sub-Saharan Africa and their services are mostly patronized by rural folks. Illiteracy rates in developing countries are very high as compared to developed countries {{and most of these}} people are living in rural areas. Sixty percent (60 %) of Ghana’s population are rural dwellers and illiteracy levels are high in these areas. Financial information from relevant literature is used purposely for the comprehension <b>of</b> various <b>financial</b> positions <b>of</b> a company. <b>Financial</b> information from studies is most understood by expects with knowledge of account and finance. Investors who don’t have knowledge of account or finance rely on expects advice when making financial decisions. The study is therefore examining what extent of knowledge the rural dwellers who are mostly illiterates, and hence {{might not be able to}} understand <b>financial</b> <b>statements,</b> have <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> the bank in which they are investing. The data was collected from a sample of one hundred and eighty respondents using questionnaires and face to face interviews conducted with management staff of the bank and used for analysis. Analyses were presented in a statistical format using mean score, vein diagrams and ratio calculation. Majority of investors in the bank were found to have tertiary level education making them literate, and they could understand and interpret financial statements. They preferred to have more access to financial statements and perceived service delivery a priority. Managers of the bank use profitability and liquidity ratios calculated from the various <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> the bank to determine their performance. The research was conducted on just one of the many rural banks in Ghana and as such could lead to results which might be not representative of what patens in rest of the many rural banks scattered across the country. The present study adds to the existing literature by examine the issue of user perception <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> in sub-Saharan Africa i. e. a developing economy and the issue of illiterates knowledge <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>performance.</b> This seeks to determine their understanding of the bank’s performance measures.

40|$|The word ‘asset’ was {{originally}} {{taken into the}} English language, from the Latin ‘ad satis’ and French ‘asez’, as a term used at law meaning sufficient estate or effects to discharge debts. It later came {{to be used in}} the sense of property available for the payment of debts. Assets were understood to be property (objects owned and rights of ownership) that could be exchanged for cash. The importance of factual knowledge of the money equivalents of property and debts, in managing mercantile affairs, was emphasised in accounting manuals during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The rights of investors and creditors to factual up-to-date information about the <b>financial</b> state <b>of</b> affairs of companies, given the advent of limited liability, underscored the early company legislation that required the preparation and auditing <b>of</b> <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> property and debts. During the latter part of the nineteenth century the emphasis in accounting moved away from assets as exchangeable property to assets as deferred costs. Expectations took the place of observables. The abstract (expectational) notion of assets as ‘future economic benefits’ was embraced by accountants in the absence of rigorous definitions of the elements and functions <b>of</b> dated <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> position and <b>performance.</b> Assets are quantified financially by a heterogeneous mass of potentially inconsistent rules that, by and large, have no regard for the empirical nature of measurement.

However, in examining debtor’s turnover (in days), inventory turnover and operating cycle the company is able to sell out its inventories and collect debts quickly which may increase the company’s ability to raise funds when it is needed. Furthermore, in the long term financial stability, Woolworths is using a high level of debt which contributes two thirds of the company’s total assets.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how senior accounting staff in Victorian local councils are recording and reporting infrastructure assets (IAs) with their relevant depreciation in General Purpose Financial Reports (GPFRs). Infrastructure assets are long-lived assets such as roads, drains and bridges. Historically, the purpose of public sector accounting in Western countries has been to demonstrate that funds have been raised and expended strictly within the authority of the annual budget. This short-term charge/discharge objective, involving the use of a cash-based system of accounting, has effectively prevented the provision of information for long-term decision making and the assessment of those decisions. The major disadvantage for management purposes is the loss of information relating to the longterm benefits of expenditures with one of the major issues being the failure to record IAs and their relevant depreciation. The introduction of Australian Accounting Standard No. 27 Financial Reporting by Local Governments (AAS 27), which applies to all Australian local authorities and the Statements of Accounting Concepts (SACs) require IAs to be reported in the Statement of Financial Position and depreciation to be charged in the <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Performance</b> in order to reflect the loss of service potential in the operating period concerned. It is anticipated that the study will report the implications for the accountability of the implementation of IA accounting and the utility and relevance of IA information and depreciation for decision-making by both internal and external users. Conclusions on the consequences of current practices and recommendations for change will be developed to assist local government authorities and accounting bodies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} whether IFRS adoption {{improves the}} usefulness of accounting information in African capital markets. Consistent with the IASB (2010) conceptual framework which focuses on shareholders, I define usefulness as the increase in value relevance of earnings and book value of equity, asymmetric earnings timeliness and conditional conservatism and the predictive ability of earnings and cash flow. I use a relatively large sample of 347 firms listed in five African capital markets namely; Johannesburg, Nairobi, Cairo and Alexandria, Botswana and Casablanca Stock Exchanges. The thesis derives its motivation from the contemporary debate on fair value versus historical cost accounting, illiquidity of African markets and the adoption of IFRS in Africa. Although IFRS is widely adopted in Africa there are relatively few studies examining its usefulness. In Africa, capital markets are relatively small and illiquid (Smith et al., 2002 and Kenny and Moss, 1998), there are no sound IFRS enforcement mechanisms (Daske et al., 2011, Anandarajan and Hasan, 2010, World Bank, 2010 a, and Prather-Kinsey, 2006), culture is secretive and conservative (Dahawy et al., 2002 and Gray, 1988) and many accounting systems are based on government or bank capital models of corporate governance (Chamisa, 2000). Since, IFRS characterized by fair value accounting principles requires liquid and active markets for its appropriate use (Ball, 2008) and focuses on market led principles of measurement and disclosures (Walker, 2010) {{it is unclear how}} useful it is to market participants in illiquid markets particularly African capital markets. The research objectives are fourfold; to examine whether IFRS increases (i) the information content of earnings and book value of equity as measured through the earnings response coefficient (ERC), the book value response coefficient (BRC) and adjusted R 2 (ii) the asymmetric earnings timeliness and conditional conservatism as a measure of stewardship role of management to capital providers, (iii) the predictive ability of earnings and cash flow and (iv) to examine the conditioning roles of culture and legal origin on the above research sub-themes. The results are summarized as follows; (i) IFRS increases the valuation role of book value of equity and overall value relevance but not earnings. These findings are consistent with the IASB (2010) conceptual framework' focus on the statement of financial position rather than the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>performance</b> in financial reporting. The results are also consistent with prior studies such as Hung and Subramanyam (2007) and Francis and Schipper (1999) which document the declining (increasing) value relevance of earnings (book value of equity), (ii) IFRS is incrementally more value relevant in code law than common law countries and (iii) the secretive culture prevalent in African countries is associated with greater BRC (lower ERC) after IFRS Moreover, consistent with prediction, the results indicate that IFRS leads to reduced gains, loss, incremental loss and overall earnings timeliness. Also, common law earnings are timelier (untimely) in recognizing bad news (good news) than code law earnings. However, this asymmetric earnings timeliness decreases after IFRS adoption. Furthermore, the results indicate that a conservative culture is associated with greater (lower) gains (loss and incremental loss) recognition timeliness. In terms of earnings and cash flow predictability, IFRS results in reduced predictive ability of cash flow and earnings. Also, cash flow dominates earnings in predicting future cash flow. Conservative culture is associated with lower (greater) predictive ability of cash flow (earnings). Moreover, results do not support the contention that IFRS increases the predictive ability of earnings and cash flow more in common than code law countries. This is the first comprehensive study examining the decision usefulness (as defined by the IASB conceptual framework, 2010) of IFRS in Africa. The conclusion is that IFRS has not improved financial reporting in Africa. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
