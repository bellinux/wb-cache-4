5|$|Fire <b>Station</b> <b>Number</b> 4 or Fire Station No. 4 is a {{historic}} fire station located at 474 Broadway in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The building historically has also been called the Collyer Fire Station. The Queen Anne Style station was built in 1890. It is a -story, hip-roofed rectangular brick building with two brick wings and a bell tower. Constructed of red brick with sandstone trim and sandstone lintels and sills on the windows, the building has a foliate terracotta plaque bearing its name and date of construction. The fire station was closed as a firehouse in 1974, when the current Fire <b>Station</b> <b>Number</b> 4 on Cottage Street opened. The interior of the building was greatly modified to accommodate offices and meeting rooms {{by the time of}} its listing on the national register. In 2014, the building is being used by the Catholic Charities of Providence. Fire <b>Station</b> <b>Number</b> 4 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The Fire <b>Station</b> <b>Number</b> 4 is architecturally {{significant}} {{as an example}} of a late 19th-century Queen Anne-style firehouse. The firehouse's distinguishing feature is the corbeled cornice and terracotta trim, but also it is historically {{significant as}} an example of Pawtucket's maturation as a city. The boundary for the property is listed as Plat 7B, lot 164 and includes the surrounding area, totaling less than one acre. Fire <b>Station</b> <b>Number</b> 4 was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 18, 1983.|$|E

25|$|The first Panel-type exchanges {{were placed}} in service in Newark, New Jersey, on January 16, 1915 at the Mulberry central office, and on June 12 in the Waverly central office. These system were semi-mechanical systems using {{telephones}} at customer stations without a dial. Operators answered calls and keyed the <b>station</b> <b>number</b> into the panel switch. The first fully machine-switching Panel systems using common control principles {{were placed in}} service in Omaha, Nebraska in December 1921, followed by the PEnnsylvania exchange in New York City in October 1922. Most Panel installations were replaced by modern systems during the 1970s and the last Panel switch was decommissioned in the Bigelow central office in Newark by 1983.|$|E
25|$|The {{panel system}} was {{designed}} to interconnect the offices of a city or a local calling area. Each office was assigned a two- (later three) digit office code. Callers dialed the office code followed by the <b>station</b> <b>number.</b> In most situations this led to six-digit (later seven) numbers. But from the beginning the panel system handled seven-digit numbers (later eight), for two reasons. Party line numbers were listed {{with one of the}} letters J, M, R, and W following the line number. The caller dialed the office code, the line number, and the digit corresponding to the letter. The panel system {{was designed to}} work with manual offices of up to 10,500 lines. To call a line in a manual office, callers dialed the office code followed by the line number, just as they would when calling a number in a fully automatic office. For lines 10,000 and up, callers therefore dialed the office code and a five-digit line number.|$|E

25|$|South West Water {{supply the}} town with water and sewage services. South Hams District Council is {{responsible}} for waste management. The town's Distribution Network Operator is Western Power Distribution. Currently the town {{along with the rest}} of Devon relies on electricity generated further north from the national grid, although Langage Power Station in Plympton is now generating. The town has two health centres: Ivybridge Health Centre and Highlands Health Centre, both located near the centre of the town. It also has four dentist surgeries: Victoria House Dental Surgery, Fore Street Dental Practice, M L Brown and Highland Dental Practice. Ivybridge is served by Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust and the nearest hospital is Derriford Hospital in Plymouth. South Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust operates in Ivybridge and the rest of the south west; its headquarters are in Exeter. Devon and Cornwall Constabulary serve the town's policing matters and there is a small police station in the centre of the town. Ivybridge has one retained fire <b>station</b> (<b>number</b> 53) on the southern outskirts of town, which is in the west division of Devon as part of Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service. It has a water tender ladder, prime mover, environmental pod and an incident support unit. The fire station used to be closer to the centre of the town.|$|E

500|$|In 1974, Fire <b>Station</b> <b>Number</b> 4 was {{replaced}} by a new Fire <b>Station</b> <b>Number</b> 4 located on 397 Cottage Street. This was not to be the only replacement of the firehouses which would be reused through the Community Development Block Grant program, which assisted in the adaptation in the late 1970s and into the 1980s. By the time of its nomination, the fire station had been re-purposed as office and meeting space for city agencies. In 2014, the property was used by the Catholic Charities of Providence for Project Hope as a [...] "Diocesan community advocacy, parish outreach and social service assistance center". In 2017, a new tenant, Rhode Island bankruptcy lawyer John S. Simonian, became a tenant in the building.|$|E

500|$|After minor repairs, Sea Cloud was rebased to Argentia, Newfoundland, {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to Weather <b>Station</b> <b>Number</b> Three. While patrolling the area on June 11, 1944, the crew spotted a Navy Grumman TBF Avenger, exchanging recognition signals. Sea Cloud received orders {{to report to the}} escort carrier [...] and join the five other escort ships under her command. The envoy searched for a raft reported in the area, but returned with no sightings. After this event, Sea Cloud was once again reassigned to Weather <b>Station</b> <b>Number</b> Four. After a search for a downed aircraft, she returned to port in Boston. Sea Cloud was decommissioned on November 4, 1944, at the Bethlehem Steel Atlantic Yard and returned to Davies, along with $175,000 for conversion to pre-war appearance.|$|E
500|$|Relieving [...] in February 1944, Sea Cloud patrolled a [...] {{area near}} the New England coast, {{generating}} weather reports for the First Naval District.

500|$|The United States Geological Survey {{operates}} {{a series of}} strong motion stations in the Imperial Valley and {{while the majority of}} stations in the array recorded ground accelerations that were not unexpected, <b>station</b> <b>number</b> six registered an unusually high vertical component reading of 1.74g which, at the time, was the highest yet recorded as the result of an earthquake. One explanation of the anomaly attributed the amplification to path effects and a separate theory put forth described supershear effects that generated a focused pulse directly at the station. A later proposal stated that both multipath and focusing effects due to a [...] "lens like effect" [...] produced by a sedimentary wedge at the junction of the Imperial and Brawley faults (under the station) may have been the cause of the high reading.|$|E

500|$|Fire <b>Station</b> <b>Number</b> 4, {{also known}} as the Collyer Fire Station, (see {{building}} plaque) [...] was constructed in 1887-1888 by H. L. Bassett & Co. and F. L. Mason on the southwest corner of Broadway and Carnation Street, in the center of Pleasant View neighborhood. The building was completed and named in 1890. The main block of the Queen Anne-styled red brick firehouse is a -story, hip-roofed rectangle with a cross-gable facing Broadway. A pair of matching single-story wings with gable-on-hipped roofs project from the long sides of the building. The building has small hip-roofed porches with arched openings on the main entrance and Broadway facing sides. Though constructed of red brick and pinkish mortar, sandstone was used for the window sills and lintels and the station's trim. The building has detailed terracotta work, with an ornate foliate name and date plaque on the front gable and a string course {{at the base of the}} corbeled main entrance. Above the plaque is a semi-circular window, and another round-headed window is on the northern side. The northwest corner has a square hose drying/bell tower that also has its own round headed window. Photos of the building are available here. The station has been modified; its two fire engine doors have been removed and replaced with modern garage doors. The pyramidal roof on the belfry which crowned the bell tower was [...] "recently" [...] removed at the time of its NRHP nomination in 1983. The interior of the firehouse has been greatly altered in the conversion to office and meeting room space by the time of its National Register of Historic Places nomination. The surviving details included the Queen Anne staircase and sunken panel doors. Though the interior has been greatly modified, it did not prevent its listing on the historic register.|$|E
