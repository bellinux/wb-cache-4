[...] "I {{was under}} the equator once, {{off the coast of}} Columbia in the bark <b>Sally</b> <b>D.</b> The captain let us go fishing in the jolly-boat. We caught about a dozen fish and threw 'em in the bottom as fast as they came in, and {{when we got back to}} the bark hang me if the first two fish we had brought up weren't baked as nice as you please, all fit for the captain's table." [...] And Caleb turned away and began to whistle softly to himself, while Si continued his ablutions without another word. Among old sailors, [...] "matching yarns" [...] is a constant pastime, and the stories sometimes told would shame even a Baron Munchausen.|$|E
6000|$|This afternoon, July 22, 1863, I spent a {{long time}} with a young man I have been with considerable, named Oscar F. Wilber, Company G, One Hundred Fifty-fourth New York, low with chronic {{diarrhoea}} and a bad wound also. He asked me to read him a chapter in the New Testament. I complied and asked him what I should read. He said, [...] "Make your own choice." [...] I opened at the close of one of the first books of the Evangelists, and read the chapters describing the latter hours of Christ and the scenes at the crucifixion. The poor wasted young man asked me to read the following chapter also, how Christ rose again. I read very slowly, for Oscar was feeble. It pleased him very much, yet the tears were in his eyes. He asked me if I enjoyed religion. I said, [...] "Perhaps not, my dear, in the way you mean, and yet may-be it is the same thing." [...] He said, [...] "It is my chief reliance." [...] He talked of death, and said he did not fear it. I said, [...] "Why, Oscar, don't you think you will get well?" [...] He said, [...] "I may, but it is not probable." [...] He spoke calmly of his condition. The wound was very bad; it discharged much. Then the diarrhoea had prostrated him, and I felt that he was even then the same as dying. He behaved very manly and affectionate. The kiss I gave him as I was about leaving, he returned fourfold. He gave me his mother's address, Mrs. <b>Sally</b> <b>D.</b> Wilber, Alleghany post-office, Cattaraugus county, N. Y. I had several such interviews with him. He died {{a few days after the}} one just described.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} supports the link between anger suppression and depression, and females' greater likelihood of demonstrating both. Anger suppression has been asserted {{to be involved in}} gender socialization for girls. Differences between boys and girls in anger suppression and depression were investigated using anger stylistic and depression measures. Differences between two grade groupings in anger suppression and depression were analyzed. Results supported the hypothesis that girls suppress anger at higher rates than boys, but not the related hypothesis that such suppression relates to higher levels of depression in girls than in boys. There were no grade-group differences in either anger suppression or depression, and no significant relationship between suppressed anger and depression for either sex. However, qualitative interview data revealed girls' gender-specific behaviors and beliefs with regard to anger, including withdrawal and expectations of diminishment by significant adults.

40|$|Weight-based {{discrimination}} and men's {{violence against women}} are critical social issues, phenomena affecting the lives of countless women, men, and children. Rates of weight-based discrimination have been compared to those of racism and adverse effects linked to weight-based discrimination include decreased wages, social isolation, low self-esteem, and elevated rates of depression. Men's violence against women causes similar and more intensive effects, including lowered self-esteem, elevated levels of anxiety, broken bones, bruises, and death. Previous research has suggested a potential link between men's violence against women and weight, but no studies to date have explicitly explored the intersection of these phenomena. The current study proposes to fill this {{gap in the literature}} through the exploration of the perception of men's violence against women while manipulating the weight of the perpetrator and victim. Participants will be asked to read a vignette involving a man engaging in violence toward a woman and view photographs of the perpetrator and the victim. Participants will also complete four subsequent measures, including a demographics form as well as batteries assessing for attribution of blame, mindset, and sentence length for the perpetrator.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{explored the}} phenomenological experience {{of living with}} chronic illness. A qualitative method involving a heuristic approach was employed, including analyst triangulation. The investigation utilized a mixed method, combining archival data analysis {{as well as new}} data collection. In addition to eight archival interviews used from a former study (Pogge, 2011), three more new interviews were conducted to expand the scope of the study. The previous investigation (Pogge, 2011) was limited to an initial, broad level content analysis calling for a more in-depth analysis for the present investigation. Therefore, a heuristic approach, which was substantially more demanding in terms of depth analysis, was employed to develop a more complex portrayal of the phenomenon of living with chronic illness. As required in heuristic inquiry, the present investigation benefited from the critical additional element of the author's own explicated personal experience and perspective of living with chronic illness. Ten composite themes were found across all 11 data sets which included: isolation versus being alone, resignation versus acceptance, external-denial versus internal coping, distancing from symptoms versus symptom management, coping, identity, trauma, power and control, uncertainty versus trust, and invisibility versus visibility of chronic illness and disability. Implications for theory, practice, research and policy/advocacy are presented. Stabb, <b>Sally</b> <b>D.</b> Fitch, JenelleTilton, AbigailAuvenshine, Michael S. Moye, Thoma...|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} began {{the development and}} validation of a measure of online gaming addiction using Facebook members. Three hundred and eighty-three participants were recruited from Facebook and from undergraduate psychology classes to complete the following questionnaires: (a) The Problematic Online Gaming Scale (POGS), (b) the Marlowe-Crowne Form C (Reynolds, 1982), (c) the Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire (PIUQ; Demetrovics, Szeredi, & Rozsa, 2008), (d) the Problematic Online Game Use scale (POGU; Kim & Kim, 2010), and (e) a demographic form. The questionnaires {{were used to assess}} the characteristics of Facebook online gamers. It was predicted that online gamers who suffer from a behavioral addiction would possess greater characteristics of salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, relapse and conflict. It was also predicted {{that there would be a}} greater feeling of social connection with other gamers in those who are more behaviorally addicted. The study found that Facebook gamers surveyed had the characteristics of conflict, mood modification, salience, social connection, tolerance and intrusive thoughts. It was also noted that different characteristics were more salient for different groups when examining gender, ethnicity, age, and other Facebook relevant demographics. Further implications of online gaming addiction are discussed. Fitch, JenelleStabb, <b>Sally</b> <b>D.</b> Hart, Christian L. Hart, Christian L. Asbury, TreyStrain, Jef...|$|E
