5|$|The {{issue of}} minimum range {{continued}} to be raised, working {{its way through the}} Air Ministry and eventually to Harold Lardner, head of what was then known as the Stanmore Research Centre. Rowe and his deputy Bennett Lewis were called to meet with Lardner to discuss the issue. Apparently without informing Lardner of Bowen and Hanbury Brown's potential solution, or the fact that they could not work on it due to the ongoing installations, they agreed to have Lewis investigate the matter. Lewis then sent a contract to EMI to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could do. According to both Bowen and Hanbury Brown, Rowe and Lewis instigated these events deliberately to pull control of the AI project from the AI team.|$|E
50|$|The Qur'an {{commands}} Muhammad (and by inference all believers) {{to continue}} the prayer regardless, as those who persecute the faithful are unaware that God <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do.|$|R
50|$|A {{report in}} 1921 in The New York Times found that of 76 {{surviving}} signatories, 60 expressed {{varying degrees of}} regret. Some claimed not to have <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had signed.|$|R

5|$|After this defeat Spinola {{took his}} {{remaining}} six galleys back to Lisbon and filled his vessels with pay chests for Flanders. During the sailing to Flanders {{he took an}} English ship, which he left at A Coruña. At Santander he took on a further 400 troops to complete the Tercio complement of 1,600 men. In England word had spread that Spinola {{was on his way}} in an attempt to run the English channel again. His heading was for Sluis with the six galleys, of whose approach was well informed by Robert Cecil even when they arrived at Blavet in Brittany at the beginning of October. Queen Elizabeth decided to act, so she appointed Sir Robert Mansell to join with the States fleet before Dunkirk and Sluis, to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could do to impeach them. Meanwhile, the States of Holland and West Frisia had sent a flotilla of nine ships under Vice-Admiral Jacob van Duyvenvoorde to intercept Spinola but when this force arrived near Spain, Spinola had already escaped to the north. Van Duyvenvoorde, coping with an outbreak of smallpox by which he was afflicted himself, sent four of his ships back north under Jan Adriaanszoon Cant, known by the English as Jan van Cant.|$|E

25|$|Researchers at the MIT Media Lab {{experimented with}} {{silkworms}} to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would weave when left on surfaces with different curvatures. They found that on particularly straight webs of lines, the worms would connect neighboring lines with silk, weaving {{directly onto the}} given shape. Using this knowledge they built a silk pavilion with 6,500 silkworms {{over a number of}} days.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, Taipei Rapid Transit System {{planned to}} build a depot on the site where now the Sanatorium is. Chen Ching-Chuan (陳京川), the ex-director of Losheng, was opposed to this decision, and did three surveys among the {{patients}} to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> thought and needed, shortly before he got demoted and reprimanded. Ever since then, the patients have had no access to the MRT construction plans and its related discussions.|$|E
25|$|It is {{one thing}} to worship a picture, it is another by means of {{pictures}} to learn thoroughly the story that should be venerated. For what writing makes present to those reading, the same picturing makes present to the uneducated, to those perceiving visually, because in it the ignorant <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> ought to follow, in it they read who do not know letters. Wherefore, and especially for the common people, picturing is the equivalent of reading.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{way of doing business}} was to make the product as and when it was ordered. This style was very slow, As Deere realized that this {{was not going to be}} a viable business model, he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale; this allowed customers to not only <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were buying beforehand, but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away. Word of his products began to spread quickly.|$|E

50|$|Other {{sightings}} {{include the}} day before the 1967 Detroit riot and before a huge snow/ice storm of March 1976, when two utility workers are said to have <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> thought was a child climbing a utility pole which then jumped {{from the top of the}} pole and ran away as they approached.|$|R
50|$|Laas {{causes a}} {{disturbance}} on the Promenade when he transforms into a fog. Emergency crews {{are sent to}} deal with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> think is a life-support malfunction, and are angered when they learn the truth. The commotion draws the attention of two Klingon officers visiting the station. <b>Seeing</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> assume is a Founder, they attack Laas with knives. Laas' shapeshifting allows him to both defend against the attack and kill one of the Klingons.|$|R
25|$|The {{stage is}} mostly bare, {{or with a}} few drama-related items. One item, called a Kalivilakku (kali meaning dance; vilakku meaning lamp), {{can be traced back}} to Kuttiyattam. In both traditions, the {{performance}} happens in the front of a huge Kalivilakku with its thick wick sunk in coconut oil, burning with a yellow light. Traditionally, before the advent of electricity, this special large lamp provided light during the night. As the play progressed, the actor-dancers would gather around this lamp so that audience could <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are expressing.|$|E
25|$|After a {{prolonged}} absence, Stalin sent a telegram expressing {{the concern that}} Eisenstein had become a deserter. Under pressure, Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclair's younger brother, Hunter Kimbrough, who had been sent along {{to act as a}} line producer, for the film's problems. Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to insinuate themselves between him and Stalin, so Eisenstein could finish the film in his own way. The furious Sinclairs shut down production and ordered Kimbrough to return to the United States with the remaining film footage and the three Soviets to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could do with the film already shot, estimates ranging from 170,000 lineal feet with Soldadera unfilmed, to an excess of 250,000 lineal feet.|$|E
25|$|The goal {{of these}} {{missions}} {{is not only}} to detect Earth-sized planets, but also to directly detect light from the planet so that it may be studied spectroscopically. By examining planetary spectra, {{it would be possible to}} determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface. Given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory, is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would look like if viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these virtual planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life.|$|E
50|$|Investigations must {{result in}} notes being kept {{and given to}} the employee. They cannot just consist of uncorroborated {{anonymous}} informants; sometimes the employee will be entitled to know his accusers and the accusations, although the employee is not entitled to know everything {{as long as he}} knows the accusation. Anonymous accusers are easy to attack anyway as there may be questions around grudges, ability to have <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say they saw and how they remember details. An employee is rarely entitled to cross-examine accusers.|$|R

25|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{replied that}} he would consent to the test since he was confident of Marie's guilt, but he felt {{there was no need}} to call on Orfila to do it. The president of the court ruled in favor of the prosecutor's suggestion. Therefore, in lieu of Orfila, two well-known apothecaries from Tulle, M. Dubois and his son, and a chemist from Limoges named Dupuytren, were assigned to conduct the tests. While they were performed, the trial proceeded at a snail's pace. When they finally entered the courtroom, everyone waited to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would say. The elder Dubois testified that despite using the Marsh test carefully, they failed to find any arsenic. Almost immediately, the courtroom was in an uproar as Marie felt vindicated.|$|E
25|$|George Profous, a {{forester}} {{for what}} had by then become the state's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) wrote in an early 1990s planning document that the aged, deteriorating tower should be dismantled and removed, not only due to its age but because, out of use, {{it was no longer}} permitted on state-owned Forest Preserve land, which New York's constitution requires be kept forever wild. Worried residents of Denning and the nearby hamlet of Claryville contacted the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development, a regional advocacy group, to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could do to save it, a development Profous had been hoping for. DEC's guidelines governing the use of the Forest Preserve do allow the retention of otherwise incompatible structures within it if they enhance the public's understanding of the Forest Preserve, and many visitors and past observers wrote about how seeing the vastness of the Catskill wildlands at once helped them appreciate the importance of protecting it.|$|E
25|$|Schiele {{was born}} in 1890 in Tulln, Lower Austria. His father, Adolf Schiele, the station master of the Tulln station in the Austrian State Railways, {{was born in}} 1851 in Vienna to Karl Ludwig Schiele, a German from Ballenstedt and Aloisia Schimak; Egon Schiele's mother Marie, née Soukup, was born in 1861 in Český Krumlov (Krumau) to Johann Franz Soukup, a Czech father from Mirkovice, and Aloisia Poferl, a German Bohemian mother from Český Krumlov. As a child, Schiele was fascinated by trains, and would spend many hours drawing them, {{to the point where}} his father felt obliged to destroy his sketchbooks. When he was 11years old, Schiele moved to the nearby city of Krems (and later to Klosterneuburg) to attend {{secondary}} school. To those around him, Schiele was regarded as a strange child. Shy and reserved, he did poorly at school except in athletics and drawing, and was usually in classes made up of younger pupils. He also displayed incestuous tendencies towards his younger sister Gertrude (who was known as Gerti), and his father, well aware of Egon's behaviour, was once forced to break down the door of a locked room that Egon and Gerti were in to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing (only to discover that they were developing a film). When he was sixteen he took the twelve-year-old Gerti by train to Trieste without permission and spent a night in a hotel room with her.|$|E
6000|$|As {{for their}} {{purposes}} being superstitious, {{we shall be}} better able to judge of that when we have <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were--what sort of a house they meant to build to God. As for their having self-interest in view, no doubt they thought that they should benefit their own souls in this life, and in the life to come. But one would hardly blame them for that, surely? ...|$|R

We tried to do this with almost all the characters in this episode: , Laura, Kara, Lee. We ripped everything out from under them then sat back to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would do. What were their individual breaking points? And if they did break, would they stay broken or grope toward a recovery? ...|$|E
500|$|For {{several days}} after 1 November, Litvinenko {{experienced}} severe diarrhea and vomiting. At one point, he could not walk without assistance. As the pain intensified, Litvinenko asked his wife to call an ambulance for assistance. For several weeks, Litvinenko's condition worsened as doctors searched {{for the cause of}} the illness. Surrounded by friends, Litvinenko became physically weak, and spent periods unconscious. A photograph was taken of Litvinenko on his deathbed and released to the public. [...] "I want the world to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> did to me," [...] Litvinenko said.|$|E
60|$|When {{the captain}} had gone out again into the open air, he was {{followed}} {{by the rest of the}} party, for, if there were no danger, they all wanted to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> was to be <b>seen.</b> <b>What</b> <b>they</b> saw was a party of six black men on the plateau, Maka in the lead. There could be no doubt that the newcomers were the remainder of the party of Africans who had been enslaved by the Rackbirds, and the desire of the captain and his companions to know how they had got away, and <b>what</b> news <b>they</b> brought, was most intense.|$|R
