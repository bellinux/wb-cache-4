40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of the CT-based non-invasive thermometry during percutaneous hepatic RF ablation in an in vivo porcine model. It should be proved that an increase of the temperature in the liver parenchyma leads to a change of the CT value. Percutaneous hepatic RF ablation was performed in four female pigs. Parallel to the used bipolar needle-shaped RF applicator (CelonLabPower) with an active tip of 30 mm (Celon ProSurge T 30) optical temperature probes (SFF- 2 m) were inserted into the liver with a fixed distance of 5, 10, 15 mm and in two pigs also with a distance of 20 mm to the RF applicator. After starting the RF ablation performed with a generator output of 20 W, unenhanced sequential CT scans of the liver were acquired using the following scan protocol: 140 kV tube voltage, 300 mAs/rotation tube current time product, collimation 24 x 1. 2 mm, rotation time 0. 5 s (SOMATOM Definition). After acquisition of the raw data, axial image data were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 1. 2 mm and the convolution kernel B 30 s using the conventional as well as the extended CT scale. Temperature was recorded continuously by the temperature probes. For analysing the CT scans a circular 0. 5 cm² region of interest (ROI) was manually placed around the tips of the temperature probes to measure local CT values. For statistical analysis mean value and standard deviation of the measured temperature change and of the change of the CT value were calculated for each animal and each temperature probe and compared descriptively. Some CT values of the four animals were investigated for the same temperature and also compared descriptively. Additionally, regression analysis was performed to analyse the relationship between local temperature changes and the measured averaged CT value. A p-value < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant (SAS Software 9. 1. 3). Descriptive analysis showed an inverse relationship between the measured temperature and the averaged CT value for all animals. The measured averaged temperature decreased with increasing distance to the RF applicator. In addition, the averaged CT value rose with increasing distance to the RF applicator. Comparing the CT values for the same temperature descriptively, interindividual differences were found. Performing regression analysis a significant influence of the temperature on the CT value was proved. With an exception of two temperature probes, negative regression coefficients were measured for the relationship between local temperature and averaged CT value. Negative regression coefficients varied between - 0. 053 HU/°C (p = 0. 4987) and - 0. 671 HU/°C (p < 0. 0001). There was no difference between the results using the conventional or the extended CT scale. The results of the study show that the CT-based non-invasive thermometry during percutaneous hepatic RF ablation is feasible in an in vivo porcine model. Using multislice CT during RF ablation, local temperature changes can be detected by a change of the CT value, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>using</b> the CT value temperature can be determined in vivo non-invasively. In conclusion, the results of this study may provide a base for a CT-based non-invasive thermometry during hyperthermal ablation therapies. However, artefacts by motion and metal hamper a precise CT-based temperature monitoring. Furthermore, the development of a more accurate and robust software-based method for a standardised analysis of the image data is required, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the CT-based non-invasive thermometry can find its way into the clinical routine...|$|R

Depending on the instantaneous channel conditions, {{one of the}} following modes is selected: direct transmission with no cooperation, cooperative transmission with half-duplex relaying and maximal-ratio combining at the destination, or cooperative transmission with full-duplex relaying and maximal-ratio combining at the destination. A three-node network is considered, containing a single-antenna source, a two-antenna relay that is able to implement full-duplex communication, and a single-antenna destination.

The results show that our scheme outperforms all of transmission modes separately in terms of outage probability, while being more energy efficient than the cooperative transmission modes.

Objective: Describe {{some of the new}} anticoagulant drugs, introduced in an attempt to overcome the limitations of traditional anticoagulant drugs (heparins, warfarin and acenocumarol). Method: Narrative literature review of relevant scientific articles published between 2006 and 2012. Results: A new strategy for the design of new antithrombotic drugs is based on selective inhibition of a specific coagulation factor, with potential to be more effective, safe and easy to use. These include direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran, bivalirudin, desirudin, lepirudin and argatroban) and factor Xa inhibitors (otamixaban, rivaroxaban, o apixaban, edoxaban and fondaparinux).

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{equilibrium}} statistical mechanics of canonical, non-canonical and non-Hamiltonian {{equations of motion}} by throwing light into the peculiar geometric structure of phase space. Some fundamental issues regarding time translation and phase space measure are clarified. In particular, we emphasize that a phase space measure should be defined {{by means of the}} Jacobian of the transformation between different types of coordinates since such a determinant is different from zero in the non-canonical case even if the phase space compressibility is null. Instead, the Jacobian determinant associated with phase space flows is unity whenever non-canonical coordinates lead to a vanishing compressibility, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> its <b>use</b> <b>in</b> order to define a measure may not be always correct. To better illustrate this point, we derive a mathematical condition for defining non-Hamiltonian phase space flows with zero compressibility. The Jacobian determinant associated with time evolution in phase space is altogether useful for analyzing time translation invariance. The proper definition of a phase space measure is particularly important when defining the entropy functional in the canonical, non-canonical, and non-Hamiltonian cases. We show how the use of relative entropies can circumvent some subtle problems that are encountered when dealing with continuous probability distributions and phase space measures. Finally, a maximum (relative) entropy principle is formulated for non-canonical and non-Hamiltonian phase space flows. Comment: revised introductio...|$|R

Unfortunately, high-fidelity simulations are computationally expensive <b>so</b> <b>that</b> their <b>use</b> <b>in</b> an automated design process based on conventional optimization algorithms is often prohibitive. Despite the availability of faster computers and more efficient simulation software: growing demand for improved accuracy and the need to evaluate larger and larger systems effectively diminishes the benefits of this increase in computing power. One of the most promising ways of alleviating these problems are surrogate-based optimization (SBO) techniques which are capable of reducing the number of expensive objective function evaluations in a simulation-driven design process. In SBO, the direct optimization of the expensive model is replaced by iterative updating and re-optimization of its cheap surrogate model. Among proven SBO techniques, the methods exploiting physics-based low-fidelity models are probably the most efficient. This is because the knowledge about the system of interest embedded in the low-fidelity model allows constructing the surrogate model that has good generalization capability at a cost of just a few evaluations of the original model. In this paper, we review one of the most recent techniques of this kind, the so-called shape-preserving response prediction (SPRP). We discuss the formulation of SPRP, its limitations and generalizations, and, most importantly, demonstrate its applications to solve design problems in various engineering areas, including microwave engineering, antenna design, and aerodynamic shape optimization...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, a QoS model for {{real-time}} interactive traffic {{on a real}} network with constrained bandwidth and real-time traffic has been proposed. The model supports tight guarantees of QoS to real-time interactive traffic without over provisioning of bandwidth. A dynamic scheduling model which is adaptive to input data rate of traffic has been proposed. In this model, A Differentiated Service (DiffServ) based approach is proposed for QoS provisioning. The packets are classified and distributed among finite number of queues with limited buffer based on different priorities and total available bandwidth. The model proposes a mechanism to derive the weighted service rates and queue length distribution so as to meet the requirement of low packet loss and delay for real time interactive traffic in the QoS engineered network. An adaptive queuing strategy is proposed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> minimum bandwidth <b>in</b> <b>used</b> for real time traffic. This ensures maximizing availability to best effort traffic. The model assumes constrained bandwidth without having to over provision the network resources and thus keeping the cost low. A modified version suitable for testing on a real network is also presented. Experimental verification of these in a test bed network in a laboratory {{as well as on}} a real network has been carried out. The results of the QoS provisioning model for different sources of real-time traffic such as video conferencing equipment, robotic surveillance camera has also been shown. The thesis also introduces a real-time Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic tuning parameter for controlling the service of VBR traffic to give better and fair performance to rest of the traffic...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{identifies}} and {{explores the}} effects that new parking strategies and policies could have on transit-oriented development (TOD) success levels. Additionally, it makes the case for TOD parking regulation reform, and is designed to educate planners and stakeholders on how to successfully and responsibly shape parking regulation in the planning and implementation process, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> land <b>use</b> <b>in</b> the region allows the synergistic provision of sustainable transportation specifically to the Boston region. Transit-Oriented Development is viewed and defined differently throughout research and literature, with its most common traits being compact, mixed use development near transit facilities and high-quality walking environments. Due to automobile dependency in the United States, developments (including TOD) are required to provide a specific level of parking to accommodate automobile usage. Excessive provision of parking decreases urban density, walkability, housing affordability, and transit ridership. In order to comply with governmental regulations and still meet TOD goals and objectives, expensive measures such as parking garages are implemented to accommodate automobile users, leading to a less affordable development and smaller profit margins for developers. An assessment of land use characteristics around transit stations, literature pertaining to TOD and current parking regulations and policies is conducted. Best practices and strategies are proposed with the overall goal of decreasing automobile-dependency and its impacts on the urban environment. Due to TOD’s heavy reliance on extensive transit systems, {{the focus of the}} study is specifically on the 101 cities and towns in the Boston metropolitan region. Somerville, MA, which contains previous transit-oriented developments and future projects in the design process, is used as a case study for transit-oriented development...|$|R
40|$|The finite {{difference}} {{time domain}} (FDTD) method {{is used to}} evaluate the radiofrequency (RF) magnetic (B 1) field in heterogeneous models of the human body as would be produced during MRI, and also to evaluate the energy absorbed by the body due to the generation of the B 1 field in human tissues. Evaluations of (1) model spatial resolution necessary to evaluate compliance with regulatory limits on Specific energy Absorption Rate (SAR) and (2) the agreement of the calculated B 1 field distribution with experimentally measured fields for similar cases are performed. Methods for calculating experimentally valuable measures of B 1 homogeneity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and SAR are presented, and methods for determining what imaging parameters can be used without exceeding SAR level limits are demonstrated. Finally, calculations are performed at several frequencies as high as 345 MHz in both a surface coil over the chest and an idealized birdcage coil over the head. The method by which FDTD models of human anatomies were created using the Visual Human Project of the National Libraries of Medicine is also presented. Pertinent values from these calculations are presented <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> future experiments <b>using</b> such coils <b>in</b> these regions, estimates of expected image B 1 homogeneity, SNR, and SAR for specific imaging parameters can be derived. It is shown that B 1 homogeneity and coil sensitivity decrease with increasing B 1 frequency. Calculated SAR levels generally increase significantly with B 1 frequency for a given set of imaging parameters. Most importantly, it is shown <b>that</b> trends <b>in</b> the B 1 field pattern, SNR, and SAR for a specific human geometry and RF coil can be calculated with fairly good agreement with experiment using the methods presented here. While further experiments and calculations are suggested to better assess the accuracy of the calculations and to improve that accuracy, the methods presented here could potentially be very useful in designing coils for <b>use</b> <b>in</b> MRI at high B 1 frequencies and in designing experiments at high B 1 frequencies that will not exceed standard limits on SAR. ...|$|R
500|$|The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, {{referred}} to as V.A.T.S., is a new element for the Fallout series and plays {{an important part in}} combat within Fallout 3. The system was introduced by Bethesda's developers, who described it as a hybrid between timeturn-based and real-time combat, <b>so</b> much <b>in</b> <b>that</b> while <b>using</b> V.A.T.S., real-time combat is paused and action is played out from varying camera angles in a computer graphics version of [...] "bullet time". Using the system costs action points (AP), the amount of which depends on the weapon being used and thus limiting the actions of the player's combat during a turn. Through the system, the player can not only switch between multiple targets (if {{there is more than one}} around at any time), but also target specific areas of them to inflict damage – a player could either target the head for a quick kill, go for the legs to slow an enemy's movements, or shoot at their weapons to disarm them; for some enemies, they can put them into a berserker rage by hitting specific parts. The chance of striking a different area, displayed as a percentage ratio, is dependent on the weapon being used, and the distance between the character and the target; a character who is a higher level when using V.A.T.S is also more likely to hit an enemy with the system than a lower level character. The use of V.A.T.S. does confer a negative effect, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> it eliminates most of the first-person shooter elements of the game; aiming is taken over by the computer, and the player is unable to move as a means of avoiding attacks. Furthermore, ranged weapons are capable of hitting limbs, while melee weapons focus on the target <b>in</b> whole when <b>using</b> V.A.T.S.|$|R
