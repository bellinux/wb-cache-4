50|$|Coupling between {{lines in}} these {{components}} is usually achieved in stripline by running the lines side-by-side for a distance. Coupling between {{the edges of}} the lines in this way is relatively weak and is limited by the closest distance the lines can be set together. This limit is governed by the maximum resolution of the printing process and, in power applications, by the electric field strength between the lines. For this reason stripline parallel coupled lines are used in directional couplers with a coupling factor no more than −10 dB but power splitters (coupling factor −3 dB) use a direct coupling technique. In air stripline there is another possibility, the lines can be stacked {{one on top of the}} other. This broadside coupling is much stronger than edge coupling so the lines do not need to be so close to achieve the same coupling factor. In dielectric supported stripline, this can be achieved by printing the two lines on opposite sides of the dielectric. Broadside coupling can, of course, be achieved in dielectric filled stripline as well with buried line techniques, but that requires additional dielectric layers and additional manufacturing processes. Another technique available to air stripline to increase coupling is the use of thick rectangular strips to increase <b>side</b> <b>coupling.</b> This also makes mechanical support easier because the lines are more rigid.|$|E

It provides confinement of a synchronous speed-of-light mode with extremely low loss. However, laser field can not be coupled into the structure collinearly with the electron beam. There are three requirements in designing input coupler for a Bragg electron accelerator: side-coupling, selective mode excitation, and high coupling efficiency. We present a <b>side</b> <b>coupling</b> scheme using a distributed grating-assisted coupler to inject the laser power into the waveguide. <b>Side</b> <b>coupling</b> is achieved by a grating with a period {{on the order of}} an optical wavelength. The phase matching condition results in resonance coupling thus providing selective mode excitation capability.

40|$|A {{simple and}} cost {{effective}} {{optical fiber sensor}} using <b>side</b> <b>coupling</b> of light into the core modes of plastic optical fiber (POF) coated with zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods is reported here. Nanorods coating enhanced coupling inside the fiber by scattering light but were also capable of causing leakage. Structuring the growth to specific regions allowed scattering from different segments along the fiber {{to contribute to the}} total coupled power. A uniform, densed and highly aligned spiral patterned ZnO nanorods were grown on the POF using the hydrothermal method and its effect was investigated. ZnO nanorods growth time of 12 h and temperature of 90 °C provided the best coupling voltage. <b>Side</b> <b>coupling</b> was measured to be a factor of 2. 2 times better for spiral patterned coatings as opposed to unpatterned coatings. The formation of multiple segments was used for multiple-wavelength channels excitation where different bands were side coupled from different segments. It was found that visible white light source significantly coupled the light into the POF compared with infrared laser sources. A first order theoretical model was derived to simulate the impact of millimeter (mm) scale spiral patterns on coupling efficiency by varying the width and spacing of the coated and uncoated regions. The width of spiral patterned ZnO nanorod coatings on POF was optimized theoretically for light <b>side</b> <b>coupling</b> and was found to be 5 mm. An experimental validation was performed to complete the optimization and the experimental results showing a well correlation with simulation. Optimized width of spiral patterned ZnO nanorods grown on large core POFs was used for the purpose of temperature and multiple optical channel alcohol vapor sensing. Spiral patterned ZnO nanorods coating exhibited a significant response to temperature change from 20 ˚C to 100 ˚C based on extinction concept which is the attenuation of light by scattering and absorption as it traverses the ZnO nanorods. Sensitivity was measured to be a factor of 1. 3 times better for spiral patterned coatings as opposed to unpatterned coating. The multiple optical channel alcohol sensing mechanism utilized changes in the output signal due to adsorption of methanol, ethanol and isopropanol vapors. Three spectral bands consisting of red (620 - 750 nm), green (495 - 570 nm) and blue (450 - 495 nm) were applied in measurements. The range of relative intensity modulation (RIM) was determined to be between 25 to 300 ppm.

40|$|Photonic {{band gap}} (PBG) fiber with hollow core defects are being {{designed}} and fabricated {{for use as}} laser driven accelerators because they can provide gradients of several GeV/m for picosecond pulse lengths. We expect to produce fiber down to {lambda} = 1. 5 - 2. 0 {micro}m wavelengths but still lack a viable means for efficient coupling of laser power into such structures due to the very different character of the TM-like modes from those used in the telecom field {{and the fact that}} the defect must function as both a longitudinal waveguide for the accelerating field and a transport channel for the particles. We discuss the status of our work in pursuing both end and <b>side</b> <b>coupling.</b> For both options, the symmetry of these crystals leads to significant differences with the telecom field. <b>Side</b> <b>coupling</b> provides more options and appears to be preferred. Our goals are to test gradients, mode content and coupling efficiencies on the NLCTA at SLAC. While there are many potential types of fiber based on very different fabrication methods and materials we will concentrate on 2 D axisymmetric glass with hexagonal symmetry but will discuss several different geometries including 2 D and 3 D planar structures. Since all of these can be fabricated using modern techniques with a variety of dielectric materials they are expected to have desirable optical and radiation hardness properties. Thus, we expect a new generation of very high gradient accelerators that extends the Livingston-Panofsky chart of exponential growth in energy vs. time at greatly reduced costs. For illustration, Fig. 1 shows a simulation of our first engineered fiber with an accelerating mode expected near 7. 3 {micro}m that is now ready to test on the NLCTA. In this example, one sees the uniform longitudinal accelerating field in the central defect as first shown by Lin 3 together with a hexagonal array of surrounding hot spots. Contrary to what one expects from the telecom field, Ng et al. have shown 4 that the ideal end-coupling scheme for this structure appears as shown in Fig. 2 with a six-fold array of laser spots focused inside the end of the fiber. While convenient for an on-axis particle beam, this is inconvenient for the laser drive field as well as the tolerances it places on the end cleave of the fiber. The importance of the crystal symmetry is clearly shown so that one might expect <b>side</b> <b>coupling</b> to reflect a similar pattern which we find that it does unless the hexagonal symmetry is perturbed sufficiently.
