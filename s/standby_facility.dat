30|$|In this paper, we have {{explored}} {{the concepts of}} the F-policy and N-policy for multi-component machining systems with warm standbys. The steady-state probability distributions established for both the F-policy and N-policy are further used to establish some performance measures such as the expected number of failed machines in the system, probability that the server is busy or idle in the system, throughput, etc. The explicit expressions of various performance measures are provided which may be further used for the improvement and performance evaluation of many real-time machining systems. The provision of warm types of standbys is a general assumption as in a special case when the failure rate is zero or {{the same as that}} of operating units, and it facilitates results for the cold standby case. The study of control policy-based models in the present investigation will be helpful in the quantitative assessment of the system’s reliability and other mean characteristics of many embedded systems such as computer networks, manufacturing systems, transportation systems, etc. In the future, we can further extend our study by considering the mixed type of <b>standbys</b> <b>facility</b> and bulk failure to make it more versatile.|$|R
40|$|This is a Loughborough University Banking Centre Research Paper. The paper {{examines}} the traditional function of commercial banks as financial intermediaries between deficit and surplus sectors. Fundamental to this function {{has been the}} assumption that banks can intermediate at lower costs than those prevailing with direct financing arrangements, but developments in corporate wholesale financing {{over the past twenty}} years or so have significantly undermined this “cost imperative” for large national and international companies. This has resulted in significant disintermediation of commercial banks by large companies and raised the question as to whether this development signals merely another evolutionary phase in modern banking or something far more fundamental. Commercial banks have responded to these changes by becoming more investment bank oriented. Traditional on-balance sheet services for large companies have, therefore, been largely replaced by the off-balance sheet activities of providing investment advice, making placements, the provision of <b>standby</b> <b>facilities,</b> etc. These fundamental changes in business activity have had a marked effect on the commercial banks' principal sources of income and the risks inherent in their business. Just as important, however, is the fact that changes in corporate wholesale banking have far-reaching implications which go far beyond the corporate wholesale market and have fundamentally changed the commercial banks' "business philosophy" and methods of conducting business...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{empirical}} {{literature on}} the economic effects of terms of trade shocks highlights not only the direct effects on growth, but also the resulting changes in volatility and debt. We link the procyclicality of sovereign debt to terms of trade shocks and provide theoretical underpinnings for <b>standby</b> <b>facilities</b> such as the “Exogenous Shocks Facility ” recently created by the IMF. By modeling international capital market imperfections and changes in creditworthiness during adverse terms of trade shocks, we show that transitions can involve excessive adjustment as debt decumulation overshoots its long run equilibrium to prolong the adjustment recession. Our model adds a novel dynamic dimension to the Harberger-Laursen-Metzler effect. In contrast to the previous terms of trade literature, we highlight that the precise nature of the capital imperfection {{is key to the}} results. When credit depends not on the level of debt but on the debt to equity ratio the model naturally features dynamic effects that are not found in previous models. It also highlights that how a country responds to terms of trade shocks depends importantly on whether the country is a creditor or debtor. Finally we assess the welfare costs associated with terms of trade shocks. For plausible parameterizations we find that a 20 percent deterioration in the terms of trade may lead to a welfare loss on the order of 10 to 15 percent. Jul...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} {{a geographical}} {{analysis of the}} role of unconventional public transport in selected rural areas of Scotland, with special reference to the Highland and the Borders Regions. The terra "unconventional public transport" has been defined, for the purpose of the thesis, as including all forms of public passenger transport other than regular conventional bus, rail and ferry services. The terra, in this context, applies to the use of smaller vehicles whose operation is wholly or partially financed or supported by the Local Authority. The forms of unconventional public transport investigated include Postbus Services, Community Bus Services, Voluntary Social Car Schemes, Dial-a-Ride, Courier Services and the use of school vehicles by fare paying passengers. A geographical analysis of the distribution of these supported schemes and their role is undertaken with special reference to the Highland and Borders Regions but set within the context of Rural Scotland and the network of conventional bus and rail services. These two regions of mainland Scotland are characterised by low population densities, a spatially dispersed settlement pattern and high levels of car ownership where the opportunities for the development of unconventional modes are considerable. The advantages of innovatory public transport in the Highland and Borders Regions have been demonstrated to be as a supplementary service, in many cases as an emergency service, as a lower cost alternative to tendered conventional bus services, as a more flexible and convenient service and in areas with relatively high levels of car ownership, as a <b>standby</b> <b>facility</b> when the family car is not available. The effects of the Transport Act 1985 are also considered but found to be of relatively little significance in influencing the number and distribution of unconventional modes despite the availability of new forms of finance from Central Government. Future prospects for unconventional public transport seem to be good especially in the field of development of the use of school transport by fare paying passengers and of courier-type services...|$|E
40|$|The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was the proudest {{accomplishment}} of President Kennedy's one thousand {{days in the}} White House. It prohibited nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space or under the oceans. The treaty was signed {{by more than one}} hundred nations, Red China and France notably excepted. Such a treaty had been a goal of United States policy for five years. In mid- 1963 a sudden change of heart by the Soviet Chairman Khrushchev made the treaty possible. Its ratification by the U. S. Senate was preceded by exhaustive hearings, lengthy debate and wide public discussion. The Secretary of Defense stated that the treaty would aid national defense but scientists and military leaders admitted it would involve serious risks. Most opinion on the treaty tended to discount the risks as being overshadowed by political gains which might result from further Russian-American cooperation. The critical question prior to the hearings was the position of the Chiefs of the military services, some of whom were skeptical of the treaty. Massive Russian atmospheric tests had broken the previous moratorium on testing, and they had not been equaled by American tests. Superior testing might have provided the Russians with superior knowledge of heavy and high altitude explosions and made possible the disabling of American weapons and communications in the air and under the ground. Senators who heard all the secret testimony before the Armed Services Committee tended to agree. Since the treaty could scarcely be ratified without the support of the military Chiefs, the President worked by various means to gain it. To do so it was necessary for him to accept a compromise worked out by Senator Jackson. He promised to reinstate a vigorous program of underground testing, which he had renounced in June, and to establish a <b>standby</b> <b>facility</b> for use in case the Russians broke the treaty as they had broken the previous moratorium. Conditional approval by the Joint Chiefs of Staff deprived opponents of a recognized authority for their stand, except for the notable testimony of Dr. Edward Teller. After ratification interest in the treaty and in nuclear problems, as well as in disarmament, subsided rapidly. Further gestures toward Russian-American cooperation resulted in dismal failure some weeks before the assassination of President Kennedy. While the treaty was hailed as a great psychological and symbolic triumph over the dangers of nuclear weapons, subsequent events have cast doubt upon its continuing value. France, and especially China, continued to test, but the treaty may have slowed the accumulation of radioactive fallout...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the outcome of}} the Sri Lanka case study on assessing the economic impact of power interruptions on industry in the South Asia region, comprising the countries of Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and India. The technical assessment evaluates the cost to the country’s economy in terms of the industrial loss due to supply interruptions and environmental impacts from standby generation used to supplement the power requirements of the industrial sector. The study found that the main economic impact of the power interruptions, both planned and unplanned, is the loss of output in the industrial sector. In a typical year of power shortages, such as 2001, arising from a deficit in generation capacity, these losses can be as high as approximately US$ 81 million a year, which is approximately 0. 65 % of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Also, the economic impact due to unplanned outages can be around US$ 45 million (0. 3 % of GDP) in a typical year. On average, these values for planned and unplanned outages are US$ 0. 66 and US$ 1. 08 per kW h of energy loss, respectively. It is also observed that 92 % of the sampled industries have <b>standby</b> generation <b>facilities</b> to satisfy either, in full or partially, their own power requirements, which produced approximately 146 GW h of energy in 2001. The serious economic and environmental impacts of power interruptions, both planned and unplanned, underlines the importance of timely implementation of the long term least cost generation expansion plan and proper maintenance of transmission and distribution networks to ensure their high reliability. Therefore, {{it is clear that the}} utility needs to take immediate steps to improve its supply reliability in order to retain consumers and justify the existence of a centralised generation facility. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{performance}} of any {{fault tolerant system}} such as computer or communication system, power plant or transmission lines, manufacturing or production and many more, is highly affected {{by the failure of}} its operating units. The breakdowns of the units may cause not only loss of production but also increase in cost. To avoid this loss and extra cost, the organization or industry can make the provision of <b>standbys</b> and repair <b>facility.</b> In some cases, if the operating unit fails, the system remains operative and continues to perform its assigned job due to switching over of failed unit by the spare part. For the smooth functioning and to achieve desired availability of the concerned system, the concepts of redundancy and maintainability have drawn the attention of practitioners as well as researchers. To reduce the maintainability and operating cost, the provision of server vacation is a key feature which has been included in many queueing models to analyze the congestion problems in different contexts. The machine repair problems with server vacations have been investigated and applied extensively in many areas including the computer and communication networks, manufacturing and inventory control processes, transportation and service sectors, etc. In many queueing scenarios of machining systems, the server is allowed to go for vacation if the system is empty. A noticeable amount of recent past works on the server vacation concept has been done by many eminent researchers (cf. Doshi 1986). Gupta (1997) proposed several server vacation schemes such as multiple vacations, single vacations, hybrid multiple/single vacation for the machine interference problems. Machine repair models with different type of policies for the server vacation have been investigated and studied by a few researchers (cf. Ke and Wang 2007; Ke et al. 2011; Ke and Wu 2012). Jain and Upadhyaya (2009) investigated the {{performance of}} multi-component machining system with multiple vacations of the servers, multiple types of redundant components and operating under N-policy. They obtained the probabilities for the system states and various key metrics by implementing the matrix recursive method. The queue size distribution has been established by Kumar and Jain (2013) for both F-policy and N-policy by employing the recursive method. Recently, Jain et al. (2015) developed multi-component machine repair model with two heterogeneous servers and having the <b>facility</b> of warm <b>standby</b> units along with on-line units. They derived the steady state queue size distributions and other measures of performance with the implementation of successive over relaxation technique.|$|R
