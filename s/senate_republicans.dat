5|$|However, {{even among}} <b>Senate</b> <b>Republicans,</b> there were {{conflicting}} views. Senators Arlen Specter and Lindsey Graham (the latter a former military prosecutor) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator John Warner suggested a cautious and deliberative response. The potential for Congressional action also provided an avenue for politicking, as Republicans threatened Democratic members of Congress with being labeled weak on terrorism {{if they did}} not authorize tribunals.|$|E
5|$|May 4, 2017, the United States House of Representatives {{voted to}} pass the American Health Care Act (and thereby repeal most of the Affordable Care Act) by a narrow margin of 217 to 213, sending the bill to the Senate for deliberation. The Senate Republican {{leadership}} announced that <b>Senate</b> <b>Republicans</b> would write {{their own version of}} the bill, instead of voting on the House version.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2009, {{a second}} motion {{to recall the}} bill from committee, {{initiated}} by Senator Les Ihara, Jr., was successful after 10Democrats voted in favor. The Senate Democratic Leadership, Democrats opposed to civil unions, and <b>Senate</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{voted in favor of}} an amendment to the bill that added language reaffirming the distinction between civil unions and marriage and allowing same-sex and opposite-sex couples to enter civil unions. The amendment was adopted, which killed the bill, as a revised version required renewed approval by the Hawaii House of Representatives and the Legislature adjourned May 8, 2009. Senate President Hanabusa stated the issue would not be taken up again before 2010.|$|E

50|$|In his {{campaign}} for President Pro Tem, Shafer won {{the backing of the}} <b>Senate</b> <b>Republican</b> Caucus at its biennial organizational meeting held at Little Ocmulgee State Park on November 15, 2012. His nominating speech before the full Senate was given by <b>Senate</b> <b>Republican</b> Leader Ronnie Chance. In a show of unity, Senate Democratic Leader Steve Henson seconded the nomination. Shafer's election was widely seen as an end to two years of infighting between Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle and a faction of the <b>Senate</b> <b>Republican</b> Caucus led by the outgoing Senate President Pro Tem Tommie Williams and <b>Senate</b> <b>Republican</b> Caucus Chairman Bill Cowsert. Williams did not seek re-election, backing Cowsert who was defeated within the <b>Senate</b> <b>Republican</b> Caucus by a reported vote of 25 to 11.|$|R
5|$|Reed's {{leadership}} in dealmaking with <b>Senate</b> <b>Republicans</b> kept the 1956 {{version of the}} flag off Perdue's statewide referendum on the flag in 2003. The referendum was originally a two-part referendum pitting the 2001 version of the flag against the proposed version and conditional on failed ratification of a new flag considering other flags including the 1956 version. Under this format if the legislators did not approve the newly designed flag over the existing one they could have pursued other designs including {{the one with the}} controversial 1956 version of the flag. Reed and a contingent of black legislators from Atlanta limited the referendum to a single vote of preference between the 2003 version and the 2001 version.|$|E
5|$|On two issues, women's suffrage, and the {{prohibition}} of alcohol, where picking the wrong side would have damaged his presidential prospects in 1920, he prospered by taking nuanced positions. As senator-elect, he indicated {{that he could not}} support votes for women until Ohio did. Increased support for suffrage there and among <b>Senate</b> <b>Republicans</b> meant that by the time Congress voted on the issue, Harding was a firm supporter. Harding, who drank, initially voted against banning alcohol. He voted for the Eighteenth Amendment, which imposed Prohibition, after successfully moving to modify it by placing a time limit on ratification, which was expected to kill it. Once it was ratified anyway, Harding voted to override Wilson's veto of the Volstead Bill, which implemented the amendment, assuring the support of the Anti-Saloon League.|$|E
5|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis {{declined to discuss}} specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, <b>Senate</b> <b>Republicans</b> said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.|$|E

25|$|Carter {{nominated}} Truesdale {{for a full}} {{five-year term}} on the Board on August 5, 1980. But <b>Senate</b> <b>Republicans,</b> convinced Truesdale was excessively pro-labor, sought to delay his confirmation until after the November elections (which Republican Ronald Reagan was expected to win). The Republicans announced in mid-August that they would filibuster Truesdale's appointment. By mid-September, <b>Senate</b> <b>Republicans</b> had adopted a much-enlarged strategy to bottle up large numbers of Carter appointees who {{would be able to}} serve past the end of the presidential term. On October 23, 1980, President Carter used his recess appointment powers to appoint Truesdale to the NLRB once again. Truesdale's recess appointment was effective only until Congress came back into session.|$|E
