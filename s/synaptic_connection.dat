25|$|NMDA receptors {{are found}} {{throughout}} the post-synaptic membrane and act as a coincidence detector. The NMDA detects both glutamate released by pre-synaptic vesicles and depolarization of the post-synaptic membrane. The NMDA receptor exhibits voltage-dependent block by magnesium ions. Depolarization of the post-synaptic membrane (i.e. backward propagating dendritic spike) causes the magnesium ion {{to be removed from}} the channel, favoring channel opening. NMDA receptor activation thereby allows calcium influx. Neurons that “fire together wire together” refer to strengthening of synaptic connections through NMDA receptors when glutamate release is coincident with post-synaptic depolarization.

50|$|In neuroscience, {{synaptic}} scaling (or homeostatic scaling) {{is a form}} of homeostatic plasticity {{that allows}} single neurons to regulate their overall action potential firing rate.

Intracellular recordings show robust increase in mEPSC amplitude (approximately 130% above control values) following 4-5 hours of TTX treatment. Longer TTX treatments yielded a more noticeable increase in mEPSC amplitude. This form of AMPA receptor trafficking is hypothesized to be directed by local mRNA transcription.|$|E
50|$|Cholinergic wave {{activity}} eventually dies out and {{the release}} of glutamate in bipolar cells generates waves. Bipolar cells differentiate later than amacrine and ganglion cells which could be the cause for this switch in wave behavior.The change from cholinergic mediation to glutamatergic mediation occurs when bipolar cells make their first synaptic connections with ganglion cells. Glutamate, the neurotransmitter contained in bipolar cells, generates spontaneous activity in ganglion cells. Waves are still present after bipolar cells make <b>synaptic</b> <b>connection</b> with amacrine and ganglion cells.|$|E
50|$|Many {{molecules}} {{have been}} implicated in synaptic plasticity. Notably, AMPA and NMDA receptors are key molecules in mechanisms of long and short-term potentiation between neurons. NMDA receptors can detect local activity due to activation and therefore modify signaling in the post-synaptic cell. The increased activity and coordination between pre- and post-synaptic receptors leads to more permanent changes and therefore result in plasticity. Hebb’s postulate addresses this fact by stating that synaptic terminals are strengthened by correlated activity and will therefore sprout new branches. However, terminals that experience weakened and minimal activity will eventually lose their <b>synaptic</b> <b>connection</b> and deteriorate.|$|E

50|$|Polysynaptic {{reflexes}} or long-loop reflexes are reflex arcs {{which involve}} {{more than a}} single <b>synaptic</b> <b>connection</b> in the spinal cord. These loops may include cortical regions of the brain as well, and are thus slower than their monosynaptic counterparts due to the greater travel time. However, actions controlled by polysynaptic reflex loops are still faster than actions which require perceptual processing. While the actions of short-loop reflexes are fixed, polysynaptic reflexes can often be regulated by instruction or prior experience. A common example of a long loop reflex is the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex observed in infants.|$|E

50|$|Another {{possible}} {{function of}} mirror neurons would be facilitation of learning. The mirror neurons code the concrete {{representation of the}} action, i.e., the representation that would be activated if the observer acted.

50|$|Synaptic {{plasticity}} {{refers to}} a chemical synapse's ability to undergo changes in strength. Synaptic plasticity is typically input-specific (i.e. homosynaptic plasticity), meaning that the activity in a particular neuron alters the efficacy of a <b>synaptic</b> <b>connection</b> between that neuron and its target. However, {{in the case of}} heterosynaptic plasticity, the activity of a particular neuron leads to input unspecific changes in the strength of synaptic connections from other unactivated neurons. A number of distinct forms of heterosynaptic plasticity have been found in a variety of brain regions and organisms. These different forms of heterosynaptic plasticity contribute to a variety of neural processes including associative learning, the development of neural circuits, and homeostasis of synaptic input.|$|E

5000|$|An axon {{is one of}} {{two types}} of protoplasmic {{protrusions}} from the cell body of a neuron; the other type is a dendrite. Axons are distinguished from dendrites by several features, including shape (dendrites often taper while axons usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them). All of these rules have exceptions, however. [...] Axons are covered by a membrane known as axolemma; the cytoplasm of axon is called axoplasm.The branched end of an axon is formed by telodendria; the swollen end of a telodendron is known as the axon terminal; which joins the dendron or cell body of another neurone forming a <b>synaptic</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hebbian {{plasticity}} and homeostatic plasticity have a hand-in-glove relationship. Neurons use Hebbian plasticity {{mechanisms to}} modify their synaptic connections within the neural circuit based on the correlated input they receive from other neurons. Long-term potentiation (LTP) mechanisms are driven by related pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuron firings; {{with the help of}} homeostatic plasticity, LTPs and LTDs create and maintain the precise synaptic weights in the neural network. Persisting correlated neural activity—without a homeostatic feedback loop—causes LTP mechanisms to continually up regulate <b>synaptic</b> <b>connection</b> strengths. Unspecified strengthening of synaptic weights causes neural activity to become unstable to the point that insignificant stimulatory perturbations can trigger chaotic, synchronous network-wide firing known as bursts. This renders the neural network incapable of computing. Since homeostatic plasticity normalizes the synaptic strengths of all neurons in a network, the overall neural network activity stabilizes.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} reflex is the monosynaptic reflex or short-loop reflex, {{such as the}} monosynaptic stretch response. In this example, Ia afferent neurons are {{activated by}} muscle spindles when they deform due to the stretching of the muscle. In the spinal cord, these afferent neurons synapse directly onto alpha motor neurons that regulate the contraction of the same muscle. Thus, any stretching of a muscle automatically signals a reflexive contraction of that muscle, without any central control. As the name and the description implies, monosynaptic reflexes depend on a single <b>synaptic</b> <b>connection</b> between an afferent sensory neuron and efferent motor neuron. In general the actions of monosynaptic reflexes are fixed and cannot be controlled or influenced by intention or instruction. However, {{there is some evidence}} to suggest that the gain or magnitude of these reflexes can be adjusted by context and experience.|$|E
