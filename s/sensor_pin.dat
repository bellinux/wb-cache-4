40|$|With {{external}} tocography {{some form}} of pressure or force transducer is fastened to the abdominal wall {{by means of an}} elastic belt. Uterine contractions produce changes in the displacement of a <b>sensor</b> <b>pin</b> which acts on the transducer, producing an electrical signal that corresponds to the relative uterine pressure. External tocography, however, has the drawback that it is subject to many factors which may influence the results of the measurement. We feel that the limitations of tocography cannot be eliminated by technical improvements of the measuring equipment, and therefore the possibility of recording the uterine contractions from the abdominal lead electromyogram (EMG) without losing any information regarding tocography has been studied. As a result of the study it has become evident that the recording of uterine activity using the EMG is more reliable than tocography and offers even additional information about the excitation and propagation of the contractions. The basic methods that have been developed and the results of clinical tests are presented here...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{navigation}} systems used for total knee replacement surgery currently require {{the insertion of}} a distal femoral reference <b>sensor</b> <b>pin,</b> which is placed anterior to posterior just superior {{to the level of}} the knee joint. There is potential for the posterior neurovascular bundle to be damaged during the insertion of this sensor device. The aim of this cadaveric study was to identify the structures at risk during insertion of the distal femoral sensor, and determine whether a safe zone for insertion could be identified. Sixteen cadaveric lower limbs (8 pairs) were studied. In each knee Steinman pins were passed from anterior to posterior, 5 cm proximal {{to the level of the}} femoral articular cartilage, directly AP and angled at 30 ° passing medially or laterally. All pins that were passed directly from anterior to posterior and from lateral to medial passed within 5 mm of a major neurovascular structure, while 62. 5 % of pins passing from medial to lateral passed within 5 mm of a major neurovascular structure. The popliteal vessels and the sciatic nerve are at risk of injury from a navigation pin or drill placed in the distal femur during knee navigation. Caution should be exercised in passing these pins and alternate methods of fixing femoral sensors should be considered...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of radiological equipment {{can be assessed}} using non-invasive methods and portable instruments that can analyze an X-ray beam with just one exposure. These instruments use either an ionization chamber or a state solid detector (SSD) to evaluate X-ray beam parameters. in Brazil, no such instruments are currently being manufactured; consequently, these instruments come at a higher cost to users due to importation taxes. Additionally, quality control tests are time consuming and impose a high workload on the X-ray tubes when evaluating their performance parameters. the assessment of some parameters, such as the half-value layer (HVL), requires several exposures; however, this can be reduced by using a SSD that requires only a single exposure. One such SSD uses photodiodes designed for high X-ray sensitivity {{without the use of}} scintillation crystals. This sensitivity allows one electron-hole pair to be created per 3. 63 eV of incident energy, resulting in extremely high and stable quantum efficiencies. These silicon photodiodes operate by absorbing photons and generating a flow of current that is proportional to the incident power. the aim {{of this study was to}} show the response of the solid <b>sensor</b> <b>PIN</b> RD 100 A detector in a multifunctional X-ray analysis system that is designed to evaluate the average peak voltage (kVp), exposure time, and HVL of radiological equipment. for this purpose, a prototype board that uses four SSDs was developed to measure kVp, exposure time, and HVL using a single exposure. the reproducibility and accuracy of the results were compared to that of different X-ray beam analysis instruments. the kVp reproducibility and accuracy results were 2 % and 3 %, respectively; the exposure time reproducibility and accuracy results were 2 % and 1 %, respectively; and the HVL accuracy was +/- 2 %. the prototype's methodology was able to calculate these parameters with appropriate reproducibility and accuracy. Therefore, the prototype can be considered a multifunctional instrument that can appropriately evaluate the {{performance of}} radiological equipment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The wood {{moisture}} content (MC) {{is vital for}} the wood performance and durability in external applications. Moisture <b>pins</b> <b>sensors</b> are widely used for measuring the MC of wood materials by measuring the electrical resistance of the material. The <b>pin</b> <b>sensors</b> are durable and respond quickly {{to changes in the}} moisture conditions in the wood. This paper presents a laboratory study of moisture pins used in an extensive field investigation on wood claddings. Attempts were made to use moisture pins for monitoring the moisture profile in the cladding boards. The quality of these measurements is evaluated and compared with gravimetric measurements. The paper also discusses the accuracy of moisture pins measurements. In order to monitor the wood cladding MC fluctuations resulting from the quick response to the ambient climate, the MC measurements in external applications should be continuous. The laboratory measurements conclude that continuous measurements of the moisture profile was not possible for coated wood cladding. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} a model is {{introduced}} {{that describes the}} charge transfer in pixels of an image sensor. The model is suitable for image sensors where lateral drift field photo detectors were implemented and considers the effects of thermal diffusion, drift due to the built-in potential gradient, and self-induced drift. The analytical result is compared with a numerical solution and confirmed by measurements. With this model {{it is possible to}} predict the amount of collected charge at the sense node for very short integration times in comparatively long pixel structures. This is particularly important for indirect time-of-flight applications with CMOS image sensors. This approach enables the optimization of the pixel layout as well as an advanced calibration that might possibly enhance the distance precision.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} radiation-induced dose and single event effects in digital CMOS image <b>sensors</b> using <b>pinned</b> photodiodes. Proton irradiations {{were used to}} study {{cumulative}} effects. As previously observed, the dark current is the main electrical parameter affected by protons. The mean dark current increase appears proportional to Srour's universal damage factor. Therefore, the degradation is mainly attributed to displacement damage in the pinned photodiode. Heavy ion tests are also reported in this work. This study focuses on single event effects in digital CMOS imagers using numerous electronic functions such as column ADCs, a state machine and registers. Single event transients, upsets and latchups are observed and analyzed.

A rotating platform surrounded by a graduated scale allowed us to rotate the sample in step of 10 °. A sliding beam was used to move vertically the magnetometer so that, combining the two movements, the sample was scanned along horizontal circles 1 cm apart along its height (Figure 2 b). At each measuring point we recorded 50 times at 50 Sample/s the three magnetic components (Vertical, Radial and Tangent) with the height and the angle.

30|$|Despite {{the range}} of {{interactions}} available due to mobile device <b>sensors,</b> passwords and <b>PINs</b> remain commonplace authentication methods due to their familiarity, ease of use {{and the existence of}} code libraries, widgets and development toolkits that support them as authenticators. The availability of development tools that support password use is bolstered by corporate policies that mandate password use on mobile devices that store or access corporate information, despite studies that have shown that these policies can produce passwords that are less secure than expected [15]. Such policies often dictate the length and required characters in a password, but do not allow for alternative authentication methods. Interestingly, corporate password policies have been shown to negatively impact employee productivity due to their strict, inflexible nature [16]. Identifying the issues and limitations of passwords with respect to mobile devices may provide information for corporations, enabling updates to their corporate policies to include authentication alternatives.|$|R

Focusing on the principle of minimalism, we investigate the use of overhead pins of various classes over a slow moving conveyor to orient polygonal planar parts. We implement a simple planner that yields sequences of static passive pins to orient a given part from a random initial state to a final orientation set. We also encounter cases in which a single final orientation is not found, and thus, we introduce the use of a force/torque <b>sensor</b> (static active <b>pin)</b> to help distinguish between the possible orientations and be able to tell which results. Limitations in orienting parts with overhead pins exist due to the complexity of the problem. Therefore, the purpose of our work is to serve as an initial study towards developing a part feeder that uses a new class of orienting devices, such as overhead pins...|$|R
30|$|The VD (or VSYNC) and HD (or HSYNC) pins {{indicate}} {{the end of}} frame and end of row, respectively. Pixel data bytes are available for sampling at the DOUT(0 [*]:[*] 7) bus at the positive edge of the DCLK signal. The EXTCLK is the clock input for the image sensor. The frequency of DCLK is half or quarter of the frequency of EXTCLK depending on {{the configuration of the}} image sensor. The initialization and configuration of the image sensor is done by the 2 -wire (SCL and SDA) I 2 C protocol. In the context of image sensor, it is often called as Serial Camera Control Bus (SCCB) interface [32]. The frame size, colour, sleep mode, and wake up mode can be controlled by sending I 2 C commands to the image sensor. The RESET is an active low reset signal for the image sensor. Some image <b>sensors</b> have a <b>pin</b> (PWDN) to control the active-sleep mode. Some HD image sensors may contain additional control pins (as shown as dotted line in Figure 2), which are used in special modes; however, these extra pins may be tied to VDD or GND or left unconnected in normal operation.|$|R
40|$|The {{closure of}} the {{abdominal}} wall after making a laparotomy is a major challenge for surgeons, since {{a significant percentage of}} closures fail and incisional hernias rise. The suture has to withstand the forces required to close the incision, while not hindering the adequate wound healing progression. Currently, there is no surgical measuring device {{that could be used to}} determine the required closing forces, which can be very different depending on the patient. This paper presents a dynamometer to measure the tension forces to be applied while closing a surgical incision, and it simultaneously measures the distance between wound edges. It is a compass-like instrument. A mechanism between the two legs incorporates a load cell, whose signal is read by an electronic device that computes the values of the tension forces between wound edges. An angular position <b>sensor</b> at the <b>pin</b> joint between legs provides the distance between both sides of the incision. Measuring capabilities of the instrument prototype were verified at the laboratory. Thereafter, its functionality was demonstrated in experimental surgery tests.

40|$|Background: This study {{compared}} {{the difference between}} patellofemoral kinematics derived simultaneously from patellar bone <b>pin</b> and skin <b>sensors</b> during full range of tibiofemoral joint movement. Methods: Movements at the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints during passive full extension-flexion of the knees in three un-embalmed human cadavers were studied with four electromagnetic tracking sensors at a sampling rate of 30. Hz. A total of four sensors were attached on distal femur, proximal tibia, {{the surface of a}} tailor-made patella mold and at the tip of a plastic bone pin planted in the patellar body through a window on the mold. Paired-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare peak motions computed from different sensors. The correlation of the movement-time curves derived from different sensors was tested by coefficient of multiple correlations (CMC) in different sections of tibiofemoral joint range. Results: Peak motions detected by skin sensor for patellar lateral tilt (p = 0. 045), distal translation (p = 0. 021), lateral shift (p = 0. 032), and anterior-posterior shift of patella (p = 0. 03 and 0. 01 respectively) were higher than that by the bone <b>pin</b> <b>sensor.</b> The overall CMC values for anterior-posterior translation and medial-lateral shift were lower than movements in other planes of movement. The CMC values in initial range were higher than that in the middle and end range in all planes of movement. Conclusions: Patellofemoral kinematics derived from skin sensors may not be representative of the underlying patellar motion. Kinematics reported from the skin sensors should be carefully interpreted. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Gait {{analysis}} and human joint motion measurement {{has been studied}} extensively in the recent past. Common approaches {{that have been used}} include using inertial sensors, multi-camera optical and IR tracking systems, X-ray and fluoroscopy based imaging, force sensors, magnetic <b>sensors</b> and bone-fixed <b>pins</b> for measurement. Soft tissue artifacts (STA) are a common source of error in most type of measurements and the standard procedure in gait analysis has been to use a combination of measurement methods for efficient estimation of joint angles and the link poses. However, there are few studies where a multiple number of methods have been compared and the correlation between results from various approaches studied. In this paper, we propose an outline for measurement for human joint motion using a number of sensors that can give complete information relating to the joints. Our proposed experiment assumes a human joint to be a 6 DOF joint between 2 links. We will mount collars on the limbs close to anatomical landmarks, treating the actual pose of the system with respect to the bones as unknowns. These collars will hold markers and sensors that will be used in the experiments. We will be using a 10 camera optical (IR) tracking system, accelerometers and gyroscopes, 7 wire passive measurement system, 7 wire active measurement system, in-shoe pressure pads, variable length resistive wires, collar-mounted force sensors, and IR distance sensor to measure the pose of the trunk.

40|$|Wood {{is a major}} {{structural}} material used {{in the construction of}} residential and commercial buildings. In situ and continuous measurement of moisture in a wood element of the building envelope is critical in preventing the occurrence of moisture related damages to the building structure, and also helps in determining the thermal and energy performance of the system. Moisture content of a wood assembly may serve as an indicator of the effectiveness and potential condensation-related damage to the adjoining thermal insulation layers in the building envelope. Typically, the moisture content in a wood component is determined by measuring the electrical resistance across a pair of metallic <b>pin</b> <b>sensors,</b> with correlation or calibration between resistance and moisture content already established for the studied wood species. As the wood dries from fiber saturation point (FSP) to equilibrium moisture content (EMC), the resistance typically increases by 4 orders of magnitude from hundreds of k to G. Typical resistance measurement instrumentation schemes such as voltage divider and multimeters are often incapable to cover this wide dynamic range of resistance. To further complicate the measurements, low EMC values of 5 %- 10 % range correspond to very high resistances in the range of M-G, a regime that has remained challenging to measure because of lower current and leakage issues. To circumvent these issues, we developed an instrumentation methodology based on a simple voltage divider circuit in combination with a data-logger with reference resistors selected in such a manner to maximize the dynamic range of the measurement with sufficient accuracy and resolution for higher resistance range. The results showed significant improvements in the dynamic range and resolution for the MC measurements...|$|R
