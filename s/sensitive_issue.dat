5|$|One of {{the main}} issues during the {{election}} was the ban {{of the use of}} the word 'Allah' in Christian publications. However, the Sarawak police has banned political parties from using the issue during campaigning in the by-election as it was deemed to be a <b>sensitive</b> <b>issue.</b> Sarawak's Officer in Charge of Criminal Investigations, Huzir Mohamed, threatened to prosecute offenders of the ban under the Sedition Act or the Internal Security Act (ISA).|$|E
5|$|The {{borders in}} South-east Alaska were disputed between the US, Canada and Britain since the American {{purchase}} of Alaska from Russia in 1867. The US and Canada both claimed the ports of Dyea and Skagway. This, {{combined with the}} numbers of American prospectors, the quantities of gold being mined and the difficulties in exercising government authority in such a remote area, made {{the control of the}} borders a <b>sensitive</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nouakchott was a tiny, {{fortified}} {{fishing village}} (ksar) in pre-colonial times and under French rule. As Mauritania prepared for independence, it lacked a capital {{city and the}} area of present-day Nouakchott was chosen by Moktar Ould Daddah and his advisors. Ould Daddah desired for the new capital to be a symbol of modernity and national unity which ruled out existing cities or towns in the interior. The village {{was selected as the}} capital city for its central location between Saint-Louis, Senegal, the city from which the colony of Mauritania was governed, and Nouadhibou. Its location also meant that it avoided the <b>sensitive</b> <b>issue</b> of whether the capital was built in an area dominated by the Arab-descended Moors or Black Africans.|$|E
40|$|In natural {{resource}} management facilitation literature, little {{attention is paid}} to <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> in multi-stakeholder interaction and learning. This article aims to fill this gap. It discusses the variety of discursive strategies used by stakeholders to address <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> with regard to fishery management in Benin, in three different settings: individual interviews, homogeneous groups' discussions, and a heterogeneous group meeting. <b>Issues</b> that proved <b>sensitive</b> were discussed openly in the interviews or homogeneous groups' discussions, but not at all, or only indirectly, in the heterogeneous group meeting. With indirect discursive strategies, two out of the seven <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> were put on the discussions' agenda. We conclude that the other <b>issues</b> were too <b>sensitive</b> among others because of historically grown interdependency between interventionists and fishers. We suggest that dealing with <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> is an important dimension of the facilitation of interactive learning processes and provide methodological guidelines to detect and address such issues...|$|R

As the early 1960s wore on, this increasingly <b>sensitive</b> <b>issue</b> contributed to the deterioration of relations between Phnom Penh and Washington.|$|E
25|$|Beauty {{contests}} {{have been}} criticised for reinforcing {{the idea that}} girls and women should be valued primarily for their physical appearance. This is an especially <b>sensitive</b> <b>issue</b> for naturists as being contrary to the naturist philosophy of body-acceptance of all body types, and that women are not there to be looked at. Beauty contests are no longer as common {{as they were in}} the 1950s and 1960s in mainstream naturist venues.|$|E

40|$|Despite growing {{interest}} in learning and teaching as emotional activities, there is still very little research on experiences of <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues.</b> Using qualitative data from students {{from a range of}} social science disciplines, this study investigates student’s experiences. The paper highlights how although they found it difficult and distressing at times, the students all valued being able to explore <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> during their studies. The paper argues that it is though repeated exposure to <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> within the classroom that the students became more comfortable with the issues. This process of lessening sensitivity {{is an important part of}} the journey through higher education. It will argue that good student experiences need not always be positive emotions...|$|R

While it has some ties with Italy, the events surrounding World War II, when Istria changed hands between the Kingdom of Italy and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, remain pertinent. Numerous Italian politicians expressed their discontent concerning the inability of Italians to purchase land in Croatia, considering it discriminatory treatment and stating that the issue should be resolved as soon as possible.|$|E

25|$|The rampant {{inflation}} situation {{is considered a}} politically <b>sensitive</b> <b>issue</b> in Uzbekistan, {{which is why the}} Uzbek government is slow to acclimate the currency to its current value by issuing higher coin and note denominations. As a result, the current highest coin denomination in circulation is the 500 soʻm while the highest banknote denomination is the 50,000 soʻm. Official state figures put inflation as {{of the first half of}} 2011 at 3.6%, however accurate numbers are pinned far higher. Coins and banknotes below 25 soʻm are practically worthless now.|$|E
25|$|Questions {{of public}} policy. In {{analyzing}} the factors, {{the subject matter}} of the complaint may touch on a <b>sensitive</b> <b>issue</b> that is important to the laws of either the original jurisdiction or the alternative forum. Those public policy issues must be pinpointed, analyzed and briefed in a way that makes it clear why this issue overrides the other factors. For example, an employee suing a foreign corporation in a state of employment, may enjoy the public policy to protect local employees from foreign abusers. See the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA) for further reference.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{and other}} NATO states often ignore this <b>sensitive</b> <b>issue,</b> likely because of {{potential}} effects on their war strategy in Afghanistan. Their involvement could strain relations and jeopardise their own national {{interests in the}} area. This came after the November 2011 NATO bombing in which 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed. In response to that incident, Pakistan decided to cut off all NATO supply lines as well as boost border security by installing anti-aircraft guns and radars to monitor air activity.

25|$|The {{demographics}} of Quebec constitutes {{a complex and}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>issue,</b> especially {{as it relates to}} the National Question of Canada. Quebec is the only province in Canada to feature a francophone (French-speaking) majority, and where anglophones (English-speakers) constitute an officially recognized minority group. According to the 2011 census, French is the First Official language spoken of more than 85.5% of the population while this number rises to 88% for children under 15 years old. According to the 2011 census, 95% of Quebec is francophone, with less than 5% of the population not able to speak French.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Joint Forces Command {{noted in}} a December 2008 report {{that in terms of}} {{worst-case}} scenarios, Mexico bears some consideration for sudden collapse in the next two decades as the government, its politicians, police, and judicial infrastructure are all under sustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels. The Joint Forces Command is concerned that this internal conflict will {{have a major impact on}} the stability of the Mexican state over the next several years, and therefore would demand an American response based on the implications for homeland security alone. After the JFC broached this <b>sensitive</b> <b>issue</b> in its 2008 report, several journalists and academics subsequently discussed in print the possibility that Mexico could become a failed state.|$|E
25|$|On December 25, 1991, Ang Totoong Buhay ni Pacita M. {{was part}} of the 1991 Metro Manila Film Festival. The film tells the story of Pacita M., a singer-entertainer in a seedy Quezon City nightclub whose {{daughter}} Grace {{was shot in the head}} by a stray bullet just as she was preparing to go off to college. Although initially Pacita held out for a miracle to save her daughter form her vegetative state, eventually she relents and seeks to allow Grace a dignified death by turning off her respirator. The emotional battle becomes a personal epiphany for Pacita. This highly acclaimed movie directed by Elwood Perez bravely tackles the <b>sensitive</b> <b>issue</b> of euthanasia. Aunor won numerous awards for her performance, including the Metro Manila Film Festival Best Actress, her fourth Gawad Urian, and her third consecutive Best Actress trophy from the Film Academy of the Philippines. She won from Star Awards and from the Young Critics Circle.|$|E

40|$|Researchers {{exploring}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> need {{to obtain}} {{valid and reliable}} information. This may necessitate participants not being sensitised to the precise research focus to prevent contamination of findings. In this paper research exploring feelings of trust and distrust and emotional responses to organisational change is used to assess how a concurrent mixed methods design, utilizing a constrained card sort and in-depth interview, can enable such <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> to be researched without sensitising participants. This illustrative example provides instructive guidance regarding how to apply this mixed method. It also reveals how feelings of trust and distrust and emotional responses are directly associated with positively and negatively interpreted change situations rather than misappropriated, highlighting reasons for these responses including the role of managers. The paper concludes by considering how this mixed methods design can support researching such <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> in organisations...|$|R
25|$|When in 1590 Justus Lipsius {{retired from}} the University of Leiden, the {{university}} and its protectors, the States-General of the Netherlands and the prince of Orange, resolved to appoint Scaliger his successor. He declined; he hated lecturing, and there were those among his friends who erroneously believed that {{with the success of}} Henry IV learning would flourish, and Protestantism would be no barrier to his advancement. The invitation was renewed in the most flattering manner a year later; the invitation stated Scaliger would not be required to lecture, and that the university wished only for his presence, while {{he would be able to}} dispose of his own time in all respects. This offer Scaliger accepted provisionally. Midway through 1593 he set out for the Netherlands, where he would pass the remaining sixteen years of his life, never returning to France. His reception at Leiden was all that he could have wished for. He received a handsome income; he was treated with the highest consideration. His supposed rank as a prince of Verona (a <b>sensitive</b> <b>issue</b> for the Scaligeri; see below) was recognized. Leiden lying between The Hague and Amsterdam, Scaliger was able to enjoy, besides the learned circle of Leiden, the advantages of the best society of both these capitals. For Scaliger was no hermit buried among his books; he was fond of social intercourse and was himself a good talker.|$|E

[...] Above-ground retorting typically consumes between one and five barrels of water per barrel of produced shale oil, depending on technology.
