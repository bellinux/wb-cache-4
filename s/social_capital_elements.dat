The data {{used in the study}} was generated using a structured questionnaire in a survey that covered 321 households in Kenya’s semi arid districts of Machakos and Taita-Taveta Districts. Two modelling strategies were used: A Probit model was used to estimate the likelihoods of factors that may influence farmers’ perception of soil erosion problem, and a Tobit to estimate parameters of factors that influence terracing intensity. The results indicate that although {{perception of the}} soil erosion problem is relatively high in the study sites, its effect on soil conservation investments is not significant. In Machakos, the significant determinants of terracing intensity include land tenure, crop area, household size, and membership diversity whereas in Taita-Taveta they include age of household head and consumer-worker ratio. Results from the aggregated data show that lagged crop output, group membership density and diversity, cognitive social capital and location significantly influence the terracing intensity on farm household fields. The policy challenge is to establish and strengthen <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> <b>elements</b> that have a strong influence on communities undertaking soil erosion control measures for sustainable agriculture and rural development. ...|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{corporate}} <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> formulations {{have been}} based on a firm’s positioning within its network of market place alliances. This paper extends this model by incorporating firm status attributes of intellectual capital and corporate reputation into an integrated model for corporate <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> An empirical study of some 155 firms in the global Information Technology sector was conducted, exploring the linkage between <b>elements</b> of corporate <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and firm performance. A key contribution of this research is the specificity of the linkages identified between particular aspects of corporate <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and firm performance. The results find that money matters, with financial soundness being the most predictive corporate <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> <b>element</b> for firm performance. Beyond financial soundness, a firm’s market network centrality and human capital were significant predictors. For large or profitable firms, centrality was found to be a liability and internal capital an asset, in terms of firm performance. In contrast, for small or loss making firms the opposite is true, where centrality is an asset and internal capital a liability. Additionally, the direction of influence of centrality could change depending on which performance measure is used...|$|R

40|$|Managing Protected Areas (PAs) is a {{challenging}} task, and globally many instruments have been utilised for this purpose. Existing research {{demonstrates that the}} effectiveness of these instruments is highly dependent on their social acceptability among local communities resident within PAs. Consequently, investigating local attitudes and perceptions of Protected Area (PA) policies has been emphasised in recent studies. Drawing on empirical work conducted in two National Parks including river delta ecosystems designated as Ramsar wetlands in northern Greece, this paper examines local residents’ perceptions of three hypothesized policy options (regulatory, market-based and participatory) for Park management. The influence of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> <b>elements</b> (social trust, institutional trust and social networks) on residents’ perceptions is explored. The findings reveal a high degree of importance attached by resident communities to Park designation in both PAs, though residents’ perceptions of the proposed management options varied. The regulatory option was regarded as the least restrictive, while the most restrictive was perceived to be the market-based option. However, greater benefits were identified by residents from the market-based option, while the fewest benefits were considered to arise from the proposed regulatory option. Furthermore, local residents’ perceptions were significantly shaped by the proposed management and decision-making structure offered under each policy option. The influence of different <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> <b>elements</b> on residents’ perceptions also varied in the study sample, with social trust and institutional trust positively correlated with the benefits that were perceived to arise from the different policy options. Moreover, when social capital was measured as an aggregate indicator {{at the level of the}} individual, it was positively correlated with perceived environmental benefits...|$|E

40|$|The {{level of}} {{effectiveness}} {{of an environmental}} policy depends to a significant degree {{on the level of}} acceptance and cooperation of citizens. The relevant literature indicates that social capital may significantly influence environmentally responsible behaviour connected with the implementation of an environmental policy. In this context, the present article aims to further explore this field by introducing the issue of non-economic social costs and benefits imposed from environmental policies. In particular, it is supported, both theoretically and empirically, that social costs and benefits may influence the decision of individuals to cooperate and comply with an environmental policy and thus may be a significant indicator for environmental behaviour. Furthermore, these social costs and benefits may differ among individuals and are influenced by <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> <b>elements.</b> Consequently, through the article the need of exploring social capital prior to environmental policy implementation is underlined along with the need of creating social capital assessment techniques. ...|$|E

As a result, the paper determines particular aspects of trust such as accountability, shared norms and the ability to take responsibility to be interrelated with the usage of employee competences and underlines a positive connection between product innovation performance and trust. However, the trust concept needs enriching elements to be balanced towards a feeling of mutual reliance and support creativity instead; inclusions of bridging <b>social</b> <b>capital,</b> <b>elements</b> of distrust and a pioneering spirit are to be mentioned here...|$|E

40|$|The {{last twenty}} years saw the idea of ‘social capital’ blossoming as a popular and {{promising}} new look at phenomena in the social sciences. Essentially a theory that explains how and why relational networks are important {{for the production of}} outcomes at the individual and collective level, research into the creation and productivity of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> can form a powerful additional perspective for the investigation of inequality questions. Nevertheless, several unresolved issues and ambiguities regarding the application of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> theory still remain. One of these is its measurement. This dissertation studies the operationalisation and measurement of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> at the level of individuals, where it is defined as the collection of resources owned by members of social network of individuals, which may become available for use as a result of investments in personal relationships. A first part of this research comprises a general prologue to measurement: a consideration of <b>social</b> <b>capital’s</b> conceptual <b>elements</b> (alters, their resources, and their willingness to give access to these resources), the possible mechanisms through which social resources may become productive, and the danger of confounding <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> measurement by an emphasis on measuring the mobilisation of social resources. A calculative section discusses several ideas for the construction of single and multiple sets of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> indicators for individual social networks, focusing on theoretical arguments (specificity, volume, and diversity) as well as explorative empirical investigations. Summarised, this first part aims to identify the usefulness of several properties of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> measurement for prospective future research into the productivity, goal specificity, and distribution over the population of domain-unspecific <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> for individuals in Western, industrialised countries. The second part of this study is empirical: it investigates the structure of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> using several measurement instruments currently available: the Name Generator/interpreter combination, the Position Generator, and the newly constructed Resource Generator instrument. Using data from the 1999 - 2000 ‘Survey on the Social Networks of the Dutch’, four consecutive chapters study theoretical and practical features, and measurement properties of each of these instruments. An overall comparison of data from all instruments shows that <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> comprises five main dimensions, and that each measurement instrument emphasises different dimensions. Summarised, {{the second part of the}} study shows that different <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> measurement instruments measure very different aspects of social resources embedded in social networks. This implies that older data collected with different measurement instruments are incomparable, but that future research could benefit from the unique measurement properties of each instrument. On the basis of these results, a concluding measurement strategy is proposed for the use of both existing data and future <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> data collection. ...|$|R

Adaptation is a dynamic social process: the ability of societies to adapt is determined, in part, by the ability to act collectively. This article reviews emerging perspectives on collective action and <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and argues that insights from these areas inform the nature of adaptive capacity and normative prescriptions of policies of adaptation. Specifically, <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> is increasingly understood within economics to have public and private elements, both of which are based on trust, reputation, and reciprocal action. The public-good aspects of particular forms of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> are pertinent <b>elements</b> of adaptive capacity in interacting with natural capital and in relation to the performance of institutions that cope with the risks of changes in climate.

It uses data from a survey of 321 households in Machakos and Taita-Taveta Districts. A Heckman's two-step model is applied to assess the influence of social capital on investments in soil conservation by farmers. Results show that the education level of the household head, slope of farmers' fields, proportion of off-farm income, and the status of soil erosion are significant determinants of the likelihood of farmers recognizing soil erosion as an important problem.

40|$|Providing {{development}} inputs like {{electrical energy}} {{is a formidable}} task {{in many parts of}} the developing world. The generally rural nature of developing countries makes it necessary to devise innovative ways of getting electricity to the non-urban majority. It is also imperative that adequate and productive electrical power is made available, for sustainable development to be achieved by rural communities and by extension the national economies. Therefore, institutional and other innovations are being continuously mooted to meet the challenges; and it is in this context that rural electricity co-operatives have been introduced to developing countries. The co-operatives are promoted largely because of their social strengthening characteristics. However, questions arise as to whether <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> upon which the co-operatives are based is a facilitator or an impediment to the co-operatives, and the sustainable development that is ultimately targeted. It is argued in this paper that rather overstretched virtues of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> mask undesirable <b>elements</b> of the <b>capital.</b> Importantly, organizations like co-operatives that depend on it can fail because of the neglected dark aspects. Empirical evidence from Kenya is used to support the contention.

This study aims to empirically explore how women managers benefit from social networks in the information technology (IT) field in China and Finland. Guanxi, an Eastern term for social networking, has seldom been studied in terms of gender and career, especially within cross-cultural research. <b>Social</b> <b>capital</b> is a Western term for social networks. Using questionnaires, in-depth interviews and interpretive analysis, we compare the composition and structure of social networks used by women managers within the information technology sector in the two countries. The results show: (1) that in both contexts, there is an effect of female-to-male dyads, which are mainly within power- and work-related networks (e. g. most ties of ‘influence’ are with older men) while female-to-female dyads are mostly ‘social’, (2) China has relatively small networks while Finland has networks differentiated {{on the basis of}} function, and (3) there are differences in the structure and participant strategies in networks and networking in the two contexts. Both guanxi and <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> include <b>elements</b> of who know you” and “who knows you” that are important for career success. We suggest that a strategic and cross-gender, cross-company approach to networking would assist women in career advancement.

Along the years of concepts development experts have found a common ground that the definition of social capital {{can be seen in the}} context of a social relation of the actors in achieving their common goals. Many empirical researches had been conducted to study social capital in the agricultural development to learn the <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> <b>elements</b> in mutual trust reciprocity and network. Many researches also had found that higher social capital level in people organization or community contributes to a better agricultural development outcome. Therefore social capital becomes one of the significant elements in pursuing development objectives and accountabilities through stakeholders social interactions...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} extent to which social capital is an approach used by New Zealand’s Rural Education Activities Programmes (REAPs) to contribute to rural education. Social capital was defined {{for the purposes of this}} study as the resource residing in networks of individuals, based on mutual trust and shared social norms, which can be brokered and mobilised to achieve social benefits, particularly in the application of knowledge and skills. A conceptual framework lays out four key elements from this definition which were investigated: networks, trust, social norms, and brokerage. Given the lack of published material on REAPs and their work, a primarily qualitative design was utilised. Set within a constructivist epistemology and interpretive phenomenological methodology, in-depth interviews with REAP managers and questionnaires for REAP learners were used to collect data. The aim was to explore the lived experiences of these two REAP groups to identify their views on how REAPs operate so that those views could be considered within the social capital framework above. An inductive-deductive-inductive analysis approach was used to maximise {{the extent to}} which findings reflected participant language. Findings from both REAP managers and learners supported the strong presence of the four <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> <b>elements</b> in REAP activity. In many cases the qualitative themes were closely related, both within and across the four <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> <b>elements.</b> Both strong (social) and weak (institutional) forms of trust were described as influencing learner participation in networks, where REAPs played a role in brokering that participation within similar (bonded) and differing (bridged) networks. REAPs made use of trusted relationships and valued-based decision making to gain local community and cultural knowledge to ensure the relevance of responsive learning activities. The result was enhanced confidence and identity of learners to take part in other social activities, including further learning and collective action. Lived examples of these elements supported a social capital approach that fit well with the lifelong learning and community development processes outlined by the REAP mandate. These processes were defined holistically to consider the integration of individuals’ beliefs, viewpoints, and behaviours as much as skills and knowledge. The explored social capital approach within lifelong learning and community development contexts, yields clear recommendations for Government, REAPs, and partner organisations. Flexibility, values/identity-based education, and closing network gaps to facilitate innovation come through as REAP social capital practices that could inform policy and partnerships across the whole of the education sector. Further research is needed to more closely consider the complex relationships of the identified social capital themes. In terms of emergent themes, a deeper exploration of innovation produced through brokerage within REAP activity is highlighted as a key area of research for future...|$|E
40|$|To develop public {{policies}} that respond {{to climate change}} demands examination of multiple physical and social variables. In the context of coastal zone management, these range from addressing prevailing environmental conditions, to accommodating the socio-economic needs of local communities and acknowledging the attitudes, norms and environmental behaviours of individuals. This paper focuses on these social aspects and develops an explanatory framework to model the effectiveness of coastal management policies based {{on the role of}} social capital. Although some studies have emphasised the positive influence of social capital on natural resources management, so far little research has been undertaken linking social capital as a multi-dimensional characteristic with the level of public receptiveness to policies seeking to mitigate risk at the coast. This paper analyzes the influence of three <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> <b>elements</b> on public responsiveness: social trust, institutional trust and social networks. The paper postulates that higher levels of social and institutional trust result in more positive community perceptions of proposed policies for coastal management. Similar reactions are expected in communities where dense social networks lead to higher levels of environmental awareness. The paper then identifies potential new areas of research that might address the current lack of consideration of non-economic social costs and benefits on public acceptability of coastal management policies. A principal claim made here is that higher levels of policy acceptability are generally evident in coastal communities with strong social capital, as such communities tend to perceive low social costs and high benefits arising from policy intervention. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the fi ndings of our EU co-funded project, an idea developed {{to better understand}} the opportunities to formalize corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in a clustered system. Small companies often have to compete in a global market; for this reason, cooperation among SMEs, and with local stakeholders and intermediary institutions, might be facilitated by a collective answer to new market requests. Cooperation and <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> are key <b>elements</b> to facilitate trust amongst involved local actors. Moreover, they can also {{play a key role in}} the formalization of CSR policies and practices for small companies. In our project, we aimed at identifying and understanding the role of the ‘intermediary institutions’ (such as trade unions, local authorities, business consortia) in the cluster. Throughout the paper, we focus on the analysis of three industrial clusters in Tuscany (Italy). Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment...|$|R
40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>capital</b> {{has become}} a popular term {{over the past two}} decades amongst researchers, policy makers and {{practitioners}} from varied disciplines. This popularity, however, has resulted in a great deal of confusion over the nature and application of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> in different contexts. This confusion has made it difficult to identify and measure <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> within the evaluation of specific social and health programmes, one of the aims of which may be to stimulate <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> This paper identifies a theoretical model that seeks to capture the dynamic nature of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> to assist in the development of research methods that will facilitate its measurement and exploration within such programmes. The model reported in the paper identifies the key components of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and expresses the relationship between those components in a dynamic system based on Marx's description of the process of capital (economic) exchanges expressed in the M-C-M' cycle. The M-C-M' cycle is the transformation of money (M) into commodities (C), and the change of commodities back again into money (M') of altered value. The emphasis within the paper is on the <b>capital</b> <b>element</b> of the concept and its transactional nature with the aim of avoiding the pitfall of attributing <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> in relation to social behaviours in isolation of context and interaction. Importantly, the paper seeks to distinguish the central <b>elements</b> of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> from some of the antecedent factors and outcomes often attributed to and confused with <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> adding to the problem of providing valid measurement. The model is presented as the basis for the measurement of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> within a transactional process involving the investment of social resources in a cyclical process, which may result in net gains or losses. This process is described as the R-C-R' cycle following Marx's model of economic capital, with the focus being on the transfer of social resources (R) rather than money (M). R represents an internal resource held by individuals, C the external resource or commodity they obtain from the network and the R' the internal resource of altered value. The possibilities of the model in assisting in the measurement of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> specifically in assessing formal networks are explored. <b>Social</b> <b>capital</b> M-C-M' cycle Marx...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} {{which focuses on}} the existing body of literature covering the construct of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and fundamental human need theories, particularly the need to understand and find meaning. It examines these in relationship to learning, culture and activity theory. The study is a preliminary investigation with limited scope. The thesis establishes an explanatory analysis and accompanying conceptual framework to be tested by further research. A proposed meth 9 dology for data collection and ·analysis is included. The thesis takes a humanistic approach and proposes that fundamental human need satisfaction is foundational to human well-being and growth within people's varied lifeworlds. The study reveals that human interactions and value systems connect the concepts of <b>social</b> <b>capital,</b> fundamental human need and culture {{in the form of}} activities surrounding fundamental human need satisfaction. Regarding the construct of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and its <b>elements</b> of shared values, trust, norms, reciprocity and networks, the structural, relational and cognitive dimensions of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> are proposed and examined. This thesis suggests that the <b>elements</b> of the <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> construct work together to facilitate human interactions aimed at satisfying fundamental human needs across different socio-cultural systems. It places particular mphasis on the learning process required to negotiate the range of socio-economic need satisfactions across different cultures. Tue study also discusses theories surrounding communitarian psychology as a precursor to the introduction of activity theory. Activitxi theory in this thesis is explained as a learning model emphasising human activity aimed at the satisfaction of fundamental human needs. This thesis further develops the activity theory model to demonstrate the role <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> plays as a resource. A resource, which when accessed, acts as a mediator of human interaction aimed at enabling the satisfaction of fundamental human needs. This model directly links human values to human activity-and stresses the link between human values, human action, and the satisfaction of fundamental human needs. The model demonstrates how human values have a direct effect on how a person perceives need-satisfying activities and what resources can be accessed and used in any activity. This thesis's explanatory analysis and associated conceptual :framework give rise to a set of propositions, questions and hypotheses. The thesis underpins and justifies the significance of, and need for, a future cross-cultural study for which a methodology is proposed. This proposed future study places at its centre the importance of human values as a pivotal point around which <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> is generated and maintained...|$|R
