Fumarate exerts its activating effect by decreasing the off-rate for malate from the E:Mg:malate and E:Mg:NAD:malate complexes. The activation by fumarate results in a decrease in K_imalate {{and an increase in}} V/K_malate by about 2 -fold, while the maximum velocity remains constant.

40|$|Fluorescence {{properties}} of four new potential antitumoral compounds, 3 -arylbenzothieno[2, 3 -c]pyran- 1 -ones, were studied in solution and in lipid membranes of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (Egg-PC) and dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DODAB). The 3 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) benzothieno[2, 3 -c]pyran- 1 -one (1 c) exhibits the higher fluorescence quantum yields in all solvents studied. All compounds present a <b>solvent</b> <b>sensitive</b> emission, with significant red shifts in polar solvents for the methoxylated compounds. The results {{point to an}} ICT character of the excited state, more pronounced for compound 1 c. Fluorescence (steady-state) anisotropy measurements of the compounds incorporated in liposomes of DPPC, DODAB and Egg-PC indicate that all compounds have two different locations, one due to a deep penetration in the lipid membrane and another corresponding to a more hydrated environment. In general, the methoxylated compounds prefer hydrated environments inside the liposomes. The 3 -(4 - fluorophenyl) benzothieno[2, 3 -c]pyran- 1 -one (1 a) clearly prefers a hydrated environment, with some molecules located at the outer part of the liposome interface. On the contrary, the preferential location of 3 -(2 -fluorophenyl) benzothieno[2, 3 -c]pyran- 1 -one (1 b) is {{in the region of}} lipid hydrophobic tails. Compounds with a planar geometry (1 a and 1 c) have higher mobility in the lipid membranes when phase transition occurs.

40|$|Furfural is an {{important}} chemical <b>solvent</b> and intermediate. <b>Sensitive</b> detection of this compound has attracted great interest in various fields. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a highly sensitive method for material detection because of its optical enhancement effect of plasmonic nanostructures. This study presents a simple and versatile method to synthesize a SERS substrate, where polyaminothiophenol (PATP) was used to realize the stable combination of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and Au film via self-assembly. The near-field electric field distribution was calculated using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation to determine the parameters responsible for electric field enhancement. The simulation results show that SERS enhanced factors are sensitive to interparticle spacing and materials for solid support but insensitive to particle size. Moreover, the experimental {{results show that the}} optimized substrates with the highest Raman activity were formed by six layers of 60 [*]nm AuNPs decorated on a 30 [*]nm thick Au film, thereby validating the simulation results. The SERS factor of the optimal substrates is approximately 5. 57 × 103, and the in situ detection limit is 4. 8 [*]ppm. The 3 D Raman spectra, relative standard deviation values for major peaks, and changes in signal intensity with time show the good reproducibility and stability of the substrates...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of the gerE 36 mutation in strains of Bacillus subtilis 168 resulted in poor germination of their spores {{in a range of}} germinants, as measured by the fall in absorbance of spore suspensions. Although resistant to heat and organic <b>solvents,</b> spores were <b>sensitive</b> to lysozyme; electron microscopy revealed that their coat structure was incomplete. These spores responded to germinants by losing heat resistance and changing from phase bright to phase gray. The release of dipicolinic acid and the fall in absorbance of spore suspensions reached only 75 and 50 % of wild-type levels, respectively, but followed the same time course as the loss of heat resistance. Although the germination response was incomplete, the concentration of L-alanine required to elicit it was the same for the mutant as for the wild type. The properties of mutant spores suggest that an intact spore coat is not required for the initial interaction between germinant and spore, but that the coat layers may contain molecules important in later stages of germination. In transduction with phage SPP 1, the gerE 36 mutation mapped between citF and ilvB and was 90 % cotransduced with citF 2. The gerE mutation identifies the location of a gene important for the progress of late stages of spore formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} of proteins by asparagine deamidation and aspartate isomerization {{is one of}} several chemical degradation pathways for recombinant antibodies. In this study, we have identified two solvent accessible degradation sites (light chain aspartate- 56 and heavy chain aspartate- 99 / 101) in the complementary-determining regions of a recombinant IgG 1 antibody susceptible to isomerization under elevated temperature conditions. For both hot-spots, the degree of isomerization was found to be significantly higher than the deamidation of asparagine-(387, 392, 393) in the conserved CH 3 region, which has been identified as being <b>solvent</b> accessible and <b>sensitive</b> to chemical degradation in previous studies. In order to reduce the time for simultaneous identification and functional evaluation of potential asparagine deamidation and aspartate isomerization sites, a test system employing accelerated temperature conditions and proteolytic peptide mapping combined with quantitative UPLC-MS was developed. This method occupies the formulation buffer system histidine/HCl (20 mM; pH 6. 0) for denaturation/reduction/digestion and eliminates the alkylation step. The achieved degree of asparagine deamidation and aspartate isomerization was adequate to identify the functional consequence by binding studies. In summary, the here presented approach greatly facilitates the evaluation of fermentation, purification, formulation, and storage conditions on antibody asparagine deamidation and aspartate isomerization by monitoring susceptible marke...|$|R
