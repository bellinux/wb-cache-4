Here it is {{proposed for the}} first time, that <b>self-orthogonal</b> <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes</b> (SOCCs) might be a candidate solution moving forward. Analysis is conducted that shows the performance comparisons between both un-coded systems and those which employ Hamming codes. The specific metrics used herein are with respect to coding gain and critical distance. The results show that a (3, 2, 13) SOCC provides the largest coding gain compared with all Hamming codes over a BER range of 10 - 5 to 10 - 9 and furthermore, also has the shortest critical distance...|$|R
40|$|FEC codes mainly {{consist of}} two major categories: Block <b>Codes</b> and <b>Convolutional</b> <b>Codes.</b> The major {{difference}} between them is that <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes</b> have memory bits whereas block codes do not. In general, FEC codes add redundancies to the original information so that the receiver can detect and correct errors appeared during transmission. Error correcting capability is vital since in FEC codes it is not practical to resend information changed by the channel noise. As a result, high performance FEC codes should be implemented to mitigate effect of noise and any unwanted signals. Similar to orthogonal block <b>codes,</b> <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes</b> can be designed as orthogonal codes. Considering orthogonality of <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes,</b> {{it is possible to}} apply them in construction of concatenated codes. The main advantage of orthogonal <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes</b> is the ability to decode by majority logic decoding. This technique is simple, efficient, and easy to implement. In this project, various codes will be studied, but the focus will be on the design of <b>self-orthogonal</b> <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes</b> and on decoding them by using majority logic decoding.

40|$|Abstract — For 100 Gb/s optical {{transport}} network, {{researchers are}} searching a suitable error correction coding scheme {{that can provide}} coding gain more than 10 dB at the bit error rate less than 10 − 12, provided that the redundancy does not exceed 20 percent. This paper presents a least complex error correction coding scheme based on iterative threshold decoding called multi-stage threshold decoding with difference register (MTD) for the 100 Gb/s optical transport network. High rate (code rate 0. 8) <b>self-orthogonal</b> <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes</b> are considered. The MTD achieves lower bound error performance of maximum likelihood decoding at higher bit energy to noise density ratio. The codes with orthogonal checking 10 and larger satisfy the requirements of 100 Gb/s optical transport network. The bit error rate of MTD with parity check decoding becomes less than 1 / 100 times in the error floor region compared to ordinary MTD. The MTD based decoding with parity check decoding for the code with orthogonal checking 12 produces 10. 60 dB coding gain at the bit error rate 10 − 15. The coding gain further improves 0. 25 dB in the waterfall region by using 2 -step decoding.

40|$|Generalized {{tail-biting}} (GTB) convolutional encoding {{has been}} presented {{as a means to}} ameliorate the rate deficiency caused by zero-tail convolutional encoding. This GTB encoding provides a block structure for <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes</b> without sacrificing any rate loss. Two special schemes of GTB are discussed. The first scheme uses the full constraint length (m) of information blocks as tails and is called full tail-bating (FTB) encoding. The second scheme uses m 2 ̆ 7 (0 3 ̆c m 2 ̆ 7 3 ̆c m) information blocks as tails and is called partial tail-biting (PTB) encoding. ^ Using the generator matrix characterization, an equivalence relationship is developed between binary rate k/n <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes</b> and quasi-cyclic block codes of period n. This relationship is utilized to design both good systematic <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes</b> and block codes. These codes are then compared with existing good codes. ^ Maximum likelihood (optimum) Viterbi-like decoding is developed for the classes of FTB and PTB codes. This scheme basically performs exhaustive searches (by Viterbi decoding trials) for the code word that satisfies the FTB or PTB encoding constraint. Therefore, two suboptimum decoding schemes are proposed to reduce the decoding complexity of the FTB codes. They are both focused upon the important task of estimating the starting state of the transmitted sequence. ^ The decoding performance of both optimum and suboptimum decoding schemes for the binary symmetric channel are then evaluated using a transfer function technique, a Viterbi FTB decoding analysis method, and simulations. ^ A design procedure is presented for synthesizing threshold decodable, rate 1 /n and n/(n + 1), self-orthogonal block codes obtained from truncating <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes</b> by GTB. When GTB is applied to an equal error protection threshold decodable <b>convolutional</b> <b>code,</b> the result is a class of unequal error protection threshold decodable block codes. These codes are related to a class of unequal error protection codes previously described by Mandelbaum 75. Furthermore, the codes of Mandelbaum are generalized. Finally, a relationship between quasi-cyclic self-orthogonal blocks <b>codes</b> and tail-biting <b>self-orthogonal</b> <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes</b> is discussed. ...|$|R

The issues considered are mainly {{related to the}} physical layer of the networks, i. e., the topology and the optical communications problems. The following approaches were considered in more detail: photonic switching using spatial light modulators; subcarrier-multiplexing techniques using direct optical detection, {{and in particular the}} transmission of 64 -QAM signals by optical fibre; and subcarrier-multiplexing techniques combined with coherent optical detection. The spatial light modulator appears {{to be one of the}} most promising means for building a large-size (e. g., 1000 × 1000) optical space switch. The main constraints are the attenuation of the optical signal and the crosstalk between the channels. Other problems such as fan-in and fan-out are also addressed. Theoretical and experimental results are presented on the fibre-optic transmission of microwave 64 -QAM signals at 90 Mb/s rate.

By character-error-correcting, we mean that the code is character oriented, where each character {{can be thought of}} as a string of binary or higher base symbols of fixed length or as a single nonbinary symbol of correspondingly higher base.

Lower bounds on the burst-error-correcting capability for both BCSOC and CCSOC are found. Decoding consists of a mixture of majority logic decoding and algebraic computation. The decoding algorithm seems practical if either the rate expansion factor k or the number of errors corrected t are not large. Such codes are most suitable for channels with both random and burst noise, and also effect a compromise between the cost of terminal equipment and the efficient use of channels...|$|R

It would therefore appear {{that we are in a}} good position to make a fair comparison of the Viterbi decoding complexity of block and <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes.</b> Unfortunately, however, this comparison is somewhat muddled by the fact that some <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes,</b> the punctured <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes,</b> are known to have trellis representations which are significantly less complex than the conventional trellis. In other words, the conventional trellis representation for a <b>convolutional</b> <b>code</b> may not be the “minimal” trellis representation. Thus ironically, we seem to know more about the minimal trellis representation for block than for <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes.</b> We provide a remedy, by developing a theory of minimal trellises for <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes.</b> This allows us to make a direct performance-complexity comparison for block and <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes.</b> A by-product of our work is an algorithm for choosing, from among all generator matrices for a given <b>convolutional</b> <b>code,</b> what we call a trellis-canonical generator matrix, from which the minimal trellis for the code can be directly constructed. Another by-product is that in the new theory, punctured <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes</b> no longer appear as a special class, but simply as high-rate <b>convolutional</b> <b>codes</b> whose trellis complexity is unexpectedly small...|$|R
