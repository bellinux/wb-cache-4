In December 2003, McVie went to see Fleetwood Mac's last UK performance on the <b>Say</b> <b>You</b> <b>Will</b> tour in London, but did not join her former bandmates on stage. Mid-2004 saw the release of McVie's new solo album, In the Meantime, her third in a career spanning five decades. Recording in her converted barn in Kent, she worked on the project with her nephew, Dan Perfect, who contributed guitar-playing, backing vocals, and songwriting. No tour was organized to promote this album; instead McVie conducted several press interviews in both Britain and the United States.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{elements}} of the film were considered to bear a resemblance to a 1960s Japanese anime television series, Jungle Emperor (known as Kimba the White Lion in the United States), with characters having similar analogues, and various individual scenes being similar in composition to the show. Matthew Broderick believed initially that he was, in fact, working on an American version of Kimba since he {{was familiar with the}} Japanese original. However, The Lion King director, Roger Allers, claimed he was unfamiliar with the show: [...] Co-director Rob Minkoff also stated that he was unfamiliar with it: [...] "I {{know for a fact that}} [...] has never been discussed as long as I've been on the project... In my experience, if Disney becomes aware of anything like that, they <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> not do it. People are claiming copyright infringement all the time." [...] He also stated that whenever a story is based in Africa, it is [...] "not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird or hyenas." [...] Yoshihiro Shimizu, of Tezuka Productions, which created Kimba the White Lion, has refuted rumors that the studio was paid hush money by Disney but explains that they rejected urges from within the industry to sue because, [...] "we're a small, weak company. It wouldn't be worth it anyway... Disney's lawyers are among the top twenty in the world!" ...|$|E

As of 2013, Fleetwood Mac is again touring as a four-piece band throughout North America, Europe, and the UK; the [...] "Live World" [...] tour commenced on April 4, 2013, in Columbus, Ohio. On April 30, the band released their first new studio material since 2003's <b>Say</b> <b>You</b> <b>Will</b> via digital download on ITunes with the four-track EP containing three new songs from Buckingham and one new song from the Buckingham Nicks sessions ("Without You").|$|E

2500|$|A {{subsequent}} fourth solo album, entitled Gift of Screws, {{was recorded}} between 1995–2001 and presented to Warner Bros./Reprise for release. [...] Executives at the label managed to persuade Buckingham {{to hold the}} album back and instead take several tracks from Gift of Screws and use them with Fleetwood Mac. Thus, seven songs from Gift of Screws appear on the Fleetwood Mac album <b>Say</b> <b>You</b> <b>Will,</b> in substantially the same form as Buckingham had recorded them for his solo release. Bootleg copies of Gift of Screws—taken from an original CD-R presented to Warner Bros/Reprise—are known to exist and have been widely distributed among fans {{through the use of}} torrent sites and other peer-to-peer networks.|$|E

2500|$|While {{assembling}} {{material for}} a planned fourth solo album in the mid-1990s, Buckingham contacted Mick Fleetwood for assistance on a song. Their collaboration lasted much longer than anticipated, and the two eventually decided to call upon Stevie Nicks, John and Christine McVie. The band's old chemistry was clearly still there, and plans for a reunion tour were soon in the works. In 1997, Buckingham and all four of his bandmates from the Rumours-era line-up of Fleetwood Mac went {{on the road for}} the first time together since 1982 in a reunion tour titled The Dance. The tour was hugely successful and did much to heal the damage that had been done between Buckingham and his bandmates. However, Christine McVie left the band in 1998 because of her fear of flying and to be with her family in the UK, thus making the band now a foursome. In 2003, the reformed band released the first studio album involving Buckingham and Nicks in 15 years, <b>Say</b> <b>You</b> <b>Will.</b> Buckingham's song [...] "Peacekeeper" [...] was the first single from the album, and the band went on a world concert tour that would last almost a year and a half.|$|E
2500|$|The Water Babies, a {{fairy tale}} for a land baby by Charles Kingsley (serialised in Macmillan's Magazine 1862–63, {{published}} in book form, with additions, in 1863). Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin's On the Origin of Species, having [...] "long since... learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species", and the story includes a satire on the reaction to Darwin's theory, with the main scientific participants appearing, including Richard Owen and Huxley. In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley's five-year-old grandson Julian saw the illustration by Edward Linley Sambourne (right) and wrote his grandfather a letter asking: Dear Grandpater– Have you seen a Waterbaby? Did {{you put it in}} a bottle? Did it wonder if it could get out? Could I see it some day?– Your loving Julian. Huxley wrote back: My dear Julian– I could never make sure about that Water Baby... My friend who wrote the story of the Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever. Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did– There are some people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things.When you grow up I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be one of the great-deal seers, and see things more wonderful than the Water Babies where other folks can see nothing.|$|E
