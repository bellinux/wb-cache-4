5|$|A third {{story is}} set in San Diego, where an {{undercover}} DEA investigation led by Montel Gordon (Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Guzmán) leads {{to the arrest of}} Eduardo Ruiz (Ferrer), a high-stakes dealer posing as a fisherman. Ruiz decides to take the dangerous road to immunity by giving up his boss: drug lord Carl Ayala (Bauer), the biggest distributor for the Obregón brothers in the United States. Ayala is indicted by a tough prosecutor, hand-selected by Robert Wakefield to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mexican drug organizations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the court}} case, Huseby {{stated that he}} wanted help from society and {{attention}} drawn to his cause. However, he stated that he regretted doing this by hijacking. He stated that {{all he wanted was}} to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> minister of justice and prime minister that he needed help, and that he did not intend that the other passengers be aware of his threats. Huseby stated that the hijacking was spontaneous and that he planned to make an armed robbery or take hostages at the Radisson SAS hotel in Oslo. His defence lawyer argued that Huseby did not commit a hijacking in the letter of the law, but had instead taken hostages, which would result in a lesser sentence. The court psychologists stated that Huseby had a difficult childhood, and had been defined as an alcoholic at the age of 17. They considered him to have very underdeveloped ability to make rational decisions and weak mental health. They also stated that he committed crimes to identify himself due to his low self-esteem. On 29 May 1986, Huseby was found guilty of hijacking in Eidsivating Court of Appeal. He was sentenced to three years prison and five years of preventive supervision.|$|E

With all the dialogue in English, Pridi hoped to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outside world that he was unhappy with the militaristic direction his country was taking. The film depicts the story of an ancient Siamese king who only goes to war after he's been attacked.|$|E

25|$|In many animals, {{aggression}} can {{be linked}} to pheromones released between conspecifics. In mice, major urinary proteins (Mups) have been demonstrated to promote innate aggressive behavior in males, and can be mediated by neuromodulatory systems. Mups activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. Pheremones have also been identified in fruit flies, detected by neurons in the antenna, that <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain eliciting aggression; it has been noted that aggression pheremones have not been identified in humans.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{introduced}} as a post-release add-on for SQL Server 2000, Notification Services was bundled {{as part of}} the Microsoft SQL Server platform for the first and only time with SQL Server 2005. SQL Server Notification Services is a mechanism for generating data-driven notifications, which are sent to Notification Services subscribers. A subscriber registers for a specific event or transaction (which is registered on the database server as a trigger); when the event occurs, Notification Services can use one of three methods to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> subscriber informing about the occurrence of the event. These methods include SMTP, SOAP, or by writing to a file in the filesystem. Notification Services was discontinued by Microsoft with the release of SQL Server 2008 in August 2008, and is no longer an officially supported component of the SQL Server database platform.|$|E

[...] In the rejected design, MacNeil's Liberty leans forward, an olive branch extended in her left hand, but her right hand holding the hilt of a broadsword.

500|$|A {{separate}} [...] "Proposed Agreement on the Sending of Communications to Extraterrestrial Intelligence" [...] {{was subsequently}} created. It proposes an international commission, membership {{of which would}} be open to all interested nations, to be constituted on detection of extraterrestrial intelligence. This commission would decide whether to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extraterrestrial intelligence, and if so, would determine the contents of the message on the basis of principles such as justice, respect for cultural diversity, honesty, and respect for property and territory. The draft proposes to forbid the sending of any message by an individual nation or organization without the permission of the commission, and suggests that, if the detected intelligence poses a danger to human civilization, the United Nations Security Council should authorize any message to extraterrestrial intelligence. However, this proposal, like all others, has not been incorporated into national or international law.|$|E

500|$|During the Iraq War Jackson {{admitted}} {{that the war was}} putting the service under strain, but called the claim that the Army was [...] "at breaking point", [...] "nonsense". Jackson was dismissive of claims that the Army was under-equipped, recalling his conversation with a soldier: [...] "There's a bit of a fuss going on about boots and bog rolls and whatnot. Are you all right for boots?" [...] He later conceded that this could be seen as [...] "cavalier", and that he [...] "had no intention of belittling the gravity of the situation", but that he [...] "didn't want to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> enemy that we were in any way not ready". Known for speaking his mind, Jackson attracted media attention towards the end of his tenure as CGS in 2006, when he criticised Norman Kember for Kember's apparent lack of gratitude to the soldiers who freed him from Iraqi kidnappers.|$|E
500|$|Jailed activist Zainab al-Khawaja smuggled {{a letter}} from prison in which she called people to {{participate}} in Tamarod protests.

Zainab's father, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja who is also jailed delivered a message via Mohammed al-Maskati of Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) in which he called for [...] "a peaceful Tamarrod on August 14th ... under the banner of 'Right to Self determination'." [...] Another jailed rights activist, Nabeel Rajab also announced his support for Tamarod protests. [...] "I call for rebellion [...] against all laws that violate the rights of the people.

Fearing for his life, he tries to steal a gun from the ship's weapons locker, but is confronted by Captain Stone. Stone dares Merriam {{to try to get the}} support of the crew, but Merriam is rebuffed in this effort. This changes when Radioman Winslow (Edmund Glover) {{receives}} a radiogram asking if Merriam is on board, and Captain Stone orders Winslow to lie, replying that Merriam is not aboard. [...] The radioman shows Merriam the captain's reply radiogram and says that he now mistrusts the captain and will <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company expressing his concerns about Stone's mental health. However, as he leaves Merriam's cabin, Winslow encounters the captain. As the two walk side-by-side, Winslow drops the captain's radiogram to the deck, and it is picked up by an illiterate crewman, Finn the Mute (Skelton Knaggs), whose internal monologues serve as a sort of one-man Greek chorus throughout the film.|$|E

500|$|Cortana {{returns in}} the third {{installment}} in the Halo series, the 2007 Xbox 360 game Halo 3. During gameplay, Cortana appears to the player in broken transmissions, often reciting lines from Fall of Reach and earlier games. Cortana manages to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Master Chief on Earth through a [...] Flood-infected ship. In her message, she states that Gravemind is unaware of the portal opened by a Forerunner artifact on Earth. Cortana continues to appear to the Chief, who later recovers her from Flood-controlled High Charity. Surprised that the Chief has against all odds rescued her (as promised) Cortana produces the Index from Installation 04, which she has kept as a souvenir. With it, Cortana activates a new ringworld being constructed. While the Flood are destroyed as planned, the slipspace portal through which Master Chief, the Arbiter, and Cortana attempt to escape collapses, thus stranding the Chief and Cortana. Cortana activates a distress beacon, but she knows that years could pass before rescue comes. As the Master Chief prepares to go into cryonic sleep to await rescue, Cortana confides to him that she will miss him. He replies to wake him when she needs him.|$|E
500|$|Robben was inflicted {{with yet}} another injury in a match against Liverpool on 20 January 2007. Robben made his return in a 3–0 victory against Middlesbrough in February, driving in a shot that took a {{deflection}} past Mark Schwarzer for an own goal by Abel Xavier. He came on {{as a substitute for}} Claude Makélélé in the 2007 League Cup final against Arsenal and set up the winning goal for Didier Drogba. Robben scored a goal {{in the second round of}} the Champions League against Porto, which led to Chelsea winning the tie 3–2 on aggregate. At the end of March 2007, Robben underwent a knee operation after sustaining a knee injury upon returning from international duty that was expected to rule him out for at least four weeks. He only made two further appearances for Chelsea, both of which were as a substitute and both of which would prove to be key games for the club. His first appearance since returning from injury was against Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final second leg which went to penalties. Robben went on to have his penalty saved by Pepe Reina, and Chelsea ultimately lost. His final appearance for the club came against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup Final. Robben replaced Joe Cole at half-time, but was then substituted himself for Ashley Cole in extra time as Chelsea emerged victorious. Spanish club Real Madrid were interested in two of Chelsea's players. Then manager Bernd Schuster is said to have demanded Michael Ballack, while Real Madrid's then president Ramón Calderón was known to favour Robben. Robben said to reporters of Spanish newspaper AS, [...] "I do not know when a deal will be reached.
