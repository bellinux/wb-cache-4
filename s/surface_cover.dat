40|$|Abstract—Soil {{has been}} proven as a {{promising}} cooling source in arid region, yet it has underperformed in hot-humid tropical countries. This paper aims to investigate the cooling performance (soil temperature) in hot and humid regions under the enhancement of different porous materials such as gravel woodchips and rice husk. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the materials. In the first experiment, {{the performance of the}} <b>surface</b> <b>covered</b> by these materials was compared with other surface conditions such as the empty surface and the <b>surface</b> <b>covered</b> by a building model. The soil temperature at the depth of 0. 25 m and 1. 00 m below the <b>surface</b> <b>covered</b> by wood chips is the lowest, 0. 8 °C and 0. 4 °C lower compared to the soil temperature of the empty soil surface. In the second experiment, the porous materials were examined under the desired radiation intensity (1000 Wm- 2) from a halogen lamp. The soil <b>surface</b> <b>covered</b> 2 cm-thick and 5 cm-thick wood chips is 3 °C and 4 °C lower than the soil <b>surface</b> <b>covered</b> by gravel. The soil under the 2 -cm-thick rice husk has the lowest temperature. Its soil surface is 1 °C lower than the soil <b>surface</b> <b>covered</b> by 5 cm of wood chips.

500|$|Marsh shrews {{typically}} live in wetlands (such as marshes), {{and their}} habitat includes extensive forest canopy and ground cover from shrubs, logs, and debris; {{they may also}} be found in riparian environments. [...] During cold, rainy seasons, they may travel as much as a kilometer from wet areas to more sheltered habitats; these generally include mixed deciduous or coniferous forest with downed logs and <b>surface</b> <b>cover.</b> Marsh shrews have been collected from near sea level to as high as [...] in the Cascades. They may inhabit forests of red alder, bigleaf maple, western hemlock or redcedar, often near marshes with western skunk cabbage. In British Columbia the marsh shrew is generally found below , but it has been collected at [...] in Mount Seymour Provincial Park. Environmental officials in British Columbia believe that marsh shrews are one of the rarest small mammals in the province. In 1992, Carlos Galindo-Leal and Gustavo Zuleta trapped 1,000 small mammals at 55 locations in a large area of southwestern British Columbia; only three were Pacific water shrews.|$|E
2500|$|The NRCS {{has shown}} contour strip {{cropping}} provides the greatest effectiveness when {{slopes of the}} area are within 4-8%. For greater success in lowering the erosion, contour strips on the slopes need to follow {{the contours of the}} landscape. Row crops like corn, legumes, or soybeans should alternate strips of small grains or forages to successfully limit erosion and slowing or capturing the runoff of fertilizers and pesticides. [...] Tests from the NRCS have shown that the smaller tighter rooted grasses and hays provide more <b>surface</b> <b>cover</b> to prevent rain and wind erosion while slowing runoff, increasing infiltration, and trapping sediment from the high erosive row crops. Proper planting of the contour crops is important for higher success of erosion control to protect highly fertile topsoil.|$|E
2500|$|An {{essential}} {{feature for}} the formation of laterite is the repetition of wet and dry seasons. Rocks are leached by percolating rain water during the wet season; the resulting solution containing the leached ions is brought to the surface by capillary action during the dry season. These ions form soluble salt compounds which dry on the surface; these salts are washed away during the next wet season. Laterite formation is favoured in low topographical reliefs of gentle crests and plateaus which prevents erosion of the <b>surface</b> <b>cover.</b> The reaction zone where rocks are in contact with water—from the lowest to highest water table levels—is progressively depleted of the easily leached ions of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. A solution of these ions can have the correct pH to preferentially dissolve silicon oxide rather than the aluminium oxides and iron oxides.|$|E

50|$|Hispid cotton rats {{occur in}} grassy areas or early-successional {{habitats}} within open woods. In the Southeast hispid cotton rat population density increases with {{the density of}} broomsedge (Andropogon virginicus) and other low growing plants, but declines with succession to brush and trees. In Texas pine-hardwood forests, hispid cotton rats were captured most often in narrow streamside management zones which have more light and thus more ground cover, and slightly less often in wider zones. In longleaf pine-slash pine stands of central Louisiana hispid cotton rats were captured in sawtimber, sapling, and regeneration stands but not in pole-sized timber; standswith <b>surface</b> <b>cover</b> {{were more likely to}} support hispid cotton rats. Pole-sized timber is dense, little light reaches the ground, and <b>surface</b> <b>cover</b> is minimal. In Louisiana and Mississippi, hispid cotton rats were more numerous in cut than in uncut bottomland hardwoods. They were also more numerous in cottonwood (Populus spp.) plantations than in uncut cottonwood stands. In northern Georgia intensive site preparation following clearcutting of pine-hardwood mixtures increases forage production and increased numbers of small mammals (presumably including hispid cotton rats).|$|E
