5|$|There are {{numerous}} actors who have either appeared on The Bill for <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> length of time, or on whose careers The Bill {{has made a}} significant impact. The following is a concise list of the most notable, an expanded version is available at List of characters of The Bill.|$|E
5|$|Churchill Machine Tools (Coventry) Ltd (company {{registration}} 00087969) was liquidated in 1974. The {{significance of}} this company is uncertain but the low registration number indicates that the entity, even if not using the particular name, had existed for <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> time: by the 1950s new companies were being issued numbers around the 00500000 region, and by the 2000s this had become a series starting around 01400000.|$|E
5|$|On July 15, 2014, Nowitzki re-signed {{with the}} Mavericks to a {{reported}} three-year, $25 million contract. He was also reunited with former championship teammate Tyson Chandler, who {{was traded to}} Dallas after a 3-year stint with New York. Also to come over from New York was point guard Raymond Felton. The Mavericks made big strides in the off-season to put Dirk with <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> talent, signing a rising small forward Chandler Parsons and veteran point guard Jameer Nelson. The Mavericks later signed former championship teammate J. J. Barea after the Timberwolves waived him.|$|E
5000|$|John Bell stated their founder's {{name was}} Stork, a disciple of Luther, and that [...] "this sect was <b>some</b> time <b>considerable</b> in Germany".|$|R
50|$|Among Tozer's {{unpublished}} recordings are <b>some</b> of <b>considerable</b> historical interest, {{such as his}} recording {{with the}} tenor Gerald English of Sir Michael Tippett's song cycle Boyhood's End.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The whole {{length of}} the beach here is backed by a berm of stones, <b>some</b> of <b>considerable</b> size, which have presumably been piled up by winter storms.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the outward}} {{terminal}} {{of the line}} {{was to be the}} quay at Watchet, the west pier had been practically unusable for <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> time, and boats were beached and loaded direct from carts brought on to the foreshore. After considerable public pressure, the Watchet Harbour Act was passed in 1857, placing it under the control of Commissioners; they built a new east pier and rebuilt the west pier; the work was finished in 1862, and 500ton vessels could enter the harbour. The WSMR used the west pier, and the newly arrived, broad gauge West Somerset Railway, a branch from the Bristol and Exeter Railway, used the east pier.|$|E
5|$|The English Civil War {{resulted}} in Parliament issuing orders to slight or damage many castles, particularly in prominent royal regions. This was {{particularly in the}} period of 1646 to 1651, with a peak in 1647. Around 150fortifications were slighted in this period, including 38town walls and a great many castles. Slighting was quite expensive and took <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> effort to carry out, so damage was usually done in the most cost-effective fashion with only selected walls being destroyed. In some cases the damage was almost total, such as Pontefract Castle which had been involved in three major sieges and in this case {{at the request of the}} townsfolk who wished to avoid further conflict.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies {{can last}} for <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> time, growing slowly over a month. Mushrooms in subalpine and alpine areas are {{typically}} heavy-set with a short stipe, their growth slower in the cold climate. This latter form is seen at lower altitudes in colder seasons. Smith gave this the name forma rainierensis. Conversely, mushrooms at low altitudes, {{such as in the}} redwood forests, can grow and expand rapidly with large caps that have prominent scales. Smith described a paler form with a solid stipe from the Sierra Nevada as forma wilsonii. American mycologist R. H. Petersen described an olive-capped form that is otherwise identical to the typical form. These forms are not recognised as distinct.|$|E
25|$|Etruscan {{literacy}} {{was widespread}} over the Mediterranean shores, {{as evidenced by}} about 13,000 inscriptions (dedications, epitaphs, etc.), most fairly short, but <b>some</b> of <b>considerable</b> length. They date from about 700 BC.|$|R
50|$|Most species live in {{semi-arid}} to humid, steppe, savannah and forested environments. Hyperarid deserts are avoided. <b>Some</b> reach <b>considerable</b> topographic altitudes as e.g. in the Atlas Mountains, the Zagros Mountains {{or at the}} Hindukush.|$|R
50|$|Masonry is {{the craft}} of shaping rough pieces of rock into {{accurate}} geometrical shapes, at times simple, but <b>some</b> of <b>considerable</b> complexity, and then arranging the resulting stones, often together with mortar, to form structures.|$|R
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{concentrated}} flavours and high tannin content, many premium Syrah wines {{are at their}} best after <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> bottle aging. In exceptional cases, this may be 15 years or longer.|$|E
25|$|The W {{station was}} located <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> {{distance}} from the area near street level, and this later led to persistent complaints as it required passengers to climb a steep and lengthy gradient to reach the exit.|$|E
25|$|The Auckland Harbour Crossing Swim {{from the}} North Shore to the Viaduct Basin, Auckland CBD, is a yearly summer event, {{covering}} 2.8km (often with <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> counter-currents) and attended by {{over a thousand}} mostly amateur competitors. It is New Zealand's largest ocean swim.|$|E
5000|$|Contributing {{the essay}} on himself for The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Clute wrote that his [...] "criticism, despite some curiously {{flamboyant}} obscurities, remains essentially practical; it has appeared {{mostly in the}} form of reviews, <b>some</b> of <b>considerable</b> length." [...] He told an interviewer, ...|$|R
50|$|British {{overseas}} territories are vested {{with varying degrees}} of power; <b>some</b> enjoy <b>considerable</b> independence from the United Kingdom, which only takes care of their foreign relations and defence. However, they are neither considered {{to be part of the}} United Kingdom, nor recognised as sovereign or associated states.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a growing}} revival of {{interest}} in Yiddish culture among secular Israelis, with the flourishing of new proactive cultural organizations like YUNG YiDiSH, as well as Yiddish theater (usually with simultaneous translation to Hebrew and Russian) and young people are taking university courses in Yiddish, <b>some</b> achieving <b>considerable</b> fluency.|$|R
25|$|Work progressed on the VGN {{throughout}} 1907 and 1908 using construction techniques {{not available}} when the larger railroads {{had been built}} about 25 years earlier. By paying for work with Henry Rogers' personal fortune, the railway was built with no public debt. This feat, a key feature of the successful secrecy in securing the route, was not accomplished without <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> burden to Rogers.|$|E
25|$|My Lord, The {{very great}} {{deficiency}} {{of men in}} the regiments of infantry being so very detrimental to the public service, the king has thought proper to give the names of the different counties to the old corps, in hopes that, by the zeal and activity of the principal nobility and gentry in the several counties, <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> assistance may be given towards recruiting these regiments".|$|E
25|$|There was, in fact, <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> {{debate over}} the {{legitimacy}} of the indictments brought against him by Walker and Prynne. Both had lost considerable amounts of money and property in the fall of Bristol and both were politically opposed to Fiennes and his family. Many of the witnesses at the trial could possibly have been politically motivated and there is even some evidence that Fiennes was actually the victim of a wider political campaign against his family's political faction.|$|E

50|$|Scott Cossu is a new-age pianist. He {{released}} {{a large number}} of albums on Windham Hill between 1980 and 1992, <b>some</b> to <b>considerable</b> sales success: 1987's She Describes Infinity reached #24 on the U.S. Billboard Top Contemporary Jazz Albums chart, and 1989's Switchback reached #12 on the Top New Age Albums chart.|$|R
50|$|Of the 702 {{species in}} 14 genera, <b>some</b> are of <b>considerable</b> {{economic}} importance as vectors of diseases caused by bacteria such as Rickettsia and Borrelia.|$|R
25|$|In 1880 Alice Pit was sunk {{near the}} main line of what was now the North British Railway (formerly the EP). For <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> time the pit was not used, but {{it was decided to}} extend the waggonway across Moss Morran from William Pit to Alice Pit and then round to George Pit. Moss Morran was a {{difficult}} bog, and large quantities of brushwood were dropped into it to stabilise it. The extension was complete by 1895: the Fordell Railway was now 5.75 miles in extent.|$|E
25|$|The Armstrong map of 1775 show a 'Laigh' {{in fairly}} close {{proximity}} to the 'Chapel'. This is in all probability Laigh Chapelton, suggesting that a dwelling existed at this date and adding strength to the supposition that Laigh Chapelton was a building, or the site of a building, of <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> antiquity. A legal document, 'Defences for James Wilson of High Chapelton sued by John Miller of Laigh Chapelton' in 1820 gives us the names of the tenants of both of these properties at this time The rental valuie circa 1820 was Â£180.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{difficulty}} over the correct {{name of the}} capital. Early despatches contain reference to both Port Stanley and Stanley. Port Stanley was accepted by the Naming Commission set up in 1943 to consider the names then being included on the War Office maps. Local opinion differs on the matter, {{but there is no}} doubt that Stanley is now common usage and has been for <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> time. The capital is defined as Stanley in the Interpretation and General Law Ordinance. In the circumstances I would advise that the correct name for the capital is Stanley.|$|E
6000|$|... 4. Now, let {{a partial}} {{sterility}} of the hybrids of <b>some</b> [...] <b>considerable</b> proportion {{of these two}} forms arise; and, as this [...] would probably be due to some special conditions of life, we may [...] fairly suppose it to arise in some definite portion of the area [...] occupied by the two forms.|$|R
50|$|Foster mainly {{targeted}} {{low-income people}} in small, close-knit, communities, {{many of which}} were in the valleys of South Wales. Most investors lost relatively small sums, but <b>some</b> lost <b>considerable</b> amounts, including one investor (who chose not to be identified) who lost Â£180,000, which he had raised by mortgaging his house and borrowing on his credit cards.|$|R
50|$|His duties at St. Mark's clearly {{included}} composition, for {{he wrote}} {{a great deal of}} music for ceremonial affairs, <b>some</b> of <b>considerable</b> historical interest. He provided the music for the festivities accompanying the celebration of the victory over the Turks in the Battle of Lepanto (1571); he also composed music for the visit of several princes from Japan (1585).|$|R
25|$|However, {{development}} was slowed between 1975 and 1977 after {{the introduction of}} the 9K33 Osa missile system, which seemed to fill the same requirement but with greater missile performance. After <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> debate, it was felt that a purely missile-based system would not be as effective at dealing with very low flying attack helicopters attacking at short range with no warning as had been proven so successful in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. Since the reaction time of a gun system is around 8â10 seconds, compared to approximately 30 seconds for a missile-based system, {{development was}} restarted.|$|E
25|$|Few {{data are}} {{available}} that show exactly how deep plesiosaurs dived. That they dived to <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> depth is proven by traces of decompression sickness. The heads of the humeri and femora with many fossils show necrosis of the bone tissue, caused by a too rapid ascent after deep diving. However, this does not allow to deduce some exact depth as the damage could {{have been caused by}} a few very deep dives, or alternatively by a great number of relatively shallow descents. The vertebrae show no such damage: they were probably protected by a superior blood supply, made possible by the arteries entering the bone through the two foramina subcentralia, large openings in their undersides.|$|E
25|$|At {{another part}} of the mine, on Pen-lan-wen, water would have been in short supply; a siphon could have {{transferred}} water from the main aqueduct or one of its tanks, but remains unproven. The vein carries along the hill for <b>some</b> <b>considerable</b> distance, and has been trenched out. This method involved excavating the vein vertically down while keeping the top open. However, ventilation becomes a problem when fire-setting is used, so three long adits were driven in from the hillside to the north. They are much wider than normal galleries, suggesting that their primary purpose was to allow circulation of air through the trench and permit safe fire-setting. The upper two adits are still open to the trench, but the lowest one is currently blocked.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Although most {{patients}} with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) adjust well, <b>some</b> have <b>considerable</b> psychological distress. Factors associated with psychological adjustment in ICD-recipients {{are still not}} well understood. Our purpose was to describe quality-of-life (QoL) and prevalence of self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression in a large national cohort of ICD-recipients, and to determine socio-demographic, clinical, and ICD-related factors associated with these variables...|$|R

50|$|The first Commonwealth Gazette dated 1 January 1901 was {{published}} on 2 January 1901, and contained the Queen's proclamation dated 17 September 1900, {{for the establishment}} of the Commonwealth, the announcement of the appointment of Ministers and their respective offices, and of the appointment of the Governor General and his staff. The appearance of the Gazette was reported by newspapers in every State, <b>some</b> in <b>considerable</b> detail.|$|R
