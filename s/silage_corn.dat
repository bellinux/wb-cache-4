Feeding <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> allows cattle feeders {{to take advantage}} of the entire corn plant at a time of maximum quality and tonnage as well as secure substantial quantities of roughage and grain inventory. Distiller’s grains have proven to be economical and are now a commonplace ingredient in feedlot finishing diets. Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of feeding increased concentrations of <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> in replacement of corn grain in finishing diets containing distillers grains. Feedlot gains and gain:feed ratios were reduced as <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> increased in the diet. Total tract dry matter digestibility of diets containing 45 % <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> was decreased compared to diets containing 15 % <b>corn</b> <b>silage.</b> Although total tract neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration was not different across <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> inclusions, in-situ NDF disappearance of corn bran was greater for diets with increased <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> inclusion. Whole <b>corn</b> plants were sampled and analyzed for two consecutive years for determination of the effects on whole corn plant yield and quality measurements due to hybrid season length, planting density, and whole plant harvest timing. As whole plants were harvested later in the season, yield increased with minimal changes in whole plant quality measures. The economic factors involved in pricing <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> were assessed, and different economic scenarios were developed for feeding <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> in finishing diets containing distillers grains. Feeding increased concentrations of <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> in finishing diets containing distillers grains was determined economical when corn grain price was above $ 163. 38 per metric tonne.

Over a period of five months, two groups of cows in milk were fed a TMR which differed only in the chop length of the <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> (short <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> = 5 mm, long <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> = 21 mm). 30 cows were fed the short and 29 cows were fed the long <b>corn</b> <b>silage.</b> The data on fertility and the overall health of the cows was taken from the herd management program. Milk yield, feed intake and body weight were measured daily; milk composition was measured every two weeks. Twice a week chewing activity was determined. During the first four weeks blood, urine and rumen fluid samples were taken once a week. After the first four weeks, the samples were taken every four weeks until the 20 th week. Feed intake, milk yield and fertility showed {{no significant differences between the}} two feeding groups. The laboratory evaluations showed significant differences between the groups in several values. The group fed the short <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> showed a more acidotic metabolic status than the group fed the long <b>corn</b> <b>silage.</b> Both groups lay within the reference value.

Finally, a comparison of in vitro (artificial rumen) and summative equation digestibility coefficients would indicate the possibility of using the latter for estimating nutritive value in forage crop experimental work. In addition, grass and legume samples, varying widely in nutritive value, were subjected to detergent analysis to ascertain the systems capabilities for assessing differences in chemical composition between forage types. Statistical analysis of the data for chemical composition of the <b>silage</b> <b>corn</b> varieties showed that no significant differences among varieties existed at the five percent probability level. Biological availability of the nutrients of the <b>silage</b> <b>corn</b> varieties was measured by the in vitro (artificial rumen) technique. No significant differences were noted in the 24 -hour trials. However, in the 12 -hour trials varieties two and four gave coefficients that were significantly (P <. 05) greater than varieties one, five, six, seven, or ten. Calculated correlations of the 12 and 24 -hour in vitro (artificial rumen) dry matter digestibility and of coefficients estimated by the summative equation were not highly significant. Relationships of chemical constituent data of grass and legume samples from detergent analysis provided evidence that this feed-stuff fractionation accurately reflects differences in chemical composition between species. Hemicellulose values of the grass were four times as great as those of the alfalfa, but the cellulose content was similar for the two forage types. Comparison of <b>silage</b> <b>corn</b> data with that of the alfalfa gave a relationship analogous to that of the alfalfa-grass.

40|$|A {{finishing}} experiment {{evaluated the}} effects of harvesting drier <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> on performance. Factors were <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> DM (37 or 43 %) and inclusion in the finishing diet (15 or 45 %). As <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> inclusion increased, DMI did not diff er, ADG decreased, and F:G increased. As DM of <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> was increased, no differences in DMI, ADG, or F:G were observed at either 15 or 45 % inclusion. Ensiling drier silage increased tonnage with no negative impact on performance...|$|R
40|$|Four, {{lactating}} {{dairy cows}} {{were randomly assigned}} according to a 2 x 2 Factorial arrangement in a 4 x 4 Latin square design to study supplementation of concentrate containing different level of protein at 14 and 18 % CP and urea-treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> at 2 and 5 % respectively. The treatments were as follows by concentrate containing protein at 14 % CP + 2 % urea-treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> (T 1); concentrate containing protein at 14 % CP + 5 % urea-treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> (T 2); concentrate containing protein at 18 % CP + 2 % urea-treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> (T 3) and concentrate containing protein at 18 % CP + 5 % urea-treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> (T 4), respectively. The animals were offered the treatment concentrate at a ratio to milk yields at 1 : 2 and urea-treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> were fed ad libitum. The results have revealed that total DM intake (%BW) and ruminal pH were not affected (p> 0. 05). Likewise, the concentration of ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N) and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) were significantly different affected by protein levels in concentrate with urea levels treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage.</b> In addition, rumen microorganism populations such as bacteria, protozoa and fungal zoospores were affected (p< 0. 05) by different by protein levels in concentrate with urea level treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage.</b> Moreover, the differences of protein levels in concentrate and urea level treated in <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> were affected to milk yield and composition (p< 0. 05), especially income over feed highest in dairy cows were received a concentrate containing protein at 18 % CP + 5 % urea treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> (T 4). Therefore, results from this experiment indicated that the differences of protein levels in concentrate and urea level treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> affected on rumen ecology and milk production in lactating dairy cows...|$|R
40|$|Three corn hybrids {{harvested}} as whole-plant silage {{were evaluated}} in three separate feeding trials with lactating dairy cows. In trial 1, 24 multiparous Holstein cows {{were used in}} a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square with 28 d periods. Treatments were conventional (Pioneer 3563) and leafy (Mycogen TMF 106) <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> hybrids, each planted at low (59, 000 plants/ha) and high (79, 000 plants/ha) plant populations. There were no milk production differences between treatments. Total-tract digestibility of dietary starch was higher for leafy compared with conventional corn hybrids. In trial 2, 26 multiparous Holstein cows were assigned randomly to diets containing either conventional (48 % forage diet) or brownmidrib (60 % forage diet) <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> in a crossover design with 8 -wk periods. Milk yield was lower, but milk fat percentage and yield were higher, for the high-forage diet containing brown-midrib <b>corn</b> <b>silage.</b> In trial 3, 24 multiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square with 28 -d periods. Treatments were <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> at two concentrations of neutral detergent fiber (Garst 8751, 39. 2 % NDF; Cargill 3677, 32. 8 % NDF) each fed in normal- (53 % of dry matter) and high- (61 to 67 % of dry matter) forage diets. Milk production was not different between corn hybrids. Increased concentrate supplementation increased DMI and milk production. There were minimal benefits to the feeding of leafy or low-fiber <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> hybrids. Feeding brown-midrib <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> in a high-forage diet increased milk fat percentage and yield compared with conventional <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> fed in a normal-forage diet.
