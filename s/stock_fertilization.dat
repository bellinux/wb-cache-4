40|$|The {{synthetic}} estrogen, ethynylestradiol (EE 2), {{has been}} identified in many aquatic environments. EE 2 induces biochemical and physiological effects in exposed fish, but linkages to widespread reproductive dysfunction in populations have not been established. Mortality in early life stages has only been documented at relatively high concentrations, above {{those found in the}} environment. To examine the potential effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of EE 2, reproductive endpoints were examined in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) captured from a lake experimentally treated with ~ 5 ng/L EE 2. Monitoring began two years prior to EE 2 additions in the lake and for 3 years of additions. A nearby lake in which no EE 2 was added was used as a reference. Eggs from fish in each lake were fertilised with milt from the same fish <b>stocks.</b> <b>Fertilization</b> and hatch, mortality, deformities, and size of the fry at swim up were not negatively affected by EE 2 exposure. While our earlier studies have reported impaired reproductive success in small-bodied fish exposed to EE 2 in the same system, lake trout appear to be less affected at the biochemical level and no impacts were determined in other reproductive and population level impacts...|$|R

40|$|A bioenergetic growth {{model was}} {{developed}} to examine the integrated effects of <b>fertilization,</b> <b>stocking</b> density, and spawning on the growth of tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (L.), in pond aquaculture. The analyses showed that growth rates increase {{with higher levels of}} organic fertilization up to 500 kg/ha/week. Growth rates increased with added food rations in ponds, reaching a maximum growth of 2 - 07 g/day at about 44 – 48 days after stocking. Fish growth rates decreased with increased levels of stocking density. The stocking density for optimal growth is 1 fish/m 2; the optimal density for total harvesting weight and fish size is 2 fish/m 2. Model sensitivity analysis indicated that tilapia growth is most sensitive to catabolism (metabolism) and anabolism (synthesis) coefficients, both of which are geometrically related to the fish body weight. Food assimilation efficiency (b) and the food consumption coefficient (h) have a modest effect on fish growth. Spawning in grow-out ponds can have a major effect on fish growth...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} models {{are widely used}} to study soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. Here, we used the CENTURY model to {{simulate}} SOC in wheat-corn cropping systems at three long-term fertilization trials. Our study indicates that CENTURY can simulate fertilization effects on SOC dynamics under different climate and soil conditions. The normalized {{root mean square error}} is less than 15 % for all the treatments. Soil carbon presents various changes under different fertilization management. Treatment with straw return would enhance SOC to a relatively stable level whereas chemical fertilization affects SOC differently across the three sites. After running CENTURY over the period of 1990 - 2050, the SOC levels are predicted to increase from 31. 8 to 52. 1 Mg ha- 1 across the three sites. We estimate that the carbon sequestration potential between 1990 and 2050 would be 9. 4 - 35. 7 Mg ha- 1 under the current high manure application at the three sites. Analysis of SOC in each carbon pool indicates that long-term fertilization enhances the slow pool proportion but decreases the passive pool proportion. Model results suggest that change in the slow carbon pool is the major driver of the overall trends in SOC <b>stocks</b> under long-term <b>fertilization...</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} {{on the effects of}} land use change on soil Carbon stocks in Colombian Amazonia. Such information would be needed {{to assess the impact of}} this area on the global C cycle and the sustainability of agricultural systems that are replacing native forest. The aim of this study was to evaluate soil carbon stocks and changes after the clearing of the native forest, the establishment of pastures and the reclamation of the degraded pasture, in Caquetá, Colombia. We compared the contents of Total C, Oxidizable C and Non-Oxidizable (stable) C in four different land use systems, namely Monoculture (Brachiaria grassland), Association (Brachiaria + Arachis pintoi), Forage Bank (a mixture of forage tree species), and Natural Regeneration of the pasture in both a flat area and a sloping one. The Degraded Pasture was the reference. Results showed that in the sloping area all treatments have higher Total Carbon stocks than the Degraded Pasture, while three of the treatments significantly increased the stocks of Non-Oxidizable C. In the flat landscape, only the Association significantly increased Total C <b>stocks.</b> Plowing and <b>fertilization</b> cause significant increases in Oxidizable carbon and decreases in Non-Oxidizable carbon. This effect needs further research, as C stability will influence equilibrium stocks. In the sloping area, improved pastures and fodder bank rapidly increased Total Carbon contents and stocks, with increases as large as 10 ton. ha- 1 yr- 1. In the Traditional Fodder Bank, which showed the largest increase, this is partially due to the application of organic manure. Surprisingly, also C stocks under Natural Regeneration were significantly higher than under the original Degraded Grassland. This increase was fully due to Non-Oxidizable Carbon, which is difficult to explain. Stable isotope analysis indicated that under improved grassland, especially Brachiaria monoculture, up to 40 % of the original C in the upper 10 cm was replaced in 3. 3 years...|$|R
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{efficiency in}} the grandparent stock and the parent stock of geese was monitored in the thesis. In {{terms of the}} grandparent stock, there were found out better values in year 2012 than in year 2013. In 2012, there was a better egg fertilization of 4. 61 % (the average was 49. 65 %) and hatchability of the put eggs better of 3. 83 % (the average was 39. 01 %). The hatchability of the fertilized eggs was almost the same in both years. It has the same value of 78. 63 %. Best results were proved in strains 1, 3 and 4. Worst values were proved in the strain number 41. The chosen indicators of geese of four ponds were monitored in the parent <b>stock.</b> The average <b>fertilization</b> of eggs was 58. 26 %; significantly higher value was proved in case of the Jakulský pond (72. 34 %). The average hatchability of the put eggs reached 46. 46 %; the highest value was also proved on the Jakulský pond (56. 22 %). The other ponds have balanced results. The hatchability of the fertilized eggs reached the average value of 79. 10 %, the highest value was proved on the Lomský pond (84. 45 %); the second place {{is represented by the}} Velebil pond (79. 42 %). The geese bred on the Lomský pond had eggs with the lowest fertilization, but with the highest percent of hatchability of the fertilized eggs. In case of geese bred on the Velebil pond, there was an increase of the monitored indicators in year 2013 than in 2012. In contrast, the Byňovský pond, the Jakulský pond and the Lomský pond showed an increase of the monitored indicators in 2012. There was a smaller difference of egg fertilization in geese of the Jakulský and the Lomský pond. There was a smaller difference of hatchability indicators of either put or fertilized eggs in geese bred on the Byňovský and the Jakulský pond...|$|R

Foram testadas as cargas de 3, 3 (leve) e 10 cab/ha (pesada), com (5 t/ha de esterco de caprinos) e sem adubação orgânica. Utilizou-se um delineamento inteiramente casualizado distribuído em um fatorial 2 x 2 x 3 (carga animal x adubação x ano), com duas repetições.

The stocking rates were 3. 3 (light) and 10. 0 heads/ha (heavy), with (5. 0 ton/ha of goat manure) and without fertilization. A complete randomized design was followed, with a factorial distribution of 2 x 2 x 3 (<b>stocking</b> rate x <b>fertilization</b> x year), with two repetitions. Sheep grazing resulted in total disapearing of the grass species and an increasing of the forbs, along the period of study. The organic fertilization did not show significant effects (P> 0. 05) on the animal and pasture performances. The best animal performance (P< 0. 01) was observed on the padocks under light stocking rate (3. 3 head/ha), with 108. 0 g/head/day, and the best performance (P< 0. 01) of the pasture was obtained on the areas under heavy stocking rate (10 head/ha), with 71. 2 kg/ha/year. Although, the short duration grazing with sheep presented high performance by the animals and by the pasture, it should not be recommended for the thinned caatinga, because it unbalances the herbaceous layer composition, the principal source of the diet of those ruminants. Possibly, the alternate grazing with other herbivorous of different grazing habit and diet composition may result on a beter sustainability of the exploration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. Tilapia culture {{contributes}} {{greatly to}} world aquaculture production. Several tilapia strains {{have been developed}} locally and one of these has been developed for brackishwater aquaculture. BEST or the Brackishwater Enhanced Selected Tilapia {{was developed by the}} Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources with the aim of promoting brackishwater culture of this commodity to further improve tilapia production in the Philippines. This study will determine the growth performance of BEST reared in organically fertilized brackishwater ponds at three different stocking densities. The study was conducted in nine (9) units of 200 m 2 ponds. Pond preparation was done following standard procedures that include drying, liming, teaseed application and <b>fertilization.</b> <b>Stocking</b> was done after twenty days when primary productivity in the ponds was noted. Three culture systems were used, namely: extensive (Treatment 1 or T 1), semiintensive (Treatment 2 or T 2) and intensive (Treatment 3 or T 3) systems. The study was conducted for 120 days. Results showed that fish in ponds in treatment T 1 had an average body weight (ABW) of 52. 1 g, T 2 stocks with ABW of 223. 1 g and T 3 stocks with an ABW of 214. 5 g. Meanwhile, T 1 stocks had a survival rate of 91. 9 % while stocks under T 2 and T 3 had survival rates of 80 % and 84 % respectively. T 1 results showed losses amounting to P 382 since total revenue of P 958 is smaller than total cost of P 1, 340. T 2 harvest on the other hand registered a total revenue of P 10, 368 and total cost of P 4, 375 hence net return of P 5, 634. T 3 also had total revenue of P 21, 419 with a total cost of over P 8, 498 giving a net return of P 12, 471. T 2 showed a return on investment (ROI) of 128 % and a payback period of 0. 77 year.

40|$|On-farm {{emissions}} from animals and manure {{must be taken}} into account when the GHG mitigation potential of grassland management strategies involving grazing are evaluated. Greenhouse gas (GHG) {{emissions from}} manure management include direct emissions of CH 4 and N 2 O, as well as indirect emissions of N 2 O derived from NH 3 /NOx. Quantification of GHG emissions from manure are typically based on national statistics for manure production and housing systems combined with emission factors which have been defined by the IPCC or nationally. The quality of GHG inventories for manure management is critically dependent on the applicability of these emission factors. Animal manure is collected as solid manure + urine, as liquid manure (slurry) or as deep litter, or it is deposited outside in drylots or on pastures. These manure categories represent very different potentials for GHG emissions, as also reflected in the methane conversion factors and nitrous oxide emission factors, respectively. However, even within each category the variations in manure composition and storage conditions can lead to highly variable emissions in practice. This variability is a major source of error in the quantification of the GHG balance for a system. To the extent that such variability is influenced by management and/or local climatic conditions, it may be possible to improve the procedures for estimating CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from manure. Manure (dung and urine) deposited during grazing influences fluxes of both CH 4, N 2 O and NH 3 from the pasture. In particular, urine patches are important point sources of NH 3 and N 2 O, whereas the N input may locally reduce CH 4 oxidation activity. Ammonia losses from pastures are not specifically represented in the IPCC methodology, which calculates NH 3 volatilization as a fixed proportion of total N excreted. However, ammonia losses from excretal returns to the pasture increase with N surplus in the diet since this N is mainly excreted as urea in the urine. Also, several methodologies exist for mitigating NH 3 losses from storage facilities. Hence, both optimized feeding and restricted access to grazing with collection of manure on the farm are available as NH 3 mitigation options, though not identified by the IPCC methodology. Technical solutions to reduce NH 3 volatilization from storages may reduce (slurry) or increase (solid manure) CH 4 emissions, an aspect that must also be taken into account. The N 2 O emission factor for N deposited on pastures is higher than for N in manure collected during housing, indicating that restricted access to grazing is also a N 2 O mitigation option. Several studies have suggested that N 2 O emissions from excreta deposited during grazing interact with factors like feed composition, <b>stock</b> density, N <b>fertilization,</b> soil compaction and climate. However, there is presently little evidence to suggest that emissions of N 2 O can be consistently changed via management practices. ...|$|R
