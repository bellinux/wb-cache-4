5|$|In 2006, PETA {{went before}} Burger King's board of {{directors}} during its parent company's annual corporate meeting to request that poultry <b>suppliers</b> switched to a more-humane method of slaughter called controlled atmosphere killing (CAK). Instead of using its previous tactic of stating that the procedure is more humane, {{the group claimed that}} CAK was economically more feasible as it reduces the chances of injury to workers in poultry factories and it produces better products by preventing injury to the animal. Responding to the proposal in March 2007, Burger King announced it would make further changes to its animal-welfare policies. The new policies favor <b>suppliers</b> of chickens that utilize CAK rather than electric shock to knock birds unconscious before slaughter, and require its pork and poultry <b>suppliers</b> to upgrade the living conditions of pigs and chickens. Under the agreement, 2% of BK's North American egg <b>suppliers</b> are to use cage-free-produced eggs and 10% of pork <b>suppliers</b> are to use crate-free pigs for its pork products. PETA and the Humane Society of the United States were quoted as saying that Burger King’s initiatives put it ahead of its competitors in terms of animal rights and welfare and that they were hopeful that the new initiatives would trigger reform throughout the fast food industry as a whole.|$|E

In a concession to these groups, BK agreed to adopt a series of policies for its <b>suppliers</b> for several of its raw animal products. The company has established a preference for purchasing eggs and pork-based products from those <b>suppliers</b> that use cage-free production methods.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the outcomes of}} <b>supplier</b> development as perceived by the <b>supplier.</b> More specifically, we investigate whether <b>supplier</b> adaptation {{occurs as a result}} of the interplay among <b>supplier</b> development, preferential buyer status and <b>supplier</b> relational embeddedness. <b>Supplier</b> relational embeddedness provides information to the buyer about the <b>supplier’s</b> intentions to reciprocate and stay close with the buyer. We examine the linkages between supply chain management research on <b>supplier</b> development, organization theory research on adaptation, social capital and networks in order to investigate how buyers can influence their competitive position in a <b>supplier’s</b> portfolio of competitive buyers. Furthermore, we introduce into our conceptual model a number of relational mediators (i. e. trust, commitment and satisfaction) advancing existent research on <b>supplier</b> development and adaptation. The results show that the relationship between <b>supplier</b> relational embeddedness and a buyer’s investments in <b>supplier</b> development are partially mediated by <b>supplier</b> trust, satisfaction (economic) and commitment (affective). <b>Supplier</b> relational embeddedness is an important mediator between investments in <b>supplier</b> development and gaining preferential buyer status that eventually effects in <b>supplier</b> adaptation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} modularity, architectural knowledge and joint measurability on joint <b>supplier</b> performance in multisourcing settings. In particular, we examine these relationships by assuming a moderating role for the guardian <b>supplier.</b> The limited, though growing, IS literature on multisourcing has hinted at the central role that the guardian <b>supplier</b> is assuming as a mediating sourcing model between the client firm and the <b>supplier</b> network. However, {{little is known about}} the effect of the guardian <b>supplier</b> on the factors that may improve joint <b>supplier</b> performance. A study of 190 client firms suggests that in the non-guardian <b>supplier</b> model (i. e. the client firm governs the <b>supplier</b> network), modularity, architectural knowledge and joint measurability positively affect joint <b>supplier</b> performance. In the case of a guardian <b>supplier</b> model, modularity and architectural knowledge no longer affect joint <b>supplier</b> performance; however, joint measurability still remains important for joint <b>supplier</b> performance. Our results hint at the importance of certain capabilities that the client firm needs to possess in order to improve joint <b>supplier</b> performance subject to its choice of a guardian <b>supplier...</b>|$|R

40|$|In recent years, many {{companies}} {{have come to}} recognize the crucial role that purchasing and materials management activities play in determining overall corporate performance. Of main concern in {{many companies}} is the <b>supplier</b> development program. To examine the role of <b>supplier</b> development {{in the context of}} buyer-supplier performance from a buying firm's perspective, a survey was conducted of 142 electronic manufacturing companies in Hong Kong. Factor analysis yielded eight factors including transaction-specific <b>supplier</b> development and seven infrastructure factors of <b>supplier</b> development: strategic goals, effective communications, long-term commitment, top management support, <b>supplier</b> evaluation, <b>supplier</b> strategic objectives, and buyer trust in the <b>supplier.</b> Correlation analysis indicated that transaction-specific <b>supplier</b> development and its infrastructure factors significantly correlated with the perceived buyer-supplier performance outcomes.

40|$|Background: The {{assessment}} of <b>supplier</b> performance {{is an important}} activity for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) as they adopt and implement plans and policies aimed at enhancing their performance {{in order to achieve}} sustainable competitive advantages. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the influence of information sharing, <b>supplier</b> trust and <b>supplier</b> synergy on <b>supplier</b> performance in SMEs. Method: A quantitative research design was adopted in which a survey questionnaire was administered to a sample of 309 owners and managers of SMEs based in southern Gauteng, South Africa. A confirmatory factor analysis was undertaken to assess the properties of the measurement scale. Hypotheses were tested using the path modelling technique. Results: Information sharing exerted a moderate positive and significant influence on <b>supplier</b> trust and a weak but sigificant influence on <b>supplier</b> synergy. <b>Supplier</b> synergy had a strong positive and significant influence on <b>supplier</b> performance. However, the influence of <b>supplier</b> trust on <b>supplier</b> performance was weak and insignificant. Conclusion: The study provides a useful framework for analysing the interplay between information sharing, <b>supplier</b> trust, <b>supplier</b> synergy and <b>supplier</b> performance in SMEs. </p...|$|R

No exception in manufacture sector, attempt to be creative and innovative are {{needed in order to}} survive. Those efforts are happened if the production processes run smoothly and supported by the <b>supplier’s</b> good performance as raw material <b>supplier</b> for production process. CV. Primasindo Jaya Abadi is semi manufactures company that located in Surabaya that produce finger joint wood and laminating services. Raw material <b>supplier</b> is critical factor for the company. If the <b>supplier</b> have a bad performance, its impact the production process badly. Until today, CV.

The results from a LISREL analysis of 142 international business relationships show that the <b>supplier's</b> bridgehead relationships are conditioned by the personal relations with the foreign customer. The <b>supplier's</b> bridgehead relationships are also dependent on mutual commercial dependence between the <b>supplier</b> and the foreign customer. The results show that the <b>supplier</b> views the foreign customer as a conduit for foreign market development and will commit itself to the business relationship for this reason. A further finding is that the network of business relations connected with a <b>supplier</b> and its foreign customer constitutes an important setting for the <b>supplier's</b> bridgehead relationships.

40|$|Recent {{operations}} management and innovation management research {{emphasizes the importance}} of <b>supplier</b> integration. However, the empirical results as to the relationship between <b>supplier</b> integration and time-to-market are ambivalent. To understand this important relationship, we incorporate two major recent developments. First, the literature has started to redefine <b>supplier</b> integration into two dimensions, <b>supplier</b> product integration and <b>supplier</b> process integration. Second, recent research has begun to examine spillover effects that extend beyond the direct costs and benefits of the <b>supplier</b> contract. Using survey data of 116 firms in the industrials, health care, and information technology industries, the results confirm our hypotheses and show that <b>supplier</b> product integration decelerates time-to-market while <b>supplier</b> process integration accelerates time-to-market. The results also show a positive relationship between <b>supplier</b> integration and the adoption of external technologies, which either decelerates or accelerates time-to-market depending on the level of internal exploration activities. Our research, thus, helps to open the ‘black-box’ of the relationship between <b>supplier</b> integration and time-to-market, and provides a theoretically grounded explanation to the apparent contradictory results in prior research about the influence of <b>supplier</b> integration on time-to-market. In addition, we contribute to research on spillover effects by emphasizing that information technology adoption and assimilation is an important spillover effect of <b>supplier</b> integration...|$|R
