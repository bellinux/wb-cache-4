5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the <b>state</b> <b>would</b> manage the businesses. With the money generated, the <b>state</b> <b>would</b> then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the <b>state</b> <b>would</b> need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. The <b>state</b> <b>would</b> not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the <b>state</b> <b>would</b> just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the common good of society.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} on 29 November, the United Nations General Assembly decided to end the British Mandate on 1August1948. Palestine would be {{partitioned}} into separate Arab and Jewish states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. The Jewish <b>state</b> <b>would</b> have fifty-six per cent of the land {{with a population of}} 490,000Jews and 325,000Arabs, while the Arab <b>state</b> <b>would</b> have 807,000Arabs, but only 10,000Jews. The population of Jerusalem would be around 105,000Arabs to 100,000Jews.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Wetherby resumed his private law practice. In 1956, Senator Alben Barkley {{unexpectedly}} {{died of a}} heart attack. The timing of his death meant that the <b>state</b> <b>would</b> elect two senators in 1956—Clements' term was expiring and now Barkley's seat was vacant. President Eisenhower convinced former senator and ambassador John Sherman Cooper to be the Republican candidate for the seat, hoping Cooper's immense popularity in the <b>state</b> <b>would</b> help his own re-election bid. Barkley's death occurred so late in the year that there was not time for a Democratic primary to choose the party's candidate for the open seat. The Democratic state committee chose Wetherby, who was only six months removed from his term as governor.|$|E

5|$|After {{the rebel}} capture of Brussels on 18 December, work soon began {{on a new}} constitution. In January, the rebels re-called the States-General, a {{traditional}} assembly composed of the provincial elites which had not met since the Middle Ages, to discuss the form the new <b>state</b> <b>would</b> take. Its 53 members, representing the states and social classes, met in Brussels in January 1790 to begin negotiations. The constitution eventually devised by the States-General was inspired by both the Dutch Verlatinge of 1581 and American Declaration of Independence of 1776. The liberals were disgusted that members of society from beyond the guilds, clergy and nobility should not be consulted. They also saw the closed sessions of the States-General as ridiculing the idea of popular sovereignty. The declaration of the independence was not supported by Britain and the Dutch who believed that the new independent <b>state</b> <b>would</b> {{not be able to}} act as an effective buffer against possible French territorial expansion in the region.|$|E
5|$|Archie Clement led {{the guerrillas}} after Anderson's death, {{but the group}} {{splintered}} by mid-November. Most Confederate guerrillas lost heart around that time, owing to a cold winter {{and the failure of}} General Price's 1864 Missouri campaign, which ensured that the <b>state</b> <b>would</b> remain under Union control. As the Confederacy collapsed, most of Anderson's men joined Quantrill's forces or traveled to Texas. Jim Anderson moved to Sherman, Texas, with his two sisters.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the 2010 college football season, the annual poll by media members who cover ACC football predicted Florida <b>State</b> <b>would</b> win the Atlantic Division and Virginia Tech would win the Coastal Division. Florida State received 78 of a possible 98 first-place votes in its division, while Virginia Tech received 62. In a vote to predict the ACC champion, Virginia Tech received 50 votes from 98 possible. Florida State received 26 votes, and all other teams received a combined 20.|$|E
5|$|Boston College (ACC: 3–3) {{could travel}} to the ACC Championship Game if they won out by beating both Wake Forest and Maryland. Boston College {{eventually}} did just that, and lost to Virginia Tech in the 2008 ACC Championship Game. Florida State (ACC: 4–3) would have won the Atlantic Division if they beat Maryland, Maryland beat Boston College, and Boston College beat Wake Forest. Under those circumstances, Florida <b>State</b> <b>would</b> have finished with a 5–3record, tied with Maryland. Florida <b>State</b> <b>would</b> win the tiebreaker because they had defeated Maryland head-to-head. As it happened, Maryland lost to Boston College, which relegated Florida State to a second-place finish in the division. Wake Forest (ACC: 4–3) would have won the division if they won their last game against Boston College, and both Florida State and Boston College beat Maryland. In that case, Florida State and Wake Forest would have had identical conference records (ACC: 5–3), and Wake Forest would have won the tiebreaker because they defeated Florida State earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{supporters}} {{sought to}} make him the National Republican nominee for governor in the election of 1828. Though his nomination was all but certain, Crittenden declined the opportunity, fearing that his association with Clay, who was losing popularity in the <b>state,</b> <b>would</b> cost his party the election. Instead, he threw his support behind Thomas Metcalfe, {{who went on to}} carry a very close election over Democrat William T. Barry. Crittenden instead sought another term in the Kentucky House, but was again denied the seat.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that swaraj {{not only can}} be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence. Military is unnecessary, because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While military is unnecessary in a nation organised under swaraj principle, Gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature. However, the <b>state</b> <b>would</b> limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force.|$|E
