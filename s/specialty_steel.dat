It {{is produced in}} China and Russia from steel smelter slag; other countries produce it either from the flue dust of heavy oil, or as a byproduct of uranium mining. It is mainly used to produce <b>specialty</b> <b>steel</b> alloys such as high-speed tool steels.

25|$|Carpenter Steel Company, Inc. was {{incorporated}} on June 7, 1889, and Carpenter became its general manager. He leased the defunct Philadelphia and Reading rail mill in Reading, and eleven weeks {{later he was}} pouring steel for tools. Within a short time, 3,000 tons of steel had been produced and the company was receiving orders that exceeded {{the capacity of the}} mill. In November Carpenter acquired the nearby Union Foundry, which he modernized and expanded. The old Union Foundry is now the headquarters of the Carpenter Technology Corporation and is a <b>specialty</b> <b>steel</b> producer.|$|E
25|$|Carpenter bought {{property}} and built an Italianate house at 606, North Fifth Street, Reading, {{which he called}} Swanona (not Swannanoa). The house is slightly over a mile south of the Carpenter foundry, and Carpenter often walked to work. He became involved in community affairs {{as a member of}} the Grand Army of the Republic and later became a Vice Commander of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, also known as the Union Veteran Legion, in Reading. These organizations gained him business contacts and led him to learn that <b>specialty</b> <b>steel</b> was needed by the U.S. Navy.|$|E

25|$|Smith quickly {{ran into}} trouble with the new Navy contracts. Firstly, his bid of $374,000 per ship for the three destroyers proved too low. Delays in {{delivery}} of <b>specialty</b> <b>steel</b> for the ships meant postponement of Navy payments which were made on a milestone basis. Furthermore, the Navy design proved too ambitious, as the ships' hulls were too light to absorb vibrations caused by the powerful engines. As a result, the USS Bainbridge was subjected to more Navy trials than any other warship, {{and by the time}} the vessels were finally delivered in 1902, Smith had lost a total of $180,000 on the three destroyer contracts.|$|E
2500|$|World War II sparked {{significant}} {{industrial expansion}} in the area: <b>specialty</b> <b>steel,</b> fasteners, custom machining. After the war, two of the Big Three automobile manufacturers (General Motors & Chrysler) had major operations in the area. Syracuse was headquarters for Carrier Corporation, and Crouse-Hinds manufactured traffic signals in Syracuse. [...] General Electric had its main television manufacturing plant at Electronics Parkway in Syracuse.|$|E
2500|$|A rise in {{the demand}} for <b>specialty</b> <b>steel</b> helped offset these losses somewhat, and Union-Miles Park {{remained}} a Central and Eastern European ethnic enclave until the 1960s. This enabled the Catholic presence in the neighborhood to continue to thrive. In 1955, St. Mary's Ukrainian Catholic Church broke ground on its new church home at Kinsman Road and E. 105th Street. That same year, St. Joseph Byzantine Catholic Church began construction on a $400,000 ($ in [...] dollars), eight-room school and parish rectory. The structures were completed in 1957, and the original 1913 church demolished.|$|E

50|$|Puddling was {{one step}} {{in one of}} the most {{important}} processes of making the first appreciable volumes of high-grade bar iron (malleable wrought iron) during the Industrial Revolution. In the original puddling technique, molten iron in a reverberatory furnace was stirred with rods, which were consumed in the process. It was one of the first processes for making bar iron without charcoal in Europe, although much earlier coal-based processes had existed in China. Eventually, the furnace would be used to make small quantities of <b>specialty</b> <b>steels.</b>|$|R

[...] Before machine tools it was prohibitively expensive to make precision parts, an essential requirement for many machines and interchangeable parts.

50|$|Crucible's history spans over 100 years, and {{the company}} {{inherited}} some {{of its ability to}} produce high-grade steel from England beginning in the late 1800s. Thirteen crucible-steel companies merged in 1900 to become the largest producer of crucible steel in the United States, and this company evolved into a corporation with 1,400 employees in several states. Crucible declined in tandem with the automotive industry during the 1980s, recovering over the next decade.

5000|$|After 1890 the Bessemer {{process was}} {{gradually}} supplanted by open-hearth steelmaking {{and by the}} middle of the 20th century was no longer in use.

Its process allowed closer control over the composition of the steel; also, a substantial quantity of scrap could be included in the charge. The crucible process remained important for making high-quality alloy steel into the 20th century. By 1900 the electric arc furnace was adapted to steelmaking and by the 1920s, the falling cost of electricity allowed it to largely supplant the crucible process for <b>specialty</b> <b>steels.</b>|$|R
