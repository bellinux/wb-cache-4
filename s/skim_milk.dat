In this double-blind RCT, 499 primarily breast-fed infants were fed for 6 months with a daily milk-based complementary food that included either whey protein concentrate enriched in MFGM, or {{an equal amount of}} additional protein from <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> (control). Results showed that the group with the MFGM-supplemented diet had a significantly lower prevalence of diarrhea during the study compared to the control group (3.84% vs 4.37%; P<0.05), as well as a significant reduction (46%) in episodes of bloody diarrhea compared to the control group (P=0.025).|$|E

40|$|Among {{commensal}} bacteria, Bifidobacteria {{are one of}} {{the most}} numerous probiotics in the mammalian gut. Two strains of Bifidobacterium (B) were isolated from stool of breastfed infants and identified by their 16 S rRNA genes. The strains were identical to B. longum subsp. longum FA 1 and B. breve M 4 A. These isolates were conserved by lyophilisation, and the survival rates measured six months after lyophilisation, were 74. 74 % and 99. 6 % for B. longum subsp. longum FA 1 and B. breve M 4 A, respectively. To improve the survival rate in <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> media used for lyophilisation, the <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> was supplemented with yeast extract, glucose and oligofructose. Supplementation decreased the doubling time and increased the viable cell count. Statistical analyses showed a nonlinear relationship between <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> media and bacterial count number and acid production, which indicates an opposite impact of yeast extract with glucose or oligofructose supplementation in <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> media. Response surface plots were applied to optimize the supplemented <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> media. Both strains grew more rapidly in supplemented media than in skimmed milk-based medium alone. Acid production was higher in B. breve M 4 A than B. longum subsp. longum FA 1 when inoculated into <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> supplemented with yeast extract, glucose, and oligofructose. The fermentation ability in <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> was dependent on nutrient availability and the carbon source, which decreased the doubling time and increased the viable cell count. The addition of yeast extract, glucose, and oligofructose to <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> increased the growth rate and acid production, compared with <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> alone, when incubated anaerobically at 37 °C for 48 h. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential synergy between Bifidobacterium isolates with yeast extract, glucose, and oligofructose in <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> after 6 months of conservation...|$|R

25|$|Primary {{ingredients}} are blended in large stainless steel tanks and <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> is added and adjusted to 60°C. Then, fats, oils and emulsifiers are added.

Types of pasteurized milk include full cream, reduced fat, <b>skim</b> <b>milk,</b> calcium enriched, flavoured, and UHT. The standard high temperature short time (HTST) process of 72°C for 15 seconds completely kills pathogenic bacteria in milk, rendering it safe to drink for up to three weeks if continually refrigerated.

40|$|Scope]: Metabolomics {{approach}} {{is focused on}} identifying all metabolites present in a biological sample (metabolome). Consumption of cocoa products has been related to health benefits including positive effect on cardiovascular health. [Methods and results]: Twenty volunteers were included in this randomized, crossover, and controlled clinical trial. After a 2 -wk washout period, subjects received 40 g/day of cocoa powder with 500 mL <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> (cocoa with <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> intervention) or 500 mL/day of <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> (<b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> intervention) for 4 -wk. Urine (24 h) samples were collected at baseline and after each intervention and were analyzed by HPLC-hybrid quadrupole TOF in negative and positive ionization modes followed by multivariate analysis. This analysis revealed a marked separation between the cocoa with <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> intervention and <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> intervention and baseline periods. Thirty-nine compounds linked with cocoa intake, including alkaloid metabolites, polyphenol host and gut microbial metabolites (hydroxyphenylvalerolactones and hydroxyphenylvaleric acids), diketopiperazines and N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acids were identified. In the case of endogenous metabolites, putative identifications suggested that metabolites linked with carnitine metabolism and sulfation of tyrosine were decreased by the consumption of cocoa. [Conclusion]: LC-MS metabolomics strategy allows the defining of a complex metabolic profile derived from cocoa phytochemicals. Likewise, the identification of endogenous markers could lead to new hypotheses to unravel the relationship between cocoa intake and cardiovascular diseases. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
