The results show that <b>sinapis</b> <b>alba</b> extract is a good inhibitor, and the inhibition efficiency increases with inhibitor (<b>sinapis</b> <b>alba</b> extract) concentration, and slightly increases with increasing temperature. The inhibition efficiency reaches a maximum value of 97. 98 % with the highest extract concentration at 50 ˚C. In the presence of <b>sinapis</b> <b>alba</b> extract, the results were indicative of slightly decreased aluminum dissolution with increasing temperature. The adsorption of <b>sinapis</b> <b>alba</b> extract on aluminum surface obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm, with high regression coefficient value. The entropy (∆S#) and enthalpy (∆H#) of activation are calculated and discussed. The thermodynamic adsorption free energy (∆Goads) value and sign were indicative of the physisorption of <b>sinapis</b> <b>alba</b> extract molecules on aluminum surface.

This thesis evaluates the influence of paracetamol contained in pharmaceuticals Paralen 500 tbl. and Panadol tbl., and of the paracetamol analytical standard on the environment.

The highest tested concentration of paracetamol was 2341, 67 mg/l.

Hg and Mn threshold values are not established in legislation, but values have been determined for the needs of the landfill operator. For heavy metals Cr, Cu, and Ni sample  2 exceeded the threshold values, which attained the highest values of all the samples tested for Cr, Cu, and Ni. For Cr and Ni the values were several times higher than values of the other samples. The second highest values for Cr, Cu, and Ni showed sample  6 and 7. Both samples exceeded the set limits. An increase in plant biomass was observed in plants growing on plates with soil samples, but no changes in appearance, slow growth, or necrotic lesions appeared.
