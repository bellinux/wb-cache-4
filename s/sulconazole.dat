A recent study (2014) identified several volatile organic compounds (benzaldehyde, benzothiazole, decanal, nonanal, N,N-dimethyloctylamine, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol) that were previously identified from fungistatic soils, which demonstrated inhibition of both mycelial extension and growth from conidia.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of {{free fatty acids}} in liposome model membranes sensitizes these membranes to {{the action of the}} imidazole antifungals, clotrimazole, micronazole, and <b>sulconazole.</b> Unsaturation of the fatty acids is an important variable; the effect of linoleic and oleic acids is much greater than that of stearic acid. The imidazoles differ somewhat in action, with clotrimazole potency greatest both on membranes with and without fatty acids. <b>Sulconazole</b> has very little activity on membranes without fatty acids even at the highest concentrations tested. The data are discussed with reference to the susceptibility of various cells to the imidazoles and the specificity of imidazole action. A modification of the enzymatic method generally used for assay of marker glucose with liposome systems is also presented...|$|E
40|$|After {{clinical}} diagnosis and microscopic confirmation, tinea cruris is best {{treated with a}} topical allylamine or an azole antifungal (strength of recommendation: A, based on multiple randomized controlled trials [RCTs]). Differences in current comparison data are insufficient to stratify the 2 groups of topical antifungals. Determining which group to use depends on patient compliance, medication accessibility, and cost. The fungicidal allylamines (naftifine and terbinafine) and butenafine (allylamine derivative) are a more costly group of topical tinea treatments, yet they are more convenient as they allow for a shorter duration of treatment compared with fungistatic azoles (clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, miconazole, and <b>sulconazole)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Fungal {{infections are}} a major burden {{to the health and}} welfare of modern humans. They range from simply cosmetic, non-life-threatening skin infections to severe, {{systemic}} infections that may lead to significant debilitation or death. The selection of chemotherapeutic agents useful for the treatment of fungal infections is small. In this overview, a major chemical group with antifungal activity, the azole derivatives, is examined. Included are historical and state of the art information on the in vitro activity, experimental in vivo activity, mode of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical studies, and uses and adverse reactions of imidazoles currently marketed (clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole, bifonazole, butoconazole, croconazole, fenticonazole, isoconazole, oxiconazole, <b>sulconazole,</b> and tioconazole) and under development (aliconazole and omoconazole), as well as triazoles currently marketed (terconazole) and under development (fluconazole, itraconazole, vibunazole, alteconazole, and ICI 195, 739) ...|$|E
40|$|The present article {{reviews the}} {{literature}} (up to 1994) on contact sensitivity to imidazoles and {{presents the results}} obtained from 15 patients observed at the Contact Allergy Unit in Leuven. The frequency {{as well as the}} cross-reaction patterns described are analyzed. Although allergic contact reactions may have been missed in the past (mainly because of problems with the correct choice of vehicle for patch testing), they seem to be relatively infrequent in view of their widespread use. The imidazole derivatives most frequently reported to be allergens are miconazole, econazole, tioconazole, and isoconazole. As far as cross-reactivity is concerned, statistically significant associations were found in the patient data between miconazole, econazole, and isoconazole; between <b>sulconazole,</b> miconazole, and econazole; and also between isoconazole and tioconazole. Patients sensitive to phenylethyl imidazoles (except ketoconazole) needing antimycotic therapy should be advised to use ketoconazole, clotrimazole, bifonazole, or, perhaps, the new flutrimazole. Clearly, non-imidazole antifungals can also be used. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The enantioseparation of ten basic drugs was {{evaluated}} in NACE systems using heptakis(2 -O-methyl- 3 -O-acetyl- 6 -O-sulfo) -β-CD (HMAS-β-CD). For this purpose, a D-optimal design with 21 experimental points was applied. Four antifungal agents (econazole, isoconazole, miconazole, <b>sulconazole),</b> three local anesthetics (bupivacaine, mepivacaine and prilocaine), two sympathomimetics (salbutamol and terbutaline) and one β-blocker (carvedilol) were selected as basic model analytes. The {{influence on the}} enantiomeric resolution of anionic CD and BGE anion concentrations {{as well as the}} BGE anion nature was investigated. For all studied analytes, the enantiomeric resolution was shown to be significantly influenced by the CD concentration. Based on the observed results, a generic NACE system was recommended, namely 20 mM HMAS-β-CD and 10 mM ammonium camphorSO 3 - in methanol acidified with 0. 75 M formic acid. Moreover, this NACE system was compared to previous conditions with heptakis(2, 3 -di-O-methyl- 6 -O-sulfo) -β-CD (HDMS-β-CD) or heptakis(2, 3 -di-O-acetyl- 6 -O-sulfo) -β-CD (HDAS-β-CD). Finally, two generic systems using either HDAS-β-CD or HMAS-β-CD were proposed and evaluated for the enantioseparation of ketamine and norketamine after incubation of ketamine in phenobarbital-induced male rat liver microsomes systems.

40|$|Enantioselective {{separation}} of azole compounds by EKC. Reversal of migration order of enantiomers with CD concentration The enantioselective {{separation of}} a group of six weak base azole compounds was achieved in this work using EKC with three neutral b-CDs as chiral selectors. The native b-CD and two other b-CD derivatives with different types and positions of the substituents on the CD rim ((2 -hydroxy) propyl-b-CD (HP-b-CD) and heptakis- 2, 3, 6 -tri-O-methyl-b-CD (TM-b-CD)) were employed. Apparent binding constants for each pair compound-CD were determined in order to study analyte–CD interactions. The best enantiomeric resolutions for micona-zole, econazole, and <b>sulconazole</b> were observed with HP-b-CD whereas for the separation of the enantiomers of ketoconazole, terconazole, and bifonazole, TM-b-CD was the best chiral selector. The enantioseparations obtained were discussed {{on the basis of the}} structure of the compounds taking into account that inclusion into the hydrophobic CD cavity occurred through the phenyl ring closer to the azole group. In addition, a change in the migration order for the enantiomers of two of the compounds studied (ketoconazole and terconazole) with the concentration of HP-b-CD was observed for the first time.

40|$|The soil amoebae Acanthamoeba causes Acanthamoeba keratitis, {{a severe}} sight-threatening {{infection}} of the eye and the almost universally fatal granulomatous amoebic encephalitis. More effective treatments are required. Sterol biosynthesis has been effectively targeted in numerous fungi using azole compounds that inhibit the cytochrome P 450 enzyme sterol 14 α-demethylase. Herein, using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS), we demonstrate that the major sterol of Acanthamoeba castellanii is ergosterol and identify novel putative precursors and intermediate sterols in its production. Unlike previously reported, we find no evidence of 7 -dehydrostigmasterol or any other phytosterol in Acanthamoeba. Of five azoles tested, we demonstrate that tioconazole and voriconazole have the greatest overall inhibition for all isolates of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Acanthamoeba polyphaga tested. While miconazole and <b>sulconazole</b> have intermediate activity econazole is least effective. Through GCMS, we demonstrate that voriconazole inhibits 14 α-demethylase as treatment inhibits the production of ergosterol, but results in the accumulation of the lanosterol substrate. These data provide the most complete description of sterol metabolism in Acanthamoeba, provide a putative framework for their further study and validate 14 α-demethylase as the target for azoles in Acanthamoeba...|$|E
40|$|Some small molecules, often {{hits from}} screening, form {{aggregates}} in solution that inhibit many enzymes. In contrast, drugs {{are thought to}} act specifically. To investigate this assumption, 50 unrelated drugs were tested for promiscuous inhibition via aggregation. Each drug was tested against three unrelated model enzymes: �-lactamase, chymotrypsin, and malate dehydrogenase, none of which are considered targets of these drugs. To be judged promiscuous, the drugs had to inhibit all three enzymes, {{do so in a}} time-dependent manner, be sensitive to detergent and to enzyme concentration, and form particles detectable by light scattering. Of the 50 drugs tested, 43 were nonpromiscuous by these criteria. Surprisingly, four of the drugs showed promiscuous, aggregation-based inhibition at concentrations below 100 µM: clotrimazole, benzyl benzoate, nicardipine, and delavirdine. Three other drugs also behaved as aggregation-based inhibitors, but only at high concentrations (about 400 µM). To investigate possible structureactivity relationships among promiscuous drugs, five analogues of the antifungal clotrimazole were studied. Three of these, miconazole, econazole, and <b>sulconazole,</b> were promiscuous but the other two, fluconazole and ketoconazole, were not. Using recursive partitioning, these experimental results were used to develop a model for predicting aggregate-based promiscuity...|$|E

The polymer monoliths were prepared via the copolymerization of 20 % monomers, glycidyl methacrylate, 20 % {{ethylene glycol dimethacrylate}} and 60 % porogens (36 % 1 -propanol, 18 % 1, 4 -butanediol) or 16. 4 % monomers (16 % butyl methacrylate, 0. 4 % sulfopropyl methacrylate), 23. 6 % ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and 60 % porogens (36 % 1 -propanol, 18 % 1, 4 -butanediol) along with 6 % single-walled carbon nanotubes aqueous suspension. The effect of single-walled carbon nanotubes on the chiral separation of twelve classes of pharmaceutical racemates namely; α- and β-blockers, antiinflammatory drugs, antifungal drugs, dopamine antagonists, norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors, catecholamines, sedative hypnotics, diuretics, antihistaminics, anticancer drugs and antiarrhythmic drugs was investigated. The enantioselective separation was carried out under multimodal elution to explore the chiral recognition capabilities of single-walled carbon nanotubes using reversed phase, polar organic and normal phase chromatographic conditions using nano-liquid chromatography. Baseline separation was achieved for celiprolol, chlorpheniramine, etozoline, nomifensine and <b>sulconazole</b> under multimodal elution conditions. Satisfactory repeatability was achieved through run-to-run, column-to-column and batch-to-batch investigations. Our findings demonstrate that single-walled carbon nanotubes represent a promising stationary phase for the chiral separation and may open the field for {{a new class of}} chiral selectors...|$|E
