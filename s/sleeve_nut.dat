50|$|On the superstructure, {{pre-stressed}} twisted-strand cables {{invented by}} the designer {{were used to}} advantage on both the main strands and the suspenders, meaning the time-consuming and expensive field adjustments were unnecessary. These cables debuted in the U.S. in 1931 on Steinman and Robinsonâ€™s Waldo-Hancock Bridge near Bucksport, Maine, and their St. Johns Bridge in Portland, Oregon. A new connection method, which used <b>sleeve</b> <b>nuts</b> to connect each main strand socket to its anchorage rod, was also used. These connections, invented by Robinson and first used on the Thousand Islands Bridge the previous year, made small adjustments to the main strands very easy.|$|R
50|$|Many {{differential}} screw configurations are possible. The micrometer adjuster pictured uses a <b>nut</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{with different}} {{inner and outer}} thread pitches to connect a screw on the adjusting rod end with threads inside the main barrel; as the thimble rotates the <b>nut</b> <b>sleeve,</b> the rod and barrel move relative to each other based on the differential between the threads.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Micrometer {{adjuster}} with differential threads. The threads 11 on rod 4 {{have one}} pitch (e.g. 25 tpi, blue), while the threads 10 in the barrel 1 have another (e.g. 20 tpi, orange). A full {{turn of the}} thimble 12 rotates the <b>nut</b> <b>sleeve</b> 13 and its two threads (20 tpi outside and 25 tpi inside) to move the rod 1/20 - 1/25 = 0.01 in relative to the barrel.|$|R
40|$|A tool {{makes it}} {{possible}} to couple a torque wrench to an externally knurled, internally threaded, round cable connector. The purpose served by the tool is to facilitate the tightening of multiple such connectors (or the repeated tightening of the same connector) to repeatable torques. The design of a prior cable-connector/ torque-wrench coupling tool provided for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location laterally offset from the axis of rotation of the cable connector, making it necessary to correct the torque reading for the offset. Unlike the design of the prior tool, the design of the present tool provides for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location on the axis of rotation, obviating correction of the torque reading for offset. The present tool (see figure) consists of a split collet containing a slot that provides clearance for inserting and bending the cable, a collet-locking <b>sleeve,</b> a collet-locking <b>nut,</b> and a torque-wrench adaptor that is press-fit onto the collet. Once the collet is positioned on the cable connector, the collet-locking nut is turned to force the collet-locking sleeve over the collet, compressing the collet through engagement of tapered surfaces {{on the outside of the}} collet and the inside of the locking sleeve. Because the collet is split and therefore somewhat flexible, this compression forces the collet inward to grip the connector securely. The torque wrench is then applied to the torque-wrench adaptor in the usual manner for torquing a nut or a bolt...|$|R
