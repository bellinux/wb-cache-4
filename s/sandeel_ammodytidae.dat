Since the changes in distribution and relative abundance of porpoises may be linked to the changes in prey availability, the aim of the present work was to investigate whether any changes in the feeding habits of harbour porpoises along the North Sea occurred in the past decade. The diet of harbour porpoises stranded along the southern North Sea (northern France and Belgian coast) was assessed through 3 complementary methods: stomach content analysis, stable isotopes (carbon and nitrogen) analysis determined from muscle samples, and fatty acids analysis determined from blubber samples. Fatty acid patterns and stable isotope values from 52 porpoises were compared to 14 potential prey species collected from the southern North Sea. Our results showed that the diet of porpoises along the southern North Sea comprises fish species that are among the most abundant and widely distributed in the area, except for the sardine Sardina pilchardus that appeared to be a new potential prey. Moreover, our results suggested that the decline in <b>sandeel</b> (<b>Ammodytidae)</b> in the northern parts of the North Sea along with the re-invasion of the southern North Sea by sardine species might affect {{the distribution of}} harbour porpoises...|$|E
40|$|Mortality {{during the}} egg and larval stages is thought {{to play a major}} role in {{determining}} year-class strength of many marine fish. Predation of eggs and larvae is normally considered to be a major factor but the full suite of predators responsible has rarely been identified. Potential predators on a patch of plaice Pleuronectes platessa eggs located in the eastern Irish Sea were mapped using acoustics and sampled by trawl and a plankton multi-net. Gut contents of 3373 fish, crustacea and cephalopods sampled in the area were screened using a plaice-specific TaqMan DNA probe. Herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus dominated trawl catches and showed high positive TaqMan responses (77 and 75 % of individuals tested respectively). Locations of clupeid schools also broadly corresponded with the distribution of fish eggs in the plankton. Whiting Merlangius merlangus were also reasonably abundant in trawl hauls and 86 % of their stomachs tested positive for plaice DNA. Species showing lower levels of positive TaqMan response included mackerel Scomber scombrus, poor cod Trisopterus minutus, squid Loligo spp., dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula and weever Trachinus vipera. Non-reactivity of all negative controls precluded the occurrence of cross-contamination, and positive reactions from demersal species, such as dogfish and weever, may have resulted from secondary predation. No benthic macro-crustaceans tested positive. Samples of planktonic organisms yielded 13 % positive TaqMan reactions, mainly from clupeoid or <b>sandeel</b> (<b>Ammodytidae)</b> larvae, but also included some Malacostraca and Amphipoda. Use of the molecular approach allowed rapid screening of a large number of potential predators of plaice eggs, and the results provide a more holistic description of the predator community than has previously been achieved...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the biology of, and fishery for, L. piscatorius was {{investigated}} {{primarily in the}} area around the Shetland Islands and several new findings have emerged. It was found that catch rates in the commercial fishery were generally between 5 and 15 individuals per hour towing time although there were differences between grounds and between seasons. There was evidence of a negative trend in fish size over time on one of the main fishing grounds {{during the course of this}} study. A bigger-deeper trend was found and at inshore areas a negative trend between CPUE and depth was also found. Some inshore areas may act as nursery areas. A tagging study was undertaken and recapture locations indicated a pattern of offshore migration during the autumn and winter. Some movement between different inshore grounds also occurred. The mean growth rate obtained from recaptured fish was 9 cm/year, similar to the 8 - 12 cm/year estimated from cohorts identified in length-frequency distributions. These tended to be higher than growth rates predicted from age determinations using otoliths. Lengths-at-ages given in this study tended to be higher than those previously reported. Analysis of the diet suggested opportunistic feeding, with both seasonal and geographical variation recorded. Gadoids were important, particularly during the winter and spring but <b>sandeel</b> (<b>Ammodytidae</b> spp.) dominated the diet during the summer. In situ feeding behaviour, including a direct opportunistic attack on a cod, was described for the first time and several behaviours, previously unrecorded in the species, e. g. recess creation using digging and scraping behaviours, breath holding, and spine raising in relation to the proximity of potential prey, were identified. "Walking" behaviour, using the paired fins, was also described. The autumn offshore migration may be related to changes in prey availability and / or the reproductive cycle.

40|$|The {{harp seal}} Phoca groenlandica {{is the most}} {{abundant}} seal species in the Barents Sea. In order to evaluate the ecological importance of the species, diet studies have recently been carried out at various times of the year. In 1992, {{data were collected from}} seals sampled between the breeding and moulting seasons (March-May). There {{is no doubt that the}} animals feed during this period. From examinations of stomach and intestine contents, harp seals, sampled in the southwestern parts (Varangerfjord, North Norway) of the Barents Sea, appeared to have been feeding intensively on capelin Mallotus villosus. The harp seal diet in the commercial hunting areas north of the White Sea (the East Ice) consisted of prawns Pandalus borealis, capelin, cod Gadus morhua, saithe Pollachius virens, sculpins (Cottidae), snailfish (Liparidae) and long rough dab (Hippoglossoides plattessoides). Feeding in the East Ice area and in the White Sea appeared to have been less intensive than further to the west. In the White Sea the harp seals had been feeding mainly on crustaceans and the fishes <b>sandeels</b> (<b>Ammodytidae),</b> capelin and White Sea herring (Clupea harengus marisalbi) ...|$|R
40|$|Local {{differences}} in feeding conditions {{have been suggested}} {{as a cause of}} regional variation in seabird demography but multi-colony comparisons of diet are rare. In UK waters the main fish eaten by seabirds during the breeding season belong to three families: Ammodytidae, Clupeidae and Gadidae. Climate change and fishing are affecting these fish stocks and so probably impact on predators such as seabirds. We used standardized observations of prey brought in for chicks to make the first integrated assessment of the diet of Common Guillemot Uria aalge chicks at a UK scale. Chick diet varied markedly among the 23 colonies sampled between 2006 and 2011. <b>Sandeels</b> (<b>Ammodytidae),</b> probably Lesser <b>Sandeels</b> Ammodytes marinus, were the commonest prey. Their contribution to the diet varied both latitudinally and among marine regions, with the proportion significantly higher for a given latitude on the west coast compared to the east. The non-sandeel component of the diet showed latitudinal changes, with small clupeids, probably Sprats Sprattus sprattus, predominant at southern colonies whereas juvenile gadids were the main alternative to sandeels in the north. Comparison of our Guillemot chick diet with data collected 15 – 30 years earlier suggests that the proportion of sandeels in the diet has decreased at colonies bordering the North Sea. No significant change was apparent in Atlantic colonies but historical data were limited. The early years of our study coincided with a population explosion of Snake Pipefish Entelurus aequoreus in the Northeast Atlantic and North Sea. Pipefish were recorded in Guillemot chick diet at several northern and northwestern colonies in 2006 and 2007 but have been absent since 2009. Spatial and temporal variation in chick diet accorded broadly with patterns expected as a result of rising sea temperatures and impacts of fishing. Guillemot chick diet could potentially be a useful indicator of changes in the distribution and abundance of forage fish. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The harbour {{porpoise}} (Phocoena phocoena) {{is probably the}} most abundant small cetacean in the northeast Atlantic and as such is an important top predator. It {{is also one of the}} most threatened species, particularly as a consequence of fishery by-catch. Porpoises feed mainly on small shoaling fishes from both demersal and pelagic habitats. Many prey items are probably taken on, or very close to, the sea bed. Even though a wide range of species has been recorded in the diet, porpoises in any one area tend to feed primarily on two to four main species (e. g. whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and <b>sandeels</b> (<b>Ammodytidae)</b> in Scottish waters). Evidence for selective predation is equivocal. Many studies provide evidence of geographic, seasonal, interannual, ontogenetic or sexual differences in prey types or prey sizes, and such dif-ferences are often (speculatively) interpreted in terms of prey availability. A few studies demon-strate trends in diet selection that are consistent with changes in prey abundance. However, lack of availability of prey abundance data at an appropriate spatial and temporal scale is often a problem. Porpoise diets overlap extensively with diets of other piscivorous marine predators (notably seals). Many of the main prey species are also taken by commercial fisheries, although por-poises tend to take smaller fishes than those targeted by fisheries. Given their high abundance, porpoises clearly remove substantial quantities of fish. The literature on porpoise diets in the northeast Atlantic suggests that there has been a long-term shift from predation on clupeid fish (mainly herring Clupea harengus) to predation on sandeels and gadoid fish, possibly related to the decline in herring stocks since the mid- 1960 s. Evidence from studies on seals suggests that such a shift could have adverse health con-sequences. Food consumption brings porpoises into contact with two important threats – persistent organic contaminants and fishing nets, both of which have potentially serious impacts...|$|R
40|$|The harbour {{porpoise}} Phocoena phocoena {{is currently the}} most abundant marine mammal in Belgian waters. Large-scale changes {{in the distribution of}} this top predator in the North Sea have occurred during the last decades, possibly caused by changes in food availability. An analysis of the strandings database 1970 - 2011, containing data on 737 {{harbour porpoise}}s, revealed that throughout the year two peaks in strandings occurred: one in spring, for an important part caused by the strandings of animals incidentally bycaught in fishing gear, and a second one during summer. Most of the stranded animals were juveniles, with a higher percentage of males than females. As could be expected, bycaught animals were on average heavier than equally sized naturally died animals, and they had a thicker blubber layer. In naturally died animals the blubber layer was thicker in winter than in summer, illustrating the insulating function of the blubber layer besides its function as an energy storage. We investigated the stomach content of 64 harbour porpoises washed ashore or bycaught in Belgium between 1997 and 2011. Ten of the stomachs were empty. Fish contributed to most of the prey remains. In total we found the remains of 19 fish species belonging to 10 families. The numerically most important prey items in juveniles were gobies (Gobiidae). Reconstructing the original weight of the prey items revealed that gobies constituted the most important prey by weight, but that larger <b>sandeels</b> (<b>Ammodytidae)</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} gadoids (Gadidae) were also important. In adults the majority of prey items were gobies and sandeels, but the reconstructed weight of the stomach content revealed that sandeels and gadoids constituted by far the most important prey. Surprisingly, clupeids (Clupeidae) did not contribute much to the diet, although the return of the harbour porpoise is often linked to an increase in herring Clupea harengu stocks in the southern North Sea. Also no twaite shad Alosa fallax were found, although this diadromic fish is common again in the area. A small number of smelt Osmerus eperlanus was found in some of the recently stranded harbour porpoises. Smelt is a diadromic fish of which densities are increasing from very low levels. The fact that juvenile harbour porpoises had apparently fed on large quantities of small bottom fish may help to explain why they were more prone to bycatch than adults. The analysis revealed that a gradual shift occurs in the feeding habits of harbour porpoises while becoming adults: from small benthic fish towards larger fish taken from the water column...|$|R
