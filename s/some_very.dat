5|$|Akodon caenosus is a rodent in {{the genus}} Akodon found in northwestern Argentina and south-central Bolivia.

5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at <b>some</b> <b>very</b> early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E

The Philippine eagle {{is part of the}} Accipitridae family and is endemic to the rainforests of Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry is {{the most}} {{commonly}} known and widely studied of mimicry complexes, such that the word mimicry is often treated as synonymous with Batesian mimicry. There are many other forms however, <b>some</b> <b>very</b> similar in principle, others far separated. It is often contrasted with Müllerian mimicry, a form of mutually beneficial convergence between two or more harmful species. However, because the mimic may have a degree of protection itself, the distinction is not absolute. It can also be contrasted with functionally different forms of mimicry. Perhaps the sharpest contrast here is with aggressive mimicry, where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species, avoiding detection and improving its foraging success.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} only one fossil Nectocaris was known, poorly {{preserved}} {{and without a}} counterpart. This fossil was a puzzle, as its head looked rather like that of an arthropod but its body, with {{what seemed to be}} fins along its back and belly, looked rather like of a chordate's. In 2010 Smith and Caron described another 91 specimens, <b>some</b> <b>very</b> good, and reconstructed it as a cephalopod, and the earliest one as of 2010. Unlike later cephalopods it had only two arms, and its eyes seem mounted on stalks. But it had a soft funnel, similar to the ones used for propulsion by modern cephalopods.|$|E
5|$|In <b>some</b> <b>very</b> small insects, the venation may {{be greatly}} reduced. In Chalcidoidea (Chalcid wasps), for instance, only the subcosta {{and part of}} the radius are present. Conversely, an {{increase}} in venation may occur by the branching of existing veins to produce accessory veins or by the development of additional, intercalary veins between the original ones, as in the wings of Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets). Large numbers of cross-veins are present in some insects, and they may form a reticulum as in the wings of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and {{at the base of the}} forewings of Tettigonioidea and Acridoidea (katydids and grasshoppers respectively).|$|E
5|$|In {{the north}} of the {{constellation}} is the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, a dark molecular cloud with many embedded reflection nebulae, including NGC 6729, NGC 6726–7, and IC 4812.

The related NGC 6726 and 6727, along with unrelated NGC 6729, were first recorded by Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt in 1865. The Coronet cluster, about 554 light years (170 parsecs) away at the edge of the Gould Belt, is also used in studying star and protoplanetary disk formation.|$|E

5|$|Nanticoke Creek, {{like the}} nearby Nanticoke city and Nanticoke Falls, {{is named for}} a group of Nanticoke People who for a time had a village in the Wyoming Valley before Europeans settled there. The creek was known as Muddy Run on <b>some</b> <b>very</b> early maps of the area. However, its current name was {{appearing}} on maps as early as 1776. The creek has also historically been referred to by many other names, including Lee's Creek, Miller's Creek, Robbins Creek, Bobbs Creek, Rummage Creek, and Warrior Run Creek. All of these names were described as erroneous in Henry C. Bradsby's 1893 book History of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Nettlecombe Park is {{important}} for its lichen flora. Records suggest this site has been wood pasture or parkland for at least 400 years. There are <b>some</b> <b>very</b> old oak pollards which may be of this age or older. The oldest standard trees are over 200 years of age. The continuity of open woodland and parkland, with large mature and over-mature timber, has enabled characteristic species of epiphytic lichens and beetles to become established and persist. Many of the species in the park are now nationally scarce because this type of habitat has been eliminated over large areas of Great Britain. The park was notified as an SSSI in 1990.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>very</b> fragmentary fossils {{belonging}} to pteranodontian pterosaurs, and possibly Pteranodon itself, {{have also been}} found on the Gulf Coast and East Coast of the United States.

Some remains from Japan have also been tentatively attributed to Pteranodon, but their distance from its known Western Interior Seaway habitat makes this identification unlikely.|$|E
