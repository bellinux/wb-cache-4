40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the potential of fused-slurry coatings for improving the oxidation resistance of wrought alloys. Slurry-aluminised coatings were deposited on Alloy 800 H (Fe- 33 Ni- 20 Cr), Alloy HCM 12 A (Fe- 12 Cr- 2 W), Alloy 214 (Ni- 16 Cr- 4 Al- 3 Fe), Fe- 27 Cr- 4 Al and Fe- 14 Cr- 4 Al alloys. The slurry contained a cellulose-based binder in an aqueous carrier and <b>spherical</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder,</b> with a particle size below 20 microns. The slurries were applied with a paint-brush, dried in air and heat treated in either hydrogen or argon at temperatures between 700 and 1150 C. The slurries were characterised by thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry and viscometry. The coatings were characterised by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray diffraction and Vickers hardness measurements. The oxidation resistance of selected slurry-coated specimens was assessed in air at 1000 and 1100 C in tests lasting up to 1000 hours. Slurry-aluminising was found to be a simple, effective way of forming protective coatings that were similar in composition and microstructure to chemical vapour deposits. However, it was difficult to control the amount of slurry applied to the substrate and produce coatings of uniform thickness. The coatings on Alloy HCM 12 A and the Fe-Cr-Al alloys contained cracks in the brittle FeAl phase due to tensile stresses arising from differences in the thermal expansion coefficients of the substrates and the coatings. Rapid interdiffusion between the coatings and the ferritic substrates resulted in the appearance of Kirkendall voids. Coatings on Alloy 214 required a two-stage heat treatment to convert the brittle δ-Ni 2 Al 3 to β-NiAl. Cracking along the coating/substrate interface was prevented by limiting the coating thickness to a maximum of 250 microns. During oxidation at 1100 C, the β-NiAl was converted to γ'-Ni 3 Al. After 1000 h, the centre of the coating consisted chiefly of γ'-Ni 3 Al and bands of austenite (γ-Ni) were present at the inner and outer edges of the coating. The aluminium content at the coated surface was higher than the original aluminium content of the alloy, the protective alumina scale was improved and the oxidation life of the substrate was extended. An additional life of 1250 h at 1100 C is estimated from a slurry coating before the aluminium content returns to that of the original alloy (4 %), providing a potential improvement in oxidation resistance. Microstructural changes such as grain growth, sensitisation and formation of aluminium nitride particles near the coating/substrate interface, were detected in the alloy substrates after forming the slurry coatings. However, these microstructural changes did not detract from the good performance of the coatings during oxidation tests at 1100 C. The work in this study has demonstrated a low-cost method of coating high-temperature alloys providing coatings with microstructures, densities and modes of degradation similar to those obtained by other coating methods. The coatings are potentially applicable {{to a wide range of}} high-temperature substrates. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Three stamped <b>aluminium</b> <b>powders</b> were {{injected}} into the lungs of rats. One powder contained stearine and another mineral oil, whilst the third had had its lubricant removed. The powders produced a rapid and marked fibrosis of equal severity. It is concluded that aluminium rather than any additive in the powders is the fibrogenic agent. The protective action of stearine demonstrated in vitro was not confirmed in vivo, suggesting that pulmonary fibrosis may also occur in men handling stearine-containing powders. Such a case has recently been reported by McLaughlin et al. (1962), but this is exceptional to the general in-dustrial experience.

40|$|In this study, it {{is going}} to {{investigate}} properties of lightweight geopolymer specimens aerated by <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder.</b> It has been established well that <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder</b> can be appropriately used for foaming of traditional concrete. Reaction between <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder</b> and alkali activator in geopolymers of this study caused high porous structures based on the weight ratios of constituent materials. Different specimens were made by changing sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, and alkali activator to fly ash weight ratios. Fly ash was substituted by <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder</b> with 1. 5, 3. 0 and 5. 0 wt. % in different mixtures. Results indicated that substituting of 5. 0 wt. % of fly ash by <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder</b> in the specimens with alkali activator to fly ash weight ratio of 0. 35 and sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide weight ratio of 2. 5 causes the best foamed specimen with the lowest density. Compressive strength of all aerated specimens were in the range of 0. 9 - 4. 35 MPa, which is suitable for using as bricks, fire-resistant panels, buried pipeline and so on. Finally, SEM analysis was conducted to evaluate the microstructure of successfully aerated geopolymer. It was seen that in highly aerated specimens, the foaming reaction is too fast that prevents complete alkali activation of geopolymers and many unreacted fly ash particles remains...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the properties of high-energy ball-milled nanocrystalline <b>aluminium</b> <b>powders</b> and to determine the optimum milling time required to produce an advanced <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder</b> for selective laser melting (SLM). Previous research has indicated that powders suitable for SLM include milled nanocrystalline <b>aluminium</b> <b>powders</b> with an average grain size of 60 nm and good flowability (Carr index less than 15 %). This study employs advanced nanometrology methods and analytical techniques to investigate the powder morphology, phase identification, average grain size and flowability of ball-milled powders. Stearic acid is used to prevent excessive cold welding of the ball-milled powder and to reduce abrasion of the grinding bowl and balls. The results indicate that, whilst the average particle size achieves a steady state after 14 h of milling, the grain size continues to decrease as the milling time progressed (e. g. the transmission electron microscopy measured average grain size is 56 nm after 20 h of milling compared to 75 nm for 14 h of milling). The <b>aluminium</b> <b>powders</b> milled for 16 and 20 h exhibit good flow behaviour, achieving a Carr index of 13. 5 and 15. 8 %, respectively.

40|$|The SLS/SLM of <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder</b> {{had been}} {{investigated}} {{by studying the}} effect of powder properties and laser processing parameters on the microstructures and properties of both single layer and multiple layer builds. On the basis of experimental evidence, the SLS/SLM of <b>aluminium</b> <b>powders</b> could be categorised into full melting (SLM) which {{was found to have}} occurred in both pure and pre-alloyed <b>aluminium</b> <b>powders,</b> and binary liquid phase sintering (SLS) which occurred in blended bimodal or trimodal powders. That successful disruption of the oxide film is possible is a significant result, as is the constitutional effect on this. The spheroidisation and oxide disruption phenomena in SLS/SLM processed <b>aluminium</b> <b>powders</b> arc suggested to be mainly controlled by the amount of oxide on the as-received powder's surface, the degree of the uniformity of the distribution of the surface oxide film covering the aluminium particles as well as the nature of thermal mismatch existing between the oxide film and the parent aluminium particle which was dependent on the phase present in the oxide film (alumina, mullite, and spinel). It was discovered that the attainment of high sintered density and desirable microstructural properties in the blended <b>aluminium</b> <b>powders</b> is consequent upon the determination of the right processing conditions, appropriate choice of powders (in terms of particle size distribution, spherical particle shape, and component ratio). Moreover, it is now evident that chemical constitution of the blended <b>aluminium</b> <b>powders</b> only becomes influential in the determination of the properties of SLS processed parts when the choice of processing parameters and powder properties are correct. The choice of powder properties determines the thermal conductivity of the powder bed which in effect controls the sintered properties. This had been inferred from the relationship between powder tapping density on one hand, and selective laser sintered (SLS) density, dendrite spacing and fraction of primary phase on the other hand. In making smaller samples, {{it has been shown that}} the attainment of high sintered density (up to 90 %) and a good microstructure are feasible. These arc accompanied by reasonable hardness values, comparable to those of cast Al- 12 wt%Si castings. In fabricating larger sized parts for mechanical testing, defects such as delamination became more noticeable leading to poor mechanical properties in those samples. Thus, it is now clear that physical limitations of the sintering machine hinder the production of SLS/SLM processed parts having excellent structural integrity. On the basis of this work, it is envisaged that the use of pre-alloyed Al-Si powders of uniform composition, but a wider particle size and size distribution, blended to optimise the bed density, offers the potential to produce light alloy components by SLS. In conclusion, the specific laser energy input, the component ratio, and the particle size and size distribution of the powder were found to have strongly influenced the densitication mechanism and the solidification process in a small sized <b>aluminium</b> <b>powdered</b> part fabricatedb y SLS/SLM process.
