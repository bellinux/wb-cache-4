40|$|A {{linguistic}} and cultural analysis of diving <b>site</b> <b>names</b> {{and their role}} as toponyms is absent in scuba diving tourism research and landscape research. This paper argues for using place-names for the identification of historical landscape features and that diving <b>site</b> <b>names</b> as place-names and historical landscape features could be of interest for creating and documenting coastal and underwater landscape inventories. It claims that diving <b>site</b> <b>names</b> of Kangaroo Island, South Australia, and diving site toponymy in general, are linguistic ephemera linked to tourism activities, which may provide {{a greater understanding of}} the ‘linguistics of landscape’, the ‘linguistic landscape’, and the ‘landscape of language’. In conclusion, this paper speculates about the function of diving <b>site</b> <b>names</b> as worthwhile pilgrimage locations connected with tourism of particular cultural landscapes.
