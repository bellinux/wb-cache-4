5000|$|Three-dimensionality in {{turbomachine}} increases {{complexity in}} flow field so, determination of losses becomes difficult unlike two-dimensional losses where equation complexity is little. Three-dimensionality includes large pressure gradients in every direction, design/curvature of blade, shock wave, heat transfer, cavitation and viscous effects, which generates secondary flow, vortices, tip leakage vortices and other losses. Viscous effects in turbomachinery causes blockage to the flow by formation of viscous layers around blade profile which effect pressure rise/fall and reduce effective area of flow field. Interaction between these losses in rotor increase instability and decreases in efficiency of turbomachinery. In calculation of three-dimensional losses every parameter comes into picture of flow path like axial spacing between vane and blade rows, end wall curvature, radial distribution of pressure gradient, hup/tip ratio, dihedral, lean, tip clearance, flare, aspect ratio, skew, sweep, platform cooling holes, surface roughness, off take bleeds.

So, correlations {{are dependent on}} so many parameter it becomes difficult to correlate. Correlation based on geometric similarity has been developed by many industries in form of charts, graphs, data statistics and performance data. Two-dimensional losses are easily evaluated by Navier-Stokes code but three-dimensional losses are difficult to evaluate so, correlation is used.

A simple semianalytical Rayleigh-Ritz model is derived in which the disk possesses all six rigid body degrees of freedom, which are elastically constrained by the shaft. Inertial coupling by the rigid body motion of the disk on a flexible shaft and out-of-plane elastic coupling due to disk flexure are included.

The A/D signal collection includes inlet static pressure, outlet static pressure, outlet total pressure, rotor speed and torque signal, then the efficiency can be calculated in the DSP, and the angle signal for the stepping motor which control the IGV will be sent out from the D/A.

30|$|The above {{results suggest}} that the <b>stagger</b> <b>angle</b> {{definitely}} affects the pressure fluctuation characteristics in the volute casing; in particular, it decreases the amplitude on the blade passage frequency. When the impeller <b>stagger</b> <b>angle</b> is 24 ° or 36 °, the distribution of pressure fluctuations in the volute casing becomes more uniform than the other impeller configurations, and the level of pressure fluctuation can be reduced by up to 50 %. Staggered impellers may redistribute the flow pattern at the region of the impeller outlet and affect the jet-wake flow field. In this way, the staggered impeller changes the strength of the interaction between the impeller and the volute tongue.|$|E

A MarkForged Mark One 3 D printer was used to print components of a carbon-fiber composite cross-flow fan rotor.

These performance characteristics were compared to a rotor of the same geometry previously manufactured from traditional carbon fiber components. The optimum <b>stagger</b> <b>angle</b> for the current 26 -bladed, 101. 6 mm (4 inch) diameter rotor was determined to be 10 ¡ forward of its previous position. The 3 D printed rotor was found to produce less thrust, but also required less power.

Today, wind energy is mainly used to generate electricity. Wind is a renewable energy source. Power production from {{wind turbines}} is affected by certain conditions: wind speed, turbine speed, turbulence and the changes of wind direction. These conditions are not always optimal and have negative effects on most turbines.

40|$|A novel {{dynamic model}} for a pretwisted {{rotating}} compressor blade mounted at an arbitrary <b>stagger</b> <b>angle</b> using general shell theory and including the rotational velocity is developed to study the eigenfrequencies and damping properties of the pretwisted rotating blade. The strain-displacement relation and constitutive model based on the general (thick) shell theory are applied {{to bring out the}} strain energy of the rotating blade. Using the Hamilton's principle, the variational form of the total energy is derived in order to obtain the corresponding weak form for the numerical simulation. The model is validated by comparing to literature results and Ansys results, showing good agreement. Parametric analyses are carried out to study the influence of the rotation velocity, the <b>stagger</b> <b>angle</b> and the radius of the disk on the eigenfrequencies of the pretwisted blade. Proportional damping is included into the proposed model to investigate the influence of rotational velocity on the damping characteristics of the pretwisted rotating blade system.

One of the simpler tools to analyse such turbines is the blade element/actuator disc methodology. This requires the input of “interference factors” to model how the lift and drag characteristics of the cascade of blades on the turbine rotor are related to those of a single isolated aerofoil. In {{the first part of the}} paper, CFD modelling to obtain the lift and drag characteristics of various aerofoils arranged in linear cascades at different <b>stagger</b> <b>angles</b> is described. The CFD cascade lift and drag data are compared with reported experimental cascade aerodynamic data. The agreement within the range of usable <b>stagger</b> <b>angles</b> is excellent in the pre-stall range with some deviations shown in the post-stall.
