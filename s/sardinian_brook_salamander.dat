50|$|The <b>Sardinian</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> or Sardinian {{mountain}} newt (Euproctus platycephalus) is {{a species}} of salamander in the Salamandridae family found only in Sardinia, Italy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Sardinian</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> is {{endemic to}} the mountainous {{areas on the}} east side of the island of Sardinia in the Mediterranean Sea. It is found at altitudes between 50 and 1800 m, with most {{sightings}} being in the middle of this range. It is found in slow-moving streams and rivers, small lakes, and ponds, where it hides under stones. When on land, it is usually found in undergrowth or under stones, and usually stays close to water.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Sardinian</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> is {{classified}} by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as endangered, because the area it occupies {{is less than}} 500 km2 in total and fragmented {{into a number of}} separate populations. It is threatened by loss of habitat, pollution of watercourses, dry conditions caused by the excessive extraction of water, and disturbance due to tourism. Its numbers appear to be dwindling. Most of the specimens found were male and the species seems to be no longer present in some locations where it was previously found.|$|E

50|$|Pseudoeurycea unguidentis is {{a species}} of {{salamander}} in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to northern Oaxaca, Mexico, where it is known from its type locality, Cerro San Felipe, and some other mountains, although the identity of animals from these other locations is uncertain. Its common names are claw-toothed <b>salamander,</b> clawtooth false <b>brook</b> <b>salamander,</b> and clawtoed false <b>brook</b> <b>salamander.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rare amphibians, {{found only}} on the island, are the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander,</b> brown cave salamander, {{imperial}} cave salamander, Monte Albo cave salamander, Supramonte cave salamander and Sarrabus cave salamander (Speleomantes sarrabusensis); the Sardinian tree frog {{is also found in}} Corsica and in the Tuscan Archipelago. Among reptiles worthy of note are Bedriaga's rock lizard, the Tyrrhenian wall lizard and Fitzinger's algyroides, endemic species of Sardinia and Corsica. The island is inhabited by terrestrial tortoises and sea turtles like Hermann's tortoise, the spur-thighed tortoise, marginated tortoise (Testudo marginata sarda), Nabeul tortoise, loggerhead sea turtle and green sea turtle. A new arachnid species, endemic to the island, has been recently found: the Nuragic spider.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Sardinian</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> {{can grow}} to about 15 cm in length, but adults are usually rather smaller than this, with females {{being a bit}} larger than males. It {{is very similar to}} the Corsican brook salamander, but the head is flatter, the throat is more spotted, and the paratoid glands are smaller. The lower jaw is shorter than the upper jaw. The skin is smooth apart from a few irregularly placed tubercles. The colour is olive, grey, or reddish-brown, often with red, brown, or black spots and {{longitudinal}} streaks, and often a thin yellow or brown stripe occurs along the spine. The underside is paler, often having a red or yellow central region and black spots. The male has a spur on each hind limb. The only species with which {{it is likely to be}} confused are cave salamanders in the family Plethodontidae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Sardinian</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> {{is largely}} aquatic, {{though it does}} {{hibernate}} and sometimes aestivate on land near the water's edge. Mating {{takes place in the}} water, the male having first carried the passive female in his jaws to a suitable location. He clasps her body with his jaws and bends his body around, wrapping his tail around hers. He transfers spermatophores to her cloaca from his cloaca, sometimes with the aid of his spurs. The female lays up to 220 eggs singly over a period of weeks in crevices and under stones and possibly buried in sand. She forms her mobile cloaca into a tube and turns on her back to deposit them in suitable locations. The larvae take six to 15 months before metamorphosis depending on the water temperature. In 1999, sexually mature adults were reported to have been found with the vestiges of gills, suggesting the species may exhibit paedomorphosis.|$|E
50|$|Pseudoeurycea mystax is {{a species}} of {{salamander}} in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to Mexico and only known from the area of its type locality near Ayutla, Oaxaca. Its common name is mustache false <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> or mustached false <b>brook</b> <b>salamander.</b> The specific name refers to the whitish protuberances on the lips that resemble a mustache in the frontal view of the male holotype.|$|R

50|$|The Corsican brook {{salamander}} {{is smaller}} than other closely related species, such as the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> (Euproctus platycephalus) and can grow to around 13 cm in length, though a more typical size is 10 cm. The head is long with a rounded snout, and the tail is oval in cross section {{and as long as}} the rest of the animal. The parotoid glands on the side of the neck are distinct. The males have spurs on the hind legs and a backwards-pointing conical cloaca, whereas the females have a cloaca with a ventral opening. The skin is smooth when it is living in the water, but becomes more granular when living on land. The colour is brown or olive, sometimes with mottling of orange, red, or brown, particularly near the spine. It has a paler, fairly uniformly coloured underside, sometimes with white flecks, but is not spotted on the throat. The only other salamander on the island is the Corsican fire salamander (Salamandra corsica) which has distinctive black and yellow colouring.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Sardinian</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander,</b> Euproctus platycephalus, is a cryptically {{coloured}} urodele {{found in}} streams, springs and pools {{in the main}} mountain systems of Sardinia, and is classified as critically endangered by IUCN. General reviews of the mountainous range where salamanders occur are numerous, but very few field-based distribution studies exist on this endemic species. Through a field and questionnaire survey, conducted between 1999 and 2001, we report a first attempt to increase data on the present distribution of E. platycephalus. A total of 14 localities where Sardinian salamanders are represented by apparently stable {{and in some cases}} abundant populations have been identified, as well as 30 sites where species presence has been recorded after 1991. Some 11 historical sites were identified which are no longer inhabited by the species. The implications of this distributional study for the conservation of the species and for the realization of an updated atlas are discussed...|$|E
