Inventory was done in systematic random way and intensity of 3. 3 % in both years. In this research parameters like average diameter of basal area mean (in breast height), volume mean and density in ha, diameter distribution, regeneration situation and qualitative class of trees were studied. Totally this study's results showed that although the diameter distribution curve in 2003 was getting close to the normal curve, as compared with 1993, but was still for from it in district. Also against the reduction of volume mean in ha, diameter of basal area mean and the percentage of trees in high qualitative classes in both methods were reduced, we should point that, this reduction in single selection parcels is less than <b>strip</b> <b>cutting</b> parcels. Results of studying the density in ha of trees and regeneration show the equal increasing process in both groups of parcels (single selection and <b>strip</b> <b>cutting).</b> Generally according to failure of the plan, with comparing both methods, we can conclude that we can get better results of single selection rather than <b>strip</b> <b>cutting.</b> Meanwhile considering 68 % <b>strip</b> <b>cutting</b> harvest of the district the majority of <b>strip</b> <b>cutting</b> is affecting the failure of the plan...|$|E

CO was assessed in a primary forest and two forests logged selectively using reduced impact logging. At one site, 3 -m-wide <b>strip</b> <b>cutting</b> was conducted for line planting. From the comparison of CO among the three sites, we found significant changes caused by logging. However, no significant difference was observed between the two logged sites. <b>Strip</b> <b>cutting</b> treatment did not affect CO. One year after, significant canopy closure occurred in both of the logged sites. Canopy closure was significant regardless of the disturbance element, logging gap, skid trail, or <b>strip</b> <b>cutting</b> line.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} the <b>cutting</b> <b>strip</b> of an outside decomposition of a skew shape, and show that <b>cutting</b> <b>strips</b> are in one-to-one correspondence with outside decompositions for a given skew shape. Outside decompositions are introduced by Hamel and Goulden and are used to give an identity for the skew Schur function that unifies the determinantal expressions for the skew Schur functions including the Jacobi-Trudi determinant, its dual, the Giambelli determinant and the rim ribbon determinant due to Lascoux and Pragacz. Using <b>cutting</b> <b>strips,</b> one obtains a formula for the number of outside decompositions of a given skew shape. Moreover, one can define the basic transformations which we call the twist transformation among <b>cutting</b> <b>strips,</b> and derive a transformation theorem for the determinantal formula of Hamel and Goulden. The special case of the transformation theorem for the Giambelli identity and the rim ribbon identity was obtained by Lascoux and Pragacz.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the generation of undeveloped bamboo sprouts after <b>strip</b> <b>cutting</b> in an bamboo stand in Satsuma Town, Kagoshima Prefecture, which had been unmanaged for about 20 years. After <b>strip</b> <b>cutting</b> was performed in July and September 2005 and in March 2006, we counted the number of culms and undeveloped bamboo sprouts and found that there were three bumper years and two bad years during a 5 -year period. The number of sprouts, culms, and undeveloped bamboo sprouts increased over time. The number of undeveloped bamboo sprouts in bumper years was more than that in bad years, and the same tendency applied to the percentage of undeveloped bamboo sprouts. The number of undeveloped bamboo sprouts in a plot cut in March was greater than those in plots cut in July and September. There might be a relation between the cutting season and the generation of bamboo sprouts. On the other hand, in the control plot, the percentage of undeveloped bamboo sprouts in bumper years was lower than that in a bad year. The result for the control plot was opposite that for the cutting plots. The cutting plots had not recovered before <b>strip</b> <b>cutting,</b> and the number of undeveloped bamboo sprouts increased gradually; thus, we must continue to investigate this site to confirm a relation between cutting season and sprout generation. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} of three concessionaires in Kalimantan practicing {{the trial of}} Indonesian <b>Strip</b> <b>Cutting</b> and Planting System was conducted in 1994. All the companies are in the early stage of the trial and, therefore, the focus of investigation is limited to trial preparation and timber harvesting {{with the aim of}} describing the real practices and various problems faced in the field. It is found that the productivity of each activity in preparation and timber harvesting in the Indonesian Strip Curing and Planting System (A) is lower than those in the Indonesian Selective Cutting and Planting System (B). The comparison of several productivities are as follows : (I) Felling: 47 cu. m/day forA and 85 cu. m/day for B: (2) Skidding : 37 cu. m/day for A and 85 cu. m/day for B; (3) Loading-unloading : 55 cu. m/day for A and 150 cu. m/day for B; (4) Hauling :. 50 cu. m/trip forA and 64 cu. m/trip for B. The above figures and observation in the field lead to the notion of several problems faced such as : (1) in matching the required strip direction and real field condition; (3) improper skill of workers; (4) unsuitable wage system; (5) inability to utilize the small diameter logs; (6) too large cable used for skidding; (7) too large log clamp available on loader tractor: (8) difficulty in handling small diameter logs onto logging truck; and (9) high percentage of land area disturbed due to large equipment and strip width limitation.

Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to determine the spatial variation (in vertical stratification and horizontal structure) of deciduous forest vegetation in three strip corridors of variable widths (30, 60 and 90 metres). To this effect, quantitative measures of composition and specific diversity have been taken, as well as other measures of variables closely related to vegetation. The use of factorial methods (correspondence analysis, grouping method) completes the information gathered on vegetation dynamism in strip corridors. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the width of the corridor has, to a certain extent, a structuring effect on composition and specific diversity, and has an influence on the succession pattern.

40|$|We study a <b>strip</b> <b>cutting</b> {{problem that}} arises in the {{production}} of corrugated cardboard. In this context, rectangular items of different sizes are obtained by machines, called corrugators, that cut strips of large dimensions according to particular schemes containing at most two types of items. Because of buffer restrictions, these schemes have to be sequenced in such a way that, at any moment, at most two types of items are in production and not completed yet (sequencing constraint). We show that the problem of finding a set of schemes of minimum trim loss that satisfies an assigned demand for each item size is strongly NP-hard, even if the sequencing constraint is relaxed. Then, we present two heuristics for the problem with the sequencing constraint, both based on a graph characterization of the feasible solutions. The first heuristic is a two-phase procedure based on a mixed integer linear programming model. The second heuristic follows a completely combinatorial approach and consists of solving a suitable sequence of minimum cost matching problems. For both procedures, an upper bound on the number of schemes (setups) is found. Finally, a computational study comparing the quality of the heuristic solutions with respect to an LP lower bound is reported...|$|E

The changes of bird community composition based on foraging behavior in relation to 3 different harvesting systems, including <b>strip</b> <b>cutting,</b> group selection logging, and single tree selection logging, was evaluated in a virgin area in this study. Birds and environmental variables were detected within 103 circle sampling plots with 25 m radius. Based on the results, 4 groups of birds were observed in treatments based on the foraging behavior. Group 1 was ground foragers, group 2 consisted of foliage gleaning, group 3 included flycatchers, and group 4 represented bark foraging. The first group had the highest abundance in the strip treatment. The second group in group selection treatment, and the third and fourth groups had the highest abundance in the virgin area and then, in single tree selection treatment. The first group showed the highest correlation with shrub and herb or grass layer, stone cover and the number of trees 10 - 20 m in height. The second, third and fourth groups showed the highest correlation with the number of trees> 20 m in height, basal areas, dead trees number, and the number of fagus trees.

30|$|In today’s {{world of}} industrialization, mass {{production}} and high material utilization are the crucial factors for growing industries that necessitate {{the need of}} finding correct cutting patterns which {{may result in a}} small improvement. In the long term, it leads to huge economical saving. These problems occur at wide scale in many industries such as wood, textile, rubber, glass, etc., where the complexity is determined by the shape of the item to be cut and the number of applicable constraints. Textile and shipping industries basically deal with irregular shaped items. Automation in a packing system saves much economic time and is preferred over the manual system. One case study discussing <b>strip</b> <b>cuttings</b> in wooden industries is discussed in Lefrançois and Gascon (1995) for a manufacturer of prefabricated doors and windows. These industries follow a daily production schedule where the desired length which may be wood, steel, plastic, etc., are cut to smaller length, either by automation or by manual labor. The policy followed is basically to meet the higher demand length first, followed by others in order of their decreasing length. The main concern for these industries is efficient utilization of available resources with minimum scrap production. The shorter length stock incapable of fulfilling any order demand is termed as scrap. The textile industry also tackles this problem, but under a different heading, namely Nesting and Marker making. It involves finding the best layout for the cutting of irregular shapes, where the shapes are allowed a rotation from 0 ° to 180 °. Regular and irregular shape packing are addressed in the shipbuilding industries where it is required to investigate how the irregular size items can be packed and transported in huge containers. In today’s scenario of surplus demand, an automated system is required for efficient packing thereby reducing the transportation damage risk. The packing problem is not limited to industries, but can also be seen in other dimensions like in very-large-scale integration design, memory allocation during storage and in the field of optical fiber communication.|$|R
