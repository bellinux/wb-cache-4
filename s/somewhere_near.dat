5|$|The group {{travelled}} north, passing present-day Chillicothe, Ohio, {{on the way}} to a Mingo {{village on}} the north side of the Mad River, <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> present-day Logan County, Ohio. During the trip the Indians killed and scalped Martin's child, which they found burdensome. Martin responded by screaming in grief; when the Indians' threats to scalp her did not quiet her screams, they whipped her until she was silent. Alder's life was spared due to his appearance. His captors thought his black hair would allow him to pass as an Indian.|$|E
5|$|Cardcaptor Sakura {{takes place}} in the fictional Japanese city of Tomoeda which is <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> Tokyo. Ten-year-old Sakura Kinomoto accidentally {{releases}} a set of magical cards known as Clow Cards from a book in her basement created and named after the sorcerer Clow Reed. Each card has its own unique ability and can assume an alternate form when activated. The guardian of the cards, Cerberus, emerges from the book and chooses Sakura to retrieve the missing cards. As she finds each card, she battles its magical personification and defeats it by sealing it away. Cerberus acts as her guide, while her best friend and second cousin, Tomoyo Daidouji films her exploits and provides her with battle costumes. Sakura's older brother Toya Kinomoto watches over her, while pretending that he is unaware of what is going on.|$|E

5|$|Philip {{probably}} also campaigned in Thrace in late 352 BC, possibly {{after returning to}} Macedon from Thessaly. At this point, if not before, Philip defeated Amadokos and subjugated him, and possibly also expelled Cetriporis from his client kingship. During the campaign, Philip's army reached deep into Kersebleptes' territory and laid siege to the fortress of Heraion Teichos located <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> Perinthos, {{on the coast of}} the Propontis (although Buckler places this siege in 353 BC). On learning of the siege, the Athenians voted to dispatch 40 triremes to oppose Philip. However, they then heard that Philip had died (or had been taken ill), so the relief mission never actually sailed. It seems clear that Philip did fall ill during the campaign, but exactly how the campaign ended is unclear. It was probably at this time that Philip took Kersebleptes' son as a hostage to Pella, effectively ending Kersebleptes' freedom of action.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no direct}} sources {{describing}} {{the conquest of}} the Chajoma by the Spanish but {{it appears to have}} been a drawn-out campaign rather than a rapid victory. The only description of the conquest of the Chajoma is a secondary account appearing in the work of Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán in the 17th century, long after the event. After the conquest, the inhabitants of the eastern part of the kingdom were relocated by the conquerors to San Pedro Sacatepéquez, including some of the inhabitants of the archaeological site now known as Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo). The rest of the population of Mixco Viejo, together with the inhabitants of the western part of the kingdom, were moved to San Martín Jilotepeque. The Chajoma rebelled against the Spanish in 1526, fighting a battle at Ukub'il, an unidentified site <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> the modern towns of San Juan Sacatepéquez and San Pedro Sacatepéquez.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus' {{divisions}} met {{up to the}} north, and ravaged {{the countryside}} between the Ems and the Lippe, and penetrated to the Teutoburg Forest, a mountain forest in Western Germany situated between these two rivers. There, Germanicus {{and some of his}} men visited the site of the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, and began burying the remains of the Roman soldiers that had been left in the open. After half a day of the work, he called off the burial of bones so that they could continue their war against the Germans. He made his way into the heartland of the Cherusci. At a location Tacitus calls the pontes longi ("long causeways"), in boggy lowlands <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> the Ems, Arminius' troops attacked the Romans. Arminius initially caught Germanicus' cavalry in a trap, inflicting minor casualties, but the Roman infantry reinforced the rout and checked them. The fighting lasted for two days, with neither side achieving a decisive victory. Germanicus' forces withdrew and returned to the Rhine.|$|E

5|$|Gil González Dávila set {{out from}} the Caribbean island of Hispaniola early in 1524, with the {{intention}} of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.|$|E
5|$|The richer {{lands of}} Mexico engaged the main {{attention}} of the Conquistadors for some years, then in 1526 Francisco de Montejo (a veteran of the Grijalva and Cortés expeditions) successfully petitioned the King of Spain {{for the right to}} conquer Yucatán. On 8 December of that year he was issued with the hereditary military title of adelantado and permission to colonise the Yucatán Peninsula. In 1527 he left Spain with 400 men in four ships, with horses, small arms, cannon and provisions. One of the ships was left at Santo Domingo as a supply ship to provide later support; the other ships set sail and reached Cozumel, an island off the east coast of Yucatán, {{in the second half of}} September 1527. Montejo was received in there in peace by the lord Aj Naum Pat. The ships only stopped briefly before making for the mainland, making landfall <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> Xelha in the Maya province of Ekab.|$|E

50|$|While some {{microbes}} may be purely mutualistic or parasitic, many may behave {{one way or}} {{the other}} depending on the host species with which it is associated, environmental conditions, and host health. A host’s immune response controls symbiont infection and growth rates. If a host’s immune response is not able to control a particular microbial species, or if host immunity is compromised, the microbe-plant relationship will likely reside <b>somewhere</b> <b>nearer</b> the parasitic side of the mutualist-parasite continuum. Similarly, high nutrients can push some microbes into parasitic behavior, encouraging unchecked growth at a time when symbionts are no longer needed to aid with nutrient acquisition.|$|R

5|$|Just {{before his}} {{creation}} as Caesar, Constantius proceeded to cut Carausius from his {{base of support}} in Gaul, recovering Boulogne after a hotly fought siege, a success {{that would result in}} Carausius being murdered and replaced by his aide Allectus, who would hold out in his Britain stronghold for a further three years until a two-pronged naval invasion resulted in Allectus' defeat and death at the hands of Constantius' pretorian prefect Julius Asclepiodotus, during a land battle <b>somewhere</b> <b>near</b> Farnham. Constantius himself, after disembarking in the south east, delivered London from a looting party of Frankish deserters in Allectus' pay, something that allowed him to assume the role of liberator of Britain. A famous commemorative medallion depicts a personification of London supplying the victorious Constantius on horseback. with the legend REDDITOR LUCIS AETERNAE (Restorer of the eternal light). The suppression of this threat to the Tetrarchs' legitimacy allowed both Constantius and Maximian to concentrate on outside threats: by 297 Constantius was back on the Rhine and Maximian engaged in a full-scale African campaign against Frankish pirates and nomads, eventually making a triumphal entry into Carthage on 10 March 298. However, Maximian's failure to deal with Carausius and Allectus on his own had jeopardized the position of Maxentius as putative heir to his father's post as Augustus of the West, with Constantius' son Constantine appearing as a rival claimant.|$|E

25|$|The main {{characteristic}} of the recent ITU CWDM standard is that the signals are not spaced appropriately for amplification by EDFAs.

40|$|The basic {{principle}} of astronomical interferometry is to derive the angular distribution of radiation {{in the sky}} from the Fourier transform of the electric field on the ground. What is so special about the Fourier transform? Nothing, it turns out. I consider the possibility of performing other transforms on the electric field with digital technology. The Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) is useful for interpreting observations of sources that {{are close to the}} interferometer (in the atmosphere for radio interferometers). Essentially, applying the FrFT focuses the array <b>somewhere</b> <b>nearer</b> than infinity. Combined with the other Linear Canonical Transforms, any homogeneous linear optical system with thin elements can be instantiated. The time variation of the electric field can also be decomposed into other bases besides the Fourier modes, which is especially useful for dispersed transients or quick pulses. I discuss why the Fourier basis is so commonly used, and suggest it is partly because most astrophysical sources vary slowly in time.
