Detail analyses of soil characteristics indicated significant heterogeneity with depth, especially between the surface soil and underlying soil at site. Decrease in potential adsorption sites with depth was observed in case of underlying soil. Reduced adsorption capacity for heavy metals was evidenced for underlying soil when compared with surface soil.

They are more like giant cracks in the ground than anything else.... But perhaps I had better begin by telling how we got there. We started about one in the morning ladened up with everything you can possibly imagine on a soldier, and in addition I had a kettle--filled with water--most of the chaps had bundles of firewood, and some had extra bread. We marched out of our quarters along the road for a mile or more, and then we took the fields, and presently came to a crest and dropped into a sort of maze of zigzag trenches going up to the front trench. These trenches, you know, are much deeper than one's height; you don't see anything. It's like walking along a mud-walled passage. You just trudge along them in single file. Every now and then some one stumbles into a <b>soakaway</b> for rainwater or swears at a soft place, or somebody blunders into the man in front of him. This seems to go on for hours and hours. It certainly went on for an hour; so I suppose we did two or three miles of it. At one place we crossed a dip in the ground and a ditch, and the trench was built up with sandbags up to the ditch and there was a plank. Overhead there were stars, and now and then a sort of blaze thing they send up lit up the edges of the trench and gave one a glimpse of a treetop or a factory roof far away. Then for a time it was more difficult to go on because you were blinded. Suddenly just when you were believing that this sort of trudge was going on forever, we were in the support trenches behind the firing line, and found the men we were relieving ready to come back.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Groundwater levels {{rises and}} falls in {{response}} to different phenomena such as seasonal fluctuations, and rainfall variability occasioned by global warming. These fluctuations are attributed to naturally occurring changes in climate and anthropogenic activities like changes in landscape, pumpage, induced infiltration, evapotranspiration, precipitation, temperature and pressure. The aim {{of this research was}} to assess the influence of aquifer depth on microbial parameters of borehole water. The aquifer depth was determined using seismic refraction method and the water samples were collected in a polyethylene container and preserved in an ice-packed box. It was immediately transferred to the laboratory for microbial analysis. It is believed that the deeper the depth of borehole the better the quality of water abstracted from it but {{this was not the case}} in the study area. Results show that even at the deepest depth of 50 m, microbial parameters such as faecal and total coliform were still found because most of the boreholes were located close to pit latrines and <b>soakaways.</b> This scenario encourages the seepage of micro organisms through the soil strata from the pit latrines into the borehole. The multiple regression analysis shows that R 2 is 0. 650. This implies that 65 percent of the variation in aquifer depth was explained by microbial parameter of borehole water in the study area. The researchers therefore recommended that boreholes should be sited far away from <b>soakaways</b> and pit latrine, furthermore a depth of atleast 70 m is appropriate for sinking of boreholes within the study area...|$|R

A key sustainable drainage technique is infiltration to the ground; these systems utilise the storage capacity of the subsurface to attenuate rainfall and include, for example, <b>soakaways,</b> infiltration basins, infiltration trenches and free-draining permeable pavements (Figure 1).

50|$|Any {{sheet of}} {{material}} {{used to cover}} a flat or low-pitched roof is usually known as a membrane and {{the primary purpose of}} these membranes is to waterproof the roof area. Materials that cover flat roofs typically allow the water to run off from a slight inclination or camber into a gutter system. Water from some flat roofs such as on garden sheds sometimes flows freely off the edge of a roof, though gutter systems are of advantage in keeping both walls and foundations dry. Gutters on smaller roofs often lead water directly onto the ground, or better, into a specially made <b>soakaway.</b> Gutters on larger roofs usually lead water into the rainwater drainage system of any built up area.

Six upscaling methods to aggregate individual <b>soakaway</b> units with varying saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) in the surrounding soil have been investigated. In the upscaled model, the weighted geometric mean hydraulic conductivity of individual allotments is found to provide the best match to an individual allotment model when comparing total outflow volume and peak flow rate.

This approach contrasts with methods based on traditional civil engineering judgement linked to standard variables based on community and environment studies. For a case study area (Greater Manchester), a comparison with the traditional approach of determining community and environment variables indicates that permeable pavements, filter strips, swales, ponds, constructed wetlands and below-ground storage tanks are generally less preferred than infiltration trenches, <b>soakaways</b> and infiltration basins. However, permeable pavements and belowground storage tanks also received relatively high scores, because of their great potential impact in terms of water quality improvement and flood control, respectively.

40|$|The ‘National Standards for Sustainable Drainage’ {{have been}} {{released}} by DEFRA for consultation {{and are expected to}} be implemented in October 2012. They specify guidelines for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), a term which encompasses a number of surface water management techniques, which are distinguished in the National Standards by the surface water runoff destination. Two such techniques are discharge to the ground (<b>soakaways,</b> infiltration basins, permeable pavements) and discharge to watercourses (detention basins and ponds). The National Standards require that a hierarchical approach to SuDS selection is adopted, with discharge to the ground being prioritised over discharge to surface water bodies, sewers and combined sewers respectively. The prioritisation of infiltration is consistent with current building regulations (Approved Document H) and is often a cost effective means to reduce off-site surface water flow rates to required greenfield rates. The feasibility of implementing infiltration SuDS is however highly dependent on the design of the system and on the compatibility of that design with the geological and hydrogeological properties of the subsurface...|$|R

40|$|Current UK {{guidance}} {{for the design}} of sustainable drainage systems recommends that infiltration devices, such as <b>soakaways,</b> permeable pavements and infiltration basins, should be able to operate during periods of extreme groundwater level. Furthermore, higher groundwater levels have recently been shown to cause a reduction in the empirical soil infiltration coefficient, as used in the design of infiltration devices. However, there is currently no simple method available to estimate the required reduction in the design infiltration coefficient to account for an extreme groundwater level. This paper uses exploratory numerical sub-surface saturated-unsaturated hydrological modelling to quantify the effect of groundwater level on the infiltration coefficient for six typical soil types. The fixed resolution finite element simulations are also benchmarked against a solution employing adaptive mesh refinement. The modelling results are distilled into charts and a simple equation to allow the calculation of adjustment factors, with which to reduce the design infiltration coefficient to account for a higher design groundwater level. Varying soil type sensitivity is highlighted. These factors could also be used to correct for soakage tests made during periods of lower groundwater level.
