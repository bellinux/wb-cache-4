25|$|In 1809, Louis Poinsot rediscovered Kepler's figures, by {{assembling}} star pentagons {{around each}} vertex. He also assembled convex polygons around star vertices to discover two more regular stars, the great icosahedron and great dodecahedron. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>call</b> these two the Poinsot polyhedra. Poinsot {{did not know}} if he had discovered all the regular star polyhedra.|$|E
25|$|As this prudent economy, which <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>call</b> Saving, is {{in private}} {{families}} the most certain method to increase an estate, so some imagine that, whether a country be barren or fruitful, the same method if generally pursued (which they think practicable) {{will have the}} same effect upon a whole nation, and that, for example, the English might be much richer than they are, if they would be as frugal as some of their neighbours. This, I think, is an error.|$|E
25|$|String bands provide {{elaborate}} performances. Limited to unamplified strings, reeds, and percussion, string bands feature banjos, saxophones (alto, tenor, baritone and bass), accordions, double basses, drums, glockenspiels and violins {{in musical}} arrangements {{tied to a}} theme presented by the captain, beautiful costumes and props (<b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>call</b> them floats). Historically, string bands performed mostly in military-drill formations. Harrowgate (now Uptown) String Band's first-prize-winning railroad tunes with Broadway-style dance in 1976 changed that. String-band performances are now the most elaborate of the parade, outdone only by the fancy brigades indoor performance.|$|E

25|$|William Ruddiman has {{proposed}} the early anthropocene hypothesis, {{according to which}} the anthropocene era, as <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>call</b> the most recent period in the earth's history when {{the activities of the}} human species first began to have a significant global impact on the earth's climate and ecosystems, did not begin in the 18th century {{with the advent of the}} Industrial Era, but dates back to 8,000 years ago, due to intense farming activities of our early agrarian ancestors. It was at that time that atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations stopped following the periodic pattern of the Milankovitch cycles. In his overdue-glaciation hypothesis Ruddiman states that an incipient glacial would probably have begun several thousand years ago, but the arrival of that scheduled glacial was forestalled by the activities of early farmers.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>call</b> stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E
500|$|..... And when Michel {{gets his}} strokes of genius and, {{in the video}} for [...] "Army of Me", wants a dentist that's a gorilla to find a diamond in my mouth, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>call</b> it nonsense. But it's {{probably}} the most realistic way of expressing what situation I'm in - all these people trying to take things away from me, and the gorilla finding a diamond that I don't know I have and then stealing it. [...] "Army of Me" [...] is so much about me actually learning that I have to defend myself. I {{have to stand up}} and fight the fucking gorilla. Once I've got the diamond and I run away with it, it becomes massive 'cos it's mine. But if the gorilla had kept it, it would have gone really tiny. That's surrealism for me.|$|E

25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> (<b>called</b> anonyms) {{choose to}} be anonymous, that is, to hide their true names, for fear of {{governmental}} prosecution or social ridicule of their works or actions. Another method to disguise one's identity is to employ a pseudonym.|$|R
2500|$|Aristide later {{repeated}} similar claims, in {{an interview}} with Amy Goodman of Democracy Now! on 16 March. Goodman asked Aristide if he resigned, and President Aristide replied: [...] "No, I didn't resign.

2500|$|Composting toilets {{can be used}} to {{implement}} an ecological sanitation approach for resource recovery, and <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>call</b> their composting toilet designs [...] "ecosan toilets" [...] for that reason. However, this is not recommended as the two terms (i.e. composting and ecosan) are not identical.|$|E
2500|$|Pyramid schemes however [...] "may {{purport to}} sell a product, but they often simply use the product to hide their pyramid structure". While <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>call</b> MLMs in general [...] "pyramid selling", others use the term to denote an illegal pyramid scheme {{masquerading}} as an MLM.|$|E

25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>called</b> Palmerston a womaniser; The Times {{named him}} Lord Cupid (on {{account of his}} {{youthful}} looks), and he was cited, {{at the age of}} 79, as co-respondent in an 1863 divorce case, although it emerged that the case was nothing more than an attempted blackmail.|$|R

[...] The {{providence}} of God so ordering {{and directing}} it; for {{though it was}} hap and chance to her, and what <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>call</b> good luck, it was according to the purpose, and by the providence and direction of God that {{she came to the}} reapers {{in that part of the}} field Boaz.|$|E
2500|$|A {{player who}} bowls a strike in the tenth (final) frame is awarded two extra balls {{so as to}} allow the {{awarding}} of bonus pins. If both these balls also result in strikes, a total of 30 pins (10 + 10 + 10) is awarded for the frame. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>call</b> it [...] "striking out", since three strikes in baseball equals an out.|$|E
5000|$|When Francisco Franco died in 1975, {{censorship}} {{began to}} disappear. This {{led to a}} growth of erotic comedies on Spanish cinema. Landa became the [...] "sexually repressed" [...] role of that trend, especially under directors Mariano Ozores and Pedro Lazaga. He even created his own trend, that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>called</b> landismo.|$|R

5000|$|A popular {{variation}} of tokneneng is kwek kwek. The main {{difference between the}} two lies in the egg that is used. Kwek kwek is traditionally made with quail eggs, while Tokneneng is made with chicken eggs. Due to their similarities, the two are often confused with <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>calling</b> tokneneng [...] "kwek kwek" [...] and vice versa.|$|R
2500|$|In A Charlie Brown Christmas, Charlie Brown's sister Sally {{writes to}} Santa and asks, [...] "How is your wife?" [...] Later, in It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown, she writes Santa's wife herself, and, when Charlie Brown {{comments}} that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>call</b> her [...] "Mary Christmas," [...] Sally congratulates her on choosing {{to keep her}} own surname. In Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales, Sally writes Santa Claus as [...] "Samantha Claus", inadvertently thinking Samantha Claus is Santa Claus's wife.|$|E
2500|$|Cuts: Cuts {{are very}} briefly lifting a finger above the note being sounded without {{interrupting}} airflow into the whistle. For example, a player playing a low D on a D whistle can cut the note by very briefly lifting the first finger {{of his or}} her lower hand. This causes the pitch to briefly shift upward. The cut can be performed either at the very start of the note or after the note has begun to sound; <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>call</b> the latter a [...] "double cut" [...] or a [...] "mid-note cut." ...|$|E
2500|$|Byzantium is a {{term used}} by modern historians {{to refer to the}} later Roman Empire. In its own time, the Empire ruled from Constantinople (or [...] "New Rome" [...] as <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>call</b> it, {{although}} this was a laudatory expression that was never an official title) was considered simply as [...] "the Roman Empire." [...] The fall of Constantinople led competing factions to lay claim to being the inheritors of the Imperial mantle. Russian claims to Byzantine heritage clashed with those of the Ottoman Empire's own claim. In Mehmed's view, he was the successor to the Roman Emperor, declaring himself Kayser-i Rum, literally [...] "Caesar of Rome", that is, of the Roman Empire, though he was remembered as [...] "the Conqueror". [...] He founded a political system that survived until 1922 with the establishment of the Republic of Turkey.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} many studies {{highlighting}} the development of language in twins compared to single-born children. These studies have converged {{on the notion that}} there is a greater rate of delay in language development in twins compared to their single-born counterparts. [...] The reasons for this phenomenon are still in question; however, cryptophasia was thought to be the major cause. [...] Idioglossia is defined as a private language that is usually invented by young children, specifically twins. Another term to describe what <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>call</b> [...] "twin talk" [...] is cryptophasia where a language is developed by twins that only they can understand. [...] The increased focused communication between two twins may isolate them from the social environment surrounding them. [...] Idioglossia {{has been found to be}} a rare occurrence and the attention of scientists has shifted away from this idea. [...] However, there are researchers and scientists that say cryptophasia or idioglossia is not a rare phenomenon. Current research is looking into the impacts of a richer social environment for these twins to stimulate their development of language.|$|E

60|$|And perhaps Captain Littlehales is right? It {{may be that}} I am mistaken in my {{appreciation}} of circumstances and possibilities in this case--or in any such case.
