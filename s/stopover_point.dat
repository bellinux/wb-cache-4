5|$|One of Loring's major {{secondary}} missions included {{serving as}} the headquarters for the 45th Air Division from 8 October 1954 to 18 January 1958, and on 20 November 1958. The host wing at Loring was the 42d Bombardment Wing for all but {{a small portion of}} its early existence. Loring was primarily home to active duty units, although this changed in the 1980s, when the Massachusetts Air National Guard's 101st Fighter Squadron sent a detachment to Loring. As the base was the closest in the U.S. to Europe, it also functioned as an important <b>stopover</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

25|$|The species shows two weight peaks each year: one at {{the start}} of the {{breeding}} season, and a higher one shortly before it begins its migration south in the autumn. Its lowest weights are typically recorded during the breeding season, when it also begins a complete molt of its plumage. The chimney swift's weight gain before migration is smaller than that of some passerines, suggesting that it must refuel en route at various <b>stopover</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
50|$|In some migrant birds it {{is known}} that the initial {{direction}} of the migration is set by fairly simple hereditary mechanisms. Offspring of pairs comprising birds of different subpopulations will, in such species, attempt to migrate into an intermediate direction. Such a course would lead a Swainson's warbler deep into the Caribbean where there are no wintering or even <b>stopover</b> <b>points,</b> and the bird would almost certainly perish. More research such as analyzing bird banding data is needed to determine whether this mechanism applies in Swainson's warbler.|$|R

50|$|The bleak Sierra Morena {{mountains}} {{were also}} notorious in former times {{for being a}} haunt of bandits and highwaymen. The Nuevas Poblaciones de Andalucía y Sierra Morena administrative division was started in 1767 {{during the reign of}} Charles III of Spain in order to populate the mountainous zone. As a consequence the area around La Carolina was settled with farmers that included German, Swiss and Flemish families. One of the goals of the project was to have safe <b>stopover</b> <b>points</b> for carriages in the desolate region that would be within reasonable distance from each other.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is marked}} {{by more than a}} hundred small, rocky islands, which serve as <b>stopover</b> <b>points</b> during the migrations of a number of bird species, {{including}} flamingos, pelicans, spoonbills, ibises, storks, shelducks, avocets, stilts, and gulls. A recent drought has significantly decreased the annual amount of water the lake receives. This in turn has increased the salinity of the lake's water, reducing its viability as home to thousands of migratory birds, including a large flamingo populations. The salinity has particularly increased in the half of the lake north of the Urmia Lake Bridge.|$|R
5000|$|Oak Orchard Creek rises {{south of}} Oak Orchard Creek Marsh (also called the [...] "Alabama Swamp") {{at the border}} of Orleans and Genesee counties.

Oak Orchard Creek Marsh was designated a National Natural Landmark in May 1973. [...] The swamp is a result of a partial blockage of the river by glacial drift and an outcrop of limestone and dolostone known as the Lockport Formation which forms the Niagara Escarpment.|$|R
25|$|During {{the first}} year of the Civil War, the {{southern}} ports in the Gulf of Mexico experienced a great deal of blockade-running activity. In the first ten months, New Orleans, Louisiana, the largest cotton port in the world, gave port to more than 300 blockade runners. When New Orleans fell to Union forces on April 25, 1862, the center for blockade-running activity shifted to Mobile, Alabama. With New Orleans and the Mississippi River secured, blockade efforts by the Union Navy along the Gulf coast were greatly increased, forcing blockade runners to use the port at Galveston, Texas. When Mobile and its port came under siege in the summer of 1864, all activity there moved to Galveston. Blockade runners used Havana as a <b>stopover</b> <b>point,</b> for transferring cargoes to and from neutral ships.|$|E
25|$|Hula Lake Park, {{known in}} Hebrew as Agamon HaHula, {{is located in}} the {{southern}} part of the Hula Valley, north of the nature reserve. It was established as part of a JNF rehabilitation project. In the early 1990s part of the valley was flooded again in the wake of heavy rains. It was decided to develop the surrounding area and leave the flooded area intact. The new site has become the second home for thousands of migrating birds in the autumn and spring. The lake covers an area of one square kilometer, interspersed with islands that serve as protected bird nesting sites. It has become a major stopover for migrating birds flying from Europe to Africa and back, and also a major birdwatching site. In 2011, Israeli ornithologists confirmed that Lake Hula is the <b>stopover</b> <b>point</b> for tens of thousands of cranes migrating from Finland to Ethiopia every winter. In Israel, farmers set out food for them to keep them from damaging crops near the lake.|$|E
25|$|On Woodlark, the {{construction}} of Woodlark Airfield was begun by 20th and 60th US Naval Construction Battalions on 2 July and by 14 July the airfield consisted of single 3,000 feet (910 m) x 150 feet (46 m) runway which could accommodate Douglas C-47 Skytrains. By 21 July the runway was expanded to 5,200 feet (1584 m) of runway and a coral surface with the 67th Fighter Squadron arriving on 23 July. The airfield was ultimately extended to 6,500 feet (2,000 m) x 225 feet (69 m) with a parallel runway of 6,000 feet (1,800 m) x 60 feet (18 m) together with 110 hardstands. The airfield {{was used as a}} <b>stopover</b> <b>point</b> and refuelling point. Defensive positions were set up around Woodlark with antiaircraft and coast artillery pieces of the 12th Defense Battalion being installed, and machine gun and 37mm beach positions established. A PT boat and landing craft repair base was also constructed at Guasopa Bay and the island was also used as a supply base.|$|E
5|$|Hunting along {{migration}} routes threatens some bird species. The {{populations of}} Siberian cranes (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) that wintered in India declined due to hunting along the route, particularly in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Birds were last seen in their favourite wintering grounds in Keoladeo National Park in 2002. Structures such as power lines, wind farms and offshore oil-rigs {{have also been}} known to affect migratory birds. Other migration hazards include pollution, storms, wildfires, and habitat destruction along migration routes, denying migrants food at <b>stopover</b> <b>points.</b> For example, in the East Asian–Australasian Flyway, up to 65% of key intertidal habitat at the Yellow Sea migration bottleneck has been destroyed since the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The main use of GTRs is to {{increase}} production of waterfowl. This {{is especially true in}} the southeastern United States, where the Mississippi Flyway encourages duck hunting. Waterfowl that use the Mississippi Flyway include American black duck (Anas rupribes), blue-winged teal (Anas discors), green-winged teal (Anas crecca), gadwall (Anas strepera), northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), northern pintail (Anas acuta), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), wood duck (Aix sponsa), and many others. Migrating waterfowl have high energy needs and require <b>stopover</b> <b>points</b> on their migration route (Martin and Finch 1995). With much of the bottomland hardwood forest in the southeast US destroyed, GTRs provide food and habitat for waterfowl during migration.|$|R
2500|$|On April 11, 1862, George W.

Nassau was one of several off shore <b>stopover</b> <b>points</b> for shipments coming into or leaving the Confederate States. [...] Maffitt's duties were broad. [...] "You are authorized to take entire control of all vessels loaded with arms and munitions for the Confederate States." [...] Maffitt's duties included selecting ports of entry and discharging and replacing officers and crews as needed. His only condition was that he first confer with Louis Heylinger, Confederate agent in Nassau. Maffitt would later be given command of the CSS Albemarle.|$|R

50|$|The years {{following}} World War II brought many revolutionary {{new technologies to}} the navy, most notably the helicopter and the jet fighter, and with this a complete rethinking of its strategies and ships′ tasks. Although several of the latest Commencement Bay-class CVE were deployed as floating airfields during the Korean War, {{the main reasons for}} the development of the escort carrier had disappeared or could be dealt with better by newer weapons. The emergence of the helicopter meant that helicopter-deck equipped frigates could now take over the CVE's role in a convoy while also performing their own traditional role as submarine hunters. Ship-mounted guided missile launchers took over much of the aircraft protection role, and in-flight refueling abolished the need for floating <b>stopover</b> <b>points</b> for transport or patrol aircraft. As a result, after the Commencement Bay class, no new escort carriers were designed, and with every downsizing of the navy, the CVEs were the first to be mothballed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Radar {{ornithology}} {{using data}} from the NEXRAD weather radar system has given scientists new tools for studying bird migration in the United States. Unfortunately, the process of identifying echoes from birds in radar data still largely requires that trained technicians spend hours manually scouring radar scans. This paper provides some background for understanding biological echoes in NEXRAD data and then describes our initial investigations of the use of machine learning techniques to help automate the process of echo classification. Doppler data allows researchers to look at bird migration by examining large clusters of birds that could be observed approaching and descending at <b>stopover</b> <b>points</b> where they would rest until they began the next leg of their journey. One of the NEXRAD system’s greatest strengths has also been a significant obstacle for researchers studying bird migration: with 154 radar stations across the United States, each often producing hundreds of volume scans per day, the amount of data to sort through is staggering. The real problem is that classifying birds in radar scans currently requires a skilled technician who has been trained in visually identifying the tell-tale signs that distinguish biological echoes from non-biological echoes. Consequently, the task o...|$|R

40|$|We {{assessed}} the nutritional condition and established reference values for serum chemistry parameters {{in a long}} distance migrant bird of prey, the Swainson’s Hawk (Buteo swainsoni), wintering in central Argentina. We analyzed serum concentration of urea, uric acid, cholesterol, and triglycerides and assessed age and sex related differences in these parameters. A body condition index {{was obtained from the}} resultant residuals of the regression of body mass and a morphometric measure. No statistical differences were observed among sex and age groups for urea, uric acid and triglyceride serum concentration. However, cholesterol concentration differed among male and female hawks, which could be related to the gain of body mass in wintering grounds at differential rates. The mean values of the four parameters were in the range of those recorded in the Common Buzzard (Buteo buteo), indicating good nutritional condition of the population we studied. Forearm length was the morphometric variable that better correlated with body mass. The resultant body condition index was only correlated with triglyceride concentration, suggesting that this index could be valuable in future work dealing with the assessment of body fat storage in wintering and breeding hawks, as well as in <b>stopover</b> <b>points</b> on the migratory route.
