25|$|The {{story is}} told by two {{alternating}} first person narrators. One of them is Roy Hubert Straitley, a 65-year-old Classics master who has devoted all his life to St Oswald's and who now, {{nearing the end of}} his professional career, finds himself the last surviving member of the dying breed of classics teachers. The other narrator is the perpetrator, whose identity is only revealed in the final part of the book, and whose plotting the reader is able to follow first hand. Time and again, flashbacks detail the second narrator's childhood, adolescence and young adulthood, thus giving a fully rounded picture of a deranged mind and explaining why someone <b>should</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> demolish a school's reputation and do harm to members of the staff.|$|E
2500|$|Eliot once said, [...] "Well, {{this year}} I'm told the team did well because one pitcher {{had a fine}} curve ball. I {{understand}} that a curve ball is thrown with a deliberate attempt to deceive. Surely {{this is not an}} ability we <b>should</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> foster at Harvard." ...|$|E

But the directors of the Antoinette Company, having already spent a large sum of money upon the project, and having lost two machines, were not inclined to take the risk of a third venture, particularly as the great Reims flying meeting was now imminent and they desired to send all their available machines there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after being}} appointed, he {{outlined}} {{his views on}} social security: [...] "Every party <b>should</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see welfare spending come down. That should be an aspiration {{for all of us}} because what you're saying is we are working towards a society where there are fewer people caught in dependency, fewer people who are out of work and need that intervention from the state." [...] He also said: [...] "You have always got to handle issues of welfare with care because you are dealing with support mechanisms for Britain's most vulnerable people".|$|E
2500|$|The Bolshevik theorist {{appears to}} have incited the Transnistrians and Bessarabians to spread the flame of {{revolution}} into [...] "boyar Romania", to [...] "drown {{the hell out of}} the Romanian king and set up a Soviet Romania". Reportedly, Lenin also urged the Transnistrian delegate to personally to sabotage the war effort on the Caucasus Front, fraternize with the Ottomans and demand [...] "peace without annexations or indemnities". As some Romanian historians have noted, [...] "Lenin was not about to curb , but did not specify in sufficiently clear terms what would happen if they <b>should</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> achieve self-determination in any social order other than communism." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is {{disagreement}} in {{the literature}} regarding whether vos Savant's formulation of the problem, as presented in Parade magazine, is asking {{the first or second}} question, and whether this difference is significant (Rosenhouse 2009). Behrends (2008) concludes that [...] "One must consider the matter with care to see that both analyses are correct"; {{which is not to say}} that they are the same. One analysis for one question, another analysis for the other question. Several discussants of the paper by (Morgan et al. 1991), whose contributions were published alongside the original paper, strongly criticized the authors for altering vos Savant's wording and misinterpreting her intention (Rosenhouse 2009). One discussant (William Bell) considered it a matter of taste whether or not one explicitly mentions that (under the standard conditions), which door is opened by the host is independent of whether or not one <b>should</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> switch.|$|E

2500|$|The {{developers}} considered having GLaDOS and Chell act as [...] "buddy cops {{against a}} new threat", but felt that since Chell never talked, {{it would not}} work. He compared her transformation into a potato and having her power stripped away to the game Jenga: [...] "You’re taking stuff off the bottom and seeing what happens." [...] While {{she was in the}} potato form, the designers noticed a [...] "very stark difference between this imperious, all-powerful GLaDOS talking to you, and this powerless GLaDOS talking to you on your gun". They found that play testers were not interested in her when she was powerless and insulting players and would question why they were [...] "carting this person along". They decided to give her a personality shift and become Chell's [...] "sidekick" [...] on the basis that [...] "she can’t just be needling you for a half hour". In order to keep players from feeling that they <b>should</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> abandon GLaDOS in her powerless form to prevent her from becoming powerful again, the designers made sure to give players reason to bring her with them. In considering the interaction between Chell and GLaDOS, Erik Johnson compared GLaDOS to [...] "a jealous ex-girlfriend", noting [...] " [...] the only person she can have interaction with, but the problem is her only way of interacting with anyone is to test them". While they introduced new characters into the game, the focus of the story in Portal 2 remained the connection and interaction between Chell and GLaDOS, and focuses more on the fallout from Chell's destruction of GLaDOS from the first game.|$|E
