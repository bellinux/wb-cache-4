The {{value of the}} exciting frequency when the subharmonic resonance occurs is discussed. The influences of the time delay and the feedback gain on the system <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>response</b> are studied. The variation of the <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>response</b> with the system parameters is obtained. The {{results show that the}} value of the exciting frequency when the subharmonic resonance occurs is affected by the system parameters. The proportion of the one third harmonic in the amplitude increases rapidly with the increase of the exciting frequency. The variation of the amplitude ratio of the one third harmonic and the first harmonic is wavy type. The proportion of the one third harmonic in the amplitude decreases with increasing the displacement feedback gain and increases with increasing the velocity feedback gain. The proportion of the one third harmonic in the amplitude occupies a dominant position in the <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>response...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of primary, superharmonic of order five, and subharmonic of order one-three resonances for non-linear s. d. o. f. system with two distinct time-delays under an external excitation is investigated. The method of multiple scales {{is used to}} determine two first order ordinary differential equations which describe the modulation of the amplitudes and the phases. Steady-state solutions and their stabilities in each resonance are studied. Numerical results are obtained by using the Software of Mathematica, which presented {{in a group of}} figures. The effect of the feedback gains and time-delays on the non-linear response of the system is discussed and it is found that: an appropriate feedback can enhance the control performance. A suitable choice of the feedback gains and time-delays can enlarge the critical force amplitude, and reduce the peak amplitude of the response (or peak amplitude of the free oscillation term) for the case of primary resonance (superharmonic resonance). Furthermore, a proper feedback can eliminate saddle-node bifurcation, thereby eliminating jump and hysteresis phenomena taking place in the corresponding uncontrolled system. For subharmonic resonance, an adequate feedback can reduce the regions of <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>response...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{torsional}} vibration {{characteristics of a}} geared system with clearance are investigated in this study. The clearance results in a bilinear restoring force characteristic which is non-linear in nature. This particular type of non-linearity causes the generation of ultraharmonic, harmonic and <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonances.</b> Analytical solutions are derived for ultraharmonic, harmonic and <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonances</b> by {{the application of the}} Ritz averaging method with two or three term approximations for forcing functions of the type T cos (omega) t and C (omega) (2 ̆ 72) cos (omega) t. T and C are constants and (omega) is the forcing frequency. The accuracy of this approximate method is verified by means of analog computer simulation. The analytical solutions agree quite closely with analog computer results. The analytical solutions are also compared with experimental results obtained from a mechanical model with a bilinear restoring force characteristic. The mechanical model exhibits ultraharmonic and harmonic resonances, but fails to develop distinct <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonances</b> owing to inadequate power capacity of the vibrator system used. With the analog computer however, the <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> is excited over a limited frequency range. Although the experimental results are lower in magnitude than predicted, they distinctly show the nature of non-linear response.

This fact is demonstrated experimentally by exciting a jet at fundamental and subharmonic frequencies. The phase angle between the waves' stresses and strains was varied by varying the initial phase-difference between the two excitation waves.

In ideal case, {{this type of}} gyro should be insensitive {{to this kind of}} impact due to primary and secondary angular oscillations. However, experimental results reveal significant increase in output signal under external vibrations in 20 Hz - 2 kHz bandwidth, though the device natural frequencies are above 3 kHz. This effect is caused by characteristicsnonlinearity of plate-type and comb-type capacitive sensors. Method. Mathematical model of the capacitive comb-type sensors is clarified. Electromechanical interactions in the sensors under external vibrations are described. Simulink modeling of specified mathematical model is carried out.

The effect of various parameters on the response of the system is demonstrated using the amplitude-frequency curve. Order-two superharmonic resonance persists for the linear system. While the order-two subharmonic response level is dependent on the ratio of parametric excitation and damping, nonlinearity is essential for the order-two <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance.</b> Order-three resonances are present in the system as well and they {{are similar to those of}} the Duffing equation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} {{and development of}} large 2 D vortical disturbances (coherent structures) in forced transitional and turbulent wall jets is investigated using several numerical techniques. For the early and late transition stages, 2 D Numerical Simulation (2 D-NS) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) are employed, while for the forced turbulent flow Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) calculations are used including a new, simplified approach called "Stability" RANS (SRANS) which substantially reduces the computational effort when compared to URANS. As base flows for the investigations, three prototypical wall jets are considered: Low and high Reynolds number laminar wall jets, represented by the Glauert similarity solution, and a turbulent wall jet (Rej = 10, 000), modeled using a nearly self-preserving RANS solution starting at a virtual nozzle. The investigations of 2 D vortical disturbances in both the transitional and the turbulent wall jet follow the 2 D stages of shear flow transition, beginning with receptivity to harmonic forcing, followed by linear and nonlinear disturbance development, and 2 D secondary instability. It is shown that the disturbance development in the turbulent flow parallels {{the one in the}} transitional flow in many respects. In particular, a 2 D <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> is found in both flows leading to a <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> cascade with repeated vortex merging. Competing 3 D fundamental and <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonances</b> in the transitional wall jet are studied using a linearized Navier-Stokes code and 3 D DNS. These 3 D secondary instabilities weaken or diminish the 2 D disturbances and lead to turbulent breakdown. Yet, for large amplitude forcing, the 3 D resonances are surpassed by the 2 D <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> which leads to vortex merging upstream of the breakdown. With a 3 D DNS of bypass transition, where a high Reynolds number laminar wall jet is tripped with large amplitude 3 D forcing, it is demonstrated that 2 D vortical structures persist in the presence of 3 D turbulent fluctuations. In this simulation, 2 D vortical structures emerge during transition and undergo repeated merging in the turbulent flow downstream...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} spin dynamics of a single electron confined in a quantum dot. Spin dynamics is induced by the interplay of electrical driving {{and the presence of}} a spatially disordered magnetic field, the latter being transverse to a homogeneous magnetic field. We focus on the case of strong driving, i. e., when the oscillation amplitude $A$ of the electron's wave packet is comparable to the quantum dot length $L$. We show that electrically driven spin resonance can be induced in this system by subharmonic driving, i. e., if the excitation frequency is an integer fraction (1 / 2, 1 / 3, etc) of the Larmor frequency. At strong driving we find that (i) the Rabi frequencies at the <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonances</b> are comparable to the Rabi frequency at the fundamental resonance, and (ii) at each <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance,</b> the Rabi frequency can be maximized by setting the drive strength to an optimal, finite value.

40|$|Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are {{performed}} to investigate laminar-turbulent transition in a boundary {{layer on a}} sharp cone at Mach 6. The main objective of this dissertation research is to explore which nonlinear breakdown mechanisms may be dominant in a broad [...] band "natural" disturbance environment and then use this knowledge to perform controlled transition simulations to investigate these mechanisms in great detail. Towards this end, a "natural" transition scenario was modeled and investigated by generating wave packet disturbances. The evolution of a three-dimensional wave packet in a boundary layer has typically been used as an idealized model for "natural" transition to turbulence, since it represents the impulse response of the boundary layer and, thus, includes the interactions between all frequencies and wave numbers. These wave packet simulations provided strong evidence for a possible presence of fundamental and <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> mechanisms in the nonlinear transition regime. However, the fundamental resonance was much stronger than the subharmonic. In addition to these two resonance mechanisms, the wave packet simulations also indicated the possible presence of oblique breakdown mechanism. To gain more insight into the nonlinear mechanisms, controlled transition simulations were performed of these mechanisms. Several small and medium scale simulations were performed to scan the parameter space for fundamental and <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance.</b> These simulations confirmed {{the findings of the}} wave packet simulations, namely that, fundamental resonance is much stronger compared to the <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance.</b> Subsequently a set of highly resolved fundamental and oblique breakdown simulations were performed.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} transition {{regime of}} supersonic boundary layers at low to moderate supersonic Mach numbers (Mach 2 - 3 : 5) under wind-tunnel conditions is studied using linear stability theory (LST) and direct numerical simulations (DNS). Two main flow configurations are chosen, a flat-plate boundary layer and a cone boundary layer. Previous {{investigations of the}} early nonlinear transition regime have mainly focused on two nonlinear mechanisms, the so-called "oblique breakdown" mechanism and "asymmetric subharmonic resonance". The first mechanism has only been investigated numerically while the second mechanism was first observed in experiments. This dissertation discusses three open questions related to both mechanisms: (i) Can oblique breakdown be identified in old wind-tunnel experiments published in the literature, (ii) {{what is the most}} dominant breakdown mechanism for a supersonic boundary layer, oblique breakdown or asymmetric <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance,</b> and (iii) does oblique breakdown lead to a fully developed turbulent boundary layer? By adopting the flow conditions and the disturbance generation of a specific experiment from the literature, in which asymmetric <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> in a wave train was studied, it was possible to show that oblique breakdown might also have been present in the experiment, although oblique breakdown was not reported by the experimentalists. Hence, this experiment might provide the first experimental evidence of oblique breakdown for a supersonic boundary layer. The second question was addressed by performing DNS of a wave packet. A wave packet is typically used as a model of a broadband disturbance environment. If a nonlinear mechanism is dominant, it should leave strong imprints in the disturbance spectrum of the wave packet. In the DNS of the wave packet, oblique breakdown was visible in the disturbance spectrum while <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> played only a minor role.

The shallow arch is simply supported at both ends and is subjected to periodic lateral force. Equations of motion are reduced to ordinary differential equations of multiple-degree-of-freedom system by the Galerkin procedure. To clarify effects of sag-to-span ratio on chaotic motions, first, steady-state responses are calculated by the harmonic balance method. The chaotic responses are obtained by numerical integration and are examined by Poincare projection, the maximum Lyapunov exponent and bifurcation diagrams. For the arch with comparatively small sag-to-span ratio, chaotic vibrations are generated mainly in the regions of <b>subharmonic</b> <b>resonance</b> of 1 / 3 order and of ultra-subharmonic resonance of 3 / 2 order, accompanied by the lowest-symmetric-mode of vibration.
