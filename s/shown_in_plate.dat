60|$|Nor, observe, do I {{insist upon}} this {{quantity}} merely as arithmetical, {{or as if}} it were producible by repetition of similar things. It would be easy to be redundant, if multiplication of the same idea constituted fulness; and since Turner first introduced these types of landscape, myriads of vulgar imitations of them have been produced, whose perpetrators have supposed themselves disciples or rivals of Turner, in covering their hills with white dots for forest, and their foregrounds with yellow sparklings for herbage. But the Turnerian redundance is never monotonous. Of the thousands of groups of touches which, with him, are necessary to constitute a single bank of hill, not one but has some special character, and is as much a separate invention as the whole plan of the picture. Perhaps this may be sufficiently understood by an attentive examination of the detail introduced by him in his St. Gothard subject, as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Plate</b> +37+.|$|E
60|$|The {{pattern in}} every {{distinct}} finger print, {{even though it}} be only a dabbed impression, contains on a rough average thirty-five different points of reference, {{in addition to its}} general peculiarities of outline and core. They consist of forkings, beginnings or ends of ridges, islands, and enclosures. These minute details are by no means peculiar to the pattern itself, but are distributed with almost equal abundance throughout the whole palmar surface. In order to make an exhaustive comparison of two impressions they ought to be photographically enlarged to a size not smaller than those <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Plate</b> 15. Two negatives of impressions can thus be taken side by side on an ordinary quarter-plate, and any number of photographic prints made from them; but, for still more comfortable working, a further enlargement is desirable, say by the prism, p. 52. Some of the prints may be made on ferro-prussiate paper, as already mentioned pp. 51, 53; they are more convenient by far than prints made by the silver or by the platinum process.|$|E

60|$|The most {{curious fact}} is the perfect {{gradation}} {{in the size of}} the beaks in the different species of Geospiza, from one as large as that of a hawfinch to that of a chaffinch, and (if Mr. Gould is right in including his sub-group, Certhidea, in the main group) even to that of a warbler. The largest beak in the genus Geospiza is <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> (<b>Plate</b> 81) Figure 1, and the smallest in Figure 3; but instead of there being only one intermediate species, with a beak of the size shown in Figure 2, there are no less than six species with insensibly graduated beaks. The beak of the sub-group Certhidea, is shown in Figure 4. The beak of Cactornis is somewhat like that of a starling, and that of the fourth sub-group, Camarhynchus, is slightly parrot-shaped. Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends. In a like manner it might be fancied that a bird, originally a buzzard, had been induced here to undertake the office of the carrion-feeding Polybori of the American continent.|$|E
6000|$|... § XXV. Of the archivolts {{which these}} capitals {{generally}} sustain, details {{are given in}} the Appendix and in the notice of Venetian doors in Chapter VII. In the private palaces, the ranges of archivolt {{are for the most}} part very simple, with dentilled mouldings; and all the ornamental effect is entrusted to pieces of sculpture set in the wall above or between the arches, in the manner <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Plate</b> XV., below, Chapter VII. These pieces of sculpture are either crosses, upright oblongs, or circles: of all the three forms an example is given in Plate XI. opposite. The cross was apparently an invariable ornament, placed either in the centre of the archivolt of the doorway, or in the centre of the first story above the windows; on each side of it the circular and oblong ornaments were used in various alternation. In too many instances the wall marbles have been torn away from the earliest Byzantine palaces, so that the crosses are left on their archivolts only. The best examples of the cross set above the windows are found in houses of the transitional period: one in the Campo St^a M. Formosa; another, in which a cross is placed between every window, is still well preserved in the Campo St^a Maria Mater Domini; another, on the Grand Canal, in the parish of the Apostoli, has two crosses, one {{on each side of the}} first story, and a bas-relief of Christ enthroned in the centre; and finally, that from which the larger cross in the Plate was taken in the house once belonging to Marco Polo, at San Giovanni Grisostomo.|$|E
6000|$|... § 27. But {{this form}} is much {{modified}} {{by the special}} direction of the descending force as it escapes from confinement. For a stream coming down a ravine is kept by the steep sides of its channel in concentrated force: but it no sooner reaches the bottom, and escapes from its ravine, than it spreads in all directions, or at least tries to choose a new channel at every flood. Let a b c, Fig. 104, be three ridges of mountain. The two torrents coming down the ravine between them meet, at d and e, with the heaps of ground formerly thrown down by their own agency. These heaps being {{more or less in}} the form of cones, the torrent has a tendency to divide upon their apex, like water poured {{on the top of a}} sugar-loaf, and branch into the radiating channels e x, e y, &c. The stronger it is, the more it is disposed to rush straightforward, or with little curvature, as in the line e x, with the impetus it has received in coming down the ravine; the weaker it is, the more readily it will lean to one side or the other, and fall away in the lines of escape, e y, or e h; but of course at times of highest flood it fills all its possible channels, and invents a few new ones, of which afterwards the straightest will be kept by the main stream, and the lateral curves occupied by smaller branches; the whole system corresponding precisely to the action of the ribs of the young leaf, as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Plate</b> +8+ of Vol. III., especially in Fig. 6,--the main torrent, like the main rib, making the largest fortune, i. e. raising the highest heap of gravel and dust.|$|E

60|$|The pocket {{apparatus}} {{is similar}} to one originally made and used by Sir William J. Herschel (see Plate 3, Fig. 4, in which the roller and its bearings are drawn {{of the same size}} as those I use). A small cylinder of hard wood, or of brass tube, say 1-3/4 inch long, and 1/2 or 3/4 inch in diameter, has a pin firmly driven into each end to serve as an axle. A piece of tightly-fitting india-rubber tubing is drawn over the cylinder. The cylinder, thus coated with a soft smooth compressible material, turns on its axle in two brackets, each secured by screws, as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Plate</b> 2, Fig. 4, to a board (say 6 × 2-1/2 × 1/4 inch) that serves as handle. This makes a very fair and durable roller; it can be used in the heat and damp of the tropics, and is none the worse for a wetting, but {{it is by no means}} so good for delicate work as a cylinder covered with roller composition. These are not at all difficult to make; I have cast them for myself. The mould is a piece of brass tube, polished inside. A thick disc, with a central hole for the lower pin of the cylinder, fits smoothly into the lower end of the mould, and a ring with a thin bar across it, fits over the other end, the upper pin of the cylinder entering a hole in the middle of the bar; thus the cylinder is firmly held in the right position. After slightly oiling the inside of the mould, warming it, inserting the disc and cylinder, and fitting on the ring, the melted composition is poured in on either side of the bar. As it contracts on cooling, rather more must be poured in than at first appears necessary. Finally the roller is pushed out of the mould by a wooden ramrod, applied to the bottom of the disc. The composition must be melted like glue, in a vessel surrounded by hot water, which should never be allowed to boil; otherwise it will be spoilt. Harrild's best composition is more than twice the cost of that ordinarily used, and is expensive for large rollers, but for these miniature ones the cost is unimportant. The mould with which my first roller was made, was an old pewter squirt with the nozzle cut off; its piston served the double purpose of disc and ramrod.|$|E

30|$|The {{distribution}} of plasma pressure at auroral latitudes has been obtained by Wing and Newell (1998) and Wing et al. (2013), {{using data from}} Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites. Wing and Newell (1998) used the modified Tsyganenko- 1989 model to map the pressures from auroral latitudes into the equatorial plane. The plasma pressures in the plasma sheet at geocentric distances > 10 RE are <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Plate</b> 1 of Wing and Newell (1998) and are larger than 0.2 nPa. It {{is well known that}} the typical value of the Bx component of the magnetic field in the tail lobes is around 20 nT, which gives a corresponding pressure of 0.16 nPa. Considering the total pressure balance across the plasma sheet, the plasma pressure {{in the center of the}} sheet should have a similar value (see Petrukovich et al. 1999 and references therein). Wang et al. (2001) compared the radial profiles of plasma pressure near to midnight (see Fig.  4 in this paper), obtained using the data from several high-apogee satellites and by mapping the DMSP ion pressure from ionospheric altitudes onto the equatorial plane (see Figure 4 of Wang et al. 2001). They showed that the plasma pressure obtained by Wing and Newell (1998) by mapping DMSP ion pressure onto the equatorial plane from ionospheric altitudes is larger than that measured by Explorer 45, International Sun-Earth Explorer (ISEE) 1 and 2, and Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorers/Ion Release Module (AMPTE/IRM) satellites on the equatorial plane. Tsyganenko and Mukai (2003) show that the averaged value of ion pressure obtained in the plasma sheet using Geotail data is equal to 0.229 nPa. Comparison of this value of plasma pressure with the values of ion pressures <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Plate</b> 1 of Wing and Newell (1998) also indicate that under quiet geomagnetic conditions the ion pressure obtained using the DMSP data is larger than that obtained in the plasma sheet using Geotail data. Therefore, under quiet geomagnetic conditions, the auroral oval must be mapped closer to the Earth than is possible using the Tsyganenko- 1989 model. Recently, Wing et al. (2013) obtained the {{distribution of}} plasma pressure at the latitudes of the auroral oval for different phases of a magnetospheric substorm, using DMSP satellite data (see Plate 6 of Wing et al. 2013). In this, plasma pressures were found to range predominantly from 0.2 to 0.8 nPa. However, Wing et al. (2013) did not investigate the possible relationships between pressure distributions and different types of auroral electron precipitation.|$|E

Coolangatta to Lands End established the south- north limits. Beenleigh in Logan City was considered the half-way mark between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Just south of Beenleigh is the tiny town of Yatala, famous for its meat pies (the food of choice for Australians at sporting events or when travelling by car). Many a traveller to the Gold Coast stopped at Yatala to purchase the famous pies.

40|$|In the {{accompanying}} paper, {{it was necessary}} to align partial denaturation maps of linear but circularly permuted DNA molecules {{in order to determine the}} relative positions of the ends. As mentioned in Materials and Methods, this was accomplished by visual alignment of maps plotted on paper strips, a tedious process of possibly questionable objectivity. This Appendix describes a technique for the automated analysis by objective criteria of these maps, which yields essentially the same result with some improvement in the resolution of 6. ne structure. Each partially denatured P 22 DNA molecule is entered into a PDP 9 computer by tracing its electron micrograph on a Computek Tablet (model GT 50 / 10). Each molecule is divided into 1024 equal segments, each of which is coded to indicate whether it is in a native (level = 0) or denatured (level = 1) region. There are 1024 such segments per DNA molecule, so that each segment corresponds to about 40 base pairs.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to support, through the image <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Plate</b> K 1609, a {{possible}} iconographic story of a powerful myth of origin. The theory according to which the Maya kings used appellatives for their names that included concrete references to mythological scenes of gods to link themselves with the god mentioned in that specific mythical moment, and to make the achievements of the god during the chosen event something of their own, is maintained. Personal names are, no doubt, a major source of information of which there is still plenty of information to be obtained, which will be of help for a better understanding of the behaviour and personality of the rulers, in addition to the bonds they had with the gods included in those names. In this way, answers would derive for questions that still remain unanswered, such as: why were certain gods chosen to become a part of their personal names? What was it that they tried to transmit when they chose one or another aspect of the god? Do these names include places or mythological references?

40|$|The {{scanning}} electron microscopic {{studies of}} the clay minerals have usually been made on air-dried samples. The air-drying method is, however, not always preferable for H(2) O rich clay minerals such as imogolite because of their strong contraction in the dehydration process. The present writers examined the critical point drying for H(2) O rich clay mineral (imogolite) and proved that this drying method is excellent in preservation of natural surface of the minerals than that of air-drying. Imogolite which examined was separated from Kurayoshi pumice beds. The samples were treated first with OsO(4) solution and then were dehydrated progressively with ethanol. After completing above treatments, the imogolites which sealed in vessel were dried successively at critical point of CO(2).

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{investigation}} of eighteen Neomeris phocaenoides CUVIER which had beed caught in the coast of Tachibana Bay and landed at Nagasaki fish-market, the following characteristics have been ascertained. 1. The body color of this species is, in general, silver-grey, but is slightly light in its color in the part {{from the front of the}} larynx nearly to the anus. Their body color is usually changed to black, when it is made into sample by the fixation or left as it is. Therefore it has been mistakenly reported since olden time that the fresh body color of this species is black. 2. The head of this species is smaller than that of other species, with no snout. The forehead part and upper lip are similar to those of Globicephala melaena. And this whale has no dorsal fin but has a rising growing in wide line at the back, in exchange for the dorsal fin, and many little dots are found in that rising. The histological section of the rising, through the epidermal dot, is <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Plate</b> IN- 15. 3. The percentage of the fins to the body length in this species is larger than that of other species; and the posterior margin of the pectoral fin does not take the wave from. 4. In other kinds of the little toothed whales, the growth of body length is believed to be almost due to the growth of the tail part of such whales as Tursiops sp. and Pseudorca sp., but the growth of the body-length of this species is due to the growth of the abdominal part. 5. To speak of the skull of this species, the extreme rising at the fore part of the nares on os incisivum is characteristic, while os pterygoides, when viewed from the palate, is complicated. The skull measurement of this species are shown in Table 2. 6. The number of vertebra is shown in Table 3. Of the cervical vertebrae, 1 st. - 3 rd. adhere to all specimens. ﻿ 7. The number of os costale, two-headed os costale, and cartilago, and their connection to vertebrae and sternum are shown in Table 4 and Fig. 5. 8. The form of sternum is interesting to see. It is a short, wide and single bone, and does not consist of three bones, quite different from that of other kinds the of little toothed whales. 9. The scapula of this species has a characteristic form. It is considered generally that the scapula of the little toothed whales is characteristic in form according to their kinds. 10. The number and the form of teeth is shown in Table 5, Fig. 6 and Plate III- 10, 12. The form and arrangement of teeth in this species is very characteristic. 11. It seems that Neomeris phocaenoides is delivered of its cub in the coast of Nagasaki Prefecture between the last ten days of August and the first of September. This toothed whale takes the small sardin, small horse-mackerel, squid and other coastal little fishes, namely it has omnivorous nature. 12. In the case of male, there is no mammary slit on both side of the reproductive aperture, and there is a little cavity between the anus and reproductive aperture as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Plate</b> II- 8. This is the vestige of teat. 13. The authors regret that they can not find the values of this species caught in other sea areas, and confirmed by other authors in regard to the external proportions, the skull measurment, the number of vertebra, os costale, cartilago costale and the teeth, as there is scarcely any such trustworthy values of measurment to be relied upon. 1963 年 9 月・ 10 月,長崎県橘湾沿岸で捕獲され,長崎魚市に水揚げされたスナメリ(Neomeris phocaenoides CUVIER) の内 18 頭(雄 12 頭,雌 6 頭) について諸観察測定を行い,本種の特徴について検討した結果,次の事が明らかになった, 1. 本種の体色は,下吻下面より肛門附近までは幾分淡色をなしているが,大体に於て全身銀灰色である. 固定液で標本にした場合や,そのまゝ長く放置した場合には,普通体色は黒変する. 昔から本種の体色は黒色であると報ぜられているのは,この為であろう. 2. 本種の頭部は他に比べて非常に小さい. 又吻は突出していなくて前頭部及び上唇部はGlobicephala melaenaに良く似ている. 又本種には背鰭がない. その代りに背部に隆起部が巾広帯い状に発達していて,その隆起部には細い突起が多数存在している. その突起の部分を通る隆起部の組織学的な切片の状態はP 1. IV- 15 に示した. 3. 本種の鰭の体長比は他の種類の小型歯鯨よりも大きい. 特に胸鰭はその傾向が強い. 又胸鰭後縁は波状をなしていない. 4. 他の種類の小型歯鯨類ではその体長の成長は主としてその尾部による所が大であったが,本種に於ける体長の成長はその胴部の伸びが主として貢献している. これは本種が沿岸性の小型歯鯨である事を物語っていると思われる. 5. 本種の頭骨には切歯骨の鼻孔前方に存在する甚しい隆起が特徴的であり,その他形態上の特徴は口蓋面より見た翼状骨の形が複雑である等. 又本種の頭骨計測結果はTable 2 に示した. 6. 脊椎骨数の計測結果はTable 3 にかゝげた. 本種の頸椎骨は大体に於て最初の三つが癒着していた. 7. 肋骨・肋軟骨数及び夫等と脊椎骨・胸骨との結合状態等についてはTable 4,Fig. 5 に示した. 8. 本種の胸骨は非常に特徴ある形態をして居り,他の種類の小型歯鯨類の胸骨に於ける如く,胸骨柄・胸骨体・剣状突起の三つの骨から成立っていなくて単一骨である. その長さは短くて,巾広い. 9. 本種の肩甲骨は特徴ある形をしている. 肩甲骨は各種の小型歯鯨でその形態に良く特徴が出ていると思われる. 10. 本種の歯数はTable 5 に示した. 本種の歯の形及び歯の配列状態は特徴的である. 11. 本極は長崎県沿岸では 8 月下旬より 9 月初旬に分娩するものと思われる. 又本種は雑食性で沿岸の小型魚例えば小アジ・小イワシ及びイカ類を餌として摂取している様である. 12. 本種の雄には生殖孔の両側に乳溝はない. 又生殖孔と肛門の中間に一つの小盲嚢が存在している. これは退化乳頭であると考えられる. 13. 他に信頼出来る測定値が殆んどないので,体長プロポーション・頭骨計測・脊椎骨数・肋骨・肋軟骨・歯数・等他の海域産のものと比較出来ないのは残念であった...|$|E

[2003] raise {{several issues}} about our {{analysis}} of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for areas north of 30 #N between 1981 and 1999. As we describe below, their comments represent a basic misunderstanding of the data, a misrepresentation of our work, or an anticipation of our recently published results. Here we address these issues in {{order in which they}} are given by Lanfredi et al. 2. Areas Around Water Bodies Characterized by a Large Negative Trend [2] In section 2. 1 of Lanfredi et al. [2003] the authors confuse boundaries with NDVI values. This issue cannot be easily detected in the printed figures and does not affect our results.

This confusion partially results from the way that the two figures were plotted as contour maps. However, it can be visually exaggerated if the...|$|R
