60|$|Above these porphyries comes a coarse, {{arenaceous}} conglomerate, {{the lower}} half white and {{the upper half of}} a pink colour, composed chiefly of pebbles of various porphyries, but with some of red sandstone and jaspery rocks. In some of the more arenaceous parts of the conglomerate, there was an oblique or current lamination; a circumstance which I did not elsewhere observe. Above this conglomerate, there is a vast thickness of thinly stratified, pale-yellowish, <b>siliceous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> passing into a granular quartz-rock, used for grindstones (hence the name of the place Las Amolanas), and certainly belonging to the gypseous formation, as does probably the immediately underlying conglomerate. In this yellowish sandstone there are layers of white and pale-red siliceous conglomerate; other layers with small, well-rounded pebbles of white quartz, like the bed at the R. Claro at Coquimbo; others of a greenish, fine-grained, less siliceous stone, somewhat resembling the pseudo-honestones lower down the valley; and lastly, others of a black calcareous shale-rock. In one of the layers of conglomerate, there was embedded a fragment of mica-slate, of which this is the first instance; hence perhaps, it is from a formation of mica-slate, that the numerous small pebbles of quartz, both here and at Coquimbo, have been derived. Not only does the <b>siliceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> include layers of the black, thinly stratified, not fissile, calcareous shale-rock, but in one place the whole mass, especially the upper part, was, in a marvellously short horizontal distance, after frequent alternations, replaced by it. When this occurred, a mountain-mass, several thousand feet in thickness was thus composed; the black calcareous shale-rock, however, always included some layers of the pale-yellowish <b>siliceous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> of the red conglomerate, and of the greenish jaspery and pseudo-honestone varieties. It likewise included three or four widely separated layers of a brown limestone, abounding with shells immediately to be described. This pile of strata was in parts traversed by many veins of gypsum. The calcareous shale-rock, though when freshly broken quite black, weathers into an ash- colour: in which respect and in general appearance, it perfectly resembles those great fossiliferous beds of the Peuquenes range, alternating with gypsum and red sandstone, described in the last chapter.|$|E
60|$|The strata {{containing}} these remains are singular {{from the}} extreme variability of their mineralogical composition. Every intermediate form is present, between flinty-slate, clay-slate passing into grey wacke, pure limestone, sandstone, and porcellanic rock; {{and some of}} the beds {{can only be described as}} composed of a siliceo-calcareo-clay-slate. The formation, as far as I could judge, is at least a thousand feet in thickness: the upper few hundred feet usually consist of a <b>siliceous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> containing pebbles and no organic remains; the inferior strata, of which a pale flinty slate is perhaps the most abundant, are the most variable; and these chiefly abound with the remains. Between two beds of hard crystalline limestone, near Newtown, a layer of white soft calcareous matter is quarried, and is used for whitewashing houses. From information given to me by Mr. Frankland, the Surveyor-General, it appears that this Palaeozoic formation is found in different parts of the whole island; from the same authority, I may add, that on the north-eastern coast and in Bass' Straits primary rocks extensively occur.|$|E

60|$|To {{return to}} our section near Las Amolanas:--Above the yellow <b>siliceous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> or the {{equivalent}} calcareous slate-rock, with its bands of fossil-shells, according as the one or other prevails, there is a pile of strata, which cannot be less than from two to three thousand feet in thickness, in main part composed of a coarse, bright red conglomerate, with many intercalated beds of red sandstone, and some of green and other coloured porcelain-jaspery layers. The included pebbles are well-rounded, varying from {{the size of an}} egg to that of a cricket-ball, with a few larger; and they consist chiefly of porphyries. The basis of the conglomerate, {{as well as some of}} the alternating thin beds, are formed of a red, rather harsh, easily fusible sandstone, with crystalline calcareous particles. This whole great pile is remarkable from the thousands of huge, embedded, silicified trunks of trees, one of which was eight feet long, and another eighteen feet in circumference: how marvellous it is, that every vessel in so thick a mass of wood should have been converted into silex! I brought home many specimens, and all of them, according to Mr. R. Brown, present a coniferous structure.|$|E
60|$|The {{conglomerate}} is {{of great}} thickness: I do not suppose that the strata forming the separate mountain-masses [V,V,V] have ever been prolonged over each other, but that one mass has been broken up by several, distinct, parallel, uniclinal lines of elevation. Judging therefore of {{the thickness of the}} conglomerate, as seen in the separate mountain-masses, I estimated it at least from one thousand five hundred to two thousand feet. The lower beds rest conformably on some singularly coloured, soft strata [W], which I could not reach to examine; and these again rest conformably on a thick mass of micaceous, thinly laminated, <b>siliceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> [X], associated with a little black clay-slate. These lower beds are traversed by several dikes of decomposing porphyry. The laminated sandstone is directly superimposed on the vast masses of granite [Y,Y] which mainly compose the Portillo range. The line of junction between this latter rock, which is of a bright red colour, and the whitish sandstone was beautifully distinct; the sandstone being penetrated by numerous, great, tortuous dikes branching from the granite, and having been converted into a granular quartz rock (singularly like that of the Falkland Islands), containing specks of an ochrey powder, and black crystalline atoms, apparently of imperfect mica. The quartzose strata in one spot were folded into a regular dome.|$|E
60|$|Above {{this great}} conglomerate, {{we have from}} two to three hundred feet in {{thickness}} of red sandstone; and above this, a stratum of black calcareous slate-rock, like that which alternates with and replaces the underlying yellowish-white, <b>siliceous</b> <b>sandstone.</b> Close to the junction between this upper black slate-rock and the upper red sandstone, I found the Gryphaea Darwinii, the Turritella Andii, and vast numbers of a bivalve, too imperfect to be recognised. Hence we see that, {{as far as the}} evidence of these two shells serves--and the Turritella is an eminently characteristic species--the whole thickness of this vast pile of strata belongs to the same age. Again, above the last-mentioned upper red sandstone, there were several alternations of the black, calcareous slate-rock; but I was unable to ascend to them. All these uppermost strata, like the lower ones, vary extremely in character in short horizontal distances. The gypseous formation, as here seen, has a coarser, more mechanical texture, and contains much more siliceous matter than the corresponding beds lower down the valley. Its total thickness, together with the upper beds of the porphyritic conglomerate, I estimated at least at 8,000 feet; and {{only a small portion of}} the porphyritic conglomerate, which on the eastern flank of the fourth axis of elevation appeared to be from fifteen hundred to two thousand feet thick, is here included. As corroborative of the great thickness of the gypseous formation, I may mention that in the Despoblado Valley (which branches from the main valley a little above the town of Copiapo) I found a corresponding pile of red and white sandstones, and of dark, calcareous, semi-jaspery mudstones, rising from a nearly level surface and thrown into an absolutely vertical position; so that, by pacing, I ascertained their thickness to be nearly two thousand seven hundred feet; taking this as a standard of comparison, I estimated the thickness of the strata ABOVE the porphyritic conglomerate at 7,000 feet.|$|E

40|$|Compaction of sediments {{is driven}} towards lower {{porosities}} and higher densities {{as a function}} of increasing stress and chemical reactions.

Chemical compaction is a function of thermodynamics and kinetics and silicate reactions are very slow and sensitive to temperature.

This is therefore a function of temperature and nearly independent of the stress. Quartz cementation is probably also important in the compaction of siliceous mudstones. The kinetics of carbonate precipitation is much faster and less dependent on temperature and probably more dependent on effective stress (pressure solution) and stylolite formation. Carbonate compaction is however poorly understood and the relation between stress and both mechanical and chemical compaction is difficult to model. Experimental compaction of artificial and natural samples provides valuable constraints on the mechanical compaction processes.

60|$|The fossils before enumerated, {{from the}} limestone-layers in the whitish <b>siliceous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> are now covered, on the least computation, by strata from 5,000 to 6,000 feet in thickness. Professor E. Forbes thinks that these shells {{probably}} lived {{at a depth}} of from about 30 to 40 fathoms, that is from 180 to 240 feet; anyhow, it is impossible that they could have lived at the depth of from 5,000 to 6,000 feet. Hence in this case, as in that of the Puente del Inca, we may safely conclude that {{the bottom of the sea}} on which the shells lived, subsided, so as to receive the superincumbent submarine strata: and this subsidence must have taken place during the existence of these shells; for, as I have shown, some of them occur high up as well as low down in the series. That the bottom of the sea subsided, is in harmony with the presence of the layers of coarse, well- rounded pebbles included throughout this whole pile of strata, as well as of the great upper mass of conglomerate from 2,000 to 3,000 feet thick; for coarse gravel could hardly have been formed or spread out at the profound depths indicated by the thickness of the strata. The subsidence, also, must have been slow to have allowed of this often-recurrent spreading out of the pebbles. Moreover, we shall presently see that the surfaces of some of the streams of porphyritic lava beneath the gypseous formation, are so highly amygdaloidal that it is scarcely possible to believe that they flowed under the vast pressure of a deep ocean. The conclusion of a great subsidence during the existence of these cretaceo-oolitic fossils, may, I believe, be extended to the district of Coquimbo, although owing to the fossiliferous beds there not being directly covered by the upper gypseous strata, which in the section north of the valley are about 6,000 feet in thickness, I did not there insist on this conclusion.|$|E
60|$|I will {{describe}} {{only one other}} section, namely, {{on the north side}} of the R. Claro, which is interesting from containing fossils: the strata are much dislocated by faults and dikes, and are inclined to the north, towards a mountain of andesite and porphyry, into which they appear to become almost blended. As the beds approach this mountain, their inclination increases up to an angle of 70 degrees, and in the upper part, the rocks become highly metamorphosed. The lowest bed visible in this section, is a purplish hard sandstone. Secondly, a bed two or three hundred feet thick, of a white <b>siliceous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> with a calcareous cement, containing seams of slaty sandstone, and of hard yellowish-brown (dolomitic?) limestone; numerous, well-rounded, little pebbles of quartz are included in the sandstone. Thirdly, a dark coloured limestone with some quartz pebbles, from fifty to sixty feet in thickness, containing numerous silicified shells, presently to be enumerated. Fourthly, very compact, calcareous, jaspery sandstone, passing into (fifthly) a great bed, several hundred feet thick, of conglomerate, composed of pebbles of white, red, and purple porphyries, of sandstone and quartz, cemented by calcareous matter. I observed that some of the finer parts of this conglomerate were much indurated within a foot of a dike eight feet in width, and were rendered of a paler colour with the calcareous matter segregated into white crystallised particles; some parts were stained green from the colouring matter of the dike. Sixthly, a thick mass, obscurely stratified, of a red sedimentary stone or sandstone, full of crystalline calcareous matter, imperfect crystals of oxide of iron, and I believe of feldspar, and therefore closely resembling some of the highly metamorphosed beds at Arqueros: this bed was capped by, and appeared to pass in its upper part into, rocks similarly coloured, containing calcareous matter, and abounding with minute crystals, mostly elongated and glassy, of reddish albite. Seventhly, a conformable stratum of fine reddish porphyry with large crystals of (albitic?) feldspar; probably a submarine lava. Eighthly, another conformable bed of green porphyry, with specks of green earth and cream-coloured crystals of feldspar. I believe that there are other superincumbent crystalline strata and submarine lavas, but I had not time to examine them.|$|E
60|$|This axis {{consists}} of a broad mountainous mass [O] of andesite, composed of albite, brown mica, and chlorite, passing into andesitic granite, with quartz: on its western side it has thrown off, at a considerable angle, a thick mass of stratified porphyries, including much epidote [NN], and remarkable only from being divided into very thin beds, as highly amygdaloidal on their surfaces as subaerial lava-streams are often vesicular. This porphyritic formation is conformably covered, as seen some way up the ravine of Jolquera, by a mere remnant of {{the lower part of}} the cretaceo-oolitic formation [MM], which in one part encases, as represented in the coloured section, the foot of the andesitic axis [L], of the already described fifth line, and in another part entirely conceals it: in this latter case, the gypseous or cretaceo-oolitic strata falsely appeared to dip under the porphyritic conglomerate of the fifth axis. The lowest bed of the gypseous formation, as seen here [M], is of yellowish <b>siliceous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> precisely like that of Amolanas, interlaced in parts with veins of gypsum, and including layers of the black, calcareous, non-fissile slate-rock: the Turritella Andii, Pecten Dufreynoyi, Terebratula aenigma, var., and some Gryphites were embedded in these layers. The sandstone varies in thickness from only twenty to eighty feet; and this variation is caused by the inequalities in the upper surface of an underlying stream of purple claystone porphyry. Hence the above fossils here lie at the very base of the gypseous or cretaceo-oolitic formation, and hence they were probably once covered up by strata about seven thousand feet in thickness: it is, however, possible, though from the nature of all the other sections in this district not probable, that the porphyritic claystone lava may in this case have invaded a higher level in the series. Above the sandstone there is a considerable mass of much indurated, purplish-black, calcareous claystone, allied in nature to the often-mentioned black calcareous slate- rock. Eastward of the broad andesitic axis of this sixth line, and penetrated by many dikes from it, there is a great formation [P] of mica-schist, with its usual variations, and passing in one part into a ferruginous quartz-rock. The folia are curved and highly inclined, generally dipping eastward. It is probable that this mica-schist is an old formation, connected with the granitic rocks and metamorphic schists near the coast; and that the one fragment of mica-slate, and the pebbles of quartz low down in the gypseous formation at Las Amolanas, have been derived from it. The mica-schist is succeeded by stratified porphyritic conglomerate [Q] of great thickness, dipping eastward with a high inclination: I have included this latter mountain-mass in the same anticlinal axis with the porphyritic streams [NN]; but I am far from sure that the two masses may not have been independently upheaved.|$|E

It was noted that there was an abundance of degraded illite in the clay fractions of the Yokita 2 ̆ 7 soil with some quartz and a few kaolin and diatom particles. The degraded paddy soils examined contain illite or degraded illite as a main clay mineral, having a little iron content, low cation-exchange capacity, and a small surface area.

40|$|Solutional landforms {{have been}} {{described}} for over one hundred years from limestone terrains and are termed karst. In many tropical regions landforms of similar morphology but on highly <b>siliceous</b> <b>sandstones</b> and quartzites have also recently been identified. The similarity of these features in morphology and in genetic solutional processes to those on limestone has prompted recent calls for these quartzose landforms to also be regarded as true karst. Although not unknown in temperate latitudes, these highly siliceous solutional landforms have been most commonly studied in present-day tropical regions, or areas {{believed to have been}} tropical in the recent past. This concentration of research in hot-wet areas, allied with the long held assertion of the insolubility of silica, especially quartz, led to a belief that tropical climatic conditions are necessary for karstic solution of these rocks. However, some of these quartzose solutional landforms are known in areas of temperate climate where there is little evidence for prior tropical climates. A comprehensive worldwide review of these landforms, and the processes involved in their formation, has not previously been conducted and forms the basis from which this study stems. The Sydney Basin in southeastern Australia has had a stable temperate climate for much of the Cainozoic with no evidence of tropical climate. The highly quartzose Permo-Triassic sandstones of this area have little carbonate, but nevertheless display a wide range of landforms morphologically similar to those both on limestones and also tropical quartzites. These include large bedrock towers, grikes, caves, smaller solution basins and runnels and even widespread silica speleothems. This study describes the morphology of this suite of landforms in detail, and provides a comparative analysis of these sandstone forms to those reported from quartzites of tropical areas and also their limestone analogues. Microscopic and chemical analyses are then utilised in examining the poorly understood natural processes responsible for their formation. The process of sandstone solutional weathering in the Sydney Basin is also compared with that reported from the tropics, demonstrating very little difference in either the form or magnitude of attack between these two climatically distinct regions.

British gritstone {{was used for}} millstones to mill flour, to grind wood into pulp for paper and for grindstones to sharpen blades. [...] "Grit" [...] is often applied to sandstones composed of angular sand grains. It may commonly contain small pebbles. [...] "Millstone Grit" [...] is an informal term for a succession of gritstones which {{are to be found}} in the Peak District and Pennines of northern England. These sediments were laid down in the late (upper) Paleozoic era, in the Carboniferous period, in deltaic conditions. The Millstone Grit Group is a formal stratigraphic term for this sequence of rocks.|$|E
50|$|When the menhir was {{discovered}} it was composed by three orthogonal fragments of sandstone, headed NE-SW. After studying them, {{it was concluded}} that the three pieces could be put together and fitted perfectly to form the original menhir. Despite the impacts the rocks had due to the clearing labours, the menhir is preserved in good conditions. The stones measure 480x60x60 cm and it is considered that its density could reach 2500 kg/m3; so the menhir weights over 4250 kg. Lithologically, its stones are <b>siliceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> which probably come from Illumbe, the slope of Usoteguieta mountain. As the distance between Illumbe and the menhir is over 100m, archaeologists have assumed that the stones were carried by taking advantage of the slope. It was believed that the menhir could be an anthropomorphic sculpture but this discovery has not been verified.|$|E
50|$|Spathic {{iron ores}} {{are rich in}} {{manganese}} and have negligible phosphorus. This led to their one major benefit, connected with the Bessemer steel-making process. Although the first demonstrations by Bessemer in 1856 had been successful, later attempts to reproduce this were infamously failures. Work by the metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet discovered {{that the reason for}} this was the nature of the Swedish ores that Bessemer had innocently used, being very low in phosphorus. Using a typical European high-phosphorus ore in Bessemer's converter gave a poor quality steel. To produce high quality steel from a high-phosphorus ore, Mushet realised that he could operate the Bessemer converter for longer, burning off all the steel's impurities including the unwanted phosphorus and the essential carbon, but then re-adding carbon, with manganese, {{in the form of a}} previously obscure ferromanganese ore with no phosphorus, spiegeleisen. This created a sudden demand for spiegeleisen. Although it was not available in sufficient quantity as a mineral, steelworks such as that at Ebbw Vale in South Wales soon learned to make it from the spathic siderite ores. For a few decades, spathic ores were now in demand and this encouraged their mining. In time though, the original 'acidic' liner, made from <b>siliceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> or ganister, of the Bessemer converter was replaced by a 'basic' liner in the developed Gilchrist Thomas process. This removed the phosphorus impurities as slag, produced by chemical reaction with the liner, and no longer required spiegeleisen. From the 1880s demand for the ores fell once again and many of their mines, including those of the Brendon Hills, closed soon after.|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{conducted}} to determine the correlation of field performance to Hamburg Wheel Tracking Device (HWTD) testing results. The HWTD measures the combined effects of rutting and moisture damage by rolling a steel wheel {{across the surface of}} an asphalt concrete specimen that is immersed in hot water. Three designs (Superpave, CMHB-C, and Type C) and three aggregate sources (<b>siliceous</b> gravel, <b>sandstone,</b> and quartzite) were used for this study. The test sections, including nine different mixture designs, were constructed on IH- 20 in Harrison County to observe the performance of the overlays under real traffic conditions. Field performance was observed through visual pavement condition surveys and nondestructive tests for 4 years. This research report summarizes the nondestructive test results and visual pavement condition surveys in the fifth year of this study. Several different measurements were used for this research, including the International Roughness Index (IRI), field rut depth, falling weight deflectometer (FWD), and portable seismic pavement analyzer (PSPA). Finally, traffic data analysis was used to compare the HWTD results and field rutting. There were no stripping problems observed in the field or lab specimens. Thus similar types of deformation patterns were assumed for both the lab specimens and field test sections. At the end of the study...|$|R
50|$|The final type of {{tessellated}} pavement {{consists of}} relatively flat, sandstone surfaces that typically exhibit a complex pattern of five- or six-sided polygons. Typically, these polygons vary greatly {{in size from}} 0.5 to 2 m in width. These polygons are defined by well-developed fractures that sometimes have raised rims. They are found within exposures of the Hawkesbury Sandstone within the Sydney, Australia region, exposures of the Precipice Sandstone at the Kenniff Cave Archaeological Site in Queensland, Australia, and in exposures of Upper Cretaceous sandstones of the Boulder, Colorado, region. The origin {{of this type of}} tessellated pavement remains uncertain. The size and shape of these polygons appears to be dependent to a large extent on the grain size, texture, and coherence of the rock. This polygonal tessellation is best developed in relatively fine-grained, uniform, and <b>siliceous</b> or silicified <b>sandstones.</b>|$|R

The quarry outcrop at Skrzydlna {{near the}} {{southern}} {{margin of the}} Silesian Nappe central sector (Polak 2000) exposes a heterogeneous succession that occurs within the Menilite beds (Oligocene). The aim of this work is to present preliminary observations on details of lithological, sedimentological and structural development of this sequence. The discussed succession belongs to a structure identified as the Skrzydlna scale, and is underlain by the classic lithological association of the Menilite beds present {{in the region that}} shows the predominant palaeoucrrent directions towards the SW: dark brown siliceous menilite shales, thin-bedded and fine-grained turbidite sandstones associated with black siliceous shales and ferroan concretions (Polak 2000). This is overlain by <b>siliceous</b> <b>sandstones</b> with shales and intercalations of marl. The observations presented here document several previously unpublished details of ca. 50 metres thick succession that comprises the following complexes (in stratigraphically ascending order) : (i) sandstone, medium grained, totally devoid of mudstone layers and composed of massive amalgamated beds; (ii) dark shales with very thin sandstone interbeds characteristic for the Menilite beds; (iii) thin- to medium-bedded light grey weathering marls passing upwards into laminated marls; (iv) chaotic polymictic conglomerate/sedimentary breccia (ca 17 m thick), matrix- to clast-supported, which rests upon the underlying marl unit with a pronounced erosional contact; (v) massive, channel-fill sandstone with thickness changing laterally from 2 to 1 meter; (vi) three turbidite sequences: fining upwards (F-U) to medium and thin-bedded sandstones with subordinate mudstones that pass to a coarsening upwards (C-U) succession of massive, amalgamated sandstone beds (the most "proximal" facies type), which grades into a F-U sequence. The characteristic sedimentary features of this succession include: features of some turbidite beds that are characteristic for supply from hyperpycnal flows; occurrences of linked debrites (turbidite beds succeeded by co-genetic debrite); slump beds and creep-deformed sandstone dykes; slide sheets of intrabasinal rocks; large-scale debris flow beds (olistostrome beds) containing blocks as large as ca. 2 metres across. Structurally, these strata are deformed by networks of joints, which show density and orientation differing between individual lithological complexes. This probably reflects variations in competence of compositionally and texturally different units, eg. the marl complex labelled (iii) above the overlying debris flow deposit (iv). The above features suggest that the discussed succession originated as a result of interplay of mass-transport deposition (MTD) and sedimentation out of a variety of turbidite flows. This conclusion expands the earlier interpretation of this association as an olistostrome intercalated within the Menilite beds of the Skrzydlna area advanced by Cieszkowski et al. (2012) and Cieszkowski (2006). The features outlined above imply the position in the basin proximal to a tectonically active, elevated source area and supply by combination of debris flows, slumping, slab-sliding, and periodic contribution of terrigenous detritus directly from a fluvial system on the adjacent land.
