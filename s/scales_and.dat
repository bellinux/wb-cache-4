5|$|The holotype {{and only}} known specimen, {{which is in}} very poor condition, is {{preserved}} in the Museum d'Histoire Naturel de Neuchâtel as specimen MHNN 91.2426. It has five auricular lobules {{in front of the}} ears {{on each side of the}} head, 39 rows of scales around the midbody, keels on its dorsal <b>scales,</b> <b>and</b> the third supraocular scale in contact with the frontal scale, all characters which align it with Trachylepis rather than Mabuya. The other putative mainland South American Trachylepis, T.maculata, has five instead of three keels, 32 to 34 midbody <b>scales,</b> <b>and</b> separated parietal scales. T.tschudii agrees with the Noronha skink in size, coloration, numbers of <b>scales,</b> <b>and</b> discrete characters, such as having the supranasal, parietal, and prefrontal scales all in contact.|$|E
5|$|The scales {{around the}} eye are called circumorbital <b>scales</b> <b>and</b> are named as ocular scales but with {{appropriate}} prefixes. The ocular scale proper is a transparent scale covering the eye {{which is called}} the spectacle, brille or eyecap. The circumorbital scales towards the snout or the front are called preocular scales, those towards the rear are called postocular <b>scales,</b> <b>and</b> those towards the upper or dorsal side are called supraocular scales. Circumorbital scales towards the ventral or lower side, if any, are called subocular scales. Between the preocular and the postnasal scales are one or two scales called loreal scales. Loreal scales are absent in elapids.|$|E

Methods 28 VDPs and 420 patients participated. Patients were randomly allocated to either group. Patients' and VDPs' attitudes towards, and experience of, the <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> polish were elicited by means of self-administered questionnaires.

These scales give butterfly wings their colour: they are pigmented with melanins that give them blacks and browns, as well as uric acid derivatives and flavones that give them yellows, {{but many of the}} blues, greens, reds and iridescent colours are created by structural coloration produced by the micro-structures of the <b>scales</b> <b>and</b> hairs.|$|E

40|$|Most {{studies on}} the economies of <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> scope in the banking {{industry}} assume no x-inefficiencies. That is, banks {{are assumed to be}} always on their efficient frontier, which can in empirical studies confound <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> scope efficiencies with x-efficiencies. The current paper employs a stochastic frontier cost function incorporating technical and allocative inefficiencies, as well as a system of share equations, to estimate <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> scope efficiencies. Using data from Taiwan's banking industry, evidence is found that both <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> scope economies exist, and that the assumption of no x-inefficiencies results in underestimating such economies. ...|$|R

Using meta-regression analysis, the study investigates which variables from published studies influence these economies. Our analysis led to several conclusions.

Diseconomies of <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> scope {{are more likely to be}} found in publicly-owned utilities than when the ownership is mostly private; as would be expected, multi-utilities are more likely to have <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> scope economies. ...|$|R

We modify {{a wide range}} of state-of-the-art collaborative filtering systems to make them <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> translation invariant and generally improve their accuracy without increasing their computational cost. Using the EachMovie and the Jester data sets, we show that learning-free constant time <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> translation invariant schemes outperforms other learning-free constant time schemes by at least 3 % and perform as well as expensive memory-based schemes (within 4 %). Over the Jester data set, we show that a <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> translation invariant Eigentaste algorithm outperforms Eigentaste 2. 0 by 20 %.

The objective is to assess whether different ownership types and banking reforms affect economies of <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> scope. The traditional nonfrontier approach and the standard measures are also applied for comparison and completeness. The results indicate the presence of constant returns to <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> significant economies of scope for most joint stock banks throughout the period, and for state-owned banks in the later part of period, following {{a second set of}} bank reforms. There is evidence that use of the traditional nonfrontier model biases the measures of <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> scope economies. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Evaluate the {{adjunctive}} use {{of locally}} delivered green tea catechin with <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> root planing, {{as compared to}} <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> root planing alone {{in the management of}} chronic periodontitis. Materials and Methods: Fourteen patients with two sites in the contralateral quadrants with probing pocket depth of 5 − 8 mm were selected. Each of the sites was assessed for the plaque index, gingival index, and probing pocket depth at baseline and 21 days and for microbiological analysis at baseline, 1 week and 21 days. Test sites received <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> root planing along with green tea catechin strips and control sites received <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> root planning alone. Results: The result showed intercomparison of the plaque index and gingival index for test and control groups at 21 days was not significant with P> 0. 05, whereas the probing depth at 21 days was significant with P< 0. 001. Intercomparison between microbial results demonstrated a considerable reduction of occurrence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium species and Capnocytophaga in test.
