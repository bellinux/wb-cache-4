5000|$|The {{following}} {{types of}} sex <b>swing</b> exist: traditional <b>swing,</b> door <b>swing,</b> body <b>swing,</b> and fantasy <b>swing.</b> The body <b>swing</b> is suspended from one partner's body. The door <b>swing</b> {{is mounted on}} a door. The fantasy <b>swing</b> is suspended from an eye bolt in the ceiling. In popular culture, sex <b>swing</b> is mostly associated with BDSM practices.|$|R
5000|$|In Estonian, kiik means a <b>swing.</b> In a kiiking <b>swing,</b> the <b>swing</b> {{arms are}} made of steel to enable a person to <b>swing</b> 360 degrees going over the [...] of the <b>swing.</b> A person is {{fastened}} to the <b>swing</b> base by their feet. To <b>swing,</b> the person begins to pump by squatting and standing up on the <b>swing.</b> The <b>swing</b> will gain momentum and will, by skillful pumping, take a person over the fulcrum.|$|R

5|$|Six months later, Alex, Clear, and Carter {{travel to}} Paris to {{celebrate}} their survival. While discussing their ordeal, Alex realizes that death never skipped him. After seeing more omens he leaves the table, and is almost hit by a bus, which swerves and crashes into a large neon sign that <b>swings</b> down towards Alex. Carter pushes Alex {{out of the way}} at the last second, and Alex says that Death has skipped him. When Carter asks who is next, the sign suddenly <b>swings</b> back down towards Carter.|$|E

5|$|Behind his seemingly-perfect life of glamorous friends, {{gold-plated}} tyre <b>swings,</b> {{and personal}} chefs, {{there is a}} dark history of medical experiments, addiction and loss. But Bubbles has fought against his personal and professional problems and, with his help of man-pet Michael Jackson, he has grown to become bigger than King Kong—figuratively speaking.|$|E
50|$|A {{familiar}} {{example is}} a playground <b>swing,</b> which acts as a pendulum. Pushing {{a person in a}} <b>swing</b> in time with the natural interval of the <b>swing</b> (its resonant frequency) makes the <b>swing</b> go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while attempts to push the <b>swing</b> at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs. This is because the energy the <b>swing</b> absorbs is maximized when the pushes match the <b>swing's</b> natural oscillations.|$|R

5|$|Chaco endures {{remarkable}} climatic extremes: temperatures {{range between}} , and may swing 60°F (33°C) {{in a single}} day. The region averages fewer than 150frost-free days per year, and the local climate <b>swings</b> wildly from years of plentiful rainfall to prolonged drought. The heavy influence of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation contributes to the canyon's fickle climate.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 b has an orbital {{eccentricity}} of 0.61, denoting a very elliptical orbit. The planet's discoverers noted that if water {{existed in the}} planet's atmosphere, it might change from a liquid state to a gaseous state as the planet <b>swings</b> closer to its host star, increasing its temperature.|$|E
5|$|He {{also showed}} a good eye at the plate. Of 15 Rangers who {{had at least}} 100 at bats, his rate of only one strikeout per 8.31 at-bats was the best on the team. Similarly, he made contact on 87% of his <b>swings,</b> the best contact rate on the team.|$|E

50|$|Therefore any {{theory of}} correct <b>swing</b> timing, in {{practice}} and teaching, must rely on correct <b>swing</b> rhythm emphasis, including learning, teaching and practice devices that provide instant feedback of correct <b>swing</b> rhythm for every <b>swing.</b>|$|R
25|$|Reverse <b>swing</b> is a {{phenomenon}} that makes the ball <b>swing</b> {{in the opposite direction}} to that usually produced by the orientation of the shiny and rough sides of the ball. When the ball is reverse <b>swinging,</b> the ball will <b>swing</b> towards the shiny side. Balls that reverse <b>swing</b> move much later and much more sharply than those <b>swinging</b> conventionally, both factors increasing the difficulty the batsman will have in trying to hit the ball. At speeds of over 90mph a ball will always exhibit reverse <b>swing,</b> but as roughness increases on the leading side, the speed at which reverse <b>swing</b> occurs decreases. This means that an older ball {{is more likely to be}} delivered with reverse <b>swing</b> as its surface will have been roughened through use.|$|R
5|$|Rahman {{achieved}} {{success in}} the beginning of his international career by bowling off cutters, a type of bowling which <b>swings</b> the ball away. Rahman stated on a press conference in June 2015 that he first discovered the technique after his fellow cricketer, Anamul Haque insisted him to bowl a slower delivery.|$|E
5|$|The three-minute ride {{features}} 32 suspended twin seats (64 seats altogether) {{spinning around}} a central tower. A lighting package was installed {{on all four}} WindSeekers, consisting of strips of LED lights mounted on the arms that support the <b>swings</b> and (except at Knott's Berry Farm) colored floodlights to illuminate towers from above.|$|E
5|$|After Paradise Interchange, the busway passes under Darley Road, {{then over}} the Torrens {{for the last}} time. The terrain becomes steeper as the busway {{proceeds}} up along the outflow creek and past the northwestern side of the Hope Valley Reservoir. It proceeds north under Grand Junction Road, then <b>swings</b> east and north again to enter {{the eastern side of}} the Tea Tree Plaza shopping centre precinct, where the guided busway ends at Tea Tree Plaza Interchange. Most buses continue on normal roads to service suburbs further afield.|$|E
50|$|A checked <b>swing</b> {{is a type}} {{of motion}} in {{baseball}} made by a batter. A checked <b>swing</b> occurs when a batter starts to <b>swing</b> his bat at the ball, but stops the <b>swing</b> in order to allow the ball to pass without hitting it. If the <b>swing</b> was indeed checked, so that there was no <b>swing,</b> then if the bat did not touch the ball and if the ball did not go through the strike zone, the pitch counts as a ball; but in that circumstance if the <b>swing</b> was not checked, so that a <b>swing</b> occurred, then the pitch counts as a strike.|$|R
50|$|Ado Kosk {{observed}} {{that it becomes}} more difficult to <b>swing</b> over the fulcrum as {{the arms of the}} <b>swing</b> become longer. He then designed and patented telescoping <b>swing</b> arms to gradually extend the arms for an increased challenge. The person able to <b>swing</b> over the fulcrum with the longest <b>swing</b> arms is the winner.|$|R

5|$|Below the dam {{the river}} flows west, passing the mostly dry Lower Klamath Lake {{bed and the}} {{hydroelectric}} John C. Boyle Dam. The Klamath River then enters California, where it passes through three more hydroelectric plants and turns south {{near the town of}} Hornbrook towards Mount Shasta. However, the river soon <b>swings</b> west to receive the Shasta River and the Scott River, entering a long canyon through the Klamath Mountains.|$|E

He suffered from clinical depression, {{and has had}} drug-related problems, but works with the sports psychologist Steve Peters, who has helped him overcome his mood <b>swings.</b> Noted for repeatedly declaring his intention to leave the sport, O'Sullivan worked during the 2012/2013 season on a pig farm.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995–96 season UConn ended Tennessee's home court {{winning streak}} at Thompson Boling Arena in Knoxville. Tennessee avenged {{itself in the}} Final Four that year in Charlotte, {{defeating}} UConn 88–83 in overtime; the game is often thought {{to be one of}} the more memorable tournament games in tournament history with many back and forth <b>swings</b> of momentum.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn many sports, {{the maximum}} <b>swing</b> {{speed of a}} racket, club or bat is a key {{performance}} parameter. Previous {{research has suggested that}} a logarithmic relationship exists between the resultant <b>swing</b> speed and the <b>swing</b> weight/moment of inertia of the implement. However, these studies have only focussed on one specific sport and relatively {{little is known about the}} effect of <b>swing</b> weight on <b>swing</b> speed across the wider spectrum of sport. Data was collated on the <b>swing</b> speeds achieved in numerous sports that employ an implement and a <b>swinging</b> motion. A range of typical <b>swing</b> weights were determined for the various implements and the data normalised to common conventions such that comparisons could be made. This meta-analysis established a new relationship between <b>swing</b> weight and <b>swing</b> acceleration, valid across the wide range of implements considered. This relationship was found to be of the form a=C/Im, where C is a player constant and m= 0. 59 (p< 0. 01) ...|$|R
50|$|Bridge swing: The {{challenge}} {{was for the}} remaining 8 players to <b>swing</b> off of a bridge. If all 8 completed the <b>swing</b> within one hour of the first player <b>swinging</b> off the bridge, they would earn £20,000. All 8 completed the <b>swing.</b>|$|R
5|$|Love in Motion {{peaked at}} its début {{position}} of number four on the RIANZ New Zealand Albums Chart. The album {{remained on the}} chart for eleven non-consecutive weeks. This makes it Moa's second-highest peaking album, behind Thinking Room (2001), which peaked at number-one on the Albums Chart. It is also her third-longest charting album, behind Thinking Room and In <b>Swings</b> the Tide (2007), which spent forty-five and thirty-nine weeks on the chart, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{not only}} {{contains}} two radically different climatic zones, the rainforests {{of the east}} and the dry regions of the west, but also <b>swings</b> from extended drought to cyclone-generated floods. These climatic and geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity, wide ranges of ecosystem complexity, and a lack of regularly fruiting trees (such as fig trees) have driven the evolution of lemurs' immense morphological and behavioral diversity. Their survival has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.|$|E
5|$|Mark's father {{remarried}} {{and raised}} them strictly, seeking to influence {{them to become}} leaders. Throughout his childhood and teenage years, Mark's father would have him combine athletic and mental training. Mark would have to dribble a basketball without looking at it while reciting multiplication tables; practice baseball <b>swings</b> in a batting cage while answering questions about the periodic table and similar combined drills that his father hoped would develop quick thinking and self-confidence that would guide Mark {{in all areas of}} life and not simply sports.|$|E
50|$|In <b>swing</b> timing the {{emphasis}} is therefore on the correct sequence of the various elements of the total <b>swing.</b> Whereas in <b>swing</b> rhythm {{the focus is on}} the tempo, and relative 'weight' of each component within that tempo of the ideal personal <b>swing.</b>|$|R
30|$|In the {{preliminary}} tests {{it was the}} thought to use a Charpy machine and a <b>swing</b> hammer with a mass of 1.983  kg (subsequently designated as “small <b>swing</b> hammer”). The first experiments showed that {{the mass of the}} small <b>swing</b> hammer did not suffice. Because of this fact another <b>swing</b> hammer with a mass of 6.610  kg was implemented in the small-scale tests (subsequently designated as “large <b>swing</b> hammer”). The height of fall for both <b>swing</b> hammers was 0.756  m.|$|R
50|$|Whereas <b>swing</b> {{timing is}} {{pertinent}} to the sequence of vital <b>swing</b> components coming into effect for optimum ball contact, Swing rhythm is the tempo of the complete <b>swing,</b> which traditionally includes the backswing, and a vital pause between backswing and final <b>swing</b> towards ball impact.|$|R
