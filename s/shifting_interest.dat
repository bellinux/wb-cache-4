The project emphasizes the need for critical race theory in game studies to understand how race is informed and reshaped by the logics of gameplay resulting in the multi-layered, politically complex, and agile concept of gamic race. Displaced racialization, the project's other key concept, revises former studies of race in digital media that focus predominantly on representation, <b>shifting</b> <b>interest</b> to racialization occurring alongside or beyond bodies within game code and player experience. Moving along this trajectory, the first three chapters of Gamic Race explore different layers of gamic race and its formulation through displaced racialization: spatial, technologic, and discursive.

These raids serve as a compelling but flawed model for future progressive performative interventions in gamespace.   The conclusion considers how to progressively transform videogame design by placing African American expressive traditions, indie games, ethics, philosophy, and the interaction design of Erik Loyer in conversation.

On the other hand banks must also comply with the guidelines of Bank Indonesia and the Financial Services Authority (FSA/ OJK). Based on this phenomenon then examined whether the perceived quality of the customer {{in this case is}} related to the bank customer satisfaction and loyalty as well as affect the desire or interest to switch banks. So the research problems are: 1) How does the quality of services and customer satisfaction bank and 2) What is the impact of customer satisfaction to customer loyalty and switch intention.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the implementation of}} Balanced Scorecard (BSC) in health care organisations. BSC, a management control model based on measurements in different perspectives, {{has become one of}} the most popular performance measurement models during the last two decades and widely adopted in practice. However, studies have noticed that models are rarely used in the same way in different settings. From the perspective of Scandinavian institutionalism, a model that is moved from one place to another has been "translated. " Translation is a process in which an abstract idea is transferred into an object, developed into practical use, and stabilised into an institution. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of how a management control model influences and is influenced by the medical professional context. The ambition is to investigate how BSC has been translated in the Swedish and the Canadian health care contexts. Furthermore the purpose is to develop our understanding of measurements in professional organisations and to develop our understanding of the translation process. The study shows that the main purpose of implementing BSC in the health care organisations is to support improvements in the quality of care. Whereas a free translation process in the Swedish case allowed actors to interpret and reinterpret the model and to create specific performance measurements for reporting professional performance, a controlled translation process in the Canadian case resulted in medical professionals being unable to reinterpret the model. Instead, BSC came to represent the private company's way of acting, declaring disciplinary accountability and <b>shifting</b> <b>interest</b> from public administration and towards the business firm. Based on the findings, this study stresses that a model can materialize both in the forms of practical use and talk, and that different translations can result in disputes and negotiations among actors with different interests. This study also analyses and develops the concept of transparency, and suggests that actors will use different performance measurements depending on what type of transparency (openness, visibility or hyaline) is requested. Finally, it is suggested that disciplinary accountability may result in actors focusing on finding the perfect measurements, whereas socializing form of accountability may create a greater focus on reciprocal accountability for improvements...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 74 - 78. With {{the ending}} of the {{apartheid}} regime and the transition to power of a government of national unity, South Africa is now a legitimate member of the international community. It has joined the Organisation of African Unity, the British Commonwealth, and the Southern African Development Community, and it is busily fostering trade links with Europe, North America, the Far East, and Latin America. Its diplomats have worked to mediate conflicts in Angola and Mozambique, and its president is widely seen as an international statesman and a moral leader of almost unprecedented repute. Yet the newÂ· government continues to operate within South Africa's traditional international paradigm and has not yet developed a unique global role that reflects the country's internal "negotiated revolution". As a result, substantial challenges face efforts to forge a new south African approach to the world. From outside the country, forces unleashed by the fall of communism and the rise of a truly global marketplace mark a volatile and uncertain transition in world history. From the inside, political transition has sparked a redefinition {{of what it means to}} be South African, but this has not been reflected in new policies. The Foreign Ministry is widely recognised as a bastion of old-guard stalwarts; the ANC and NP have done little to reconcile their past international experiences; and. the information flow on international political and economic trends has barely improved since April 1994, leaving interest groups and private citizens in the new democracy generally uninformed and therefore unable to help pressure policy. The result is a foreign policy over the past year that has had little vision and few cohesive threads, and has left a score of unresolved issues. The 'new' South Africa's relations with Cuba and China, its policies on illegal immigration, and regional development plans are all issues that require visionary, decisive leadership but for which none has yet been provided. What energy or vision, for example, has South Africa brought to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) since it joined last August? In the global peacekeeping debate, and again with Cuba and China, South Africa has made little effort to recognise more pro-active roles for which it is well equipped. Why is it not asserting itself? Who actually is in charge of its foreign policy? Few thus would deny that a paralysis has settled in on South African foreign policy. A recent analysis in the Weekly Mail lamented, "We are not consistent. We have not formulated clear principles. The formulators of our foreign policy do not consult with the people. The new appointments to our foreign ministry complain of being sidelined. There is no clear break with the past". At the core of this inaction is the fact that policy makers have failed to reconceptualise the way international issues are seen and policy is made. The world has changed and South Africa has changed, both dramatically; yet Cold War debates still divide the policy framework, old style security thinking still dominates higher ranks, and most importantly, the growing inter linkages between domestic and foreign policies in a post-Cold War world have gone largely unheeded. It is thus appropriate to sound a note of urgency: change and uncertainty in the world and dramatic transformation at home combine to make this an inopportune, even dangerous, time to have a directionless foreign policy. The broad purposeÂ· of this paper is to identify the salient external and internal factors that will drive a new South African approach to the world. The first chapter presents a synthesis of dominant global trends, and sets them against the backdrop of major structural changes in international relations. The second chapter discusses change in South Africa in relation to world changes, new state objectives and <b>shifting</b> <b>interest</b> groups, and considers these implications for three major foreign policy areas. The third chapter looks at the policy framework and the ability of policy makers to conceptualise these dual changes and to formulate effective policies. The final chapter offers a 'road map' of policy options towards a true postapartheid, post-Cold War foreign policy...|$|E
40|$|Many markers {{associated}} with atherosclerosis {{have been identified}} in the last 50 years. Some of them act as factors, both mathematically (factors = risk multipliers) and biologically (factors from the latin facient, producing), and others are mere indicators. Among the novel markers, many are strictly connected with inflammation or coagulation. Some studies on these markers have been considered with suspect, because they were conducted on patients rather than on general population, because the number of subjects was low, or because the experimental design was inadequate. Nevertheless, the results of all studies are univocal and similar to those of population-based large-scale studies. Today there is, therefore, general agreement on the role of these novel markers. Although incertitude remains about the underlying pathophysiological mechanism, inflammation and haemostasis are considered as driving forces in the process of atherosclerosis. There is evidence of inflammation in vascular atherosclerotic disease. Activated mast cells are present in human coronary atheromas {{as well as in the}} adventitia of coronary arteries of patients with variant angina, the CD 3 +/DR+ T-lymphocytes are more represented in variant than in stable angina, and inflammatory burden controlateral to a symptomatic carotid stenosis has been detected using high-resolution magnetic resonance. More generally, inflammation and neoangiogenesis play a central role in atherosclerosis and make the atherosclerotic process a continual evolving model. Sometimes (as in the case of subjects with Clamydia pneumoniae or periodontal disease), the inflammatory response to a well-determined infection turns out to be atherogenetic, probably promoting a pro-atherogenic serum lipid profile. In other cases—the great majority—the link of atherogenesis with inflammation is uncertain or even merely presumptive. Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) is an index of glomerular dysfunction and an independent predictor of atherosclerosis and its complications as well. The so-called microalbuminuria (UAE 30 – 300 mg/day or albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30 – 300 mg/dL) determined by sensitive techniques is even an earlier predictor. Carotid arteries have been commonly used to demonstrate this association simply because the supraortic district is more accessible to ultrasonographic techniques, and in this site plaques can be detected and measured with extreme precision. UAE is a continuous variable and should not be categorized. Jorgensen et al. just tackle this topic by analysing in a longitudinal perspective 4037 cases from general population after excluding those with diabetes or with known inflammatory disease. Their results, deriving from a very accurate phenotype, indicate that albumin-to-creatinine ratio, even far lower than the usual label of microalbuminuria, is {{associated with}} carotid plaque development. Nephropathy sustaining albuminuria must be, of course, a concomitant or an indicator, rather than the cause, of a general endothelial vascular dysfunction, but the mechanism of this association is uncertain, particularly in non-diabetic subjects. Early nephropathy actually correlates with atherosclerosis and its complications (in our general population, top vs. bottom serum creatinine, even in the normal range, increases by the risk of coronary death five-fold in elderly men). 8 As a matter of fact, it may be difficult to clarify whether UAE, an expression of renal microcirculatory abnormality, acts as a marker of early nephropathy rather than of atherosclerosis per se. The link between these two conditions must be chronic low-grade inflammation. UAE correlates with fibrinogen, homocysteine, and C-reactive protein, <b>shifting</b> <b>interest</b> from kidney to inflammation/haemostasis or perhaps underlying the flogistic component of both early nephropathy and early atherosclerosis. Tzoulaki et al. in another longitudinal study among a great number of subjects also highlight inflammatory, haemostatic, and rheological biomarkers of incident vascular damage, namely, C-reactive protein, interleukin- 6, fibrinogen, d-dimer, adhesion molecules, haematocrit, and blood viscosity. The increasing evidence suggests that C-reactive protein and fibrinogen are useful in assessing cardiovascular risk. C-reactive protein has numerous atherogenic effects such as generation of oxygen radicals, clotting, expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, and plaque destabilization. Out of acute occasional inflammation, high levels of high-sensitive C-reactive protein are a marker of vasospasm and have also been related to increased risk, particularly in low-to-intermediate-risk subjects. C-reactive protein responds well to vitamin E, β-blockers, ezetimibe, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin IItype 1 (AT 1) antagonists, and glitazones, leading to possible prevention, and men with high C-reactive protein could be more responsive to aspirin and statin prophylaxis. C-reactive protein inter-relates with high fibrinogen, a factor that has been found in epidemiological studies and meta-analysis to double the risk of coronary attack and stroke in high-risk men. As fibrinogen is significantly associated with cardiovascular risk also after adjustment for C-reactive protein, these two markers represent different, independent aspects of the inflammatory process. Fibrinogen may mediate its pro-atherogenic effects by increasing plasma viscosity, by stimulating smooth muscle proliferation, and by promoting platelet aggregability via glycoprotein complex IIb–IIIa. As fibrinogen strictly depends on body mass index and smoking, its increase may be in a certain measure prevented by lifestyle measures. Other inflammatory and haemostatic factors have been associated with atherosclerosis. For example, if blood samples are taken with care avoiding release from red cells, homocysteine shows an association with coronary risk. This indicator emerged years ago, when it was demonstrated that its presumptive vascular effect could be prevented by folate administration (unfortunately another study questioned this possibility). Gout is an inflammatory process, so the evidence that serum uric acid (SUA) promotes inflammation was not at all a surprise. SUA is associated/correlated with UAE and may cause vascular injury by decreasing the production of nitric oxide, by impairing endothelial proliferation, by altering signalling transduction, and through a pro-oxidative action. However, whether SUA actually contributes to the disease process or is a mere indicator is still object of debate. In our experience, SUA predicts coronary mortality in general population. Via URAT- 1 renal protein, AT 1 -antagonists have uricosuric properties, a class-specific effect that could potentially be useful in subjects receiving these drugs for indications other than hyperuricaemia (more in general, AT 1 -antagonists also tend to inhibit inflammation, interleukins, and COX- 2 /mPGES- 1 expression and as a consequence to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques). In conclusion, several novel risk factors, very often related to inflammation or haemostasis, have come to the limelight in the last years and are currently considered risk multipliers and first-line markers of cardiovascular risk. The list of these novel risk factors is largely incomplete. Those shown in Table 1 are indicative of subclinical organ damage or hidden arteriosclerosis of a degree insufficient to produce a clinical disease, but able to alter peripheral vessels and to increase cardiovascular events. In this perspective, they could allow early screening of those subjects who should be addressed to special surveillance or to stronger prophylaxis. Owing to ethical and economical considerations, it is therefore foreseeable that in the near future they all will end up being included in risk charts (as already proposed, for instance, for pulse pressure) ...|$|E
