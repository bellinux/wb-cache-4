5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, <b>systemic</b> <b>infection,</b> syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E
25|$|Mastitis is an {{inflammation}} of the breast. It causes local pain (dolor), redness (rubor), swelling (tumor), and warmth (calor). Later stages of mastitis cause symptoms of <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> like fever and nausea. It mostly occurs 2â€“3 weeks after delivery but can happen at any time. Typically results from milk stasis with primary or secondary local, later <b>systemic</b> <b>infection.</b> Infectious organisms include Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp. and E. coli. Continued breastfeeding, plenty of rest and adequate fluid supply is the best treatment for light cases.|$|E
25|$|Antimicrobials {{that reduce}} the number of the strict {{anaerobic}} component of the gut flora (i.e., metronidazole) generally should not be given because they may enhance <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> by aerobic or facultative bacteria, thus facilitating mortality after irradiation.|$|E

25|$|Biofilm {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reasons for delayed healing in {{pressure}} ulcers. Biofilm occurs rapidly in wounds and stalls healing by keeping the wound inflamed. Frequent debridement and antimicrobial dressings are needed to control the biofilm. Infection prevents healing of pressure ulcers. Signs of pressure ulcer infection include slow or delayed healing and pale granulation tissue. Signs and symptoms of <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> include fever, pain, redness, swelling, warmth of the area, and purulent discharge. Additionally, infected wounds may have a gangrenous smell, be discolored, and may eventually produce more pus.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, {{after failing}} to take {{antibiotics}} to protect his heart before a dental visit, Darin developed an overwhelming <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> (sepsis). This further weakened his body and affected one of his heart valves. On December 11, he checked himself into Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles for another round of open-heart surgery to repair the two artificial heart valves he had received in January 1971. On the evening of December 19, a five-man surgical team worked for over six hours to repair his damaged heart. Shortly after the surgery ended {{in the early morning}} hours of December 20, 1973, Darin died in the recovery room without regaining consciousness. He was 37 years old.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, over 400 {{cases of}} cowpox {{infection}} from cats to human have been described. The symptoms differ between both humans and cats. In people, local exanthema {{appears on the}} arms and face. The infection resolves on its own but those who are immunosuppressed can progress to <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> that closely resembles smallpox. When the infection has expanded to severe symptoms, it can be lethal. The signs of cowpox infection in cats can be seen as, multiple skin sores on the paws, neck, head and mouth. The cat can also develop a purulent discharge from the eyes. Necrotizing pneumonia has also been observed. Estimates that 50% of human cases of cowpox are due to transmission from cats in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Inflammation in {{the body}} may lead to effects on the brain via the blood-brain barrier (BBB). During {{systemic}} inflammation, whether {{in the form of}} infection or sterile inflammation, the BBB may undergo changes which may be disruptive or non-disruptive. Such changes may be part of a productive host response to systemic inflammation, or may lead to deleterious consequences within the central nervous system. These BBB changes likely {{play a role in the}} generation of sickness behaviour during <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> (why we feel 'unwell' when we have an infection). These changes may also induce or accelerate disease within the brain, for example in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, and may be part of the reason why patients with these conditions can deteriorate during an infection. Also, in patients with neurological disease the BBB may be abnormally sensitive to the effects of systemic inflammation.|$|E
25|$|When the {{infection}} occurs {{in an early}} stage of the tomato plant there may be wilting on leaves because Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis enter the plant by wounds, including root wounds, and if the bacterium gets to the xylem then a <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> is likely that may plug the xylem vessels. The wilting may only show {{on one side of the}} leaf and may recover during cooler periods. The entire system of xylem within the plant allows the bacteria to form titers of up to 10^9 bacteria per gram of plant tissue. Wilting may eventually spread to all leaves and these leaves, along with their petioles, may also show distorted, curled growth. One way to diagnose a severe vascular infection is to pinch the stem. If the epidermis and outer layer of the cortex separate from the inner stem then you've got a severe vascular infection. These exposed parts will have a soapy feel. Canker lesions, though rare, may develop on the stem. These cankers are necrotic regions where the epidermis is gone. As the bacteria continues its colonization, the canker will deepen and expand. In terms of fruit development, tomatoes may fail to develop altogether or may look marbled because they are ripening unevenly.|$|E

[...] However, a PICC poses less of a <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> risk than other central IV lines, because the {{insertion site}} is usually cooler and drier than the sites typically used for other central lines.

2500|$|Abdominal trauma can be {{life-threatening}} because abdominal organs, {{especially those}} in the retroperitoneal space, can bleed profusely, and the space can hold a great deal of blood.

[...] Hollow organs such as the stomach, while not as likely to result in shock from profuse bleeding, present a serious risk of infection, especially if such an injury is not treated promptly.
