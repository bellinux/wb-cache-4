50|$|The {{first use}} of {{wireless}} communications on The Farm was in 1971, when a ham radio HF <b>SSB</b> <b>system</b> was set up. Ham radio was used for health and welfare regional communications between mobile ham operators {{who were on the}} road with The Farm Band. The Farm Net, as the ham radio network was known, evolved into a worldwide daily operations schedule on 21332 kHz and 21442 kHz Upper Sideband in the 15-meter band, and a regional schedule on the 40-meter ham band. At the network's peak in 1978, The Farm Net included over 40 ham radio operators on associated and affinity communities, as well as many HF SSB mobiles. From its main base station, The Farm Net expanded to cover HF SSB communication links to stations in North America, Africa, and Europe using a field of tall radio towers on The Farm's ridgetop. Ham radio operators from The Farm volunteered with the Plenty International disaster relief operations for the 1976 Guatemala earthquake, with the Greenpeace anti-whaling campaigns, and many humanitarian response efforts worldwide. Ham radio was invaluable for voice communications consultations between doctors and field medical teams, and it included the use of HF slow scan TV for the relatively new concept of telemedicine. The ham radio was also used for technical discussions about alternative sources of energy, a popular topic among the back-to-the-land-movement, especially {{during the time of the}} 1970s energy crisis. The Farm's ham radio operators also used CB radios, as the cost of CB transceivers had dropped impressively during the mid-1970s. CB radios were widely adopted by The Farm for mobile general purpose local communications during this time, while CB radio was starting to become a nationwide craze. This eventually led to the writing of the book The Big Dummy's Guide to CB Radio, which became a non-fiction bestseller. The popularity and sales of The Big Dummy's Guide To CB Radio fueled the launch of the Book Publishing Company's new printing presses, and provided much-needed income for The Farm at a crucial time in its growth. Later, The Farm's medical and security communications utilized VHF FM handheld two-way radios.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Recombinant {{proteins}} {{are usually}} required in laboratories {{interested in the}} protein {{but not in the}} production process itself. Thus, technical equipment which is easy to handle and straight forward protein production procedures are of great benefit to those laboratories. Companies selling single use cultivation bags and bioreactors are trying to satisfy at least part of these needs. However, single-use systems can contribute to major costs which might be acceptable when “good manufacturing practices” are required but not acceptable for most laboratories facing tight funding. Results The assembly and application of a simple self-made “smart sustainable bottle” (<b>SSB)</b> <b>system</b> for E. coli based protein production is presented. The core of the <b>SSB</b> <b>system</b> is a 2 -L glass bottle which is operated at constant temperature, air flow, and stirrer speed without measurement and control of pH and dissolved oxygen. Oxygen transfer capacities are in the range as in conventional bioreactors operated at intermediate aeration rates and by far exceed those found in conventional shaking flasks and disposable bioreactors.

40|$|Abstract Background Venous leg ulcers, {{affecting}} approximately 1 % of the population, are {{costly to}} manage due to poor healing and high recurrence rates. We evaluated an evidence-informed leg ulcer care protocol with two frequently used high compression systems: ‘four-layer bandage’ (4 LB) and ‘short-stretch bandage’ (SSB). Methods We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using individual patient {{data from the}} Canadian Bandaging Trial, a publicly funded, pragmatic, randomized trial evaluating high compression therapy with 4 LB (n[*]=[*] 215) and SSB (n[*]=[*] 209) for community care of venous leg ulcers. We estimated costs (in 2009 – 2010 Canadian dollars) from the societal perspective and used a time horizon corresponding to each trial participant’s first year. Results Relative to SSB, 4 LB was associated with an average 15 ulcer-free days gained, although the 95 % confidence interval [− 32, 21 days] crossed zero, indicating no treatment difference; an average health benefit of 0. 009 QALYs gained [− 0. 019, 0. 037] and overall, an average cost increase of $ 420 [$ 235, $ 739] (due to twice as many 4 LB bandages used); or equivalently, a cost of $ 46, 667 per QALY gained. If decision makers {{are willing to pay}} from $ 50, 000 to $ 100, 000 per QALY, the probability of 4 LB being more cost effective increased from 51 % to 63 %. Conclusions Our findings differ from the emerging clinical and economic evidence that supports high compression therapy with 4 LB, and therefore suggest another perspective on high compression practice, namely when delivered by trained registered nurses using an evidence-informed protocol, both 4 LB and <b>SSB</b> <b>systems</b> offer comparable effectiveness and value for money.

40|$|The paper {{combines}} two topics {{belonging to}} the general theme of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (<b>SSB)</b> in <b>systems</b> including two basic competing ingredients: the self-focusing cubic nonlinearity and a double-well-potential (DWP) structure. Such systems find diverse physical realizations, chiefly in optical waveguides, made of a nonlinear material and featuring a transverse DWP structure, and in models of atomic BEC with attractive inter-atomic interactions, loaded {{into a pair of}} symmetric potential wells coupled by tunneling across the separating barrier. With the increase of the nonlinearity strength, the SSB occurs at a critical value of the strength. The first part of the paper offers a brief overview of the topic. The second part presents a model which is designed as the simplest one capable to produce the SSB phenomenology in the one-dimensional geometry. The model is based on the DWP built as an infinitely deep potential box, which is split into two wells by a delta-functional barrier at the central point. Approximate analytical predictions for the SSB are produced for two limit cases: strong (deep) or weak (shallow) splitting of the potential box by the central barrier. Critical values of the strength of the nonlinearity at the SSB point, represented by the norm of the stationary wave field, are found in both cases (the critical strength is small in the former case, and large in the latter one). For the intermediate case, a less accurate variational approximation (VA) is developed.

For the study interface pressure (3 cm ø probe was {{placed at the}} anatomical B 1 point) was recorded on application of the compression systems every 15 min for 4 h, in supine, standing, while sitting and during walking.

The evaluated systems were: short stretch bandage <b>system</b> (<b>SSB)</b> Rosidal sys (Lohmann & Rauscher, Rengsdorf, Germany), multi-layer bandaging (LSB) Profore (Smith & Nephew, Hull, UK), varistretch bandage (VSB) Proguide (Smith & Nephew) and tubular compression (CS) Rosidal mobil (Lohmann & Rauscher).

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{building}} blocks in a direct-conversion receiver is the low noise amplifier (LNA), which needs to provide a sufficient gain with a low noise figure for the RF front-end. However, the wideband nature of the receiver imposes harsh requirements on the LNA. It is difficult to achieve desired performance goals over the wide frequency range without excessive power consumption. To deal with this problem, this thesis proposes a novel band-selective UWB LNA. Utilizing the frequency hopping property of the MB-OFDM system, the proposed method switches the operating frequency of the LNA in real time following the MB-OFDM's hopping pattern so that optimal gain and noise performance can be achieved in each frequency band. Unlike the conventional approach, this LNA {{does not need to}} cover the entire band simultaneously, thus excessive power consumption is avoided. Fabricated in a 0. 18 -mum CMOS process, the proposed LNA achieves a peak power gain of 16 dB and a minimum noise figure of 2. 74 dB at a low power consumption of less than 12 mW. Other challenges in direct-conversion MB-OFDM receivers include ultra-short band switching time and wide LO frequency range. The single-sideband (SSB) generation is an attractive method for a fast-hopping multi-band LO generator. However, it involves LO frequency synthesis in an open-loop architecture, and thus the spurious-tone performance becomes critical in maintaining the LO signal integrity. Since the accuracy of the SSB generation and the spurious-tone power are difficult to control in a high-frequency operation, a 4. 5 -GHz <b>SSB</b> upconverter <b>system</b> was fabricated in a standard 0. 18 -mum CMOS process to investigate its performance against process variation. Some precise quadrature signal generation circuits such as divider and polyphase filter are employed. Experimental results show that the fabricated <b>SSB</b> upconverter <b>system</b> achieves image rejection of higher than 48 dB and spurious-tone suppression of higher than 32 dB. The use of an active downconversion mixer is an alternative to relax the LNA requirements for direct-conversion MB-OFDM UWB receivers. However, its linearity becomes a problem when the bandwidth is ultra wide. In this thesis, the static current bleeding technique is used in the UWB downconversion mixer to improve its linearity. By injecting a DC current to the RF transconductor for linearization, the mixer's transconductance is enhanced while the noise from the LO switches is not affected. As a result, the conversion gain increases and the noise figure improves. Fabricated in a 0. 18 -mum CMOS process, the UWB downconversion mixer achieves a peak conversion gain of 4. 1 dB, a peak IIP 3 of [...] 2. 5 dBm, and a minimum double-sideband (DSB) noise figure of 11. 7 dB at a low power consumption of 6 mW. Ultra-wideband (UWB) is a short-range, high-data-rate communication system for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) based on the IEEE 802. 15. 3 a physical layer standard. The allocated frequency range is from 3. 1 to 10. 6 GHz, in which 14 bands are defined. The first band group, which is assigned to the mandatory Mode 1 devices, consists of three bands. In UWB systems, multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) is the dominant modulation scheme for its high spectral flexibility and its similarity in communication architecture with other existing wireless communication standards, such as IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g and WiMAX. For practical reasons, the direct-conversion architecture is widely considered the best architecture to implement an MB-OFDM UWB receiver, which has advantages of low power consumption and high integration level. Nevertheless, there are some performance limitations in direct-conversion MB-OFDM UWB receivers. In this thesis, some key {{building blocks}} in the RF front-end of the direct-conversion MB-OFDM UWB receivers for use in Mode 1 devices are investigated to overcome such limitations. Tang, Siu Kei.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s RCA Service Corp had the contract for supporting the electronics with a contingent of approx 50 personnel. The RCA personnel operated and maintained the radar equipment. At that time the main computer was a NASA modified 642B mainframe. Supplemental computers were a Univac 1911.

40|$|As the {{available}} bandwidth of optical fibers {{has been almost}} fully exploited, Digital Signal Processing (DSP) comes to rescue and is a critical technology underpinning the next generation advanced fiber-optic systems. Literally, it contributes two principal enforcements with respect to information communication. One is the implementation of spectrally-efficient modulation schemes, {{and the other is}} the guarantee of the recovery of information from the spectrally-efficient optical signals after channel transmission. The dissertation is dedicated to DSP techniques for the advanced fiber-optic systems. It consists of two main research topics. The first topic is about Fast-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) — a variant OFDM scheme whose subcarrier spacing is half of that of conventional OFDM. The second one is about Fresnel transform with the derivation of an interesting discrete Fresnel transform (DFnT), and the proposal of orthogonal chirp-division multiplexing (OCDM), which is fundamentally underlain by the Fresnel transform. In the first part, equalization and signal recovery problems result from the halved subcarrier spacing in both double-sideband (DSB) and single-sideband (<b>SSB)</b> modulated Fast-OFDM <b>systems</b> are studied, respectively. By exploiting the relation between the multiplexing kernels of Fast-OFDM systems and Fourier transform, equalization algorithms are proposed for respective Fast-OFDM systems for information recovery. Detailed analysis is also provided. With the proposed algorithms, the DSB Fast-OFDM was experimentally implemented by intensity-modulation and direct detection in the conventional 1. 55 -μm and the emerging 2 -μm fiber-optic <b>systems,</b> and the <b>SSB</b> Fast-OFDM was first implemented in coherent fiber-optic system with a spectral efficiency of 6 bit/s/Hz at 36 Gbps, for the first time. In the second part, Fresnel transform from optical Fresnel diffraction is studied. The discrete Fresnel transform (DFnT) is derived, as an interesting transformation that would be potentially useful for DSP. Its properties are proved. One of the attractive properties, the convolution-preservation property states that the DFnT of a circular convolution of two sequences is equal to the DFnT of either one convolving with the other. One application of DFnT is practically utilized in the proposal of OCDM. In the OCDM system, a large number of orthogonal chirped waveforms are multiplexed for high-speed communication, achieving the maximum spectral efficiency of chirp spread spectrum systems, {{in the same way as}} OFDM attains the maximum spectral efficiency of frequency-division multiplexing. Owing to the unique time-frequency properties of chirped waveforms, OCDM outperforms OFDM and single-carrier systems, and is more resilient against the noise effect, especially, when time-domain and frequency-domain distortions are severe. Experiments were carried out to validate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed OCDM systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 180 {{patients}} {{participated in the}} study, with 30 withdrawn due to various reasons. At 12 weeks, 76 % patients treated with SSB, 78 % patients treated with 4 LB, and 31 % patients treated with usual care alone had completed ulcer healing. The hazard ratios for healing for 4 LB and SSB relative to the control group were 3. 14 (95 % CI = 1. 74 - 5. 67) and 2. 72 (95 % CI = 1. 53 - 4. 86), respectively. The key findings indicated the significant effects of compression bandaging resulted in {{a higher proportion of}} complete ulcer healing; reduction in ulcer size, pain severity, and pain interference; and improvement in quality of life and lifestyle activity. Across the 12 -week study period, the present study also highlighted the significant improvement of the psychosocial composite outcome among the three study groups. Furthermore, the reduction in pain severity and pain interference accounted for the major contribution to the total effect of the psychosocial composite outcome. Therefore, effective pain control and minimizing the effect of pain on daily life is essential in promoting ulcer healing. It is evident that the application of compression bandaging with either 4 LB or SSB is feasible and more effective than the current usual care with no compression. This study add new knowledge to the psychosocial benefit of compression bandaging for venous ulcer patients living in the community; and support incorporating compression bandaging in the routine venous ulcer care. Further studies are therefore suggested to focus on the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of and the satisfaction and experience of both patients and nurses with compression bandaging using different high compression bandage systems. The study was a randomized controlled trial. Those patients who participated in the experimental groups received compression bandaging with either the 4 LB or SSB along with a local usual care. In contrast, the control group participants received usual care. A 12 -week study intervention was given individually to the study participants. The research outcome of this study was the proportion of complete ulcer healing, ulcer size, pain severity, pain interference, disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life measures, and lifestyle activity. The instruments used include VeV MD stereophotogrammetry, Brief pain Inventory, The SF- 12 Health Survey, Charing Cross Venous Ulcer Questionnaire, and the Frenchay Activity Index. Data analysis involved the use of descriptive statistics and inferential statistics such as survival analysis, one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), multivariate analysis variance (MANOVA), doubly multivariate analysis of variance (Doubly MANOVA), and Roy-Bargman stepdown analysis were used. Venous ulcer is the most serious clinical consequence of chronic venous insufficiency. It is a chronic health problem that afflicts older people as well as health care professions. Its chronicity, together with its high recurrent rate, creates not only a big challenge to nurses' workload and health cost, but it also has a direct impact on patients' physiological and psychosocial well-being. Compression bandaging has been identified as the mainstream form of treatment for venous ulcer in previous literature, although this is not very well known by the nurses in Hong Kong. Previous studies have confirmed that the proportion of complete ulcer healing is improved with high compression as compared to no compression. However, a definite conclusion on the effectiveness of different high compression systems, such as the four-layer compression system (4 LB) and short-stretch compression <b>system</b> (<b>SSB),</b> was not found. Most importantly the treatment impacts on proportion of complete ulcer healing, ulcer size, pain severity and pain interference, health-related quality of life, and lifestyle activities are essential influences on patients' participation in venous ulcer care and treatment choice. These limited data leave a gap in today's knowledge on venous ulcer management in relation to both patients and health care providers. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} examine the effect of two compression bandage systems, the 4 LB and SSB, in promoting ulcer healing in terms of the proportion of complete ulcer healing and ulcer size, as well as the psychosocial well-being including pain, heath-related quality of life, and lifestyle activity for older people in the community.
