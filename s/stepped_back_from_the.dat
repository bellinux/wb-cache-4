5|$|For Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro, the {{opportunity}} to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro {{had been one of}} more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, Mamie Eisenhower, as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former First Lady was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971. Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the Washington quarter.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Morrissey {{auditioned for}} One Summer, a {{television}} series by Willy Russell for Yorkshire Television and Channel 4 about two Liverpool boys who run away to Wales one summer. Russell had been {{attached to the}} Everyman for many years, and Morrissey had seen {{him while he was}} working behind the bar downstairs from the theatre, though the two had never been introduced. Morrissey went to at least eight auditions, and in one read for the part of Icky opposite Paul McGann, who was reading for Billy. McGann, five years older than Morrissey, believed that he was too old to be playing the part of 16-year-old Billy, and <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> production, leaving the role to go to Morrissey. Spencer Leigh got the part of Icky and Ian Hart played the supporting role of Rabbit. Russell had a professional disagreement with the director Gordon Flemyng and producer Keith Richardson over the casting of 18-year-old Morrissey and Leigh; he believed that the sympathy of 16-year-olds running away was lost by casting older actors. Russell subsequently had his name removed from the credits of the original broadcast. After filming One Summer for five months, Morrissey went travelling in Kenya with his cousins. When he returned to Britain, One Summer was being broadcast, and he dealt with the new experience of being recognised in public.|$|E
25|$|The state {{retained}} {{both its}} powers {{and its role}} in the rural economy in the 1980s. Decollectivization, like the collectivization of the 1950s, was directed from the top down. Sometimes, apparently, it was imposed on communities that had been content with their collective methods. But in permitting households and communities greater leeway to decide what to produce and in allowing the growth of rural markets and small-scale industries, the state <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> close supervision and mandatory quotas of the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

25|$|The police {{violence}} {{sparked a}} show of support from other unions and a one-day strike of transport workers. Each side <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> confrontation: Chief Johannes and Mayor Bainbridge faced calls for their impeachment, while the union continued to urge its members not to give the police any justification for further attacks, disarming a number of picketers who wanted to return fire with fire. The union did not make any overt efforts to stop those few trucks accompanied by convoys of forty police cars apiece that tried to deliver goods, but sent so many cars with pickets to accompany those convoys {{that the police were}} never able to shepherd more than a few delivery trucks on any given day.|$|E
25|$|Flavio Briatore's {{future as}} QPR {{chairman}} came into question in September 2009 {{after he left}} the Renault F1 team in the midst of race fixing allegations. The Football League board discussed the matter on 8 October 2009 and declared that they would be awaiting a response from Briatore to various questions before commenting further. Meanwhile, the club continued to make losses (£18.8m in 2008–09 and £13.7m 2009–10). Briatore sold his 62% share to Ecclestone in December 2010, with the Italian possibly retaining a right of first refusal should Ecclestone sell, and initially <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> day-to-day running of the business in favour of Amit Bhatia and Ishan Saksena, the company chairman and managing director respectively. However, his involvement gradually returned, and conflicts between Briatore {{on the one hand and}} Bhatia and Saksena on the other resulted in both Bhatia and Saksena leaving QPR in May 2011.|$|E
500|$|Schulz {{recalled}} {{that the first}} time he <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> line on defense, Coach Yost was horrified. [...] Yost said, [...] "Dutchman, {{what are you trying to}} do?" [...] "Stop 'em", replied Schulz. [...] "But you're supposed to play in the line", Yost insisted. [...] "They'll run over us." [...] "Listen Yost", Schulz claims to have said, [...] "My way is best. [...] If any of 'em gets by me, I'll move back into the line and stay there". [...] Yost eventually saw the wisdom in Schulz's technique, and soon nearly all centers were backing up the line on defense.|$|E

500|$|During the 1860s, Claflin {{remained}} {{active at}} high levels of party politics, gaining appointment to [...] the national executive committee of the Republican Party in 1864. [...] In that role, he was a critical mediating force between radical and conservative factions of the party, promoting the moderate Schuyler Colfax for vice president under Ulysses S. Grant in the 1868 election. [...] In 1868 he was elected {{chairman of the national}} party. [...] He reluctantly promoted Grant for president in the 1872 election, unhappy that Grant had given patronage power in Massachusetts to the controversial ex-general Benjamin Butler. [...] He <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> chairmanship when Henry Wilson received the vice presidential nomination.|$|E
500|$|... "The Trouble with Tribbles" [...] was {{originally}} intended to have a follow-up episode during season three, but after Gene Roddenberry <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> production of the show after a time-slot change and further cuts in the budget, the idea was scrapped. In 1973, Gerrold had become friends with D. C. Fontana from their time spent on the Star Trek convention circuit together. He had heard about Star Trek: The Animated Series, and offered to do an episode. Fontana responded that she wanted the tribble episode that was cut from season three. [...] This episode was entitled [...] "More Tribbles, More Troubles". The episode introduces the natural predator of the tribbles and genetically engineered tribbles which no longer reproduce but instead grow much larger. As with his other Animated Series episode [...] "", he later explained that almost nothing was cut from the original pitches for the third season of The Original Series as animation played out quicker and so everything still fit into the episode despite the reduced running time. Both of Gerrold's Animated Series episodes were novelised by Alan Dean Foster, and Gerrold later said {{that he thought that}} he did [...] "a fine job".|$|E

2500|$|The {{schematic}} {{designs for}} the new Kimbell building were made public in November 2008, and the plans were released in May 2010. [...] The 85,000 square foot (7,900 m²) structure will complement the original building but not mimic it. [...] Unlike the original, its lines will be rectilinear, not curvilinear. [...] Like the original, however, it will have three bays with the middle bay <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other two. The new building expansion, named the Renzo Piano Pavilion, was officially inaugurated to the public on November 27, 2013.|$|E
2500|$|With Parliament opened, and the King safely back in Buckingham House, serious {{questions}} {{started to be}} asked about {{the exact nature of}} Rochford's 'emergency.' [...] In the Cabinet he was increasingly isolated, as his fellow ministers <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> whole affair in an attempt to minimise the political damage. [...] Finally, on November 7, the hapless minister resigned for reasons of 'ill health.' [...] Soon after Sayre was released, all charges against him having been dropped, and the bail returned. [...] He then began his counter-attack, commencing legal action against the former minister. [...] In the end, though the law was on his side, the action came to nothing, because the escalation of the war in North America turned Sayre from a defender of liberty, in the mould of John Wilkes, into an enemy alien.|$|E
