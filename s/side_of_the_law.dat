5|$|In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly {{joined the}} losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started, and only {{narrowly}} escaped death. He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, {{he felt he had}} to join a faction as a hired gun, although it put him on the wrong <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> In between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse. Even after his faction admitted defeat (the feud would begin again years later), Burnham still had many enemies.|$|E

25|$|Her mother threw Rita out of {{the house}} when she found out that her {{daughter}} was collaborating with the police.

Borsellino became her lifeline.|$|E

His first mission is to {{investigate}} a crime ring called the Angels of Doom, which specializes in (among other things) helping convicted felons escape police dragnets and ambushes. The Angels of Doom is run by Jill Trelawney, a young woman who is willing to condone just about any action—including the murder of The Saint, if needs be—in her quest to wreak havoc on Scotland Yard, which she blames for the death of her father. But Templar, in his pursuit of Trelawney, finds within her an unexpected kindred spirit.|$|E
25|$|The major {{characters}} of the first season were divided between those on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and those involved in drug-related crime. The starring cast comprised characters from both groups. The investigating detail was launched {{by the actions of}} Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), whose insubordinate tendencies and personal problems overshadowed his ability. The detail was led by Lieutenant Cedric Daniels (Lance Reddick) who faced challenges balancing his career aspirations with his desire to produce a good case. Kima Greggs (Sonja Sohn) was a capable lead detective who faced jealousy from colleagues and worry about the dangers of her job from her domestic partner. Her investigative work was greatly helped by her confidential informant, a drug addict known as Bubbles (Andre Royo).|$|E

He {{sees himself}} on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> but his {{draconian}} means do not justify his actions, putting him at odds with Tarzan. He acts as judge and executioner, and has made it his goal to hunt down Hugo and Hooft because they refused his order to burn down a village full of women and children. Tarzan helped fake their demise, but eventually the Colonel learned the truth and imprisoned them. Tarzan ended up imprisoned in Fort Doom as well, then after allowing Hugo and Hoof to escape, {{he was sentenced to}} be hanged, but was released after Renard impersonated a French magistrate, which Staquait doesn't notice as the heroes safely returned to Africa by steamship.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Carmel {{moves to}} the Square, her brother Darren (Gary McDonald) and his children, Junior (Aaron Carrington) and Aisha (Aisha Jacob), join her. Darren and Carmel are {{complete}} opposite of each other; Darren is inconsiderate and often dabbles on the wrong <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> with dodgy scams, such as porn video laundering and instigating a counterfeit money ring. Carmel despairs over his thoughtless behaviour and criminal antics, but he ignores her and she regularly takes over caring for his two young children. Junior proves to be troublesome, and after Carmel discovers {{that he has been}} playing truant from school for some time, she reports Darren to the truancy officer as an irresponsible parent. This does not please Darren and he is even more annoyed when Carmel refuses flatly to put up with his behaviour any longer. Animosity between the two increases when Carmel starts dating Matthew Jackson (Steven Hartley) later that year; Darren is unhappy about his sister dating a white man. Carmel defends Matthew against her brother's racism, and after Darren cons Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), she throws him out. Darren then leaves alone, leaving his children so Carmel sends them to her parents as she only has a one bedroom flat.|$|E
25|$|In April 1917, Thompson {{decided to}} leave Lakeview to join a private law firm in Portland. He became {{a partner in the}} legal firm of Snow, McCamant, and Bronaugh, {{replacing}} Wallace McCamantm who had just been appointed to the Oregon Supreme Court. When Thompson arrived in Portland, the firm was renamed Snow, Bronaugh, and Thompson. Later, when McCamant left the Supreme Court and returned to the practice, the firm was renamed McCamant, Bronaugh, and Thompson. Eventually, the firm became McCamant and Thompson. Over the years in Portland, Thompson handled many high-profile cases, becoming one of Oregon's most prominent trial attorneys. While many of his clients were big corporations, including Portland shipyards and steel companies and large lumber and natural resources companies throughout the Pacific Northwest, he also defended individuals facing criminal charges. For example, he defended a wealthy individual for violating Oregon's Prohibition law in 1918. A year later, he defended an individual against cattle rustling charges in eastern Oregon. On the civil <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> Thompson sued six residents of Toledo, Oregon, on behalf of Japanese labors employed by the Pacific Spruce Company, who were driven out of town by a mob of white residents. He also handled the probate for Bernard Daly's substantial estate, which was used to establish the Bernard Daly Educational Fund to provide college scholarships for Lake County students. In 1926, he was elected president of the Oregon State Bar Association.|$|E

500|$|After soccer practice, eight-year-old {{aspiring}} filmmaker Brendon Small {{shows his}} mother Paula a self-made trailer for his upcoming film, The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law,</b> a crime {{film about a}} rogue police detective. Paula expresses indifference to the production. At breakfast the next morning, Paula informs Brendon she plans {{to go on a}} date that night with Brendon's soccer coach, John McGuirk, much to Brendon's chagrin. Brendon seeks advice from his friend Melissa and her father Erik, but they are unable to advise him as they are late for a violin recital.|$|E

500|$|The major {{characters}} of the first season were divided between those on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and those involved in drug-related crime. The investigating detail was launched {{by the actions of}} Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), whose insubordinate tendencies and personal problems played counterpoint to his ability as a criminal investigator. The detail was led by Lieutenant Cedric Daniels (Lance Reddick) who faced challenges balancing his career aspirations with his desire to produce a good case. Kima Greggs (Sonja Sohn) was a capable lead detective who faced jealousy from colleagues and worry about the dangers of her job from her domestic partner. Her investigative work was greatly helped by her confidential informant, a drug addict known as Bubbles (Andre Royo). Like Greggs, partners Thomas [...] "Herc" [...] Hauk (Domenick Lombardozzi) and Ellis Carver (Seth Gilliam) were reassigned to the detail from the narcotics unit. The duo's initially violent nature was eventually subdued as they proved useful in grunt work, and sometimes served as comic relief for the audience. Rounding out the temporary unit were detectives Lester Freamon (Clarke Peters) and Roland [...] "Prez" [...] Pryzbylewski (Jim True-Frost). Though not initially important players in the operation, Freamon proved a quietly capable and methodical investigator with a knack for noticing tiny but important details, and Prez {{turned out to be a}} natural at following paper trails and his persistence when dealing with seemingly unbreakable codes paid off eventually.|$|E

Although, he admits he has a [...] "lost a step" [...] to his father, not remembering when he has beaten David or Colby in a sprint, he is quick enough to kill his old, tough FBI pal Pete [...] "Petey" [...] Fox, who is an expert in a gunfight and has fallen to the wrong <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> He grieves the loss of his adrenaline-chasing friend.
