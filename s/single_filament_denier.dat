Collective properties of multiple bio-filaments (actin or microtubules) undergoing hydrolysis {{have not been}} studied extensively earlier within simple theoretical frameworks. In this paper, we study the collective dynamical properties of multiple filaments under force, and demonstrate the distinct properties of a multi-filament system in comparison to a <b>single</b> <b>filament.</b> Comparing stochastic simulation results with recent experimental data, we show that multi-filament collective catastrophes are slower than catastrophes of <b>single</b> <b>filaments.</b> Our study also shows further distinctions as follows: (i) force-dependence of the cap-size distribution of multiple filaments are quantitatively {{different from that of}} <b>single</b> <b>filaments,</b> (ii) the diffusion constant associated with the system length fluctuations is distinct for multiple filaments, and (iii) switching dynamics of multiple filaments between capped and uncapped states and the fluctuations therein are also distinct. We build a unified picture by establishing interconnections among all these collective phenomena. Additionally, we show that the collapse times during catastrophes can be sharp indicators of collective stall forces exceeding the additive contributions of <b>single</b> <b>filaments...</b>|$|R

The four F 1 hybrid combinations generated using Daba, Jata and Raily tasar ecoraces of seed crop rearing season (July-August) were evaluated during commercial crop season of 2007 and 2008 for the influence of hybridization as positive heterosis in the traits of economically important silk productivity and <b>filament</b> <b>denier.</b> The F 1 hybrid, Daba x Jata has recorded positive heterosis in single shell weight (+ 25. 6 %), total silk yield (+ 79. 0 %) and silk filament length (+ 68. 1 %), but for silk <b>filament</b> of high <b>denier</b> (11. 98 d) followed by its reciprocal hybrid, JataxDaba in shell weight (+ 18. 8 %), silk yield (+ 68. 1 %), filament length (+ 63. 8 %) and <b>filament</b> of highest <b>denier</b> (12. 32 d). Though, the RailyxDaba hybrid could show highest heterosis in shell weight (2. 47 g) with <b>filament</b> of least <b>denier</b> (10. 86 d), the improvement in filament length was marginal (+ 44. 7 %) and heterosis in silk yield was negative (- 47. 0 %), while the performance of DabaxRaily hybrid was least among the hybrids.

40|$|Kevlar {{materials}} offer excellent tensile {{and thermal}} properties but can rapidly degrade under exposure to {{hot and humid}} environmental conditions. Currently Kevlar fiber's survival probability comes from a <b>single</b> <b>filament</b> test. Unfortunately, the <b>single</b> <b>filament</b> test is a tedious process and prone to operator bias, leading to inaccurate survival function that does not represent the actual survival function. This research aims to validate the fiber bundle test to replace the <b>single</b> <b>filament</b> test in extracting Kevlar?s survival function. Another important aspect is determining the factors that cause the fiber to lose its properties. This research also aims to determine the factors that degrade Kevlar fibers and those factors? combined effects on degrading the KM 2 fiber. This information is essential for safety factor design when exposure to these environmental factors would cause the Kevlar KM 2 to fail prematurely. Results from experimental data and analysis indicate that the fiber bundle test is a good replacement for <b>single</b> <b>filament</b> tests and estimation techniques can determine the bundle Weibull parameters. Furthermore, the survival function for treated fibers is better if the bundle is lubricated. The accelerated aging experiments show that accelerated aging is possible with combined temperature and moisture. Kevlar KM 2 bundle conditioned at 270 ?C and 150 g water for 3 hours lost over 95 % of its breaking strength.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Arguments are {{put forward}} thatmean inextensibility {{is a valid}} {{approximation}} for semiflexible filaments. Usingmean inextensibility, a simple analytical expression for the free energy for <b>single</b> <b>filaments</b> {{as a function of}} their end-to-end separation is obtained. This expression contains a term that explicitly represents the internal energy of the filament as well as nonzero temperature effects. Using this free energy, the force-extension relationships of semiflexible filaments and the corresponding nonlinear elasticity of their networks are investigated. Accounting for finite longitudinal compliance of filaments, we identify three distinct scaling regimes in the effective modulus of both <b>single</b> <b>filaments</b> and networks. We find the explicit expressions for crossovers between these scaling regimes; dramatic nonlinear elasticity will only be observed if there is a wide separation between the two crossovers. 1...|$|R

40|$|Myosin X is a {{molecular}} motor that {{is adapted to}} select bundled actin <b>filaments</b> over <b>single</b> actin <b>filaments</b> for processive motility. Its unique form of motility suggests that myosin X's stepping mechanism {{takes advantage of the}} arrangement of actin filaments and the additional target binding sites found within a bundle. Here we use fluorescence imaging with one-nanometer accuracy to show that myosin X takes steps of â¼ 18 nm along a fascin-actin bundle. This step-size is well short of the 36 -nm step-size observed in myosin V and myosin VI that corresponds to the actin pseudohelical repeat distance. Myosin X is able to walk along bundles with this step-size if it straddles two actin filaments, but would be quickly forced to spiral into theÂ constrained interior of the bundle if it were to use only a <b>single</b> actin <b>filament.</b> We also demonstrate that myosin X takes many sideways steps as it walks along a bundle, suggesting that it can switch actin filament pairs within the bundle as it walks. Sideways steps to the left or the right occur on bundles with equal frequency, suggesting a degree of lateral flexibility such thatÂ the motor's working stroke does not bias it to the left or to the right. On <b>single</b> actin <b>filaments,</b> we find a broad mixture of 10 â 20 -nm steps, which again falls short of the 36 -nm actin repeat. Moreover, the motor leans to the right as it walks along <b>single</b> <b>filaments,</b> which may require myosin X to adopt strained configurations. As a control, we also tracked myosin V stepping along actin filaments and fascin-actin bundles. We find that myosin V follows a narrower path on both structures, walking primarily along one surface of an actin filament and following a <b>single</b> <b>filament</b> within a bundle while occasionally switching to neighboring filaments. Together, these results delineate some of the structural features of the motor and the track that allow myosin X to recognize actin filament bundles...|$|R

From these three images, the confocal data {{is not able to}} confirm the AFM data while the STED image exhibits every <b>single</b> <b>filament</b> within the meshwork. The single force curves can now be investigated further in order to extract the Youngâs modulus which gives information about elasticity of the sample. Since part of the cell cytoskeleton is investigated here, the Youngâs moduli map should feature the corresponding stiffer parts of the cell. This additional study of the force curves bearing details of the cell elasticity is overlaid with all before-mentioned imaging modes in Figure 3 c- 3 f. The maps for the Youngâs moduli (f), the STED (e) and confocal data (d) are displayed in perspective according to the 3 D rendered height information (c). Evidently, the Youngâs moduli map matches with the data extracted from the height analysis and the STED image. The number of the microtubles in the bundle extracted from the STED image can be estimated as three to five since they are clearly distinguished {{from the rest of the}} cell area. The two <b>single</b> <b>filaments</b> branching off that bundle, optically visible only with STED, are also traceable in the Youngâs moduli map of limited contrast by the membrane stiffness variations over the cytoskelton.
