40|$|The {{ability to}} form a raised three {{dimensional}} image makes possible the use of modified processes, inks and substrates in fine art work, such as childrenâ€™s books, business cards, postcards, and special type printing processes. If the raised image attains the required height and firmness, {{it can be used}} in printing of Braille characters. Production of three dimensional (3 D) images on a substrate can be accomplished by old fashioned embossing procedures, a process using hectographic or <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicating</b> masters, or raised Xerographic printing with thermally intumesced electroscopic powders. It may also be done employing three-dimensional imaging paper with randomly distributed fibers with uniformly dispersed unexpanded synthetic thermoplastic polymeric microspheres, thermographic processes, special printing processes, which work by building parts of light curable photo-polymer in layers, or heat transfer printing with thermally-expandable ink layer. Results from our laboratory show a modified formula of hot melt ink {{that can be used in}} 3 D thermal wax printing process to create raised images on the substrates. An extensive study of thermal behavior of the components of proposed phase change ink has been carried out...|$|E
5000|$|Compared to spirit duplication, {{mimeography}} {{produced a}} darker, more legible image. <b>Spirit</b> <b>duplicated</b> images were usually tinted a light purple or lavender, which gradually became lighter {{over the course}} of some dozens of copies. Mimeography was often considered [...] "the next step up" [...] in quality, capable of producing hundreds of copies. Print runs beyond that level were usually produced by professional printers, or as the technology became available, xerographic copiers.|$|R
50|$|Mimeographed images {{generally}} have much better durability than <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicated</b> images, since the inks are {{more resistant to}} ultraviolet light. The primary preservation challenge is the low-quality paper often used, which would yellow and degrade due to residual acid in the treated pulp from which the paper was made. In the worst case, old copies can crumble into small particles when handled. Mimeographed copies have moderate durability when acid-free paper is used.|$|R
