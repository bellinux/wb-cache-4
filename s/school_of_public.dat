40|$|There {{is a broad}} {{consensus}} {{on the need for}} high-quality public health education and research to tackle the world’s many public health challenges. Public health education and research are delivered by a variety of institutions operating very different models, which collectively can be called <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health. Given the importance of education and research to public health systems, it is surprising how little research has been done to assess the role <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health in contributing to population health. In particular, it is notable there has been very little research on {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the different models <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health that have evolved over the last 100 years. Thus, a historical perspective is crucial. To date most historical work has focused on US <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health. Although the evidence is patchy, a global overview of the history <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health identifies three important themes: capacity building, multidisciplinarity and balancing teaching and research. Newer challenges and opportunities include addressing the impact of climate change and developments in e-learning. <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health have the potential to make a central contribution to progress in public health practice in the twenty-first century...|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} non-governmental {{community has}} {{played a major role}} in developing <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health and continues to do so. Nearly a century ago, seminal investments of the Rockefeller Foundation played a pivotal role in developing <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health in North America and several abroad. Today, involvement of non-governmental organizations in continuing development <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health is needed, as many countries throughout the world continue to battle the burden of disease with insufficient numbers and quality <b>of</b> trained <b>public</b> health workers. In this paper we discuss in particular the roles of the Open Society Institute working together with the Association <b>of</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Health in the European Region to foster the development <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health in formerly socialist countries. We describe the development process in three example countries (Ukraine, Lithuania, and Macedonia), along with the difficulties they have faced. Government support and accreditation processes are needed to sustain the efforts to launch new <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health and to ensure their quality. The lessons learned in these initiatives are relevant to future development <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health education to provide the workforce required to address needs <b>of</b> professional <b>public</b> health in the 21 st century...|$|R

40|$|The {{dramatic}} changes in the field <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health are reverberating in <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health in a number of ways, {{not the least of which}} is action by the deans of the Association <b>of</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Health (ASPH) to ensure that graduates with master's <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health degrees are competent to meet the current challenges of practice. The conceptual framework at the center of this activity describes 3 domains [...] skills, perspectives, and applications [...] in which alumni <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health may be required to demonstrate competency. ASPH work in this area is grounded in previous national and professional competency definitions and school- and department-specific competency development; it is distinct from earlier work, however, because its focus is on competency at the master's level across the graduate <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health...|$|R
