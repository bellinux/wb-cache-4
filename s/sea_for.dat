5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to Allied shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was unable to put to <b>sea</b> <b>for</b> crew training due {{to the threat of}} Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were unable to move the battleship between anchorages to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E
5|$|Endeavour {{was paid}} off in September 1774, and in March 1775 was sold by the Navy to {{shipping}} magnate J. Mather for £645. Mather returned her to <b>sea</b> <b>for</b> at least one commercial voyage to Archangel in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Impalement of pirates, {{rather than}} highway robbers, is also {{occasionally}} recorded. In October 1767, for example, Hassan Bey, who had preyed on Turkish {{ships in the}} Euxine <b>Sea</b> <b>for</b> a number of years, was captured and impaled, {{even though he had}} offered 500,000 ducats for his pardon.|$|E

5|$|Use of the <b>sea</b> <b>for</b> leisure {{developed}} {{in the nineteenth century}} and became a significant industry in the twentieth century. Maritime leisure activities are varied and include self-organized trips cruising, yachting, powerboat racing and fishing; commercially organized voyages on cruise ships; and trips on smaller vessels for ecotourism such as whale watching and coastal birdwatching.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Italo-Turkish War in September 1911, Piemonte was stationed in the Red Sea with four other cruisers. In December, she and the other cruisers patrolled the Ottoman ports in the Red <b>Sea</b> <b>for</b> ships that might be preparing to carry a rumored invasion force across the narrow sea to Italian Eritrea. Hostilities were temporarily ceased while the British King George V passed through the Red Sea following his coronation ceremony in Indiathe ceasefire lasted until 26 November.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} great size, supertankers often cannot enter port fully loaded. These ships {{can take on}} their cargo at {{off-shore}} platforms and single-point moorings. On {{the other end of}} the journey, they often pump their cargo off to smaller tankers at designated lightering points off-coast. A supertanker's routes are generally long, requiring it to stay at <b>sea</b> <b>for</b> extended periods, up to and beyond seventy days at a time.|$|E
5|$|Chevron Corporation and Shell Oil Company {{evacuated}} offshore crews {{from the}} Gulf of Mexico on September16 {{in preparation for}} a possible hurricane threat from Hurricane Gordon, even though there was little effect on oil and gas production before that day. The Chevron Corporation expected the number of people working in the Gulf to reduce from 1,700on September16 to 450the next day. Gordon also forced the cruise liner Carnival Sensation, consisting of 2,200passengers and 900crew members, to remain at <b>sea</b> <b>for</b> one day. Residents in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana were also advised by radio {{to keep track of the}} approaching hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Despite his ongoing {{research}} in Guiana, what Beebe desired most was {{to return to}} the Galápagos, this time with a properly fitted-out scientific research vessel that possessed the ability to dredge animals from beneath the ocean. In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Galápagos expedition, backed by Williams and several other donors. His ship for this expedition was the Arcturus, a steam yacht considerably larger than the Noma that was capable of being at <b>sea</b> <b>for</b> extended periods of time. The Arcturus was outfitted with Beebe's pulpit and boom walk from the Noma, as well as cages and tanks for live animals, chemicals and vials to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals they hoped to encounter.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the repair}} work, Westfalen briefly {{went into the}} Baltic <b>Sea</b> <b>for</b> training, before {{returning}} to the North Sea on 4 October. The fleet then advanced as far as the Dogger Bank on 19–20 October. The ship remained in port for the majority of 1917. The ship did not actively take part in Operation Albion in the Baltic, though she was stationed off Apenrade to prevent a possible British incursion into the area.|$|E
5|$|From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk {{companion}} set {{out across}} the frozen <b>sea</b> <b>for</b> the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Gielgud {{continued}} to try, without much success, {{to find new}} plays that suited him as an actor, but his direction of Peter Shaffer's first play, Five Finger Exercise (1958), received acclaim. While in the US for the Shaffer play, Gielgud revived Much Ado About Nothing, this time with Margaret Leighton as his Beatrice. Most of the New York critics praised the production, and they all praised the co-stars. He gave his first performances on television during 1959, in Rattigan's The Browning Version for CBS and N C Hunter's A Day by the <b>Sea</b> <b>for</b> ITV. He appeared in more than fifty more plays on television {{over the next four}} decades.|$|E

After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she was used to lay defensive minefields off the German coast. She was thereafter used to escort offensive mine-layers in the North Sea until she was torpedoed by a British submarine in December 1939. She was thereafter used as a training ship in the Baltic <b>Sea</b> <b>for</b> {{most of the rest of}} the war, apart from a short deployment to Norway from November 1942 to April 1943. In January 1945, she was assigned to mine-laying duties in the Skaggerak, but severe shortages of fuel permitted only one such operation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tales}} {{and beliefs of}} the Siberian Yupik people, killer whales are said to appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as killer whales in summer. Killer whales are {{believed}} to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco are strewn into the <b>sea</b> <b>for</b> them. Killer whales were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to {{allow themselves to be}} killed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} {{following the end of}} the Great War, the United States, Britain, and Japan all launched huge naval construction programs. All three countries decided that a new naval arms race would be ill-advised, and so convened the Washington Naval Conference to discuss arms limitations, which produced the Washington Naval Treaty, signed in February 1922. Under the terms of Article II of the treaty, Michigan and her sister South Carolina were to be scrapped. Michigan put to <b>sea</b> <b>for</b> the last time on 31 August, bound for the breaker's yard in Philadelphia. She arrived there on 1 September and was decommissioned on 11 February 1923. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 November and broken up for scrap the following year.|$|E

The Tawau marine zone are one of Sabah four marine zones, with the other been in Sandakan, Kudat and the west coast. A great variety of high-grade fishes and all kinds of crustaceans were found in abundance in the sea and waterways around Tawau. Prawn farming has become largest sea economic source for the district. The oldest and largest prawn farm were located in this area together with six frozen shrimp processing plants.|$|E
5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, males {{migrate to the}} northern ends of the species range to feed, while females forage near {{the breeding}} rookeries. Sea lions can stay at <b>sea</b> <b>for</b> as long as two weeks at a time. They make continuous dives, returning to the surface to rest. Sea lions may travel alone or in groups while at sea and haul-out between each sea trip. Adult females and juveniles molt in autumn and winter; adult males molt in January and February. Gulf of California sea lions do not migrate; they stay in the Gulf year-round.|$|E
5|$|Over 3 million {{vessels are}} {{employed}} in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at <b>sea</b> <b>for</b> weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines.
