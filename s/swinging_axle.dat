50|$|For 1969, {{the only}} {{exterior}} change was the {{fuel filler flap}} {{no longer had a}} finger indentation due to a new interior-mounted fuel door release. For North America, the Beetle received a heated rear window, day/night mirror and the semi-trailing, independent suspension with double jointed <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> as standard equipment. In other markets, manual transmission models retained a <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> independent suspension which would continue until the end of German Beetle production.|$|R
50|$|Suspension was by <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> in {{the rear}} and MacPherson {{suspension}} in the front. Coil springs were used with hydraulic telescopic shock absorbers.|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this diploma thesis is to design a <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> of a truck for 4 x 4 chassis without wheel {{reduction}} gears. The study consist of two parts. The first part contains designs of main parts of the axle, mechanism of suspension and steering. The second part contains the gears housing stress analysis using the finite element method. The housing of gears is {{the arm of the}} <b>swing</b> <b>axle,</b> which is {{the main part of the}} chassis...|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} {{was changed}} from the 44's transverse leaf spring setup to longitudinally mounted torsion bars. At the rear the 44's <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> Variomatic layout was retained.|$|R
5000|$|The design's origin {{lies with}} William Stout's 1932 Stout Scarab. This rear-engined car used <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> {{independent}} rear suspension, with long near-vertical coilover struts from high mounting {{points on the}} space frame chassis. Stout had also been an aircraft designer and considered that the long-travel oleo struts made, [...] 'the airplane landing gear is the easiest type of running gear for comfort yet devised.' [...] The lower ends of the struts were attached to the <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> casings by swivel bushes. Forward radius rods handled the longitudinal forces.|$|R
5000|$|Single-pivot point: Mercedes-Benz {{addressed}} the handling issues by producing <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> with a single-pivot point located under the differential, thus {{well below the}} axle. This configuration markedly reduced the tendency to [...] "jack-up" [...] and the later low pivot swing-axle equipped cars were praised in contemporary publications for their handling. The low-pivot swing-axle remained in production with Mercedes-Benz W108 280SE and 300SEL until 1972. It was fitted to the 300SEL 6.3, which was during the early 70s the worlds fastest production sedan. AMG-modified 6.3s were also raced with the stock <b>swing</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Front {{suspension}} must {{be either}} Volkswagen Type 1, 181 ball joint or link pin only. Rear suspension {{is based on}} Volkswagen Type 1 independent rear suspension or <b>swing</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
50|$|This was {{the first}} Mercedes-Benz to use an {{independent}} suspension setup, with a double wishbone front <b>axle,</b> double-joint <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> at the rear, and separate wheel location, coil springs and damping.|$|R
50|$|The W24’s {{structural}} basis was a {{box frame}} chassis. At the back it employed a <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> arrangement copied {{from the popular}} small cars produced by sister brand DKW of Auto Union.|$|R
25|$|A-arm {{suspension}} (short upper arm, long lower arm) with coils {{was used}} at the front and <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> suspension with semi-trailing arms, Panhard rods and a transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring was {{used at the}} rear.|$|R
50|$|The Country Buggy {{was based}} on an Australian-made Type 1 {{platform}} with engine, gearbox and front axle from the Type 1. The rear <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> had reduction gears from a 1st generation Volkswagen Transporter (1950-1967).|$|R
5000|$|Anti-roll bar: As {{a design}} option, a front {{anti-roll}} bar which can ameliorate the <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> car's handling [...] - [...] shifting weight {{transfer to the}} front outboard tire, considerably reducing rear slip angles—thereby avoiding potential oversteer.|$|R
2500|$|The Corvair second {{generation}} arrived for model year 1965, {{noted for its}} lack of a [...] "B" [...] pillar and a new fully independent suspension replacing the original <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> rear suspension. [...] The Corvair used coil springs at each wheel.|$|R
50|$|The Hillman Imp {{designers}} {{learned from}} {{the problems with the}} Corvair, having crashed one at a relatively low speed, and designed their rear-engined car with semi-trailing arm suspension at the rear. To attain correct handling balance, they actually used <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> geometry at the front, with the steering pivots mounted at the outer ends of single swing wishbones. These caused too much understeer and uneven tyre wear, and modifications were made to reduce the positive camber of the front wheels by lowering the <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> pivot points. Aftermarket kits were also available to do this, and an inexpensive alternative was to insert a tapered shim to change the inclination of the kingpin carrier relative to the wishbone.|$|R
5000|$|The first-generation Corvair {{featured}} a rear engine + <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> design {{similar to that}} of the Renault Dauphine and Volkswagen Beetle [...] - [...] a design which eliminates universal joints at the wheels and keeps the rear wheels perpendicular to the half-shafts. The design can allow rear tires to undergo large camber angle changes during fast cornering due to side g-forces causing [...] "rebound" [...] camber and decreasing the tread contact with the road surface, leading to a loss of rear wheel grip and oversteer—a dynamically unstable condition where a driver can lose control and spin. The problem is most severe with rear-engine <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> combinations because of the greater inertial mass over the rear wheels and the higher center of gravity during rebound camber conditions. The additional high weight of a station wagon body also exacerbates the tendency. Oversteer is exacerbated by deceleration during cornering due to increased side g-force and lightened load on rear tires (lift-off oversteer). Understeer is common in front-engine cars, due to more weight, and inertia, on the front tires. Both conditions are dangerous when a car is driven at its cornering limits.Design options to ameliorate <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> handling: ...|$|R
5000|$|This second-generation Type 2 {{lost its}} {{distinctive}} split front windshield, and was slightly larger and considerably heavier than its predecessor. Its common nicknames are Breadloaf and Bay-window, or Loaf and Bay for short. At 1.6 L and [...] DIN, {{the engine was}} also slightly larger. The battery and electrical system was upgraded to 12 volts, making it incompatible with electric accessories from the previous generation. The new model also did away with the <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> rear suspension and transfer boxes previously used to raise ride height. Instead, half-shaft axles fitted with constant velocity joints raised ride height without the wild changes in camber of the Beetle-based <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> suspension. The updated Bus transaxle is usually sought after by off-road racers using air-cooled Volkswagen components.|$|R
2500|$|... front it {{consisted}} of double wishbones, with a thick sheet steel (4mm) upper wishbone, lever-arm Houdaille hydraulic dampers, longitudinal torsion bars, and lower location through a transverse leaf spring; {{at the rear of}} <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> and radius arms, with a transverse leaf spring and longitudinal torsion bars.|$|R
50|$|More {{unconventional}} {{was the use}} of a backbone chassis and four-wheel independent suspension.A-arm suspension (short upper arm, long lower arm) with coils {{was used}} at the front and <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> suspension with semi-trailing arms, Panhard rods and a transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring was used at the rear.|$|R
5000|$|Volkswagen Beetle - (original Beetle) senstitivity to crosswinds, {{due to the}} {{lightness}} of {{the front of the}} rear engine car; and poor roll stability due to the <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> suspension. People who drove them hard fitted reversed wheels and bigger rear tires and rims to ameliorate.|$|R
50|$|The wheels were {{independently}} sprung, {{the rear}} wheels being attached to a <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> and supported by springs with hydraulic shock absorbers. All four wheels were connected to the foot brake via a hydraulic system, while the hand brake was a mechanical one operating on {{the rear wheels}}.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{use of the}} <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> {{concept is}} Ford's [...] "Twin I-Beam" [...] front {{suspension}} for trucks. This system has solid axles, and may transmit power in four-wheel-drive versions, where it is called [...] "Twin Traction Beam". Though it is an independent suspension system, as each tire rises and falls without affecting {{the position of the}} other, the parallelogram action of the A-arm suspension system is not present. Each tire moves in an arc, but, due to the longer arms, camber changes are proportionally smaller than in powered <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> for the rear wheels listed above. The pivot point of the axles is lower and located not {{in the center of the}} car, but nearly on the opposite beam of the chassis, so the effect is far less hazardous.|$|R
50|$|For the 1968 model year, 1969 in the USA, a three-speed fully {{automatic}} transaxle became available, noted for extremely low internal friction. With the automatic came completely {{independent rear suspension}} (IRS), replacing the <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> set-up. For 1969, the IRS rear axle was standard with both automatic and manual transmissions.|$|R
50|$|Further {{improvements}} to the suspension followed with the 1500 included longer <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> and a lowered spring mounting pointfor more negative camber and a wider rear track. The wider, lower stance gave an impressive skid pad result of 0.87g average.This put the Spitfire head and shoulders over its competition in handling.|$|R
50|$|Like the Astra it {{featured}} a rear-mounted 322 cc air-cooled engine mounted under {{the floor at}} the rear and all-round independent suspension with <b>swing</b> <b>axles</b> at the rear. Drive was by chain to the rear wheels through a three-speed motorcycle gearbox with floor-mounted change lever. The brakes were hydraulically operated.|$|R
5000|$|A de Dion tube is an {{automobile}} suspension technology. It is a sophisticated form of non-independent suspension {{and is a}} considerable improvement over the <b>swing</b> <b>axle,</b> Hotchkiss drive, or live axle. Because it plays no part in transmitting power to the drive wheels, it is sometimes called a [...] "dead axle".|$|R
5000|$|Tatra 80 is an {{automobile}} from Tatra designed by Hans Ledwinka in 1931. It was Tatra's flagship product at the time, powered by water-cooled 5991 cc V12 engine, including the familiar backbone chassis and <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> suspension. With engine power of [...] {{the car has}} top speed of 140 km/h.|$|R
25|$|One year later, {{a revised}} model, called the 6C 2300 B was presented. In this version {{the engine was}} placed in a {{completely}} newly designed chassis, with individual front suspension and rear <b>swing</b> <b>axle,</b> and hydraulic brakes. The 6C-2300 was produced in 760 copies with rigid axles and 870 copies of the B-model.|$|R
50|$|In 1960, Chevrolet {{introduced}} the Corvair, a compact {{car with a}} rear-mounted air-cooled flat-six. A combination of design features, including the rear weight bias {{and the use of}} <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> rear suspension, increased the probability of lift-off oversteer. Incidents of lift-off oversteer ruined the Corvair's reputation, and the car was discontinued in 1969.|$|R
50|$|The {{steering}} {{employed a}} {{rack and pinion}} mechanism which was conventional at the time. It required 2¼ turns between opposite locks: the turning circle was 11 m. The front wheels were suspended by two laterally mounted leaf springs. At the back there was a <b>swing</b> <b>axle</b> with semi-elliptical longitudinally configured leaf springs.|$|R
