Once destruction of the brain is complete, the cerebellum, midbrain, thalami, basal ganglia, choroid plexus, and portions of the occipital lobes typically remain preserved to varying degrees. Though the cerebral cortex is absent, {{in most cases the}} fetal head remains enlarged due to the continued production by the choroid plexus of cerebrospinal fluid that is inadequately reabsorbed causing increased intracranial pressure.|$|E

50|$|Diagnosis may {{be delayed}} {{for several months}} because the infant's early {{behavior}} appears to be relatively normal. Transillumination, an examination in which light is passed through body tissues, {{can be used to}} diagnose hydranencephaly. An accurate, confirmed diagnosis is generally impossible until after birth, though prenatal diagnosis using fetal ultrasonography (ultrasound) can identify characteristic physical abnormalities that exist. Through thorough clinical evaluation, via physical findings, detailed patient history, and advanced imaging techniques, such as angiogram, computerized tomography (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or more rarely transillumination after birth are the most accurate diagnostic techniques. However, diagnostic literature fails to provide a clear distinction between <b>severe</b> obstructive <b>hydrocephalus</b> and hydranencephaly, leaving some children with an unsettled diagnosis.|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} features and endoscopic findings were investigated in 20 patients with isolated lateral ventricle treated by neuroendoscopic septostomy to establish cerebrospinal fluid communication and open an isolated ventricular compartment. The endoscopic procedure was incomplete because of thickened septum pellucidum and insufficient working space in two adults with postmeningitic hydrocephalus. Two children underwent second septostomy. In all other cases, results were good {{and there were}} no complications related to endoscopic procedures. Endoscopic septostomy is less invasive and has few complications.

40|$|Seventy-five {{children}} {{treated for}} craniopharyngioma between 1973 and 1994 were studied to demonstrate which pre- and intraoperative factors were {{indicative of a}} poor outcome as defined by a quantitative assessment of morbidity. This involved a retrospective review of 65 patients and a prospective study of 10 patients focused on clinical details and cranial imaging and a follow-up "study assessment" of 66 survivors performed over the last 2 years. As part of the assessment, 63 patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging with a three-dimensional volume acquisition sequence 1. 5 to 19. 2 years after initial surgery. Predictors of high morbidity included <b>severe</b> <b>hydrocephalus,</b> intraoperative adverse events, and young age (or = 3. 5 cm) of the tumor in the midline, and attempts to remove adherent tumor from {{the region of the}} hypothalamus at operation.

40|$|We {{searched for}} {{factors that could}} {{predispose}} towards persistent hydrocephalus in children with posterior fossa (PF) tumors {{in order to determine}} the need for permanent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion. The clinical records of 64 children who underwent surgery for PF tumors in the Pediatric Neurosurgery division of the Hospital of Clinics, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil, from 1990 to 2006, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients` ages ranged from 3 months to 18 years. The factors evaluated included age at surgery, severity of hydrocephalus (ventricular index), tumor location, size of the tumor, extent of tumor resection, and histology. Ventricular index, measured from the initial neuroradiological image, age at surgery, and location of the tumor were significantly associated with definitive postoperative CSF diversion (shunt or endoscopic third ventriculostomy), which was necessary for 34 % of the patients.

40|$|Rhesus monkey fetuses were inoculated intracerebrally with {{wild-type}} {{mumps virus}} {{near the beginning}} of the last third of the gestation period. Within three days after inoculation, mumps virus was isolated from many fetal tissues. Thirteen animals re-ceiving virus were delivered at term. Five of these showed slight to <b>severe</b> hydro-cephalus. <b>Hydrocephalus</b> was most prominent in the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles, but other lesions occurred at various levels of the ventricular system.

The recov-ery of mumps virus from newborn rhesus monkeys two months after inoculation suggests that attempts should be made to document similar persistence of the virus in humans. Furthermore, this model indicates that mumps virus infection in humans maysesult in hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus remains a major problem in pedi-atric neurology.

40|$|The L 1 cell {{adhesion}} molecule (L 1 CAM) {{plays an important role}} in axon growth, fasciculation, and neural migration. Mutations in the L 1 CAM gene produce a phenotype characterised by X linked hydrocephalus, mental retardation, spastic paraplegia, adducted thumbs, and agenesis of the corpus callosum. We have conducted a detailed analysis of the phenotypic effects of missense mutations in the extracellular portion of L 1 CAM, following a study that differentiated between "key" amino acid residues critical for maintaining the conformation of the extracellular immunoglobulin type C-like (Ig) or fibronectin type III-like (FN) domains and surface residues of less certain significance. We have analysed the data from 71 published cases and seven patients whose mutations were detected in our laboratory to determine if the site of a missense mutation in the Ig or FN domains correlated with the severity of hydrocephalus, presence of adducted thumbs, or survival past infancy. Mutations affecting the key residues in either type of domain were more likely to produce a phenotype with <b>severe</b> <b>hydrocephalus,</b> adducted thumbs, and lifespan less than one year than were mutations affecting surface residues. In addition, mutations affecting the FN domains were more likely than those affecting Ig domains to produce a phenotype with <b>severe</b> <b>hydrocephalus,</b> with less certain effects on adducted thumbs and lifespan. Mutations in key residues of the FN domains were particularly deleterious to infant survival. These data provide information that may be useful in predicting some aspects of the phenotypic effects of certain L 1 CAM mutations...|$|E

40|$|The phylogenetically conserved nuclear factor I (NFI) {{family of}} transcription/replication {{proteins}} is essential both for adenoviral DNA replication {{and for the}} transcription of many cellular genes. We showed previously that the four murine NFI genes (Nfia, Nfib, Nfic, and Nfix) are expressed in unique but overlapping patterns during mouse development and in adult tissues. Here we show that disruption of the Nfia gene causes perinatal lethality, with > 95 % of homozygous Nfia−/− animals dying within 2 weeks after birth. Newborn Nfia−/− animals lack a corpus callosum and show ventricular dilation indicating early hydrocephalus. Rare surviving homozygous Nfia−/− mice lack a corpus callosum, show <b>severe</b> communicating <b>hydrocephalus,</b> a full-axial tremor indicative of neurological defects, male-sterility, low female fertility, but near normal life spans. These findings indicate that while the Nfia gene appears nonessential for cell viability and DNA replication in embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts, loss of Nfia function causes severe developmental defects.

30|$|The cavum septi pellucidi (CSP) is an {{important}} landmark {{in the evaluation of}} the fetal neural axis, identified as a fluid-filled space between the leaves of the septum pellucidum. Visualisation of the CSP has become an essential component of a second and third trimester prenatal ultrasound [1, 2]. Correctly identifying its presence or absence is very important in predicting the course of fetal central forebrain development. CSP non-visualisation is rarely isolated; it is typically associated with malformations of prosencephalic development, which include agenesis/dysgenesis of corpus callosum (CC), schizencephaly, septo-optic dysplasia (SOD) and spectrum of holoprosencephaly (HPE), or non-visualisation of the CSP is secondary to a disruptive process caused by prolonged ischaemia, resulting in necrotic disruption of the septum pellucidum, {{as can be seen in}} <b>severe</b> chronic <b>hydrocephalus,</b> and acquired fetal brain injury. Barkovich et al. [3] have stressed the importance of absence of the septum pellucidum as a valuable clue in the diagnosis of these central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. A step-wise algorithm based on post-natal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was described to facilitate the diagnostic process, which would be challenging to apply in prenatal ultrasound given technical and patient related limitations. Nevertheless, this finding should prompt detailed sonographic imaging with the assistance of fetal MRI to overcome the limitations posed by ultrasound.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} neurological diseases, including HIV- 1 encephalitis, Alzheimer's disease, and brain trauma, are associated with increased cerebral expression of the multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). To determine whether overexpression of TGF-beta 1 within {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) can {{contribute to the development of}} neuropathological alterations, a bioactive form of TGF-beta 1 was expressed in astrocytes of transgenic mice. Transgenic mice with high levels of cerebral TGF-beta 1 expression developed a <b>severe</b> communicating <b>hydrocephalus,</b> seizures, motor incoordination, and early runting. While unmanipulated heterozygous transgenic mice from a low expressor line showed no such alterations, increasing TGF-beta 1 expression in this line by injury-induced astroglial activation or generation of homozygous offspring did result in the abnormal phenotype. Notably, astroglial overexpression of TGF-beta 1 consistently induced a strong upmodulation of the extracellular matrix proteins laminin and fibronectin in the CNS, particularly in the vicinity of TGF-beta 1 -expressing perivascular astrocytes, but was not associated with obvious CNS infiltration by hematogenous cells. While low levels of extracellular matrix protein expression may assist in CNS wound repair and regeneration, excessive extracellular matrix deposition could result in the development of hydrocephalus. As an effective inducer of extracellular matrix components, TGF-beta 1 may also contribute to the development of other neuropathological alterations, eg, the formation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease...|$|R
40|$|Congenital and {{perinatal}} primary brain neoplasms {{are extremely}} rare. Brainstem neoplasms in the perinatal and neonatal period are typically of high-grade nature and have poor prognoses with survival rates {{of less than}} 2 years from diagnosis. Herein, we report an unusual case of congenital anaplastic oligodendroglioma that arose in the pons and was detected as diffuse pontine glioma on in utero imaging studies during prenatal evaluation at 26 weeks’ gestation. A male infant was delivered at 36. 4 weeks of gestation via Cesarean section who developed progressive dyspnea shortly after birth.

On postmortem examination cut sections through the brainstem and cerebellum disclosed the neoplasm that infiltrated the entire pons, extended into the midbrain, medulla, cerebellar peduncles, and caudal diencephalon. Histological sections demonstrated an anaplastic oligodendroglioma infiltrating the pons, 4 th ventricle, midbrain, medulla, cerebellar white matter, posterior thalamus, and occipital white matter. The pathological features of the lesion distinguish it from previous reports in which spontaneous regression of pontine gliomas occurred and argue in favor of establishing a tissue diagnosis to plan for aggressive versus conservative management...|$|R
