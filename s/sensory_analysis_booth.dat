40|$|Organoleptic {{properties}} of old apple cultivars evaluated by <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis.</b> In {{the framework of}} a research programme focused on the evaluation and the valorization of fruit tree genetic resources, the <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> technique has been used in order to evaluate the organoleptic {{properties of}} six old apple cultivars which are on trial in Belgium and North of France. The aims were to define their optimal picking time and storage aptitude, therefore marketing advices could be given to growers. Methodological aspects have been investigated on different <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> parameters adapted to fresh fruits e. g. panel selection and formation, choice of descriptors. <b>Sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> was applied just after picking and periodically during the storage period. For each fruit sample, different characteristics were measured (brix, pH and flesh firmness) with the objective to calculate the correlation between <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> data and analytical data. The results show that for the Jonagold cv., there is a very high correlation between ""crunchiness"", ""flesh firmness"" and ""juiciness"" sensory evaluated data. Other results, based on the experimentation of the six old cvs, confirm the correlation between the <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> of the ""flesh firmness"" and the ""juiciness"", they show that the ""flesh firmness"" can be well assessed by a <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> panel, and that the global fruit quality appreciation depends mostly on ""juiciness"", ""flesh firmness"" and sweet sensation. The <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> can give good indication for a better commercial management of apple cvs concerning picking date, storage capacity and the best storage conditions to be chosen...|$|R

The coffee samples used were from the Coffea arabica L., cultivars Acaiá do Cerrado, Topázio, Acaiá 474 - 19 and Bourbon, collected in the southern region {{of the state of}} Minas Gerais. The chemical analyses were carried out for reducing and non-reducing sugars.

Furthermore, <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> may be combined with other types of information such as personality and environment factors to increase understanding of acceptable pet foods.

40|$|Quality {{evaluation}} of traditional balsamic vinegar (TBV) is primarily based on <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis.</b> For every TBV batch, official sensory panels give a final score, which determines its assessment into quality and price categories. Therefore, {{an effective and}} objective <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> is a core aspect in TBV production and marketing and it should fulfill at least two conditions: i) the panelists have been properly trained on the TBV features; ii) the panelists have {{to be free from}} any psychological and physical conditions which might affect human judgments. Traditionally, a panel of trained members assesses the TBV sensory attributes evaluating visual, olfactory, gustatory and trigeminal features at the same time. The result is that visual appearance significantly affects the subsequent stages of the <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis,</b> and even the olfactory and gustatory sensations will greatly affect each other. The aim of this work was to review the procedures for the <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> of TBV and to define a set of TBV attributes.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{development}} of {{agriculture in the}} northeastern semi-arid region depends, at least in part, on the correct exploitation and efficient use of natural resources. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of the use of saline water on morphophysiological responses and <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> of ‘Boa noite’ plants (Catharanthus roseus) in soil fertilized with bovine biofertilizer. A completely randomized design was used in the split plot arrangement, the plots being formed by the five irrigation water salinity levels (0. 5, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10 dS m- 1), and the subplots by two frequencies of application of the 150 mL pot- 1 of liquid bovine biofertilizer (divided into one and five times), with five replicates. The analysed variables were: leaf gas exchange relative chlorophyll index, biometry, dry matter (leaf, stems, flowers and roots) and <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> (general appearance and buyers’ preference). Quantitative (growth and physiological) and qualitative (<b>sensory</b> <b>analysis)</b> responses show that Catharanthus roseus plants can be produced using saline water at the level of 2. 5 dS m- 1, and the plants of this treatment were preferred by the judges in <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis.</b> Biofertilizer application frequency did not attenuate the effects of salinity. Therefore, the liquid bovine biofertilizer can be applied all at once, reducing costs...|$|R
40|$|Food {{suppliers}} currently measure apple quality considering basic pomological descriptors. <b>Sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> is expensive, {{does not}} permit to analyse many samples, and cannot be implemented for measuring quality properties in real time. However, <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is the best way}} to precisely describe food eating quality, since it is able to define, measure, and explain what is really perceivable by human senses and using a language that closely reflects the consumers’ perception. On the basis of such observations, we developed a detailed protocol for apple sensory profiling by descriptive <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> and instrumental measurements. The collected sensory data were validated by applying rigorous scientific criteria for <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis.</b> The method was then applied for studying sensory properties of apples and their changes in relation to different pre- and post-harvest factors affecting fruit quality, and demonstrated to be able to discriminate fruit varieties and to highlight differences in terms of sensory properties. The instrumental measurements confirmed such results. Moreover, the correlation between sensory and instrumental data was studied, and a new effective approach was defined for the reliable prediction of sensory properties by instrumental characterisation. It is therefore possible to propose the application of this sensory-instrumental tool to all the stakeholders involved in apple production and marketing, to have a reliable description of apple fruit quality...|$|R

Consumer <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> showed that mango was preferred compared to the pawpaw, but that only one-third of those who preferred the mango were correctly able to identify it.
