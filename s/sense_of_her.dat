500|$|In {{her third}} chapter, Greenwood {{examines}} her experiences among London's ceremonial magicians, focusing on her {{training in the}} Hermetic Qabalah, a [...] "magical language" [...] for exploring the otherworld. Adopting Luhrmann's concept of [...] "interpretative drift", she relates how she shifted her understanding of events to make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> magical experiences. However, in contrast to Luhrmann's emphasis on how practitioners overcame their initial scepticism, Greenwood focuses on how these practitioners learn [...] "the language of another mode of reality" [...] through their experiences. Chapter four details Greenwood's early involvement in Wicca, through three separate covens. Offering her thoughts on Wiccan invocations, she then discusses the faith's approach to sexual polarity, pointing to the sexual underpinnings of the Great Rite and the Gnostic Mass as evidence. The chapter is rounded off with an explanation of how Wicca understands the natural world and a comparison between the religion and ceremonial magic.|$|E
500|$|As {{children}} {{coming of}} age, Scout and Jem face hard realities {{and learn from}} them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie {{the day after the}} trial, [...] "It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like". This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the course}} of Caged Bird, Maya, who has been {{described}} as [...] "a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America", goes from being a victim of racism with an inferiority complex to a self-aware individual who responds to racism with dignity and a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own identity. Feminist scholar Maria Lauret states that the [...] "formation of female cultural identity" [...] is woven into the book's narrative, setting Maya up as [...] "a role model for Black women". [...] Scholar Liliane Arensberg calls this presentation Angelou's [...] "identity theme" [...] and a major motif in Angelou's narrative. [...] Maya's unsettled life in Caged Bird suggests her sense of self [...] "as perpetually in the process of becoming, of dying and being reborn, in all its ramifications". African-American literature scholar Dolly McPherson agrees, stating that Angelou creatively uses Christian mythology and theology to present the Biblical themes of death, regeneration, and rebirth.|$|E
60|$|He woke late, with {{a longing}} {{to put his}} two <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> to the proof of day; and as early in the forenoon as he could hope to see her, he walked out towards her aunt's house. It was a mild, dull morning, with a misted sunshine; in the little crimson tassels of the budded maples {{overhead}} the bees were droning.|$|R
5000|$|La Vanguardia {{wrote that}} León [...] "has {{the power to}} captivate the five <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> audience" [...] and [...] "on stage, she is an {{imposing}} presence, winning over audience with her astonishing vitality and the energy <b>of</b> <b>her</b> interpretations." [...] La Provincia, commenting about León’s performance in 2009 wrote, [...] "Fully substantive interpretation… the variety of the program reflects a curiosity, maturity and experience generally absent in young virtuosos … a combination of perfection and grace…wonderful acoustic flavor…a performer who will arouse much fascination." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{suggestion}} {{that there had}} been anything of mirth from which Mr. Sarsby desired to lead the way appealed to the girl's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor. <b>Her</b> lips parted, and the sullen discontent <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face was for a moment lightened.|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Blow" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Marrs Piliero. The video was released on February 25, 2011. Kesha wanted the video to be [...] "different, a video that was cool and random". The director, Piliero, {{came up with the}} idea for the video's mythological aspect saying, [...] "I had this idea running in my head with just the idea of unicorns, If I massacred unicorns, they could bleed rainbows. I'm a fan of violence and I'm always trying to find a way to make it OK." [...] While being interviewed Piliero spoke of the collaboration with Kesha, explaining her point of view on the video, [...] "Before we started filming, we had quite a few talks. She was adamant you can't back away from the crazy; everything about the idea she loved and she enforced the fact that she wanted to embrace every aspect of it and really go for it, On set, she was having fun. She was like, 'I want to lick a unicorn.' It was rad working with her because there definitely wasn't a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> feeling awkward about stuff or detached; no ego. It felt like we had worked together before." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} [...] "In {{addition}} to raising the Madonna/whore ante with songs like the title cut, Virgin cradled {{the kind of}} '80s hits ("Dress You Up") built to transcend the Dynasty era." [...] Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine remembered {{the first time that}} he heard the songs from the album and commented, [...] "Lots of critics think something similar occurred when Madonna followed her eponymous debut with Like a Virgin, helmed by Nile Rodgers with all the fixin's—too calculated next to the 'raw passion' of the debut. This is nonsense; it misses how Madonna conflated notions of spontaneity and calculation. Rodgers is the ideal collaborator." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times said: [...] "With a tough-cookie voice that's both coy and streetwise, Madonna's singing harks back to the rock-and-roll girl-group tradition that preceded the Beatles. But where girl groups, from the Shirelles to the Ronettes, worshipfully extolled their boyfriends' cars, haircuts and rebel poses, Madonna's point of view is decidedly more self-interested. In matters of love, she is a comparison shopper with a shrewd <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own market value. The words 'shiny and new' describe not only the way the love-smitten singer feels in the title song but the sound of the album." ...|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, in 2013 Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{pointed out}} that [...] "two decades after its release, the Icelandic artist's first album has never sounded more relevant." [...] He argued that Debut [...] "reconstructed pop music", also writing that [...] "while pop in 2013 looks {{back to the early}} 90s for inspiration, Björk's ability on Debut to {{innovate}} by using disparate genres without losing a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own identity should be the blueprint for any new artist with desires to break the mould." [...] In the album's entry in their list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time" [...] —where the album was included at number 46—, NME claimed that [...] "Debut achieved the remarkable feat of turning an idiosyncratic vocalist from a feted cult band into a significant global pop star, without losing one iota of the experimental mindset and creative cool that made her so special." [...] In 2005, Björk stated that she thought the album wasn't as strong as her later efforts: [...] "It's hard to judge yourself but I don't think [...] my best. Debut was the album that went the highest up there in terms of what is 'Bjork music'. But I think that the persona I created, which was entirely accidental, is better captured on the later albums".|$|E

30|$|There are {{no other}} verses in the Therigatha where a nun’s bed is mentioned. Patacara’s poem is {{intimate}} in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> bringing <b>her</b> audience into her personal space, both emotionally and physically.|$|R
500|$|As Lupton points out, all of Angelou's autobiographies, {{especially}} Caged Bird and {{its immediate}} sequel Gather Together in My Name, are [...] "very much {{concerned with what}} [...] knew and how she learned it". Lupton compares Angelou's informal education with the education of other Black writers of the twentieth century, who did not earn official degrees and depended upon the [...] "direct instruction of African American cultural forms". Angelou's quest for learning and literacy parallels [...] "the central myth of black culture in America": that freedom and literacy are connected. Angelou is influenced by writers introduced to her by Mrs. Flowers during her self-imposed muteness, including Edgar Allan Poe and William Shakespeare. Angelou states, early in Caged Bird, that she, as the Maya character, [...] "met {{and fell in love}} with William Shakespeare". Critic Mary Vermillion sees a connection between Maya's rape and Shakespeare's [...] "The Rape of Lucrece", which Maya memorizes and recites when she regains her speech. [...] Vermillion maintains that Maya finds comfort in the poem's identification with suffering. Maya finds novels and their characters complete and meaningful, so she uses them to make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bewildering world. She is so involved in her fantasy world of books that she even uses them as a way to cope with her rape, writing in Caged Bird, [...] "...I was sure that any minute my mother or Bailey or the Green Hornet would bust in the door and save me".|$|E
500|$|Lynch as Sue {{received}} {{high praise}} for her acting. Canning wrote that she [...] "stole the episode" [...] and [...] "perfectly portrayed a woman [...] hard heart was trying terribly not to break, but {{not being able}} to stop it." [...] BuddyTV John Kubicek stated, [...] "it's impossible for me to say that Lynch wasn't exceptional, because her slow breakdown and attempt to cover-up her emotions was well done and fit perfectly with the character." [...] Respers France commented that [...] "we got to see the range and complexity of Sue Sylvester", and Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly said that Lynch did an [...] "outstanding job of delivering even the funniest quips with an underlying sense of sadness". Sue's characterization in the series was criticized by several reviewers, however. Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times stated that the [...] "consistent inconsistency of Sue's character is wearing thin", and that [...] "our <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fails to advance, wandering endlessly between pure evil and pure love for her sister." [...] Futterman called the episode a [...] "too-little-too late attempt at redemption for Sue's poor characterization this season." [...] VanDerWerff wrote that the episode [...] "feels very self-consciously like a way to just remove her character from the table for the season finale", that [...] "it feels very self-consciously like an attempt by the show to address the fact that the character doesn't make any sense", and criticized the death of Jean: [...] "killing her solely to right a wayward character arc is lazy writing, and no amount of actor commitment can wholly save it." [...] Fallon described the funeral plot line as [...] "pure, classic Glee: Egregiously random, emotionally manipulative, wholly unnecessary to plot development, and, in the end, deeply moving." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2015, {{she played}} Graciela Arias {{in the film}} Los Crímenes del Mar del Norte, based on {{the true story of}} Goyo Cárdenas, the {{strangler}} of Tacuba. The following year, Espinosa played Mexican singer Lola Beltrán on Hasta Que Te Conocí, based on the life of Mexican artist Juan Gabriel, for which she had to perform the track [...] "Cucurrucucú Paloma", Beltrán's signature song. Espinosa co-produced, co-wrote, and starred in Los Bañistas, a film that had a limited release in Mexico (10 copies) in 2016. In the film, directed by Max Zunino, she plays Flavia, a young protester who gets involved with an older man, Juan Carlos Colombo. Espinosa's performance was met with positive reviews, such as the one written by Luis Fernando Galván of En Filme, stating that the actress [...] "effectively embodies the hope for social renewal from a convincing performance where she goes on a trip into a social space with the intention of finding her place in the world and helping others to do the same". Espinosa and Zunino re-teamed for Bruma, in which the actress plays Martina, and according to John Hopewell of Variety, [...] "follows a young woman (Espinosa) from Mexico's stifling upper middle-classes who, pregnant, escapes to Berlin and finds a kind of father figure and freedom in a Berlin club drag queen chanteuse and a final <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> individual identity". The film was written by Espinosa and Zunino and won five awards at the 10th Works in Progress Guadalajara Festival. In 2016, it was announced by Variety magazine that Espinosa would join Mexican actors Demián Bichir and Diego Luna in the film The Black Minutes; in the same year, Espinosa played Rocío in the TV series Las Trece Esposas, produced by Blim and inspired by One Thousand and One Nights. Espinosa also had a voice role in the American animated film Kubo and the Two Strings (2016) and a role in La Gran Promesa, directed by Jorge Ramirez Suárez.|$|E

2500|$|Journalists {{debated the}} issue of {{allowing}} Clinton to retain her privacy. Most media outlets concluded {{that she should be}} off-limits due to her age, although Rush Limbaugh and Saturday Night Live both broadcast material mocking her appearance. During this phase of her life, her father said, [...] "We really work hard on making sure that Chelsea doesn't let other people define her <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own self-worth... It's tough when you are an adolescent... but I think she'll be ok." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mademoiselle {{was moved}} from the Louvre to the Palais des Tuileries and placed {{under the care of}} Jeanne de Harley, Madame de Saint Georges, the head of her household, who taught her how to read and write. Mademoiselle always had a great <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own self-importance and when asked about her {{maternal}} grandmother Henriette Catherine de Joyeuse she replied that she was not her grandmother, because she was [...] "not a queen". She grew up in the company of Mademoiselle de Longueville, as well as the sisters of the Maréchal de Gramont.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout her career, however, Itō {{has embraced}} {{the metaphor of}} the poet as a shamaness. [...] In 1991, she collaborated with the {{prominent}} feminist scholar Chizuko Ueno from Tokyo University on a collection of essays and poetry called , which the two likened to the collaboration between an Okinawan shamaness and the figure who makes <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> utterances for the outside world. [...] A few years later in 1993, Itō explicitly played out the metaphor of poet as shamaness in her long narrative poem , in which she takes a story recorded from a shamaness in Tsugaru in the early 20th century and refashions it into a dramatic new myth of healing from sexual abuse and self-discovery.|$|E

2500|$|In 1992, Williams {{published}} {{her first}} book, an autobiographical account titled [...] (Doubleday, London). It was an international best seller including spending fifteenweeks on The New York Times Best Seller list for adult non-fiction in 1993. It was short-listed for the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards for non-fiction in 1992. According to Kirkus Reviews the book enabled people associated with autistic individuals, to [...] "understand more clearly what those unresponsive 'dead eyes' see". While Daniel Goleman of The New York Times described how Williams [...] "originally wrote it {{as a series}} of notes to herself, to help her make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own chaotic world. She planned to burn her journal until a therapist helped her see the value in sharing it".|$|E
2500|$|The end of Thérèse's {{time as a}} {{postulant}} {{arrived on}} the January 10, 1889, with her taking of the habit. [...] From that time she wore the 'rough homespun and brown scapular, white wimple and veil, leather belt with rosary, woollen 'stockings', rope sandals". Her father's health having temporarily stabilized {{he was able to}} attend, though twelve days after her ceremony her father suffered a stroke and was taken to a private sanatorium, the Bon Sauveur at Caen, where he remained for three years before returning to Lisieux in 1892. In this period Thérèse deepened the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> vocation; to lead a hidden life, to pray and offer her suffering for priests, to forget herself, to increase discreet acts of charity. She wrote, [...] "I applied myself especially to practice little virtues, not having the facility to perform great ones ... In her letters from this period of her novitiate, Thérèse returned over and over to the theme of littleness, referring to herself as a grain of sand, an image she borrowed from Pauline...'Always littler, lighter, in order to be lifted more easily by the breeze of love.' The remainder of her life would be defined by retreat and subtraction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Songs in A Minor {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, it received an average score of 78, based on 10 reviews. Sam Faulkner of NME described {{the balance between}} contemporary music and retrospective as [...] "an act of pure genius". Q magazine hailed it as [...] "a prime candidate to head up the nu-soul revolution ... with a voice that challenges Mary J. Blige's". Steve Jones of USA Today said that [...] "Keys already has a musical, artistic and thematic maturity that many more experienced artists never achieve". The Washington Posts Richard Harrington wrote favorably of Keys' musical influences on the album and expressed that she has [...] "vocal maturity and writing instincts beyond her years". PopMatters critic Mark Anthony Neal praised Keys' performance on the album and called it [...] "a distinct and oft-times brilliant debut from an artist who clearly has a fine <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> creative talents". Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, said that the [...] "grace and grit" [...] {{of the first half}} warrant the [...] "auspicious debut" [...] label and that, after some [...] "bores that threaten to sink the project midway through," [...] Keys sustains the album with the songs at the end.|$|E
