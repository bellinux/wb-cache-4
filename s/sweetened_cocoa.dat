Some people from Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas also prefer to prepare sourdough. Sour Pozol {{is more common in}} Tuxtla Gutierrez. Sour dough is fermented for three days and can be taken with or without sugar. It can be consumed cold with a pinch of salt and a slice of chili (or swallowing salt mixed with chili powder). Currently, the Lacandones use pozol mixed with honey to lower fever and control diarrhea and other intestinal disorders, in a similar way as other people use drugs or eat foods containing yeast or lactobacillus.Today, pozol is also prepared using milk and horchata. The corn dough is mixed with milk, instead of water, and sugar. This combination makes a much sweeter version of the traditional pozol. <b>Sweetened</b> pozol with <b>cocoa</b> is the most popular version of pozol in tabasco.|$|R
