Against the wishes of Sukarno, the government ended Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations (Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year). Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> amongst elements of the armed forces.|$|E
500|$|Following Tyler's {{break with}} the Whigs in 1841, he {{attempted}} a return to his old Democratic party, but its members, especially the followers of Van Buren, were not ready to accept him. He knew that, with little chance of election, {{the only way to}} salvage his presidential legacy was to move public opinion in favor of the Texas issue. He formed a third party, the Democratic-Republicans, using the officeholders and political networks he had built over the previous year. Multiple supportive newspapers across the country issued editorials promoting his candidacy throughout the early months of 1844. Reports of meetings held throughout the country suggest that <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> was not limited to officeholders, as is widely assumed. Just as the Democratic Party was holding its presidential nomination in Baltimore, Maryland, the Tyler supporters, in that very city, were holding signs reading [...] "Tyler and Texas!", and with their own high visibility and energy they gave Tyler their nomination. His new Democratic-Republican Party renominated Tyler for the presidency on May 27, 1844.|$|E
500|$|Árbenz {{decided to}} arm the {{civilian}} population to defend the capital; however, this plan failed, as an insufficient number of volunteers turned up. At this point, Colonel Carlos Enrique Díaz de León, {{the chief of staff}} of the Guatemalan army, reneged on his <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and began plotting to overthrow Árbenz with the assistance of other senior army officers. They informed Peurifoy of this plan, asking him to stop the hostilities in return for Árbenz's resignation. On 27June 1954 Árbenz met with Díaz, and informed him that he was resigning. Árbenz left office at 8pm, after recording a resignation speech that was broadcast on the radio an hour later. Immediately afterward, Díaz announced that he would be taking over the presidency in the name of the Guatemalan Revolution, and stated that the Guatemalan army would still fight against Castillo Armas's invasion. The military junta that took over consisted of Díaz, Colonel H.Elfego Monzón, and Colonel José Angel Sánchez. Peurifoy had not expected Díaz to form a military junta and keep fighting. A couple of days later, Peurifoy informed Díaz that he would have to resign; according to the CIA officer who spoke to Díaz, this was because he was [...] "not convenient for American foreign policy". At first, Díaz attempted to placate Peurifoy by forming a three-person junta, led by himself, but Peurifoy continued to insist that he resign. Díaz was overthrown by a rapid bloodless coup led by Monzón Aguirre, a more pliable army colonel. The other members of Monzón's junta were José Luis Cruz Salazar and Mauricio Dubois.|$|E

Roosevelt {{announced}} his so-called [...] court-packing plan in 1936. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sumners discreetly worked in opposition.

2500|$|A {{session of}} the MPRS was {{scheduled}} to open 12 May, but eventually began on 20 June and continued until 5 July. One of its first actions was to appoint General Abdul Haris Nasution as chairman. It then set about dismantling the apparatus Sukarno had built around himself. It passed several decrees, {{one of which was}} the ratification of the Supersemar, thus making revocation of it almost impossible. It also ratified the banning of the PKI and the teaching of Marxist ideology, instructed Suharto to form a new cabinet, called on Sukarno to provide an explanation for the economic and political situation in the nation and stripped him of the title [...] "president for life". It also passed a decree stating that if the president was unable to carry out his duties, the holder of the Supersemar would assume the presidency. Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> amongst elements of the armed forces (particularly the Marines, the navy, and some regional army divisions).|$|E

I used data from the 1994 midterms and the 104 th Congress and the 2002 midterms and the 108 th Congress.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a uni ed {{theoretical and empirical}} analysis of three longstanding explanations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> consistent loss of <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> party in midterm Congressional elections: (1) a electoral penalty by voters in midterm elections against <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> party, (2) a surge and decline in voter turnout, and (3) a reversion to the mean in voter ideology. To quantify the contribution {{of each of these}} factors, we build an econometric model in which voters jointly choose whether or not to participate and which party to support in both House and Presidential elections. Estimated using ANES data from both Presidential and midterm years, the model can fully explain the observed midterm gaps, and counterfactual simulations demonstrate that each factor makes a sizeable contribution towards the midterm gap...|$|R
