25|$|Soil nailing is a {{technique}} in which soil slopes, excavations or retaining walls are reinforced by the insertion of relatively slender elements – normally steel reinforcing bars. The bars are usually installed into a pre-drilled hole and then grouted into place or drilled and grouted simultaneously. They are usually installed untensioned at a slight downward inclination. A rigid or flexible facing (often <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete)</b> or isolated soil nail heads may be used at the surface.|$|E

The main characteristic of the building is {{the roof of the}} changing rooms and small gymnasium which has hyperbolic paraboloid roof light shells and is completely paved in quarry tiles. The roof of the sports hall consists of eight conoidal 2½-inch thick <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> shells springing from [...] long pre-stressed valley beams.

50|$|Structures, {{which are}} {{designed}} as integral arches, {{can be constructed}} as stiff individual objects or {{by means of a}} <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> procedure. Arches made of <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> provide for free and organic shapes, allowing rooms to become suffused with light. The <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> procedure was first used by natural scientist Carl Akeley in 1911. Akeley patented a device able to spray fine-grained concrete. While <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> is mainly applied in underground engineering and tunnel construction, Friedrich Kiesler was the first to use this technique for the construction of buildings. Swiss architect Peter Vetsch improved the technique over several years. To date, he has built over 40 earth houses using <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete,</b> and he can therefore be considered the leading authority in this area of expertise. The <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> is applied to a finely meshed metal stretch net which is welded onto the supporting armature. The curvatures are bent and formed according to the intended shape of the building. A 20 cm thick polyurethane solid-foam-insulation is sprayed onto the outside of the arches, protecting the house from low or high temperatures. A fleece filter mat is then laid on top of this and the building is covered with a thick layer of soil some 80 cm to 3 metres thick. The foundation of the buildings designed by Peter Vetsch are built conventionally. The interior walls of an earth house are furnished using loam rendering which provides superior humidity compensation. The loam rendering is finally coated with lime-white cement paint.|$|E

Then, the study considers systems made of coated <b>sprayed</b> hemp <b>concrete</b> for two kinds of coating.

Results show that <b>sprayed</b> hemp <b>concrete</b> has an excellent moisture buffer capacity (MBV= 2. 14 g/(m². %RH). So, it is an excellent hydric regulator that improves hygrothermal comfort and reduces energy needs. Once coated, hemp concrete remains good hygric regulator (for closed coating) and nearly excellent hygric regulator (with open coating). Also, the experimental data set can be used for benchmarking buffering models...|$|R

30|$|The mining method, {{based on}} {{drilling}} and blasting excavation, {{is the main}} construction method of highway tunneling in China. As construction technology and rock mechanics developed, the new Austrian tunneling method (NATM) was proposed and gradually accepted by tunnel engineers [3, 4]. The introduction of the NATM began with the promotion of “active” support technologies such as rock bolt and <b>spray</b> <b>concrete.</b> Based on the NATM principles, China has successfully built various types of highway tunnels in weak rock and other difficult conditions. Applications extended to shallow municipal road projects with complex geological conditions, and the traditional open-cut method {{was replaced by the}} Chinese-style shallow cover underground excavation method.|$|R

In 2005, the group secured funding to build a large-scale construction 3D printing machine using 'off the shelf' components (<b>concrete</b> pumping, <b>spray</b> <b>concrete,</b> gantry system) to explore how complex such components could be and realistically meet the demands for construction.|$|R

50|$|The New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM) was {{developed}} in the 1960s and is the best known of a number of engineering practices that use calculated and empirical measurements to provide safe support to the tunnel lining. The main idea of this method is to use the geological stress of the surrounding rock mass to stabilize the tunnel, by allowing a measured relaxation and stress reassignment into the surrounding rock to prevent full loads becoming imposed on the supports. Based on geotechnical measurements, an optimal cross section is computed. The excavation is protected by a layer of <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete,</b> commonly referred to as shotcrete. Other support measures can include steel arches, rockbolts and mesh. Technological developments in <b>sprayed</b> <b>concrete</b> technology have resulted in steel and polypropylene fibres being added to the concrete mix to improve lining strength. This creates a natural load-bearing ring, which minimizes the rock's deformation.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{deals with}} dynamic {{characterization}} of hydric behaviour of <b>sprayed</b> hemp <b>concrete.</b> The measurement of moisture buffer value (MBV) is held {{according to the}} NORDTEST protocol (Rode, 2005). Specimen are exposed to daily cyclic variation of relative humidity: 8 h at 75 %RH and 16 h at 33 %RH the test is held under isothermal conditions (23 °C). The experimental set-up is validated by comparison of moisture buffer value measured on cellular concrete with values given in the NORDTEST project for {{the same kind of}} material. Results show that <b>sprayed</b> hemp <b>concrete</b> has an excellent moisture buffer capacity (MBV = 2. 15 g/(m 2 %RH)). So, it is an excellent hydric regulator that improves hygrothermal comfort and reduces energy needs. Moisture effusivity is then calculated from sorption and water vapour permeability value and from dynamic test of MBV. The results (respectively 5. 8 * 10 ^- 07 and 4. 8 * 10 ^- 07 kg/ (m 2 Pa s 1 / 2) show a slight discrepancy between values obtained from steady-state and from dynamic conditions. Finally, the penetration depth for daily cyclic variation is estimated about 5. 8 cm for <b>sprayed</b> hemp <b>concrete.</b> Also, the experimental data set can be used for benchmarking buffering models...|$|R

The filling of cracks, fissures or voids in concrete for structural purposes (restoration of strength and load-bearing capability), or non-structural reasons (flexible repairs where further movement is expected, or alternately to resist water and gas permeation) typically involves the injection of low viscosity resins or grouts based on epoxy, PU or acrylic resins, or micronised cement slurries.|$|E
