5|$|The mould Penicillium roqueforti {{contributes}} {{the blue}} coloration {{and much of}} the flavour in blue cheeses such as Roquefort and <b>Stilton.</b> Mould fungi are processed to produce vegetarian meat substitutes such as Quorn.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{types of}} cheeses require {{inoculation}} of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as <b>Stilton</b> or Roquefort, {{which are made}} by inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti. Molds used in cheese production are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.|$|E
5|$|Sausages are {{commonly}} eaten, either as bangers and mash or toad in the hole. Lancashire hotpot {{is a well}} known stew in the northwest. Some {{of the more popular}} cheeses are Cheddar, Red Leicester and Wensleydale together with Blue <b>Stilton.</b> Many Anglo-Indian hybrid dishes, curries, have been created such as chicken tikka masala and balti. Traditional English dessert dishes include apple pie or other fruit pies; spotted dick – all generally served with custard; and, more recently, sticky toffee pudding. Sweet pastries include scones (either plain or containing dried fruit) served with jam and/or cream, dried fruit loaves, Eccles cakes and mince pies as well as a wide range of sweet or spiced biscuits. Common drinks include tea, whose popularity was increased by Catherine of Braganza, whilst frequently consumed alcoholic drinks include wines, ciders and English beers, such as bitter, mild, stout, and brown ale.|$|E
5|$|With Delilah {{being too}} {{powerful}} to defeat by normal means, Sokolov suggests the player investigate {{the home of}} mining magnate Aramis <b>Stilton</b> (Richard Cansino). Upon entering Stilton's mansion, the player discovers that he had gone insane after witnessing Delilah's resurrection. With {{the aid of a}} timepiece granted by the Outsider, the player travels back in time and observes the Duke, Jindosh, and Ashworth pull Delilah from the Void. Afterwards, Delilah siphons part of her soul into a statue, effectively making her immortal. The player invades the Duke's palace to eliminate him and retrieve Delilah's soul. After either killing the Duke or working with his body double to depose him, the player finds the statue and extracts Delilah's soul. With Delilah's soul in hand, the player returns to Dunwall for a final confrontation with Delilah. After reuniting Delilah with her soul, the player may choose to kill Delilah or trick her into trapping herself inside her own painting.|$|E
5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, mould fungi have been {{exploited}} to create {{a wide range of}} industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and truffle, while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the meaty (umami) flavour of fermented soybean products such as tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including Roquefort and <b>Stilton.</b> Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of ethnomycology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stilton</b> cheese {{originated}} near Melton Mowbray, and {{is still}} made in the town today. <b>Stilton</b> cheese {{takes its name from}} the village of <b>Stilton</b> in Huntingdonshire, where it was marketed to travellers on the Great North Road, though no <b>Stilton</b> was ever made there.|$|E

25|$|Peace {{was finally}} proclaimed with France in 1814, {{following}} Napoleon's defeat and consequent abdication. The prisoners, the garrison guards and local people joined together in celebrations. The remaining prisoners left the garrison by June of that year. A few decided {{to remain in}} England and settled near Yaxley and <b>Stilton.</b>|$|E
25|$|There was no prison chapel but a Catholic priest {{resided in}} the {{garrison}} barracks. From 1808, Stephen John Baptist Lewis de Galois de la Tours, the former Bishop of Moulins who was expelled from France in 1791 and lived {{a mile from the}} prison at <b>Stilton,</b> was permitted by the Admiralty to minister and provide charity to the prisoners at his own expense.|$|E
25|$|The major {{industrial}} {{use of this}} fungus is the production of blue cheeses, flavouring agents, antifungals, polysaccharides, proteases and other enzymes. The fungus has been a constituent of Roquefort, <b>Stilton,</b> Danish blue, Cabrales, Gorgonzola and other blue cheeses that humans {{are known to have}} eaten since approximately AD 50; blue cheese is mentioned in literature as far back as AD 79, when Pliny the Elder remarked upon its rich flavour.|$|E
25|$|The A15 is Peterborough's main {{connecting}} {{road from the}} south to the A1(M), joining near <b>Stilton,</b> at Norman Cross. It begins as London Road at junction 16 of the A1(M) with the B1043 (former A1) in Cambridgeshire {{and the district of}} North West Cambridgeshire. From here to Yaxley it passes the Norman Cross Hotel and follows the City of Peterborough and Cambridgeshire boundary, where there is a junction with the B1091 (for Farcet).|$|E
25|$|Providing {{barriers}} to entry. The drawing of boundaries around certain {{food and drink}} produce prevents other actors entering particular markets. On this point the PGS framework can potentially deny (or make extremely difficult) entry into the agro-food sector. For example, there are stringent geographical, productive, facilitative, planning, temporal and skilled constraints to entry into the <b>Stilton</b> cheese market in the UK. The successful application to protect the Cornish pasty is another recent example; with Ginsters of Cornwall central to the bid (itself owned by the ‘extra-local’, Leicestershire-based Samworth Brothers – also makers of fellow PGS protected Melton Mowbray Pork Pies).|$|E
25|$|The {{sweetness}} of wines {{is determined by}} the amount of residual sugar left in the wine after the fermentation process. Wines can be bone dry (with the sugars fully fermented into alcohol), off-dry (with a hint of sweetness), semi-dry (medium-sweet) and dessert level sweetness (such as the high sugar content in Sauternes and Tokays). Sweet wines often need to be sweeter than the dish they are served with. Vintage brut champagne paired with sweet, wedding cake can make the wine taste tart and weak while the cake will have off flavors. In food pairings, sweetness balances spice and heat. It can serve as a contrast to the heat and alleviate some of the burning sensation caused by peppers and spicy Asian cuisine. It can accentuate the mild sweetness in some foods and can also contrast with salt such as the European custom of pairing salty <b>Stilton</b> cheese with a sweet Port. Sweetness in a wine can balance tartness in food, especially if the food has some sweetness (such as dishes with sweet & sour sauces).|$|E
500|$|Although the officially {{protected}} Cornish pasty has {{a specific}} ingredients list, old Cornish cookery books show that pasties were generally made from whatever food was available. Indeed, the earliest recorded pasty recipes include venison, not beef. [...] "Pasty" [...] {{has always been}} a generic name for the shape and can contain a variety of fillings, including <b>stilton,</b> vegetarian and even chicken tikka. Pork and apple pasties are readily available in shops throughout Cornwall and Devon, with the ingredients including an apple flavoured sauce, mixed together throughout the pasty, as well as sweet pasties with ingredients such as apple and fig or chocolate and banana, which are common in some areas of Cornwall.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{acted as}} second to various fighters around {{the period of}} his rise and fall. He {{performed}} this duty for Tom Tyne ("The Tailor") at Croydon on 1 July 1788 and at Horton Moor on 24 March 1790, having previously done so for a fighter called Savage who had taken on Jack Doyle at Stepney Fields on 22 November 1787. He also acted twice for Humphries, in his fights against Mendoza at Odiham on 9 January 1788, when Mendoza sprained his ankle on the slippery surface, and at <b>Stilton</b> on 9 May 1789. There was much controversy at the latter, with O'Hara reporting that this caused Mendoza's second, a Captain Brown, to call Johnson a blackguard; Johnson responded by threatening [...] "to punch Brown into Eternity." [...] Johnson switched fighters and seconded Mendoza against Humphries at Doncaster on 29September 1790, and again in a contest against Warr near Croydon in May 1792. Similarly, he acted as second for Hooper when he fought George Maddox at [...] Sydenham Common on 10 February 1794 and for Tom [...] "Paddington" [...] Jones at Blackheath on 10 May 1794. Other occasions when he acted as second include for John Jackson (near to Croydon, 9 June 1788; and against Mendoza at Hornchurch on 15 April 1795), and Joe Ward (at Hyde Park, date unknown).|$|E

2500|$|The {{geographical}} limitations can {{be quite}} strict. [...] "Newcastle Brown Ale" [...] was restricted to being brewed {{in the city of}} Newcastle upon Tyne in England. However, having obtained this protection for their product, the brewery decided in 2004 that it would move across the river Tyne to Gateshead. As Gateshead is technically a separate town—albeit only the width of a river apart—it does not fall within the required geographical restriction. The brewery then applied to the European Union authorities to have the geographical restriction revoked. If the restriction had not been revoked, the brewery would have been forced either to move back to Newcastle, or stop calling its beer [...] "Newcastle" [...] brown ale. Ultimately, the brewery's application to revoke the geographic restriction was approved. Similarly, <b>Stilton</b> cheese can only be produced in the three English counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, and Nottinghamshire. <b>Stilton</b> village is in the traditional county of Huntingdonshire, now a district of Cambridgeshire, so <b>Stilton</b> cheese cannot be produced in <b>Stilton</b> (although it is unclear whether the cheese was ever produced there. Quenby Hall in Leicestershire claims to be the first producer).|$|E

2500|$|The chief {{industrial}} {{use of this}} species is the production of blue cheeses, such as its namesake Roquefort, Bleu de Bresse, Bleu du Vercors-Sassenage, Brebiblu, Cabrales, Cambozola (Blue Brie), Cashel Blue, Danish blue, Fourme d'Ambert, Fourme de Montbrison, Lanark Blue, Shropshire Blue and <b>Stilton,</b> and some varieties of Bleu d'Auvergne and Gorgonzola. [...] (Other blue cheeses, including Bleu de Gex and Rochebaron, use Penicillium glaucum.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Gorgonzola (voiced by Will Shadley): A young green rat {{apprentice}} candle holder with an unlikeable attitude. He shows jealousy over Chowder which is, in fact Chowder {{having a}} better job than him. He will occasionally use Chowder, and if forced, will partner with him in games. Since blue cheese {{was one of the few}} foods Greenblatt disliked, he decided to use the name [...] "gorgonzola" [...] for a character who did not get along with Chowder. Gorgonzola resembles a green opossum or a green rat. He wears tattered brown clothes and no shoes, and has a partially melted candle on his head (for traditional reasons). He is desperate to get cash, and will do almost anything to get it. Gorgonzola also loves to play Sniffleball, as seen in the episode Sniffleball. Despite his unpleasant and boastful attitude to Chowder, Chowder sees him as a close friend, which irritates him even more. Gorgonzola is an apprentice to <b>Stilton,</b> who is a candle holder, hence why both characters have burning candles on their heads.|$|E
2500|$|More exotic flavors are Thai sweet chili, roast {{pork and}} creamy mustard sauce, lime and Thai spices, chicken with Italian herbs, {{sea salt and}} cracked black pepper, sea salt and chardonnay wine vinegar, sea salt and cider vinegar, spicy and {{aromatic}} curry, turkey and bacon, caramelized onion and sweet balsamic vinegar, <b>Stilton</b> and cranberry, mango chili, and special flavors, such as American cheeseburger and English roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. Kettle Foods Ltd's range of thick-cut crunchy potato chips include gourmet flavors: Mexican limes {{with a hint of}} chilli, salsa with mesquite, buffalo mozzarella tomato and basil, mature cheddar with Adnams Broadside Beer, Soulmate cheeses, and onion. McCoys Crisps are also popular in the UK. In the north of England, Seabrook Potato Crisps are popular, but they are much less common in the south. Tayto is a popular brand in Northern Ireland. Since 2008, Walkers has launched its [...] "Do Us a Flavour" [...] campaign, challenging the UK public to think up unique flavours for their crisps. Six flavours were chosen from among the entries and released as special editions. Consumers could vote on their favourite, and the winner would become a permanent flavour.|$|E

There should be a burnished tablet let into the ground on the spot where some courageous man first ate <b>Stilton</b> cheese, and survived. On the top of a neighbouring hill (if there are any neighbouring hills) there should be a huge model of a <b>Stilton</b> cheese, made of some rich green marble and engraven with some haughty motto: I suggest something like 'Ver non semper viret; sed Stiltonia semper virescit.'"

60|$|A {{dinner of}} seven {{in an old}} London tavern--a good dinner, the memory whereof is not yet effaced from the tablets of the palate. A soup, a plate of white-bait be-lemoned and red-peppered with exactness, a huge joint of roast beef, from which we sliced at will, flanked by various bottles of old dry Sherry and crusty Port--such Port! (And we are {{expected}} to be patriots in a country where it cannot be procured! And the Portuguese are expected to love the country which, having it, sends it away!) That was the dinner--there was <b>Stilton</b> cheese; it were shameful not to mention the <b>Stilton.</b> Good, wholesome, and toothsome it was, rich and nutty. The <b>Stilton</b> that we get here, clouted in tin-foil, is monstrous poor stuff, hardly better than our American sort. After dinner there were walnuts and coffee and cigars. I cannot say much for the cigars; they are not over-good in England: too long at sea, I suppose.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This is Gorgonzola, main,' {{said the}} waiter, {{with a severe}} manner. 'And there's Camembert and Gruyere behind, and {{powdered}} Parmesan as well. I'm sorry that the <b>Stilton</b> don't give satisfaction.' ...|$|E

Colonel Chuttle knows that we are grateful for the <b>Stilton,</b> without having to be told so, and the Froplinsons {{know that we are}} bored with their calendar, whatever we may say to the contrary, just as we know that they are bored with the bridge-markers in spite of their written assurance that they thanked us for our charming little gift. What is more, the Colonel knows that even if we had taken a sudden aversion to <b>Stilton</b> or been forbidden it by the doctor, we should still have written a letter of hearty thanks around it. So you see the present system of acknowledgment is just as perfunctory and conventional as the counterfoil business would be, only ten times more tiresome and brain-racking.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} a relief," [...] the Marquis sighed, watching with satisfaction the arrival of half a <b>Stilton</b> cheese, a present from his son-in-law, [...] "a great relief to find a tenant like Mr. Thain." ...|$|E
