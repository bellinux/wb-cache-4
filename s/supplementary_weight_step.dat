40|$|AbstractMining {{height of}} coal seams {{plays a major}} role in the failure of the key stratum as well as combinational key stratum. Based on {{analyzing}} the relevant parameters of combinational key stratum, applying numerical analysis, the influence of mining height on combinational key stratum fracture, which is also the influence on the main roof <b>weighting</b> <b>step,</b> is studied and the computational formula of the main roof first <b>weighting</b> <b>step</b> in shallow seams is revised. The first <b>weighting</b> <b>step</b> of the Da-liu-ta 1203 working face, derived from the calculation through the revised formula, is very close to the actual measurement. The consistency proves that the revised formula has certain adaptability in calculating combinational key stratum <b>weighting</b> <b>step</b> in the thick loose layers shallow seams...|$|R

40|$|Ordinal {{regression}} is {{used for}} modelling an ordinal response variable {{as a function of}} some explanatory variables. The classical technique for estimating the unknown parameters of this model is Maximum Likelihood (ML). The lack of robustness of this estimator is formally shown by deriving its breakdown point and its influence function. To robustify the procedure, a <b>weighting</b> <b>step</b> is added to the Maximum Likelihood estimator, yielding an estimator with bounded influence function. We also show that the loss in efficiency due to the <b>weighting</b> <b>step</b> remains limited. A diagnostic plot based on the Weighted Maximum Likelihood estimator allows to detect outliers of different types in a single plot.

40|$|A short review {{has been}} made of the {{experimental}} studies performed in man, in which the effect of dexfenfluramine (D-F) on resting energy expenditure has been explored. It appears that the extent to which D-F possesses thermogenic properties (in addition to its anorectic effect) still remains controversial. Some investigators found either no significant increase in energy expenditure in response to the drug or a moderate effect in post-absorptive and/or postprandial state. It may be reasonable to assume that the <b>supplementary</b> <b>weight</b> loss observed with D-F as compared to a placebo can be primarily attributed to its anorectic effect rather than to its putative thermogenic effect...|$|R

40|$|According to state-of-the-art, an LCA (Ecobalance) {{encompasses}} also a weighting and/or {{an interpretation}} of inventory and impact assessment data. This step often leads to controversial debate. In a broadly based project group of LCA practicioners and users from industry, science, environmental and consumer organisations {{as well as from}} the authorities (ministry and UBA), consensus oriented elements were developed about the weighting process and weighting methods. Thereby, no specific method was developed, but aspects of the <b>weighting</b> <b>step</b> were shown and described in view of their consensus potential. The results cover a fundamental document ('Grundsatzpapier', cf. part I 'Projektbericht'), a detailed list of consensus points, a checklist on the <b>weighting</b> <b>step</b> in LCA/ecobalances as well as a synoptic description of a number of weighting approaches used in german LCA practice (cf. part II, 'Projektdokumentation').

The <b>weighting</b> <b>step</b> is not required in the eco-costs system, since the total result is the sum of the eco-costs of all midpoints.The advantage of such a calculation is that the marginal prevention costs are related to the cost of the most expensive Best Available Technology which is needed to meet the target, and the corresponding level of Tradable Emission Rights which is required in future. Example: For reduction of CO2 emissions to a sustainable level, the marginal prevention costs are the costs of replacement of coal-fired power plants by windmill parks at the sea.|$|R

40|$|Large-scale {{longwall}} mining of shallow coal seams may cause mining-induced fractures that can project completely {{through to the}} surface. This {{could lead to a}} series of mine safety and environmental issues, further deteriorating the already fragile ecological environment in the Western mining areas in China. Therefore, an accurate and effective understanding of the spatiotemporal evolution law of mining-induced fractures in overlying strata and its relationship to upper aquifers is critical. In this paper, the application of the geophysical-chemical properties of radon in mining engineering is explored as a potential solution to the shortcomings of existing surveying methods. A radioactive measurement method is proposed for the detection of the development of mining-induced fractures from overlying strata to the surface in the Baoshan Coal Mine (BCM). The on-site test indicated that the first <b>weighting</b> <b>step</b> is approximately 60 m, the average periodic <b>weighting</b> <b>step</b> is approximately 20 m, and the influence coverage of the advanced abutment pressure is approximately 30 m. The presented method could be used as an indirect technical support to increase the safety of coal mining by acting as a simple, fast, and reliable method of detecting mining-induced fractures in overlying strata...|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, an {{additional}} particularity of the PIAAC {{study should be}} mentioned. Following international standards, the procedure for weighting the German PIAAC data consisted of several steps (Martin et al. 2013; Zabal et al. 2014). While age and gender had {{to be included in}} the set of variables for the final <b>weighting</b> <b>step,</b> there was no guideline regarding the inclusion of further variables, such as citizenship or country of birth (OECD 2010). Weighting adjustment for nonresponse, however, included the variables citizenship (German vs. non-German), age, and municipality size. In the final <b>weighting</b> <b>step</b> (benchmarking to external data), the German PIAAC data were adjusted to data from the 2010 Microcensus 4 for age, gender, region, and education level (Zabal et al. 2014). Citizenship was not considered in this step in order to ensure both the inclusion of the most essential variables and the minimization of the number of weighting cells. Even though citizenship was used at some point during the weighting process, (similarly to other countries), it was not benchmarked to population totals in the final step, so that an almost perfect alignment could not be achieved. As a result, the weighted proportion of non-German individuals in the PIAAC sample was 9.4 %, compared to 10.7 % in the 2010 Microcensus data (Zabal et al. 2014, p. 88).|$|R
