Root exudates and organic acids released during decomposition of {{soil organic matter}} can affect the availability of Zn. Thus, this hydroponic experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of some chelates on Zn uptake and translocation in two wheat genotypes with different zinc-efficiency. Two wheat genotypes (Triticum aestivum L. <b>Back</b> <b>Cross</b> Rowshan as zinc-efficient and Kavir as zinc-inefficient) were exposed to two levels of zinc (10 and 100 µM) and six different carboxylic acids (citric, tartaric, oxalic, salicylic, ethylenediamin tetraacetic acid and L-methionine). Results showed that uptake capability of free and complexed species of Zn were completely different. Zn 2 + activity in nutrient solution had negative correlation with shoot dry weight and positive correlation with shoot zinc concentration in Kavir genotype, while complexed species had opposite results. <b>Back</b> <b>Cross</b> Rowshan genotype showed opposite results in comparison with Kavir genotype. The response of wheat genotypes to different organic acids varied. EDTA treatment caused the lowest shoot zinc concentration in Kavir genotype (18. 8 mg/kg), while the <b>Back</b> <b>Cross</b> Rowshan genotype had highest concentration (99. 5 mg/kg). Tartaric acid and citric acid caused the lowest root Zn concentration in the Kavir genotype (26. 7 and 58. 6 mg/kg, respectively), while the highest content was observed in the <b>Back</b> <b>Cross</b> Rowshan genotype (83. 2 and 98. 1 mg/kg, respectively). Catalase activity had inverse relationship with root Zn concentration in both genotypes. According {{to the results of}} this research, different responses of the wheat genotypes to organic acids are related to different mechanisms of zinc-efficiency in genotypes...|$|R

50|$|Current {{efforts are}} under way by the Forest Health Initiative to use modern {{breeding}} techniques and genetic engineering to create resistant tree strains, with contributions from SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Penn State, the University of Georgia, and the US Forest Service. One {{of the most successful}} methods of breeding is to create a <b>back</b> <b>cross</b> of a resistant species (such as one from China or Japan) and American chestnut. Researchers identified 2 or 3 genes that allow for blight resistance, and are focusing on giving the American Chestnut hybrids only those genes from the Chinese or Japanese chestnut. The two species are first bred to create a 50/50 hybrid. After three <b>back</b> <b>crosses</b> with American chestnut, the remaining genome is approximate 1/16 that of the resistant tree, and 15/16 American. The strategy is to select blight-resistance genes during the <b>back</b> <b>crossing,</b> while preserving the more wild-type traits of American chestnut as the dominant phenotype. Thus, the newly bred hybrid chestnut trees should reach the same heights as the original American chestnut. Many of these 15/16 American chestnut hybrids have been planted along the East Coast, including in the Jefferson National Forest and on the Flight 93 National Memorial. Some of these sites have had researchers check on the saplings that have been planted to see their survival rate. For the hybrids to do well, they need areas with decent drainage and abundant sunlight. Meeting these needs can be hard to do, so not all restoration areas have been successful with hybrid survival.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the linearly constrained separable convex programming whose objective function is separable into m individual convex functions with non-overlapping variables. The alternating direction method (ADM) {{has been well}} studied in the literature for the special case m = 2. But the convergence of extending ADM to the general case m ≥ 3 is still open. In this paper, we show that the straightforward extension of ADM is valid for the general case m ≥ 3 if a Gaussian <b>back</b> <b>substitution</b> procedure is combined. The resulting ADM with Gaussian <b>back</b> <b>substitution</b> is a novel approach towards the extension of ADM from m = 2 to m ≥ 3, and its algorithmic framework is new in the literature. For the ADM with Gaussian <b>back</b> <b>substitution,</b> we prove its convergence via the analytic framework of contractive type methods and we show its numerical efficiency by some application problems.
