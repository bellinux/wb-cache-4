40|$|A lot {{of image}} {{analysis}} problems {{lend themselves to}} a unified mathematical formulation as optimization problems. Tree-serial dynamic programming is a particular case of the so-called nonserial dynamic programming designed for optimization of objective functions which are sums of partial functions each of {{a smaller number of}} variables. It is known that these problems are NP-hard in the general formulation, but, when the adjacency graph is a tree, they can be effectively solved by the tree-serial dynamic programming procedure.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient Gaussian process inference scheme for modeling shortscale phenomena in spatio-temporal datasets. Our model uses a sum of <b>separable,</b> compactly <b>supported</b> covariance <b>functions,</b> which yields a full covariance matrix represented {{in terms of}} small sparse matrices operating either on the spatial or temporal domain. The proposed inference procedure is based on Gibbs sampling, in which samples from the conditional distribution of the latent function values are obtained by applying a simple linear transformation to samples drawn from the joint distribution of the function values and the observations. We {{make use of the}} proposed model structure and the conjugate gradient method to compute the required transformation. In the experimental part, the proposed algorithm is compared to the standard approach using the sparse Cholesky decomposition and it is shown to be much faster and computationally feasible for 100 – 1000 times larger datasets. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in the problem of reconstructing sea surface temperature, which requires processing of a real-world dataset with 106 observations. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Some {{properties}} of Borel measures with <b>separable</b> <b>supports</b> are considered. In particular, it is proved that any σ-finite Borel measure on a Suslin line has a <b>separable</b> <b>supports</b> {{and from this}} fact it is deduced, using the continuum hypothesis, that any Suslin line contains a Luzin subspace with the cardinality of the continuum. Let E be a topological space. We say that the space E has the property (S) if for every σ-finite Borel measure µ defined in this space there exists a <b>separable</b> <b>support,</b> i. e., a separable closed set F (µ) ⊂ E such that µ(E (µ)) = 0. Let us consider some examples of topological spaces having the property (S). Example 1. It is obvious that any separable topological space E has the property (S). Example 2. Let E be an arbitrary metric space whose topological weight is not measurable in a wide sense. Then according to the well-known result from the topological measure theory the space E has the property (S). Example 3. Let E be the Alexandrov compactification of some discrete topological space. Then the following statements are equivalent: a) the space E has the property (S); b) card(E) is not measurable in a wide sense. Example 4. Let E be a Hausdorff topological space. We say that E is a Luzin space if every σ-finite diffused (i. e., continuous) Borel measure defined in E is identically zero. The classical Luzin set on the real line R is a Luzin topological space (about Luzin sets see, for example, [1]). One can easily check that any σ-finite Borel measure defined in the Luzin topological spac...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A theorem on the {{existence}} of <b>separable</b> <b>supports</b> of σ-finite Borel measures given on metric spaces with small topological weights is applied to constructions of certain analogues of special subsets of the real line. A well-known result from topological measure theory states that every σ-finite Borel measure on a metric space whose weight is not real-valued measurable possesses a <b>separable</b> <b>support</b> (cf. [7] and [10]). The main goal of the present article is to demonstrate several applications of this result to some generalized analogues of classical subsets of the real line R (e. g. Luzin sets, Sierpiński sets and so on). We assume that all topological spaces E under consideration below sat-isfy the following condition: all one-element subsets of E are Borel (in E). The symbol ω denotes, as usual, the first infinite cardinal, ω 1 — the first uncountable cardinal and c denotes the cardinality continuum. We recall that E is a universal measure zero space (or universally negli-gible space) if there is no nonzero σ-finite diffused Borel measure on E. The so-called Luzin subsets of the real line R yield nontrivial examples of uncountable universal measure zero spaces. According to the classica...|$|R
