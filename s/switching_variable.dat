40|$|A new large-signal {{nonlinear}} {{control technique}} is proposed {{to control the}} duty-ratio d of a switch such that in each cycle the average value of a <b>switched</b> <b>variable</b> of the <b>switching</b> converter is exactly equal to or proportional to the control reference in the steady-state or in a transient. One-cycle control rejects power source perturbations in one switching cycle; the average value of the <b>switched</b> <b>variable</b> follows the dynamic reference in one switching cycle; and the controller corrects switching errors in one switching cycle. There is no steady-state error nor dynamic error between the control reference and the average value of the <b>switched</b> <b>variable.</b> Experiments with a constant frequency buck converter have demonstrated the robustness of the control method and verified the theoretical predictions. This new control method is very general and applicable to all types of pulse-width-modulated, resonant-based, or soft-switched switching converters for either voltage or current control in continuous or discontinuous conduction mode.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we discuss Bayesian {{estimation}} of a very general model class where {{the distribution of the}} observations is assumed to depend on a latent mixture or <b>switching</b> <b>variable</b> taking values in a discrete state space. This model class covers e. g. finite mixture modelling, Markov switching autoregressive modelling and dynamic linear models with switching. Joint Bayesian estimation of all latent variables, model parameters and parameters determining the probability law of the <b>switching</b> <b>variable</b> is carried out by a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo method called permutation sampling. Estimation of switching and mixture models is known to be faced with identifiability problems as switching and mixture are identifiable only up to permutations of the indices of the states. For a Bayesian analysis the posterior has to be constrained {{in such a way that}} identifiablity constraints are fulfilled. The permutation sampler is designed to sample efficiently from the constrained posterior, by first sampling from the unconstrained posterior - which often can be done in a convenient multimove manner - and then by applying a suitable permutation, if the identifiability constraint is violated. We present simple conditions on the prior which ensure that this method is a valid Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (that is invariance, irreducibility and aperiodicity hold). Three case studies are presented, including finite mixture modelling of fetal lamb data, Markov switching Autoregressive modelling of the U. S. quarterly real GDP data, and modelling the U. S. /U.

40|$|Abstract. Compact {{representations}} of switching functions provide for simplified realizations of logic networks. Recent advent of digital technology and VLSI raised a considerable interest in polynomial expressions for switching functions. Complexity of these expressions is estimated through {{the number of}} product terms. For a given function and the selected class of polynomial expressions, the number of products can be reduced by a suitable selection of polarities for <b>switching</b> <b>variables,</b> which results in Fixed Polarity Polynomial Expressions (FPPEs). This paper proposes a method for optimization of polynomial representation of switching functions. The method exploits the notion of dual polarity of <b>switching</b> <b>variables</b> and takes advantages of a simple relationship between two FPPEs for dual polarities. Calculation of FPPEs is performed along the extended dual polarity route so that each FPPE is calculated from its extended dual polarity FPPE. Conversion from one FPPE to another is carried out by using one-bit check, which ensures {{the efficiency of the}} method. The proposed method can be applied to arbitrary polynomial expressions providing that the corresponding transform matrix has the Kronecker product structure. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-stage 18 -level inverter design {{with a novel}} control method. The inverter consists of a series-connected main high-voltage, medium-voltage, and low-voltage stages. The high-voltage stage is made of a three-phase, six-switch conventional inverter. The medium- and low-voltage stages are made of three-level inverters constructed by H-bridge units. The proposed control strategy assumes a reference-input voltage vector and aims to operate the inverter in one state per sampling time to produce the nearest vector to that reference. The control concept is based on representing the reference voltage in 60 Â°-spaced two-axis coordinate system. In this system, the inverter vectors dimensions are integer multiples of the inverters dc voltage, and {{the expression of the}} inverters vectors in terms of its <b>switching</b> <b>variables</b> is straightforward. Consequently, the switching signals can be obtained by simple fixed-point calculations. The approach of the proposed control strategy has been presented, the transformed inverter vectors and their relation to the <b>switching</b> <b>variables</b> have been defined, and the implementation process has been described. The test results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in terms of computational efficiency as well as the capability of the inverter to produce very low distorted voltage with low-switching losses...|$|R

40|$|Input-Output {{buffered}} crossbars {{are popular}} {{building blocks for}} scalable high-speed switching because they require minimum speed-up of memory bandwidth. Scaling the design of crossbar switches to large capacities is limited by technology {{issues such as the}} reconfiguration of highspeed fabrics or power consumption. In addition, when crossbar architectures are used in the context of IP networks where packets are of variable size, they typically schedule and transfer fixed size envelopes. Incoming packets are fragmented into envelopes and this fragmentation can lead to, possibly large [1], loss of bandwidth and instability. This paper proposes a new method for <b>switching</b> <b>variable</b> sized packets over a crossbar switch that i) allows maximum utilization of switch bandwidth and avoids the fragmentation effect, and ii) allows designers to use much larger envelopes for transfering data over the fabric that minimizes the reconfiguration frequency of the fabric.
