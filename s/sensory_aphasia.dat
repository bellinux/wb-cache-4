40|$|Introduction: The arcuate {{fasciculus}} (AF) is a {{key component}} for language repetition Neuroimaging evidence indicates a gender-dimorphic architecture of this white matter tract. Strong left lateralization of the direct segment of the AF is m∼ore frequent in men (85 %), while mild lateralization or symmetrical bilateral ∼ representation (60 %) is more prevalent amongst women. Therefore, most men {{do not have a}} well-developed right AF. This predicts that men with aphasia and left hemisphere damage will have less capacity than aphasic women to compensate repetition deficits and, consequently, aphasias associated to repetition deficits (e. g conduction aphasia – CA) will be more prevalent in men. While this assumption is intuitively appealing, it has not been empirically tested up to now. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published cases of CA and transcortical aphasia (TA) was performed. Adult patients with first-ever unilateral cerebrovascular event and no prior history of neurological or psychiatric disease were included in the database. The men: women proportion of CA and TA was calculated from the database, and compared with the men:women proportion of stroke prevalence. The group of patients with aphasias showing relatively preserved repetition (transcortical motor and <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasias)</b> was used as control. Patients with mixed transcortical aphasia were excluded because repetition is not fully preserved. Results: Two hundred fifty three publications were included, gathering 799 cases of CA and TA. Males accounted for 74 % (n = 375) of CA subjects (n = 507), while among TA (n= 249, mixed TA excluded) men represented 62 % (n= 154) of subjects. Compared with 59 % of male prevalence in stroke, men were overrepresented amongst CA (p< 0. 0001, 95 % CI 68. 91 to 76. 82) in comparison with the control group (TA with exclusion of mixed TA, p= 0. 2848, 95 % CI 55. 50 to 67. 91). Discussion:Chronic repetition deficits are more prevalent in men than in women. This finding has important implications for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of aphasia in men, since verbal repetition is a major resource in language therapy. References: Catani M et al.

50|$|The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE-3) {{provides}} a comprehensive exploration {{of a range}} of communicative abilities. The results of the BDAE are used to classify patient's language profiles into one of the localization based classifications of aphasia: Broca's, Wernicke's, anomic, conduction, transcortical, transcortical motor, transcortical <b>sensory,</b> and global <b>aphasia</b> syndromes, although the test does not always provide a diagnosis or a therapeutic approach. The assessment does provide you with a severity rating. The Examination is designed to go beyond simple functional definitions of aphasia into the components of language dysfunctions (symptoms) that have been shown to underlie the various aphasic syndromes. Thus, this test evaluates various perceptual modalities (e.g., auditory, visual, and gestural), processing functions (e.g., comprehension, analysis, problem-solving), and response modalities (e.g., writing, articulation, and manipulation). This approach allows for the neuropsychological analysis and measurement of language-related skills and abilities from both ideographic and nomothetic bases, as well as a comprehensive approach to the symptom configurations that relate to neuropathologic conditions. The test is divided into five subtests and include assessment of conversation and expository speech (simple social responses, free conversation, and picture description), auditory comprehension (at the word-level, sentence level, and complex ideational material), oral expression (automatized sequences, repetition, and naming) , reading (basic symbol recognition, number matching, word identification-picture-word matching, oral reading, and reading comprehension), and writing (mechanics, encoding skills, written picture naming, and narrative writing).|$|R
25|$|<b>Sensory</b> <b>aphasia</b> is {{typically}} diagnosed by non-invasive evaluations. Neurologists, neuropsychologists or speech pathologists will administer oral evaluations {{to determine the}} extent of a patient’s comprehension and speech capability. Initial assessment will determine if the cause of linguistic deficiency is aphasia. If the diagnosis is then confirmed, testing will next address the type of aphasia and its severity. The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination specializes in determining the severity of a <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasia</b> through the observation of conversational behaviors. Several modalities of perception and response are observed in conjunction with the subject’s ability to process sensory information. The location of the brain lesion and type of the aphasia can then be inferred from the observed symptoms. The Minnesota Test for Differential Diagnosis is the most lengthy and thorough assessment of <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasia.</b> It pinpoints weaknesses in the auditory and visual senses, as well as reading comprehension. From this differential diagnosis, a patient’s course of treatment can be determined. After treatment planning, the Porch Index of Communicative Ability is used to evaluate prognosis and the degree of recovery.|$|E
25|$|In all {{of these}} ways, TSA {{is very similar to}} a more {{commonly}} known language disorder, receptive aphasia. However, transcortical <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasia</b> differs from receptive aphasia in that patients still have intact repetition and exhibit echolalia, or the compulsive repetition of words. Transcortical <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasia</b> cannot be diagnosed through brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as the results are often difficult to interpret. Therefore, clinicians rely on language assessments and observations to determine if a patient presents with the characteristics of TSA. Patients diagnosed with TSA have shown partial recovery of speech and comprehension after beginning speech therapy. Speech therapy methods for patients with any subtype of aphasia are based on the principles of learning and neuroplasticity. Clinical research on TSA is limited because it occurs so infrequently in patients with aphasia that {{it is very difficult to}} perform systematic studies.|$|E
25|$|Transcortical <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasia</b> (TSA) {{is a kind}} of aphasia that {{involves}} damage to specific areas of the temporal lobe of the brain, resulting in symptoms such as poor auditory comprehension, relatively intact repetition, and fluent speech with semantic paraphasias present. TSA is a fluent aphasia similar to Wernicke's aphasia, {{with the exception of a}} strong ability to repeat words and phrases. The person may repeat questions rather than answer them ("echolalia").|$|E
40|$|Cavernous {{hemangioma}} consists {{mainly of}} congenital vascular malformations present before birth and gradually increasing in size with skeletal growth. A {{small number of}} patients with cavernous hemangioma develop scoliosis, and surgical treatment for the scoliosis in such cases has not been reported to date. Here we report a 12 -year-old male patient with severe progressive scoliosis due to a huge subcutaneous cavernous hemangioma, who underwent posterior correction and fusion surgery. Upon referral to our department, radiographs revealed a scoliosis of 85 ° at T 6 -L 1 and a kyphosis of 58 ° at T 4 -T 10. CT and MR images revealed a huge hemangioma extending from the subcutaneous region to the paraspinal muscles and the retroperitoneal space and invading the spinal canal. Posterior correction and fusion surgery using pedicle screws between T 2 and L 3 were performed. Massive hemorrhage from the hemangioma occurred during the surgery, with intraoperative blood loss reaching 2800 ml. The scoliosis was corrected to 59 °, and the kyphosis to 45 ° after surgery. Seven hours after surgery, the patient suffered from hypovolemic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation due to postoperative hemorrhage from the hemangioma. The patient developed <b>sensory</b> and conduction <b>aphasia</b> caused by cerebral hypoxia during the shock {{on the day of}} the surgery. At present, two years after the surgery, although the patient has completely recovered from the aphasia. This case illustrates that, in correction surgery for scoliosis due to huge subcutaneous cavernous hemangioma, intraoperative and postoperative intensive care for hemodynamics should be performed, since massive hemorrhage can occur during the postoperative period as well as the intraoperative period...|$|R
40|$|Atypical imaging {{features}} of multiple sclerosis lesions include size > 2 cm, mass effect, oedema and/or ring enhancement. This constellation {{is often referred}} to as ‘tumefactive multiple sclerosis’. Previous series emphasize their unifocal and clinically isolated nature, however, evolution of these lesions is not well defined. Biopsy may be required for diagnosis. We describe clinical and radiographic features in 168 patients with biopsy confirmed CNS inflammatory demyelinating disease (IDD). Lesions were analysed on pre- and post-biopsy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for location, size, mass effect/oedema, enhancement, multifocality and fulfilment of Barkhof criteria. Clinical data were correlated to MRI. Female to male ratio was 1. 2 : 1, median age at onset, 37 years, duration between symptom onset and biopsy, 7. 1 weeks and total disease duration, 3. 9 years. Clinical course prior to biopsy was a first neurological event in 61 %, relapsing–remitting in 29 % and progressive in 4 %. Presentations were typically polysymptomatic, with motor, cognitive and <b>sensory</b> symptoms predominating. <b>Aphasia,</b> agnosia, seizures and visual field defects were observed. At follow-up, 70 % developed definite multiple sclerosis, and 14 % had an isolated demyelinating syndrome. Median time to second attack was 4. 8 years, and median EDSS at follow-up was 3. 0. Multiple lesions were present in 70 % on pre-biopsy MRI, and in 83 % by last MRI, with Barkhof criteria fulfilled in 46 % prior to biopsy and 55 % by follow-up. Only 17 % of cases remained unifocal. Median largest lesion size on T 2 -weighted images was 4 cm (range 0. 5 – 12), with a discernible size of 2. 1 cm (range 0. 5 – 7. 5). Biopsied lesions demonstrated mass effect in 45 % and oedema in 77 %. A strong association was found between lesion size, and presence of mass effect and/or oedema (P 5 cm was associated with a slightly higher EDSS at last follow-up, long-term prognosis in patients with disease duration > 10 years was better (EDSS 1. 5) compared with a population-based multiple sclerosis cohort matched for disease duration (EDSS 3. 5; P < 0. 001). Given the retrospective nature of the study, the precise reason for biopsy could not always be determined. This study underscores the diagnostically challenging nature of CNS IDDs that present with atypical clinical or radiographic features. Most have multifocal disease at onset, and develop RRMS by follow-up. Although increased awareness of this broad spectrum may obviate need for biopsy in many circumstances, an important role for diagnostic brain biopsy may be required in some cases...|$|R

25|$|Transcortical aphasias include transcortical motor aphasia, transcortical <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasia,</b> {{and mixed}} transcortical aphasia. Patients with transcortical motor aphasia {{typically}} have intact comprehension {{and awareness of}} their errors, but poor word finding and speech production. Patients with transcortical sensory and mixed transcortical aphasia have poor comprehension and unawareness of their errors. Despite poor comprehension and more severe deficits in some transcortical aphasias, small {{studies have indicated that}} full recovery is possible for all types of transcortical aphasia.

25|$|Transcortical <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasia</b> {{is caused}} by lesions in the {{inferior}} left temporal lobe of the brain located near Wernicke's area, and is usually due to minor hemorrhage or contusion in the temporal lobe, or infarcts of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA). One function of the arcuate fasciculus is the connection between Wernicke’s and Broca’s area. In TSA Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas are spared, meaning that lesions do not occur in these regions of the brain. However, since the arcuate fasciculus, Wernicke's area, and Broca's area are secluded {{from the rest of}} the brain in TSA, patients still have intact repetition (as information from the arcuate fasciculus is relayed to Broca’s area), but cannot attach meaning to words, either spoken or heard.|$|E

2500|$|Transcortical <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasia</b> is {{characterized}} as a fluent aphasia. Fluency is determined by direct qualitative observation of the patient’s speech to determine the length of spoken phrases, and is usually characterized by a normal or rapid rate; normal phrase length, rhythm, melody, and articulatory agility; and normal or paragrammatic speech. Transcortical <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasia</b> is a disorder {{in which there is}} a discrepancy between phonological processing, which remains intact, and lexical-semantic processing, which is impaired. Therefore, patients can repeat complicated phrases, however they lack comprehension and propositional speech. This disconnect occurs since Wernicke’s area is not damaged in patients with TSA, therefore repetition is spared while comprehension is affected. Patients with intact repetition can repeat both simple and complex phrases spoken by others, e.g. when asked if the patient would like to go for a walk, he or she would respond [...] "go for walk." [...] Although patients can respond appropriately, due to the extent of their TSA, it is most likely that they do not comprehend what others ask them. In addition to problems in comprehension, transcortical <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasia</b> is further characterized based on deficits in naming and paraphasia.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{classification}} schemes adopting this approach, {{such as the}} [...] "Boston-Neoclassical Model", also group these classical aphasia subtypes {{into two}} larger classes: the nonfluent aphasias (which encompasses Broca's aphasia and transcortical motor aphasia) and the fluent aphasias (which encompasses Wernicke's aphasia, conduction aphasia and transcortical <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasia).</b> These schemes also identify several further aphasia subtypes, including: anomic aphasia, which {{is characterized by a}} selective difficulty finding the names for things; and global aphasia, where both expression and comprehension of speech are severely compromised.|$|E
2500|$|A {{relatively}} new method of language therapy involves coincidence learning.

Therapists use coincidence learning to find and improve language correlations or coincidences that have been either damaged or deleted by severe cases of aphasia, such as transcortical <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasia.</b> This technique is important in brain function and recovery, as it strengthens associated brain areas that remain unaffected after brian damage. [...] It can be achieved with intensive therapy hours in order to maximize time where correlation is emphasized.|$|E
2500|$|Intending to {{ameliorate}} symptoms {{in those with}} violent and intractable conditions rather than effect a cure, Burckhardt began operating on patients in December 1888, but both his surgical methods and instruments were crude {{and the results of}} the procedure were mixed at best.

Complications included motor weakness, epilepsy, <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasia</b> and [...] "word deafness".

2500|$|In December 1888 Burckhardt, who {{had little}} {{experience}} of surgery, performed what are commonly {{regarded as the}} first series of modern psychosurgical operations. He operated on six patients under his care, two women and four men aged between 26 and 51 whose condition was deemed to be intractable. [...] Their diagnoses were, variously, one of chronic mania, one of primary dementia and four of primäre Verrücktheit (primary paranoid psychosis). This latter diagnosis was, according to the clinician-historian German E. Berrios, [...] "a clinical category that (anachronistically) {{should be considered as}} tantamount to schizophrenia". Burckhardt's case notes recorded that the patients all exhibited serious psychiatric symptoms such as auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, aggression, excitement and violence. The operations excised regions of the cerebral cortex, specifically removing sections of the frontal, temporal, and tempoparietal lobes. The results were not overly encouraging as one patient died five days after the operation after experiencing epileptic convulsions, one improved but later committed suicide, another two showed no change, and the last two patients became [...] "quieter". Complications consequent to the procedure included epilepsy (in two patients), motor weakness, [...] "word deafness" [...] and <b>sensory</b> <b>aphasia.</b> Only two patients are recorded as having no complications.|$|E

In 1877 he published a historical treatment of psychiatric and psychological theories of the functional regions of the brain. In this article he proposed that there were [...] "cortical dispersion centres" [...] which were [...] "rooted in physiology and anatomy in the brain" [...] and that these {{played a crucial role in}} the development of mental illness. Burckhardt drew inspiration for his hypothesis from recent advances which had shown the localisation of language faculties in the brain and he believed that mental diseases were also traceable to specific cortical centres. In the application of internal medicine to psychiatry, his research activities extended to an exploration of the relationship between mental illness and bodily temperature, blood pressure and pulse. In 1881 he published on the relationship between cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption and posited a connection between cerebral oxygen deprivation, pathological brain circulation and mental illness.
