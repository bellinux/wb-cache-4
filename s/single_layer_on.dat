For the sauce, originally fresh white tuna (in most restaurants canned tuna is used today to reduce cost and preparation time) is simmered until fully cooked in white wine, cider vinegar, white onion and garlic, and then puréed with a mix of olive and vegetable oil and egg yolks in an electric blender or food processor to form a thick mayonnaise. For the mayonnaise a variety of seasonings can be used, including anchovies, cayenne pepper and lemon juice.

It is shown that the reactivity of the Ag substrate with the Si atoms is important. The formation of Si nanoribbons on Ag(110) is accompanied by a missing-row reconstruction of the Ag surface, and the removed Ag atoms form additional islands. The mechanism of Si island formation on Ag(111) involves the insertion of single Si atoms within the Ag top layer and the exchange with Ag atoms. The released Ag atoms diffuse to steps edges and form new Ag fingers.
