The template has a universal tail hybridized with the U-MB and the remaining sequence is complementary {{to one of the}} restriction endonuclease digestion products.

In the work described here, homogenous assays were performed with the restriction endonucleases AluI, EcoRI, XhoI, and Sacl at smoothly controlled temperature. Cleavage efficiencies were determined, and the potential applications of this method were discussed. Furthermore, the AluI and EcoRI cleavage reactions were monitored online at varying substrate concentrations at the molecular level, and K(m), V(max), and K(cat) Values were calculated.

40|$|Infection of Escherichia coli by {{bacteriophage}} T 2 {{was accompanied}} by a rapid but transient increase in the rate of loss of small molecules from the bacterial cells. This transient leakage was studied with radioactive labels such as 42 K and 28 Mg. Bacteriophage-induced leakage was dependent on the ratio of phage to bacteria: the higher the multiplicity of infection, the greater the leakage. No leakage occurred at 4 C [when adsorption proceeds but injection of phage deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is blocked]. Leakage was caused by heavily irradiated phage as well as by normal phage; therefore, the intracellular functioning of the bacteriophage DNA was not required. This conclusion was supported by experiments which showed phage-induced leakage in the presence of chloramphenicol or sodium cyanide. Leakage could be prevented by infecting the bacteria with phage in the presence of high magnesium concentrations. Phage-induced leakage was terminated by a “sealing” reaction, after which potassium turnover by infected and uninfected cells was very similar. The <b>sealing</b> <b>reaction</b> occurred even in the presence of chloramphenicol, suggesting that the sealing is controlled by bacterial and not bacteriophage genes.

Characterization of the residue from wood liquefaction provides a new approach to understand some fundamental aspects of the liquefaction reaction.

The Klason lignin content of the residues decreased, while the holocellulose and a-cellulose contents increased as the phenol to wood ratio (P/W) increased. A peak at 1735 cm-', which was attributed to the ester carbony 1 group in xylan, disappeared in the FTIR spectra of the residues from liquefied wood under a <b>sealed</b> <b>reaction</b> sys-tem, indicating significantly different effects of atmospheric versus sealed liquefaction.

The compounds were heated with water at 330 degrees C in <b>sealed</b> <b>reaction</b> vessels for durations ranging from 1 to 17 days. Iron oxide and sulfide minerals, formic acid, or sodium for-mate were included in some experiments to vary conditions within the reaction vessel. Phenanthrene was unreactive both in water alone and {{in the presence of}} minerals for up to 17 days, while anthracene was partially hydrogenated (5 - 10 %) to di- and tetrahydroanthracene. In the presence of 6 - 21 vol % formic acid, both phenanthrene and anthracene reacted extensively to form hydrogenated and minor methylated derivatives, with the degree of hydrogenation and methylation increasing with the amount of formic acid. Phenanthrene was slightly hydrogenated in sodium formate solutions. The hydrogenation reactions could be readily reversed; heating a mixture of polysaturated phenanthrenes resulted in extensive dehydrogenation (aromatization) after 3 days at 330 degrees C. While the experiments demonstrate that reaction pathways for the hydrogenation of PAH under hydrothermal conditions exist, the reactions apparently require higher concentrations of H 2 than are typical of geologic settings. The experiments provide additional evidence that PAH may be generated in hydrothermal systems from progressive aromatization and dealkylation of biologically derived polycyclic precursors such as steroids and terpenoids.

Following a preface and a catalogue of elixir names, there is a set of detailed specifications for necessities of the laboratory, including the liuyini 六一泥 [...] "six-one" [...] lute which was universally employed in Chinese pharmacology and alchemy for the hermetical <b>sealing</b> of <b>reaction</b> vessels. Finally, there are the recipes themselves: ingredients grouped at the beginning, with weight and advance preparation clearly noted, and perspicacious, concise directions for compounding and using the products.|$|R
30|$|The {{conversion}} of furfural into FAL {{was performed in}} a 10  mL Teflonlined stainless steel autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer. In a typical experiment, furfural (1  mmol), isopropanol (5  mL), and {{a certain amount of}} catalysts were introduced into the reactor. After <b>sealing,</b> the <b>reaction</b> mixture was stirred and allowed to react at suitable temperatures in oil bath for a desired time. After reaction, the reactor was cooled down in cold water to quench the reaction and the reaction solution was transferred and diluted by isopropanol. The samples were analyzed quantitatively by gas chromatography (GC, Shimadzu 2014) with a flame ionization detector using decane as the internal standard. Identification of the products and the reactant was fulfilled using a GC–MS (SHIMADZU-QP 2010) as well as by comparing the retention times with respective standards in GC traces.|$|R
40|$|We {{clarify the}} {{reaction}} mechanisms and kinetics in melt-reacted blends consisting of functional polysiloxanes and poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) {{with a model}} compound study. As models for polysiloxanes, we have selected two monodisperse omega-functionalized siloxane oligomers with Si-H and Si-vinyl moieties. To mimic PBT, we have chosen low molecular weight compounds representative for in-chain and end-functional groups of the polymer; ester, carboxylic acid, alcohol, and vinyl. Uncatalyzed and platinum-catalyzed reactions have been performed in <b>sealed</b> vials. <b>Reaction</b> products have been characterized by gradient polymer elution chromatography, Fourier tran form infrared spectroscopy, and size exclusion chromatography. PBT functional groups reactive toward functional siloxane oligomers at high temperatures in the presence and absence of a catalyst have been identified, and an estimate of relative reaction kinetics has been provided, We suggest reaction mechanisms compatible with our results and with literature data.

40|$|Dendron ligands {{or other}} {{branched}} ligands with cross-linkable groups were coordinated to colloidal inorganic nanoparticles, including nanocrystals, and substantially globally cross-linked through different strategies, such as ring-closing metathesis (RCM), dendrimer-bridging methods, and the like. This global cross-linking <b>reaction</b> <b>sealed</b> each nanocrystal within a dendron box to yield box-nanocrystals which showed dramatically enhanced stability against chemical, photochemical and thermal treatments {{in comparison to}} the non-cross-linked dendron-nanocrystals. Empty dendron boxes possessing a very narrow size distribution were formed by the dissolution of the inorganic nanocrystals contained therein upon acid or other etching treatments...|$|R
