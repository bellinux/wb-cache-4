5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of {{the second}} season, Fazekas {{explained}} that after Carter turned Sousa {{down at the end}} of the first season, saying [...] "Oh, let me take a rain check. I have something to do", Carter felt like a potential relationship was <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> consider, while Sousa [...] "felt like he missed an opportunity there." [...] Because of that, Sousa moved to Los Angeles to avoid Carter, and [...] "They haven’t spoken since he left. There’s that interesting awkward [...] when they start working together again. But now Sousa has got a girlfriend and it’s very serious, so that’s a new thing for Peggy to deal with." [...] Though Sousa and Carter do eventually get together in the second season finale, the executive producers warned that this did not necessarily mean Sousa is Carter's future husband, who was first mentioned in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.|$|E
500|$|Gaga further {{elaborated}} on {{the inspiration}} behind the song as walking towards the light force {{in her life}} and peering towards the devil in the back, while clutching onto {{the source of the}} light. [...] "I sing about what a holy fool I am, and that although moments in my life are so cruel and relationships can be so cruel I’m still in love with Judas. I still go back again to those evil things," [...] she said. During her interview with Google, Gaga added to the song's meaning as honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring themselves into the light. One has to learn to forgive themselves in order to move on with their life. With Popjustice she clarified that {{she has a lot of}} things that have haunted her from her past, including her choices, men, drug abuse, being afraid to go back to New York, confronting old romances. Hence [...] "Judas" [...] represented something that was not good for her, <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not escape. Gaga said: [...] "I keep going back and forth between the darkness and the light in order to understand who I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{he did not}} {{understand}} you," [...] said Marian, unable to keep from saying <b>something,</b> though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not in her agitation think of anything to the purpose.|$|R
6000|$|Dick watched Maisie's {{face and}} swelled with joy--fine, rank, vulgar triumph. She was more {{interested}} in the little crowd than in the picture. [...] That was <b>something</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> understand.|$|R
60|$|She regretted this thrust a little, for {{she felt}} it might put the man on his guard by showing that <b>she</b> {{suspected}} <b>something</b> but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not resist it, and it pleased her to see that her companion was momentarily confused.|$|R
2500|$|King was {{starting}} to think about being an artist, though this was really a second choice. But art was <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do with minimal resources, so {{long as she could}} support herself. King was influenced both by mediaeval sculpture and by Expressionist sculpture, an important part of German avant-garde art, and particularly by the work of the wood-carver, Ernst Barlach (1870–1938). The Nazis considered such art to be decadent (Entartete Kunst) and later attempted to suppress it. King went to see the artist Käthe Kollwitz (1867–1945), whose work she admired. Kollwitz’ advice to King about a career in art was “Don’t do it if you can help it. It is so difficult”. Nevertheless, King did go on. She said: “I haven’t regretted it. I agree with her, it’s difficult.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Takahashi purposefully {{aimed the}} series {{to be popular}} with women and children. In 1993, an Animerica {{interviewer}} talking with Takahashi {{asked her if she}} intended the sex-changing theme [...] "as an effort to enlighten a male-dominated society." [...] Takahashi said that she does not think in terms of societal agendas and that she created the Ranma ½ concept from simply wanting [...] "a simple, fun idea". She added that she, as a woman and while recalling what manga she liked to read as a child, felt that [...] "humans turning into animals might also be fun and ... you know, like a fairy tale." [...] In 2013, she revealed that at the start of Ranma her editor told her to make it more dramatic, but she felt that was <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not do. However, she admitted that drama did start to appear at the end. She also sat in on the voice actor auditions for the anime, where she insisted that male and female Ranma be voiced by different actors whose gender corresponded to that of the part.|$|E
2500|$|Emma {{tries to}} ignite the spark into a flame when Rumplestiltskin's manifestation appears {{and says that}} Arthur will kill her if he reunites Excalibur, {{but she says she}} has no choice and can’t risk the lives of her family. Rumple's manifestation says that she can only light it when she’s ready to give up the darkness. As the manifestation tries to goad Emma into {{lighting}} the flame, Emma loses her temper and yells at him to stop. Henry finds Emma talking to herself, and he asks what she’s doing, and what the [...] "voices" [...] said. Emma says that they told her she wasn’t ready to give up the darkness. He shows her a photo of a house that he and Hook were looking at for their Operation Light Swan, which Hook planned to obtain for Emma after she was free of the Darkness. Henry tells her that it was a reminder of <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> look forward to. Emma shuts the lid on the spark and says that she's not ready to give up the darkness just yet, because she has to use her dark magic one more time.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{while he}} spoke thus {{somewhat}} at random, {{for he was}} watching her all the while, Miriam kept her eyes fixed upon his face, as though she searched there for <b>something</b> which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> but half recall. Suddenly an inspiration entered into them and she said: ...|$|R
60|$|As she {{pondered the}} {{question}} her eyes roved toward the slope beyond {{the opening to}} the amphitheater. With a start she came to her feet, shading {{her eyes with her}} hand and peering intently at <b>something</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have sworn moved among the trees far below. No, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not be mistaken--it was the figure of a man.|$|R
60|$|Something {{had struck}} her as weird: <b>something</b> which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not then define; but she was quite {{sure that it was}} not merely the unusual chilliness of that rainy summer's day, which had caused her to tremble so, when--in the vestry--her husband had taken her hand and kissed her.|$|R
2500|$|That {{is such a}} {{difficult}} question. There are times when certain people are blessed—and cursed—with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. Callas {{was one of these}} people. It was as if her own wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us things about music that we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that is why singers admire her so. I think that's why conductors admire her so. I know it's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did it. She usually had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her [...] "It must be a very enviable thing to be Maria Callas." [...] And she said, [...] "No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand." [...] She couldn't really explain what she did. It was all done by instinct. It was something embedded deep within her.|$|E
60|$|She {{picked up}} the dead bird and paddled towards the dim figure who was evidently wrestling with <b>something,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not see what.|$|E
6000|$|Gyp took up her sunshade. She {{felt that}} she must get away; at any moment he might say <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not bear--and the smell of mutton rising fast! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{girl looked}} at Prescott; troubled and {{surprised}} by the confused emotions his face betrayed. There was obviously <b>something</b> wrong, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not imagine what it was.|$|R
60|$|She had {{a feeling}} at his {{departure}} as of an immense cavity, of <b>something</b> enormously gone; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not tell whether it was infinite regret or infinite relief....|$|R
6000|$|Mary {{felt some}} consternation. Could it depend on her? [...] <b>She</b> <b>could</b> speak naturally, {{and from her}} heart in defence of Louis when {{occasion}} served; but something within her forbade the thought of doing so on a system. Was that <b>something</b> wrong! <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not answer; but contented herself with the womanly intuition that showed her that anything of persuasion in {{the present state of}} affairs would be ineffectual and unbecoming.|$|R
60|$|Moreover, {{there was}} <b>something,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not tell exactly what, about Miss Panney's words and manner, which put an {{unsatisfactory}} aspect upon the obvious methods of Cicely's communications with her employer.|$|E
60|$|But {{she did not}} hear. She lay, {{looking at}} him as at <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never understand, never: as a child looks at a grown-up person, without hope of understanding, only submitting.|$|E
60|$|They {{discussed}} the future, or, rather, my father discussed, my mother listening in silence, stealing {{a puzzled look}} at him from time to time, as though there were <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not understand.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{standing}} before {{her with his}} head down, and a sense that, naive and bat-like as he was, there was <b>something</b> in him <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not reach or understand, made her cry out: ...|$|R
60|$|What {{she would}} resolve {{to do that}} day did not yet seem quite clear, but <b>something</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> achieve stirred her as with an {{approaching}} murmur which would soon gather distinctness. She took off the clothes which seemed {{to have some of}} the weariness of a hard watching in them, and began to make her toilet. Presently she rang for Tantripp, who came in her dressing-gown.|$|R
60|$|She had {{a capital}} time with Molly, called on Jill, did her {{shopping}} in the village, {{and had just}} turned to walk up the hill, when Ralph Evans came tramping along behind her, looking so pleased and proud about <b>something</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not help asking what it was, for they were great friends, and Merry thought that {{to be an artist}} was the most glorious career a man could choose.|$|R
60|$|Weary of solitary {{thinking}} on one subject, Francine {{returned to the}} terrace with a vague idea of finding something to amuse her--that is to say, <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> turn into ridicule--if she joined the girls.|$|E
60|$|She leaned {{a little}} {{forward on the}} couch. She looked into his face searchingly, anxiously, as if seeking for <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not find. His lips were set in hard, cold lines. The {{likeness}} to Stephen had never been more apparent.|$|E
60|$|She had {{gazed at}} the {{addressed}} envelope, smiled (I was {{looking up at her}} from my desk), and at last took it up with an effort of sanctimonious repugnance. But she remained with it in her hand looking at me as though she were piously gloating over <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> read in my face.|$|E
60|$|It is {{a natural}} impulse, in every one, when they hear a tale of distress, to think of {{something}} to say by way of consolation. Emmeline wanted to say <b>something,</b> but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not think of anything to say. What was there to be said? As by a common consent, they both avoided, with fear and dread, all mention of the horrible man who was now their master.|$|R
60|$|If she {{had felt}} impatience and regret before--if she had been sorry for what she said, and feared its too strong effect on him--she now felt and feared it all tenfold more. She had, moreover, to contend with one disagreeable emotion entirely new to her--jealousy. His friend Mr. Owen had sisters; he might find them attractive. But, at any rate, his staying away at a time when, {{according}} to all preceding plans, she was to remove to London, meant <b>something</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not bear. Had Henry returned, as he talked of doing, {{at the end of}} three or four days, she should now have been leaving Mansfield. It became absolutely necessary for her to get to Fanny and try to learn <b>something</b> more. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not live any longer in such solitary wretchedness; and she {{made her way to the}} Park, through difficulties of walking which she had deemed unconquerable a week before, for the chance of hearing a little in addition, for the sake of at least hearing his name.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] exclaimed Dorothy, {{rubbing her}} nose, which had struck <b>something</b> hard, {{although}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not see what}} it was; [...] "this isn't {{as easy as it}} looks. What has stopped us, Ozma? Is it magic of some sort?" ...|$|R
60|$|After {{that the}} fire slowly went down. He felt more and more that his {{experience}} had been impersonal, and not Clara. He loved her. There was a big tenderness, as after a strong emotion they had known together; {{but it was not}} she who could keep his soul steady. He had wanted her to be <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not be.|$|E
60|$|Surrounded by that glance, {{waiting for}} Courtier, Barbara, not less British than her neighbours, was {{secretly}} slanting her own eyes {{up and down}} over the absent figure of her new acquaintance. She too wanted <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> look up to, {{and at the same}} time see damned first. And in this knight-errant it seemed to her that she had got it.|$|E
60|$|She felt {{a terrible}} hunger, {{a desire to}} take his head {{in her arms and}} kiss it. Her muscles ached and quivered with <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not fathom. As she {{resisted}} she grew calm, but mysteriously sad, as if something were passing from her forever. The leaves whispered a message to her, and the stream repeated an occult note of joy, which was mixed with sorrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{a person}} I never think of from one month's end to another," [...] said Mr. Knightley, {{with a degree of}} vexation, which made Emma {{immediately}} talk of <b>something</b> else, though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not comprehend why he should be angry.|$|R
6000|$|... "God is not willing--you can't suppose it; what {{business}} have {{you to be}} suited so well with a partner? And she treats you {{with a sort of}} respect, too, and says, 'Monsieur' and modulates her tone in addressing you, actually, as if you were <b>something</b> superior! <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not evince more deference to such a one as I, were she favoured by fortune to the supreme extent of being my choice instead of yours." ...|$|R
60|$|La Fleur {{was in a}} quandary; {{there was}} no one at home but herself; a {{telegram}} is always important; very likely an immediate answer was required; and here was an opportunity to send one. If the message were from his sister, there might be <b>something</b> which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> answer. At any rate, it was an affair that must not be neglected, and Mr. Haverley had gone off with his fishing-rod, and no one knew when he would get back.|$|R
