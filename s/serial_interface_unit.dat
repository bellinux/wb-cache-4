40|$|Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) is an {{automated}} system which is multi-lingual and {{makes use of}} text-to-speech (TTS) technology. This paper describes the implementation of an Interactive Voice Response System personalized especially for students to obtain any information desired by them in a reliable and timely manner by just placing a normal call, thus being a building block of a smart city. It works on a 24 / 7 basis and is very user friendly. The IVRS system comprises of ring detector hardware, {{dual tone multi frequency}} decoder (DTMFD), microcontroller, <b>serial</b> <b>interface</b> <b>unit,</b> computer and cell phone. It includes a ring detector hardware which identifies the caller and connects the identified caller to a computer. When a caller presses a key from their cell phone the input is produced in the form of dual tone multi frequency signal. The computer generates voice response dynamically based on the key pressed by the caller. A ``Text to Speech Converter'' converts the database into a voice format as per the response given by the caller...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of "A multiprocessor node for communication and control" (MPCC). MPCC is a high speed, high performance local area network capable of performing real time control tasks. This is achieved by the concurrent operation of two 8051 microcontrollers, a dual port RAM and the intelligent and high performance <b>serial</b> <b>interface</b> <b>unit</b> on-board the INTEL 8344. To achieve the desired high performance in the MPCC, "the division of labor" principle was applied. A dedicated "application processor" is employed to carry out all application tasks and a "communications processor" {{to take care of}} all communication needs in the MPCC. These needs include: host to node, node to host, and node to node. The INTEL 8051 microcontroller is used as the application processor and the INTEL 8344 RUPI is used as the communications processor. To increase the frame size of the transmitted and received frames, the INTEL 8344 microcontroller is operated in the expanded node. MPCC employs the Token passing method for bus access and uses the RS- 485 multidrop implementation for the bus. Data rates as high as 300 kbs have been achieved. A monitor, debugger program, MDP- 44 was developed for the 8044. TASKMASTER [HERZ 86] was modified to receive the command packet from the dual port RAM. Software was developed to operate the SIU in expanded mode for communications...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of COLAN V, a High Performance Local Area Network for Communications and Control utilizing a Communications Coprocessor. The main objective of this thesis is to improve upon the performance of previous COLANs in speed, switching techniques and error detection techniques. This was possible due to excellent capabilities of INTEL's 8344 a microcontroller with high performance <b>serial</b> <b>interface</b> <b>unit</b> (SIU). This SIU can operate on a concurrent basis with the core CPU which is an 8051 microcontroller. Carrier Sense Multiple Access and Collision Detection technique (CSMA/CD) {{has been used by}} COLAN V for the bus access. COLAN V consists of nodes and a system bus. The system bus uses the EIA RS- 485 standard for synchronous communication. RS- 485 has a higher data rate and a lower error rate than the conventional RS- 232 -C. Each node in. COLAN V consists of an RS- 485 circuit for bus access and RS- 232 -C circuit for communication with the host. Both these circuits are installed on SIBEC II single board computer. The COLAN V software supports two interrupts. One for the host to communicate within the node and the other one is the SIU interrupt, which is for communication on the bus. Nodes in COLAN V can communicate with each other and can execute tasks for control purposes...|$|E
