The film's title was changed from Can a Song <b>Save</b> <b>Your</b> Life? to Begin Again between its festival premiere and its theatrical release because viewers {{found it difficult to}} remember and it was often misquoted.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, {{a similar}} promotional {{campaign}} was launched encouraging {{the public to}} vote on one of several possible new tokens to replace an existing one. The choices were a guitar, a diamond ring, a helicopter, a robot, and a cat. Unlike in 1998, this <b>Save</b> <b>Your</b> Token Campaign had one piece being retired, {{in this case the}} iron, and replaced by a new token, the cat. Both were chosen by a vote that ran on Facebook from January 8 to February 5, 2013 in which the cat received the top spot with 31% of the vote. Shortly after the Facebook voting campaign, a limited-edition Golden Token set was released exclusively at various national retailers, such as Target in the U.S. and Tesco in the U.K. This set contained the 2008–2013 tokens as listed above, and also contained all five of the iron's potential replacements: the cat, the guitar, the diamond ring, the helicopter, and the robot.|$|E

[...] "Between My Legs", which Wainwright wrote about a [...] "boy [...] was infatuated with named Tommy Hotpants", is a [...] "fantasy about being able to <b>save</b> <b>your</b> object of desire when the apocalypse comes, and bring him to some sort of hidden paradise." [...] The last 30 seconds of the song contains the opening notes of the title song from Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical The Phantom of the Opera, along with a dramatic spoken word part by Siân Phillips.

500|$|Director John Carney {{conceived}} the premise for Begin Again {{several years before}} he began to write the screenplay in 2010. The story was partly inspired by his own experiences as a musician in a band, and from his impression of the artists and repertoire (A) executives of record labels during the 1990s, which {{formed the basis of}} Dan's character. Carney wrote the script, which was initially titled Can a Song <b>Save</b> <b>Your</b> Life?, before he, Glen Hansard, and Gregg Alexander began writing the songs; he wanted [...] "to work the music around the story, instead of the other way around." [...] The script's style of featuring songs as a natural element of the story was inspired by the 1954 Judy Garland musical film A Star Is Born, and is also employed in Carney's earlier film Once (2007). Carney first pitched the film in 2010 to filmmaker Judd Apatow, who produced the film alongside Tobin Armbrust and Anthony Bregman whose production company Exclusive Media financed the film's US$8 million budget.|$|E
