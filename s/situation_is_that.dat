5|$|The {{captaincy}} {{was given}} to Vic Richardson, Bradman's predecessor as South Australian captain. Cricket author Chris Harte's analysis of the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a prior (unspecified) commercial agreement forced Bradman to remain in Australia. Harte attributed an ulterior motive to his relocation: the off-field behaviour of Richardson and other South Australian players had displeased the South Australia Cricket Association (SACA), which was looking for new leadership. To help improve discipline, Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA, and a selector of the South Australian and Australian teams. He took his adopted state to its first Sheffield Shield title for 10years, Bradman weighing in with personal contributions of 233 against Queensland and 357 against Victoria. He finished the season with 369 (in 233minutes), a South Australian record, made against Tasmania. The bowler who dismissed him, Reginald Townley, would later become leader of the Tasmanian Liberal Party.|$|E

In the teaching community, a considerable debate has existed for over half a century on how to define weight for their students.

25|$|The art {{began to}} be taught in the West somewhere along the 1960s-1970s. However, it only rose to {{prominence}} among martial arts communities worldwide during {{the first decade of}} the 21st century. Currently, it is still not well known among the general public. One explanation for this <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> unlike other traditional oriental martial arts, Xing Yi was not a notable style in movies which became popular in the West (and though a modified 'wushu' version of it appeared in The One, starring Jet Li, this was not told or hinted to the viewers as part of that film's script).|$|E

25|$|Chris Harte has {{thoroughly}} {{researched the}} files of the SACA, and written histories of both the SACA and Australian cricket. His analysis of the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> an (unspecified) prior commercial agreement forced Bradman to remain in Australia. Moreover, Harte attributes an ulterior motive to the SACA's recruitment of Bradman. The issue of the off-field behaviour of Vic Richardson, and some other regular SA players, had festered {{over a number of}} years and the SACA was desperate for a solution. Therefore, they wanted Bradman to provide new leadership and improve discipline, as well as score runs. Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA, and a selector of the SA and Australian teams. He took his adopted state to the Sheffield Shield for the first time in ten years and set a string of SA records along the way.|$|E
25|$|Raw {{effluent}} {{from the}} entire town still travels through the drainage system built in the 1930s, and spews out into the River Avoca untreated via several sewage outfall pipes along the river between the bypass bridge and the Nineteen Arches bridge, {{on both sides of}} the river. The proposed sewage treatment plant was first awarded planning permission in 1993. This was challenged unsuccessfully to An Bord Pleanála, however subsequently no funding arrived from government, and the planning permission was allowed to lapse. A further ten-year planning permission was granted in 1999. Since then it too has been challenged unsuccessfully to An Bord Pleanála. The current <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> yet another legal challenge has been mounted by the objectors to the plant. Meanwhile, raw human effluence continues to flow untreated into the River Avoca. The Arklow Sea Scout group has started an online petition in favour of the proposed plant.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Tran of {{the website}} Overmental, {{on the other}} hand, reacted more {{positively}} to the episode. He felt that both King Huge and Seven were representative of a stagnation in mindset; according to him, they are both stuck in their ways and unwilling to change. However, {{he notes that the}} two also differ substantially. Tran argues that King Huge has legions of slaves feeding him the richest of foods. He is comfortable, but unaccustomed to dealing with outsiders, which expresses itself as xenophobia. Seven, on the other hand, lives in abject poverty, and is much more welcoming of strangers. In the end, Seven escapes the episode unscathed, and according to Tran, the moral of the episode is that [...] "the bright side of a crap <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] pushes rather than restricts, enriches rather than fattens." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1974, writer Peter Benchley {{published}} Jaws, a {{novel about}} a rogue great white shark that terrorizes the fictional coastal community of Amity Island. Chief of police Martin Brody, biologist Matt Hooper, and fisherman Quint hunt the shark after it kills four people. The novel was adapted as the film Jaws by Steven Spielberg in 1975. Spielberg's film makes reference {{to the events of}} 1916: Brody (Roy Scheider) and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) urge Amity's Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) to close the beaches on the Fourth of July after the deaths of two swimmers and a fisherman. Hooper explains to the mayor, [...] "Look, the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> apparently a great white shark has staked a claim in the waters off Amity Island. And he's going to continue to feed here {{as long as there is}} food in the water." [...] Brody adds, [...] "And there's no limit to what he's gonna do! I mean we've already had three incidents, two people killed inside of a week. And it's gonna happen again, it happened before! The Jersey beach!... 1916! Five people chewed up on the surf!" [...] Richard Ellis, Richard Fernicola, and Michael Capuzzo suggest that the 1916 Jersey Shore attacks, Coppleson's rogue shark theory, and the exploits of New York fisherman Frank Mundus inspired Benchley. While Benchley states Mundus was an inspiration for Quint, he has denied the book was inspired by attacks off New Jersey in 1916. [...] The attacks are also briefly referred to in Benchley's novel White Shark (1994).|$|E
2500|$|Drezet {{argues that}} the {{classical}} concept of a [...] "path" [...] leads to much confusion in this context, but [...] "The real problem in Afshar's interpretation {{comes from the fact}} that the interference pattern is not actually completely recorded." [...] The argument is similar to that of Motl's, that the observed visibility of the fringes is actually very small. Another way he looks at the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the photons used to measure the fringes are not the same photons that are used to measure the path. The experimental setup he analyzes is only a [...] "slightly modified version" [...] of the one used by Afshar.|$|E
2500|$|According to Sister Mary Johnson, Sister Patricia Wittberg, and Mary Gautier, in New {{generations of}} Catholic Sisters:Some commentators, for ideological purposes, {{attempt to create}} {{generalized}} typologies that mask {{the complexity of the}} religious reality, arguing that all new entrants go to traditionalist (CMSWR [...] ) institutes and few or none go to LCWR [...] institutes. … The reality of the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> almost an equal percentage of LCWR and CMSWR institutes have no one at all in formation at the present time (32 percent and 27 percent, respectively). One of the most striking findings regarding new entrants is that almost equal numbers of women have been attracted to institutes in both conferences in recent years.|$|E

2500|$|Likewise, in {{agreement}} with Ottolenghi, the journalist Dan Rickman said that [...] "Shahak ignores [...] aspects of the sources. Further, through overstating his case, his analysis fits into anti-Semitic traditions of such accusations against the Talmud. Copies of the Talmud have been burned, and {{the text of the}} Talmud that is studied today is still heavily censored. Shahak's view that chauvinism in these sources in any way 'justifies' anti-Semitism is also very troubling. However, I do believe that his trenchant critique of Judaism is, tragically, not without some force. The contemporary <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we do see some modern Orthodox rabbis utilise xenophobic sources in modern rulings. Orthodox rabbis in organisations such as Rabbis for Human Rights are sadly {{the exception rather than the}} rule".|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "last stand" [...] is a {{last resort}} tactic, and is chosen because the {{defending}} force realizes or believes the benefits of fighting outweigh the benefits of retreat or surrender. This usually arises from strategic or moral considerations, such as staying and fighting to buy time for wounded soldiers or civilians {{to get to a}} safe place, leading defenders to conclude that their sacrifice is essential to the greater success of their campaign or cause, as happened {{at the end of the}} Battle of Thermopylae. The situation can arise in several ways. One <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> retreat by the defending force would lead to immediate defeat, usually due to the surrounding geography or shortage of supplies or support, as happened to the Royalist infantry on Wadborough Hill after the Battle of Naseby.|$|E

2500|$|General {{interpretation}} {{about the}} freedom of religion {{as described in the}} constitution in Malaysia is that a person has a right to practice his or her religion freely. This freedom does not grant a person a right to change his or her religion [...] "at a whim and fancy". For example, a Muslim who wants to convert to another religion must get an explicit permission from a syariah court. The syariah courts rarely grant such requests, except in cases where a person has actually lived his or her whole adult life as a person of different religion, and only wants to change the official documents to reflect this fact. The Islamic interpretation of the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> only the syariah courts can decide who is a Muslim and who is not. A person does not have such freedom, and so cannot have a say in the judgement given in a syariah court.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the War in Iraq, Buckley stated, [...] "The {{reality of}} the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{missions}} abroad to effect regime change in countries without {{a bill of rights}} or democratic tradition are terribly arduous."

But it is absolutely to say that conservatism implies a certain submission to reality; and this war has an unrealistic frank and is being conscripted by events." [...] In a February 2006 column published at National Review Online and distributed by Universal Press Syndicate, Buckley stated unequivocally that, [...] "One cannot doubt that the American objective in Iraq has failed." [...] Buckley has also stated that [...] "...it's important that we acknowledge in the inner councils of state that it (the war) has failed, so that we should look for opportunities to cope with that failure." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{histories}} of the Collingwood Football Club suggest that Jock McHale was that club's first coach, appointed in 1914. Until 2015, McHale took {{his place in the}} record books as the VFL's longest serving coach, coaching 714 games (he retired in 1949) and he {{is also one of the}} most successful, helping Collingwood to eight Premierships. [...] However, other histories indicate that McHale was actually Collingwood's fifth coach. [...] The actual <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> McHale was the first person to be given the official title of Coach. [...] This was after he retired as a player at the end of the 1913 season. [...] However he had actually been the captain-coach for two seasons prior to his official appointment (and his total of coaching 714 games does take the 1912 and 1913 seasons into account). [...] Between 1905 and 1911, Dick Condon, Edward [...] "Ted" [...] Rowell and George Angus had also taken on the coaching role as well as being captains. [...] Interestingly, in 1904, retired player Bill Strickland was Collingwood's non-playing coach in everything but name.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{contact between}} the two {{cultures}} is proved by the dispersion of the sweet potato: this staple of the pre-contact Polynesian diet is of South American origin, {{and there is no}} evidence that its seed could spread by floating across the ocean. Either Polynesians traveled to South America and back, or South American balsa rafts drifted to Polynesia, possibly unable to make a return trip because of their less developed navigational skills and more fragile boats. Polynesian connections in South America have been claimed to exist among the Mapuches in central and southern Chile. The Polynesian name for the small islet of Sala y Gómez (Manu Motu Motiro Hiva, [...] "Bird's islet on the way to a far away land") east of [...] Easter Island has also been seen as a hint that South America was known before European contacts. Further complicating the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the word Hiva ("far away land") was also the name of the islanders' legendary home country. Inexplicable insistence on an eastern origin for the first inhabitants was unanimous among the islanders in all early accounts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{result is}} a syllabary of 2082 syllables, about 80% of which are single morphemes—that is, in 80% of cases there is no {{difference}} between GC and standard written Chinese, and in running text, that figure rises to 90–95%, as the most common morphemes tend to be uniquely identified. For example, kai can only mean 開 kāi 'open', and sam can only mean 三 sān 'three'. Chao notes, [...] "These syllables then are morphemes, or words with definite meanings, or clusters of meanings related by extensions. About 20 percent of the syllables are homophones under each of which there will be more than one morpheme, [...] usually written with different characters [...] The degree of homophony is so low that {{it will be possible to}} write text either in literary or colloquial Chinese with the same character for each syllable [...] as has been tested in texts of various styles." [...] Chao compares General Chinese to how Chinese was written when the writing system was still productive: [...] "This amounts to a 100 percent use of writing Chinese by 'phonetic loan' [...] The <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when the ancients wrote a character by sound regardless of meaning, it was a 'loan character', whereas if a modern schoolboy writes one, he is punished for writing the wrong character!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Following ALFs conclusion, Clausen was {{unemployed}} {{for seven}} months. Clausen's friend suggested {{him to a}} producer from the Fox animated series The Simpsons who {{were looking for a}} new composer. Clausen [...] "had no interest in doing animation" [...] and [...] "wanted to be a drama composer." [...] However, the show's creator Matt Groening told him [...] "we don't look upon this as being a cartoon but a drama where the characters are drawn, and we would like it scored that way." [...] Clausen took the job. Groening told Clausen that the [...] "emotion [...] scored first and the action scored second", unlike many other cartoons, and that [...] "scoring the emotions of the characters" [...] was the primary aim for The Simpsons. Clausen's first episode was [...] "Treehouse of Horror", the third episode of season two, in 1990. It served as an audition and he was hired permanently after that. He has since scored almost all of the music and songs which have appeared on the show, across a wide range of musical styles {{through the end of the}} 28th season. He conducted a 35 piece orchestra for the music, a rarity for television shows, and recorded the score for an episode every week. Clausen wrote an episode's score during the week, recorded it on a Friday, with some variation if vocals are required. The limited timeframe proved the most challenging aspect of the job for Clausen; he was once required to write 57musical cues in one week. For the show's original songs production is much longer; Clausen records the music to the writers' lyrics, over seven or eight months the scene is animated, and then Clausen can re-record the song with a full orchestra. The full orchestra allows easy transition between the wide range of musical styles required for the show. Clausen noted: [...] "The greatest composing challenge has been to try to make some kind of musical sense out of the cues when I have only a few seconds to make a musical statement. We have a joke on the scoring stage that I can make you feel five ways in thirteen seconds. We say it in jest, but the reality of the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I am required to do just that quite often." [...] Clausen intentionally opted against composing themes for each character, with some exceptions such as Mr. Burns, and instead [...] " [...] each story its own theme and thematic development...That approach helps to give each story its own special identification, more like individual mini-movies." [...] He supplements the orchestra with additional instruments, such as extra brass for the episode [...] "Cape Feare", for which Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which continued to be played whenever Bob gets out of prison in subsequent episodes. It is based on the score of the movie Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical requests of the writers range from rerecord a specific piece of music to compose something based on this character's emotion in a scene.|$|E
