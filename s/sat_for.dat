5|$|Scotland {{was allowed}} to elect sixteen {{representative}} peers, while Ireland could elect twenty-eight. Those chosen by Scotland <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> a single term, and following each dissolution new Scottish peers were elected. In contrast, Irish representative peers <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> life. Elections for Irish peers ceased when the Irish Free State came into existence as a Dominion in December 1922. However, already-elected Irish peers continued {{to be entitled to}} sit until their death. Elections for Scottish peers ended in 1963, when all Scottish peers obtained the right to sit in the House of Lords.|$|E

His wife Philippa, Lady Scott, <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> Jon Edgar as part of his Environmental Series of heads, and a bronze was unveiled in the visitor centre in December 2011. A sculpture of Peter Scott's mother by Kathleen Scott is also on display in the grounds.|$|E

5|$|During the English Civil War Manchester {{strongly}} favoured the Parliamentary interest. Although not long-lasting, Cromwell granted it {{the right}} to elect its own MP. Charles Worsley, who <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> the city for only a year, was later appointed Major General for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire during the Rule of the Major Generals. He was a diligent puritan, turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of Christmas; he died in 1656.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} has had 54 different members. Thirteen {{people have been}} chair and six deputy chair. Ten women have sat on the committee, starting with Aase Lionæs in 1949. From 2009, four of the board's five members are women. Christian Lous Lange {{is the only person}} to have both sat on the committee and been its secretary, and the only peace laureate to have sat on the committee. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson was, however, awarded the Nobel Literature Prize. The longest-serving members are Hans Jacob Horst and Aase Lionæs, who both served for 30 years. The longest-sitting chair is Gunnar Jahn, who <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> 26 years as chair and 29 years on the committee. The longest period without any changes to the committee was the 15 years from 1949 to 1963. The shortest-sitting member was Esther Kostøl, who <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> less than a year in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Dress {{rehearsal}} for the sketch went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was having difficulty correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T. Kirk as originally portrayed by actor William Shatner. Belushi had <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> several hours while being made up {{so that he would}} look the part. Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over well with the audience. He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi {{would not be able to}} pull off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E
50|$|In October 2008, Balls {{announced}} that the Government had decided to scrap <b>SATs</b> tests <b>for</b> 14-year-olds, a move which was broadly welcomed by teachers, parent groups and opposition MPs. The decision to continue with <b>SATs</b> tests <b>for</b> 11-year-olds was described by head teachers' leader Mick Brookes as a missed opportunity.|$|R

He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to Australia, Robertson became brigade major in the 7th Light Horse Brigade.

In April 1922 he <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> and passed the entrance examination to the Staff College, Camberley, where his class included Majors Arthur Percival, John Smyth and Georges Vanier, and Lieutenant Colonel Harry Crerar. Robertson eventually became the first Australian to graduate with an A-grade pass.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} was created with the ministry on 22 February 1946, when Nils Langhelle (Labour) was appointed. The ministry and minister position were split {{out from the}} Ministry of Labour. Twenty-eight people have held the position, representing six parties. Sixteen people have represented the Labour Party, five the Centre Party, two each the Christian Democratic Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party {{and one for the}} Progress Party. The longest-sitting minister is Kjell Opseth (Labour) who sat a week short of six years. Lars Leiro (Centre) <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> only four weeks, giving him the shortest tenure.

5|$|The {{temporary}} government <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> {{the first}} time in 1872. It was renewed by federal legislation each year until a permanent solution for governance was decided upon. The federal government renewed the Temporary Council for the last time in 1875 and chose a new location, within the boundaries of the Northwest Territories, to form a new government. Along with the new seat of power, a new council greatly reduced in size was appointed along with a new Lieutenant Governor to specifically lead the Territories without also governing Manitoba.|$|E
5|$|Although Max insisted von Neumann {{attend school}} at the grade level {{appropriate}} to his age, he agreed to hire private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas {{in which he had}} displayed an aptitude. At the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst Gábor Szegő. On their first meeting, Szegő was so astounded with the boy's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears. Some of von Neumann's instant solutions to the problems in calculus posed by Szegő, sketched out on his father's stationery, are still on display at the von Neumann archive in Budapest. By the age of 19, von Neumann had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, which superseded Georg Cantor's definition. At the conclusion of his education at the gymnasium, von Neumann <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> and won the Eötvös Prize, a national prize for mathematics.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{to carve}} a career for herself outside teaching, in 1910 Wilkinson <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> {{and won the}} Jones Open History Scholarship, which gave her a place at Manchester University. There, she found many {{opportunities}} to extend her political activities. She joined the university's branch of the Fabian Society, and eventually became its joint secretary. She continued her suffragist work by joining the Manchester Society for Women's Suffrage, where she impressed Margaret Ashton, the first woman member of Manchester City Council, by her efforts in the North Manchester and Gorton constituencies. Through these and other campaigning activities Wilkinson met many of the contemporary leaders of the radical left—the veteran campaigner Charlotte Despard, the ILP leader William Crawford Anderson, and Beatrice and Sidney Webb among others. She also came {{under the influence of}} Walton Newbold, an older student who later became the United Kingdom's first Communist MP. The two were briefly engaged, and although this was soon broken off, they remained close political associates for many years.|$|E

5|$|Now out of favour {{and with}} no chance of {{returning}} to the judiciary, Coke was re-elected to Parliament as an MP, ironically by order of the King, who expected Coke to support his efforts. Elected in 1620, Coke <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> Liskeard in the 1621 Parliament, which was called by the King to raise revenues; other topics of discussion included a proposed marriage between the Prince of Wales and Maria Anna of Spain, and possible military support for the King's son-in-law, Frederick V, Elector Palatine. Coke became a leading opposition MP, along with Robert Phelips, Thomas Wentworth and John Pym, campaigning against any military intervention and the marriage of the Prince of Wales and Maria Anna. His position {{at the head of}} the opposition was unsurprising given his extensive experience in both local and central government, as well as his ability to speak with authority on matters of economics, parliamentary procedure and the law. He subsequently sat as MP for Coventry (1624), Norfolk (1625) and Buckinghamshire (1628).|$|E
5|$|Partly {{inspired}} by {{his visit to the}} Spanish court in 1623, Charles became a passionate and knowledgeable art collector, amassing one of the finest art collections ever assembled. In Spain, he <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> a sketch by Velázquez, and acquired works by Titian and Correggio, among others. In England, his commissions included the ceiling of the Banqueting House, Whitehall, by Rubens and paintings by other artists from the Low Countries such as van Honthorst, Mytens, and van Dyck. His close associates, including the Duke of Buckingham and the Earl of Arundel, shared his interest and have been dubbed the Whitehall Group. In 1627 and 1628, Charles purchased the entire collection of the Duke of Mantua, which included work by Titian, Correggio, Raphael, Caravaggio, del Sarto and Mantegna. His collection grew further to encompass Bernini, Bruegel, da Vinci, Holbein, Hollar, Tintoretto and Veronese, and self-portraits by both Dürer and Rembrandt. By Charles's death, there were an estimated 1760 paintings, most of which were sold and dispersed by Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Pitt Chin Hui (1906—1981) {{was born}} to a wealthy family in Guangzhou, China. She was the {{youngest}} child of the family, and was taken by her mother to Penang to receive her early education. In 1924, she <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> the Senior Cambridge Examination, and {{while waiting for the}} examination results she became an English teacher at the Fujian Girls' School. In 1927, she left for further studies at the Zhongshan University in Guangzhou. However, she terminated her tertiary studies and returned to Penang when her mother became seriously ill. While in Penang, she attended Dharma lectures by Venerable Taixu and his disciple, Venerable Cihang, at the Kek Lok Si Temple. Pitt subsequently became one of Cihang's disciples, and studied under him. She was responsible for setting up the Maha Bodhi School in Penang and Singapore (1946), to promote Buddhist education to the young. Along with her school duties, Pitt was also an active voluntary worker in the Buddhist community.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} the problem of the {{existence}} of a p-optimal proof system <b>for</b> <b>SAT</b> can be characterized in a similar manner as J. Hartmanis and L. Hemachandra characterized the problem of the existence of complete languages for UP. Namely, there exists a p-optimal proof system <b>for</b> <b>SAT</b> if and only if there is a suitable recursive presentation of the class of all easy (polynomial time recognizable) subsets of SAT. Using this characterization we prove that if there does not exist a p-optimal proof system <b>for</b> <b>SAT,</b> then <b>for</b> every theory T there exists an easy subset of SAT which is not T-provably easy...|$|R

5|$|Since {{there were}} few posts in Hungary for mathematicians, and those were not well-paid, his father wanted von Neumann to follow him into {{industry}} and thereby invest his time in a more financially useful endeavor than mathematics. Von Neumann and his father decided that the best career path {{was to become a}} chemical engineer. This was not something that von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year non-degree course in chemistry at the University of Berlin, after which he <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> the entrance exam to the prestigious ETH Zurich, which he passed in September 1923. At the same time, von Neumann also entered Pázmány Péter University in Budapest, as a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics. For his thesis, he chose to produce an axiomatization of Cantor's set theory. He passed his final examinations for his Ph.D. soon after graduating from ETH Zurich in 1926. He then went to the University of Göttingen on a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study mathematics under David Hilbert.|$|E
5|$|He and {{his brother}} Jonathan were sent to Le Mans Military Academy in Rolling Prairie, Indiana, after Jackson was {{diagnosed}} as hyperactive. He was often paddled for disciplinary reasons during his time as a cadet. Jackson repeated ninth grade and was suspended from school twice. He was an all-state running back on his football team {{in high school and}} was featured in the February 1984 issue of Sports Illustrated as part of their Faces in the Crowd section, which noted him for his 15touchdowns, 889rushing yards, and 7.2yards per carry in six games. Jackson enrolled in North Carolina A University, his father's alma mater, earning his Bachelor of Science degree magna cum laude in 1987. He decided to follow his father's advice to receive a seminary education at the Chicago Theological Seminary, where he earned his master's degree a year early but opted not to become ordained. Jackson proceeded to law school at the University of Illinois and convinced his future wife to transfer there from the Georgetown University Law Center. He then earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Illinois College of Law in 1993. Jackson never <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> the bar exam despite finishing his coursework a semester early.|$|E
5|$|Kruger's second volksraad <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> {{the first}} time in 1891. Any {{resolution}} it passed had to be ratified by the first volksraad; its role was in effect largely advisory. Uitlanders could vote in elections for the second volksraad after two years' residency on the condition they were naturalised as burghers—a process requiring the renunciation of any foreign allegiance. The residency qualification for naturalised burghers to join the first volksraad electorate was raised from five to 14 years, with the added criterion that they had to be at least 40 years old. During the close-run campaign for the 1893 election, in which Kruger was again challenged by Joubert with the Chief Justice John Gilbert Kotzé as a third candidate, the President indicated that he was prepared to lower the 14-year residency requirement so long as it would not risk the subversion of the state's independence. The electoral result was announced as 7,854 votes for Kruger, 7,009 for Joubert, and 81 for Kotzé. Joubert's supporters alleged procedural irregularities and demanded a recount; the ballots were counted twice more and although the results varied slightly each time, every count gave Kruger a majority. Joubert conceded and Kruger was inaugurated for the third time on 12 May 1893.|$|E
