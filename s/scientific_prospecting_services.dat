40|$|The <b>scientific</b> <b>prospects</b> of {{detecting}} neutrinos with an energy close or even {{higher than the}} GKZ cut-off energy has been discussed extensively in literature. It is clear that due to their expected low flux, the detection of these ultra-high energy neutrinos (Ev > 1018 eV) requires a telescope larger than 100 km 3. Acoustic detection may provide a way to observe these ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos, as sound that they induce in the deep sea when neutrinos lose their energy travels undisturbed for many kilometers. To realize a large scale acoustic neutrino telescope, dedicated technology must be developed that allows for a deep sea sensor network. Fiber optic hydrophone technology provides a promising means to establish a large scale sensor network [1] with the proper sensitivity to detect the small signals from the neutrino interactions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{electrodynamic}} tethers {{on board}} satellites is a promising <b>scientific</b> <b>prospect.</b> While the theory describing such systems {{has been studied}} by numerous scientists and mathematicians, practical testing of these systems has been relatively unsuccessful and test data concerning the topic is limited. Low-cost CubeSats offer a cheap platform from which practical tests can be done which would contribute to advancements in the field. The design of an attitude determination and control system for such a CubeSat tether mission is discussed in this paper. This includes {{the design of a}} sensor capable of measuring the orientation of the tethered CubeSat pair using a CMOS imager. Further, the study includes the design of an active deployment system, mathematical modelling of the system, formulation of control-algorithms for controlling the tether orientation, and full orbital simulations of the system. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUltrahigh-energy {{cosmic rays}} (UHECRs), whose origin is still mysterious, provide a uniqueprobe {{of the most}} extreme environments in the universe, of the intergalactic space and of {{particle}} physicsbeyond the reach of terrestrial accelerators. The Pierre Auger Observatory started operating more than adecade ago. Outperforming preceding experiments both in size and in precision, it has boosted forward thefield of UHECRs as witnessed by a wealth of results. These include {{the study of the}} energy spectrum beyond 1 EeV with its spectral suppression around 40 EeV, of the large-scale anisotropy, of the mass composition,as well as stringent limits on photon and neutrino fluxes. But any harvest of new results also calls for new questions: what is {{the true nature of the}} spectral suppression:a propagation effect (so-called Greisen, Zatsepin and Kuz’min or GZK cutoff) or cosmic accelerators runningout of steam?

40|$|The time-variable {{electromagnetic}} sky {{has been}} well-explored at {{a wide range}} of wavelengths. In contrast, the ultra-violet (UV) variable sky is relatively poorly explored, even though it offers exciting <b>scientific</b> <b>prospects.</b> Here, we review the potential scientific impact of a wide-field UV survey on the study of explosive and other transient events, as well as known classes of variable objects, such as active galactic nuclei and variable stars. We quantify our predictions using a fiducial set of observational parameters which are similar to those envisaged for the proposed ULTRASAT mission. We show that such a mission would be able to revolutionize our knowledge about massive star explosions by measuring the early UV emission from hundreds of events, revealing key physical parameters of the exploding progenitor stars. Such a mission would also detect the UV emission from many tens of tidal-disruption events of stars by supermassive black holes at galactic nuclei and enable a measurement of the rate of such events. The overlap of such a wide-field UV mission with existing and planned gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino telescopes makes it especially timely...|$|R

However, after the dynamo experiments in Karlsruhe and Riga, the von-Karman-Sodium (VKS) dynamo is only the third facility that {{has been able to}} demonstrate fluid flow driven self-generation of magnetic fields in a laboratory experiment. Further progress in the experimental examination of dynamo action is expected from the planned precession driven dynamo experiment that will be designed in the framework of the liquid sodium facility DRESDYN (DREsden Sodium facility for DYNamo and thermohydraulic studies). In this paper, we briefly present numerical models of the VKS dynamo that demonstrate the close relation between the axisymmetric field observed in that experiment and the soft iron material used for the flow driving impellers.
