40|$|Efficient {{and robust}} {{numerical}} methods for solving the periodic Riccati differential equation (PRDE) are addressed. Such methods are essential, for example, when deriv-ing feedback controllers for orbital stabilization of underactuated mechanical systems. Two recently proposed methods for solving the PRDE are presented and evaluated on artificial systems and on two stabilization problems originating from mechanical sys-tems with unstable dynamics. The first method {{is of the}} type multiple shooting and relies on computing the stable invariant subspace of an associated Hamiltonian system. The <b>stable</b> <b>subspace</b> is determined using algorithms for computing a reordered periodic real Schur form of a cyclic matrix sequence, and a recently proposed method which implicitly constructs a <b>stable</b> <b>subspace</b> from an associated lifted pencil. The second method reformulates the PRDE as a maximization problem where the stabilizing so-lution is approximated with finite dimensional trigonometric base functions. By doing this reformulation the problem turns into a semidefinite programming problem with linear matrix inequality constraints.

40|$|Currently, passive robots are {{designed}} following a {{trial and error}} {{process in which the}} existence of a stable walking cycle for a given passive robot’s model is analyzed using Poincaré maps. The standard stability analysis procedure suffers from discretization aliasing, and it is not able to deal with complex passive models. In this paper a methodology that allows finding conditions on the robot’s parameters of a given passive model in order to obtain a stable walking cycle is proposed. The proposed methodology overcomes the aliasing problem that arises when Poincaré sections are discretized. Basically, it implements a search process that allows finding <b>stable</b> <b>subspaces</b> in the parameters’ space (i. e., regions with parameters’ combinations that produce stable walking cycles), by simulating the robot dynamics for different parameters’ combinations. After initial conditions are randomly selected, the robot’s dynamics is modeled step by step, and in the Poincaré section the existence of a walking cycle is verified. The methodology includes the definition of a search algorithm for exploring the parameters’ space, a method for the partition of the space in hypercubes and their efficient management using proper data structures, and the use of so-called design value functions that quantify the feasibility of the resulting parameters. Among the main characteristics of the proposed methodology are being robot independent (it can be used with any passive robot model, regardless of its complexity), and robust (<b>stable</b> <b>subspaces</b> incorporate a stability margin value that deals with differences between the robot’s model and its physical realization). The methodology is validated in the design process of a complex semi-passive robot that includes trunk, knees, and non-punctual feet. The robot also considers the use of actuators, controllers and batteries for its actuation.

40|$|We {{prove that}} the <b>stable</b> and {{unstable}} <b>subspaces</b> of linear cocycles of an ergodic map are invariant under topological conjugacies, hence hyperbolicity is topologically invariant. 1 Introduction It {{is well known that}} the <b>stable</b> and unstable <b>subspaces</b> of deterministic linear dynamical systems are invariant under topological conjugacies of linear systems. This follows from the topological characterization of those subspaces as the sets of points which go to the origin under the action of the system as the time tends to Σ 1, while the trajectories of points on the center subspace remain bounded away from the origin. Note that the latter fact follows from the theory of Jordan normal forms of matrices. Natural question to ask: Are the <b>stable</b> and unstable <b>subspaces</b> of linear cocycles of an ergodic map invariant under topological conjugacies analogously to the deterministic case, or can the randomness make them non-invariant?

40|$|We propose an {{effective}} subspace selection scheme as a post-processing step to improve results obtained by sparse subspace clustering (SSC). Our method starts by the computation of <b>stable</b> <b>subspaces</b> using a novel random sampling scheme. Thus constructed preliminary subspaces {{are used to}} identify the initially incorrectly clustered data points and then to reassign them to more suitable clusters based on their goodness-of-fit to the preliminary model. To improve the robustness of the algorithm, we use a dominant nearest subspace classification scheme that controls the level of sensitivity against reassignment. We demonstrate that our algorithm is convergent and superior to the direct application of a generic alternative such as principal component analysis. On several popular datasets for motion segmentation and face clustering pervasively used in the sparse subspace clustering literature the proposed method is shown to reduce greatly the incidence of clustering errors while introducing negligible disturbance to the data points already correctly clustered.
