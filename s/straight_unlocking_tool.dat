40|$|We {{present the}} basic {{exploration}} {{of a novel}} path integral formulation for models of biological neuronal networks that allows to keep the neuron model unspecified until quantities are explicitly calculated. This is done at {{the example of a}} binary neuron network containing an assembly, which is suited to discuss the limits of standard mean field theory and the feasibility of a path integral approach, while also being of some neuroscientific interest. Advanced theoretical approaches to the description of neuronal network activity are still in their infancy, but much needed, due to its nonlinearities, statistical nature, and nonequilibrium dynamics. There is thus now renewed interest in the transfer of mathematical tools developed in statistical physics to the theory of neural networks. We model a Hebbian cell assembly as a group of O(100) excitatory binary neurons with increased coupling embedded in a larger balanced random network. Using standard mean-field theory and simulation, the system properties and parameter dependencies are analysed, especially emergence of the high activity state, spontaneous transitions, and pairwise correlations. We then introduce the path integral formulation, applying it to a single population of binary neurons. We show the relation of the tree level approximation to mean field theory, calculate propagators and a 1 -loop diagram, and generalize to multiple populations. The formulation specifically uses generic properties of neuronal networks, which allows the formal description of the systems properties before an effective neuron model is fixed. It is analytically feasible for rate, binary and, possibly, spiking neurons. The implications of the results for the assembly model and the relation of our formulation to other path integral approaches are discussed. We stress that a functional form <b>unlocks</b> <b>tools</b> to treat critical phenomena, large fluctuations, disorder and may lead eventually to effective coarse grained theories by using renormalization group methods...|$|R

Later ranks require more effort, time, and skill from the player as the extremely high amount of points can usually be attained only through awards (which may give up to 2000 points apiece). The final three ranks of the game are only given to a certain number of players at a time, with Major General given to 50 players, Lieutenant General given to 25 players, and the highest rank, Supreme Commander, given to only one player at a time. These top three are brevet ranks; players retain those ranks until other players surpass them.|$|R

The SNPs that are hidden in sequence databases can be <b>unlocked</b> using bioinformatic <b>tools.</b> For efficient application of these SNPs, the sequence set should be error-free as much as possible, targeting single loci and suitable for the SNP scoring platform of choice. We have developed a pipeline to effectively mine SNPs from public EST databases with or without quality information using QualitySNP software, select reliable SNP and prepare the loci for analysis on the Illumina GoldenGate genotyping platform. The applicability of the pipeline was demonstrated using publicly available potato EST data, genotyping individuals from two diploid mapping populations and subsequently mapping the SNP markers (putative genes) in both populations. Over 7000 reliable SNPs were identified that met the criteria for genotyping on the GoldenGate platform. Of the 384 SNPs on the SNP array approximately 12 % dropped out. For the two potato mapping populations 165 and 185 SNPs segregating SNP loci could be mapped on the respective genetic maps, illustrating the effectiveness of our pipeline for SNP selection and validation.

(some col.) Unraveling the nanoscale processes of biological pathways via the testing, replication, and visualization {{of the underlying}} mechanisms remains a persistent challenge {{in the study of}} these critical life-governing systems. Recent advances in the field of chemically induced dimerization have <b>unlocked</b> multiple <b>tools</b> for the exploration of these facets of biology, including the development of switchable signaling systems, assertion of control over protein localization in the cell, and regulation of gene expression. An additional revelation through protein complexation by chemical induction is the construction of multivalent protein-based nanostructures, capable of bearing multiple targeting agents. However, stochastic assembly of these proteins has proven unsatisfactory in generating homogeneous populations. Herein, we have taken the initial steps toward developing a protein-based biomolecular language for nanostructural assembly. Through gel filtration analysis, we have characterized the ability of interfacial point mutations to modulate the stability of a bis-methotrexate (bis-MTX) induced E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) dimer over a dynamic range of 1. 5 kcal/mol. Furthermore, we have employed single-molecule fluorescence assays to demonstrate the stabilization of a heterodimeric DHFR dimer, yielding 4 -fold selectivity for the heterodimer over either corresponding homodimer. In addition to our experimental characterization of the chemically induced DHFR dimer, we have also taken steps toward the construction of a tripartite computational model of dimerization in an effort to predict the effects of further mutations. We have tested a number of molecular mechanics force fields against quantum mechanical benchmarks and discovered that the MMFF 94, OPLS 2005, and AMBER force fields yield the most accurate electrostatic and configurational treatment of the complex bis-MTX dimerizer. While initial attempts at calculating the binding free energy of the macromolecular complex have been unsuccessful, we have gleaned important insights into the complexities of modeling this three-body system. The advances described within the following work delineate important aspects of protein interface remodeling in a chemically induced system and provide an avenue toward the further development of both a computational model of protein interactions and the future directed assembly of protein based materials and therapeutic nanostructures...|$|R
5000|$|The Model 1889 was {{the first}} in the series of Schmidt-Rubin rifles which served Switzerland from 1889 to 1953. The rifle takes its name from the {{designer}} of its action, Colonel Rudolf Schmidt, and the designer of its ammunition, Colonel Eduard Rubin. Production of the rifle began in 1891. The straight-pull bolt action allows the user to pull the bolt <b>straight</b> back to <b>unlock</b> the action and eject the spent cartridge in one motion, and push the bolt forward to chamber a round, cock the striker, and lock the action. This is as opposed to a traditional bolt action, wherein the user must lift the bolt handle to unlock the action before pulling the bolt back. The rifle is roughly musket length with a free-floating barrel, 12-round magazine and wood stock that extends almost to the tip of the barrel. The Schmidt-Rubin 1889 was an advanced weapon for its time.The Schmidt-Rubin 1889 {{was one of the first}} rifles to use copper-jacketed ammunition as its standard ammunition. The GP90 7.5×53.5mm round designed by Col. Rubin in 1882 was revolutionary in that most of the bullets used in Europe at the time, except for the Mle 1886 Lebel rifle metal-jacketed 8mm bullet, were around [...]45 inches as opposed to the [...]308 inches of the Schmidt-Rubin ammunition. Strangely enough the round was [...] "paper patched" [...] meaning that the bullet was surrounded by a piece of paper, much like the cotton patches placed around a musket ball. Paper patching the round was supposed to aid in the lubrication of the bullet. In 1923, long after the discontinuation of the Model 1889, the GP90/23 7.5×53.5mm round was produced without the paper patching. The Model 1889 was eventually replaced by its successor models including the Model 1896, Model 96/11, Model 1911, Model 1911 carbine and the famous K-31.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is motivated by}} a belief that advanced learners of a second language can continue to develop their skills towards bilingualism, and it emerges from a desire to facilitate that process. A key assumption {{of the study is}} that conscious insight into a learners first language (L 1) can better inform second language (L 2) pedagogies and empower the learner by engaging their own expertise in their first language. Specifically, this investigation is concerned with learners whose first language is Korean (KL 1) and the second language is English (EL 2). Translations from Korean to English (KE) comprise the data for this investigation, since they provide complete samples of Korean and English language use for comparison, where the meaning is kept relatively constant. Two Korean Source Texts (KSTs) were both translated into English by one EL 1 and two KL 1 users, (eight texts in total). This data enabled comparisons between the original meaning in Korean and the transferral of this meaning into English, in terms of natural language use by L 1 users. In addition, the KL 1 English translations also revealed how well this transfer of meaning was done by the L 2 translators. This second objective identified key problematic areas in advanced English use by KL 1 speakers. This study investigated resources used to construe experiential meaning, which is one of four domains of meaning identified in Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) and is concerned with how language represents the inner and outer worlds of experience, as events unfolding in time. Since the two KSTs are reporting text types, the findings pertain largely to Relational and Material processes. Among these findings are indications that there are morphological clues within Korean language, attached to Relational processes, which can help predict the use of determiners (traditionally, articles) in English use. This feature of English has long been recognised as problematic for KL 1 English speakers (persisting even for those with advanced language skills), yet it is one which tends to be elucidated only with reference to English nominal groups. However, this research shows that both the form of the Korean verbal group (process), with consideration of its relating function, can signal appropriate determiner selection in English. Such findings have implications in terms of <b>unlocking</b> potential <b>tools</b> for second language development, particularly for more autonomous learners, such as advanced speakers, based on comparative insight into their own language...|$|R
