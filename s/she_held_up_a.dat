2500|$|Saturday Night Live had no foreknowledge of O'Connor's plan; {{during the}} dress rehearsal, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{photo of a}} refugee child. NBC Vice-President of Late Night Rick Ludwin {{recalled}} that when he saw O'Connor's action, he [...] "literally jumped out of [...] chair." [...] SNL writer Paula Pell recalled personnel in the control booth discussing the cameras cutting away from the singer. The audience was completely silent, with no booing or applause; executive producer Lorne Michaels recalled that [...] "the air went out the studio". [...] Michaels ordered that the applause sign not be used.|$|E
2500|$|On Madonna's next {{appearance}} on SNL, after singing [...] "Bad Girl", <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> photo of Joey Buttafuoco and, saying [...] "fight the real enemy", tore it up. Madonna also roundly attacked O'Connor {{in the press}} for the incident, telling the Irish Times: [...] "I {{think there is a}} better way to present her ideas rather than ripping up an image that means a lot to other people." [...] She added, [...] "If she is against the Roman Catholic Church and she has a problem with them, I think she should talk about it." [...] The New York Times called it [...] "professional jealousy" [...] and wrote: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> knife {{which she}} had found half buried near the fire.|$|E
6000|$|On {{her side}} she was, as I believe, equally {{astonished}} and equally confounded, but {{better able to}} conceal it. For the moment, and only for the moment, she too had nothing to say. Then she lifted her left hand from under her shawl. [...] "You have caught me, Mr. David!" [...] <b>she</b> said--and <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> drawing-book as <b>she</b> spoke.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, {{the child}} shook out {{something}} from a knotted mass of sea-grass, which <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> with <b>a</b> perfect shriek of delight. It was a bracelet of hair, fastened by a brilliant clasp of green, sparkling stones, such as {{she had never seen}} before. She redoubled her cries of delight, as she saw it sparkle between her and the sun, calling upon her father.|$|R
25|$|El Sit Cha'wane is {{a famous}} {{figure in the}} Druze religion. Like Job in the Old Testament, <b>she</b> was <b>held</b> <b>up</b> as <b>a</b> model of virtue and devotion. A feretory was erected in her name.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> warning finger as {{he lowered}} his mouth to the lips of the boy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{your eyes}} are not like mine. Look, can you see this?" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> small stone phial which she took from her bosom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jack, I'm {{going to}} root harder than I ever did in my life," [...] said Ruth, as <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> banner marked Colby Hall and another marked Clearwater Hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no! I don't blame them. Who am I, {{to do such}} a thing? It's we--people like me, of my class--who {{make the}} poor betray one another. But this dreadful fighting--this hideous paper is full of it!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> extra, {{crumpled}} with her nervous reading. [...] "Can't something be done to stop it? Don't you think that if some one went among them, {{and tried to make}} them see how perfectly hopeless it was to resist the companies and drive off the new men, he might do some good? I have wanted to go and try; but I am a woman, and I mustn't! I shouldn't be afraid of the strikers, but I'm afraid of what people would say!" [...] Conrad kept pressing his handkerchief to the cut in his temple, which he thought might be bleeding, and now she noticed this. [...] "Are you hurt, Mr. Dryfoos? You look so pale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{then there}} is such dreadful tear and wear of clothes," [...] {{continued}} Molly; [...] "just look at that, now!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to view <b>a</b> sock {{with a hole in}} its heel large enough to let an orange through.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> her face, <b>a</b> little timidly, and {{he kissed}} her. Afterwards, {{he watched her}} turn with slow, {{reluctant}} footsteps to the unpromising abode which she had pointed out. Aynesworth {{made his way to}} the inn, cursing his impecuniosity and Wingrave's brutal indifference.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not this?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{corner of}} the shroud, and as she saw my face and {{realized}} the answer before I spoke, went on: [...] "With all it implies?" ...|$|E
60|$|Timidly <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> silken purse {{towards the}} {{astonished}} wizard. Three gold pieces!--why, 'twas a fortune, the like {{of which the}} worthy Abra had never beheld in one sum in his life.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{tendency}} to laugh at this explanation, which Susy did not check, {{but after a few}} moments <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> finger, which produced instant silence, while she drew a letter from her pocket.|$|E
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>she</b> spoke, Nellie <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> ball of what {{appeared}} to be twine, and her companion--whose mind resembled that of a child, in that it could be easily diverted--said no, she didn't know what it was for, and that she, (Peggy), had seen her making it when the men were off excursioning, and had asked about it; and why didn't she, (Nellie), relieve her curiosity before, upon the point, instead of waitin' till now? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> her hand. <b>A</b> slow pulsation, {{that might}} have been the dull, labored beating of their own hearts, was making itself felt {{throughout}} the little cottage. It came nearer,--a deep regular inspiration that seemed slowly to fill and possess the whole tranquil summer twilight. It was nearer still--was abreast of the house--passed--grew fainter and at last died away like a deep-drawn sigh. It was the down boat, that was now separating Mr. Hamlin and his protegee, even as it had once brought them together.|$|R
60|$|Another {{moment and}} she had almost reached the man, and still {{pointing}} began to gasp some broken words. Then, suddenly in the bright moonlight, Metem saw a shining point of light flash towards the pair from {{the darkness of the}} tree. It would seem that Elissa saw it also; at least, she leapt from the ground, her arm lifted above her head as though to catch the object. Then as her feet once more touched the earth her knees gave way, and she fell down with a moan of pain. Metem running on towards her, as he went perceived a shape, which looked like that of a black dwarf, slip from the shadow of the tree into some bushes beyond where it was lost. Now he was there, to find Elissa half-seated, half-lying on the ground, the prince Aziel bending over her, and fixed through the palm of her right hand, which <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> piteously, <b>a</b> little ivory-pointed arrow.|$|R
60|$|The girl silenced him, {{and though}} {{the next two or}} three minutes were, perhaps, as {{unpleasant}} as any Jimmy had ever spent in his life, it was with a certain deep relief that he heard his sister out. Before she stopped <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> white hand.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> finger. [...] "Hush! No more of that. We are forgetting, {{and you are}} {{becoming}} personal." [...] She said this in a tone peculiarly at variance with the words. [...] "Now read me the scenario of the new play. I am eager to know what has moved you, set you on high again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doctor Marsh, and my dear people," [...] {{she said}} at last, [...] "I--I {{scarcely}} know how to reply. You overrate me altogether; but--but, if I rule at all, I will do so by the blessed truths of this book (<b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> Bible); and--and before taking a single step further I appoint as my--my Prime Minister--if I may so call him--Joe Binney." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{she shut}} the door sharply. The {{fugitive}} had made a blunder. The importation of her own uncertain sex into the explanation did not help him. She kept on towards the house, however, without the least trace of excitement or agitation in her manner, entered the front door again, walked quietly {{to the door of the}} inner room, glanced in, saw that her husband was absorbed in splicing a riata, and had evidently not missed her, and returned quietly to her dish-washing. With this singular difference: a few moments before she had seemed inattentive and careless of what she was doing, as if from some abstraction; now, when she was actually abstracted, her movements were mechanically perfect and deliberate. <b>She</b> carefully <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> dish and examined it minutely for cracks, rubbing it cautiously with the towel, but seeing all the while only the man she had left in the barn. A few moments elapsed. Then there came another rush of wind around the house, a drifting cloud of dust before the door, the clatter of hoofs, and a quick shout.|$|R
5|$|Comfort, however, {{asserts that}} McClintock was well {{regarded}} by her professional peers, {{even in the}} early years of her career. Although Comfort argues that McClintock was not a victim of gender discrimination, she has been widely written about in the context of women's studies. Most recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of her experience. <b>She</b> is <b>held</b> <b>up</b> as <b>a</b> role model for girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize Geneticist, Deborah Heiligman's Barbara McClintock: Alone in Her Field and Mary Kittredge's Barbara McClintock. A recent biography for young adults by Naomi Pasachoff, Barbara McClintock, Genius of Genetics, provides a new perspective, based on the current literature.|$|R
6000|$|But poor Saphir was so unhappy, {{and begged}} {{so hard for}} forgiveness, that at last the Frog's anger gave way, and <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to him <b>a</b> tiny diamond stone. 'Go back,' she said, 'to the castle, and bury this little diamond close to the door. But {{be careful not to}} return to the stable or to the bedroom; they have proved too fatal to you. Walk {{straight}} to the garden and enter through a portico, into a small green wood, in the midst of which is a tree with a trunk of gold and leaves of emeralds. Perched on this tree you will see the beautiful bird you have been seeking so long. You must cut the branch on which it is sitting, and bring it back to me without delay. But I warn you solemnly that if you disobey my directions, as you have done twice before, you have nothing more to expect either of me or anyone else.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> smart ivory walking-cane, with {{a bright}} silk tassel attached. With her cane in one hand, and her {{chemical}} bottle in the other--and her roguish little hat {{on the top of}} her head--she made the quaintest and prettiest picture I had seen for many a long day. [...] "You shall guide me, my dear," [...] I said--and took her arm. We went on down the village.|$|E
60|$|Miranda, {{hearing him}} so silent, rose. At this hour {{it was her}} master's habit to scratch paper. She, who seldom {{scratched}} anything, {{because it was not}} delicate, felt dimly that this was what he should be doing. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> slim foot and touched his knee. Receiving no discouragement, she delicately sprang into his lap, and, forgetting for once her modesty, placed her arms on his chest, and licked his face all over.|$|E
60|$|Then Mr. Direck, in {{accordance}} with a habit that had been growing on him throughout the evening, looked around for Miss Cissie Corner and failed to find her. And then behold she was descending the staircase with the mysterious baby in her arms. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> warning finger, and then glanced at her sleeping burthen. She looked like a silvery Madonna. And Mr. Direck remembered {{that he was still}} in doubt about that baby....|$|E
6000|$|Nothing, again, {{could be}} more prosaic and impenetrable than the {{domestic}} energies of Miss Diana Duke. But Innocent had somehow blundered on the discovery that her thrifty dressmaking went with a considerable feminine care for dress--the one feminine thing that had never failed her solitary self-respect. In consequence Smith pestered her with a theory (which he really seemed to take seriously) that ladies might combine economy with magnificence if they would draw light chalk patterns on a plain dress and then dust them off again. He set up [...] "Smith's Lightning Dressmaking Company," [...] with two screens, a cardboard placard, and box of bright soft crayons; and Miss Diana actually threw him an abandoned black overall or working dress on which to exercise the talents of a modiste. He promptly produced for her a garment aflame with red and gold sunflowers; <b>she</b> <b>held</b> it <b>up</b> <b>an</b> instant to her shoulders, and looked like an empress. And Arthur Inglewood, some hours afterwards cleaning his bicycle (with his usual air of being inextricably hidden in it), glanced up; and his hot face grew hotter, for Diana stood laughing for one flash in the doorway, and her dark robe was rich with the green and purple of great decorative peacocks, like a secret garden in the [...] "Arabian Nights." [...] A pang too swift to be named pain or pleasure went through his heart like an old-world rapier. He remembered how pretty he thought her years ago, when {{he was ready to}} fall in love with anybody; but it was like remembering a worship of some Babylonian princess in some previous existence. At his next glimpse of her (and he caught himself awaiting it) the purple and green chalk was dusted off, and she went by quickly in her working clothes.|$|R
2500|$|Babe {{focuses on}} several projects, such as keeping Fusion running, working on {{acquiring}} her GED, and helping Krystal {{with her new}} business venture of revamping the Roadside Bar, now titled The Comeback. She also becomes close to Jamie again. <b>She</b> is <b>held</b> <b>up</b> when <b>a</b> man thought to be Annie Lavery's brother, Richie Novak, comes to Krystal's bar looking to rob the place. A new guy named Wes, who shows an immediate attraction to her, is there to help her fend off the ex-convict. The robber is soon after discovered to be dead, {{and that he was}} not Annie Lavery's brother after all, but was rather a man her brother most likely hired to [...] "play" [...] the part of Richie. Due to their experience in the hold up together, Babe and Wes grow closer and she gives him a chance at a romantic relationship with her by going out on a date with him. While on the date, and after a few uncomfortable moments with JR, as well as advice to Amanda about being wary of JR, Babe agrees to another date with Wes. After more time spent with him, it is eventually revealed that he is Richie Novak.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> her finger, {{and glanced}} {{backward}} {{out of the}} window.|$|R
60|$|In {{the rose}} garden, which {{had taken the}} place of the old fernery, he could see Irene snipping and pruning, with a little basket on her arm. She was never idle, it seemed to him, and he envied her now that he himself was idle nearly all his time. He went down to her. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> stained glove and smiled. A piece of lace tied under her chin {{concealed}} her hair, and her oval face with its still dark brows looked very young.|$|E
6000|$|... "I picked this up on {{the church}} floor," [...] she said shyly, [...] "so I {{reckoned}} you HAD be'n there,--though the parson said you hadn't,--and I just excused myself and ran out to give it ye. It's yourn, ain't it?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> gold specimen pin, which he had put on {{in honor of the}} occasion. [...] "I had a harder time, though, to git this yer,--it's yourn too,--for Billy was laying down in the yard, back o' the church, and just comf'bly swallerin' it." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{wanted to}} ask {{if she were a}} Mormon by religion, but the {{question}} seemed curious and unnecessary. His interest was aroused; he realized suddenly that he had found pleasure in her low voice; it was new and strange, unlike any woman's voice he had ever heard; and he regarded her closely. He had only time for a glance at her straight, clean-cut profile, when she turned startled eyes on him, eyes black as the night. And they were eyes that looked through and beyond him. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> hand, slowly bent toward the wind, and whispered: ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was pale}} and trembling, but <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> and looked inquiringly.|$|R
60|$|The footman {{tried to}} strike me again, but <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> her hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> her finger. The {{door was}} quietly opened. Mr. Parker entered.|$|R
