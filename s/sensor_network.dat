To implement various applications, such as weather forecasting and environmental observation, with integrated <b>sensor</b> <b>networks,</b> users (clients) usually aggregate and collect the sensor data obtained from all the <b>sensor</b> <b>networks.</b> After this, the clients execute some operations, such as averaging and analysis, on the aggregated sensor data. However, such processes cause heavy network traffic in aggregating data from all the <b>sensor</b> <b>networks.</b> Hence, in this paper, we propose a data aggregation system using mobile agents.
