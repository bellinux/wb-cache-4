We identify that data requirements, lack of examples of RDM in actual decision-making, limited applicability for surprise events, and resource constraints are likely to constrain successful application of RDM approaches in developing countries. We discuss opportunities for RDM approaches to address decision problems associated with urban socio-environmental and water-energy-food nexus issues, forest resources management, disaster risk management and conservation management issues. We examine potential entry points for RDM approaches through Environmental Impact Assessments and Strategic Environmental Assessments, which are relatively well established in decision making processes in many developing countries. We conclude that despite some barriers, and with modification, RDM approaches show potential for wider application in developing country contexts...|$|R

40|$|Introduction] The {{notion of}} 'smart specialisation' {{is set to}} become an {{important}} policy rationale in the upcoming structural funding period 2014 - 2020. Although the original academic concept of this policy approach was sectorally oriented and rooted {{in the analysis of}} the EU-US productivity gap (e. g. Foray et al. 2009), the concept is increasingly applied to regional contexts. Essential for the application of the smart specialisation concept in a regional context is the fact that regions are often faced with scarce resources and limited budgets which they should allocate according to external influences (e. g. global competition) and inherited structures (<b>sectoral</b> <b>foci,</b> linkages between sectors, innovation infrastructure). Therefore, and in accordance with the smart specialisation strategy (S 3), regional governments need to design policies {{in such a way as}} to support the most promising areas of present and future comparative advantage in order to foster regional prosperity. Although the ideas behind smart specialisation are not entirely new on the regional level, the smart specialisation concept is going to expand its influence to regional innovation policy making. Thus, this contribution illuminates the interface between the smart specialisation concept and regional systems of innovation approach, since innovation is going to be a key issue in the next structural funding period. Key arguments for the usefulness of the smart specialisation concept in the field of the design of regional innovation policy making will be collected and three examples are presented in form of case studies. This contribution aims to demonstrate that the principles of smart specialisation have been implicitly applied in certain European regions for years in form of future-oriented transformation processes. Likewise this contribution aims to illustrate how the experiences from these regions can contribute to policy learning. In doing so, the structure is the following: firstly, existing literature on the smart specialisation concept is revised and secondly, these findings are reconsidered with regard to the regional systems of innovation approach. In particular, if and how the smart specialisation concept will influence regional development processes and potentially regional innovation systems. Three key working theses adopt these ideas and guide the empirical analyses. Methodologically, the paper pursues a case study approach. The policy trajectories of three different case study regions are analysed within the innovation systems approach and conclusions are drawn concerning the smart specialisation concept. Finally, the paper closes with a conclusion, concerning the influencing potential of the smart specialisation concept on regional innovation systems...|$|R

Although its definition is contested the essence of business incubation is enhancing the survival of growth-oriented early-stage enterprises.

Service-sector enterprises have emerged in some countries as a new focus for business incubation. It is observed that alongside cultural and creative industries that business incubation is extended into the tourism sector. Business incubation is therefore an additional tool for tourism SMME support. Currently, most tourism business incubators are found in USA and Europe. In South Africa, however, there has occurred the launch of dedicated business incubators to support tourism entrepreneurs.

Traditionally, NI planning and implementation has been conducted in isolation, based upon fixed assumptions about the future.

The pattern is more complex than a simple North-South divide but a number of places in southern England have substantially more jobs in these sectors than industrial cities such as Bradford, Leicester, Manchester, Middlesbrough, Nottingham, Stoke and Swansea.  - The distribution across the country of research and development establishments – along with universities and R&D labs in large companies likely to be first in line for the new R&D funding – is particularly skewed in favour of an arc to the immediate north, west and south of London.  - Even excluding its famous university, the Cambridge area (population just 285, 000) has twice as many jobs in scientific research and development establishments as the whole of the Midlands, more than Scotland and Wales combined, and only 2, 000 fewer than the whole of the North of England (population 15. 2 million).  - The report concludes that the government’s <b>sectoral</b> <b>focus</b> is exceptionally narrow – too narrow alone to provide a base on which to build a revival of British industry.  - The report also concludes that the government’s narrow <b>sectoral</b> <b>focus</b> threatens to widen regional divides.
