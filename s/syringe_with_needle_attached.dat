40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the use of DGF as a quantitative measurement in estimating the level of abuse deterrence to intravenous injection. Background. In developing solid oral medications resistant to various forms of recreational abuse, proper selection of inactive ingredients that can resist common tampering methods is critical. Of particular concern is preventing abuse by injecting the drug extract intravenously or intramuscularly. Given the fact that there is no standards which to measure injectability of drug solutions extracted from abuse-deterrent medications, the injectability of such extracts needs to be performed using reliable and reproducible methods. As such, this study suggests the use of DGF as a standard measurement of injectability for quantitative and qualitative purposes related to parenteral resistance. Methods. Using a common abuse deterrent ingredient (Polyox™ WSR Coagulant NF), 2. 5 % w/v of Polyox solutions were prepared in water, normal saline, pH 3 and 40 % ethanol solvents. These solutions were loaded into 3 mL <b>syringes</b> <b>with</b> an <b>attached</b> <b>needle</b> (19 G X 1. 5 ”), and the DGF of each solution measured at four rates (0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 mm/sec) using a texture analyzer equipped <b>with</b> a <b>syringe</b> fixture. Results. DGF increased gradually when rate of injection was increased for all solvents excluding 40 % ethanol. DGF increased rapidly with increasing rate for 40 % ethanol. Conclusion. DGF can reproducibly be used to measure injectability over a wide range of injection rates and extracting solvents. Grants. NSU grants # 335357 and 33582...|$|R

40|$|Many {{people who}} inject drugs (PWID) use <b>syringes</b> <b>with</b> {{detachable}} <b>needles,</b> which have high dead space (HDS). Contaminated HDS blood may substantially {{contribute to the}} transmission of HIV, hepatitis C (HCV), and other blood-borne viruses within this population. Newly designed low dead space (LDS) syringe-needle combinations seek to reduce blood-borne virus transmission among PWID. We evaluated the infectivity of HCV-contaminated residual volumes recovered from two LDS syringe-needle combinations. We tested two different design approaches to reducing the dead space. One added a piston to the plunger; the other reduced the dead space within the needle. The two approaches cannot be combined. Recovery of genotype- 2 a reporter HCV from LDS syringe-needle combinations was compared to recovery from insulin <b>syringes</b> <b>with</b> fixed <b>needles</b> and standard HDS syringe-needle combinations. Recovery of HCV from syringes was determined immediately following their contamination with HCV-spiked plasma, after storage at 22 °C for up to 1 week, or after rinsing <b>with</b> water. Insulin <b>syringes</b> <b>with</b> fixed <b>needles</b> had the lowest proportion of HCV-positive syringes before and after storage. HCV recovery after immediate use ranged from 47 %± 4 % HCV-positive 1 mL insulin <b>syringes</b> <b>with</b> 27 -gauge ½ inch needles to 98 %± 1 % HCV-positive HDS 2 mL <b>syringes</b> <b>with</b> 23 -gauge 1 ¼ inch detachable needles.
