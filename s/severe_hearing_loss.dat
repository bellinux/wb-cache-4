25|$|Another sign of Stickler {{syndrome}} is mild to <b>severe</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> that, for some people, may be progressive (see hearing loss with craniofacial syndromes). The joints of affected {{children and young}} adults may be very flexible (hypermobile). Arthritis often appears at an early age and worsens as a person gets older. Learning difficulties, not intelligence, can also occur because of hearing and sight impairments if the school is not informed and the student is not assisted within the learning environment.|$|E
25|$|This type of assistive {{technology}} {{allows users to}} amplify the volume and clarity of their phone calls {{so that they can}} easily partake in this medium of communication. There are also options to adjust the frequency and tone of a call to suit their individual hearing needs. Additionally, there is a wide variety of amplified telephones to choose from, with different degrees of amplification. For example, a phone with 26 to 40 decibel is generally sufficient for mild hearing loss, while a phone with 71 to 90 decibel is better for more <b>severe</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the ear aids (ITE) devices fit in {{the outer}} ear bowl (called the concha). Being larger, these are easier to insert and can hold extra features.

2500|$|In March 2011, Roger Daltrey {{said in an}} {{interview}} with the BBC that Townshend had recently experienced gradual but <b>severe</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and was now trying to save what remained of his hearing: [...] "Pete's having terrible trouble with his hearing. He's got really, really bad problems with it...not tinnitus, it's deterioration and he's seriously now worried about actually losing his hearing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Behind the ear {{aids are}} also called [...] "receiver-in-the-aid" [...] or RITA devices. These devices {{are useful for}} people who require {{significant}} amplification across many frequencies due to moderate to <b>severe</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Larger models tend to be easier to handle for changing batteries or configuring controls. The earmolds on these are easier to clean than other sorts of devices, but they also will be more visible and prone to buildup of wax. If the earmold is not vented then that can make the ear feel plugged.|$|E
2500|$|The {{retinoblastoma}} protein {{is involved in}} the growth and development of mammalian hair cells of the cochlea, and appears {{to be related to the}} cells' inability to regenerate. Embryonic hair cells require Rb, among other important proteins, to exit the cell-cycle and stop dividing, which allows maturation of the auditory system. Once wild-type mammals have reached adulthood, their cochlear hair cells become incapable of proliferation. In studies where the gene for Rb is deleted in mice cochlea, hair cells continue to proliferate in early adulthood. Though this may seem to be a positive development, Rb-knockdown mice tend to develop <b>severe</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> due to degeneration of the organ of Corti. For this reason, Rb seems to be instrumental for completing the development of mammalian hair cells and keeping them alive. However, it is clear that without Rb, hair cells have the ability to proliferate, which is why Rb is known as a tumor suppressor. Temporarily and precisely turning off Rb in adult mammals with damaged hair cells may lead to propagation and therefore successful regeneration. [...] Suppressing function of the {{retinoblastoma protein}} in the adult rat cochlea has been found to cause proliferation of supporting cells and hair cells. Rb can be downregulated by activating the sonic hedgehog pathway, which phosphorylates the proteins and reduces gene transcription.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To update a 15 -year-old {{study of}} 800 postlinguistically deaf adult {{patients}} showing how duration of <b>severe</b> to profound <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> age at cochlear implantation (CI), age at onset of <b>severe</b> to profound <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> etiology and CI experience affected CI outcome. Study Design: Retrospective multicenter study. Methods: Data from 2251 adult patients implanted since 2003 in 15 international centers were collected and speech scores in quiet {{were converted to}} percentile ranks to remove differences between centers. Results: The negative effect of long duration of <b>severe</b> to profound <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was less important in the new data than in 1996; the effects of age at CI and age at onset of <b>severe</b> to profound <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> were delayed until older ages; etiology had a smaller effect, {{and the effect of}} CI experience was greater with a steeper learning curve. Patients with longer durations of <b>severe</b> to profound <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> were less likely to improve with CI experience than patients with shorter duration of <b>severe</b> to profound <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Conclusions: The factors that were relevant in 1996 were still relevant in 2011, although their relative importance had changed. Relaxed patient selection criteria, improved clinical management of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> modifications of surgical practice, and improved devices may explain the differences.

2500|$|Extended wear {{hearing aids}} are hearing devices that are non-surgically {{placed in the}} ear canal by a hearing professional. [...] The {{extended}} wear hearing aid represents the first [...] "invisible" [...] hearing device. These devices are worn for 1–3 {{months at a time}} without removal. [...] They are made of soft material designed to contour to each user and can be used by people with mild to moderately <b>severe</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Their close proximity to the ear drum results in improved sound directionality and localization, reduced feedback, and improved high frequency gain. While traditional BTE or ITC hearing aids require daily insertion and removal, extended wear hearing aids are worn continuously and then replaced with a new device. [...] Users can change volume and settings without the aid of a hearing professional. The devices are very useful for active individuals because their design protects against moisture and earwax and can be worn while exercising, showering, etc. [...] Because the device’s placement within the ear canal makes them invisible to observers, extended wear hearing aids are popular with those who are self-conscious about the aesthetics of BTE or ITC hearing aid models. As with other hearing devices, compatibility is based on an individual’s hearing loss, ear size and shape, medical conditions, and lifestyle. [...] The disadvantages include regular removal and reinsertion of the device when the battery dies, inability to go underwater, earplugs when showering, and for some discomfort with the fit since it is inserted deeply in the ear canal, {{the only part of the}} body where skin rests directly on top of bone.|$|E

Henry Blake {{was injured}} four times: once by a disgruntled chopper pilot ("Cowboy"), once by {{friendly}} fire ("The Army-Navy Game"), and in season 3, episode 15 ("Bombed"), Henry is injured {{when he is}} blown up while in the latrine. (The gag of Blake being caught in an exploding latrine {{is also in the}} episode [...] "Cowboy".) Henry is also injured when the latrine catches fire. Father Mulcahy is given a concussion on two separate occasions - first in the episode [...] "Bombed", where he is in the latrine stall next to Blake when it is blown up; and again in [...] "Goodbye, Farewell and Amen" [...] when he is knocked out by mortar fire which strikes close by him; he also suffers <b>severe</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{as a result of this}} incident. Frank Burns is twice awarded Purple Hearts for spurious injuries: throwing his back out after he gave Margaret a dip and could not move - which was later covered up with a story that he slipped on the way to the showers ("Sometimes You Hear the Bullet", 1.17), and getting an egg-shell fragment in the eye ("The Kids", 4.8). Burns' Purple Heart medals were then given to more deserving people: a GI who was admitted with appendicitis and a Korean newborn infant who was hit by a bullet in utero.|$|E

However, there are new ITEs made from a silicone type material that mitigates the need for costly replacements.ITE hearing aids can be connected wirelessly to FM systems, for instance with a body-worn FM receiver with induction neck-loop which transmits the audio signal from the FM transmitter inductively to the telecoil inside the hearing instrument.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to determine auditory neuropathy in the students with <b>severe</b> to profound <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> in Ahwaz.
