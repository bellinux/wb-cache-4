The spectrum is either filtered or generated in single successive frequency steps and reconstructed before Fourier-transformation. By accommodation of a frequency scanning light source (i.e. frequency scanning laser) the optical setup (see Fig. 3) becomes simpler than SEFD, but the problem of scanning is essentially translated from the TD-OCT reference-arm into the TEFD-OCT light source.|$|E

However, the degree of <b>spatial</b> <b>separation</b> of social classes was moderate by the standards of other cities in South America. Starting in the 1970s, the city began to acquire a belt of shantytowns around its outskirts, but in 1990 these remained small compared with Rio de Janeiro or Guayaquil, for example. About 60,000 families lived in such shantytowns, known in Uruguay as cantegriles. An intensive program of public housing construction was undertaken in the 1970s and 1980s, but it had not solved the problem by 1990.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, Ernst (2008) advocates that {{efficient}} integration initially relies upon establishing correspondence – which sensory signals belong together. Indeed, {{studies have}} shown that visuo-haptic integration fails in adults when there is a perceived <b>spatial</b> <b>separation,</b> suggesting sensory information is coming from different targets. Furthermore, if the separation can be explained, for example viewing an object through a mirror, integration is re-established and can even be optimal. Ernst (2008) suggests that adults can obtain this knowledge from previous experiences to quickly determine which sensory sources depict the same target, but young children could be deficient in this area. Once there is a sufficient bank of experiences, confidence to correctly integrate sensory signals can then be introduced in their behaviour.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 34 - 43). Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is {{a transitional}} state between normal aging and dementia. Of the cognitive abilities that may decline in MCI (e. g., memory, language, executive functioning, visuospatial processing), memory {{is of particular}} interest for identifying individuals who may progress and develop Alzheimer's disease (AD). A particular mnemonic mechanism that declines in older adults is <b>spatial</b> pattern <b>separation.</b> <b>Spatial</b> pattern <b>separation</b> reduces the interference among spatially similar memory representations and increases the probability of accurate encoding and retrieval. Examining <b>spatial</b> pattern <b>separation</b> in MCI may provide insight into a specific memory mechanism that is adversely affected by MCI associated pathology. 	Pattern separation is facilitated by the dentate gyrus (DG) and the CA 3 subregions of the hippocampus. Individuals with the clinical subtype amnestic MCI (aMCI) evidence hyperactivity in the DG and CA 3 subregions as well as smaller DG and CA 3 subregion volumes compared to individuals without MCI. Previous studies in humans have suggested that individuals with MCI are impaired when performing a non-spatial pattern separation task compared to controls; however, no study to date has examined whether individuals with MCI evidence impaired performance on a <b>spatial</b> pattern <b>separation</b> task. 	The current study used a <b>spatial</b> pattern <b>separation</b> task developed in our laboratory to examine whether individuals with MCI evidence <b>spatial</b> pattern <b>separation</b> deficits compared to age-matched controls. The task involved the presentation of a single circle on a computer screen and then after a delay, the presentation of two circles [...] one target circle in the same location as the original circle and one foil circle in a different location. Participants were asked to indicate which of the two circles was in the same location as the original circle. Four possible distances separated the edges of the target and foil circle: 0. 0 cm, 0. 5 cm, 1. 0 cm, or 1. 5 cm. Smaller distances between the target and foil circle were hypothesized to result in increased interference and heightened demand for <b>spatial</b> pattern <b>separation.</b> 	Data were analyzed using a 2 x 4 repeated measures ANOVA with group (MCI, control) as the between subjects variable and separation distance (0 cm, 0. 5 cm, 1. 0 cm, and 1. 5 cm) as the within subject variable. Healthy older adults were predicted to perform significantly better on the <b>spatial</b> pattern <b>separation</b> task compared to individuals with an MCI diagnosis. However, the present analyses revealed no significant differences on the <b>spatial</b> pattern <b>separation</b> task between individuals diagnosed with MCI and healthy older adults. Although the present findings suggest that an MCI diagnosis may not adversely affect <b>spatial</b> pattern <b>separation,</b> future studies examining particular subtypes of MCI (e. g., aMCI) or MCI groups diagnosed using more conservative criteria are needed to further examine the effect of MCI on <b>spatial</b> pattern <b>separation...</b>|$|R

With the introduction of DESI as an ion source for ion mobility mass spectrometry, applications for IMS have expanded from only vapor-phase samples with volatile analyses to also in tact structures and aqueous samples. When coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, analysis of proteins is also possible. These techniques work in tandem to one another to investigate ion shapes and reactiveness after ionization.

The Florentine annunciations have a number of iconographic similarities to the Ghent panels, including Gabriel's multi-colored wings, the upside down writing, the treatment of light beams, and the separation between angel and virgin by a thin architectural feature. Some of these elements, particularly the <b>spatial</b> <b>separation</b> between the two figures, can be found in Lorenzo Monaco's Bartolini Salimbeni Annunciation in Santa Trinita, finished before his death in 1424, and one that Jan may have seen. In Monaco's painting the angel and Mary are separated by two small spaces, one external and one internal, similar to the city-scape and domestic lavabo panels in the Ghent annunciation.|$|E
25|$|In practice, PCR {{can fail}} for various reasons, {{in part due}} to its {{sensitivity}} to contamination causing amplification of spurious DNA products. Because of this, a number of techniques and procedures have been developed for optimizing PCR conditions. Contamination with extraneous DNA is addressed with lab protocols and procedures that separate pre-PCR mixtures from potential DNA contaminants. This usually involves <b>spatial</b> <b>separation</b> of PCR-setup areas from areas for analysis or purification of PCR products, use of disposable plasticware, and thoroughly cleaning the work surface between reaction setups. Primer-design techniques are important in improving PCR product yield and in avoiding the formation of spurious products, and the usage of alternate buffer components or polymerase enzymes can help with amplification of long or otherwise problematic regions of DNA. Addition of reagents, such as formamide, in buffer systems may increase the specificity and yield of PCR. Computer simulations of theoretical PCR results (Electronic PCR) may be performed to assist in primer design.|$|E
40|$|Spatial memory deficits {{have been}} well {{documented}} in older adults and may serve as an early indicator of mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease in some individuals. Pattern separation is a critical mechanism for reducing potential interference among similar memory representations to enhance memory accuracy.

25|$|Waste {{material}} is removed continuously and deposited in refuse piles as above (or even by some Atta ants into streams). The {{division of labour}} in Acromyrmex echinatior leafcutter ants includes individuals who work almost exclusively in waste management: waste material (excreta, food refuse, etc.) frequently harbours Escovopsis (a microfungus that is parasitic on the fungus that A. echinatior tends) {{as well as other}} parasites, so <b>spatial</b> <b>separation</b> of waste material from the fungal garden and wider nest environment is of paramount importance. This is achieved by depositing waste material on downhill and downwind piles or in special deep underground refuse chambers. Distinct waste management workers also exist in Atta cephalotes and Atta colombica. The risk of waste-worker ants contaminating the fungal garden/nest is lowered by other ants attacking them if they try to enter the nest, whilst attacks are more frequent in species with internal refuse chambers (this also reinforces the division of labour). On the other hand, some species retain excreta and/or anal exudates within the nest to utilize it for antiparasite purposes: C. formosanus employs its faces as building material for the nest carton, the use of faceal material promotes the growth of Actinobacteria with natural antimicrobial activity (e.g. Streptomyces), combating fungal parasites like M. anisopliae. Colony members of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) defend themselves against the virulent Crithidia bombi parasite by consuming beneficial gut bacteria from the faces of conspecific after eclosing.|$|E

Exciplexes and nonemissive CT excitons were formed in composites with ΔLUMO 0. 6 eV, respectively. A competition between fast charge carrier photogeneration and CT exciton formation was observed, with outcomes depending on the applied electric field (E) and on the D/A separation. At low E fields, CT formation was dominant, and up to a factor of 2 increase in charge photogeneration efficiency due to CT exciton dissociation was observed in composites with large <b>spatial</b> D/A <b>separation</b> compared with that in pristine D films. At high E fields, fast charge carrier photogeneration was dominant in all composites, and no improvement in charge photogeneration efficiency with respect to that in pristine D films was observed.
