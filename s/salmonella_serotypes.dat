50|$|Salmonella {{species are}} facultative {{intracellular}} pathogens. Many infections {{are due to}} ingestion of contaminated food. <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> {{can be divided into}} two main groups—typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella. Nontyphoidal serotypes are more common, and usually cause self-limiting gastrointestinal disease. They can infect a range of animals, and are zoonotic, meaning they can be transferred between humans and other animals. Typhoidal serotypes include Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A, which are adapted to humans and do not occur in other animals.|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of food-borne salmonellosis due to <b>Salmonella</b> enterica <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden {{is reported to}} be on the increase in Malaysia. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping method was used to assess the extent of genetic diversity and clonality of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden strains from humans and the environment. PFGE of XbaI-digested chromosomal DNA from 95 strains of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden gave 39 distinct profiles {{with a wide range of}} Dice coefficients (0. 27 to 1. 00), indicating that PFGE is very discriminative and that multiple clones of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden exist among clinical and environmental isolates. Strains of one dominant pulsotype (pulsotype X 1 /X 2) appeared to be endemic in this region, as they were consistently recovered from humans with salmonellosis between 1996 and 2001 and from raw vegetables. In addition, the sharing of similar PFGE profiles among isolates from humans, vegetables, and beef provides indirect evidence of the possible transmission of salmonellosis from contaminated raw vegetables and meat to humans. Furthermore, the recurrence of PFGE profile X 21 among isolates found in samples of vegetables from one wet market indicated the persistence of this clone. The environment in the wet markets may represent a major source of cross-contamination of vegetables with <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden. Antibiotic sensitivity tests showed that the clinical isolates of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden remained drug sensitive but that the vegetable isolates were resistant to at least two antibiotics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare clinical and environmental isolates of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden in Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|The stationary-phase-inducible sigma factor, σS (RpoS), is {{the master}} {{regulator}} of the general stress response in Salmonella and is required for virulence in mice. rpoS mutants can frequently be isolated from highly passaged laboratory strains of Salmonella. We examined the rpoS status of 116 human clinical isolates of Salmonella, including 41 <b>Salmonella</b> enterica <b>serotype</b> Typhi strains isolated from blood, 38 S. enterica serotype Typhimurium strains isolated from blood, and 37 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium strains isolated from feces. We examined the abilities of these strains to produce the σS protein, to express RpoS-dependent catalase activity, and to resist to oxidative stress in the stationary phase of growth. We also carried out complementation experiments with a cloned wild-type rpoS gene. Our results showed that 15 of the 41 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhi isolates were defective in RpoS. We sequenced the rpoS allele of 12 strains. This led to identification of small insertions, deletions, and point mutations resulting in premature stop codons or affecting regions 1 and 2 of σS, showing that the rpoS mutations are not clonal. Thus, mutant rpoS alleles {{can be found in}} freshly isolated clinical strains of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhi, and they may affect virulence properties. Interestingly however, no rpoS mutants were found among the 75 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium isolates. Strains that differed in catalase activity and resistance to hydrogen peroxide were found, but the differences were not linked to the rpoS status. This suggests that <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium rpoS mutants are counterselected because rpoS plays a role in the pathogenesis of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium in humans or in the transmission cycle of the disease...|$|R
50|$|Typhoid fever {{is caused}} by <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> which are {{strictly}} adapted to humans or higher primates—these include Salmonella Typhi, Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B and Paratyphi C. In the systemic form of the disease, salmonellae pass through the lymphatic system of the intestine into {{the blood of the}} patients (typhoid form) and are carried to various organs (liver, spleen, kidneys) to form secondary foci (septic form). Endotoxins first act on the vascular and nervous apparatus, resulting in increased permeability and decreased tone of the vessels, upset of thermal regulation, and vomiting and diarrhoea. In severe forms of the disease, enough liquid and electrolytes are lost to upset the water-salt metabolism, decrease the circulating blood volume and arterial pressure, and cause hypovolemic shock. Septic shock may also develop. Shock of mixed character (with signs of both hypovolemic and septic shock) is more common in severe salmonellosis. Oliguria and azotemia may develop in severe cases as a result of renal involvement due to hypoxia and toxemia.|$|E
5000|$|The various {{outbreaks}} of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> in the U.S. and abroad began {{at different points}} either in late 2011 or early 2012; however, all cases were concluded {{at the end of}} 2012. Those who were infected either suffered through the symptoms or expired from Salmonellas destruction to their immune system. If there was a specific point of origin for an outbreak, a recall of the product helped to decrease more possible exposure. None of the people infected showed symptoms or maintained symptoms into 2013. This biotic disturbance had a major impact on society. It increased awareness about the ease in which bacteria spread among organisms. It helped to prompt researchers to look into ways to prevent crops from becoming contaminated in the field. Most importantly, this disturbance has been occurring with increasing frequency, which seems counter-intuitive because salmonellosis is an easily preventable disease; if simple food safety steps were taken, unnecessary hospitalizations and deaths could have been eliminated in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Salmonella enterica, {{through some}} of its serotypes such as Typhimurium and Enteriditis, shows signs {{of the ability to}} infect several {{different}} mammalian host species, while other serotypes such as Typhi seem to be restricted to only a few hosts. Some of the ways that <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> have adapted to their hosts include loss of genetic material and mutation. In more complex mammalian species, immune systems, which include pathogen specific immune responses, target serovars of Salmonella through binding of antibodies to structures like flagella. Through the loss of the genetic material that codes for a flagellum to form, Salmonella can evade a host's immune system. In the study by Kisela et al., more pathogenic serovars of S. enterica were found to have certain adhesins in common that have developed out of convergent evolution. This means that, as these strains of Salmonella have been exposed to similar conditions such as immune systems, similar structures evolved separately to negate these similar, more advanced defenses in hosts. There are still many questions about the way that Salmonella has evolved into so many different types but {{it has been suggested that}} Salmonella evolved through several phases. As Baumler et al. have suggested, Salmonella most likely evolved through horizontal gene transfer, formation of new serovars due to additional pathogenicity islands and through an approximation of its ancestry. So, Salmonella could have evolved into its many different serotypes through gaining genetic information from different pathogenic bacteria. The presence of several pathogenicity islands in the genome of different serotypes has lent credence to this theory.|$|E
40|$|Classical biotyping characterizes strains by {{creating}} biotype profiles that consider only {{positive and negative}} results for a predefined set of biochemical tests. This method allows Salmonella subspecies to be distinguished but does not allow serotypes and phage types to be distinguished. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the relatedness of isolates belonging to distinct Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotypes by using a refined biotyping process that considers the kinetics at which biochemical reactions take place. Using a Vitek GNI+ card for the identification of gram-negative organisms, we determined the biochemical kinetic reactions (28 biochemical tests) of 135 Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica strains of pig origin collected in Spain from 1997 to 2002 (59 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium strains, 25 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium monophasic variant strains, 25 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Anatum strains, 12 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Tilburg strains, 7 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Virchow strains, 6 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Choleraesuis strains, and 1 <b>Salmonella</b> enterica <b>serotype</b> 4, 5, 12 :−:− strain). The results were expressed as the colorimetric and turbidimetric changes (in percent) and were used to enhance the classical biotype profile by adding kinetic categories. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed by using the enhanced profiles and resulted in 14 clusters. Six major clusters grouped 94 % of all isolates with a similarity of ≥ 95 % within any given cluster, and eight clusters contained a single isolate. The six major clusters grouped not only serotypes of the same type but also phenotypic serotype variations into individual clusters. This suggests that metabolic kinetic reaction data from the biochemical tests commonly used for classic Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica biotyping can possibly be used to determine the relatedness between isolates in an easy and timely manner...|$|R
40|$|<b>Salmonella</b> enterica <b>serotype</b> Newport {{isolates}} {{resistant to}} at least nine antimicrobials (including extended-spectrum cephalosporins), known as serotype Newport MDR-AmpC isolates, have been rapidly emerging as pathogens in both animals and humans throughout the United States. Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is associated with clinical failures, including death, in patients with systemic infections. In this study, 87 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Newport strains were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing and examined {{for the presence of}} class 1 integrons and blaCMY genes. Thirty-five PFGE patterns were observed with XbaI, and three of these patterns were indistinguishable among isolates from humans and animals. Fifty-three (60 %) <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Newport isolates were identified as serotype Newport MDR-AmpC, including 16 (53 %) of 30 human isolates, 27 (93 %) of 29 cattle isolates, 7 (70 %) of 10 swine isolates, and 3 (30 %) of 10 chicken isolates. However, 28 (32 %) <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Newport isolates were susceptible to all 16 antimicrobials tested. The blaCMY gene was present in all serotype Newport MDR-AmpC isolates. Furthermore, the plasmid-mediated blaCMY gene was transferable via conjugation to an Escherichia coli strain. The transconjugant showed the MDR-AmpC resistance profile. Thirty-five (40 %) of the isolates possessed class 1 integrons. Sequence analyses of the integrons showed that they contained aadA, which confers resistance to streptomycin, or aadA and dhfr, which confer resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. One integron from a swine isolate contained the sat- 1 gene, which encodes resistance to streptothricin, an antimicrobial agent that has never been approved for use in the United States. In conclusion, <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Newport MDR-AmpC was commonly identified among <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Newport isolates recovered from humans and food animals.

A total of 139 Salmonella isolates were studied. <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> Enteritidis, Infantis, and Typhimurium included 84. 9 % of isolates, Enteritidis accounting for 41. 7 %. The most prevalent resistances were to doxycycline (64. 7 %), nalidixic acid (61. 2 %), tetracycline (51. 8 %), and streptomycin (42. 8 %). Fifty-three (38. 1 %) isolates contained class 1 integron. Eight different gene cassettes were identified, aadA 1 being the most frequently encountered.

The discrimination ability and epidemiological concordance of MLVA were {{compared with those of}} pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and phage typing. MLVA provided greater discrimination among non-epidemiologically linked isolates than did PFGE or phage typing. Epidemiologic concordance was evaluated by typing 40 isolates from four food-borne disease outbreaks. MLVA, PFGE, and, to a lesser extent, phage typing exhibited consistent subtypes within an outbreak. MLVA was better able to differentiate isolates between the individual outbreaks than either PFGE or phage typing. The reproducibility of MLVA was evaluated by subtyping sequential isolates from an infected individual and by testing isolates following multiple passages and freeze-thaw cycles. PFGE and MLVA patterns were reproducible for isolates that were frozen and passaged multiple times. However, 2 of 12 sequential isolates obtained from an individual over the course of 36 days had an MLVA type that differed at one locus and one isolate had a different phage type.

Methods and Results: A composting lab with reactors imitating centralized in-vessel composting systems was used. The elimination of indicator organisms was investigated at temperatures between 50 and 65 C. <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Senftenberg 775 W and thermotolerant coliforms were rapidly inactivated during less than one day at all tested temperatures. Enterococcus spp. showed a tail-shaped die-off and was not totally inactivated during the investigation. <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium phage 28 B showed an initial slower reduction at 50 and 55 C.

Conclusions: Aerated in-vessel composting at 55 C for five days gives a satisfying hygienization of faecal material from urine-diverting toilets. Inactivation of phage 28 B can be used as an indicator for inactivation of other similar thermoresistant microorganisms, inclusive viruses. Significance and Impact of Study: Analysis of inactivation of indigenous enterococci in combination with added <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium phage 28 B is an effective tool for evaluating the sanitizing effect when composting faecal material at thermophilic temperatures. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Enteritidis (SE) {{emerged as}} the most common <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> among {{infected}} persons in the United States during the 1980 s and 1990 s, with infections reaching a peak in 1995. During the past decade, farm-to-table control measures have been instituted in the United States, particularly in regions with the highest incidence of SE infection. We report trends {{in the incidence of}} SE in the 5 original surveillance areas of the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network during 1996 – 1999 : Minnesota, Oregon, and selected counties in California, Connecticut, and Georgia. Overall, the incidence of SE decreased 46 % from 1996 to 1999. The greatest decrease was in Connecticut (71 %), followed by northern California (50 %), Min-nesota (46 %), and Oregon (13 %). Although SE infection remains an important public health concern, there has been a remarkable decrease in its incidence. This decrease may be a result of targeted interventions, including on-farm control measures, refrigeration, and education efforts. In the United States, Salmonella infections are the sec-ond most common cause of bacterial foodborne illness, behind Campylobacter infections [1 – 3]. During 1994 – 1996, <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Enteritidis (SE) was the most frequently reported <b>serotype</b> of <b>Salmonella,</b> and it ac...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Salmonella infections cause {{gastrointestinal}} {{and systemic}} diseases worldwide {{and are the}} leading causes of food-borne illnesses in North America (1 - 4). <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> typhimurium (ST), in particular, is increasingly becoming a major public health concern because {{of its ability to}} acquire multiple resistant genes (5, 6) ...|$|R
40|$|Salmonellosis {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to the global public health burden. Salmonella enterica serotype Newport has ranked among three <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> most commonly associated with food-borne outbreaks in the United States. It was thought to be polyphyletic and composed of independent lineages. Here we report draft genomes of eight strains of S. Newport from diverse hosts and locations. Nontyphoid <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> cause approximately 1. 4 mil-lion illness cases (5) and several billion dollars in economic losses (7) annually in the United States. Salmonella enterica sero-type Newport ranks among the top three <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> associated with food-borne outbreaks in the United States (1). The number of S. Newport outbreaks has increased markedly since 1995, causing at least 100, 000 infections annually (1). Sangal et al. (6) indicated that S. Newport was polyphyletic and consisted of three independent lineages. Horizontal gene transfer has {{played a critical role in}} its evolution (6). Whole-genome sequencing has been increasingly used as a tool for both evolutionary studies and epidemiological investigations (2, 4). We selected eight S. New...|$|E
40|$|Infections with <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> are a {{major cause}} of food-borne {{diseases}} worldwide. Animal models other than the mouse have been employed for the study of nontyphoidal Salmonella infections because the murine model is not suitable for the study of Salmonellainduced diarrhea. The microbe has developed mechanisms to exploit the host cell machinery to its own purpose. Bacterial proteins delivered directly into the host cell cytosol cause cytoskeletal changes and interfere with host cell signaling pathways, which ultimately enhance disease manifestation. Recently, marked advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular interactions between <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> and their hosts. Here, we discuss the molecular basis of the pathogenesis of Salmonella-induced enteritis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> are a {{major cause}} of human {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. Over the past decades, a series of animal models have been developed to advance vaccine development, provide insights into immunity to infection, and study the pathogenesis of human Salmonella disease. The successive introduction of new animal models, each suited to interrogate previously neglected aspects of Salmonella disease, has ushered in important conceptual advances that continue to have a strong and sustained influence on the ideas driving research on <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes.</b> This article reviews important milestones in the use of animal models to study human Salmonella disease and identify research needs to guide future work...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Extended-spectrum {{beta-lactamase}} (ESBL) -producing <b>Salmonella</b> enterica <b>serotype</b> Isangi {{has emerged}} as a common <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> affecting mainly children in hospitals throughout South Africa. Between 2000 and 2002, 279 S. Isangi isolates from single infection episodes were referred from 21 hospitals in 5 provinces to the Enteric Diseases Reference Unit of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases of South Africa. All isolates were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing and three disk-diffusion methods confirmed ESBL-production in 273 isolates. PCR and nucleotide sequencing of 101 isolates identified TEM- 1 (2...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 595 faecal samples from {{raptorial}} birds, either captive or free-living, residing in GREFA Wildlife Hospital were bacteriologically examined using various selective media and an Automated Diagnostic Assay System for <b>Salmonella</b> detection. <b>Serotype</b> and phage type of the strains identified as Salmonella was determined. In the captive group, of the 285 samples examined, 21 (7. 36 %) were positive for <b>Salmonella.</b> <b>Serotyping</b> revealed {{that most of}} the individuals were infected by <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Havana. This result suggested {{that there could be a}} source of contamination in the Hospital although it could not be established. In the wild free-living group, over 310 samples examined (4. 19 %) were positive for Salmonella. The Salmonella isolates showed a major variety of serotypes: Enteritidis, Adelaide, Brandenburg, Newport, Typhimurium, Hadar, Saintpaul and Virchow. Most of them are similar to those commonly described in isolates from human and domestic animals. These results indicate that wild birds could be involved in the dissemination of Salmonella in humans or domestic animals or vice versa. This work has been supported by the FIS 0471 / 99.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{risk factors}} for sporadic <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Heidelberg diarrheal disease, we conducted a population-based case-control study in 5 Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) sur-veillance areas in 1996 – 1997. Forty-four case patients and 83 control subjects matched by age and telephone exchange were asked about exposures during the 5 -day period before onset of illness in the case patient. Risk factors for infection were evaluated using conditional logistic regression analysis. Eating eggs prepared outside the home remained the only significant risk factor for illness (matched odds ratio [MOR], 6. 0; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 2 – 29. 6). The population-attributable fraction of S. Heidelberg infections associated with eating eggs prepared outside the home was 37 %. Eliminating the risk associated with out-of-home egg consumption could substantially {{reduce the incidence of}} S. Heidelberg infections. Control measures to prevent S. Heidelberg infection should include advising consumers to avoid eating undercooked eggs and educating food handlers about proper egg handling and cooking. Each year an estimated 1. 4 million Salmonella infections and ∼ 600 related deaths occur in the United States [1]. <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Heidelberg is the third most com-monly reported infecting <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> in the United States, behind serotypes Typhimurium and En-teritidis.
