40|$|Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, {{commonly}} known as the GI Bill, was a transformative piece of legislation signed by President Roosevelt intended to help WWII Veterans transition successfully from <b>soldier</b> <b>to</b> <b>citizen.</b> Often dubbed the magic carpet to the middle class, provisions of the bill granted eligible veterans free college tuition, job training and placement, generous unemployment benefits and a low interest, no money down loan for a home or business. The effects of this bill were widespread; it touched eight out of ten men born in the 1920 's. Much is known of impact GI Bill benefits had on white veterans, but less is known of how black veterans, who accounted for one in thirteen WWII Veterans, were able to use them. This paper examines barriers black veterans faced to access and use the housing benefit, and examines the possible intergenerational impacts such barriers had on the wealth and homeownership status of African Americans today. by Cyd McKenna.

The houses of the {{settlement}} were submerged {{to the top of}} their roofs for nearly a month. The flood was the ultimate factor in the decision to relocate the settlement. When the French abandoned Twenty-Seven Mile Bluff, the fort and houses were burned. It is likely that the structures were destroyed to prevent enemies from easily establishing a fortification at the site.|$|R

The Persian shah, Khosrau I (r. 531-579), demanded the surrender of Peranius on the grounds that Peranius was his hereditary slave.

40|$|In post-Cold War West Africa, an {{environment}} has emerged that has proven {{conducive to the}} supply and recycling of arms and combatants. The collections of arms, and a sustainable demobilisation and reintegration of ex-combatants, are central challenges faced by many war-torn countries in the region. The {{point of departure for}} this study is Sierra Leone, which {{is in the process of}} recovery after a devastating eleven-year-long civil war. The focus is on the strategies to facilitate the process of converting <b>soldiers</b> <b>to</b> <b>citizens</b> in Sierra Leone, in light of the regional security dynamics. The study builds on an integrated approach to security in that it acknowledges the interconnectedness of national, regional and individual security. It takes into account the interplay between these levels both when trying to capture central aspects of the regional security dynamics in West Africa, and by recognising the importance of interaction between levels in peace-building processes. The theoretical framework includes conceptualisations of the African state - regionalism, regionalisation and related concepts - as well as theories on regional security. The Sierra Leone Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) programme serves as a case for studying efforts of national post-war recovery in a regionalised security environment. Three research questions are addressed in order to illuminate the programme s adequacy in this respect. The main interest is whether the regional dimension of the flow of arms and combatants is reflected in the measures to combat and prevent it. In addition to searching for active responses to the regional security dynamics, potential impacts of national achievements, or lack of such, are taken into account. Although a DDR programme with a national focus has the potential to contribute to sustainable demobilisation in the region as a whole, the study concludes that regional measures are still required as characteristics of the security environment make a national focus insufficient. The study presents various ways in which a regional approach to DDR can be taken. On the basis of the information presented, the Sierra Leone DDR programme cannot be said to have responded to the regionalised security environment in which the country is embedded. To a high extent this is due to the fact that a proper response requires interaction on these matters across borders and between various levels. Problems and potentials related to this in the West African region are addressed throughout the study...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} how the educational rituals changed over the time from the Ottoman Empire to the Republic of Turkey. This study confines Turkish educational rituals to the rituals Goffman (1967) conceptualized as interaction rituals. Interaction rituals are micro daily events and behaviours, including gestures and facial expressions, clothes and symbols, that safeguard the definition and the holiness of the authority, and therefore act as the differentiator. This paper reveals that as education was modernized and institutionalized in Turkey, the relationship between the student and the teacher became more distant. The hierarchical gap between the student and the teacher became more visible through educational interaction rituals, and the role of the teacher changed within the Republic, from religious authority <b>to</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>citizen...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Scars We Carve': Disruptive Bodies in Civil War Literature" {{examines}} {{the presence of}} physical forms, marks, and scars in periodical literature produced during and shortly after the war in order to illuminate the ubiquity and significance of bodies in the literary record of the war. Presenting substantial archival evidence of how American civilians and combatants interacted with and represented the physical effects of war, this dissertation focuses especially on the disruptive bodies of injured and maimed combatants, African American soldiers, and war-torn women. The critical consensus on Civil War literature emphasizes the effacement of the individual in sentimental narratives of nationhood, sacrifice, and reconciliation. This study refutes and complicates such readings by demonstrating the rhetorical and discursive power of bodies touched and shaped by war. Though sentimentality did persist and many writers continued to write about war deaths {{in the same way}} they wrote about non-war deaths, a large number of Americans resisted reintegrative, reconciliatory, and apologist narratives, underscoring instead the effects of the war on individuals. The destruction and upheaval of war disrupted and complicated traditional ways of understanding and depicting death and wounding; in many texts created during the war, soldiers' bodies refuse to rest quietly beneath the sod and missing limbs talk and tell of horror and suffering. The first chapter documents the ubiquity of female personifications of the Union and the Confederacy, examining the ways in which gender and nationality interact and intersect to assert that symbolic femininity is central to both sides' understandings of the conflict and its stakes. The second chapter proposes a new way of reading Whitman's Civil War poetry and prose, asserting that the bodies of dead and dying soldiers fill his pages, refusing to be ignored, silenced, or reintegrated into sentimental and reconciliatory conceptions of death and decay. The bodies of African American soldiers, the subject of the third chapter, disrupt and reject antebellum stereotypes of powerless slave bodies. Beginning with an analysis of literary and artistic depictions of slaves published during {{the first years of the}} war, the chapter traces the development of black men from slaves <b>to</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>to</b> <b>citizens</b> in popular literature and visual culture. The left-handed penmanship contest that forms the focus of the final chapter also provides tangible evidence of the effects of war. Reading contest entries produced by amputees in conjunction with periodical poetry and prose focusing on amputation and its ramifications, this chapter underscores the centrality of the marked and maimed <b>soldier</b> body <b>to</b> the way in which soldiers and non-combatants understood and wrote about military service. "The Scars We Carve" brings to light a significant body of Civil War literature that disrupts or rejects narratives of reconciliation and records the horrors of war. In numerous poems and stories of the war, the individual body and its component parts, marked by violence or imbued with rhetorical power, testify to the "great evil" of war, the issues at stake in the conflict, and its lasting influence...|$|R

As the war progressed, Mauldin’s Willie and Joe cartoons increased in notoriety and as a result Stars and Stripes newspaper instructed Mauldin with covering the war through cartoons. Mauldin eventually worked for Stars and Stripes, received his own vehicle to traverse the battlefield and gain material for his comics.
