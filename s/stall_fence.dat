50|$|The Encore's {{standard}} equipment list have been increased and many {{systems have been}} upgraded. Bleed air is used to anti-ice the wing leading edge, and several boundary layer energizers, plus a <b>stall</b> <b>fence,</b> {{have been added to}} the wing to improve stall characteristics. A digital pressurization controller reduces pilot workload and an improved wheel brake system offers better modulation. Redesigned interior fittings and passenger seats provide more seated headroom. New passenger service units provide more even airflow and temperature control.The Encore's MTOW is bumped 330 pounds to 16,630 pounds, enabling it to carry five passengers with full fuel. The additional weight increases takeoff field length to 3,561 feet, compared with 3,180 feet for the Ultra. The much improved high altitude thrust output of the PW535 engines, however, allow the Encore to climb faster and cruise higher. Its maximum cruise altitude is FL 450.|$|E

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} welded steel tubing, with its flying surfaces covered in doped aircraft fabric. Its 30.6 ft span wing mounts flaps, leading edge slats, drooping ailerons, <b>stall</b> <b>fences,</b> winglets and has a wing area of 130.6 sq ft. It employs a NACA 4415 airfoil. The acceptable power range is [...] and the standard engines used are the [...] Continental IO-240 and [...] Continental O-200 powerplants.|$|R
5|$|In 1953, Tank {{constructed}} a fourth prototype (No. 04) and, {{in an attempt}} to resolve the design's deep stall problems at high angles of attack, added <b>stall</b> <b>fences</b> on each wing and four strakes on the rear fuselage. Other refinements included a pressurized cockpit, additional fuel capacity and it was also the first prototype to be fitted with the definitive four 20mm Hispano Mark V cannon armament. Lt. Jorge Doyle piloted the fourth IAe 33 on its maiden flight on 20 August 1953 and, along with Lt. Gonzalez and Lt. Balado, began armament testing in 1954.|$|R

"Have a care, my Colet," [...] {{answered}} the yellow bearded foreigner; [...] "thou art already in ill odour with those same men in authority; and though a Dean's <b>stall</b> be <b>fenced</b> from the episcopal crook, {{yet there is}} a rod at Rome which can reach even thither." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Lansen {{was produced}} with a sleek, streamlined airframe with clean lines. The Lansen {{was the first}} aircraft on which every mould line had been a result of mathematical calculation, made possible via an early application of computer technology. The wing had a 10 per cent laminar profile and a 35° sweep. hydraulically-boosted ailerons and large Fowler flaps on the wings comprised the main flight control surfaces, as did the hydraulically-assisted elevators of the powered tailplane; {{a total of four}} airbrakes were also present {{on the sides of the}} rear fuselage. The Lansen had a tricycle undercarriage with a single wheel on all of the landing gear. Other wing features include one-section <b>stall</b> <b>fences</b> on the outer-thirds of the wing, a pitot tube on the right wingtip, and three underwing hardpoints. To test the 35° sweepback design of the Lansen's wing, a half-scale wing was mounted on a Saab Safir, designated Saab 202 Safir.|$|R
50|$|Extensive cattle yards are {{contained}} in 8 sections which include over 100 cattle <b>stall</b> partitions. <b>Fence</b> post are former rail track sections with a top plate and middle rails of steel piping, with welded infill of galvanised reinforcing mesh. Each stall is serviced by a water trough with water reticulated from a raised central water system with intermittent taps. Six aisles allow pedestrian inspection of the yards and each aisle has a concrete pavement with a square paved pattern and laid to a fall. Several shade trees {{are present in the}} cattle yard area. All trees are introduced species.|$|R
50|$|Cribbing, or crib biting, {{involves}} a horse grasping a solid object {{such as the}} <b>stall</b> door or <b>fence</b> rail with its incisor teeth, arching its neck, and contracting the lower neck muscles to retract the larynx caudally. This movement is coincided with an in-rush of air through the crico-pharynx into the oesophagus producing the characteristic cribbing sound or grunt. Usually, air is not swallowed but returns to the pharynx. It {{is considered to be}} an abnormal, compulsive behavior or stereotypy, and often labelled as a stable vice.|$|R
500|$|Between 1998 and 1999 a {{renovation}} {{that was}} [...] "one {{of the most}} extensive changes in the homestead's history" [...] set out to [...] "restore the grounds around the house to exactly {{the way it was}} when Priestley lived" [...] there. This involved reconstructing exact replicas of the original carriage barn, hog sties, horse <b>stalls,</b> gardens, <b>fences,</b> and even the privy. These structures were based on T. Lambourne's drawings of the house and grounds that had been discovered in 1983, other records, and excavations. [...] Priestley left no written description of his laboratory, but much is known of his experiments and late-18th-century laboratories. Extensive research on the laboratory within the house was completed in 1996, including excavations that revealed two underground ovens, as well as evidence of a primitive fume hood. The 1998 renovations also included work to restore the laboratory to a condition as close to its original state as possible.|$|R

This coincides with an in-rush of air into the oesophagus producing the characteristic cribbing grunt. Usually, air is not swallowed but returns to the pharynx. Wind-sucking is a related behavior whereby the horse arches its neck and sucks air into the windpipe but does so without grasping an object. [...] Wind-sucking is thought to form part of the mechanism of cribbing, rather than being defined as an entirely separate behavior.|$|R
2500|$|The 1954 Pageant of Peace {{was held}} on December 17, 1954. The Ellipse became {{the site of the}} National Community Christmas Tree, and cut trees were used because Park Service {{officials}} felt that a living tree would interfere with the various cultural and recreational events on the Ellipse at other times of the year. The [...] "pageant of peace" [...] theme was intended to echo the words of the angels ("Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men") during the Annunciation to the shepherds as found in the Authorized King James Version of the New Testament. Most of the goods and services which made the event possible were donated: [...] Local architect Leon Chatelain, Jr., designed the site; Michigan State College provided the tree; the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Norfolk Southern Railway gave the transportation to get the tree to D.C.; Pepco supplied the Christmas lights and power; Hargrove Display Decorators provided the nativity scene; the peace symbols, plaques, and trees for the [...] "Pathway of Peace" [...] were given by 27 U.S. states and territories and 23 embassies; and the reindeer <b>stalls,</b> metal <b>fencing,</b> stage, and wooden walkways were provided by the National Park Service.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether dairy cows visit and interact with a fenceline-housed bull more during oestrus than outside oestrus and whether fenceline bull contact affects expression of oestrus. At one end of a free <b>stall</b> a <b>fence</b> with vertical open bars was placed behind which a bull could be housed, allowing interactions with the cows. A closed fence with two blinded entrances was placed before the fence, creating a contact area. The experiment consisted of three treatments; it started with the control treatment (no bull on the farm) and was followed by bull treatment (a bull housed behind the fence) and no bull treatment (a bull present on the farm but not housed behind the fence). Signs of oestrus were observed every 4 h for 30 min and cows were equipped with pedometers. On the day of oestrus, cows were more frequent in the contact area during the bull treatment (12. 0 ± 9. 8 times) and the no bull treatment (13. 9 ± 10. 2 times) than during the control treatment (2. 6 ± 2. 5 times). The frequency of visits to the contact area was low and not different between treatments on the other days (2. 2 ± 1. 9 times). More cows had direct contact with the bull on the day of oestrus (71. 4 %) compared to the days outside oestrus (21. 4 ¿ 30 %). The duration of direct contact with the bull was highly variable between cows and did not differ between oestrus and non-oestrus days. Behaviour and duration of oestrus were not affected by treatment but the relative increase in number of steps during oestrus tended to be higher in the bull (5. 5 ± 0. 2) and no bull treatment (5. 3 ± 0. 3) than in the control treatment (4. 6 ± 0. 3). In conclusion, dairy cows in oestrus seem to be attracted by a bull or by the expectation of the presence of a bull, but fenceline bull exposure does not affect behavioural expression of oestrus...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the various}} memory {{consistency}} models, the sequen-tial consistency (SC) model, in which memory operations ap-pear {{to take place}} in the order specified by the program, is the most intuitive and enables programmers to reason about their parallel programs the best. Nevertheless, processor de-signers often choose to support relaxed memory consistency models because the weaker ordering constraints imposed by such models allow for more instructions to be reordered and enable higher performance. Programs running on machines supporting weaker consistency models, can be transformed into ones in which SC is enforced. The compiler does this by computing a minimal set of memory access pairs whose ordering automatically guarantees SC. To ensure that these memory access pairs are not reordered, memory fences are inserted. Unfortunately, insertion of such memory fences can significantly slowdown the program. We observe that the ordering of the minimal set of mem-ory accesses that the compiler strives to enforce, is typically already enforced in the normal course of program execution. A study we conducted on programs with compiler inserted memory fences shows that only 8 % of the executed instances of the memory fences are really necessary to ensure SC. Motivated by this study we propose the conditional fence mechanism (C-Fence) that utilizes compiler information to decide dynamically if {{there is a need to}} <b>stall</b> at each <b>fence.</b> Our experiments with SPLASH- 2 benchmarks show that, with C-Fences, programs can be transformed to enforce SC incurring only 12 % slowdown, as opposed to 43 % slowdown using normal fence instructions. Our approach requires very little hardware support (< 300 bytes of on-chip-storage) and it avoids the use of speculation and its associated costs...|$|R
