The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi associated with Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium can grow in metalliferous soils containing copper.

A {{sample of the}} fungus Aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc.

25|$|Mayonnaise {{emulsions}} eventually break as the oil droplets coalesce, {{although the}} kinetics and the precise {{mechanisms by which}} the droplets coalesce are not fully understood. As samples of mayonnaise age, the size distribution of the oil droplets changed to produce fewer, larger droplets which eventually led to separation of the phases of the mayonnaise. The shift in droplet size could be measured either microscopically (through light or scanning electron micrographs) or by {{a decrease in the}} absorbance at 500nm. When mayonnaise is stored at elevated temperatures, increases in Brownian motion of the droplets, decrease in the viscosity of the continuous phase, and <b>solubilization</b> of the surfactants all contribute to the breakdown of the emulsion.|$|E
25|$|Secondary vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{is associated}} with chronic malabsorption of lipids, impaired bile production and release, and chronic exposure to oxidants, such as cigarette smoke, and chronic alcoholism. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin and depends on micellar <b>solubilization</b> for dispersion into the small intestine, which results in poor use of vitamin A from low-fat diets. Zinc deficiency can also impair absorption, transport, and metabolism of vitamin A because {{it is essential for}} the synthesis of the vitamin A transport proteins and as the cofactor in conversion of retinol to retinal. In malnourished populations, common low intakes of vitamin A and zinc increase the severity of vitamin A deficiency and lead physiological signs and symptoms of deficiency. A study in Burkina Faso showed major reduction of malaria morbidity with combined vitamin A and zinc supplementation in young children.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{substances}} dissolve congruently; i.e., {{the composition}} of the solid and the dissolved solute stoichiometrically match. However, some substances may dissolve incongruently, whereby {{the composition of}} the solute in solution does not match that of the solid. This <b>solubilization</b> is accompanied by alteration of the [...] "primary solid" [...] and possibly formation of a secondary solid phase.

2500|$|Dissolution is {{not always}} an {{instantaneous}} process. It is fast when salt and sugar dissolve in water but much slower for a tablet of aspirin or a large crystal of hydrated copper(II) sulfate. [...] These observations are the consequence of two factors: the rate of <b>solubilization</b> (in kg/s) {{is related to the}} solubility product (dependent on temperature) and the surface area of the material. [...] The speed at which a solid dissolves may depend on its crystallinity or lack thereof in the case of amorphous solids and the surface area (crystallite size) and the presence of polymorphism. Many practical systems illustrate this effect, for example in designing methods for controlled drug delivery. Critically, the dissolution rate may depend on the presence of mixing and other factors that determine the degree of undersaturation in the liquid solvent film immediately adjacent to the solid solute crystal. In some cases, solubility equilibria can {{take a long time to}} establish (hours, days, months, or many years; depending on the nature of the solute and other factors). In practice, it means that the amount of solute in a solution is not purely determined by its thermodynamic solubility, but also depends on kinetics of dissolution (or precipitation).|$|E
