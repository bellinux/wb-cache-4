5|$|Charles Diehl {{regarded}} early 7th-century Byzantine Africa to {{have undergone}} {{an economic and}} demographic decline, being under constant threat by hostile Berbers. Later historians, however, have had to revise this picture in light of archaeological evidence: the Exarchate {{was among the most}} affluent areas of the Byzantine Empire, though of lesser wealth and significance than Egypt. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seen much less warfare than the Balkans, Mesopotamia and the Caucasus did in that era, thus allowing its residents a safer way of life. There is evidence of ongoing trade between Byzantine Africa and Frankish Gaul during the 7th century. Agriculture was thriving, particularly {{in the vicinity of the}} Medjerda River. The production of grain, olive oil and wine kept the local population well-fed and probably supplied their maritime trade. Fishing <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been another thriving field. The local elite <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> invested in the building of churches. The main testaments to their existence and activities are examples of funerary art, particularly mosaics. Heraclius the Elder <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> established ties with this elite. His son, Heraclius the Younger, married his first wife Eudokia during the 7th century. Her father was Rogas, a landowner in the Exarchate.|$|E
5|$|Henry <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been known}} in {{northern}} Germany, {{but he was}} largely ignored elsewhere in the Roman Catholic world.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius the Elder <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been {{replaced}} by Suren. His service in Armenia was brief, but arguably reinforced his ties to the country.|$|E
5000|$|Fantasy {{life and}} real life cannot be distinguished. Real occurrences <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been {{imagined}} and fantasy thoughts <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> actually happened.|$|R

60|$|The {{shadow of}} {{impending}} disaster <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{found its way}} into Phipps' bones. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lost alike his courage and his dignity.|$|R
5|$|The {{bones of}} sheep were found, but there <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been little {{spinning}} and weaving.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{tired of}} {{politics}} at this point. In AD22, he shared his tribunician authority {{with his son}} Drusus, and began making yearly excursions to Campania that reportedly became longer and longer every year. In AD23, Drusus mysteriously died, and Tiberius <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{made no effort to}} elevate a replacement. Finally, in AD26, Tiberius retired from Rome altogether to the island of Capri.|$|E
5|$|Details {{about the}} {{religious}} life in Qatna {{are not available}} due to the rarity of written evidence from the city; in general, many cults <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> existed and mixed in Qatna, most prominently the royal ancestor cult, the cult of gods and {{the cult of the}} dead.|$|E
50|$|New Kingdom {{contacts}} (everywhere except Greece) <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been dominated}} by military activities. Strong northerly contacts with Crete, Mycenea and the Helladic (on the Aegean islands) <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> persisted during this time. Southward, Egypt conquered Nubia.|$|R
60|$|In the hansom they {{presently}} picked up, {{the robust}} anarchist became explanatory. He was still awfully pale, with eyes that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sunk a whole half-inch into his tense face. But he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> thought of everything with extraordinary method.|$|R
50|$|None <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been printed.|$|R
5|$|Dimorphodon {{has been}} envisioned as a puffin {{analogue}} in the past, but its jaw structure and gait, combined with its poor flight capabilities, {{indicate that it}} was a terrestrial/semiarboreal feeder. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a predator of small mammals and squamates, and possibly also preyed on large insects.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan went to Rome in 960, and {{received}} the pallium from Pope John XII. On his journey there, Dunstan's acts of charity were so lavish as to leave nothing {{for himself and his}} attendants. His steward complained, but Dunstan <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> suggested that they trust in Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{have been}} made at the Dinas Powys hillfort in Glamorgan of what <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been the court of an {{important}} ruler in the 5th and 6th centuries A.D.|$|E
50|$|All the {{families}} from {{the communities of}} Malpec, Tracadie and Étang des Berges <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> evaded the deportation {{as well as a}} number of families settled on the rivière du Nord-Est who <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> gone <b>to</b> Ristigouche with the Gauthiers, Bujolds and Haché-Gallants.|$|R
50|$|Nawrahta <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{paid tribute}} <b>to</b> Naresuan's {{successor}} Ekathotsarot. The feared invasion from Burma did not come. In all, Lan Na {{during his last}} years from May 1603 onward <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been relatively peaceful even if the specter of war was ever present.|$|R
60|$|He sat like a {{man turned}} to stone. Some part of the stiff vigour of the man <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> subsided. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{shrunken}} in his seat. His eyes were fixed upon her face, but he opened his lips twice before he spoke.|$|R
5|$|Gebeachan (died 937), {{also known}} as Gébennach, and Gebechán, was a tenth-century King of the Isles. He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a {{subordinate}} to Amlaíb mac Gofraid, King of Dublin, and is recorded to have fought and died at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 it was {{announced}} that NBM Publishing were going to reissue the four English language albums published by Dargaud-USA and also release a translation of Empire of a Thousand Planets but nothing <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> come of this.|$|E
5|$|In particular, Mendelssohn <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{regarded}} Paris and {{its music}} {{with the greatest}} of suspicion and an almost puritanical distaste. Attempts made during his visit there to interest him in Saint-Simonianism ended in embarrassing scenes.|$|E
25|$|Gateshead, Jarrow and Tynemouth had {{boundary}} changes, this is {{why they}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had such large population increases.|$|R
5000|$|Tenor cornetts <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{come in two}} {{varieties}} - {{small bore}} and large bore. The smaller bored instruments <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been [...] "scaled up" [...] cornetts, true alto or tenor cornetts. However, a number of instruments with a larger bore have survived and these instruments <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had a sound somewhat reminiscent of the serpent. The timbre of the small bore tenor cornetti is more [...] "focused" [...] and incisive than that of their large bore counterparts. Some modern cornett makers, like Christopher Monk, for instance, have made both varieties of tenor cornett available to customers.|$|R
50|$|Very few <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been made.|$|R
5|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been built}} on older foundations. The main {{improvement}} made by the Portuguese was to construct a gun deck looking over the harbor.|$|E
5|$|John P. Ryan as Buzz Bronski; a crime {{boss who}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{had a brief}} {{partnership}} with Chuckie Sol. He is later killed by the Phantasm at the cemetery while visiting Sol's grave.|$|E
5|$|Maximus {{continues}} to be the guard's greatest steed in arresting criminals in all of Corona. He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> feelings for a female horse named Fidel.|$|E
50|$|Kyle also <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a small {{friendship}} with John Sampson, Alex's childhood friend and partner. However, {{by the time}} Kyle is revealed to be the killer, John <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> view him as an enemy and whatever friendship existed between them faded away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because Lord Drummond always <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more on hand than {{he knows}} how to get through, and you never <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> do." ...|$|R
50|$|While all {{of these}} people <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the motive for {{plotting}} against Caesar, few <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the inclination (for instance, Antony seems more interested in spending his days in debauchery, and Cicero is slavishly devoted to his new young wife, Publilia) and those that do (such as Vercingetorix and Arsinoe) <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> lack opportunity.|$|R
5|$|Monte Testaccio's {{use as an}} amphora dump <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> ceased {{after about}} the 260s, perhaps due to the city's quays being moved elsewhere. A new type of amphora was also {{introduced}} around this time to transport olive oil.|$|E
5|$|Mourning : Trojan and, especially, Troilus' own family's {{mourning}} at {{his death}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> epitomised grief {{at the loss of}} a child in classical civilization. Horace, Callimachus and Cicero all refer to Troilus in this way.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the large}} Chian navy <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> stood their ground, perhaps {{accompanied}} by a few other ships. They fought valiantly, but had huge casualties. Eventually the remaining Chian ships sailed away back to Chios, thereby ending the battle.|$|E
50|$|Reviews <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been {{generally}} positive. e.g.|$|R
60|$|She <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{know her}} way, and she <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a {{quantity}} of luggage.|$|R
5000|$|Due to its {{proximity}} with China, Japan {{had long been}} familiar with gunpowder weaponry. Firearms <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> first appeared in Japan around 1270, as primitive metal tubes invented in China and called teppō (鉄砲 lit. [...] "iron cannon") <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been introduced in Japan as well.|$|R
