5|$|Major {{changes to}} the {{original}} Verdeja 1 included removing the turret {{and replacing it with}} a gun shield with 10millimetre thick steel armor. This meant that much of the chassis' roof and rear wall was eliminated. The howitzer was designed as a monoblock steel tube, using a double-baffle muzzle brake, with twelve twists completing a full turn every forty calibers. As mounted, the howitzer could fire between 0.5° and 25°, and move 4.5° either left or right. The crew could stow eight rounds of ammunition in a ready-round <b>stowage</b> <b>area</b> near the walls of the gun shield {{on each side of the}} breech, allowing easy access to projectiles. Otherwise, the vehicle could store another 24 rounds in an auxiliary carriage. The carriage was based on the axles and wheels of a PaK 36 anti-tank gun. A unique feature of this prototype was a mechanical brake built into the idler-wheel to the rear of the chassis, guaranteeing the vehicle's stability when firing and avoiding damage to the transmission.|$|E
25|$|The Katana {{provides}} excellent {{external visibility}} to its pilots via {{the use of}} an one-piece bubble canopy, which its hinged at the rear, enabling easy entry using the built-in steps. The cockpit features a comprehensive six-unit instrumentation panel on the left-hand side, the majority of avionics-related controls and displays {{in the center of the}} console, and engine-specific elements are allocated to the right-hand panel. The Katana makes use of individual stick-type flight control, as opposed to yokes, along with key engine controls on a centrally-positioned pedestal. There has been positive reports on the aircraft's comfort, the crew accommodated on fixed-position reclined seats with a small personal <b>stowage</b> <b>area</b> located directly behind; the noise levels are so low that headsets are typically unnecessary for voice communication, although an intercom system is integrated for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|The main {{addition}} to the Series 200, which was introduced in April 1968, was the extended nose, which, together with a reconfigured storage compartment in the rear cabin, greatly increased baggage <b>stowage</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early the {{following}} morning, the destroyer suffered {{a series of}} shattering internal explosions. By 06:50, she took on a 16° starboard list; and explosions, mostly in the ammunition <b>stowage</b> <b>areas,</b> continued to stagger the stricken destroyer. Then, at about 07:50, a singularly violent explosion caused her to capsize and sink. The tip of her bow remained above water until about 08:27 when she disappeared completely taking with her 15 officers and 123 men.|$|R
5000|$|The Foudre class carry large <b>stowage</b> <b>areas</b> {{which can}} be used to ferry battle tanks and vehicles, a 52-ton {{elevating}} platform, a lateral ramp and a flight deck able to simultaneously operate several helicopters.Three rotations of such ships can ferry a whole armoured regiment with its 22 AMX-30 or Leclerc battle tanks, 44 AMX 10 RC heavy armoured cars, 22 véhicules de l'Avant Blindé, 41 all-terrain light vehicles (including 16 MILAN anti-tank missile systems), 54 TRM 4000 trucks, 15 TRM 2000 light trucks, 5 fuel trucks, 2 tug trucks, 6 120 mm mortars, 67 towed containers and one beach carpeting system, overall 3300 tonnes.|$|R
25|$|Interior design {{improvements}} {{were another}} {{main focus of}} the LRX concept though {{the interior of the}} production Evoque changed significantly from the concept LRX. Notable interior features in the LRX included ambient interior lighting that changed according to Terrain Response settings, and vehicle data which was presented to the driver through a ‘floating’ three-dimensional LCD display. An aluminium centre console with an iPhone docking station stretched the length of the cabin, separating the four seats and the tailgate. Seats with open frameworks were used to give the impression of an airy interior while also creating useful under-seat and under-floor <b>stowage</b> <b>areas.</b> Electric motors folded the rear seats forward providing enough room for two mountain bikes to be fitted upright, with front wheels removed and stored in dedicated slots in the floor.|$|R
50|$|The Saxon's hull is {{welded steel}} with a V-shaped under-chassis plate to deflect mine detonations. Seating is {{provided}} in the rear for up to ten troops, although eight is a more comfortable load if all their equipment is included. There is an equipment <b>stowage</b> <b>area</b> on the hull roof.|$|E
5000|$|Level Three was {{to house}} an {{exercise}} {{area with a}} treadmill and stationary bicycle. The design also contained a complete health care system with all types of medical and emergency equipment and a type of [...] "space bath" [...] area provided for body cleansing. In addition, this level contained a soft <b>stowage</b> <b>area</b> identical to level one.|$|E
5000|$|Payload bay {{configuration}} included Orbiter Docking System in forward {{area and}} SPACEHAB single module toward the aft. STS-76 marked first flight of SPACEHAB pressurized module to support Shuttle-Mir dockings; single module primarily served as <b>stowage</b> <b>area</b> for large supply of equipment slated {{for transfer to}} space station, but also carried European Space Agency’s Biorack experiment rack for on-orbit research.|$|E
40|$|The {{designing}} of Space Shuttle modules {{and equipment}} {{in order to}} provide a stimulating and efficient work atmosphere and a pleasant living environment is examined. The habitation module for the eight crew members is divided into four areas: ceiling, floor, port, and starboard. The module is to consist of crew quarters, a wardroom, a galley, a personal hygiene facility, a health maintenance facility, and <b>stowage</b> <b>areas.</b> There is a correlation between the function of the module and its location; for example the galley will be near the wardroom and the personal hygiene facility near the crew quarters. The designs of the equipment for crew accommodation and of the equipment to be maintained and repaired by the crew will be standarized. The design and functions of the crew and equipment restraints, crew mobility aids, racks to contain equipment, and functional units are described...|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the Baba contains a lot of custom teak work. Some versions of the boat have the entire interior staved with teak. The cabin sole is made from teak planking separated with holly strips. It has a very spacious-feeling 6'4" [...] of headroom.Sleeping berths consist of a spacious V berth with good storage below {{and access to the}} chain locker via louvred doors, a full length berth in the main cabin {{on either side of the}} boat and on many models, a quarter berth on the aft starboard quarter, however in some models this was replaced by extra stowage.A small galley is built on the port aft side and opposite is a spacious chart table. Forward on the starboard side are the heads.The engine is mounted below the cabin companionway and is boxed in with a substantial teak housing. There are lockers and <b>stowage</b> <b>areas</b> all over the boat.The Baba 30 typically came with two separate water tanks which reside under the port and starboard berths, each holding about 100 ltrs (25 US Gal). However many variants of this tankage have been discovered on different Babas.|$|R
5000|$|On 8 November, Pensacola sailed from Pearl Harbor in {{the screen}} of Southern Attack Force {{aircraft}} carriers. On 19 November, Pensacola made bombardment runs on Betio and Tarawa. She rained 600 projectiles to put coast defense guns out of action, and destroyed enemy beach defenses and numerous buildings. As troops stormed ashore on Tarawa on 20 November, the cruiser screened carriers launching air strikes supporting the landings. That night, she fought off Japanese torpedo bombers and assisted [...] into Funafuti, Ellice Islands. For the next two months, she ranged out of that base to screen carriers covering the movement of reinforcements and supplies to the Gilberts. On 29 January 1944, she began strikes and bombardments to destroy Japanese air power and shipping in the Marshall Islands. That night, Pensacola helped bombard Tarao in the Eastern Marshalls. She then slammed shells into airfield runways, seaplane ramps, ammunition <b>stowage</b> <b>areas</b> and buildings on Wotje. She continued pounding these targets as Marines and Army troops landed on 31 January to seize Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls. The invasion of the Marshall Islands continued on 1 February as Marines occupied Roi and Namur Islands. Pensacola continued to hit hard at Tarao, Maloelap Atoll through 18 February, destroying coastal defenses and air bases of the enemy in the eastern Marshalls. Operating from Majuro and Kwajalein, she continued to patrol in approaches of the Marshalls. She again served {{in the screen}} of fast carriers conducting raids in the Caroline Islands (30 March-1 April), against Japanese defenses at Palau, Yap, Ulithi and Woleai.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} renovation {{involved the}} removal of the shop from coach D and the conversion of the <b>stowage</b> <b>area</b> in coach F to a catering storage area where there is now a fridge, food storage and a space for an on-board trolley to be stored. Bicycle storage has been moved to coach D where the shop was. It can now store three bicycles instead of four.|$|E

50|$|Late in 1959, Zellars {{entered the}} Norfolk Naval Shipyard and began Mark II Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) {{overhaul}} and alterations. The addition of more up-to-date equipment added years to her projected service life and greatly enhanced her ASW capability. The most noticeable change was {{the addition of}} a flight deck and <b>stowage</b> <b>area</b> for an ASW helicopter. These modifications were completed in June 1960; and the ship moved south to a new home port, Mayport, Florida. Between June 1960 and December 1965, Zellars made five deployments to European waters. Four of those assignments consisted of duty in the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet and the remaining one involved a midshipman summer cruise to northern European ports. Her duties with the 2nd Fleet in the western Atlantic and Caribbean consisted for the most part of training and yard overhauls but were highlighted by participation in operations enforcing the Cuban quarantine in the fall of 1962 and occasional duty supporting the Polaris missile test program.|$|E
5000|$|Stowage Cabin - The cuddy on SCAMP serves many purposes. The {{overhanging}} cabin top {{acts like}} a dodger and is large enough for an adult to sit athwartships out of the weather. Additionally, items in forward lockers can be accessed without water getting into storage <b>area.</b> <b>Stowage</b> cabin also houses a mast box that supports more of the mast than is possible with open boats. This in turn allows for an unstayed mast.|$|R

5000|$|On 21 March, the {{destroyer}} resumed station off Vietnam. This time, however, {{off the coast}} of North Vietnam. Instead of supporting American and South Vietnamese troops directly through shore bombardments, she did so by interdicting enemy logistical efforts in Operation [...] "Sea Dragon". Though primarily directed at the enemys water-borne logistics, [...] "Sea Dragon" [...] also struck wherever possible at the enemys overland supply lines. During her 26 days on station engaged in [...] "Sea Dragon" [...] operations, Turner Joy fired on a number of shore targets in addition to an even larger number of enemy waterborne logistics craft. On 7 April, while firing on some enemy craft beached near Cap Mui Ron, {{the destroyer}} came under the fire of a North Vietnamese shore battery. During that exchange, she suffered a direct hit on the fantail and a near-miss air burst above the forward mast. The hit astern penetrated the deck to the supply office, damaging records therein as well as pipes and cables in the overhead. Several rounds of 5 inch VT fragmentation projectiles in mount 53 ammunition <b>stowage</b> <b>area</b> also suffered damage and had to be discarded. Shrapnel from near misses wounded a member of Turner Joys repair party and peppered her bow while the air burst above the forward mast put her air-search radar out of service except for its IFF aspect. The damage, however, was not severe enough to curtail her tour of duty; and she remained on station until relieved by HMAS Hobart on 16 April.|$|E
40|$|Habitability is {{one aspect}} of long-duration {{missions}} that becomes more impor-tant as the mission length increases. The impact of a poorly designed switch or lack of <b>stowage</b> <b>area</b> is different for a mission of six months compared to a mission of one week. With habitability and human factors studies which {{took place during the}} early phases of the Lunar-Mars Life Support Test Project (LMLSTP), each subsequent phase built on the previous, and the final designs were improved based on what was learned. Information concerning habitability issues was solicited from crewmembers dur-ing LMLSTP Phases IIa and III. One format used to obtain information was the Space Operations Issues Reporting Tool, or SOIRT. A second was a “habitability issues ” questionnaire containing 59 questions used to rate the acceptability of different habitability categories on a Likert scale, from 1 to 7. Shortly before each crew completed its mission, a debrief was held with each member individually. The completed questionnaire was used to address subject areas where a crew member had given a low rating for habitability...|$|E
