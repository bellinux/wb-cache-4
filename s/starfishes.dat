500|$|The Russian {{zoologist}} Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov (1845–1916) first {{recognized that}} specialized cells {{were involved in}} defense against microbial infections. In 1882, he studied motile (freely moving) cells in the larvae of <b>starfishes,</b> believing they were important to the animals' immune defenses. To test his idea, he inserted small thorns from a tangerine tree into the larvae. [...] After a few hours {{he noticed that the}} motile cells had surrounded the thorns. Mechnikov traveled to Vienna and shared his ideas with Carl Friedrich Claus who suggested the name ‘‘phagocyte’’ (from the Greek words phagein, meaning [...] "to eat or devour", and kutos, meaning [...] "hollow vessel") for the cells that Mechnikov had observed.|$|E

6000|$|Professor E.S. Morse of Salem, Mass., {{found that}} most of the New England marine mollusca were protectively coloured; instancing among others a little red chiton on rocks clothed with red {{calcareous}} algae, and Crepidula plana, living within the apertures of the shells of larger species of Gasteropods and of a pure white colour corresponding to its habitat, while allied species living on seaweed or on the outside of dark shells were dark brown.[77] A still more interesting case has been recorded by Mr. George Brady. He says: [...] "Amongst the Nullipore which matted together the laminaria roots in the Firth of Clyde were living numerous small <b>starfishes</b> (Ophiocoma bellis) which, except when their writhing movements betrayed them, were quite undistinguishable from the calcareous branches of the alga; their rigid angularly twisted rays had all the appearance of the coralline, and exactly assimilated to its dark purple colour, so that though I held in my hand a root in which were half a dozen of the <b>starfishes,</b> I was really unable to detect them until revealed by their movements."[78] ...|$|E

60|$|As Dr. Wyville Thomson's recent letter, cited above, shows, {{the use of}} the trawl, {{at great}} depths, has brought to light a still greater {{diversity}} of life. Fishes came up from a depth of 600 to more than 1,000 fathoms, all in a peculiar condition from the expansion of the air contained in their bodies. On their relief from the extreme pressure, their eyes, especially, had a singular appearance, protruding like great globes from their heads. Bivalve and univalve mollusca seem to be rare at the greatest depths; but <b>starfishes,</b> sea urchins and other echinoderms, zoophytes, sponges, and protozoa abound.|$|E

60|$|Those who are {{acquainted with}} the {{existing}} systems of medical education will observe that, long as is the catalogue of studies which I have enumerated, I have omitted to mention several that enter into the usual medical curriculum of the present day. I have said not a word about zoology, comparative anatomy, botany, or materia medica. Assuredly this is from no light estimate of the value or importance of such studies in themselves. It may {{be taken for granted}} that I should be the last person in the world to object to the teaching of zoology, or comparative anatomy, in themselves; but I have the strongest feeling that, considering the number and the gravity of those studies through which a medical man must pass, if he is to be competent to discharge the serious duties which devolve upon him, subjects which lie so remote as these do from his practical pursuits should be rigorously excluded. The young man, who has enough {{to do in order to}} acquire such familiarity with the structure of the human body as will enable him to perform the operations of surgery, ought not, in my judgment, to be occupied with investigations into the anatomy of crabs and <b>starfishes.</b> Undoubtedly the doctor should know the common poisonous plants of his own country when he sees them; but that knowledge may be obtained by a few hours devoted to the examination of specimens of such plants, and the desirableness of such knowledge is no justification, to my mind, for spending three months over the study of systematic botany. Again, materia medica, so far as it is a knowledge of drugs, is the business of the druggist. In all other callings the necessity of the division of labour is fully recognised, and it is absurd to require of the medical man that he should not avail himself of the special knowledge of those whose business it is to deal in the drugs which he uses. It is all very well that the physician should know that castor oil comes from a plant, and castoreum from an animal, and how they are to be prepared; but for all the practical purposes of his profession that knowledge is not of one whit more value, has no more relevancy, than the knowledge of how the steel of his scalpel is made.|$|E

50|$|Since 2010, the Marine National Park Headquarters {{and some}} other {{organizations}} have inspected the coral reefs and removed crown-of-thorns <b>starfish,</b> which eat coral. No large populations of crown-of-thorns <b>starfish</b> were found in 2014 and 2015.

40|$|The crown-of-thorns <b>starfish</b> {{is one of}} only a few {{animals that}} feed on living coral tissue. The <b>starfish</b> is named for the dense {{covering}} of long, sharp spines on its upper surface. At low densities the crown-of-thorns <b>starfish</b> is a ‘normal’ part of the reef’s ecology. However, when the numbers of crown-of-thorns <b>starfish</b> on a reef increase {{to the point where they}} consume coral faster than it can grow, the <b>starfish</b> can dramatically reduce coral cover, resulting in a major disturbance to the whole system (see Environmental status - corals). This situation is commonly known as a crown-of-thorns <b>starfish</b> ‘outbreak’. Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns <b>starfish</b> have been a concern on the Great Barrier Reef for more than 40 years. Research suggests that the outbreak ‘trigger point’ is around 30 mature crown-of-thorns <b>starfish</b> per hectare of coral reef that has average levels of coral cover. Once crown-of-thorns <b>starfish</b> densities exceed this threshold, the population will begin to consume coral faster than it can grow and is considered to be an outbreak population...|$|R
