30|$|The {{physicochemical}} characteristics are crucial factors to the therapeutic performance of nanocarriers in drug delivery systems. The particle size {{would be a}} prerequisite since it influences drug efficacy and pharmacokinetics [31]. The size between 100 and 200  nm was demonstrated {{to be the best}} size for enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [32]. In this study, the average particle size of DOX-MWCNTs-PEG and DOX-MWCNTs-PEG-TAT were both perfectly controlled between 100 and 200  nm. Moreover, as electric charges repel each other, potentials on surface of the nanoparticles can prevent them from flocculation and keep them stable. Therefore, zeta potential was measured to verify the stability of the nanocarries. In our case, the modified MWCNTs were all <b>slightly</b> <b>negatively</b> charged (Table  1), which would be beneficial to their physical stability. As a result, the appropriate particle size and excellent stability suggested that DOX-MWCNTs-PEG and DOX-MWCNTs-PEG-TAT would be suitable for drug delivery.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{adds to the}} {{relationship}} lending debate by investigating detailed contract information obtained from examining nearly eighteen thousand bank loans. The beneficiaries all were very small firms that operate within the continental European bank-based system. That is, with data gathered for Belgium, we investigate price and non-price terms of the loan contract. We test {{for the possibility of}} intertemporal rent shifting by banks. The empirical evidence shows two opposing effects. On the one hand, the length of a bank-firm relationship increases the loan rate. On the other hand, widening {{the relationship}} by buying other information sensitive products from a bank decreases the loan rate. Thus the effect on the price operates more through the dimension of the relationship than through the length of the relationship. We also find that the length of the financial relationship <b>slightly</b> <b>negatively</b> influences the probability of pledging collateral. ...|$|R
30|$|Although the {{magnitudes}} {{and patterns}} of streamflow response to changes in precipitation and temperature differ due to varied interpolation algorithms, the streamflow is positively related to precipitation but <b>slightly</b> <b>negatively</b> related to temperature, with the precipitation-streamflow sensitivity greater than the streamflow-temperature sensitivity (Figure  8). This result is remarkably consistent with that of monthly water balance model {{as stated in the}} previous sections. It is also similar to the results of the Sacramento Basin (Risbey and Entekhabi, 1996). That is, the basin streamflow amount displays a strong dependence on precipitation, but virtually no dependence on temperature. However, it is distinctly different from the Murray-Darling Basin (Yu et al., 2010), the Yellow River Basin and the Spokane River Basin (Fu et al., 2007 a, b), in terms of temperature impacts on streamflow. However, in term of precipitation elasticity of streamflow, these four watersheds seem to respond in a similar pattern with slightly difference of magnitudes.|$|R
30|$|Our work {{demonstrated}} that silica nanoparticles with different surface charges {{were capable of}} altering the wettability of sandstone cores as determined by contact angle estimation. Additionally, these materials impacted the oil recovery process in different extents. While MeO-PEG-SNPs (<b>slightly</b> <b>negatively</b> charged nanoparticles) showed the highest oil recovery at a low concentration (100  mg/L), at a higher concentration (200  mg/L), Neg-SNPs demonstrated {{to be the most}} effective in recovering oil from sandstone cores. Moreover, the concentration {{plays an important role in}} evaluating the impact of the surface charge on oil recovery. As the concentration increased, Neg-SNPs and AP-SNPs improved the wettability and the oil recovery process. On the other hand, the effectiveness of MeO-PEG-SNPs decreased as the concentration increased. Overall, the results obtained from this study could not only give a deeper insight of the interaction between nanofluids and porous media, but could also provide additional information about the optimal structural characteristics that SNPs should meet to maximize oil recovery.|$|R
30|$|The {{nanostructure}} of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) adsorption {{layer on}} the surface of mesoporous-activated carbon HPA obtained by physical activation of residue after supercritical extraction of hops was characterized. This characterization has been done based on the analysis of determination of adsorbed polymer amount, surface charge density, and zeta potential of solid particles (without and in the PAA presence). The SEM, thermogravimetric, FTIR, and MS techniques have allowed one to examine the solid surface morphology and specify different kinds of HPA surface groups. The effects of solution pH, as well as polymer molecular weight and concentration, were studied. The obtained results indicated that the highest adsorption on the activated carbon surface was exhibited by PAA with lower molecular weight (i.e., 2000  Da) at pH 3. Under such conditions, polymeric adsorption layer is composed of nanosized PAA coils (<b>slightly</b> <b>negatively</b> charged) which are densely packed on the positive surface of HPA. Additionally, the adsorption of polymeric macromolecules into solid pores is possible.|$|R

Moreover, recent advances in pharmacological interventions have led to an emerging field of new therapeutic approaches. Among them, targeted RNA delivery is exceptionally promising. On the one hand, RNA displays properties leading to general activation {{of the immune system}}, resembling pathways of adjuvants necessary for vaccines for infectious diseases. On the other hand, when targeted delivery is achieved, encoded information is translated and presented to T cells, which results in proliferation of cytotoxic T cells directed towards the intended target. For example, systemic application of <b>slightly</b> <b>negatively</b> charged RNA-lipoplexes (lipoplex) was shown to not only maximize spleen targeting but also achieve strong RNA uptake is antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells. T cells primed with those antigen-presenting dendritic cells are then able to migrate and accumulate to tumor sites and attack the tumor by recognizing their specific antigen [2].|$|R
