40|$|Runtime {{incremental}} parallel <b>scheduling</b> (RIPS) is a {{new approach}} for load balancing. In parallel <b>scheduling,</b> all processors cooperate together to balance the workload.

In incremental <b>scheduling,</b> the system <b>scheduling</b> activity alternates with the underlying computation work. RIPS produces high-quality load balancing and adapts to applications of nonuniform structures. This paper presents methods for <b>scheduling</b> a single job on a dedicated parallel machine. 1 Introduction There are two basic <b>scheduling</b> strategies: static <b>scheduling</b> and dynamic <b>scheduling.</b> Static <b>scheduling</b> distributes the workload at compile time. Dynamic <b>scheduling</b> performs <b>scheduling</b> activities at runtime. Static <b>scheduling</b> applies to problems with a predictable structure, which are called static problems.

40|$|<b>Scheduling</b> {{problems}} {{are found in}} a lot of application domains. Well known is the <b>scheduling</b> of production where manufacturing operations have to be assigned to limited resources like machines, but also other applications are important, e. g., the <b>scheduling</b> of airline crews, space missions, projects in different domains, clinical surgery, even timetabling and processor <b>scheduling</b> include <b>scheduling</b> problems. In general, <b>scheduling</b> deals with the temporal assignment of activities to limited resources where a set of constraints has to be regarded. Due to the exponential size of <b>scheduling</b> problems it is quite difficult to create good or optimal <b>schedules</b> shown by optimized goal functions or other evaluation criteria. But not only the generation of a <b>schedule</b> is a hard problem, even harder- and the normal case in everyday work- is the adaptation of an existing <b>schedule</b> to the changing <b>scheduling</b> environment. The changes include events like resource breakdowns as well as limitations or prescriptions interactively given by the user of the <b>scheduling</b> system. <b>Scheduling</b> systems have been built to support the users in performing their <b>scheduling</b> tasks. The systems include <b>scheduling</b> knowledge as well as presentation and database components. In this chapter an overview of <b>scheduling</b> problems, techniques to solve <b>scheduling</b> problems, <b>scheduling</b> systems as well as research issues in <b>scheduling</b> is given...|$|R
