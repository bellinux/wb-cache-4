40|$|Abstract We {{introduce}} a new illusion that contradicts common assumptions {{in the field of}} visual motion perception. When an unoccluded bar moves at certain speeds and oscillates at certain frequencies, the perceived direction of the bar is not predicted by its intrinsic terminators but is biased to move in the direction orthogonal to its orientation. It appears that the veridical terminator motions are integrated with <b>spurious</b> <b>component</b> motion signals, generating an at times complex pattern of motion around an apparently closed loop path. In the absence of oscillation the effect does not occur. Several factors, including optimal angle, speed, and oscillating distance of the bar, are quantified and possible mechanisms are discussed. In a model, we suggest that the effect arises because of the failure to inhibit <b>spurious</b> <b>component</b> motion signals arising from contours that are nearly oriented along the direction of true motion...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the EMI filter models for the {{calculation}} of the insertion loss characteristics. The insertion loss {{is in fact the}} basic EMI filter property. Unfortunately {{it is not easy to}} precisely define and measure this parameter in a wide frequency range due to variability of terminating impedances. The uncertainty of the potential impedance termination really complicates the measurements and also comparison of the performance of filters. A model with <b>spurious</b> <b>components</b> is introduced in this paper. The procedure model design is also added up. The <b>spurious</b> <b>components</b> make together with the real ones form resonant circuits. The resonance frequencies make breakages in the insertion loss characteristic. Their resonance frequencies were identified by the analysis of equivalent circuits of the filter for different measuring systems. The calculation of the values of <b>spurious</b> <b>components,</b> based on knowledge of resonance frequencies, is mentioned at the end of the paper...|$|R

The {{characteristics of the}} torque sensors were evaluated by using the IMGC-CNR six-component calibration system (EUROMET agree facility, project 113). The repeatability of the absolute variation of the output signal of the two TTS under {{the application of the}} different <b>spurious</b> <b>components,</b> referred to the R.

40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} tunable lasers, {{that may affect}} system performance, {{is that they can}} generate light at various wavelengths as they tune between different wavelength channels. These <b>spurious</b> <b>components</b> could cause severe cross-channel interference if the tunable laser is used in a WDM network. In this paper we investigate the effect of such interfering signals, generated by up to three tunable lasers during a switching event, on the BER of a data channel transmitted on the same wavelength as the <b>spurious</b> <b>components.</b> The results show that it is vital to attenuate the output of tunable lasers during their wavelength transition in order to prevent system performance degradation...|$|R

Our technique uses a stepping-motor-driven variable neutral-density filter which keeps the dc component of the detecting signal constant by varying the light flux impinging into the specimen under test. This enabled extremely facile a-posteriori subtraction of the <b>spurious</b> <b>component</b> of the photoreflectance, which has been often problematic for the precise measurements.

40|$|A {{modified}} {{scheme for}} electron-beam (E-beam) writing {{used in the}} fabrication of convex or concave diffraction gratings {{makes it possible to}} suppress the ghost diffraction heretofore exhibited by such gratings. Ghost diffraction is a <b>spurious</b> <b>component</b> of diffraction caused by a <b>spurious</b> <b>component</b> of grating periodicity as described below. The ghost diffraction orders appear between the main diffraction orders and are typically more intense than is the diffuse scattering from the grating. At such high intensity, ghost diffraction is the dominant source of degradation of grating performance. The pattern of a convex or concave grating is established by electron-beam writing in a resist material coating a substrate that has the desired convex or concave shape. Unfortunately, {{as a result of the}} characteristics of electrostatic deflectors used to control the electron beam, it is possible to expose only a small field - typically between 0. 5 and 1. 0 mm wide - at a given fixed position of the electron gun relative to the substrate. To make a grating larger than the field size, it is necessary to move the substrate to make it possible to write fields centered at different positions, so that the larger area is synthesized by "stitching" the exposed fields...|$|E

These problems appear during the measurement of insertion loss of filters and by design of EMI mains filter. The important problem is uncertainly of the terminating impedances. Eventualities measurement insertion loss of EMI mains filter and motivation of creation filter models are shown. The following part of this project shows the electronic components, from which are realized the EMI mains filter. Parasitic properties of these real devices are also discussed. The circuitry of EMI mains filter is described by the Modified Nodal Voltage Method. The optimization method called Participle Swarm Optimization is introduced, too.

Magnetic factor coefficient k is searched by the optimization method PSO. The last part of this thesis deals with creation of the alternative circuits with <b>spurious</b> filters <b>components.</b> The performances of the alternative circuits were compared with the measured data for symmetrical and asymmetrical measurement setup.

This research develops an algorithm that provides both localization of dispersion curves and elimination of <b>spurious</b> <b>components.</b> To achieve this, an alternative formulation of reassignment called differential reassignment is modified and superimposed with nonlinear anisotropic diffusion. This study first examines reassignment and diffusion components individually. Three different versions of differential reassignment are considered, {{two of which are}} modifications explicitly derived in this research. The combined algorithm is then applied to reassign experimentally measured spectrograms, leading to a significant increase in clarity and notch detection performance. M. S.

The resulting system exhibits the interaction of two types of components: a physical one and a spurious one, related to the possible discontinuities that the numerical solution allows. Each dispersion relation contains critical points where the corresponding group velocity vanishes. Following previous constructions, we rigorously build wave packets with arbitrarily small velocity of propagation concentrated either on the physical or on the <b>spurious</b> <b>component.</b> We also develop filtering mechanisms aimed at recovering the uniform velocity of propagation of the continuous solutions.

Two samples will be employed; one investigating the perceived usefulness-use correlations reported in the TAM literature and the other investigating the attitude behavior (physical activity) correlation reported literature drawing upon Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB).

40|$|Staleness in {{measured}} prices imparts {{a positive}} statistical bias and a negative dilution effect on mutual fund performance. First, evaluating performance with nonsynchronous data generates a <b>spurious</b> <b>component</b> of alpha. Second, stale prices create arbitrage opportunities for high-frequency traders whose trades dilute the portfolio returns and hence fund performance. This paper introduces {{a model that}} evaluates fund performance while controlling directly for these biases. Empirical tests of the model show that alpha net of these biases is on average positive although not significant and about 40 basis points higher than alpha measured without controlling for the impacts of stale pricing. The difference between the net alpha and the measured alpha consists of three components: a statistical bias, the dilution effect of long-term fund flows, and the dilution effect of arbitrage flows. Whereas the two former are small, the latter is large and widespread in the fund industry...|$|E
40|$|Models of {{the main}} {{geomagnetic}} field are generally represented by a scalar potential gamma expanded in {{a finite number of}} spherical harmonics. Very accurate observations of F were used, but indications exist that the accuracy of models derived from them is considerably lower. One problem is that F does not always characterize gamma uniquely. It is not clear whether such ambiguity can be encountered in deriving gamma from F in geomagnetic surveys, but there exists a connection, {{due to the fact that}} the counterexamples of Backus are related to the dipole field, while the geomagnetic field is dominated by its dipole component. If the models are recovered with a finite error (i. e. they cannot completely fit the data and consequently have a small <b>spurious</b> <b>component),</b> this connection allows the error in certain sequences of harmonic terms in gamma to be enhanced without unduly large effects on the fit of F to the model...|$|E
30|$|Continuous {{observations}} {{with spring}} gravimeters conducted at Etna volcano during these short-lived but intense paroxysmal events have shown significant {{variations in the}} amplitude of the gravity signals, which correspond temporally {{with the increase in}} amplitude of seismic activity (Bonaccorso et al. 2011 a, [b]). Since all relative gravimeters are more or less subject to offsets (tares) due to shock when subjected to severe vibrations {{for long periods of time}} (Seigel 1995), we investigated if the observed large gravity variations (hundreds of microgals (μGal); 1 μGal[*]=[*] 1 [*]×[*] 10 − 8  m/s 2) could be ascribed not only to the subsurface mass redistribution phenomena but also to the mechanical response of the gravimeter to ground acceleration caused by seismic wave propagation, both in the vertical and in the horizontal components. In such a case, the observed gravity signal should be the combination of (i) a component due to the subsurface mass or density variations accompanying the ascent of magma to the Earth's surface and (ii) a <b>spurious</b> <b>component</b> due to the effects of transient ground acceleration caused by seismic wave propagation.|$|E

30|$|Decomposition {{prediction}} models {{based on}} empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) have grown popular {{in recent years}} [26, 28]. However, the EMD and EEMD suffer “endpoint effects” during the decomposition process where divergence phenomena occur {{at the edge of}} the data. During the iteration process, the endpoint effect causes “pollution” in the data. This gradually moves inwards. As the iterations progress, the data sequence may grow severely distorted with modal aliasing and <b>spurious</b> <b>components</b> [29]. The variational mode decomposition (VMD) method, which is completely theoretically distinct from EMD and EEMD, has been successfully applied to similar fields such as fault diagnosis research [30, 31, 32] and power quality feature selection [33].|$|R
40|$|Noncontiguous {{transmission}} schemes {{combined with}} high power-efficiency requirements pose big challenges for radio transmitter and power amplifier (PA) design and implementation. Due to the nonlinear {{nature of the}} PA, severe unwanted emissions can occur, which can potentially interfere with neighboring channel signals or even desensitize the own receiver in frequency division duplexing (FDD) transceivers. In this article, to suppress such unwanted emissions, a low-complexity sub-band DPD solution, specifically tailored for spectrally noncontiguous transmission schemes in low-cost devices, is proposed. The proposed technique aims at mitigating only the selected spurious intermodulation distortion components at the PA output, hence allowing for substantially reduced processing complexity compared to classical linearization solutions. Furthermore, novel decorrelation based parameter learning solutions are also proposed and formulated, which offer reduced computing complexity in parameter estimation {{as well as the}} ability to track time-varying features adaptively. Comprehensive simulation and RF measurement results are provided, using a commercial LTE-Advanced mobile PA, to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in real world scenarios.

40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} for {{excitation}} of coil-less fluxgate is presented. The {{purpose of this}} method {{is to reduce the}} <b>spurious</b> <b>component</b> of the output voltage, allowing us to increase the amplification. The method is based on the employment of two coil-less fluxgates in a double bridge, which injects pulsing current in opposite direction in each wire. By taking the difference of the voltages on the two wires, we suppress the component of the voltages, which does not change under application of external measured field. The sensitive axes are in opposite direction, so the wire feels opposite field. As a result, we will obtain an output voltage with low peak value, including only the component of the voltage that changes when we apply external field. Finally, we propose an improved version of the double bridge to allow the employment of two sensing elements with difference characteristics. This is obtained by optimizing the suppression of the spurious voltages and, at the same time, setting independently chosen values of exciting current for each wire...|$|E
40|$|A polarity-coincidence {{detector}} with biased polarity indicators (biased hard limiters) is {{studied to}} determine the effects of the bias on the detector output mean value, output variance, and output signal-to-noise power ratio. The mean value of the detector output is derived for the case of Gaussian input signal and Gaussian input noise, with arbitrary spectra for the signal and noise. The mean value is expressed as a function of the input signal-to-noise power ratio, and as a function of the biases in the input channel and the reference channel polarity indicators. It is shown that the effect of bias is to introduce a <b>spurious</b> <b>component</b> in the output mean value. The variance of the defector output is derived for the cage of Gaussian input signal and Gaussian input noise, with RC low-pass spectra for signal and noise, for small input signal-to-noise power ratios only. The variance is expressed as a function of the biases in the input channel and reference channel polarity indicators, and as a function of the input signal-to-noise band-width radio. It is shown that the effect of bias is to introduce a <b>spurious</b> <b>component</b> in the output variance. The output signal-to-noise power ratio (the square of the output mean divided by the output variance) is derived for both an ideal polarity-coincidence detector (no bias) and for a biased polarity-coincidence detector. The output signal-to-noise power ratio is expressed as a function of the input signal-to-noise power ratio, the biases in the input channel and the reference channel polarity indicators, and input signal-to-noise band-width ratio, for small input signal-to-noise power ratios only. It is shown that the output signal-to-noise power ratio of an ideal polarity-coincidence detector is degraded from that of a correlation detector. When the input signal-to-noise band-width ratio is unity, the degradation is about 1. 4 db. The degradation increases to about 2. 2 db. when the input signal-to noise band-width ratio becomes either very small or very large. It is also shown that the output signal-to-noise power ratio of a biased polarity-coincidence detector is degraded from that of an ideal polarity-coincidence detector. A simple expression for the degradation is presented. Limits on the biases are given, such that when the biases are smaller than these limits, the degradation of the output signal-to-noise power ratio is negligible...|$|E
