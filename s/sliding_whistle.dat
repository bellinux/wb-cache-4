5000|$|A {{more recent}} {{appearance}} of the <b>slide</b> <b>whistle</b> {{can be heard in}} the 1979 song [...] "Get Up" [...] by Vernon Burch. The <b>slide</b> <b>whistle</b> segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit [...] "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas-based band Holes and Hearts also used the <b>slide</b> <b>whistle</b> on their song [...] "Dancing Monkey".|$|R
5000|$|The R3-30 {{traditionally}} announces each week's biggest chart dropper with a descending <b>slide</b> <b>whistle</b> tone. After [...] "Ventriloquist Love" [...] {{dropped from}} No. 9 to No. 19 {{the week of}} January 19, 2007, resulting in use of the <b>slide</b> <b>whistle,</b> the band humorously criticized R3-30 host Craig Norris' musical abilities, challenging him to record a whole song on <b>slide</b> <b>whistle.</b> After Norris published a lighthearted apology on the CBC Radio 3 site, Fabergé subsequently released an audio retort which included three short sarcastic songs about Norris by Maylee Todd, Dan Werb and Fabergé himself.|$|R

5000|$|The swanee whistle {{dates back}} at least to the 1840s, when it was {{manufactured}} by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early <b>slide</b> <b>whistles</b> were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the <b>slide</b> <b>whistle</b> was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example, it was used on Paul Whiteman's early hit recording of [...] "Whispering" [...] (1920). Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the <b>slide</b> <b>whistle</b> for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, such as [...] "Sobbin' Blues" [...] (1923). At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler's Jug Band. Gavin Gordon uses a <b>slide</b> <b>whistle</b> in his ballet The Rake's Progress (1935).|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Slide</b> <b>Whistle</b> : Franken {{played a}} <b>slide</b> <b>whistle</b> {{along with the}} highs and lows of President Bush's {{approval}} rating since taking office. The whistle started with a moderate note, raised to a high note to reflect the time period following 9/11, then steadily sunk to lower notes as Bush's popularity decreased (with occasional blips of higher notes in between). This was a popular segment surrounding State of the Union addresses.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>slide</b> <b>whistle</b> is {{probably}} thought of today {{primarily as a}} kind of [...] "toy" [...] instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of [...] "serious" [...] music. Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith's Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio's Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki (De Natura Sonoris II, 1971). John Cage's Music of Changes (1951) and Water Music (1952) both feature <b>slide</b> <b>whistle</b> and duck calls. The <b>slide</b> <b>whistle</b> is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.|$|R
