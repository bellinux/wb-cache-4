500|$|After the Indiana game, Dari Nowkhah {{wrote in}} ESPN's [...] "Heisman Watch" [...] column that Robinson was [...] "running {{away with the}} Heisman Trophy" [...] and {{compared}} him to 1988 Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders:"We haven't seen this type of college football playmaker since ... Barry Sanders? [...] I'm not saying Robinson reminds me of Sanders. (How could a quarterback remind me of a running back?) But there is a shocking resemblance between the diminutive playmakers in their speed, elusiveness and quickness. So is the effect the two have on my <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> right and wrong. Being that dominant on a football field somehow feels wrong. It's unfair." ...|$|E
500|$|Jamahl Epsicokhan on {{his website}} [...] "Jammer's Reviews", {{thought that the}} episode's story bore {{similarities}} to the [...] episode [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] due to the alternative timeline and also the film Memento due to the memory issues suffered by Archer. Epsicokhan also suggested that the flashback sequences were similar to the [...] episode [...] "", but was a [...] "substantially less poignant take on hypothetical material". He said that the episode had [...] "something for everyone", with an [...] "apocalyptic" [...] action storyline which tied in neatly to an interesting character drama. He gave the episode a score of {{three and a half}} out of four. The review on Ain't It Cool News also suggested that the storyline had been inspired by a number of different episodes in the Star Trek franchise, including the Voyager episodes [...] "Year of Hell" [...] and [...] "", as well as The Next Generation [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] and [...] "". But the reviewer thought that the episode presented the viewer with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> at stake with the fight against the Xindi for the first time, and gave the episode a score of four out of five, a grade described as [...] "better than most motion pictures".|$|E
2500|$|Bion's {{concept of}} {{maternal}} [...] "reverie" [...] as {{the capacity to}} sense (and make <b>sense</b> <b>of)</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> {{going on inside the}} infant has been an important element in post-Kleinian thought: [...] "Reverie is an act of faith in unconscious process ... essential to alpha-function'" [...] It is considered the equivalent of Stern's attunement, or Winnicott's maternal preoccupation.|$|E
60|$|Agnes refused by a gesture. Lady Montbarry's {{interruption}} had roused her <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> due to herself. She resumed her reply in plainer terms.|$|R
60|$|But that {{suggestion}} was altogether {{too much for}} poor Master Skyffington's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> due to so noble a family, and to its exalted head.|$|R
5000|$|... “He had an {{enormous}} impact on Australian publishing. He had a deeply inquiring mind, a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> right and wrong and a deep human compassion.” ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2003, {{when asked}} if there was any figure in popular culture who aroused {{interest}} in poetry and lyrics, Heaney praised American rap artist Eminem from Detroit, saying, [...] "He has created a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> possible. He has sent a voltage around a generation. He has done this not just through his subversive attitude but also his verbal energy." [...] Heaney wrote the poem [...] "Beacons at Bealtaine" [...] to mark the 2004 EU Enlargement. He read the poem at a ceremony for the 25 leaders of the enlarged European Union, arranged by the Irish EU presidency.|$|E
2500|$|To Jameson, all of Huston's {{films are}} adaptations, and he {{believes}} that through his films there was a [...] "cohesive world-view, not only thematically but also stylistically; there is the Huston look". The [...] "Huston look" [...] was also noted by screenwriter James Agee, who adds that this [...] "look proceeds from Huston's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> natural to the eye and his delicate, simple feeling for space relationships." [...] In any case, notes Flint, Huston took [...] "uncommon care to preserve the writer's styles and values... and sought repeatedly to transpose the interior essence of literature to film with dramatic and visual tension", {{as he did in}} Red Badge of Courage, Moby Dick, and Under the Volcano.|$|E
2500|$|Sondheim also mentored {{a fledgling}} Jonathan Larson, {{attending}} Larson's workshop for his Superbia (a musical version of Nineteen Eighty-Four). In Larson's musical Tick, Tick... Boom!, the phone message is played in which Sondheim apologizes for leaving early, {{says he wants}} to meet him and is impressed with his work. After Larson's death, Sondheim called him one of the few composers [...] "attempting to blend contemporary pop music with theater music, which doesn't work very well; {{he was on his way}} to finding a real synthesis. A good deal of pop music has interesting lyrics, but they are not theater lyrics". A musical-theatre composer [...] "must have a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> theatrical, of how you use music to tell a story, as opposed to writing a song. Jonathan understood that instinctively." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned at}} the sound of voices and sank into a chair. To have been caught thus gazing at himself would have jarred on his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> right.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Null {{answered}} with his customary <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> due to himself. [...] "As the medical attendant of the family, your son naturally supposed, madam, that Miss Carmina was under my care." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 17. Whereat the Devil took offence, And swore in {{his soul}} a great oath then, 'That for his damned {{impertinence}} [...] 455 He'd bring him to a proper <b>sense</b> <b>Of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> due to gentlemen!' ...|$|R
2500|$|Kings is [...] "history-like" [...] {{rather than}} {{history in the}} modern sense, mixing legends, folktales, miracle stories and [...] "fictional constructions" [...] in with the annals, and its primary {{explanation}} for all that happens is God's offended <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> right; it is therefore more fruitful to read it as theological literature {{in the form of}} history. The theological bias is seen in the way it judges each king of Israel on the basis of whether he recognises the authority of the Temple in Jerusalem (none do, and therefore all are [...] "evil"), and each king of Judah on the basis of whether he destroys the [...] "high places" [...] (rivals to the Temple in Jerusalem); it gives only passing mention to important and successful kings like Omri and Jeroboam II and totally ignores {{one of the most significant}} events in ancient Israel's history, the battle of Qarqar.|$|E
2500|$|He had {{an abiding}} {{confidence}} in the natural, untutored instinct for rightness and beauty in the average person: [...] "all men have <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> right in this matter, if they would only use and apply this sense; every man knows where and how beauty gives him pleasure, if he would only ask for it when he does so, and not {{allow it to be}} forced upon him when he does not want it." [...] This contrasts with the thread of modernism that holds that people must be taught to appreciate good design. Another contrast with modernism is in the aesthetic of functionality: Ruskin saw no beauty in well-designed tools: beauty is out of place where there is not serene leisure, or [...] "if you thrust it into the places of toil. Put it in the drawing-room, not into the workshop; put it on domestic furniture, not upon tools of handicraft." [...] For Ruskin, Beauty was not an inherent characteristic but a thing that could be applied to an object or withheld from it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet, methinks, Rose, a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> due to {{ourselves}} {{and to others}} may, if listened to, guide and comfort us under such feelings even as thou hast described." ...|$|E
60|$|While he was speaking, {{the young}} lady in {{question}} passed out, greeting the Warden in a cheerful, respectful way, in which deference to him was well combined with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> due to herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Often," [...] she murmured, [...] "one has {{to suffer}} {{for doing the}} right thing. My father has made himself a poor man because <b>of</b> his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> right. I {{do not know what}} to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pity for {{the young}} man, and a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> due from Maria to her friend--her affianced lover--in misfortune, sure these were motives {{sufficient}} to make her act as she did," [...] replies Lord Castlewood, demurely.|$|R
6000|$|... "A proper confidant," [...] {{said the}} lady, [...] "and chosen {{with the same}} {{delicate}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> due to yourself and others!--But what ails you, maiden--where are you going?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And tell me," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "isn't it {{sometimes}} {{the case that}} you start out intent on one ending, and that your artistic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> fitting demands another?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, mother, I cannot. If Rachel is not {{hindered}} {{from such}} meetings {{by her own}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> right, she must be hindered by the authority of those older than herself." ...|$|E
5000|$|Finley adds, [...] "There was themis—custom, tradition, folk-ways, mores, {{whatever}} we may call it, the enormous power of 'it is (or is not) done'. The world of Odysseus had a highly developed <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> fitting and proper." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bernard {{succumbed to}} cancer in 2000. In the photographer's obituary, Searle remarked: [...] "Bernard's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> {{good and bad}} art, good and bad {{photography}} had an almost moral dimension, but one which was entirely personal, and thoroughly ethical.|$|R
60|$|Then a wild {{resolve to}} confirm his worst <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> {{on the other}} side of the wall made him seize a log, put it against the stones, clutch the parapet with {{insecure}} fingers, and lug himself to a momentary balance on the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gracious Heaven! {{and could}} the yellow metal--the {{glittering}} earth-- so far overcome every <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> thereby represented?--Father Abbot, I pray, as a dear boon, you will deliver this guilty person to my mercy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "you know. I've {{thrown away}} {{common sense and}} prudence, all <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> fitting and all that is due to you. None of those things seem to count just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then there's {{only one}} thing to do. You must find my father and tell him all. Perhaps you may rouse him to a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> right. You may make him {{remember}} that he has duties as a parent." ...|$|E
60|$|The eternal contradictions {{which go}} {{to make up}} the complex nature of an {{emotional}} woman were quite incomprehensible to him. Juliette had betrayed him to serve her own <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> just and right, her revenge and her oath. Therefore she did not love him.|$|R
60|$|And then of {{a sudden}} her regard for respectability and Clyde’s <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> right were thrown on the scrap-heap of {{unnecessary}} things. They had been useful and highly important in their time, but the death of Vanessa’s husband made them of no immediate moment.|$|R
60|$|This sort of thing, kept {{up for an}} hour or so at a time, used {{to drive}} me nearly wild. But Euphemia did not mind it. I believe that she had so {{delicate}} a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> proper, that she did not hear Pomona's private readings.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Andrew," [...] she said, [...] "there {{is my own}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> seemly and--must I use the horrid word?--my {{reputation}} to be considered. As it is, you may be seen {{leaving the}} house in the small hours of the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say again, I am much {{obliged to}} you. Why weaken my <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> your due in obligation, by preferring {{enormous}} claims upon me? Trouble, sorrow, affliction, adversity! One might suppose I had been dying {{a score of}} deaths here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mildred, {{beyond what}} you have just said I know nothing of the {{contents}} of these letters; but whatever they may be, here and now, before I read them, I again offer to marry you. I owe it to you and to my own <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> right that I should marry you." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "He {{was a man}} {{of great}} {{independence}} and decision - bold, keen and sarcastic, and spoke his mind of men and measures with great freedom.....He was naturally inclined to be arbitrary and haughty, but his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> right, and his pride prevented him from doing intentional evil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You tell me," [...] said he, [...] "that {{the soul}} is immaterial. Now, matter is that of which we can have {{knowledge}} through one or more <b>of</b> our <b>senses.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> immaterial--not matter--we can gain no knowledge in that way. How, then, can we know anything about it?" ...|$|R
60|$|The lantern-jawed Barker {{had entered}} softly, and was {{standing}} deferentially in the doorway. There was no emotion {{on his face}} beyond the vague sadness which a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> correct made him always wear like a sort of mask when {{in the presence of}} those of superior station.|$|R
