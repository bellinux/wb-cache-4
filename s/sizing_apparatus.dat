40|$|ObjectiveWe have {{performed}} an original aortic valve reconstruction using autologous pericardium. The feasibility for patients aged less than 60 years is reviewed. MethodsFrom April 2007 to April 2013, aortic valve reconstruction {{was performed in}} 108 patients aged less than 60 years. A total of 51 patients had aortic stenosis, 7 patients had annuloaortic ectasia, 7 patients had infective endocarditis, and 43 patients had aortic regurgitation. Fifty-seven patients had bicuspid valves, and  11 patients had unicuspid valves. There were 75 male and 33 female patients, with a mean age of  47. 8  ±  11. 2 years. Preoperative echocardiography showed an average peak pressure gradient of 86. 1  ± 35. 1 mm Hg with aortic stenosis. The surgical procedure {{is based on the}} independent tricuspid replacement using autologous pericardium. First, the distance between the commissures is measured using an original <b>sizing</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and then the pericardial cusp is trimmed using an original template and sutured to the annulus. ResultsThere was no conversion to prosthetic valve replacement. There were no in-hospital mortalities. Postoperative echocardiography showed an average peak pressure gradient of 14. 8 ± 7. 8 mm Hg 1 week after surgery and 12. 8 ± 3. 1 mm Hg 4 years after surgery. One patient required reoperation because of infective endocarditis. The other 107 patients showed less than mild aortic regurgitation. No thromboembolic events were recorded. The mean follow-up period was 34. 2 ± 15. 7 months. Freedom from reoperation was 98. 9 % with 76 months of follow-up.

There were 289 patients with aortic stenosis and 115 patients with aortic regurgitation. One hundred two patients had bicuspid aortic valves, 13 patients had unicuspid valves, and 2 patients had quadricuspid valves. There were 201 males and 203 females. Mean age was 69. 0  ±  12. 9 years. Preoperative echocardiography revealed an average peak pressure gradient of 79. 6  ±  32. 5 mm Hg with aortic stenosis.

Starting with flax rovings of different <b>sizes,</b> an <b>apparatus</b> {{was developed to}} feed and align the rovings over the wet-end section of a paper machine. The short kraft paper fibers are therefore mixed with the long flax roving as the machine is running, {{and at the end}} of the process, a sheet of the hybrid dry reinforcement is obtained and cut to size for impregnation with various resins, using different processes. This novel manufacturing process allows for high volume production of reinforcement. It is very flexible, and many different combinations of long and short fibers can be exploited for the production of a vast variety of dry reinforcements. In this paper, composite samples are obtained out of these reinforcements, using the resin infusion (RI) molding process with a commercial epoxy resin. The results are compared with those of usual glass fiber reinforcement. An interesting aspect is that the large variability, typical for natural fibers, is largely reduced when the short kraft fibers are present in the composite. In terms of permeability to resin, reasonably comparable values can be obtained compared to that of glass fabrics, if a low surface density of reinforcement is chosen...|$|R
