5|$|When {{repairs to}} Craven Sluices were {{necessary}} in 1684, {{the water was}} temporarily diverted into Scots Float Channel. This worked well, and a regulating penn was built, so that water could be routed to Craven Sluices or Scots Float. Knock <b>Sluice</b> was built below the Appledore <b>Sluice</b> in 1686, and land above it was reclaimed. In 1696, New Knock <b>Sluice</b> was built, close to Craven Sluices, and the sea was finally excluded from the Wittersham Levels.|$|E
5|$|Iden Lock {{connected}} the Royal Military Canal to the river. The last commercial barge to pass from the Rother through Iden lock onto the canal was the Vulture, carrying 27 tons of shingle on 15 December 1909. After that, the lock {{was replaced by}} a <b>sluice,</b> severing the navigable connection. The river was used by pleasure craft in Edwardian times, when regular boat trips from Scots Float <b>Sluice,</b> then called Star Lock, to Bodiam Castle were offered. The lower river is currently used for moorings, and the Bodiam Ferry Company operate a trip boat from Newenden Bridge to Bodiam Castle.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to drain Holland Fen, and prevent {{flooding}} from the River Witham, an adventurer called Earl Fitzwilliam constructed a drain in 1720, which runs broadly parallel to the River Witham, and terminated at Lodewick's Gowt, a <b>sluice</b> which he constructed on the Witham close {{to the location of}} the present Grand <b>Sluice.</b> The drain was for many years called Earl Fitzwilliam's drain, but is now called the North Forty-Foot Drain. The scheme was not entirely successful.|$|E
40|$|The general goal of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{properties}} of <b>sluicing</b> (IP-ellipsis) in Russian and to see how the Russian data shed light on the general processes underlying the phenomenon of <b>sluicing.</b> The first issue we will address is what positions wh-remnants occupy in <b>sluicing</b> constructions in Russian, considering the properties of wh-movement in Russian. We will then turn to <b>sluicing</b> with multiple wh-remnants, which I will refer to as multiple <b>sluicing,</b> following Takahashi (1994). Here we will investigate how the interpretative properties of multiple interrogatives in Russian affect the multiple <b>sluicing</b> possibilities in this language. Finally, I will present the data showing that superiority effects emerge under <b>sluicing</b> in Russian. This is unexpected, given that Russian does not exhibit superiority effects in corresponding non-elliptical interrogatives. In addressing the question of what causes superiority effects under <b>sluicing,</b> I will propose an analysis which makes use of an independent property of ellipsis, namely, quantifier parallelism...|$|R

5|$|Stanmoor lock was {{constructed}} above the junction with the River Tone, but {{all traces of}} it have gone. Next to the pedestrian bridge at Stathe four living willow cones, which were woven in 1997 by Clare Wilks, have now rooted and sprouted. Oath lock no longer functions as a lock, but the <b>sluice</b> is used to regulate the river levels. Below Langport, the river is crossed by a lattice girder bridge, carrying the Taunton to Westbury railway line, which approaches the crossing on multi-arched viaducts. This {{is followed by the}} derelict remains of the Langport lock and <b>sluice.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{alternative}} route via Horseway <b>sluice</b> and the Old Bedford River {{has been closed}} for several years. The lock at Welches Dam has been closed as being unsafe and a reedbed has taken hold. Very low water levels between Horseway <b>sluice</b> and Welches Dam lock often prevented passage. This stands to be improved, however, {{as part of the}} Fens Waterways Link project, which includes plans for improving the route through the Middle Levels from Stanground to Salters Lode and to Welches Dam.|$|E
5|$|Disaster {{occurred}} on Lady Day 1644, when an exceptionally high tide flooded the Upper Levels, and {{broke through the}} walls of the New Salt Channel. The Commissioners authorised {{the construction of a new}} sea <b>sluice</b> at Kent Wall, and work began in May 1646, but in September, they decided that it should be built at Blackwall instead. The height of Knelle Dam was regularly adjusted, in an attempt to manage the amount of water that still flowed along the Appledore Channel, and the conflicting needs of navigation and drainage. The Great Freshwater <b>Sluice</b> below Appledore deteriorated, and failed in 1650. A new <b>sluice</b> with three channels was built in 1669. The financial burden on the Upper Levels as a result of the sea entering the Wittersham Levels was huge, as they had to pay rent on all land that was not available to its original owners, and so in 1671, an agreement was reached that the sea would be excluded from the levels. Work began in 1680 to enclose areas of land on both sides of the valley, and was largely completed by 1684. The work included a new embanked channel for the Rother, which was built along the southern edge of the valley. It was called the Craven Channel, and ended at Craven Sluices.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to current {{advances in the}} cross-linguistic variation of syntactic contexts that allow <b>sluicing.</b> We investigate a relatively rare <b>sluicing</b> strategy: TP-ellipsis inside relative clauses.

5|$|Five sets of <b>sluices</b> and two weirs {{are used}} to control the canal's depth. The <b>sluices,</b> located at Mode Wheel Locks, Barton Locks, Irlam Locks, Latchford Locks and Weaver <b>Sluices,</b> are {{designed}} to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length in a controlled manner. Each consists {{of a set of}} mechanically driven vertical steel roller gates, supported by masonry piers. Originally, manually operated Stoney <b>Sluices</b> were used; these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s. The <b>sluices</b> are protected against damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers. Stop logs can be inserted by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver <b>Sluices,</b> accessed by boat, this task is performed by a floating crane.|$|R
5|$|In 1723, the Commissioners of the Kent and Sussex Rother Levels {{employed}} the civil engineering contractor John Reynolds to make repairs to Scots Float <b>Sluice,</b> a timber {{lock on the}} lower river. He built a dovetailed sheet pile wall below the foundations, and the Commissioners offered him the job of maintaining the levels in 1725, for which he would be paid £65 per year. He moved to Iden and held the post for fourteen years. Silting of the river estuary caused mounting problems with the drainage of the levels during the 1720s. Reynolds carried out further work on the <b>sluice</b> in 1729, and in 1732 reconstructed it to provide an extra outlet. Several new channels were excavated through the levels in the early 1730s, {{so that all the}} runoff passed through Scots Float. Reynolds resigned his post in 1739 as he was too busy with other engineering projects.|$|E
5|$|Once the Act of Parliament was obtained, Edwards {{became the}} {{engineer}} for the project, and drew up the detailed plans, which Grundy and Smeaton checked and altered slightly, {{after which they}} had no further involvement with the scheme. Construction was started in April 1763, and the drainage element of the project, which included the <b>sluice,</b> was finished in 1768, having cost £42,000. Work on three locks and other work connected with navigation cost £6,000 and continued until 1771. The locks were located at Stamp End, Kirkstead and Barlings. The Grand <b>Sluice</b> was a major construction which maintained the height of water above Boston to near normal high tide level and had massive flood gates to cope with any tides above this. It was completed in 1766 and was effective in scouring the Haven below it and increasing silting of the river above it.|$|E
5|$|Several {{years ago}} the {{government}} built <b>sluice</b> gates for the silt fertilization method, though many people disagreed with the plan. In spite of all opposition it was carried through, yet it had little success. When the torrents on Fan Shan were abundant, the gates were kept closed, and this caused damage (by flooding) of fields, tombs, and houses. When the torrents subsided in the late autumn the sluices were opened, and thus the fields were irrigated with silt-bearing water, but the deposit was not as thick as what the peasants call 'steamed cake silt' (so they were not satisfied). Finally the government got tired of it and stopped. In this connection I remember reading the Jiayipan of Bai Juyi (the poet) in which {{he says that he}} once had a position as Traffic Commissioner. As the Bian River was getting so shallow that it hindered the passage of boats he suggested that the <b>sluice</b> gates along the river and canal should be closed, but the Military Governor pointed out that the river was bordered on both sides by fields which supplied army grain, and if these were denied irrigation (water and silt) because of the closing of the <b>sluice</b> gates, it would lead to shortages in army grain supplies. From this I learnt that in the Tang period there were government fields and <b>sluice</b> gates {{on both sides of the}} river, and that irrigation was carried on (continuously) even when the water was high. If this could be done (successfully) in old times, why can it not be done now? I should like to enquire further about the matter from experts.|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} of <b>sluiced</b> prepositional phrases reveals <b>sluices</b> which cannot be interpreted via parallelism with an antecedent.

5|$|The Rasi Salai Dam was {{completed}} in 1994, {{around the same time}} as the Pak Mun Dam, and received similar local complaints. The dam's central reservoir was occupied for two years by villagers, until a July 2000 decision opened the <b>sluice</b> gates. From 2003 to 2004, Living River Siam coordinated Thai Baan research in three districts: Amphoe Rasi Salai, Amphoe Rattanaburi, and Amphoe Phon Sai. The report examined village culture, ecology, biodiversity, agriculture, and food and water management. The impact of the closing and opening of the <b>sluice</b> gates was also examined. It was concluded that the dam reduced fish populations, but more importantly, flooded natural salt pits and spread them into rice and vegetable fields, destroying trees and crops. The government has not made a commitment to keep the Rasi Salai Dam out of commission, but as of 2008 the gates have not yet been closed.|$|E

50|$|In syntax, <b>sluicing</b> {{is a type}} of {{ellipsis}} {{that occurs}} in both direct and indirect interrogative clauses.

5|$|The main {{job of the}} Drain is {{to gather}} the waters pumped from the Kesteven Fens, the Holland Fens and the Weir Dyke, a soak dike in Bourne North Fen, {{alongside}} the Bourne Eau and River Glen, northwards and eastwards to the Black <b>Sluice</b> at Boston, where they are discharged to the tidal waters of The Haven. The Weir Dyke {{takes its name from}} a weir in the bank of the Bourne Eau at Tongue End, which was constructed by the Black <b>Sluice</b> Commissioners, to allow water from the Bourne Eau to overflow the bank when excess water could not flow into the River Glen in times of flood. The overfall weir became redundant when the Tongue End pumping station was constructed in 1966.|$|E

40|$|Restricted until 25 April 2009. This {{dissertation}} is a generative-grammatical {{study of}} the constructions called <b>sluicing</b> and stripping in Japanese. It argues for the thesis, advocated by Hoji & Li (1994) and Fukaya & Hoji (1999), that <b>sluicing</b> and stripping are manifestations of the same syntactic phenomenon in Japanese, i. e., that their derivations involve {{the same set of}} formal operations. In order to establish the thesis, this dissertation investigates significantly more involved empirical materials pertaining to island sensitivity and the availability of the sloppy identity reading than previous studies of these constructions.; Chapters 2 and 3 examine the properties of <b>sluicing</b> and stripping in Japanese with respect to island sensitivity. Chapters 4 and 5 investigate their properties with respect to the availability of the sloppy identity reading. It is demonstrated in these four chapters that Japanese <b>sluicing</b> and stripping exhibit the same set of properties in regard to these two aspects. It is then claimed that ellipsis resolution in the case-marked versions of <b>sluicing</b> and stripping involves Constituent Raising in the "antecedent" IP and the copying of the resulting IP onto the ellipsis site. It is also claimed that ellipsis resolution in their non-case-marked counterparts, by contrast, does not necessarily involve such operations and that the copula structure is also a possibility for them. Chapter 6 then argues that the alternative accounts that analyze <b>sluicing</b> as analogous to wh-questions in English cannot capture the clear parallelism between <b>sluicing</b> and stripping demonstrated in the preceding chapters and also that stripping and, as a result, <b>sluicing</b> cannot be reduced to the cleft construction, contrary to what has sometimes been proposed in the literature. This chapter also discusses some implications of the present analysis for English <b>sluicing</b> and fragments. Chapter 7 summarizes the thesis and addresses some outstanding issues...|$|R
