2500|$|Pedro Ximénez (also {{known as}} PX {{and many other}} variations) {{is the name of}} a white Spanish wine grape variety grown in several Spanish wine regions but most notably in the Denominación de Origen (DO) of Montilla-Moriles. Here it is used to produce a varietal wine, an {{intensely}} sweet, dark, dessert sherry. [...] It is made by drying the grapes under the hot sun, concentrating the sweetness (similar to <b>straw</b> <b>wine</b> production), which are then used to create a thick, black liquid with a strong taste of raisins and molasses that is fortified and aged in solera.|$|E
2500|$|Both Hesiod's {{writings}} and Homer's Odyssey {{include some of}} the earliest mentions of <b>straw</b> <b>wine</b> production: laying out freshly harvested grapes on mats to dry nearly to raisins before pressing. A wine made on Lesbos known as protropon was among the first known to be made exclusively from [...] "free-run juice," [...] drawn from grape clusters expressing their contents under their own weight. Other Greek innovations include the harvest of deliberately unripe grapes in producing a more acidic wine for blending. The boiling of grape must was discovered as another means of adding sweetness to the wine. The Greeks believed wine could also be improved by adding resin, herbs, spice, seawater, brine, oil and perfume. Retsina, mulled wine and vermouth are some modern examples of these practices.|$|E
50|$|<b>Straw</b> <b>wines</b> are {{typically}} sweet to very sweet white wines, similar in density and sweetness to Sauternes {{and capable of}} long life. The low yields and labour-intensive production method means that they are quite expensive. Around Verona red grapes are dried, and are fermented in two different ways to make a dry red wine (Amarone) and a sweet red wine (Recioto della Valpolicella).|$|R
50|$|Bianco- The DOC of Greco di Bianco {{is one of}} the few {{predominant}} {{white wine}} regions in Calabria. The area produces most sweet wine from the Greco bianco grape that have alcohol contents of at least 17%. The wines are typically produced as <b>straw</b> <b>wines</b> with the grapes being partially dried prior to pressing and fermentation. Greco di Bianco is characterized by a deep amber color and aromas of citrus and herbs.|$|R
2500|$|They {{were capable}} of {{planning}} vineyards according to favorable climate and topography, such as which side of a slope was most ideal for grape growing, and producing {{a wide variety of}} different wine styles ranging from <b>straw</b> <b>wines</b> made from dried grapes to an early example of the modern Greek wine retsina, made with pine resin as an ingredient. The Phoenicians also spread the use of amphoras (often known as the [...] "Canaanite jar") for the transport and storage of wine.|$|R
2500|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, Vin Santo {{was often}} sold as basic vino da tavola due to Italian wine authorities' {{difficulties}} in classifying the many different styles of the wine. Today {{most of the major}} Italian wine producing regions have their own DOCs for specific Vin Santo wines produced in those areas. While the style is traditionally associated with Tuscany, examples {{can be found on the}} international wine market from throughout Italy. In the Trentino region, a dried <b>straw</b> <b>wine</b> made from the Nosiola grape is popularly labelled as Vino Santo. A noticeable difference between the Trentino and Tuscan examples is that the Trentino wines are usually less oxidised due to the wines regularly being [...] "topped up" [...] to prevent a large ullage.|$|E
2500|$|Pedro Ximénez is {{most widely}} grown in Spain {{where there were}} [...] of the grape in {{cultivation}} as of 2008. The vast majority of these plantings {{are found in the}} Spanish wine region of Montilla-Moriles where the grapes are used to make fortified Sherry-style wines labelled as PX. After harvest the Pedro Ximénez grapes are traditionally laid out on mats to further desiccate and dry in the sun (in a style similar to <b>straw</b> <b>wine</b> production). The high sugar and low acid wine made from these pressings may be fortified or not, depending on winemaker style, but will usually be very sweet and have a strong aroma and flavor of raisins. The wine may also be aged in a solera, similar to Sherry, with the age of the solera often stated on the wine label. Additionally, some Pedro Ximénez grapes are used as sweetening agents for other wines made in the Montilla-Moriles region.|$|E
2500|$|Other, likely apocryphal, {{stories on}} the name's origin {{attributes}} its naming {{to the work of}} a 14th-century friar from the province of Siena who would use the leftover wine from Mass to cure the sick. The miraculous healing became associated with the santo or [...] "holy" [...] wine and the name [...] "Vin Santo" [...] was allegedly born. Another 15th century story involving John Bessarion, a patriarch of the Greek Eastern Orthodox Church. According to legend at the Ecumenical Council of Florence of 1439 a local Florentine wine called Vin Pretto (pure wine) was served. After trying the wine, Bessarion is said to have liked the wine and remarked that it was like Xanthos, alluding to the famous <b>straw</b> <b>wine</b> of Thrace, (though some sources said he described the wine as Xantho or [...] "yellow"). The Florentine locals thought they heard the patriarch describe the wine as Santo and they accordingly started promoting the wine as a [...] "holy wine". Another theory for the name association often touted is the tradition of starting fermentation around All Saint's Day and bottling the wine during Easter week.|$|E
50|$|Drupeggio is a {{mid to late}} {{ripening}} grape variety. With relatively thick skins for a white grape variety, Druppeggio berries {{tend not}} to raisin very easily which makes it use {{in the production of}} passito or <b>straw</b> <b>wines,</b> such as Vin Santo, very rare even though it is a permitted variety in several DOCs for the dessert wine.

50|$|Throughout history, the {{vineyard}} and the Steinwein produced {{here have been}} noted in various texts and literary work. The German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in particular, described the wine {{as one of his}} favorites and wrote many lines praising its quality. In the 1840s {{the vineyard}} was visited by French wine writer André Jullien who described the sweet Steinwein from Würzburger Stein as being very potent and liable to cause violent headaches if too much was consumed. Jullien went on to describe that the strength and sweetness of the wines from Würzburger weren't necessarily the result of late harvest picking but rather from the post-harvest practice of drying the grapes out on mats prior to fermentation—making them essentially vins de paille or <b>straw</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Vin Santo [...] or Vino Santo [...] ("holy wine") is a {{style of}} Italian dessert wine. Traditional in Tuscany, these wines are often made from white grape {{varieties}} such as Trebbiano and Malvasia, though Sangiovese {{may be used to}} produce a rosé style known as [...] "Occhio di Pernice" [...] or eye of the partridge. The wines may also be described as <b>straw</b> <b>wines</b> since they are often produced by drying the freshly harvested grapes on straw mats in a warm and well ventilated area of the house. However several producers dry the grapes by hanging on racks indoors. Though technically a dessert wine, the wines can vary in sweetness levels from bone dry (like a Fino Sherry) to extremely sweet. While the style is believed to have originated in Tuscany, examples of Vin Santo can be found throughout Italy and is an authorised style of wine for several Denominazione di origine controllata (DOCs) and Indicazione geografica tipica (IGTs).|$|R

5000|$|A {{dried grape}} wine {{known as the}} Cypriot Manna was {{described}} in 800 BC by the Greek poet Hesiod. Similar principles were {{used to make the}} medieval Cypriot wine Commandaria, which is still produced today. Various Mediterranean raisin wines were described in the first century AD by Columella and Pliny the Elder. Pliny uses the Greek term for honey wine for the following raisin wine, [...] "The grapes are left on the vine to dry in the sun...It is made by drying grapes in the sun, and then placing them for seven days in a closed place upon hurdles, some seven feet from the ground, care being taken to protect them at night from the dews: on the eighth day they are trodden out: this method, it is said, produces a liquor of exquisite bouquet and flavour. The liquor known as melitites {{is also one of the}} sweet wines." [...] Columella discusses the Passum wine made in ancient Carthage. The modern Italian name for this wine, passito, echoes this ancient word, as does the French word used to describe the process of producing <b>straw</b> <b>wines,</b> passerillage. Perhaps the closest thing to passum is Moscato Passito di Pantelleria from Zibibbo, a variety of the ancient muscat grape, produced on Pantelleria, an island in the Strait of Sicily (50 miles from Tunisia) opposite to where Carthage used to be.|$|R

40|$|In Romania, Dornfelder {{is a rare}} grape variety {{which started}} to become popular among some wine {{producers}} due to the intense colour of its wines. However, it is mostly used in blends and therefore varietal wines of Dornfelder are not found too often. In this paper we present some technological approaches suitable {{for the production of}} varietal wines of Dornfelder, some of them novel for the Romanian wine industry. The experimental samples include a classical red wine made by the usual technol- ogy using freshly harvested grapes (DW = Dornfelder wine) and two variants made with dried grapes (DR and DWDR). The DR variant (Dornfelder raisin wine) is produced by a straw-wine type technology, by fermenting a must obtained from grapes dried for 7 weeks. The DWDR is a variant obtained by fermenting a mixture of crushed dried grapes and new Dornfelder wine, the ratio of crushed raisins to wine being 1 : 1 in weight. The wines were analysed both physico-chemically and sensorially. After one year of aging in bottles, the variant DWDR of wine, produced by fermenting dried berries in already finished wine, proved to be the most balanced in taste, with an intense and complex aroma of berries and red fruit, also displaying good aging potential and stability. The variant DR appeared dense and intense, but with a less complex fruity aroma, with a dominant note of blueberries and black currants. Both <b>straw</b> <b>wines</b> are preferable to the classic varietal wine, which is vinous, but lacks structure and displays a dissociated acidity and a simple aromatic profile, with dominant sour cherry, mineral and vegetal notes...|$|R

This is an indication that the combination of the fruits served as a good substrate for wine production with pawpaw and banana being the most efficient as shown in this study. The good aroma obtained in the wines could be attributed to high alcohol content in accordance with the report of Clement-Jimenez et al. (2005).|$|R

Due {{to the particular}} characteristics of the noble rotted grape, these wines (eg, Tokaji Aszú, Sauternes, Trockenbeerenauslese types, etc) have many characteristic features, including higher or lower residual sugar content and unique aroma composition. The technology, biochemistry, and special characteristics of botrytized wines have been researched for a long time. This review outlines the main directions of the current studies, giving a brief overview on the recent findings. Beside the traditional wine types, noble rot is increasingly utilized in making newer sweet <b>wine</b> styles and <b>straw</b> (passito) <b>wines,</b> which generates a series of new interesting experimental results. The fungus–grape interactions during the noble rot, the induced botrytization, the microbial communities of botrytized wines, and the volatile compounds having key roles in the distinct aroma of these wine styles are being focused on in the current studies in this field.
