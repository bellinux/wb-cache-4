25|$|The {{position}} of the equilibrium in the carbamate formation/decomposition depends on {{the product of the}} partial pressures of the reactants. In the total recycle processes, carbamate decomposition is promoted by reducing the overall pressure, which reduces the partial pressure of both ammonia and carbon dioxide. It is possible, however, to achieve a similar effect without lowering the overall pressure—by suppressing the partial pressure of just one of the reactants. Instead of feeding carbon dioxide gas directly to the reactor with the ammonia, as in the total recycle process, the stripping process first routes the carbon dioxide through a stripper (a carbamate decomposer that operates under full <b>system</b> <b>pressure</b> and configured to provide maximum gas-liquid contact). This flushes out free ammonia, reducing its partial pressure over the liquid surface and carrying it directly to a carbamate condenser (also under full <b>system</b> <b>pressure).</b> From there, reconstituted ammonium carbamate liquor passes directly to the reactor. That eliminates the medium-pressure stage of the total recycle process altogether.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented into how negative <b>system</b> <b>pressures,</b> {{the degree of}} aeration, and gutter water levels {{are affected by the}} number of outlets in a siphonic roof drainage system. The experimental results show that <b>system</b> <b>pressures</b> decrease if outlets are blocked. It is also shown that the depth of water above an outlet is strongly influenced by the negative pressure acting at the outlet. As the suction effect at the outlet increases, due to lower <b>system</b> <b>pressures,</b> more water and air will be drawn into the outlets and this will result in a corresponding increase in overall gutter water depth. The results also show that there is often built-in redundancy in multiple outlet siphonic systems experiencing lower-intensity rainfall events, and if one or two outlets were blocked, the system would still operate satisfactorily. A new outlet suppressor was trialled and this was shown to reduce gutter water levels by up to 58 % at some positions in the gutter. ...|$|R
25|$|An open {{pressurized}} system such as {{an automobile}} air conditioner can be more susceptible to leak its operating gases. Open systems rely on lubricant in the system to splash on pump components and seals. If it is not operated frequently enough, the lubricant on the seals slowly evaporates, and then the seals begin to leak until the system is no longer functional and must be recharged. By comparison, a hermetic system can sit unused for years, and can usually be started up again at any time without requiring maintenance or experiencing any loss of <b>system</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E

The system can be permanently placed on a ship or ocean platform, but is more commonly capable of being moved from one vessel to another by crane. The entire system is managed from a control room (van), where depth, chamber atmosphere and other system parameters are monitored and controlled. The diving bell is the elevator or lift that transfers divers from the system to the work site. Typically, it is mated to the system utilizing a removable clamp and is separated from the system tankage bulkhead by a trunking space, a kind of tunnel, through which the divers transfer {{to and from the}} bell. At the completion of work or a mission, the saturation diving team is decompressed gradually back to atmospheric pressure by the slow venting of <b>system</b> <b>pressure,</b> at rates of about of 15 to 30msw (50 to 100fsw) per day, (schedules vary). Thus the process involves only one ascent, thereby mitigating the time-consuming and comparatively risky process of multiple decompressions normally associated with non-saturation ("bounce diving") operations. The chamber gas mixture is typically controlled to maintain a nominally constant partial pressure of oxygen of between 0.3 and 0.5 bar during most of the decompression (0.44 to 0.48bar on US Navy schedule), which is below the upper limit for long term exposure. NOAA has used rather different saturation decompression schedules for relatively shallow (less than 100fsw) air and nitrox saturation dives, which use oxygen breathing when pressure is reduced to less than 55fsw.|$|E

2500|$|Because the urea {{conversion}} is incomplete, {{the product}} must {{be separated from}} unchanged ammonium carbamate. In early [...] "straight-through" [...] urea plants this was done by letting down the <b>system</b> <b>pressure</b> to atmospheric to let the carbamate decompose back to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Originally, {{because it was not}} economic to recompress the ammonia and carbon dioxide for recycle, the ammonia at least would be used for the manufacture of other products, for example ammonium nitrate or sulfate. (The carbon dioxide was usually wasted.) Later process schemes made recycling unused ammonia and carbon dioxide practical. This was accomplished by depressurizing the reaction solution in stages (first to 18–25 bar and then to 2–5 bar) and passing it at each stage through a steam-heated carbamate decomposer, then recombining the resultant carbon dioxide and ammonia in a falling-film carbamate condenser and pumping the carbamate solution into the previous stage.|$|E
2500|$|The nominal {{temperature}} of the cooling water at the inlet of the reactor is about [...] and the outlet temperature , at pressure in the drum separator of [...] The pressure and the inlet temperature determine the height at which the boiling begins in the reactor; if the coolant temperature is not sufficiently below its boiling point at the <b>system</b> <b>pressure,</b> the boiling starts {{at the very bottom}} part of the reactor instead of its higher parts. With few absorbers in the reactor core, such as during the Chernobyl accident, the positive void coefficient of the reactor makes the reactor very sensitive to the feedwater temperature. Bubbles of boiling water lead to increased power, which in turn increases the formation of bubbles. After 1986 absorbers were introduced in the fuel assembly, permanently assuring a negative void coefficient at the cost of higher enrichment requirements of the uranium fuel.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{pressure}} in the primary system continued to decrease, reactor coolant continued to flow, but it was boiling inside the core. First, small bubbles of steam formed and immediately collapsed, known as nucleate boiling. As the <b>system</b> <b>pressure</b> decreased further, steam pockets began to form in the reactor coolant. This {{departure from nucleate boiling}} (DNB) into the regime of [...] "film boiling" [...] caused steam voids in coolant channels, blocking the flow of liquid coolant and greatly increasing the fuel cladding temperature. The overall water level inside the pressurizer was rising despite the loss of coolant through the open pilot-operated relief valve, as the volume of these steam voids increased much more quickly than coolant was lost. Because of the lack of a dedicated instrument to measure the level of water in the core, operators judged the level of water in the core solely by the level in the pressurizer. Since it was high, they assumed that the core was properly covered with coolant, unaware that because of steam forming in the reactor vessel, the indicator provided misleading readings. Indications of high water levels contributed to the confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop [...] "going solid," [...] (i.e. no steam pocket buffer existing in the pressurizer) which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a loss-of-coolant accident, and led operators to turn off the emergency core cooling pumps, which had automatically started after the pilot-operated relief valve stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.|$|E
