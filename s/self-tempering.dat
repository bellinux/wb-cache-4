50|$|In 1986, slit rolling was {{introduced}} to Hadeed's Rolling Mills, increasing the daily production record by more than 21%. In 1987, a scrap car shredder plant was commissioned. With a capacity of 50 tonnes per hour, it shreds cars into pieces small enough to be charged into the electric arc furnaces. In 1988, Hadeed introduced a new technology (Bar Quenching) to its rolling mills in Jubail for the manufacture of concrete reinforcing bars. This process involves high pressure surface quenching followed by <b>self-tempering.</b> As the bar emerges from the last rolling stand, the surface temperature is rapidly reduced by high pressure water jets. This action causes change in the microstructure of the steel, making it harder and stronger. Subsequently the heat retained in the core dissipates out and heats the surface to around 620 °C causing another change in the microstructure, which improves the ductility and toughness of the bar. This process can meet increasing demands from structural engineers for higher yield strength combined with good ductility and weldability in reinforcing steel to reduce construction costs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The present work {{deals with}} a new method, {{technology}} and equipment developed for “in depth surface hardening ” of large rotary details and tools, made of constructional, carbon, alloyed or low-alloyed tool steels. According to the technical requirements the details and tools have to possess hardened layer with specific shape, depth in the range 20 - 35 mm and surface hardness of 35 - 62 HRC. The “in-depth hardening ” was performed by quenching and <b>self-tempering.</b> Preliminary volume heating and depth regulated local surface adjustable gas-flame heating were used. The gas-flame heating was realized by gas-flame burners (CH 4 +O 2) located near the details ’ periphery, depending on the shape and depth of the hardened layer. The burners ’ power and heating time were adjustable. The cooling was performed by showers located near the details ’ periphery also depending on {{the shape of the}} hardened layer. Water or polymer water solution was used as cooling media and its capacity was adjusted in the beginning. Due to the heat accumulated during the preliminary heating and the heating up to the quenching temperature of the surface layer, after stopping the cooling, subsequent <b>self-tempering</b> was applied. All of the equipment for realizing the whole hardening cycle, temperature and time control and parameters of heating and cooling was developed. Series of different details were hardened: traversing wheels and gears, forming rolls, rolling disks etc., made of construction and tool steels. The hardened layers obtained were with specific shape, surface hardness in the range of 35 - 60 HRC and depth of the hardened layer of 15...|$|E
50|$|Modern {{reinforcing}} bar of 500 MPa strength {{can be made}} from expensive microalloyed steel or by a quench and <b>self-temper</b> (QST) process. After the bar exits the final rolling pass, where the final shape of the bar is applied, the bar is then sprayed with water which quenches the outer surface of the bar. The bar speed and the amount of water are carefully controlled in order to leave the core of the bar unquenched. The hot core then tempers the already quenched outer part, leaving a bar with high strength but with a certain degree of ductility too.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecent {{papers have}} shown that {{bainitic}} ferrite plates can be produced by transformation at low temperatures, resulting in enhanced mechanical properties of martensitic steels and increased resistance to tempering. To that end, experimental investigations were performed on {{the formation of the}} microstructure in SAE 9254 steel during isothermal heat-treatment below the martensite start (Ms) temperature. After the isothermal heat-treatment, the same steel was subjected to tempering at various temperatures. Vickers microhardness measurements were performed on the isothermally heat-treated and tempered samples, and microhardness values for the samples were compared with those for quenched and tempered samples of the same steel. All the isothermally treated samples contained the martensite (αμ), bainitic ferrite (αb), and retained austenite (γr) phases. The retained austenite blocks (γb) decomposed in the samples tempered at 400 °C. A significant decrease in the microhardness value for the sample heat-treated at 270 °C can only be observed after the sample was tempered at 450 °C, because bainite was the predominant phase in the microstructure, which <b>self-tempers</b> as it forms...|$|R
40|$|Due to some {{unexpected}} structural damages in past major earthquakes, {{the challenge to}} improve building design codes, fabrication practice and material properties remains ever present. In seismic areas, structural steel plays traditionally a key-role as building material due to its unprecedented favorable mechanical properties. To defend and extend this preeminent position, steel shapes with higher strength, better toughness and improved fabrication properties have been developed and are readily available. This paper presents the physical and mechanical properties of shapes in ASTM A 913 Grade 50 and Grade 65, which are produced by an advanced thermo-mechanical controlled process, namely Quenching and <b>Self-Tempering</b> (QST). This process allows even for very thick structural shapes to combine three important but formerly incompatible properties: high strength, good toughness and easy weldability. As such, a characterization of A 913 steels ’ outstanding weldability, toughness, ductility and through-thickness properties are described...|$|E
40|$|Effect {{of plastic}} {{processing}} and controlled cooling on microstructure and mechanical properties of experimental steel grades with microalloyed with Ti, V and/or Nb, varying {{in the content}} of Mo is presented as an offer for mining industry for replacement traditionally heat-treatable hardenability grades. The goal of the work is producing microstructure condition, which after controlled hot forging and direct heat treatment, involving quenching and <b>self-tempering,</b> are meant to provide good combination of mechanical properties, such as TYS 800 MPa, UTS 1050 MPa, elongation to fracture at least A 5 15 % and/or impact strength at room temperature KCV 60 J/cm 2. Hardenability assessment and dilatometric examination allowed formulation of direct heat treatment guidelines, taking into consideration fields of temperature and strain in a typical hot forging process, estimated numerically, with the use of plastometric tests results, as well as the use of unique cooling cycles after forging...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the potential of using a quench and <b>self-tempering</b> heat treatment process with AISI 1117 steel to satisfy the mechanical properties of ASTM A 706 rebar. A series of quenching tests were performed and the resulting microstructure and mechanical properties studied using optical microscopy, microhardness measurement, and tensile tests. The presence of martensite throughout the samples contributed to the enhanced strength and strain-hardening ratio (tensile to yield strength) of the material. The experimental results showed that AISI 1117 is capable of meeting the ASTM standard. In addition to the experiments, a computer model using the finite difference method and incorporating heat transfer and microstructure evolution was developed to assist in future optimization of the heat treatment process. iii Acknowledgments First, I {{would like to thank}} my supervisor Professor Zhirui Wang for his invaluable guidance and technical insight throughout this endeavor.
