Tickets for the first show were made available to members of Madonna's official fan club, Icon, and were non-transferable, with the person's name printed on them.|$|E

[...] David Milner for Digital Spy also gave positive thoughts on the season, saying [...] "When it's not fulfilling its duties as a Marvel-licensed product, Luke Cage is basically a précis of the last 100 years of African-American history – especially in relation to Harlem itself." [...] Conversely, Milner felt Ali's Cottonmouth was not [...] "as imposing a figure as Daredevils Wilson Fisk and isn't nearly as darkly charismatic as David Tennant's Kilgrave from Jessica Jones." [...] Maureen Ryan of Variety felt Luke Cage [...] "has a more than adequate supply of pleasures", with the cast strong enough to [...] "power" [...] the season [...] "through its rough spots, which include a somewhat clunky pilot and a notable tendency to sprawl". She also felt that [...] "Where the drama tends to stumble is in meandering expositional scenes, which quite often go on too long and drain the show of momentum... when [...] can’t make a long dialogue scene work, the problem is in the writing, not the performances." [...] Merrill Barr, writing for Forbes, called the season [...] "another winner for Marvel and Netflix that shouldn’t be missed," [...] saying, [...] "Arcs are beautifully handled, often taking zigs when a zag is not only expected but often encouraged. Fans of the characters are going to rejoice at the level of quality they are getting with this one after waiting <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>for</b> Cage to be realized in live action, and fans of Marvel in general should really enjoy the 70s stylings that shake things up real well." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 1, 2013, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett {{announced}} he would sue the NCAA in federal court over the sanctions imposed on Penn State. [...] Although Corbett is an ex officio {{member of the board}} of trustees, Penn State was not involved in the suit. [...] According to the Associated Press, Corbett was filing an antitrust suit against the NCAA. Though Corbett had originally [...] "endorsed [...] as 'part of the corrective process'", [...] he and other Pennsylvania elected officials had more recently begun to object to the prospect of the $60 million fine being spent mostly outside of Pennsylvania. One reason given for the objection is that there is no legal way Penn State can ensure that taxpayer money won't be used to pay the fine. In sharply criticizing the governor's move in an editorial, The New York Times noted that the governor [...] "barely mentioned the young victims" [...] in his 2013 statement. It continued: [...] "In his complaints, the governor only confirmed the inquiry finding that the university’s obsession with football predominance helped drive the cover-up of Mr. Sandusky’s crimes." [...] It also noted that, in the suit, Corbett [...] "bypassed incoming state attorney general Kathleen Kane [...] in her election campaign last year ... promised to look into why it took <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>for</b> the pedophilia scandal to be investigated when Mr. Corbett previously served as attorney general". The Patriot-News said of the suit: [...] " [...] comes after a year of withering criticism of Corbett by some quarters of the Penn State community, which has seen the governor and his fellow PSU trustees as too quick to brand former head coach Joe Paterno and others as fall guys for the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal." [...] On June 6, 2013, federal Middle District Judge Yvette Kane said she could not [...] "find any factual allegations" [...] and threw out the lawsuit calling it [...] "a Hail Mary pass" [...] that easily warranted dismissal.|$|E
