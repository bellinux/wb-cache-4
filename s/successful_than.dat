Secondary data analysis was completed {{in order to test}} the following four interconnected tests of hypotheses: (1) Are students requesting <b>successful</b> schools more <b>than</b> unsuccessful schools? (2) Are students leaving less <b>successful</b> schools more <b>than</b> <b>successful</b> schools? (3) Are ethnic minorities requesting <b>successful</b> schools more <b>than</b> unsuccessful schools? (4) Are ethnic minorities transferring out of unsuccessful schools more <b>than</b> <b>successful</b> schools? Multiple regression was used to test 10 models per hypothesis (for a total of 40 models). Results from this analysis were mixed, but in most cases MCA test scores seemed to be a poor predictor of student requests and student transfers...|$|R

5|$|Budapest Tales {{was even}} less <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> 25 Fireman Street {{at the box}} office and festivals. According to author David Paul, this may explain why Szabó shifted gears even more {{dramatically}} in his next film, Confidence (1980), in which historical events are represented straightforwardly, and are filtered through neither memory nor allegory. The film focuses on the relationship between a man and woman who are forced to share a room as they hide from the Arrow Cross {{toward the end of the}} Second World War. It garnered a Best Director award for Szabó at the Berlin Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 53rd Academy Awards.|$|E

Writers who have worked at Ace include Frederik Pohl and Ellen Kushner.|$|E

Wilfrid became involved in the missionary efforts to the Frisians, which he had started in 678 during his stay in Frisia. Wilfrid helped the missionary efforts of Willibrord, which were more <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> his own earlier attempts. Willibrord was a monk of Ripon who was also a native of Northumbria.|$|E

Flann was more <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> most kings of Ireland. However, rather than the military and diplomatic successes of his reign, it is his propaganda statements, in the form of monumental high crosses naming him and his father, as kings of Ireland, that are exceptional.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's first {{possession}} of the half was slightly more <b>successful</b> <b>than</b> Wake Forest's, as the Yellow Jackets drove inside the Deacons' 30-yard line on several passes from Reggie Ball. Again, however, the Tech defense stumbled. Facing a fourth down inside the Wake Forest red zone, Tech elected to attempt to convert the first down rather than punt the ball. Despite needing just one yard to gain another first down, Georgia Tech was stopped short of the line. The play {{was typical of the}} third quarter, which saw both teams fail to score.|$|E
