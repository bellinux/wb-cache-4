A rigorous so-lution {{of the electromagnetic}} field for the case of underground con-ductors and a two-layer earth is presented. Analytic expressions for the self and mutual impedances of the cable are derived. The in-volved semi-infinite integrals are calculated by a novel, numerically stable, and efficient integration scheme. Typical <b>single-core</b> <b>cable</b> arrangements are examined for a combination of layer depths and earth resistivities, based on actual measurements.

In order to analyze transient heating of cables a daily load diagram with three levels, which can be described by two parameters is used. These parameters are duration of high level loading and load factor. In order to analyze daily temperature variation of the cable the ratio of high level current loading to rated current of the cable is also required. Parameters that affect results are varied in analysis: thermal conductivity and diffusivity of soil, the distance between adjacent cables, temperature of referent soil, cross-bonding of metal sheets, etc. The results of analysis are ranges of conductor temperature variation, i. e. daily minimum and maximum temperature of the conductor for different laying and ambient conditions.

A {{frequency domain analysis}} on several commercially-available LEDs was performed to investigate the signature of the harmonic current injected into the power system. Four-core cables and four <b>single-core</b> <b>cable</b> arrangements (three phases and neutral) of small, medium, and large conductor cross sections, with the neutral conductor cross section approximately equal to the half of the phase conductors, were examined. The cables were modelled by using electromagnetic finite-element analysis software. High harmonic power losses (up to 2. 5 times the value corresponding to an undistorted current of the same rms value of the first harmonic of the LED current) were found. A generalized ampacity model was employed for re-rating the cables. It {{was found that the}} cross section of the neutral conductor {{plays an important role in}} the derating of the cable ampacity due to the presence of a high-level of triplen harmonics in the distorted current. The ampacity of the cables should be derated by about 40 %, almost independent of the conductor cross sections.

40|$|Cable-series {{impedance}} modeling {{is widely}} applied in electromagnetic transients simulations and power-loss calculations. The calculations are usually {{performed in a}} 2 -D frame using the finite-element method or alternative approaches, such as MoM-SO, thereby losing the 3 -D effects imposed by twisting wire screens and armors. One {{of the implications of}} using 2 -D modeling for three-core and closely packed <b>single-core</b> <b>cables</b> is that currents will always circulate among the individual wires of each wire screen or armor.
