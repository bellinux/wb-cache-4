I think the Vatican's got {{more to talk about}} than the Beatles." [...] In its 14 April 2010 edition, L'Osservatore Romano responded to Starr's comments, stating that [...] "John Lennon had no need of forgiveness from the Vatican, L'Osservatore Romano reprinted its 1966 article on John Lennon's comments. The 1966 L'Osservatore Romano article noted that Lennon had apologised for his comments and that fellow Beatle Paul McCartney had criticized them." [...] In 2010, Starr said that he had now found religion, adding, [...] "For me, God is in my life... I think the search has been on since the 1960s." ...|$|E
500|$|After the war Beric {{became a}} clerk in the Gents clock factory. The family lived in a terraced house on Lead Street in the centre of Leicester, an area that was {{demolished}} in the mid-1950s {{as part of the}} city's slum clearance. When Icke was three, in around 1955, they moved to the Goodwood estate, one of the council estates the post-war Labour government built. [...] "To <b>say</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> skint," [...] he wrote in 1993, [...] "is like saying it is a little chilly at the North Pole." [...] He recalls having to hide under a window or chair when the council man came for the rent; after knocking, the rent man would walk around the house peering through windows. His mother never explained that it was about the rent; she just told Icke to hide. He wrote in 2003 that he still gets a fright when someone knocks on the door.|$|E
500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we can do it. In the past, {{there has been so}} much talk about our side and a lot of pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, people would come up to me in the street and <b>say</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E

500|$|Brewer told a Channel 5 website writer {{that the}} rain was the biggest {{challenge}} of the night shoot, as it was [...] "beyond freezing". She also revealed that she ran in shoes {{that she had not}} broken in and they made her feet bleed. The actress added [...] "It was incredibly stressful but I guess it was stress in a good way. There were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork. So I guess it was stressful in the sense the emotional stakes were heightened for a two-week period. It was exhausting and I think we can all <b>say</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> happy once it was over. But the final result was worth it." [...] McGregor filmed his final scene out of sequence at the Melbourne studios. He explained that they had already shot Mark's last scene on location, then went back inside to do the studio shots. He revealed [...] "The final thing I filmed was a conversation between Mark and Kyle, where they're saying goodbye. It was a bit sad, but it was basically just these two guys hugging each other – with the cast and crew watching!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The group's {{original}} goal {{of promoting}} Atlanticism, of strengthening U.S.–European relations and preventing another world war has grown; the Bilderberg Group's theme is to [...] "bolster a consensus around free market Western capitalism and its interests around the globe" [...] according to Andrew Kakabadse. In 2001, Denis Healey, a Bilderberg group founder and a steering committee member for 30 years, said, [...] "To <b>say</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair. Those {{of us in}} Bilderberg felt we couldn't go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless. So we felt that a single community throughout {{the world would be}} a good thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The group's ninth album overall, seventh for Columbia Records, {{and second}} {{released}} on the ARC label was I Am. It was another smash hit, going double Platinum and reaching numbers 3 and 1 on the R and Pop charts, respectively. Singles spawned from this album included [...] "In The Stone," [...] "Can't Let Go," [...] and the sad David Foster/Bill Champlin-written ballad [...] "After the Love Has Gone," [...] which {{rose to the}} number 2 spot on the Billboard Pop and R charts and won a Grammy for the Best R Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group in 1980. Though the band had previously overlooked disco, the summer of 1979 saw EWF topping the dance music charts with their most disco-inspired single, [...] "Boogie Wonderland," [...] which was produced by Maurice and Al McKay and featured The Emotions. (Its lyrics detail the down side of the discothèque genre and lifestyle.) Even with the song's success, Verdine White claims that the band is not a disco band, saying: [...] "I guess you could <b>say</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> at the party but didn’t get on the dance floor." ...|$|E

[...] Everhadus is our only hard driving back, while Minnesota has three, [...] [...] [...] Our other ball carriers depend on sidestepping to go places and they couldn't do much of that with the footing so slippery." [...] Kipke also praised his defense for their play after Minnesota drove to the 15-yard line: [...] "Fourth down and 12 yards to go didn't look bad at all. [...] Renner certainly meant business when he threw Alfonse for that six-yard loss." [...] The Wolverines played a defensive oriented game and relied heavily on Regeczi's punting. [...] One sports columnist wrote: [...] "No game I have seen this season more clearly brought out the inestimable value of consistent punting as did this bruise and batter struggle [...] [...] [...] [...] No matter where Michigan was located when Johnny Regeczi went back to kick, the boot almost always was good enough to place Minnesota on the defensive." ...|$|E
