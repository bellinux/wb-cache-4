Short-term hiatus periods of global warming are compatible with long-term climate change patterns. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) leads to multidecadal variability in Northern Hemispheric mean surface temperature by 15–20 years through a delayed effect on the North Atlantic Ocean, and can be a useful predictor of multidecadal periods of warming and cooling in both AMO and Northern Hemispheric mean surface temperature. A study published in January 2015 proposed that the hiatus resulted from a 60-year oscillatory pattern of natural variability <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> the AMO and PDO, interacting with a secular warming trend due mainly to human caused increases in greenhouse gas levels.|$|E

40|$|Regulated {{proteolysis}} is {{a powerful}} mechanism to rapidly adjust the cellular proteome to changing environmental conditions. In bacteria the energy-dependent degradation of proteins is mediated by the specific substrate recognition of AAA + proteases (A TPases a <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> various cellular a ctivities). While the protease FtsH is anchored to the inner membrane, Lon is a cytoplasmic protease. In Escherichia coli, FtsH e. g. controls the heat shock response and the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) through degradation of its substrates RpoH and LpxC. In this work (i) the substrate recognition of RpoH by FtsH, (ii) the conservation of regulation of LPS biosynthesis by proteolysis in different Gram-negative species and (iii) the substrate diversity of the FtsH protease were analyzed. Furthermore it was demonstrated that the replication inhibitor CspD is a substrate of the Lon protease in E. coli.

40|$|Abstract: Although {{previous}} research on the correlates of political repression has found a negative linear relationship between democracy and repression, we maintain that the relationship is more complex. We focus instead {{on the role of}} threats as a key precipitant to political repression and contend that scholars should attend to both non-linearities in analyses of political repression as well as Fein’s (1995) argument that states with intermediate levels of democracy (i. e. semidemocracies) are more likely to repress. Such an orientation leads us to hypothesize that there is an inverted U relationship between regime type and political repression. In this article we examine this relationship for 91 less developed countries over the period 1979 - 92. The findings support the thesis and indicate that (1) the level of threat is positively and significantl <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> political repression; (2) the level of threat has a greater impact than regime type on the likelihood of political repression; and (3) controlling for the level of threat, less developed states with intermediate levels of democracies—semi-democracies—have the highest levels of political repression...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{the use of}} {{probabilistic}} risk analysis techniques to quantitatively address variability and uncertainty in risks increased in popularity as recommended by the 1994 National Research Council that wrote Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment.

This paradigm shift away {{from the use of}} point estimates creates new challenges for risk managers, who now struggle with decisions about how to use distributions in decision-mak g. The challenges for risk communication, however, have only been minimally explored. This presentation uses the case studies of variability in the risks of dying on the ground from a crashing airplane and from the deployment of motor vehicle airbags to demonstrate how better characterization of variability and uncertainty in the risk assessment lead to better risk communication.

40|$|Estimating {{the impact}} of tourism on an economy means to {{estimate}} both benefits and costs a <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> tourism. Without any doubt, tourism has a huge economic and social importance.

The aim {{of this article is to}} make an approach to the environmental impact of tourism through an estimation of the waste generation from the consumption of non-residents. To satisfy the touristic final demand vector the economy needs to produce a range of goods and services. During this production we get not only goods but also physical waste that we return to the environment.

In this respect their behaviour resembled certain seabirds. The ichnological evidence for pterosaur 'swim ' and 'feeding ' traces consists of scrape marks interpreted as traces left when the paddling limb of a pter-osaur egistered on the substrate, and small circular paired epressions a traces left when the beak of a pterosaur was probing for food. Such traces resulting from aquatic activity are consistent with the nearshore environments in which pterosaur bones and trackways have been found. There is growing evidence for an extensive and complex Pteraichnus ichnofacies in the Late Jurassic of western North America; over 80 specimens have been collected with many more remain-ing in the field. In particular we draw attention to the large quantitative data base that is available for morphometric, size-frequency studies and the potential for behavioural studies of individual loco-motion and flocking.

40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy {{has been used to}} determine the composition of the aqueous phase of bovine chromaffin granules. Relative con-centrations of catecholamines (epinephrine plus norepinephrine), ATP and chromogranins have been measured from integrated intensities in the proton spectra using computer simulation techniques. Most or all of the catechol-amines (97 + 8 %) are present in the aqueous phase and contribute to the high resolution spectrum. The catecholamine:ATP molar ratio (4. 41 + _ 0. 45) deter-mined by NMR is close to the value (4. 45) derived from biochemical ssay indi-cating that most or all of the ATP is present with catecholamine in the aqueous phase. Catecholamine:protein ratios show that approximately 45 % of the soluble protein freed by lysis is not NMR visible.

We observed an increase of CXCR 5 + PD- 1 PD- 1 high CD 57 - Tfh and germinal center (GC) CD 57 + Tfh in HIV + spleens. Both subsets showed a reduced mRNA expression of the transcription factor STAT- 3, co-stimulatory, regulatory and signal transduction molecules as compared to HIV - spleens. Similarly, Foxp 3 expressing follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells were increased, suggesting sustained GC reactions in chronically HIV + spleens.

The aim of the cohort study was to evaluate the prognostic value of non-specific ST-T changes and LVH electrocardiographic criteria on cardiovascular events and mortality in hypertensive patients. Methods: A cohort study of 352 non-diabetic hypertensive patients, without associated cardiovascular disease, randomly selected from 1, 780 hypertensive patients atte nded in a primary care center. An electrocardiogram was performed at the baseline visit (classified according to the Minnesota Code). Cardiovascular events and death from any cause during the follow-up period were evaluate d. A multivariate analysis adjusted for gender, age and cardiovascular risk factors was performed. Results: Data of 273 patients were analyzed: 58. 2 % women, age 44. 1 (7. 9) years, 27. 8 % smokers, blood pressure at baseline 142. 7 (15. 3) / 89. 3 (9. 6) mmHg.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{filamentous}} fungus Sordaria macrospora forms complex three-dimensional fruiting bodies called perithecia that protect the developing ascospores and ensure their proper discharge. In previous microarray analyses, several genes {{have been identified}} that are downregulated in sterile mutants compared to the wild type. Among these genes was tap 1 (t ranscript a <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> p erithecial development), a gene encoding a putative lectin homolog. Results Analysis of tap 1 transcript levels in the wild type under conditions allowing only vegetative growth compared to conditions that lead to fruiting body development showed that tap 1 is not only downregulated in developmental mutants but is also upregulated in the wild type during fruiting body development. We have cloned and sequenced a 3. 2 kb fragment of genomic DNA containing the tap 1 open reading frame and adjoining sequences. The genomic region comprising tap 1 is syntenic to its homologous region in the closely related {{filamentous fungus}} Neurospora crassa. To determine whether tap 1 is involved in fruiting body development in S. macrospora, a knockout construct was generated in which the tap 1 open reading frame {{was replaced by the}} hygromycin B resistance gene hph under the control of fungal regulatory regions. Transformation of the S. macrospora wild type with this construct resulted in a tap 1 deletion strain where tap 1 had been replaced by the hph cassette. The knockout strain displayed no phenotypic differences under conditions of vegetative growth and sexual development when compared to the wild type. Double mutants carrying the Δ tap 1 allele in several developmental mutant backgrounds were phenotypically similar to the corresponding developmental mutant strains. Conclusion The tap 1 transcript is strongly upregulated during sexual development in S. macrospora; however, analysis of a tap 1 knockout strain shows that tap 1 is not essential for fruiting body formation in S. macrospora. </p...|$|E

In the mouse, it is a hetero-oligomer variably formed by the Spg 7, Afg 3 l 1, and Afg 3 l 2 encoded proteins, or a homo-oligomer formed by either Afg 3 l 1 or Afg 3 l 2. In humans, AFG 3 L 2 and SPG 7 genes are conserved, whereas AFG 3 L 1 became a pseudogene. Both AFG 3 L 2 and SPG 7 {{are involved in a}} neurodegenerative disease, namely the autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia SCA 28 and a recessive form of spastic paraplegia, respectively. Results Using quantitative RT-PCR, we measured the expression levels of Spg 7, Afg 3 l 1, and Afg 3 l 2 in the mouse brain. In all regions Afg 3 l 2 is the most abundant transcript, followed by Spg 7, and Afg 3 l 1, with a ratio of approximately 5 : 3 : 1 in whole-brain mRNA. Using in-situ hybridization, we showed that Spg 7, Afg 3 l 1 and Afg 3 l 2 have a similar cellular pattern of expression, with high levels in mitral cells, Purkinje cells, deep cerebellar nuclei cells, neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons, and brainstem motor neurons. However, in some neuronal types, differences in the level of expression of these genes were present, suggesting distinct degrees of contribution of their proteins. Conclusions Neurons involved in SCA 28 and hereditary spastic paraplegia display high levels of expression, but similar or even higher expression is also present in other types of neurons, not involved in these diseases, suggesting that the selective cell sensitivity should be attributed to other, still unknown, mechanisms. </p...|$|E

Though previous studies have detected several QTL's linked to these traits, their genetic basis is still intriguing. Hence, association mapping was employed in this study for CIMMYT's Stem Rust Resistance Screening Nursery wheat lines to identify Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) markers linked to Ltn and Pbc. Phenotyping for these traits was done in Ithaca, U. S. A. (Fall 2011); Njoro, Njoro (Summer and Fall 2012) and Wellington, India (Fall and Winter 2012). Using the Q + K matrix, 21 GBS markers were identified to be significantly associated with Ltn. While some of them were linked to loci where the durable leaf rust resistance genes Lr 34 (7 DS), Lr 46 (1 BL), Lr 67 (4 DL), Lr 68 (7 BL) were mapped, significant associations were also detected with loci previously known to interact with Lr 34 (2 BL and 5 B) and few other loci (3 BS, 3 D, 5 A and 7 BS).

In this context, fuorophores presenting electronic transitions of the “intramolecular charge transfer” (ICT) type are considered as a particularly appealing class of molecules. The peculiar linear (environmental sensitivity, olvatochromism) and nonlinear (two-photon absorption, second harmonic generation) spectroscopic properties <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> ICT transitions have been taken advantage of for the development of functional materials, including H orpolarity probesand biosensors with one or two-photon induced fuorescence. These fuorophores are inherently lipophilic, because of their extended conjugated carbon backbone. Thus, major efforts have been put into the improvement of their solubility in biological media and their biocompatibility. In this context, it has been shown by Müllen et al. that controlled growth of a star-shaped polymer shell around a central fuorophore is a particularly effective strategy. Moreover, we have recently provided proof of the principle that such structures are valuable candidates for the ectorization of twophoton fuorophores into cells. We showed that the resulting structures display good-to-very-good conservation of their twophoton brightness in aqueous media, with emission wavelengths up to 570 nm. This result was however not fully optimal for in vivo two-photon imaging applications, since it is desirable that the probe features maximal Fuorescence in the biological window, i. e. at a wavelength between 700 – 1000 nm. International audienceA water soluble Lemke chromophore derivative shows an unusual polarity dependence of its emission efficiency, leading to strong red-NIR fluorescence in water when fitted with appropriate water-solubilizing polymer chains. In this edge article, the synthesis of the chromophore is described. The dependence of its fluorescence on solvent polarity is investigated experimentally and rationalized on the basis of ab initio calculations. Finally, we demonstrate that this chromophore is a valuable candidate for in vivo two-photon imaging of cerebral vasculature, with two-photon absorption and emission in the biological transparency window...|$|E
40|$|This {{is a study}} {{concerning}} the result of sports sponsorship where the research focuses on how would a specific construct of Brand Equity would correlate with the sponsorship outcome. The study takes one of the forerunners of professional football (soccer) club as the object. Persib (Persatuan Sepakbola Indonesia Bandung), a football club which resides in Bandung. Persib {{has proven to be}} one of the most prominent football clubs in terms of business, fans, and professionalism. Each home game are watched by a minimum number of 40, 000 spectators, and the company itself, PT. PBB (Persib Bandung Bermartabat, Inc.) has managed to generate a yearly income of approx. 12 Billion Rupiahs, income which is considered as the largest from a professional football club in Indonesia. The study is aimed to discover how the construct of BETS (Brand Equity of Team Sports) would influence the Sponsorship Outcome. Questionnaires were distributed to 403 fans of Persib Bandung, whom are <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> Viking community. The study modifies the concept of Bauer, et al. (2005) that applies the concept of Consumer Based Brand Equity from Keller (1993), and also the concept of Sponsorship Outcome (SO) from Gwinner and Swanson (2003). BETS is divided into four dimension; Awareness, Product-Related Attributes, Non Product-Related Attributes, and Brand Benefits. For the football context, each dimension is measured according to the characteristics of a football club. Product-related attributes consists of Athletic success, star player(s), coach, and management. Sponsorship Outcome is measured by; Sponsor recognition, attitude toward sponsor, sponsor patronage, and satisfaction with sponsor. The research would focus on observing SO on the context of general sponsorship of Persib, Honda, and PT. Daya Adira Mustika. The concepts are modified by researcher to fit research context. This study introduces a simpler construct to measure BETS from earlier model of Bauer, et al. And empirical test prove research hypothesis that BETS significantly affect SO using SEM, and dimensions of BETS correlates with SO. Simpler dimensions of BETS proposed by this study can accurately measure BETS, and the research also concluded Honda as the top of mind sponsor of Persib...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{worldwide}} trend to increase axle loads and train speeds. This means that railway track degradation will be accelerated, and track maintenance costs will be increased significantly. There {{is a need to}} investigate the consequences of increasing traffic load. The aim of the research is to develop a model for the analysis of physical degradation of railway tracks in response to changes in traffic parameters, especially increased axle loads and train speeds. This research has developed an integrated track degradation model (ITDM) by integrating several models into a comprehensive framework. Mechanistic relationships for track degradation hav ?een used wherever possible in each of the models contained in ITDM. This overcc:mes the deficiency of the traditional statistical track models which rely heavily on historical degradation data, which is generally not available in many railway systems. In addition statistical models lack the flexibility of incorporating future changes in traffic patterns or maintenance practices. The research starts with reviewing railway track related studies both in Australia and overseas to develop a comprehensive understanding of track performance under various traffic conditions. Existing railway related models are then examined for their suitability for track degradation analysis for Australian situations. The ITDM model is subsequently developed by modifying suitable existing models, and developing new models where necessary. The ITDM model contains four interrelated submodels for rails, sleepers, ballast and subgrade, and track modulus. The rail submodel is for rail wear analysis and is developed from a theoretical concept. The sleeper submodel is for timber sleepers damage prediction. The submodel is developed by modifying and extending an existing model developed elsewhere. The submodel has also incorporated an analysis for the likelihood of concrete sleeper cracking. The ballast and subgrade submodel is evolved from a concept developed in the USA. Substantial modifications and improvements have been made. The track modulus submodel is developed from a conceptual method. Corrections for more global track conditions have been made. The integration of these submodels into one comprehensive package has enabled the interaction between individual track components to be taken into account. This is done by calculating wheel load distribution with time and updating track conditions periodically in the process of track degradation simulation. A Windows-based computer program <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> ITDM has also been developed. The program enables the user to carry out analysis of degradation of individual track components and to investigate the inter relationships between these track components and their deterioration. The successful implementation of this research has provided essential information for prediction of increased maintenance as a consequence of railway trackdegradation. The model, having been presented at various conferences and seminars, has attracted wide interest. It is anticipated that the model will be put into practical use among Australian railways, enabling track maintenance planning to be optimized and potentially saving Australian railway systems millions of dollars in operating costs...|$|E
40|$|The {{issues of}} {{environmental}} sustainability; fossil fuel use, resource use and pollution have {{until very recently}} remained a low priority to {{the vast majority of}} retail clients. The traditional barriers of capital cost, lack of precedent and perceived need have been replaced by the more urgent drivers of brand management and business risk. This emerging client need for more sustainable buildings requires that a methodology is adopted to enhance the end product for all stakeholders whilst avoiding possible criticism of "greenwash". However, despite the number of initiatives available, environmental analysis of retail projects in the UK have been limited to site environmental impact assessmenrte quired for planning approval and written sustainability statementss ubmitted as supporting information, and only required for large projects and at the discretion of the planning authority. These documents are rarely referred to once the planning stage has been passed and substitution of materials form routine cost saving measures through the Design and Build procurement route. Moreover, the layered nature of speculative development; where the client is a developer aiming to sell to an investor and the tenant is responsible for their own fit-out and plant, limits the level of innovation and continuity of thought between all stakeholders. This research was therefore conceived to address the need for an appropriate methodology to ensure that sustainability is considered in the design of retail facilities. The aim was to develop a framework methodology for incorporating sustainability in the design, construction and management of retail facilities. The following objectives were pursued: (a) To define the criteria of sustainability in architectureth roughl iteraturer eview; (b) to understandth e specific problemsa <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> sustainabilityi n retail architecturet hrough literature review, cases tudy interviews and survey data; (c) to assessth e extent to which existing tools satisfy the criteria for sustainability; (d) to develop a framework using the findings of the research through design and action research strategy and test the resulting framework though industry disseminationa ndh ypotheticacl ases tudies. 3 The results of the research outlined by the objectives above resulted {{in the development of a}} framework methodology. Using intuitive discursive analysis as the most readily adaptable process with the use of risk identification and mitigation as a design management technique, the resulting framework provides a matrix based documentation tool to facilitate development of the brief from the design of the facility, through procurement stages and providing a plan for sustainable management at handover of the facility to the client. The research concludes that improving the sustainability of retail facilities is a real possibility but that it is also dependant on client acceptance of responsibility to wider society and the environment. This research supports the need for a structured and integrated approach for design, development and delivery of retail facilities at all scales and how the interface between shell development and retail tenant is critical to real improvements in sustainability. The developed framework methodology requires further testing and refinement in a wider variety of applications to fully explore the potential benefits to be gained.

40|$|Background. The TNF {{receptor}} associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is an {{autosomal dominant}} autoinflammatory disease due to mutations within the TNFRSF 1 A gene that codify the TNF receptor 1. Clinically TRAPS patients have recurrent fever associated to myalgia, gastrointestinal symptomps, arthritis or arthralgia, pericarditits and conjuntival pains. The {{study of the}} pathophysiology of TRAPS has been fundamental to understand the mechanism of action of TNFR 1. Different mutations in the gene result in different aberrant functions of the protein that involve modification in the shedding or in protein folding or in intracellular signalling of TNFR 1. To date up to 100 mutations are found associated {{to the development of}} TRAPS. The majority of the mutation are located within Cisteinic Rich Domains (CRDs). They have a high penetrance as T 50 M and the phenotype is a typical TRAPS. There are other mutations that not involve the CRDs. they have a low penetrance and are <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> a variable phenotype as R 92 Q. Recently in our laboratory It was identify a novel mutation in TNFRSF 1 A gene that resulting in Pro for Ser aminoacid substitution at residue 59 of the mature protein (S 59 P) in adult TRAPS patient. Aims. The aim of this work is to study the effects of this mutation on signalling pathway of TNFR 1 and compare the results with whose obtained from high penetrance T 50 M and low penetrance R 92 Q mutation that are described in literature. Methods. Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK 293) cell line was stably transfected with a construct cointaning Wild-Type(WT) TNFRSF 1 A gene and c. 262 T>C (S 59 P), c. 362 G>A (R 92 Q) c. 236 C>T(T 50 M) TNFRSF 1 A mutants. The new four cell lines obtained were stimulated with TNFa(60 ng/mL) to evaluate the cellular location of the TNFR 1. The cell were stimulated with TNFa (60 ng/mL) at different intervals to evaluate the IkBa phosphorilation. The downstream targets of NF-kB signalling (IL 8) were measured in the supernatants (ELISAs) of all cell lines after they have been kept in culture medium alone (negative control) or stimulated for 4 hours with different concentration of TNFa(60 - 6 - 0. 6 ng/mL). Finally we choose the TNFa concentration of 6 ng/mL to evaluate the NFkB signalling by western blot in the cells. Since the S 59 P patient is actually in therapy with anti-IL 1 R, we used IL 1 b (1 ng/mL) as a stimulus to evaluate the NFkB signalling. To compare the in vitro results, the same conditions were performed in PBMC from patients affected TRAPS with S 59 P and R 92 Q mutation and from healthy subjects. Results. At confocal mycroscopy. TNFa caused a membranal shift of TNFR 1 in WT, while it induced its cytoplasmatic accumulation in mutants. pIkB-a was reduced by TNFa and IL 1 b in WT, while in mutant we observed a significantly increase of phosphorilation of this protein. This was confirmed by activation and translocation of p 65 unit, witch was not observed in WT cells but marked induced in mutant cells, mainly by TNFa but also by IL 1 b TNFa dose-dependently induced IL 8 release, being the magnitude of increase significanlty higher in mutant cells with respect to WT cells. Patients data confirmed in vitro results. The phosphorilation of IkBa was constitutively increased in mutant PBMC respect to W/W. TNFa and IL 1 b intensify the phosphorilation. In mutant PBMC NFkB activation was maintained after TNFa stimulus. IL 1 b sustained the activation only in S 59 P PBMC. LPS induced a significant release of IL 1 b, IL 6, IL 8 and TNFa in all PBMC. In S 59 P PBMC mainly IL 1 b induce a significant and persistent enhancement of IL 6 and IL 8. Conclusions. The novel S 59 P mutation, in TNFRSF 1 A gene cause a TNFRI receptor defective in cellular trafficking and insensitive to ligand. The mutant receptor activated appears to induce a significant a persistent NFkB activation and cytokine release. In S 59 P TRAPS patient the NFkB pathway was basely activated despite treatment with anti-IL 1. This TNFR mutation appear to sensitize cells to IL 1 b effect...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe domesticated apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) {{has been}} {{distributed}} into diverse climatic conditions worldwide for commercial production of fruit. Apple trees need exposure to cold temperatures, {{referred to as}} chill unit (CU) accumulation during winter, in order for budbreak to occur promptly and uniformly after winter. In warmer production areas the application of dormancy breaking chemicals has enabled successful production of high chilling requiring apple cultivars in suboptimal environmental conditions. In the Western Cape region of South Africa it is common orchard practice to apply dormancy breaking chemicals after winter in order to stimulate vegetative growth. If this is not done prolonged dormancy symptoms (PDS) are experienced which include extended rest, less synchronised breaking of buds and reduced branching. An increasing awareness of both global warming and the negative effects {{associated with the use}} of chemical sprays (for both pest and disease resistance and growth regulation) has resulted in the need to breed cultivars better adapted to current and future environmental conditions. The breeding of new cultivars using conventional breeding methods is a time consuming process, especially in perennial tree species with a long juvenile phase such as apple. The implementation of marker-assistedbreeding (MAB) and selection (MAS) will enable the selection of favourable genotypes at a very early seedling stage. Although markers linked to genes involved in disease resistance for a variety of known apple pathogens have been identified and are already in use in breeding programs, the genetic determinants of dormancy related characteristics residing within the bud itself (endodormancy) are poorly understood. This hampers the genetic improvement of such characters. Although this study focused on time of initial vegetative budbreak IVB, there are various other characteristics that can be associated with dormancy, such as position and number of budbreak and budbreak duration. The unravelling of the genetic basis of complex traits such as dormancy, can be done through the construction of a genetic linkage map followed by the identification of genomic regions, known as quantitative trait loci (QTL), that can be <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> the trait of interest. This study involved the construction of genetic linkage maps for two mapping pedigrees where the low chilling requiring cultivar ‘Anna’ was used as common male parent in crosses with the higher chilling requiring ‘Golden Delicious’ and ‘Sharpe’s Early’. A third mapping pedigree, with ‘Golden Delicious’ as female parent and ‘Prima’ as male parent, was also included. Maps consisted of transferable SSR markers only, facilitating the alignment with the proposed apple reference map (Silfverberg-Dilworth et al., 2006) and adherence to the common LG numbering system now being used for apple genetic linkage maps (Maliepaard et al., 1998). A number of newly developed EST-SSR markers are reported, some of which are candidates for filling large gaps between adjacent SSR markers on the apple reference map. An interactive database was developed to successfully manage the large amount of data generated during this investigation. A selective mapping, or bin mapping strategy (Vision et al., 2000) was developed for two of the three mapping populations in order to facilitate the incorporation and positioning of newly developed markers onto existing genetic linkage maps. This involves the screening of new markers on a small subset of the population, drastically reducing the cost and time involved. Genetic linkage maps constructed allowed for the detection of 18 putative QTLs affecting the time of IVB. Four of these QTLs co-localize with previously identified QTLs. A QTL identified on LG 8 confirms a previously identified QTL (Segura et al., 2007), while one of the QTLs identified on LG 9 might coincide with a QTL identified on the corresponding LG 3 of the genetic linkage map constructed by Conner et al. (1998). Two QTLs identified on LG 10 might coincide with markers found to co-segregate with time of budbreak in an earlier study conducted by Lawson et al. (1995). An additional 14 QTLs involved in time of IVB have been identified. We proposed the testing of four markers in a validation study conducted on a second mapping pedigree derived from a cross between ‘Anna’ and ‘Golden Delicious’. These markers are CH 04 a 12, CH 04 c 06 y, CH 01 h 01 and A 267. Not only do these markers show significant levels of association with the time of IVB, but segregation of parental alleles from the cultivar ‘Anna’ for two of these markers, CH 04 c 06 y and CH 01 h 01, were found to be associated with the time of IVB in different genetic backgrounds. The identification of markers closely associated with time of IVB will facilitate the implementation of MAS in breeding programs in order to breed cultivars that are better adapted to local climatic conditions...|$|E
40|$|In {{line with}} Guytons work, {{the goal of}} our {{research}} was to explore in t hree European populations whether the properties of large arteries are a <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> renal sodium handling, which itself changes with environm ental factors and with variation in {{a large number of}} genes. Before enga ging in the genetic analyses proper, we first studied the familial aggre gation and the heritability of arterial properties. In all our analyses, we accounted for relatedness among participants and for covariables and confounders. In a first study, we compared the arterial characteristics and blood pre ssure (BP) in normotensive offspring of two normotensive parents (OFF/NT) and normotensive offspring, who had at least one hypertensive parent (OFF/HT). We measured peripheral pulse pressure (PPp) by conventional and 24 -h ambulatory BP. A SphygmoCor device was used to determine the centr al (CAIx) and peripheral (PAIx) systolic augmentation indexes, central p ulse pressure (PPc), and aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV). Compared wit h OFF/NT (n= 59; 16 to 34 years of age), the OFF/HT (n= 174; 17 to 40 year s) had higher (0. 14 <P< 0. 0007) in OFF m 6. 6 vs. (7. 4 aPWV (108. 8 % CAIx 44. 9 %), (54. 7 % PAIx Hg), mm 26 (28 PPc (0. 05 <P< 0. 0008) Hg). 47 48 and Hg 6 7 114 70 (118 24 -h Hg) 42 46 71 75 (121 PPp BP aPWV. In a family-based po pulation sample consisting of 204 parents (mean age, 51. 7 years) and 290 offspring (29. 4 years), we investigated the heritability and familial a ggregation of PPp, CAIx, PAIx and aPWV. We partitioned the phenotypic co rrelation between these traits into shared genetic and environmental com ponents. We found significant heritability for PPp, CAIx, PAIx, and mean arterial pressure ranging from 0. 37 to 0. 41; P&# 8804; 0. 0001. The parent -offspring correlation coefficients were significant for all arterial in dexes (r&# 8805; 0. 12; P&# 8804; 0. 02) with the exception of PPc (P= 0. 90). T he sib-sib correlations were also significant for CAIx (r= 0. 22; P= 0. 001). The genetic correlation between aPWV and the other arterial indexes we re significant (&# 961;G&# 8805; 0. 29, P< 0. 0001). The corresponding environ mental correlations were only significantly positive for PPp (&# 961;E= 0. 10. P= 0. 03). In the Flemish population sample, we also ultrasonographically measured diameter, cross-sectional compliance (CC) and distensibility (DC) of the carotid, brachial, and femoral arteries. In multivariable-adjusted anal yses of 1069 untreated subjects (mean age, 41. 6 years), CC and DC of the femoral artery increased with higher fractional distal sodium reabsorpt ion (RNadist), as assessed by the clearance of endogenous lithium. Diffe rences associated with a 1 &# 8209;SD change in RNadist were 51. 7 mm 2 /kPa ´ 10 - 3 (P= 0. 0002) and 0. 56 ´ 10 - 3 /kPa (P= 0. 004) for femoral CC and DC, respectively. In women as well as in men, a 1 -SD increment in fractional proximal sodium reabsorption (RNaprox) was associated with d ecreases in femoral and brachial diameter, amounting to 111. 6 mm (P= 0. 00 3) and 52. 5 mm (P= 0. 016), respectively. There was no consistent associat ion between the properties of the elastic carotid artery and renal sodiu m handling. In 1126 subjects from the same Flemish population (mean age, 43. 8 years), we investigated whether arterial characteristics are related to the ge nes encoding ADD 1 (Gly 460 Trp), ADD 2 (C 1797 T) and ADD 3 (A 386 G). In s ingle gene analyses, brachial diameter was 0. 15 mm (P= 0. 0022) larger, an d brachial CC and DC were 0. 017 mm 2 /kPa (P= 0. 0029) and 1. 55 10 - 3 /kPa (P= 0. 013) lower in ADD 3 AA than ADD 3 GG homozygotes with an additive effect of the G allele. In multiple-gene analyses, the association of brachial diameter and DC with the ADD 3 G allele only occurred in ADD 1 GlyGly hom ozygotes. Otherwise, the associations between the arterial phenotypes in the three vascular beds and the ADD 1 or ADD 2 polymorphisms were not sig nificant. There was no evidence for population stratification (0. 07 &# 880 4;P&# 8804; 0. 96). Transmission of the mutated ADD 3 G allele was associate d with smaller brachial diameter in 342 informative offspring ( 0. 12 ± 0. 0 4 mm; P= 0. 0085) and in 209 offspring, who were ADD 1 GlyGly homozygo tes ( 0. 14 ± 0. 06 mm; P= 0. 018). Finally, in 1064 Flemish subjects (mean age, 43. 6 years), we assessed th e multiple-gene effects of ADD 1 (Gly 460 Trp), AGT (C 532 T and G 6 A) and A T 1 R (A 1166 C). In ADD 1 Trp allele carriers, but not in ADD 1 GlyGly h omozygotes (P-value for interaction &# 8804; 0. 014), femoral CC was s ignificantly higher (0. 74 vs. 0. 65 mm 2 /kPa; P= 0. 020) in carriers of the AT 1 R C allele than in AT 1 R AA homozygotes, with a similar trend for femo ral DC (11. 3 vs. 10. 2 10 - 3 /kPa; P= 0. 055). Family-based analyses confirme d these results. Brachial diameter (4. 35 vs. 4. 18 mm) and plasma renin a ctivity (PRA, 0. 23 vs. 0. 14 ng/ml/h) were increased (P&# 8804; 0. 005) in A GT CG haplotype homozygotes compared with non-carriers, whereas the oppo site was true for brachial DC (12. 4 vs. 14. 4 10 - 3 /kPa; P= 0. 011). There w as no interaction between AGT and any other gene in relation to the meas ured phenotypes. In conclusion, in this doctoral dissertation, we demonstrated significan t familial aggregation and significant heritability of arterial properti es. We also noticed that higher RNadist was associated with higher femoral CC and DC, and that higher RNaprox was associated with decr eased diameters of muscular arteries. The aforementioned observations ju stified our analyses of genes, which are involved in renal sodium handli ng. In ADD 1 GlyGly homozygotes, the properties of the brachial artery we re related to the ADD 3 (A 386 G) polymorphism. Furthermore, ADD 1 and AT 1 R interactively determined the elastic properties of the femoral artery. T here was a single-gene effect of the AGT promoter haplotypes on brachial properties and PRA. Overall, our findings suggest, {{that there might be a}} genetically determined influence of renal sodium handling on arterial properties, or vice versa, or that common genetic pathways might influen ce both arterial and renal function.

40|$|There {{has been}} a steady {{increase}} in litter size, and consequently farrowing duration, in modern pig production during recent decades. At the same time, annual removal rates due to reproductive failure have increased and an association with litter size demonstrated. Underlying physiological mechanisms for the associations between these phenomena are not well established. It is plausible {{that the increase in}} farrowing duration is causally linked with the increase in litter size because it takes longer to farrow a larger litter. Therefore, it is possible that prolonged farrowing negatively affects subsequent reproductive performance of sows. Postpartum dysgalactia syndrome (PDS), the major puerperal disease complex of sows, can cause subfertility, {{but it is not clear}} that this is linked with prolonged farrowing. However, PDS and prolonged farrowing represent similar risk factors regarding increased backfat, constipation, low dietary fiber, and restricted movement in farrowing crates. In some studies there was evidence of a connection between prolonged farrowing and increased incidence of general clinical symptoms such as fever and anorexia. Therefore, it is feasible that prolonged farrowing increases the risk for PDS, which in turn increases the risk of subsequent subfertility. In order to understand better these tentative relationships it makes sense to look at the different symptoms dividually, it being most likely that prolonged parturition in particular affects the incidence of metritis. Puerperal metritis is an acute inflammation and infection of the uterus that occurs during the first week after parturition and is characterized by an enlarged uterus that results from fluid accumulation. In other species, including the cow, a long and difficult parturition increases the risk of puerperal metritis, which in turn delays uterine involution and subsequently reduces fertility by disturbing postpartum ovarian follicular growth and ovulation. Furthermore, long and difficult parturitions can cause retained placenta, which is of major consequence in the etiology of postpartum metritis. We hypothesized that prolonged farrowing decreases subsequent fertility, that is, pregnancy rate. Furthermore, we hypothesized that prolonged farrowing causes retention of placentae and metritis, delays uterine involution and perturbs follicular growth after weaning. We also hypothesized that sows that undergo prolonged farrowing release less oxytocin at subsequent estrus in response to boar stimulation. It is also known that prolonged parturition is linked with reduced oxytocin concentrations. We therefore speculated that this is the case also at subsequent breeding. At that time, oxytocin is needed for sperm transport to the site of fertilization and formation of the sperm reservoirs and thus, impairment of transport may have a negative effect on the establishment of pregnancy. Furthermore, corpus luteum function is important for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. The primary function of the corpus luteum is secretion of progesterone, the pregnancy hormone, and this function depends on other hormones active before embryonic attachment and maternal recognition. Whether corpus luteum function is compromised in sows with prolonged farrowing was not investigated in this study, but validation and testing of a transvaginal ultrasound-guided biopsy method for luteal tissue was done. This represents an easy and reliable tool for future investigations of corpus luteum function. In the first part of the study we determined the farrowing duration (time between expulsion of first and last piglet) of sows and explored whether there is a negative effect on subsequent post-weaning pregnancy rate (n = 148). In the following part, we explored the relationship between farrowing duration and placenta expulsion (n = 142), and postpartum uterine size and intrauterine fluid (n = 99). For that, placenta expulsion was observed until 24 h after birth of the last piglet and ultrasonography was used during the first week postpartum to examine the uteri of the sows. Uterine size and intrauterine fluid were used as indicators for initial uterine involution and puerperal metritis. Furthermore, we determined the farrowing duration of sows (n = 30) and monitored the subsequent follicular development using transrectal ultrasound twice a day between the third day after weaning and ovulation. At estrus, blood samples were collected in the presence of a boar in order to determine the endogenous oxytocin concentrations and release patterns. The results show that sows with a prolonged parturition (> 300 min) were 3. 4 (odds; P = 0. 027) more likely not to be pregnant. Farrowing duration was highly <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> retained placentae. Sows that experienced total (no expulsion of placental parts; 3 %) and partially retained placentae (no expulsion of placental parts after birth of the last piglet; 3 %) had longer farrowing durations (1009 ± 275 and 734 ± 136 min) than sows without retained placentae (369 ± 202 min; P = 0. 021 and P = 0. 004). Otherwise, farrowing duration conformed to a quadratic relationship with the number of expelled placental parts (P = 0. 001), placental expulsion duration (time between expulsion of first and last placental part; P = 0. 002) and time between expulsion of last piglet and last placental part (P = 0. 024). On the other hand, use of oxytocin increased number of expelled placental parts (LSmeans ± SD, 3. 8 ± 0. 2 vs. 2. 9 ± 0. 3, P = 0. 035), decreased the placental expulsion duration (172 ± 44 vs. 328 ± 26 min, P = 0. 011) and time between expulsion of last piglet and last placental part (148 ± 48 vs. 300 ± 24 min, P = 0. 025). Furthermore, prolonged farrowing (β ± SE, Wald χ 2, Odds; 2. 0 ± 0. 5, 13. 1, 7. 6; P = 0. 001), obstetrical intervention (1. 5 ± 0. 7, 4. 4, 4. 3; P = 0. 036) and two or more stillborn piglets (1. 4 ± 0. 7, 3. 8, 3. 9; P = 0. 052) increased the risk of having enlarged uterine size whereas oxytocin administration (- 1. 5 ± 0. 7, 4. 7, 0. 2, P = 0. 040) decreased the risk. Two or more stillborn piglets (2. 6 ± 0. 9, 8. 7, 13. 7; P = 0. 003), obstetrical intervention (1. 8 ± 0. 8, 5. 0, 6. 0; P = 0. 025), prolonged farrowing (1. 7 ± 0. 8, 4. 3, 5. 7; P = 0. 039) and impaired placenta expulsion (3. 3 ± 1. 7, 4. 0, 26. 9; P = 0. 044) were associated with intrauterine fluid. After weaning, OT concentrations were higher in sows with prolonged farrowing than in sows with shortened farrowing (LSmeans ± SD, 28. 0 ± 7. 7 vs. 20. 6 ± 7. 7, P < 0. 01). OT concentrations correlated with diameters of the follicles measured 5 d after weaning and when the follicles reached their maximum size after weaning (r = 0. 61, P < 0. 01 and r = 0. 57, P < 0. 01, respectively). The results show that sows with prolonged farrowing can show subsequent ubfertility, which may be linked with compromised uterine health. Sows with prolonged farrowing are at higher risk of impaired placental expulsion, puerperal metritis and impaired uterine involution. Using exogenous oxytocin after parturition may be useful in sows with prolonged farrowing in order to lower the risk for retained placentae and subsequent metritis. Obstetrical intervention should be careful and done under antiseptic conditions. Proper parturition management should be used in order to prevent piglets being stillborn. Against expectations, sows with prolonged farrowing duration had higher oxytocin concentrations and larger follicles at subsequent estrus. This merits further investigation. In addition, we adopted and tested a transvaginal ultrasound-guided biopsy method for luteal tissue, which can be used to study corpus luteum function. No effects were observed on the cyclicity and morphology of the reproductive organs of the sows: not on corpus luteum function, pregnancy rate, gestation length or subsequent litter size. A biopsy was obtained for 50 % of all attempts. Sows from which at least one biopsy was obtained were older (parity 5. 0 ± 2. 8 vs. 2. 2 ± 0. 4; mean ± SD), heavier (290 ± 26 vs. 244 ± 27 kg) and had more backfat (11. 4 ± 2. 7 vs. 6. 4 ± 2. 5 mm; P < 0. 05 for all) compared with sows from which no samples could be obtained...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, the food {{industry}} has put in much effort to pos itively contribute to animal and human health using functional foods suc h as prebiotics. Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients that ben eficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or a ctivity {{of one or more}} types of favourable bacteria such as bifidobacter ia and lactobacilli. Fermentation of prebiotics stimulates the saccharolytic activity of the colonic microbiota resulting in the production of short chain fatty acid s (acetic acid, butyric acid and propionic acid). To the contrary, prote olytic activity is reduced with less production of potentially toxic met abolites (phenols, sulfides and amines). Until now, fructo-oligosacchari des and inulin are well-established prebiotics, whereas other non-digest ible carbohydrates such as xylo-, galacto- isomalto- and soybean-oligosa ccharides have been considered as candidate prebiotics. Recently, arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS) have been proposed as a n ew prebiotic substrate by the Laboratory of Food Chemistry and Biochemis try (Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, K. U. Leuven). AXOS consist of a x ylopyranosyl backbone which is substituted with arabinofuranosyl residue s. They are produced by enzymatic degradation of arabinoxylans (AX), a c ereal dietary fibre. Through their high viscosity and water-binding capa city, AX {{have a positive impact on}} the functionality of cereals in biote chnological food processes such as bread-making and pasta-making. AX do not exert prebiotic properties since they are only partly fermented in t he colon. Depending on the substrate specificity of the endo- and exo-en zymes, AXOS with variable average degree of polymerisation (avDP) and av erage degree of arabinose substitution (avDAS) are obtained. Based upon experimental animal studies, performed at the Laboratory of F ood Chemistry and Biochemistry, low doses of AXOS have been demonstrated to have prebiotic activity. In humans, however, the effect of AXOS on t he colonic metabolism and fermentation pattern was largely unknown. The present research project aimed to characterise the influence of AXOS on the human gastrointestinal tract. Parameters of proximal motility an d digestion have been measured to evaluate the effects of AXOS on the pr oximal part of the gastrointestinal tract. To examine the prebiotic acti vity of AXOS, we studied the influence of AXOS on the composition of the microbiota as well as the metabolic activity of the microbiota. The bio marker lactose-[15 N, 15 N]-ureide has been used to study the colonic ammo nia metabolism. The intake of prebiotics results in a larger fraction of [15 N]-NH 3 being taken up by the bacteria and excreted in faeces and a s maller fraction of the label being excreted in urine. Urinary p-cresol a nd phenol excretion were measured as an indication of protein fermentati on. Furthermore, bacterial enzyme activities and faecal volatile organic compounds were analysed as parameters of the colonic bacterial metaboli sm. To study the effects of AXOS on these different gastrointestinal par ameters, several dietary intervention studies were performed in healthy subjects. In Chapter III. 1, a preliminary study was performed in which AXOS was ad ministered for the first time to healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the minimal dose of AXOS with an avDP of 15 and an avDA S of 0. 27 (AXOS- 15 - 0. 27) that causes a detectable effect on the colonic metabolism. Therefore, single doses of AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 ranging between 0. 0 g and 5. 0 g were administered. The increased hydrogen excretion upon a dos e of 2. 2 g demonstrated that AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 is fermented by the bacteria in the colon. Gastric emptying rate, oro-caecal transit and total transit were not influenced by the administration of AXOS- 15 - 0. 27. Upon a dose o f 2. 2 g AXOS- 15 - 0. 27, a decrease in urinary 15 N-excretion was observed al ong with an increase of 15 N in faeces. These results indicated a stimula tion of bacterial activity and, consequently, a higher uptake of 15 N by the bacteria. These findings suggested that a minimal dose of 2. 2 g AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 favourably modulates the colonic bacterial metabolism. Subsequently, we evaluated the influence of 2. 2 g AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 on proxima l motility and nutrient digestion (Chapter III. 2). This study was necess ary to exclude that changes in transit and digestion through supplementa tion of prebiotics affect the supply of substrates to the colon and thus influence the fermentation process. We established that a low dose of A XOS- 15 - 0. 27 did not influence the supply of proteins and lipids to the c olon. Therefore, we assumed that the observed influences of AXOS on colo nic metabolism were not due to differences in proximal motility and dige stion, yet, could be attributed to events occurring in the colon. In Chapter III. 3, two placebo-controlled, randomised, cross-over studies were performed to investigate the gastrointestinal effects of AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 and placebo. In the first study, the substrates were administered fo r two weeks in a dose of 2. 2 g/d, whereas the dose was increased to 5. 0 g/ d in the second study. In both studies, the colonic ammonia metabolism, protein fermentation and bacterial enzyme activity remained unchanged. H owever, the levels of bifidobacteria were increased after administration of 5. 0 g/d AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 for 2 weeks, indicating the prebiotic potential of AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 in healthy humans. Chapter III. 4 describes the results of a randomised, cross-over study in which the influence of AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 on several gastrointestinal paramete rs was compared to those of the reference prebiotic fructo-oligosacchari de enriched inulin (FOS-IN). In the presence of 5. 0 g/d AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 or FO S-IN, a clear effect on colonic ammonia metabolism was observed. The lev els of bifidobacteria were slightly increased after a 2 -weeks intake per iod of AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 or FOS-IN. Because of the positive effects on colonic metabolism and microbiota observed in this study, we performed a second study with a reduced dose (2. 2 g/d) of AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 and FOS-IN. This dose did not influence the colonic ammonia metabolism. However, the levels o f bifidobacteria were significantly increased. In both studies, protein fermentation and bacterial enzyme activities were not changed. Obviously, the effects of AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 and FOS-IN were very similar at the same do ses. We also concluded that changes in microbiota were not necessarily a <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> changes in the colonic metabolism. In a next study, a higher dose of AXOS (10. 0 g/d) was administered to the subjects. Again, we evaluated their influence on different gastrointest inal parameters as well as the tolerance of AXOS (Chapter III. 5). Theref ore, we performed a placebo-controlled, randomised, cross-over study in which 10. 0 g/d AXOS- 6 - 0. 26 was administered to healthy subjects for 3 wee ks. The intake of AXOS- 6 - 0. 26 did not cause biologically relevant change s in haematological and clinical chemistry parameters. Furthermore, the total symptom score was only slightly increased. Urinary p-cresol excret ion was significantly decreased, whereas bifidobacteria levels were sign ificantly increased after intake of AXOS- 6 - 0. 26. These results show that AXOS is well-tolerated in healthy subjects. In addition, protein fermen tation was influenced at these relatively high doses. To accurately characterise the bacterial colonic metabolism, metabolite profiling of volatile organic components from faeces was applied (Chapte r III. 6). Faecal samples collected during the intervention studies descr ibed in Chapter III. 4 and III. 5 were analysed. Multivariate data analysi s allowed discrimination of the faecal samples collected after intake of 5. 0 g/d AXOS- 9 - 0. 26, 10. 0 g/d AXOS- 6 - 0. 26 or 5. 0 g/d FOS-IN from the sampl es collected at baseline on the basis of a different metabolite pattern. The results indicate that this technique of metabolite profiling is a p romising tool to study the influence of dietary interventions. During the execution of the project, a considerable variability was obse rved in the biomarkers used to evaluate the colonic metabolism (urinary p-cresol and phenol excretion, and 15 N-excretion). Therefore, the repeat ability of these biomarkers was evaluated in the last chapter (Chapter I II. 7). From the results, we concluded that the repeatability of the para meters was acceptable and that the observed variability was not due to i ncomplete urine collections nor to variability in dietary intake. In general, we concluded that AXOS is also in humans a carbohydrate with prebiotic activity. Additional research is necessary to further unravel the structure activity pattern of different types of AXOS preparations and to elucidate the relation between microbiota and their metabolic act ivity. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Glycodelin is a 162 {{amino acid}} {{secreted}} glycoprotein {{classified as a}} member of the lipocalin (carriers of small hydrophobic molecules) superfamily based on the presence of lipocalin signature motifs in its primary sequence. The protein has several isoforms which are expressed by various primate tissues, predominantly reproductive tissues. These isoforms are products of the same gene and hence have the same primary sequence; however, they are differentially glycosylated depending on tissue origin. The individual glycodelin isoforms perform very varied functions, which are largely dictated or modulated by the specific glycans on the molecule. Glycodelin A (GdA) is the major glycodelin isoform of the female reproductive tract; and is subclassified as an immunocalin (lipocalins with immunological function) due to its ability to modulate immune responses. Diverse activities have been associated with GdA; pertaining to determination of cell fate, tissue differentiation and significantly, immunomodulation towards fetal-allograft tolerance. The fetus expresses paternal allo-antigens and would be regarded as non-self or foreign by the maternal immune system. However, several synergistic mechanisms of immunomodulation at the fetal-maternal interface establish tolerance towards fetal antigens, protecting it from rejection. GdA is secreted by the uterine endometrium under progesterone induction, and is therefore the most abundant progesterone-regulated secretory glycoprotein of the uterus at the time of implantation and early pregnancy. GdA has been shown to have immunomodulatory activity targeting innate, humoral and cellular responses. It is inhibitory to T cell and B cell proliferation, and NK cell activity. It stimulates the Th 2 -type cytokine profile, and inhibits interleukins IL- 2 and IL- 1 production from mitogenically stimulated lymphocytes and mononuclear cell cultures. It has been reported from our laboratory that GdA induces apoptosis in activated T cells. GdA has also been shown to be inhibitory to B cells and monocytes. Clinical studies correlate subnormal levels of GdA with implantation Synopsis failure, habitual abortion and recurrent miscarriage. Due to its pleiotropic nature namely its diverse activities on different immune cell types; its spatio-temporal restriction of expression by progesterone; and its indispensable requirement for successful pregnancy; GdA is being increasingly recognized as a mechanism towards fetal allograft tolerance. Our laboratory has focused on the T cell inhibitory activity of GdA, with particular emphasis on T cell apoptosis. This study was aimed at delineating the molecular mechanism of GdA-induced apoptosis in activated T cells. Previous results from our laboratory have revealed that GdA-induced apoptosis is caspase dependent; and is not initiated by the extrinsic pathway involving Fas/death receptor signailing or initiator caspase 8. In this thesis, we present evidence that GdA triggers the intrinsic apoptotic program in T cells. Characterization of the apoptotic program initiated by GdA is presented in Chapter 1. We observe that GdA treatment triggers a stress response leading to decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, which indicates mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP). GdA-induced apoptosis can also be blocked by inhibition of caspase 9, the initiator caspase for the intrinsic program. The kinetics of mitochondrial depolarization precede onset of DNA fragmentation in both peripheral blood T cells and Jurkat cells treated with GdA. We also observe caspase 2 activation downstream of the mitochondria. Overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl- 2 is sufficient to protect from GdA-induced cellular stress indicating that the apoptotic program can be reversed upstream of the mitochondria. Further, our studies reveal that stress signaling by GdA is not mediated by any of the canonical second messengers of stress signaling, namely, reactive oxygen species; the stress activated protein kinases JNK, p 38 MAPK and ERK; intracellular calcium or ceramide. It has been reported that GdA desensitizes T cell receptor (TCR) signaling by decreasing the stability of TCR-triggered phosphoproteins, probably by its association ith the transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase CD 45. TCR-desensitization would result in decreased proliferation and cytokine secretion, and has been postulated as the mechanism of T cell-inhibition by GdA. We have tested this theory and Chapter 2 provides evidence that the apoptogenic activity of GdA is not a consequence of its ability to blunt TCR-signaling. Further, GdA-induced apoptosis does not depend on components of the TCR signal cascade namely CD 45, the kinase Lck and CTLA 4, molecules that are proven transducers of apoptotic signals to the mitochondria in response to diverse stress stimuli. GdA triggers apoptosis in the CD 45 deficient cell line J 45. 01 with similar kinetics of MMP and DNA fragmentation as with Synopsis wildtype cells, demonstrating that CD 45 is not the determinant receptor for apoptosis on cells. We also observe that GdA is inhibitory to T cells stimulated with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore, which bypasses TCR-proximal signaling events; and that GdA treatment does not interfere with early T cell activation as evidenced from induction of the activation marker CD 69. Thus, GdA initiates mitochondrial stress mediated apoptosis in T cells by a pathway that is distinct and independent from the TCR-coupled signaling pathway. This study presents a novel mode of immunosuppression for GdA and highlights the ability of GdA to suppress the immune response by more than one mechanism. Cell surface glycoproteins undergo alterations in their carbohydrate profiles upon T cell activation and differentiation, and this has a significant role to play in lymphocyte fate and function. One such global alteration in cell surface glycans is a difference in sialylation upon T cell activation and differentiation. While activated T cell have a lesser degree of sialylated surface glycoproteins as compared to naïve T cells, memory T cells are sialylated to a higher extent, and Th 2 cells have more cell surface sialic acids than Th 1 cells. As GdA is capable of triggering apoptosis in activated T cells, we investigated the requirement of cell surface glycans for differential recognition of T cell subsets by GdA, the results for which are detailed in Chapter 3. We observe that the activity of GdA could be competed out by asialofetuin and not fetuin, suggesting that GdA recognizes terminal galactose residues on asialofetuin glycans, which would be masked by sialic acids in case of fetuin glycans. This assumption was confirmed as the free sugars lactose and galactose, but not annose, could also competitively inhibit GdA activity. We also demonstrate that the lectin-activity of dA is calcium independent, typical of mammalian galectins. Thus, our results reveal GdA to be a novel galactose-specific lectin of the female reproductive tract. This carbohydrate specificity of GdA is responsible for its apoptotic activity on T cells. The selectivity of GdA towards activated T cells is a result of increased exposure of terminal galactose residues on activated T cell surface receptors, as demonstrated by staining of naïve and stimulated T cells with Fluorescent lectin-conjugates of different carbohydrate specificities. We also demonstrate hat GdA shows specificity towards N-liked glycans on cell surface glycoproteins. This is evident from the use of glycan processing inhibitors, which prevent addition of galactose to the core glycan on the nascent polypeptide chain. We observe that inhibition of processing of N-glycans, and not O-glycans, render cells resistant to GdA. Incidentally, we observe that another property of GdA, namely its ability to induce Synopsis epithelial differentiation and apoptosis in the breast cancer cell line MCF- 7, is also due to ts galactose-specific lectin activity. It is therefore probable that the diverse functions <b>ssociated</b> <b>with</b> GdA are a consequence of its ability to recognize different glycoprotein receptors on different cell types. We can thus draw a comparison for GdA with the galectins, which are the prototype beta-galactoside binding mammalian lectins with diverse roles in determining cell fate and apoptosis, especially in the immune system. In fact, the immune-related activities of GdA are almost identical to the effects of galectin- 1 on the immune system. Galectin- 1 has also very recently been shown to play a significant role in fetal-tolerance. This raises a strong possibility of shared receptors for GdA and galectin- 1 on the T cell surface, resulting from a shared calcium-independent recognition property for complex glycans with terminal galactose residues. Two predominant galectin- 1 receptors on T cells are the glycoproteins CD 45 and CD 7. We have already observed that though GdA may recognize CD 45, this association does not mediate its apoptotic activity. We therefore examined the possibility of the activation-induced glycoprotein CD 7 as receptor for GdA. Our experiments reveal that the apoptotic activity of GdA on different T cell lines is dependent on the degree of CD 7 expression by these cell lines. Notably, the CD 7 negative lymphoma cell line HuT 78 was completely resistant to GdA. To confirm CD 7 as receptor, we obtained a cell line HuT 78. 7 in which CD 7 expression has been restored by stable transfection. We observed that these CD 7 positive cells now responded to GdA comparable to Jurkat cells, and GdA-induced apoptosis in these cells could be completely competed out with asialofetuin, not fetuin. To summarize, our study identifies GdA as a novel pregnancy-related galectin-like lectin of the female reproductive tract, which triggers mitochondrial stress and apoptosis in activated T cells. GdA shares receptors on T cells with galectin- 1 due a common carbohydrate recognition property. We identify CD 7 as a molecular target for GdA on activated T cells, capable of mediating the apoptotic signal. However, it is likely that GdA also recognizes other galectin receptors on T cells, as it is capable of inhibition by more than one mechanism. This underscores the requirement for redundant mechanisms indispensable for establishment and maintenance of successful pregnancy...|$|E
