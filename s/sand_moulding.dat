In 1706, further partners were admitted, the business becoming an early unincorporated joint stock company with a capital of £8000. While there, Darby recruited skilled 'Dutchmen' to operate a brass battery with trip hammers. He may also have recruited men skilled in <b>sand</b> <b>moulding</b> {{as opposed to the}} loam moulding hitherto used in England.

30|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>mould</b> milling is a {{new process}} for <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> production, no {{in-depth}} study has yet been made for the cutting mechanism of <b>sand</b> <b>mould.</b> There is limited literature {{on the study of}} <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> cutting force. The quasi-solid–liquid transition feature of granular materials can be considered as an appropriate basis for further studying the deformation of shear area when cutting <b>sand</b> <b>mould.</b> In order to improve the integrity and accuracy of <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> structure and reduce the tool wear by controlling the size of cutting force, in this paper, the quasi-solid–liquid transition theory of granular system is introduced into the parallel-sided shear zone model of the cutting process to analyze the flow stress of shear zone. Through studying the shear strain rate of shear zone, the model of dynamic cutting forces in <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> milling is established. Then, the cutting force of milling with straight cutting edges is predicted and discussed.|$|R

30|$|According to the {{constitutive}} equation of <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> shear zone (Eq. (23)), for the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> with uniform grain size, {{there are two}} aspects {{of the influence of}} particle size on cutting force. One is the static strength of <b>sand</b> <b>mould,</b> the other are the linear and quadric terms of shear rate which are the momentum and kinetic energy of the moving sand respectively. In general, the static strength of <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> increases with the increase of the diameter of sand, and the momentum and kinetic energy of the single sand also increase with the diameter of sand particles. So the cutting force of the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> increases with the diameter increasing. However, the sand granularity in the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> is of 70 / 140, which means that the size of sand distributes randomly within a certain range. Therefore, the distributions of the sand particles and strength are non-uniform. In the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> cutting process, when cutting the large sand particle or the region with higher strength, the cutting forces will increase. Otherwise, cutting forces will decrease. In the {{constitutive equation}}s of prediction model (Eq. (23)), the compression strength σs is calculated as the macroscopical experimental results of the <b>sand</b> <b>mould,</b> and the <b>sand</b> particle diameter is calculated as an average diameter. That means the predictive model does not consider the effect of non-homogeneity, so the fluctuation of predicted cutting force is lower than the measured results.|$|R

30|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>mould</b> milling is {{the process}} of milling casting mould {{directly}} with CNC milling technology, in which the mould production does not use molds or patterns. Compared with the traditional casting process, a <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> produced by milling can avoid wooden pattern making, eliminate the work steps of the casting process and reduce energy consumption [1]. So, the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> milling process is a typical example of green manufacturing, and is considered as a revolution in the field of traditional casting in single and mini-batch casting production. An accurate prediction of the dynamic cutting forces of milling <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> is very important to study the ability of the process, surface quality, and monitoring the tool wear [2].|$|R
30|$|The {{physical}} property of <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> {{can be considered}} as the same of continuous medium on a macro-scale. During the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> milling process, the rake face of milling cutter moving at high velocity squeezes the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> and the binding bridges among the sands in the shear zone are forced to bend and shear, causing the bonded sands to shear along the shear plane. When all the binding bridges break, the chip becomes a flowing granular system. So, the process of cutting <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> is similar to the process of the granules transition from solid state to liquid state. In addition, the test results show that the temperature of cutter does not increase significantly during the process [2], so the effect of temperature on cutting force can be neglected.|$|R

Castings produced using <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> is known to have peculiar microstructures depending on average size, distribution and shape of the <b>moulding</b> <b>sand</b> grains and the chemical composition of the alloy.

Experiments have been conducted to generate the data for modelling. Various sand mixes have been prepared varying the amounts of clay, coal dust, moisture and mulling time. For each sand mix composition, the permeability was measured. The models were trained and tested with data set and were used for predicting the properties of moulding sand mixture.

The {{flexibility of the}} process allows complex components to be manufactured in high volumes in fully automated environments. Associated with such {{components are}} equally complex tools whose manufacture is both expensive and time consuming. It is therefore vital that the component design be evaluated thoroughly with regard to both performance and manufacturability before commitment is made to expensive production tooling. The use of a physical prototype often provides the best method of design evaluation. The major routes to prototype manufacture are; material removal, rapid prototyping and rapid tooling. Rapid tooling techniques provide the most representative route, {{with the ability to}} produce polymeric prototypes (often in final material) by an injection moulding process. Research has been undertaken into two rapid tooling processes; enhanced silicone moulding and <b>sand</b> <b>moulding.</b> Both processes involve casting material against a rapid prototype (master pattern) to form a mould which is then used in the manufacture of product prototypes by injection moulding.

Standard foundry equipment that included universal strength machine, permeability meter, hardness tester, shatter index machine and quick moisture teller in the foundry workshop and laboratory of Ajaokuta Steel Company Limited, Nigeria were used as the research equipment.

30|$|Cutting {{force is}} one of the {{research}} hotspots in direct <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> milling because the cutting force directly affects the machining quality and tool wear. Unlike metals, <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> is a heterogeneous discrete deposition material. There is still a lack of theoretical research on the cutting force. In order to realize the prediction and control of the cutting force in the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> milling process, an analytical model of cutting force is proposed based on the unequal division shear zone model of orthogonal cutting. The deformation velocity relations of the chip within the orthogonal cutting shear zone are analyzed first. According to the flow behavior of granular, the unequal division shear zone model of <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> is presented, in which the governing equations of shear strain rate, strain and velocity are established. The constitutive relationship of quasi-solid–liquid transition is introduced to build the 2 D constitutive equation and deduce the cutting stress in the mould shear zone. According to the cutting geometric relations of up milling with straight cutting edge and the transformation relationship between cutting stress and cutting force, the dynamic cutting forces are predicted for different milling conditions. Compared with the experimental results, the predicted results show good agreement, indicating that the predictive model of cutting force in milling <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> is validated. Therefore, the proposed model can provide the theoretical guidance for cutting force control in high efficiency milling <b>sand</b> <b>mould.</b>|$|R

40|$|Successful {{case studies}} of metal casting {{applications}} using sand moulds and cores produced by additive manufacturing (AM) processes have been widely reported in the literature. The layered- based manufacturing process has revolutionised traditional <b>sand</b> <b>moulding</b> methods. This is essentially due to the numerous advantages of AM, including the reduction of design lead time {{and the ability to}} manufacture objects with complex geometry in a rapid turnaround time. Locally-available AM processes that are capable of producing sand moulds and cores include laser sintering (LS) and three-dimensional printing (3 DP), with the latter AM process growing in dominance over the former. However, {{a better understanding of the}} properties of parts produced by AM processes is required in order for the processes to be fully adopted by the foundry industry. Crucial characteristics of 3 DP sand parts related to strength, dimensional accuracy, and hardness are not well- known in terms of their magnitude and in comparison with conventionally-moulded sand parts. In this investigation, the physical properties of test specimens produced under standard manufacturing conditions, using a Voxeljet VX 1000 machine, were assessed for bend and tensile strength, hardness, friability, and surface finish. The physical properties of the 3 DP test specimens were then compared with the properties of laboratory hand- rammed test specimens.

40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis describes a research carried out into the introduction of an environmental management system (EMS) into an aluminium alloy foundry. The foundry, classified as a small and medium sized enterprise (SME), produces aluminium alloy castings by sand and gravity die casting processes. Its principal activities are the production of wood patterns, <b>sand</b> <b>moulding,</b> melting, machining and fettling processes. The company faces environmental pressure from government, customers and the local community. Manufacturing activities and products consume non-renewable resources and produce wastes, discharges and emissions. One way to manage those pressures and impacts is to introduce an environmental management system. The research investigates the environmental performance and impacts on a UK SME namely Hadleigh Castings Ltd, of the existing and future environmental legislation and taxation applied to the aluminium foundry, and the steps taken to introduce the EMS. These steps include policy formulation, assessment of environmental impacts, planning the environmental programme, implementation of procedures, manual, training, projects and audit to the final step of EMS review. The analysis highlights the benefits and problems arising from the introduction of an EMS. The commitment of resources was strongly dependent on external economic pressures. The preparatory review revealed non-compliance issues, which required solutions before implementation of the EMS could proceed. Achieving management commitment to change proved problematic {{in the face of}} production priorities and traditional attitudes. However, a number of benefits were identified. These included an increase in employees' awareness of environmental issues, improved working practices, the initiation of cultural change through better management and assignment of responsibility and an improved relationship with regulators...|$|E
