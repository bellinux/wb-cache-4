40|$|A Scissor Jack is a {{mechanical}} device used {{to lift a}} heavy vehicle from the ground for changing the wheel and for maintenance purpose. The most important fact of a jack is that it gives the user {{a mechanical}} advantage by changing the rotational motion into linear motion and allowing user to lift a heavy car to the require height. In this work we have designed different components of <b>scissors</b> <b>jack</b> using CAE tools i. e. CATIA andCalculate stresses induced in its different part which are responsible for failure and To Reduce its cost so that everyone can afford this. We have taken reference of Mahindra Bolero <b>Scissors</b> <b>Jack.</b> The Dimensions of <b>scissors</b> <b>jack</b> was measured by Vernier caliper. By measuring all the dimensions of components of <b>scissors</b> <b>jack</b> we have designed it in CATIA after that we assemble all the components of Jack to shape a model of <b>scissors</b> <b>jack</b> and calculated different parameters Max. shear stress Max. principal Tensile Stress Total torque required to lift the vehicle etc which is used in all components of <b>scissors</b> <b>jack</b> to avoid failure. To {{reduce the cost of}} jack we have taken two different sections of three different materials i. e. Mild Steel AISI 1045 grade Steel GS- 52. 3 Cast Steel and comparing which will be suited for above mentioned purpose. By using these materials we have calculate and compare the Strength to weight ratio and find which material is best suited for high load carrying capacity with minimum failure or deformation...|$|E

50|$|During the Napoleonic {{campaign}} in Egypt, Vivant Denon drew the circular zodiac, the more widely known one, and the rectangular zodiacs. In 1802, after the Napoleonic expedition, Denon published engravings {{of the temple}} ceiling in his Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Egypte. These elicited a controversy as {{to the age of}} the zodiac representation, ranging from tens of thousands to a thousand years to a few hundred, and whether the zodiac was a planisphere or an astrological chart. Sébastien Louis Saulnier, an antique dealer, commissioned Claude Lelorrain to remove the circular zodiac with saws, <b>jacks,</b> <b>scissors</b> and gunpowder. The zodiac ceiling was moved in 1821 to Restoration Paris and, by 1822, was installed by Louis XVIII in the Royal Library (later called the National Library of France). In 1922, the zodiac moved from there to the Louvre.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{the visual}} novel {{gameplay}} {{of the previous}} games, Ultra Despair Girls is a third-person adventure game with horror elements, in which players control Komaru Naegi {{as she tries to}} survive in a city overrun by Monokuma robots. Komaru is armed with a megaphone-shaped Hacking Gun that can use various types of Truth Bullet, which are unlocked as the game progresses. Using the Hacking Gun, Komaru can perform various actions, such as attacking enemies, taking control of them, activating certain machinery, or scanning the environment for clues or hidden items. During the course of the game, Komaru is also assisted by the first game's Toko Fukawa, who uses a stun gun to switch over to her split personality, the serial killer Genocide Jack. When the stun gun is charged up, players can temporarily take control of Jack, who can attack with razor sharp scissors. Attacking enemies fills up the [...] "Scissor Fever" [...] gauge, allowing Jack to perform special attacks to instantly defeat multiple enemies. Monocoins earned from defeating enemies can be used to purchase upgrades for both Komaru's Hacking Gun and <b>Jack's</b> <b>scissors,</b> and various skills can be unlocked and equipped, such as extended health. The game features three difficulty settings, with harder difficulties containing less ammunition and fewer opportunities to use Jack's assistance.|$|R
