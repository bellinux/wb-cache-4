5|$|Mina <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be {{retiring}} from public appearances after an exclusive {{concert at the}} La Bussola Club on 16 September. Thousands of people turned up at the nightclub's doorstep. Gianni Ferrio's Orchestra featured Gianni Basso on tenor saxophone and Oscar Valdambrini on trumpet.|$|E
5|$|A {{major issue}} in her initial {{election}} was whether the two candidates would vote to override President George W. Bush's veto of {{an expansion of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program. Tsongas <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> vote to override, and it was reported Ogonowski would uphold the veto. Hours after being sworn into office on October 18, Tsongas voted to override, but the vote failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority.|$|E
5|$|Alfre Woodard {{was cast}} as Lily Sloane, Cochrane's assistant. When Frakes {{first moved to}} Los Angeles, Woodard {{was one of the}} first people he met. During a {{conversation}} at a barbecue, Woodard <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> become Frakes' godmother, as he did not have one. Through this relationship, Frakes was able to cast Woodard in the film; he considered it a coup to land an Academy Award-nominated actress. Woodard considered Lily to be the character most like herself out of all the roles she has played.|$|E
50|$|She {{retired from}} Fremont in May 2008. Prior to this, Yang also volunteered as a kayaking guide with the Newport Bay Interpretive Center, for which <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like to {{continue}} working with.

5|$|It was {{announced}} in June 2013 that Dixon was expecting her first child with her partner, former backing dancer Azuka Ononye, and on her 35th birthday, 7 October 2013, she stated on Twitter that she {{had given birth to}} her daughter, Azura Sienna, the previous week. Dixon <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> put her fourth album on hold and concentrate on motherhood.|$|E
5|$|At 1:24 pm, Murray emailed a work {{supervisor}} of the nursing school faculty {{that she would be}} out of town for a week due to a death in her family; no one in her family had died. She also <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> contact them when she returned. At 2:05 pm she called a number which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The call lasted approximately five minutes. At 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend and left a voice message promising him they would talk later. This call ended after one minute.|$|E
5|$|Despite the one-sided {{national}} loss in 1984, Ferraro {{was still}} viewed as {{someone with a}} bright political future. Many expected her {{to run in the}} 1986 United States Senate election in New York against first-term Republican incumbent Al D'Amato, and during 1985 she did Upstate New York groundwork towards that end. A Senate candidacy had been her original plan for her career, before she was named to Mondale's ticket. But in , she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not run, due to an ongoing U.S. Justice Department probe on her and her husband's finances stemming from the 1984 campaign revelations.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> but {{the tone}} in which <b>she</b> <b>said</b> it, hardly gave {{confirmation}} to her promise.|$|R

5|$|On September 22, 2017, Chelsea Manning {{was denied}} entry to Canada from the United States {{because of her}} {{criminal}} record. According to a letter from Canadian immigration officials, posted online by Manning, she is inadmissible due to being convicted of offenses equivalent to treason in Canada. Manning told Reuters that she had planned to vacation in Montreal and Vancouver, but was stopped at a Quebec border crossing by the Canada Border Services Agency {{on the evening of}} September 21 and detained overnight. She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> retain a Canadian lawyer to challenge the inadmissibility finding before a Canadian tribunal.|$|E
5|$|The {{first version}} of the Gorgon, Medusa, was to have five feet, but due to {{perceived}} animation difficulties, the final version had one tail. Other Gorgons in the game adhered to this design. The goddess Artemis was considered for inclusion in God of War: Ascension as a playable female character, offering alternative combat options. Game Director Todd Papy <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have been depicted as half-human and half-feline, with the head and torso of a woman and the legs of a lioness. However, she was ultimately cut from the game and thus only appears in the original God of War as a translucent head.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E

5|$|Rob Minkoff entered {{negotiations}} {{to take the}} director's position in October 2001, and Gwyn Lurie was hired {{to start from scratch}} on a new script in February 2002. Lurie <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> adapt the original book and ignore the 1971 film adaptation. Dahl's estate championed Lurie after being impressed with her work on another Dahl adaptation, a live-action adaptation of The BFG, for Paramount Pictures, which was never made (Paramount distributed the earlier 1971 film version of Charlie, and later sold the rights to WB). In April 2002, Martin Scorsese was involved with the film, albeit briefly, but opted to direct The Aviator instead. Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn wanted Tom Shadyac to direct Jim Carrey as Willy Wonka, believing the duo could make Charlie and the Chocolate Factory relevant to mainstream audiences, but Liccy Dahl opposed this.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} {{having sex with}} Tammy, Ron comes to work wearing a red shirt and black pants, which prompts Tom to observe that Ron always dresses like golf pro Tiger Woods after having sex. This joke was written before the story of Woods' extramarital affairs scandal broke in the news in November 2009. Andy {{is said to have}} auditioned for the reality {{television}} show Survivor and the television game show Deal or No Deal. During an audition tape, he is shown gutting a fish to prove he could perform on Deal or No Deal, even though the action is far more appropriate for Survivor. During one scene, to Leslie's shock and confusion, Tammy <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> rather be Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, than Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady and wife of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E

5|$|Twelve-year-old Keith Bennett {{vanished}} {{on his way}} to his grandmother's {{house in}} Longsight, Manchester, early in the evening of 16 June 1964, four days after his birthday. Hindley lured him into her Mini Pick-up—which Brady was sitting in the back of—by asking for the boy's help in loading some boxes, after which she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> drive him home. She drove to a lay-by on Saddleworth Moor as she and Brady had previously arranged, and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove. Hindley kept watch, and after about 30minutes or so Brady reappeared, alone and carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier. When Hindley asked how he had killed Bennett, Brady said that he had sexually assaulted the boy and strangled him with a piece of string.|$|E
5|$|Aaron Copland wrote Connotations {{to fulfill}} a {{commission}} from Leonard Bernstein for the opening concert of the New York Philharmonic's new home in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Since this hall was slated as {{the first part of}} Lincoln Center for completion, its inauguration was considered especially momentous. Among the guest list of 2600 for the first concert and the white-tie gala which would follow it were John D. Rockefeller III (chairman of Lincoln Center), Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Governor and Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller, United Nations Secretary General U Thant and prominent figures in the arts that included of Metropolitan Opera General Manager Rudolf Bing, violinist Isaac Stern and actress Merle Oberon. Noted composers would also attend included Samuel Barber, Henry Cowell, Roy Harris, Walter Piston, Richard Rodgers, William Schuman and Roger Sessions. United States President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie had also been invited. Their initial inability to attend caused some consternation, since they had voiced their support for American culture. At the last minute, Jackie Kennedy <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be there.|$|E
5|$|Johansson {{played the}} cyborg, supersoldier Motoko Kusanagi in Rupert Sanders's 2017 film {{adaptation}} of the Ghost in the Shell franchise. The film received mixed reviews: it was praised for its visual style, acting, and cinematography but was controversial for whitewashing the cast, particularly Johansson's character. Responding to the criticism, she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never play a person of another race, but wanted to use this rare opportunity to star in a franchise with a female protagonist. The film grossed $169.8million worldwide against a production budget of $110million. In March 2017, Johansson hosted Saturday Night Live for the fifth time, making her the 17th person, and the fourth woman (after Candice Bergen, Drew Barrymore, and former cast member Tina Fey) to enter the NBC sketch comedy series' prestigious Five-Timers Club. In the black comedy film Rough Night (2017), Johansson played Jess Thayer, {{one of the five}} friends—alongside Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell, Ilana Glazer, and Zoë Kravitz—whose bachelorette party goes wrong after a male stripper dies. Despite mixed critical reception for the film, it had moderate box office returns.|$|E
