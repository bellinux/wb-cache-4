5|$|In 2013, it was {{announced}} that exports of the Commodore would resume to North America {{in the form of the}} VF Commodore as the Chevrolet SS <b>sedan</b> for the 2014 model year. The Chevrolet SS <b>Sedan</b> was imported to the United States (but again, not to Canada) again for 2015 with only minor changes, notably the addition of Magnetic Ride Control suspension and a Tremec TR-6060 manual transmission. For the 2016 model year, the SS <b>sedan</b> received a facelift based on the VF Series II Commodore unveiled in September 2015.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sedan</b> was {{situated}} on the east bank of the Meuse River. Its capture would give the Germans a base from which to capture the Meuse bridges and cross the river. Should this occur, the German divisions could then advance across the open and undefended French countryside, beyond <b>Sedan,</b> and to the English Channel. On 12 May, <b>Sedan</b> was captured without resistance. In the following days, the Germans defeated the French defences surrounding <b>Sedan</b> {{on the west bank}} of the Meuse. This was largely achieved by the Luftwaffe. As a result of German bombing and low morale, the French defenders were unable to mount a coherent defence. The Germans captured the Meuse bridges at <b>Sedan</b> allowing them to pour forces including armour across the river. On 14 May, the Allied air forces, the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Armée de l'Air (French Air Force) tried to destroy the bridges, and prevent German reinforcements reaching the west bank. The Luftwaffe prevented them from doing so. In large air battles, the Allies suffered high losses which depleted Allied bomber strength in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Toyota {{chairman}} Eiji Toyoda {{issued a}} challenge to build the world's best car. The project, code-named F1 (“Flagship One”) developed the Lexus LS 400 to expand Toyota’s product line in the premium segment. The F1 project followed the Toyota Supra sports car and the premium Toyota Mark II models. Both the Supra and Mark II were rear-wheel drive cars with a powerful 7M-GE or 7M-GTE inline-six engine. The largest <b>sedan</b> Toyota built {{at the time was}} the limited-production, 1960s-vintage Toyota Century, a domestic, hand-built limousine, and V8-powered model, followed by the inline-six-engined Toyota Crown premium <b>sedan.</b> The Century was conservatively styled for the Japanese market and along with the Crown not slated for export after a restyle in 1982. The F1 designers targeted their new <b>sedan</b> at international markets and began development on a new V8 engine.|$|E

Internationals are appointed with launch VE Calais V alloy wheels, front foglamps, a six-disc CD changer, leather upholstered trim and steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist. Holden reintroduced the International in October 2009. Offered in <b>sedan</b> and Sportwagon body styles, the second iteration was fitted with the 3.0-litre SIDI V6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission; a 3.6-litre LPG Alloytec V6 engine with four-speed automatic transmission option {{was available for}} the <b>sedan</b> only. Extra features include 18-inch alloy wheels, Berlina front grille, leather seat trim and steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist for the <b>sedan</b> (already standard on Sportwagons).|$|E
5|$|Lexus {{originated}} from a corporate project {{to develop a}} new premium <b>sedan,</b> code-named F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the Lexus LS in 1989. Subsequently, the division added <b>sedan,</b> coupé, convertible and SUV models. Lexus did not exist as a brand in its home market until 2005, and all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque and an equivalent model name. In 2005, a hybrid version of the RX crossover debuted and additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup. Lexus launched its own F marque performance division in 2007 with the debut of the IS F sport <b>sedan,</b> followed by the LFA supercar in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of <b>Sedan</b> or Second Battle of <b>Sedan</b> (12–15 May 1940) was a Second World War battle fought {{during the}} French Campaign. The battle {{was part of}} the German Wehrmachts {{operational}} plan codenamed Fall Gelb (Case Yellow) for an offensive through the hilly and heavily forested Ardennes, to encircle the Allied armies in Belgium and north-eastern France. German Army Group A crossed the Meuse river with the intention of capturing <b>Sedan</b> and pushing northwards towards the Channel coast, in order to entrap the Allied forces that were advancing east into Belgium, as part of the Allied Dyle Plan strategy.|$|E

5|$|The German High Command did {{not want}} to exploit the victory at <b>Sedan</b> and Bulson until the German {{infantry}} divisions had caught up with the three Panzer divisions. To Guderian, this was madness and would throw away the victory at <b>Sedan</b> and allow the enemy time to recover and reorganise his still formidable armoured units. Guderian decided to push for the Channel, even if it meant ignoring the High Command and Hitler himself. Guderian ordered the 10th Panzer Division and Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment to hold the <b>Sedan</b> bridgehead, while the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions struck north west, towards the Channel. Now that they were pushing largely at an 'open door', the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions advanced into the undefended French rear with speed.|$|E
5|$|The {{crossing}} of the Meuse enabled the Germans {{to break into the}} strategic depths, or undefended rear, of the Allied front and to advance to the English Channel without significant opposition. The French attempted to launch counter-attacks against the German-held bridgeheads, from 15–17 May, but the offensives fell victim to delay and confusion. Five days after consolidating their bridgeheads at <b>Sedan,</b> on 20 May, the German Army reached the Channel. The victory at <b>Sedan</b> achieved the operational goal of Fall Gelb and encircled the strongest Allied armies, including the British Expeditionary Force. The resulting battles destroyed the remaining French army as an effective fighting force, and expelled the British Army from the continent, leading to the defeat of France in June 1940. The battle at <b>Sedan</b> was instrumental in the fall of France.|$|E
5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The steep slopes {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable barrier of bunkers and defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing <b>Sedan</b> as the point of maximum effort. To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team of photographic specialists were called in to evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the construction sites of half-built bunkers that were, to all intents and purposes, empty shells. The contribution of the specialists tilted the <b>Sedan</b> attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{more exotic}} Ferraris, Maseratis and Alfas, the more humble fare of Fiat 600s, 1100 <b>sedans,</b> 850 {{standard}} and Bertone 128 coupes and <b>sedans,</b> and 124 <b>sedans</b> were offered, Alfettas and Lancia <b>sedans</b> were also produced. Among the most endearing Mercurys were the smaller scooters like the APE with delivery box, Lambretta delivery and solo scooter and the ubiquitous Vespa (Force 1992, 50). Construction and farm vehicles were also offered.|$|R

5|$|Development of the LS {{began in}} 1983 as the F1 project, the code {{name for a}} secret {{flagship}} <b>sedan.</b> The resulting <b>sedan</b> followed an extended five-year design process {{at a cost of}} over US$1 billion, and premiered with a new V8 engine and numerous luxury features. The Lexus LS was intended from its inception for export markets, and the Lexus division was formed to market and service the vehicle internationally. The original LS 400 debuted to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.|$|E
5|$|Guderian's {{plan for}} 13 May was straightforward. The 2nd Panzer Division {{in the north}} was to form the right flank of the assaulting force when it reached the Meuse near Donchery. The 1st Panzer Division, {{reinforced}} by the Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland, a battalion of assault engineers, and divisional artillery of the 2nd and 10th Panzer Divisions, {{was to make the}} main attack by crossing the Meuse just north of <b>Sedan</b> and seizing the Heights of la Marfee overlooking the city. The 10th Panzer Division was to cross the Meuse south of <b>Sedan</b> and protect the southern flank of the corps. Throughout the day, large masses of troops and equipment assembled north of the Meuse in preparation for the river crossing.|$|E
25|$|Production was: 5,603 Kammbacks, 17,340 Liftbacks, 2,378 two-door <b>sedans,</b> 1,737 four-door <b>sedans,</b> and 10,371 station wagons for a {{total of}} 37,429 units.|$|R

5|$|Holden's {{designers}} and engineers began laying down {{the basics of}} a clean-sheet Commodore <b>sedan</b> in 1999. In the seven years of development, the car came to be Holden's largest and most expensive project, representing an expenditure exceeding A$1billion and 3.4millionkilometres (2.1millionmiles) of testing.|$|E
5|$|Holden's {{standardisation}} of six airbags in March 2008 for MY09 {{made the}} VE {{eligible for the}} ANCAP side pole test, yielding additional scoring points. The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n energy absorbing steering column shroud and redesigned rear door latches across the VE range. The inclusion of a seat belt reminder on the Omega <b>sedan</b> yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega <b>sedan</b> to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a seat belt reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the seat belt reminder as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE <b>sedan</b> and Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Lexus began {{sales of}} the GS 450h, a V6 hybrid {{performance}} <b>sedan,</b> and launched the fourth generation LS line, comprising both standard- and long-wheelbase V8 (LS 460 and LS 460 L) and hybrid (LS 600h and LS 600h L) versions. The fifth generation ES 350 also debuted in the same year. The LS 600h L subsequently went on sale as the most expensive <b>sedan</b> ever produced in Japan. By the end of 2006, Lexus' annual sales had reached 475,000 vehicles worldwide. In January 2007, Lexus announced a new F marque performance division, which would produce racing-inspired versions of its performance models. The IS F, made its debut at the 2007 North American International Auto Show, accompanied by a concept car, the LF-A.|$|E

30|$|For this work, we {{consider}} three vehicle classes: cars, vans, and taxis. Classes like bus, semi, and motorcycle {{were not included}} because they are relatively easy to classify based on their size. We considered three different scenarios: cars vs vans, <b>sedans</b> vs taxis, and <b>sedans</b> vs vans vs taxis. Taxis and <b>sedans</b> are disjoint subsets of class cars. Therefore, results of <b>sedans</b> vs taxis will demonstrate the relevance of our approach when inter-class variability is low. For {{the purpose of this}} paper, we used a dataset provided in [4].|$|R
50|$|The {{shape and}} {{position}} of the automobile greenhouse on both two- and four-door <b>sedans</b> may be identical, with only the center B-pillar positioned further back to accommodate the longer doors on the two-door versions. For example, 1962 Rambler Classic <b>sedans</b> feature identical windshield, A-pillar, roof, C-pillar, and rear window. The two-door <b>sedans</b> have longer doors and include roll down rear side window and even a quarter window that is shaped to follow the reverse slant of the C-pillar, just like on the rear doors of the four-door <b>sedans.</b>|$|R
5|$|SS V-Series Special Edition: {{following}} the 2009 cancellation of Pontiac brand in North America, the Pontiac G8 front-end fascia and other trimmings were fitted to approximately 1,500 Commodore SS Vs. Unveiled at the 2009 Deniliquin ute muster on 2 October, sales began in November. Unlike the G8 {{which was only}} offered as a <b>sedan,</b> Holden issued utility, <b>sedan</b> and Sportwagon body variants of the Special Edition. Due to {{the popularity of the}} Pontiac-inspired SS V, Holden announced on 14 January 2010 that production would be extended until March 2010.|$|E
5|$|The French {{defeat at}} <b>Sedan</b> left the Allied Army Groups in Belgium with sparse flank protection. The German attack, {{especially}} the breakout from the bridgeheads at <b>Sedan,</b> was {{so fast that}} there were hardly any major combats. Many French soldiers were in such shock that they were taken prisoner before they could offer resistance, which also explains the low casualty rates for both sides. The two assault engineer battalions under Korthals achieved the most important success. By eliminating the bunkers in the Bellevue sector, they made the breakthroughs of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions possible. This was achieved without a single casualty.|$|E
5|$|The Futura model gained power {{adjustable}} pedals, {{and side}} airbags, with a DVD entertainment system being offered on upmarket trim levels. The XR8 <b>sedan</b> variant also received the premium audio system.|$|E
50|$|When {{the gunmen}} receive their ransom, they demand {{a fleet of}} identical-looking <b>sedans</b> {{be brought to the}} cathedral. The NYPD {{provides}} the <b>sedans</b> with the intent of using snipers to kill each gunman as he exits the cathedral. Unfortunately, everyone emerges from the cathedral dressed identically in hoods and robes—it is impossible to differentiate gunman from hostage. The hostages and gunmen pile into each of the <b>sedans</b> and drive off. Bennett and the NYPD and FBI follow from helicopters as the <b>sedans</b> travel a route that the gunmen had demanded be blocked off.|$|R
