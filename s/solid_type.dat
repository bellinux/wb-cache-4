6000|$|The {{contained}} protoplasm of a vegetal cell, {{which has}} self-mobility and when liberated sometimes performs amoeba-like motions for a time, may {{be regarded as}} an imprisoned amoeba; and when we pass from it to a free amoeba, {{which is one of}} the simplest types of first animals, or Protozoa, we naturally meet with kindred phenomena. The general trait which here concerns us, is that while its plastic or semi-fluid sarcode goes on protruding, in irregular ways, now this and now that part of its periphery, and again withdrawing into its interior first one and then another of these temporary processes, perhaps with some small portion of food attached, there is but an indistinct differentiation of outer from inner (a fact shown by the frequent coalescence of the pseudopodia in Rhizopods); but that when it eventually becomes quiescent, the surface becomes differentiated from the contents: the passing into an encysted state, doubtless in large measure due to inherited proclivity, being furthered, and having probably been once initiated, by the action of the medium. The connexion between constancy of relative position among the parts of the sarcode, and the rise of a contrast between superficial and central parts, is perhaps best shown in the minutest and simplest Infusoria, the Monadin√¶. The genus Monas is described by Kent as [...] "plastic and unstable in form, possessing no distinct cuticular investment; ... the food-substances incepted at all parts of the periphery";[45] and the genus Scytomonas he says [...] "differs from Monas only in its persistent shape and accompanying greater rigidity of the peripheral or ectoplasmic layer."[46] Describing generally such low forms, some of which are said to have neither nucleus nor vacuole, he remarks that in types somewhat higher [...] "the outer or peripheral border of the protoplasmic mass, while not assuming the character of a distinct cell-wall or so-called cuticle, presents, as compared with the inner substance of that mass, a slightly more <b>solid</b> <b>type</b> of composition."[47] And it is added that these forms having so slightly differentiated an exterior, [...] "while usually exhibiting a more or less characteristic normal outline, can revert at will to a pseud-amoeboid and repent state."[48] Here, then, we have several indications of the truth that the permanent externality of a certain part of the substance, is followed by transformation of it into a coating unlike the substance it contains. Indefinite and structureless in the simplest of these forms, as instance again the Gregarina,[49] the limiting membrane becomes, in higher Infusoria, definite and often complex: showing that the selection of favourable variations has had largely to do with its formation. In such types as the Foraminifera, which, almost structureless internally though they are, secrete calcareous shells, it is clear that the nature of this outer layer is determined by inherited constitution. But recognition of this consists with the belief that the action of the medium initiated the outer layer, specialized though it now is; and that even still, contact with the medium excites secretion of it.|$|E
6000|$|Johnson, however, is {{the only}} member of that illustrious company who can profitably be {{compared}} with Burke in strength and impressiveness of personality, in a large sensibility at once serious and genial, in brooding care for all the fulness of human life. This striking pair were the two complements of a single noble and <b>solid</b> <b>type,</b> holding tenaciously, in a century of dissolvent speculation, to the best ideas of a society that was slowly passing. They were powerless to hinder the inevitable transformation. One of them did not even dimly foresee it. But both of them help us to understand how manliness and reverence, strength and tenderness, love of truth and pity for man, all flourished under old institutions and old ways of thinking, into which the forces of the time were even then silently breathing a new spirit. The friendship between Burke and Johnson lasted as long as they lived; and if we remember that Johnson was a strong Tory, and declared that the first Whig was the devil, and habitually talked about cursed Whigs and bottomless Whigs, it is an extraordinary fact that his relations with the greatest Whig writer and politician of his day were marked by a cordiality, respect, and admiration that never varied nor wavered. [...] "Burke," [...] he said in a well-known passage, [...] "is such a man that if you met {{him for the first time}} in the street, where you were stopped by a drove of oxen, and you and he stepped aside to take shelter but for five minutes, he'd talk to you in such a manner that, when you parted, you would say, This is an extraordinary man. He is never what we would call humdrum; never unwilling to begin to talk, nor in haste to leave off." [...] That Burke was as good a listener as he was a talker, Johnson never would allow. [...] "So desirous is he to talk," [...] he said, [...] "that if one is talking at this end of the table, he'll talk to somebody at the other end." [...] Johnson was far too good a critic, and too honest a man, to assent to a remark of Robertson's, that Burke had wit. [...] "No, sir," [...] said the sage, most truly, [...] "he never succeeds there. 'Tis low, 'tis conceit." [...] Wit apart, he described Burke as the only man whose common conversation corresponded to his general fame in the world; take up whatever topic you might please, he was ready to meet you. When Burke found a seat in Parliament, Johnson said, [...] "Now we who know Burke, know that he will be one of the first men in the country." [...] He did not grudge that Burke should be the first man in the House of Commons, for Burke, he said, was always the first man everywhere. Once when he was ill, somebody mentioned Burke's name. Johnson cried out, [...] "That fellow calls forth all my powers; were I to see Burke now it would kill me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Set screws are {{not always}} {{the best way to}} resist the torque of driven shafts. To reduce the chance of {{slipping}} and to increase load capacity, a detent (often called a [...] "flat") may be milled or ground at the part of the shaft where the set screw's point contacts. The detent, however, must be closely aligned with the threaded hole prior to fastening. The operator can often feel the screw push the flat into final alignment as he or she makes the last half- or quarter-turn that tightens the screw. Set screws can successfully hold against heavy-torque applications if the details are right. For example, endmill holders of the <b>solid</b> <b>type</b> typically use large set screws holding against flats to fasten the endmill, and heavy loads are resisted. However, small set screws without flats are prone to spinning and galling if overloaded. The use of keys and keyways instead of, or in combination with, set screws is common for applications requiring high torque resistance or transmission. Splines offer yet more strength.|$|E

In this work, we study the nucleation of AB(2) <b>type</b> <b>solid</b> compounds using Monte Carlo molecular simulations in binary hard sphere mixtures with the size ratio of 0. 55. The conditions chosen for the study lie in the region where nucleation of an AB(2) <b>type</b> <b>solid</b> competes with that of a pure A solid with a face-centered-cubic structure. The fluid phase composition is kept equal to that of the AB(2) <b>type</b> <b>solid.</b> The nucleation free-energy barriers are computed using the seeding technique of Sanz et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 135, 15008 (2013) ]. Our simulation results show that the nucleation of the AB(2) <b>type</b> <b>solid</b> is favored even under conditions where the pure A solid is more stable. This is primarily due to the similarity in the composition of the fluid phase and the AB(2) <b>type</b> <b>solid</b> which in turn leads to much lower interfacial tension between the crystal nucleus and the fluid phase. This system {{is an example of how}} the fluid phase composition affects the structure of the nucleating solid phase during crystallization and has relevance to crystal polymorphism during crystallization processes.

BCC arising from radiotherapy treatment has high incidence and its clinical and histopathological features may be different from BCCs caused by other carcinogens. The aim of our study was to investigate any possible association between specific histopathological or clinical features and chronic radiation dermatitis as the cause of BCC. In this study, 87 patients with previous history of radiotherapy on the site of BCC (exposed) were selected as group A and matched with 87 other patients with BCC without such a history as group B (unexposed). The two groups were compared based on certain clinical features such as size, number and location of the tumors and also based on the histopathological features. In the exposed group, the most frequent histopathological type was pigmented <b>solid</b> <b>type</b> (73. 5 %), while in the unexposed group <b>solid</b> <b>type</b> (66. 7 %) was the most frequent feature. Multiple tumors were found in 86. 2 % of the exposed patients, while just 12. 6 % of the unexposed patients had multiple tumors. In the unexposed group, the face was the most frequent location (94. 3 %) and the mean size was 1 cm in diameter, while in the exposed group the most frequent location was the scalp and the mean size was 0. 5 cm.

30|$|UA {{presents}} some distinguishing and characteristic features {{because it}} is observed in a rather younger age group [1, 8, 9] than conventional ameloblastoma, which is rarely observed in younger populations [10, 11]. Radiographically, the unilocular pattern is more common than the multilocular pattern, particularly in cases associated with tooth impaction [1, 8]. Impacted mandibular third molars are even frequently associated with UA [8]. It also usually appears very similarly to a non-neoplastic odontogenic cyst and is frequently misdiagnosed as a dentigerous cyst or an odontogenic keratocyst. Therefore, histologic confirmation with biopsy is mandatory [9, 11, 12].
