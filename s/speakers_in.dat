5|$|Q'anjob'al {{is spoken}} by 77,700 in Guatemala's Huehuetenango department, with small populations elsewhere. The region of Q'anjobalan <b>speakers</b> <b>in</b> Guatemala, due to genocidal {{policies}} during the Civil War and its {{close proximity to}} the Mexican border, was the source of a number of refugees. Thus there are now small Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek, and Awakatek populations in various locations in Mexico, the United States (such as Tuscarawas County, Ohio and Los Angeles, California), and, through postwar resettlement, other parts of Guatemala. Jakaltek (also known as Popti') is spoken by almost 100,000 in several municipalities of Huehuetenango. Another member of this branch is Akatek, with over 50,000 <b>speakers</b> <b>in</b> San Miguel Acatán and San Rafael La Independencia.|$|E

5|$|According to a rough estimation, as of 2010 {{there were}} up to 300,000 Swedish-speakers living outside Sweden and Finland.

A considerable majority of Swedish residents born outside Sweden (c. 1.5 million) speak Swedish and according to the ELDIA Project, there were c. 2,390,000 second-language <b>speakers</b> <b>in</b> Finland. According to a survey by the European Commission, 44% of respondents from Finland who did not have Swedish as a native language considered themselves to be proficient enough in Swedish to hold a conversation, for a total of about 5 million second-language speakers. The total number of native speakers could be up to 8.6 million with an additional 4–5 million second language <b>speakers</b> <b>in</b> Sweden and Finland. Due to the close relation between the Scandinavian languages, a considerable proportion of speakers of Danish and especially Norwegian are highly fluent in Swedish for a total number of speakers that could be as high as 15 million.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{this was}} not the case. For most of its history, ain't was {{acceptable}} across many social and regional contexts. Throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, ain't and its predecessors were part of normal usage for both educated and uneducated English speakers, and was found in the correspondence and fiction of, among others, Jonathan Swift, Lord Byron, Henry Fielding, and George Eliot. For Victorian English novelists William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope, the educated and upper classes in 19th century England could use ain't freely, but in familiar speech only.

5|$|In the past, the Hebrides {{as a whole}} were {{a strong}} Scottish Gaelic-speaking area, and in 1921 more than 50% of the populations of most of these islands, {{including}} Skye, Mull and Islay, were proficient in the language.

5|$|Incorrect {{figures are}} {{sometimes}} cited {{for the population}} of ASL <b>speakers</b> <b>in</b> the United States based on misunderstandings of known statistics. Demographics of the deaf population have been confused with those of ASL use, since adults who become deaf late in life rarely use ASL in the home.

A 100,000-person lower bound has been cited for ASL users; {{the source of this}} figure is unclear, but it may be an estimate of prelingual deafness, which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing.|$|E
