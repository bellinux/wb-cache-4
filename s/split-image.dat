5000|$|Acute Matte {{focusing}} screen with <b>split-image</b> bi-prism surrounded by microprisms. Four screens available, replaced by technician.|$|E
50|$|A {{coincidence}} rangefinder (stereoscopic, parallax, or <b>split-image</b> rangefinder) {{is a type}} of rangefinder that uses mechanical and optical principles to allow an operator to determine the distance to a visible object.|$|E
50|$|Focusing screens, {{in their}} {{simplest}} form, {{consist of a}} matte glass or plastic surface on which the image can be focused. Other devices, such as <b>split-image</b> prisms or microprisms, can help determine focus.|$|E
5000|$|Focusing screens: the {{standard}} focusing screen, ground-glass with <b>split-image</b> and microprism collar, {{can be replaced}} by any of five other screens for specialised tasks. For the Digital Modul R, an additional set of six screens marked with the Modul R's sensor crop area can be substituted.|$|E
5000|$|The FM has a [...] "full information" [...] viewfinder. In {{addition}} to the metering LEDs; the viewfinder also displays the set shutter speed and lens aperture to give context to the LEDs. A fixed K-type focus screen with 3 mm <b>split-image</b> rangefinder and 1 mm microprism collar is fitted.|$|E
50|$|With {{a reflex}} finder, you can focus {{the image on}} the ground glass and frame your picture at the same time. It is common to find a device on the center of the ground glass to help precise focusing, for example a <b>split-image</b> or a microprism device. Today's reflex cameras usually {{incorporate}} autofocusing.|$|E
50|$|The {{body was}} {{available}} with a chrome or black finish {{on the upper}} parts and base (the central body being always black). There was a special edition called ME Super SE, only sold in chrome finish; the differences are the SE marking and the diagonal instead of horizontal <b>split-image</b> device in the focusing screen.|$|E
50|$|Some {{sophisticated}} 20th century cameras {{with direct}} viewfinders had coincidence (<b>split-image)</b> rangefinders, initially with separate windows from the viewfinder, later integrated with it; {{they were called}} rangefinder cameras. Cameras with interchangeable lenses had to indicate {{the field of view}} of each lens in the viewfinder; more usually, interchangeable viewfinders to match the lenses were used.|$|E
5000|$|The camera {{offers the}} {{convenience}} of image composition with wide open aperture. The aperture is stopped down to the selected value after the shutter is released. After exposure the mirror stays up until the bottom-mounted {{single-stroke film advance lever}} is again wound. Focusing is via a ground glass screen with a central <b>split-image</b> rangefinder.|$|E
50|$|Uniquely amongst Canon EOS bodies it had {{an optical}} manual focus aid, a <b>split-image</b> {{focusing}} screen {{as well as a}} ring of microprisms. This system was common with manual focus SLRs but had since fallen out of use in the autofocus era. The screen can be installed in several autofocus EOS cameras, and can only be obtained by purchasing a used EF-M.|$|E
50|$|The {{camera is}} {{equipped}} with the newly developed Prontor-Compur (PC) reflex shutter, which would {{pave the way for}} reputable camera designs such as the 1953 Contaflex, the 1956 Retina Reflex, the 1957 Hasselblad 500, and the 1959 Voigtl√§nder Bessamatic. However, it does not have the built-in eye-level pentaprism finder, which was first seen on 35mm SLR cameras in 1949. Instead, it has a waist-level finder with a central <b>split-image</b> rangefinder complemented by large full frame magnifier incorporating a central loupe that covers the rangefinder central area.|$|E
50|$|The Type 051 Retina Reflex IV {{was made}} from 1964 to 1967. It has a {{characteristic}} little window {{in the front of}} its pentaprism housing, which displays the aperture in use in the viewfinder. A hot shoe replaced the accessory shoe of the Reflex III. The frame counter now automatically resets to 36 when the back is opened; the frame advance slider is used to set the counter for shorter rolls. The <b>split-image</b> rangefinder on the ground glass is now at a 45 degree angle.|$|E
5000|$|The Autoreflex T3"N" [...] or [...] "New" [...] {{introduces}} iterative enhancements {{by replacing}} the earlier version's accessory hot-shoe with a fixed hot-shoe, adding a viewfinder-ocular shutter, and an optional <b>split-image</b> focusing-screen (that feature being indicated by a round sticker {{with a large}} letter [...] "S" [...] and the caption [...] "split image" [...] below the rewind-crank next to the viewfinder ocular on the top back of the camera). The T3N's serial number is painted {{and moves to the}} top of the top-plate between the rewind-lever and prism-bump.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{standard}} micro-prism center focusing screen, four other focusing screens are available and could be refitted into the body (plain, grid, grid with micro-prism, <b>split-image</b> {{as well as the}} standard). Due {{to the fact that the}} installation of a screen required a qualified technician and then re-calibrate the new screen the camera, it is rare to find screens other than the standard version. The micro-prism screen is adequate or usable down to f4.5 lenses, however, the more desired split screen is capable of operating down to f5.6 before the center going black.|$|E
50|$|There were {{a variety}} of models {{beginning}} in 1972 with the original SX-70, though all shared the same basic design. The first model had a plain focusing screen (the user {{was expected to be}} able to see the difference between in- and out-of focus) because Dr. Land wanted to encourage photographers to think they were looking at the subject, rather than through a viewfinder. When many users complained that focusing was difficult, especially in dim light, a <b>split-image</b> rangefinder prism was added. This feature is standard on all later manual focus models.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the final}} year or two of production, another version of the {{optional}} <b>split-image</b> focusing-screen became available, which featured the split image dot {{in the center and}} a [...] "donut" [...] of micro-diaprisms around that, both of which were {{in the center of the}} matte focus screen. Models fitted with the special screen feature had a small silver tag stuck on the back with [...] "S.I." [...] printed on it. The final version of focus screen became the standard on all subsequent Konica models (TC, T4, FP-1, FT-1, etc.) ...|$|E
50|$|Another popular {{camera was}} the CM-1, a basic, fully manual 35 mm SLR camera favored by student amateur photographers {{because it was}} cheaper than the rival Pentax K-1000, but could use the same lenses and accessories. The CM-1 {{featured}} a battery-powered through-the-lens light metering system that utilized a red-above, green-middle, and red-below to indicate whether the shutter speed/aperture setting was over/ok/under exposing the picture. It also used a <b>split-image</b> prism for determining when an image was properly focused. The CM-1 was sold through discount retailers such as K-Mart during the 1980s and proved to be very durable and reliable. Chinon branded products were sold in the UK through the Dixons high-street chain in the same period.|$|E
50|$|A {{rangefinder}} {{camera is}} a camera {{fitted with a}} rangefinder, typically a <b>split-image</b> rangefinder: a range-finding focusing mechanism allowing the photographer to measure the subject distance and take photographs that are in sharp focus. Most varieties of rangefinder show two images of the same subject, one of which moves when a calibrated wheel is turned; when the two images coincide and fuse into one, the distance can be read off the wheel. Older, non-coupled rangefinder cameras display the focusing distance and require the photographer to transfer the value to the lens focus ring; cameras without built-in rangefinders could have an external rangefinder fitted into the accessory shoe. Earlier cameras of this type had separate viewfinder and rangefinder windows; later the rangefinder was incorporated into the viewfinder. More modern designs have rangefinders coupled to the focusing mechanism, so that the lens is focused correctly when the rangefinder images fuse; compare with the focusing screen in non-autofocus SLRs.|$|E
5000|$|Immediately {{following}} the 1967 merger, {{the newly created}} SCL network had 1,232 locomotives. The {{vast majority of the}} ACL roster contained EMD locomotives, while the SAL rostered Baldwin and ALCO diesels in addition to EMD builds. Both railroads had purchased new freight locomotives in the 5 years leading up to the merger. Among the first new locomotives purchased by the Seaboard Coast Line were 28 GE U33B locomotives, acquired in 1967 and 1968. These were followed by 108 GE U36B locomotives between 1970 and 1972. From EMD, SCL purchased SD45 locomotives in 1968, with more to follow in 1971. SD45-2 locomotives were added in 1974. GP40 and GP40-2 locomotives were added to the fleet between 1968 and 1972 for use on through freights and other high priority freight trains. All former SAL locomotives ran for many years in the [...] "Split-image" [...] scheme, still in full SAL paint, but relettered & renumbered SCL. Two GP-7's 915 & 981 went from pure SAL to SCL Black without being in <b>split-image</b> and GP-7 944 and RS-3 1156 were never painted black, and retained their SAL paint until retired in 1976. The last operating SCL locomotive in SAL paint was GP-40 1559, former SAL 644, and was repainted at Hamlet,N.C. in March 1976 according to records. There were former P&N locomotives that retained their P&N scheme from 1069 until 1977, only RS-3's 1250 & 1256 and S-4 230 ever were repainted SCL black.|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{simulations}} of three concepts, based on maximum use of available off-the-shelf hardware elements, are described. The concepts are a stereo-foveal-peripheral TV system with symmetric steroscopic <b>split-image</b> registration and 90 deg counter rotation; a computer assisted model control system termed the trajectory following control system; and active manipulator damping. It is {{concluded that the}} feasibility of these concepts is established...|$|E
40|$|For {{the future}} linear {{accelerator}} TESLA the demanded accuracy for the {{alignment of the}} components is 0. 5 mm horizontal and 0. 2 mm vertical, both on each 600 m section. Other accelerators require similar accuracies. These demands can not be fulfilled with open-air geodetic methods, mainly because of refraction. Therefore the RTRS (Rapid Tunnel Reference Surveyor), a measurement train performing overlapping multipoint alignment on a reference network is being developed. Two refraction-free realizations of this concept are being developed at the moment: the first one (GeLiS) measures the horizontal co-ordinates using stretched wires, combined with photogrammetric <b>split-image</b> sensors in a distance measurement configuration. In areas of the tunnel where the accelerator is following the earth curvature GeLiS measures the height using a new hydrostatic leveling system. The second concept (LiCAS) is based on laser straightness monitors (LSM) combined with frequency scanning interferometry (FSI) in an evacuated system. LiCAS measures both co-ordinates with respect to its LSM-beam and is thus suitable for geometrically straight tunnel sections. Both measurement systems will be placed on a train, which could do the reference survey autonomously...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{physiology}} and pathophysiol-ogy of {{cerebral blood flow}} (CBF) {{is essential to the}} proper treatment of patients with major intra-cranial disease. Yet much of the existing informa-tion is fragmented and incoherent (1 - 4); certainly many problems remain unsolved. This review has attempted to organize the ex-isting knowledge about CBF into a reasonably consistent framework of facts and concepts. The available, accurate, relatively simple methods of measuring CBF are discussed first and then the na-ture and control of CBF in health and disease are considered. Hopefully, this integrated presenta-tion will facilitate the evaluation of new informa-tion. MEASUREMENT OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW Pial Artery Diameter. ‚ÄîMeasuring pial artery diameter is a classical method of assessing varia-tions in CBF, but acid-base changes, trauma, and hypothermia or hypoxia of the exposed cortical sur-face must be avoided because such conditions tend to abolish the normal vasomotor reactions. By using the <b>split-image</b> television technique, varia-tions of a few percent in internal diameter can be recorded (5). In combination with micropipette application of test fluid in minute amounts on the arterial wall, this technique affords a direct way of studying the pharmacology of the brain arteries in vivo (6) without the complications resulting from systemic drug effects. Drug effects secondary to alterations in brain tissue function can also be avoided, since it is possible to study arteries that do not touch brain tissue so that the test fluid reaches the artery only. This technique also cir-cumvents the blood-brain barrier (the endothelium of the brain vessels) and allows the effects of very high local drug concentrations to be studied. For both reasons, caution must be used when th...|$|E
