40|$|The {{acceptance}} of penalty <b>shoot-outs</b> in the knockout stages of international football tournaments {{is based on}} the belief that they have face validity by involving a football skill, that they have a clear and quick decision criterion that settles the result shortly after the end of the game, and that they do not offer any in-built advantage to either of the competing nations. Following events in the 2006 World Cup, we decided to investigate whether there are grounds to believe that the results of penalty <b>shoot-outs</b> are predetermined. Specifically, we considered whether characteristics of national cultures explain the results of penalty <b>shoot-outs</b> and whether penalty <b>shoot-outs</b> offer an advantage to any nation...|$|R
