5|$|The {{octagonal}} font {{dates from}} the 15th century; its carved panels alternate images of the symbols of the Four Evangelists with seated figures of the Doctors of the Church (Saint Ambrose, Saint Augustine, Saint Jerome, and Pope Gregory I). The central column carries shields depicting the Instruments of the Passion and the Holy Wounds. The eastern shield is unusual in that a sword is shown with an ear stuck to it. This refers {{to the story of}} Saint Peter <b>striking</b> <b>off</b> the ear of Malchus, the High Priest's servant, in the garden of Gethsemane.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{from the}} Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) of the British Department for Transport {{concluded}} that {{the nose of the}} aircraft was effectively blown off, and was separated from the main section within three seconds of the explosion. The nose cone was briefly held on by a band of metal but facing aft, like the lid of a can. It then sheared off, up and backwards to starboard, <b>striking</b> <b>off</b> the No. 3 engine and landing some distance from Lockerbie, near Tundergarth church.|$|E
25|$|Like a canter, {{the horse}} will strike off with its non-leading hind foot; {{but the second}} stage of the canter becomes, in the gallop, the second and third stages because the inside hind foot hits the ground a split second before the outside front foot. Then both gaits end with the <b>striking</b> <b>off</b> of the leading leg, {{followed}} by a moment of suspension when all four feet are off the ground. A careful listener or observer can tell an extended canter from a gallop by the presence of the fourth beat.|$|E

25|$|Seeking {{to atone}} for his past wrongdoings, Matsuōmaru plots to save Kan Shūsai's life, {{at the cost of}} that of his own son, Kotarō. He sends Kotarō to the school, where Genzō and Tonami decide he is the only one at the school whose head could pass for Kan Shūsai's. This scene {{is a classic example of}} the {{conflict}} between giri (honor, fealty) and ninjō (human compassion), as Genzō and Tonami sacrifice an innocent boy to save their master's son. When the sound of Genzō's sword <b>striking</b> <b>off</b> Kotarō's head is heard from offstage, Matsuōmaru strikes a distinctive Matsuō mie pose, expressing his suppressed anguish. He then departs with the head in a box, to identify it for Shihei as Kan Shūsai's head, pretending to have done the deed and thus saving Kan Shūsai's life.|$|E
25|$|Heima, {{tied up with}} rope, reveals Shihei's plot {{to seize}} power, {{describing}} each detail and he bemoans his fate, having failed in his mission to kill Kan Shōjō, and having been captured. Hearing of Shihei's treachery, Kan Shōjō becomes enraged, breaking off a branch from the plum tree and <b>striking</b> <b>off</b> Heima's head with it, {{as if it were}} a sword. He asks Shiradayū and Umeōmaru to hurry to the capital, to warn the emperor of Shihei's plans. Knowing that he cannot return to the capital himself, at least not in body, having been formally exiled, he vows to return as an angry spirit. To that end, he vows to journey to the summit of Mount Tenpai, where he will engage in austere disciplines, swear oaths to the gods, and become a ghostly lord of thunders. As he speaks, a storm rises up. His retainers grasp at his sleeves and try to stop him, but he throws them off, and flies off into the sky, already beginning to transform into a thunder spirit.|$|E
2500|$|These tactics worked {{especially}} well against the British. British leaders, especially Eden and the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Louis Mountbatten {{were afraid of}} being labelled [...] "murderers and baby killers", and sincerely attempted to limit Egyptian civilian deaths. Eden frequently interfered with Revise Phase I and II bombing, <b>striking</b> <b>off</b> various targets that he felt were likely to cause excessive civilian deaths, and restricted the gun sizes {{that could be used}} at the Port Said landings, again to minimize civilian deaths.|$|E

2500|$|In some parishes in England the centuries-old {{tradition}} of announcing a death on a church bell is upheld. In {{a small village}} most people would be aware of who was ill, and so broadcasting the age and sex of the deceased would identify them. To this end the death was announced by telling (i.e. single blows with the bell down) the sex and then <b>striking</b> <b>off</b> the years. Three blows meant a child, twice three a woman and thrice three a man. After a pause the years were counted out at approximately half-minute intervals. The word teller in some dialects becomes tailor, hence the old saying [...] "Nine tailors maketh a man".|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the death}} of the God Emperor Leto II, {{humanity}} had been thrown into chaos.
