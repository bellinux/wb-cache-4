5|$|Hazel and Augustus {{arrive in}} Amsterdam and are {{presented}} with reservations at an expensive restaurant, pre-paid by Van Houten. During the meal, Augustus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they go to Van Houten's house, but are shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic. Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner without Van Houten knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant's actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers {{to a piece of}} fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly distraught. Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience. The three visit the Anne Frank House, where Hazel struggles to climb the house's many stairs. They <b>spend</b> <b>that</b> night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal. Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.|$|E

Discretionary spending {{is used to}} fund the Cabinet Departments (e.g., the Department of Education) and Agencies (e.g., the Environmental Protection Agency), although these are often the recipients of some mandatory funding as well. Discretionary budget authority is established annually by Congress, as opposed to mandatory <b>spending</b> <b>that</b> is required by laws that span multiple years, such as Social Security or Medicare.|$|R
25|$|The Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) {{performed}} an analysis, estimating that in 2012 the average plant gate costs (including 10% profit margin, but excluding blending and transport) of primary recovery was $30.32/bbl, of SAGD was $47.57/bbl, of mining and upgrading was $99.02/bbl, and of mining without upgrading was $68.30/bbl. Thus, {{all types of}} oil sands projects except new mining projects with integrated upgraders {{were expected to be}} consistently profitable from 2011 onward, provided that global oil prices remained favourable. Since the larger and more sophisticated refineries preferred to buy raw bitumen and heavy oil rather than synthetic crude oil, new oil sands projects avoided the costs of building new upgraders. Although primary recovery such as is done in Venezuela is cheaper than SAGD, it only recovers about 10% of the oil in place versus 60% or more for SAGD and over 99% for mining. Canadian oil companies were in a more competitive market and had access to more capital than in Venezuela, and preferred to <b>spend</b> <b>that</b> extra money on SAGD or mining to recover more oil.|$|E

Snedden was an efficiency expert and former printer who had been employed by Henry Kaiser during WWII. After the war, he began troubleshooting newspapers. Through 1949 and 1950, Snedden did an efficiency study of the News-Miner and recommended about $100,000 in upgrades. Lathrop was unwilling to <b>spend</b> <b>that</b> much on the newspaper, and Snedded suggested that if Lathrop was unwilling to upgrade, Snedden would be interested in purchasing the paper. The two men worked out a verbal agreement before Lathrop was killed in a coal train accident.|$|E
500|$|By May, Perot {{was leading}} presidential polls in both Texas and California. The Bush and Clinton campaigns became {{concerned}} about a candidacy, and publicly wondered if Perot could continue to [...] "play by his own rules". They attempted to downgrade Perot from his [...] "folk hero status" [...] {{to that of a}} politician, by highlighting his [...] "alleged character flaws". Meanwhile, Perot focused on sharpening his political positions as he promised. He hired John P. White, who served as a budget official under President Jimmy Carter, to work on his budget platform. Meanwhile, petition drives in every state reported that they had secured enough signatures to place Perot on the Election Day ballot. Speculation arose in the media that Perot would split the electoral college and force the United States House of Representatives to decide the presidency. Around this time, Hal Riney, who had worked on Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign and was known for the [...] "Morning in America" [...] ad, was hired as advertising consultant. When Riney revealed the cost of advertisements during a meeting, Perot reportedly [...] "flipped out", and asked [...] "Why would I <b>spend</b> <b>that</b> when I could go on the 'Today' show for free?" [...] Riney produced several ads during the campaign that never aired.|$|E

500|$|The free-associative [...] "Champion" [...] is {{primarily}} composed of motivational lyrics, but West also briefly {{touches on the}} strained relationship he had with his father–who divorced from his mother {{when he was just}} three-years-old–eventually reaching the conclusion that even with their ups and downs, in the end, his father was a champion in his eyes. West described [...] "Stronger" [...] as an [...] "emancipation", as he uses the song to vent his frustration over mistakes he has made in the past. He describes his tribulation's with music critics and media causing his return as a [...] "Stronger" [...] rapper, as the song title implies. [...] "I Wonder" [...] carries an introspective tone, retaining a chorus about finding one's dreams, while West uses the verses to describe the struggle a person experiences in determining the meaning behind their life and achieving those dreams. Inspired by watching Bono open stadium tours, West concentrated on speaking volumes without using too many words on the song and delivers his raps in an exuberant, staccato manner. Using the same vocal stylings, [...] "Flashing Lights" [...] tells the operatic narrative of man contemplating the complexities of a tragic relationship. [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothing" [...] serves as West's reflection on his fame and is characterized by bitter remorse and defiant self-awareness. West begins the song by expounding his conflicted feelings regarding wealth and desire, describing a compulsion to <b>spend</b> <b>that</b> overwhelms any and all other objectives in life. He ties this into his perceived overall inability to keep himself together even as he grows into an increasingly prominent figure in the public eye.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Abbott brothers, {{frontman}} Phil Anselmo began behaving strangely and distanced {{himself from}} the band {{when they returned to}} the road in 1995.
