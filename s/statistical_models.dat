5|$|Beginning with William Stanley Jevons and Clément Juglar in the 1860s, economists {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} cycles of frequent, violent shifts in economic activity. A key milestone in this endeavor was {{the foundation of the}} U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research by Wesley Mitchell in 1920. This marked the beginning of a boom in atheoretical, <b>statistical</b> <b>models</b> of economic fluctuation (models based on cycles and trends instead of economic theory) that led to the discovery of apparently regular economic patterns like the Kuznets wave.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} theorise {{that the}} galactic tide {{may have contributed}} to the formation of the Oort cloud by increasing the perihelia (smallest distances to the Sun) of planetesimals with large aphelia (largest distances to the Sun). The effects of the galactic tide are quite complex, and depend heavily on the behaviour of individual objects within a planetary system. Cumulatively, however, the effect can be quite significant: up to 90% of all comets originating from the Oort cloud may be the result of the galactic tide. <b>Statistical</b> <b>models</b> of the observed orbits of long-period comets argue that the galactic tide is the principal means by which their orbits are perturbed toward the inner Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Tropical cyclone {{forecasting}} also {{relies on}} {{data provided by}} numerical weather models. Three main classes of tropical cyclone guidance models exist: <b>Statistical</b> <b>models</b> are based on an analysis of storm behavior using climatology, and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast that {{is not based on}} the physics of the atmosphere at the time. Dynamical models are numerical models that solve the governing equations of fluid flow in the atmosphere; they are based on the same principles as other limited-area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the cyclone. Models that use elements of both approaches are called statistical-dynamical models.|$|E

50|$|A <b>statistical</b> <b>model</b> is {{a special}} class of {{mathematical}} model. What distinguishes a <b>statistical</b> <b>model</b> from other mathematical models is that a <b>statistical</b> <b>model</b> is non-deterministic. Thus, in a <b>statistical</b> <b>model</b> specified via mathematical equations, some of the variables do not have specific values, but instead have probability distributions; i.e. some of the variables are stochastic. In the example above, ε is a stochastic variable; without that variable, the model would be deterministic.|$|R
40|$|Cracks {{are one of}} {{the hidden}} dangers in {{concrete}} dams. The study on safety monitoring models of concrete dam cracks has always been difficult. Using the parametric <b>statistical</b> <b>model</b> of safety monitoring of cracks in concrete dams, {{with the help of the}} semi-parametric statistical theory, and considering the abnormal behaviors of these cracks, the semi-parametric <b>statistical</b> <b>model</b> of safety monitoring of concrete dam cracks is established to overcome the limitation of the parametric model in expressing the objective model. Previous projects show that the semi-parametric <b>statistical</b> <b>model</b> has a stronger fitting effect and has a better explanation for cracks in concrete dams than the parametric <b>statistical</b> <b>model.</b> However, when used for forecast, the forecast capability of the semi-parametric <b>statistical</b> <b>model</b> is equivalent to that of the parametric <b>statistical</b> <b>model.</b> The modeling of the semi-parametric <b>statistical</b> <b>model</b> is simple, has a reasonable principle, and has a strong practicality, with a good application prospect in the actual project...|$|R
5|$|From these models, {{researchers}} also predict that bee populations will start declining most {{significantly in the}} southern latitudes with lagging range expansion in the north. Kerr and his colleagues found that as the climate has shifted, bumblebees {{have been forced to}} operate outside of their thermal ranges, causing range losses along the species’ southern limits. However, the study also found that while other flora and fauna have expanded their northerly ranges to account for the climate shifts, bumblebees have not expanded farther north. The most important findings in this study came from <b>statistical</b> <b>models</b> built to study whether or not these range shifts were due to confounding factors such as pesticide use or changes in land cover. The researchers found that climate change had the most meaningful impact on range shifts and bee distributions. To support these findings, the scientists note that failure for the bumblebee to respond to thermal changes and expand their northern range underscores the idea that bumblebees are susceptible to climate change.|$|E
