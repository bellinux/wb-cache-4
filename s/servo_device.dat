40|$|Abstract. The {{complete}} {{stress-strain curve}} of rock is obtained mostly by the rock mechanics tester. So the rock mechanic tester is quite important in industry. It provides the scientific data for engineering design and construction. But {{the material of}} rock is made of special complex natural structure. It {{is very hard to}} obtain the complete and true performance data of rock by the common material tester which causes rock broken easily. The main cause lies on the slow response of control system, the bad performance and rigidity. In order to solve the question, this paper studies the rock mechanics tester intelligent control by computer electro-hydraulic <b>servo</b> <b>device</b> by means of computer technologies, electromechanical integration technologies and hydraulic technologies.

40|$|ARM Automation, Inc. is {{developing}} a framework of modular actuators that can address the DOE's wide range of robotics needs. The objective of this effort is to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of this}} technology by constructing a manipulator from these actuators within a glovebox for Automated Plutonium Processing (APP). At the end of the project, the system of actuators was used to construct several different manipulator configurations, which accommodate common glovebox tasks such as repackaging. The modular nature and quickconnects of this system simplify installation into ''hot'' boxes and any potential modifications or repair therein. This work focused on the development of self-contained robotic actuator modules including the embedded electronic controls for the purpose of building a manipulator system. Both of the actuators developed under this project contain the control electronics, sensors, motor, gear train, wiring, system communications and mechanical interfaces of a complete robotics <b>servo</b> <b>device.</b> Test actuators and accompanying DISC{trademark}s underwent validation testing at The University of Texas at Austin and ARM Automation, Inc. following final design and fabrication.

We present one- and two-stage amplification mechanisms which provide a guided translational output in one axis.

40|$|Electric power {{steering}} (EPS) systems are important ingredients of modern cars. Basing on mechanic (steering mechanism), electric (electric motor), electronic (controller) and mechatronic (sensors) components, they are typical <b>servo</b> mechanic <b>devices,</b> which support drivers handling action. The paper presents mathematical modelling of EPS systems treated as multi body mechanisms with power assistance, including strong non-linear phenomena {{caused by a}} friction (especially in king-pins) and a feeplay (in gear-box).

An increasing number of long distance regatta sailors are using wind vane self-steering because of the fact, that the sails are always kept in optimal angle towards the wind, and hence the speed of the boat is kept at the possible maximum.|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the hysteresis characteristics of a pneumatic braking system for multi-axle heavy vehicles (MHVs). Hysteresis affects emergency braking performance severely. The fact that MHVs have a large size and complex structure leads to more nonlinear coupling property of the pneumatic braking system compared to normal two-axle vehicles. Thus, theoretical analysis and simulation are not enough when studying hysteresis. In this article, the hysteresis of a pneumatic brake system for an eight-axle vehicle in an emergency braking situation is studied based on a novel test bench. A <b>servo</b> drive <b>device</b> is applied to simulate the driver’s braking intensions normally expressed by opening or moving speed of the brake pedal. With a reasonable arrangement of sensors and the NI LabVIEW platform, both the delay time of eight loops and the response time of each subassembly in a single loop are detected in real time. The outcomes of the experiment show that the delay time of each loop gets longer {{with the increase of}} pedal opening, and a quadratic relationship exists between them. Based on this, the pressure transient in the system is fitted to a first-order plus time delay model. Besides, the response time of treadle valve and controlling pipeline accounts for more than 80 % of the loop’s total delay time, indicating that these two subassemblies are the main contributors to the hysteresis effect...|$|R
40|$|The neuromuscular control {{comparison}} between {{flexion and extension}} of the upper extremities has been conducted {{in a number of}} studies. It has been speculated that differences in the corticospinal pathway between flexion and extension {{may play a role in}} the cortical difference detected between flexion and extension, resulting in higher cortical activation for extension. However, it is still unclear as to what roles these pathways play, and to what degree other factors (muscle force activation, sensory feedback, frequency of movement, structural and/or functional differences) might influence the cortical activation in the brain. It has been speculated that the difference in cortical muscular pathways is due to flexion movements being used more often in day to day activities, therefore requiring less cortical activation for that movement. Through the investigation of the cortical differences present during different movement types, a deeper understanding into the differences between flexion and extension may be obtained. No previous study has compared the cortical differences between flexion and extension of the upper extremities during different movement types. In this study, an offline investigation is conducted between wrist flexion and extension, during real, passive and motor imaginary movement with the help of a <b>servo</b> controlled hand <b>device.</b> Simultaneous recording of EEG, EMG and wrist dynamics (velocity, angle, strain) were made on fifteen healthy right handed subjects performing 60 randomized repartitions of right wrist flexion and extension, for kinaesthetic motor imaginary, passively moved, and voluntary real active movements. Real movements were conducted at 10 % relative subject maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). A <b>servo</b> controlled hand <b>device</b> was used to regulate dynamic force applied for real movements, and provide motion during passive movements. The use of different movement types with the aid of a <b>servo</b> controlled hand <b>device,</b> may give a deeper understanding into the effects of muscle force activation, rate of movement and corticospinal pathway on flexion and extension. In order to investigate the cortical differences between flexion and extension, subjects perceived difficulty, movement dynamics, movement related cortical potential (MRCP), event related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS), and phase locking value (PLV) were measured. Each measurement examines a different aspect of the cortical activation present in the brain, during the different movement types. Although relative muscle force activation between wrist real flexion and extension was similar, the motor cortex activation during extension was higher than during flexion, by MRCP and mu-band ERD, with subjects also perceiving real wrist extension to be more difficult to perform. Passive movements found higher motor cortex activation for flexion (MRCP, beta-band ERD), however higher somatosensory cortical activation was present during extension, by mu-band ERS and PLV. Motor imagined wrist flexion showed higher cortical activation during wrist flexion, by MRCP and beta-band ERD. Although numerous variables were tested (each in difference frequency bands), with some being significant and others being non-significant, overall it can be suggested that there was higher cortical activation for extension. The higher cortical activation during wrist extension movements may be due to corticospinal and somatosensory motor control pathways to motor neuron and from sensory neuron pools for extensor/flexor muscle and muscle spindle of the upper extremities. This investigation contributes to the current literature relating to cortical differences between flexion and extension of the upper extremities, by including the real, passive and motor imaginary differences between flexion and extension...|$|R

40|$|Role of {{obstruction}} in autosomal dominant {{polycystic kidney disease}} in rats. Kidney micropuncture and microdissection {{studies were carried out}} on heterozygous 2 - to 4 -month-old female and male Han:SPRD rats with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and on normal controls, to determine whether cysts are obstructed. Pressures in proximal tubules and cysts were determined using a <b>servo</b> null <b>device</b> and were recorded before, during, and after intraluminal infusion of an isotonic equilibrium solution at 15 and 50 nl/min. Initial cyst pressures in nine cystic rats averaged 18. 5 ± 5. 9 (SD) mm Hg, N = 49, significantly (P < 0. 01) higher than in normal proximal tubules in four control rats, 14. 3 ± 1. 6 mm Hg, N = 36. Pressures in non-cystic tubules in cystic rats, 16. 8 ± 4. 4 mm Hg, N = 25, were not significantly different from pressures in control kidneys or in cysts. When proximal tubules were microinfused at 15 nl/min in control rats, tubule pressure increased by 3. 8 ± 1. 2 mm Hg, N = 24. In cysts, the response was highly variable. Twenty out of 33 microinfused cysts (61 %) showed responses similar to normal tubules and were considered to be nonobstructed; 13 (39 %) showed large pressure increases upon microinfusion, sometimes to values over 100 mm Hg (obstructed cysts). Left kidney inulin clearance (in µ 1 /min · 100 g body wt) averaged 335 ± 65 (N = 4) in control rats and 344 ± 144 (N = 9) in cystic rats; at this early stage of the disease no decline in GFR was seen. Weights of cystic kidneys were twice those of normal animals. Microdissection and scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of intraluminal casts and debris and constrictions between cysts that would impede fluid flow. We conclude that obstruction is a frequent, early event in PKD and, when present, promotes cyst enlargement. Since many cysts are not obstructed, we suggest that factors other than fixed obstruction initiate cyst formation...|$|R
40|$|Moog, Inc., Schaeffer Magnetics Division, is {{currently}} developing a miniature pan/tilt mechanism called the Orbital Pointing <b>Servo</b> (OPS). This <b>device</b> {{is designed to}} point a small camera or sensor anywhere within a +/- 45 -degree optical cone at slew rates of up to 1100 degrees/second. Most pan/tilt mechanisms involve a motion-on-motion design, in which one motor controls one axis of motion while a second larger motor moves the first motor along with the payload in the other axis. The OPS is inherently more efficient in size, weight, speed, and power because the payload is mounted on a true ring-in-ring gimbal and controlled in both axes simultaneously by a single integrated mechanism. While the OPS can be operated open loop, specially designed position sensors integrated directly into the gimbal itself provide position feedback for closed loop control. Aside from generally improving performance beyond the open loop characteristics, closed loop operation would allow the OPS to be used autonomously {{as part of a}} self-reliant vision system, or could reject vibrations and disturbances on a mobile robot to stabilize the image. The OPS could also be used to point a mirror for beam steering, small thrusters for thrust vector control, or various types of sensors...|$|R
40|$|Relation of distal tubular NaCl {{delivery}} and glomerular hydrostatic pressure. We have tested {{certain aspects of}} the hypothesis that the rate of distal tubular sodium delivery determines the rate of filtration in that nephron. Schnermann, Wright et al have suggested that a reduction in distal sodium delivery causes the local release of angiotensin which acts to elevate the glomerular hydrostatic pressure (PG) of that nephron by constricting the efferent arteriole, thereby increasing the nephron filtration rate. We have, therefore, examined the influence of distal sodium delivery upon glomerular hydrostatic pressure utilizing a <b>servo</b> null pressure <b>device</b> in Wistar rats with surface glomeruli on normal NaCl diet (Group I), low NaCl diet (Group II) and during saline diuresis (Group III). Glomerular pressure was quite similar in all three groups. In single nephron studies, in these same three groups, an acute reduction in distal sodium delivery did not alter nephron glomerular hydrostatic pressure. We conclude: 1) mechanisms exist whereby PG is autoregulated despite acute tubular obstruction and wide variations in distal sodium delivery; 2) if nephron filtration rate rises with reduction in distal sodium delivery, this must be mediated by increased plasma flow to that nephron, since glomerular hydrostatic pressure is unchanged...|$|R

5000|$|In former Trim-Tab servo systems, {{the pivot}} {{movement}} of the servo blade around its vertical axis {{has been carried out}} by a trim tab Servo tab, which however costs some force due to the fact, that the trim tab is moved in the opposite direction to turn the servo blade.The same holds for a trim trim tab, which is mounted at a big distance behind the ship's rudder, connected to it at its upper and lower end. This construction is called [...] "The Saye's Rigg". Another version of wind vane self steering on sail boats is known as the vertical axis vane and usually, because of the inferior steering force output compared to <b>Servo</b> Pendulum <b>devices</b> it makes use of a trim tab hung off the rudder to control the course of the boat. The vane spins at right angles to the ground and can lock to the trim tab in any desired position, as the boat falls off the wind the vane will be turned by the wind and will take the trim tab with it which in turn causes the rudder to move in the opposite direction and thus corrects course. Generally self steering like this, with a trim tab can only be used on boats with transom (or aft hung double enders) rudders as the trim tab needs to be mounted directly to and aft of the rudder to produce the desired effect, and of course has to be controlled even as the rudder swings side to side. This is typically accomplished by use of a slotted bar in which the connection to the vane assembly can slide in as the rudder turns. These self steering systems are generally simpler and are thus easier to set and adjust course as they don't make use of lines controlling the rudder but control it more directly through solid linkages.A related device has been used on some windmills, the fantail, a small windmill mounted at right angles to the main sails which automatically turns the heavy cap and main sails into the wind, (invented in England in 1745). (When the wind is already directly into the main vanes, the fantail remains essentially motionless.) ...|$|R
