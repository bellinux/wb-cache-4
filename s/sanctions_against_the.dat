Warelwast was unable to change the pope's mind, but he did manage to prevent <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> king. Henry also employed Warelwast as a papal envoy during the Canterbury–York disputes over the primacy in the English Church, with visits in 1119, 1120, and possibly also in 1116.|$|E
5|$|The Bosnian War {{began in}} 1992, {{as a result}} of the breakup of Yugoslavia.

From June 1993 until October 1996, Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and economic <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the no-fly zone.|$|E
5|$|Fans' {{behaviour}} {{at international}} games {{has led to}} various <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> national team. Croatia was penalized and threatened with expulsion from UEFA for reports of racist behaviour by travelling fans at Euro 2004. UEFA and FIFA have both penalized the Croatian Football Federation (HNS) for similar incidents in the past. During a friendly match against Italy in Livorno, {{a small group of}} Croatia fans formed the shape of a swastika. Croatian fans were also heavily scrutinized for racist behavior against Turkey in 2008, as well as an incident of racial abuse towards English striker Emile Heskey in 2010. During the 2006 World Cup a Croatian fan evaded security at a German venue and approached Croatian players on the field; he was arrested and banned for trespassing. There were also reports of violent clashes between Croatian and Turkish supporters at Euro 2008, as well as improper conduct by Croatia fans at Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup.|$|E

25|$|According to {{international}} observers, the current Iranian regime (led by Ali Khamenei since 1989) is oppressive, with {{human rights abuses}} commonplace. Since the 2000s, Iran's controversial nuclear program has raised concerns, {{which is part of}} the basis of the international <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> country. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement reached between Iran and the P5+1, was created on July 14, 2015, aimed to loosen the nuclear sanctions in exchange for Iran's restriction in producing enriched uranium.|$|E

The decision, together with Hadrian's other <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Jews, was allegedly {{one of the reasons for}} the eruption of the 132 Bar Kokhba revolt — an extremely violent uprising.

25|$|The Democratic Party {{has been}} {{critical}} of the Iran's nuclear weapon program and supported economic <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Iranian government.

It avoided any reference to economic aid suspensions or other <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> regime, thereby allowing the Ngô family to change policy without a public loss of face.|$|E

This evidence was supported by QCPD Traffic Sector Police Officer 2 Renato Sunga. According to Sunga, as based on the investigation, the Commuters Bus unit {{was responsible for the}} traffic violation because the driver stopped the bus outside the loading/unloading bay to load/unload the passengers.|$|R

In August 1998, {{in the wake of}} the East Africa embassy bombings, the U.S. launched cruise missile strikes against Khartoum. The last U.S. Ambassador to the Sudan, Ambassador Tim Carney, departed post prior to this event and no new ambassador has been designated since. The U.S. Embassy is headed by a charge d'affaires.|$|E
25|$|One {{prominent}} case {{occurred in}} October 2011 {{when the first}} person in Mali was prosecuted on allegations of slavery for exploiting Iddar Ag Ogazide. Temedt pressured for the case and provided financial assistance to Ag Ogazide's family during the difficult period. After a first hearing in which the accused claimed that he had paid Ag Ogazide for his work, the trial was delayed when the judge had to flee Gao for his safety. With the Tuareg Rebellion and the military coup, the case has been delayed further. The organization also pushes the government to further criminalize slavery and add additional <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> practice and works with anti-slavery organizations in other countries and with Anti-Slavery International to coordinate efforts.|$|E
25|$|Mismanagement and {{corruption}} resulted in major economic problems. By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the economy was deteriorating because of a combination of overspending on a festival to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the regime, overspending to purchase privately owned sugar mills and electricity plants, and a decision to make a major investment in state sugar production that proved economically unsuccessful. In 1956, Trujillo's agents in New York murdered Jesús María de Galíndez, a Basque exile who had worked for Trujillo but who later denounced the Trujillo regime and caused public opinion in the United States to turn against Trujillo. In August 1960, the Organization of American States (OAS) imposed diplomatic <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Dominican Republic as a result of Trujillo's complicity in an attempt to assassinate President Rómulo Betancourt of Venezuela.|$|E
