40|$|Legionella {{bacteria}} are ubiquitous in natural matrices and man-made systems. However, {{it is not}} always clear if these reservoirs can act as source of infection resulting in cases of Legionnaires' disease. This review provides an overview of reservoirs of Legionella reported in the literature, other than drinking water distribution systems. Levels of evidence were developed to discriminate between potential and confirmed sources of Legionella. A total of 17 systems and matrices could be classified as confirmed sources of Legionella. Many other man-made systems or natural matrices were not classified as a confirmed source, since either no patients were linked to these reservoirs or the supporting evidence was weak. However, these systems or matrices could {{play an important role in}} the transmission of infectious Legionella bacteria; they might not yet be considered in <b>source</b> <b>investigations,</b> resulting in an underestimation of their importance.

To provide quantitative information interference of monopolar CPM and ICD by EAS systems operating at 8. 2 MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (EMF) investigations have been performed by exposing numerical anatomical models of pacemaker patients with implants at the conventional left or right pectoral sites and at the abdomen to magnetic fields of a simulated EAS gate <b>source.</b> <b>Investigation</b> of normal position in the centre and worst case with the back next to the gate showed that adverse interference such as inadequate sensing need not be expected at any position.

40|$|Fine {{sediment}} inputs into river {{systems can}} be {{a major source of}} nutrients and heavy metals and have a strong impact on water quality and ecosystem functions of rivers and lakes, including those in semiarid regions. However, little is known to date about the spatial distribution of sediment sources in most large scale river basins in Central Asia. Accordingly, a sediment source fingerprinting technique was used to assess the spatial sources of fine-grained ( 0. 97) and were subsequently used for numerical mass balance modelling with uncertainty analysis. The contributions of the individual sub-catchment spatial sediment sources varied from 6. 4 % (the headwater sub-catchment of Sugnugur Gol) to 36. 2 % (the Kharaa II sub-catchment in the middle reaches of the study basin), generally showing higher contributions from the sub-catchments in the middle, rather than the upstream, portions of the study area. The importance of river bank erosion is shown to increase from upstream to midstream tributaries. The source tracing procedure provides results in reasonable accordance with previous findings in the study region and demonstrates the applicability and associated uncertainties of the approach for fine-grained sediment <b>source</b> <b>investigation</b> in large scale semi-arid catchments...|$|E
40|$|Aiming at the unsafe {{of water}} quality {{which is the}} core problem in rural {{drinking}} water safety, the study col-lected 221 water samples of rural drinking water sources in Ya'an and detected the concentrations of the car-cinogen and the non-carcinogen. Based on the analysis of water environment characteristics and the identifi-cation of water environment health risk source of Sichuan Ya’an City, which includes seven counties and a district and is the typical region of the western margin of Sichuan Basin, this study calculated and analyzed the carcinogenic risk (R) and non-carcinogenic risk (hazard index, HI) by applying the health risk model recommended by the US National Research Council of National Academy of Science. Then, taking advan-tage of the geo-statistic spatial analysis function of ArcGIS, this study analyzed the assessment result data (R and HI), selected the proper interpolation approach and educed R and HI spatial distribution maps of the study area. R and HI of the single factor and integrate factors were evaluated and thus obtained the following conclusions: For one thing, the cancerous risk indexes {{of the vast majority}} of water sources (about 94 %) is the level of 10 - 7 and it belong to the safety extension. The main carcinogen in the water sources are As, Cr 6 + and Pb, their concentrations are in the ranges of 0. 004 - 0. 01, 0. 005, 0. 01 mg/l respectively and such water source mainly distributed in Yucheng district and Mingshan county. For another, the non-cancerous hazard indexes of the vast majority of water sources (about 98 %) is also less than the limit value 1 and will not harm the local residents. The health risk of non-carcinogen comes mainly from As and fluoride, their concentra-tions are in the ranges of 0. 004 - 0. 01 and 0. 1 - 4. 2 mg/l respectively. The results of the integrate factors health risk assessment showed that the total cancerous risk were still at the level of 10 - 6, only 12 drinking water <b>source</b> <b>investigation</b> sites (5 %) exceeded the drinking water management standard value of EPA (the limit value is 10 - 6); the total non-cancerous hazard indexes are still in the range of 10 - 2 - 10 - 1, and will not harm the local residents either, only 18 drinking water <b>source</b> <b>investigation</b> sites (8 %) exceeded the drinking water management standard value of EPA(the limit value is 1). The densely populated areas such as Yucheng Dis-trict, Tianquan County, Yingjing County and Shimian County are where the four contaminating materials, i. e., As, Cr 6 +, Pb and fluoride should be monitored with emphasis.

40|$|Introduction Blood lead {{concentrations}} {{among children}} aged 6 years and younger become a concern at 10 µg/dL (0. 48 μmol/L) or higher. The authors’ {{objective was to}} determine whether initial blood lead concentrations of 10 – 19 µg/dL (0. 48 – 0. 96 μmol/L) declined among children aged 3 years and younger and whether the magnitude of decline was associated with the case management protocol of the state or local childhood lead poisoning prevention program. Methods The authors analyzed childhood blood lead surveillance data from 1994 through 1995 and case management protocols from six states that reported the results of all blood lead tests. The study included 2109 children aged 2 years or younger who had a venous blood lead concentration of 10 – 19 µg/dL (0. 48 – 0. 96 μmol/L) and a follow-up venous blood lead test within 3 to 12 months. Results Overall, blood lead concentrations increased by 0. 25 µg/dL (0. 01 μmol/L) between the time of the initial elevated blood lead test and the follow-up test, but concentrations declined by 1. 96 µg/dL (0. 09 μmol/L) among children covered by a case management protocol that included a home visit and by 0. 92 µg/dL (0. 04 μmol/L) among those covered by a protocol that included a lead <b>source</b> <b>investigation.</b> The decline remained significant after we adjusted for the child’s age.
