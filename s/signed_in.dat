40|$|Diagnosis in neuroimaging {{involves}} {{the recognition of}} specific patterns indicative of particular diseases. Pareidolia, the misperception of vague or obscure stimuli being perceived as something clear and distinct, is somewhat beneficial for the physician {{in the pursuit of}} diagnostic strategies. Animals may be pareidolically recognized in neuroimages according to the presence of specific diseases. By associating a given radiological aspect with an animal, doctors improve their diagnostic skills and reinforce mnemonic strategies in radiology practice. The most important pareidolical perceptions of animals in neuroimaging are the hummingbird <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> progressive supranuclear palsy, the panda <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> Wilson's disease, the panda <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> sarcoidosis, the butterfly <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> glioblastomas, the butterfly <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> progressive scoliosis and horizontal gaze palsy, the elephant <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> Alzheimer's disease and the eye-of-the-tiger <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegenerative disease...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim is {{to provide}} {{guidelines}} for the evaluation and management of adults with hypoglycemic disorders, including those with diabetes mellitus. EVIDENCE: Using {{the recommendations of the}} Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, the quality of evidence is graded very low (plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle ooo), low (plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle oo), moderate (plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle o), or high (plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle). CONCLUSIONS: We recommend evaluation and management of hypoglycemia only in patients in whom Whipple's triad [...] symptoms, signs, or both consistent with hypoglycemia, a low plasma glucose concentration, and resolution of those symptoms or signs after the plasma glucose concentration is raised [...] is documented. In patients with hypoglycemia without diabetes mellitus, we recommend the following strategy. First, pursue clinical clues to potential hypoglycemic etiologies [...] drugs, critical illnesses, hormone deficiencies, nonislet cell tumors. In the absence of these causes, the differential diagnosis narrows to accidental, surreptitious, or even malicious hypoglycemia or endogenous hyperinsulinism. In patients suspected of having endogenous hyperinsulinism, measure plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and circulating oral hypoglycemic agents during an episode of hypoglycemia and measure insulin antibodies. Insulin or insulin secretagogue treatment of diabetes mellitus is {{the most common cause of}} hypoglycemia. We recommend the practice of hypoglycemia risk factor reduction [...] addressing the issue of hypoglycemia, applying the principles of intensive glycemic therapy, and considering both the conventional risk factors and those indicative of compromised defenses against falling plasma glucose concentrations [...] in persons with diabetes...|$|R
