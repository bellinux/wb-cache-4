5000|$|Two major {{incidents}} {{happened in}} the 1980 Open Conference. The first one was the famous quote of Coach Manotoc after Game 4 of the Finals between the Wranglers and the Tamaraws. In that game, with less than 7 minutes left and the Tamaraws ahead by 11 points (U/Tex was ahead {{in the best of}} five series, 2-1), Manotoc pulled out all his starters including the two imports in an apparent sign of surrender. After the game, when asked by reporters why he gave up with so much time remaining, Manotoc quipped, [...] "one step back, two steps forward", referring to his tactic of reserving his players' energy in preparation for <b>sudden</b> <b>death</b> <b>game</b> 5. Manotoc was severely criticized for this, to the point that reporters were suggesting to then Commissioner Leo Prieto to sanction him. But two days after, Manotoc justified his actions when Game 5 went into overtime. This is when the second incident happened. Prior to the overtime, the Tamaraws were ahead by 4 points with 16 seconds left. The Wranglers overhauled this 4-point deficit, sent the game into OT, and won the series. Only 8 players suited up for U/Tex in that game, and the Wranglers were on their last ounce of strength that McDonald and Lim fainted after the game. Manotoc just gave the Euyang franchise its second title in three years. Adornado cracked the Mythical 5 for the 3rd time in his PBA career, a classic case of retribution.|$|E

If the score is tied after both teams had a possession whether the coin toss loser scored a field goal to tie it or punted it away, then {{it goes back to}} <b>sudden</b> <b>death.</b> These changes were passed in response to recent statistics that show that since 1994, teams that win the coin toss have won overtime 59.8 percent of the time, and won 34.4 percent of the time on the first possession on a field goal. This included the 2009 NFC Championship Game between the Minnesota Vikings and the New Orleans Saints where the Saints won the overtime coin toss and scored a field goal on their first possession to win the game. In May, the league decided against applying these overtime rule changes to regular season games as well, although they would eventually institute the new overtime rules in the regular season starting in 2012.
