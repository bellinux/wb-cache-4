40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} feeding {{different}} dietary levels of Dried Whole Eggs (DWE) processed by various ways during 14 - 20 wk of age {{on the performance}} <b>of</b> <b>pullets</b> up to 25 wk of age was investigated. Eggs that are not approved for human consumption were collected and then were dried at 55 C. DWE were processed byo freezing at- 18 C, freezing with boiling and autoclaving at 121 C. It {{was included in the}} pullet diets at 2. 5 ando o 5 %. There was also, a control diet that was fed without DWE. Thus, the experimental design was factorial (2 x 3) with added a control group (0 % DWE). Each diet was fed to three replicates <b>of</b> 8 <b>pullets</b> each. Pullet's performance, egg production and quality traits and absolute and relative weight of reproductive organs was studied. Growth <b>of</b> <b>pullets</b> up to 25 wk of age was not significantly affected by various processing techniques, however, age at 50 % production significantly decreased due to autoclaving compared with freezing with boiling technique. Level of 5 % DWE increased growth <b>of</b> <b>pullets</b> up to 20 wk of age and this effect diminished at 25 wk of age. Laying rate, egg weight, egg mass and Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) were significantly improved due to feeding DWE processed by freezing with boiling compared to the other methods and this was obvious within each DWE level. Age at 50 % production significantly decreased and egg production traits significantly improved due to inclusion of 5 % DWE. Egg quality traits of fresh eggs were not significantly affected by DWE level and/or technique of processing. However, freezing technique maintained better Haug...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} with the aims of determining the fluctuation in rectal temperature (RT) <b>of</b> Shaver Brown <b>pullets</b> {{and the effect of}} vitamin C or Ascorbic Acid (AA) administration on the fluctuation during the hot-dry season in the Northern Guinea Savannah zone of Nigeria. The RT of 25 experimental and 25 control pullets were measured every hour from 06 : 00 to 19 : 00 hours for three days, three days apart, with a standard clinical thermometer. The experimental pullets were individually administered orally with AA in drinking water at the dose of 52 mg kg - 1 dissolved in sterile water, while the control pullets were given only normal water, without AA addition. In experimental pullets, the lowest hourly RT of 41. 0 ± 0. 1 °C was obtained at 06 : 00 hours, while the highest value of 41. 6 ± 0. 0 °C was recorded at 14 : 00 and 15 : 00 hours (p 0. 05); but in control pullets, the relationship was positive and significant (r = 0. 655, p< 0. 05). The pullets administered with AA had consistently lower RT values than those <b>of</b> control <b>pullets.</b> It is concluded that AA administration, by modulating the body temperature <b>of</b> <b>pullets</b> during the hot hours of the day, ameliorated the thermally stressful effect of the hot-dry season.

40|$|The {{effects of}} adding vitamin A {{supplement}} (0, 6 mg retinol/kg) and sunflower oil (0, 20 g/kg) {{on the performance}} and on yolk cholesterol, fatty acid and retinol and plasma lipids, lipoproteins and retinol concentrations of laying hens were studied for 13 weeks. Pullets fed the retinol supplement had a significantly (p < 0. 05) higher egg production, egg mass, plasma retinol concentration, yolk cholesterol and retinol contents and a higher daily egg cholesterol output and a lower yolk arachidonic acid concentration than pullets fed the control diet. Weight gain, feed consumption, egg weight, yolk concentration of most fatty acids and plasma lipids and lipoproteins concentrations were not significantly affected by retinol supplementation. Sunflower oil supplementation significantly (p < 0. 01) increased yolk concentration of stearic, linoleic and arachidonic acids and decreased yolk concentration of palmitic and oleic acids. Production performance, yolk cholesterol, linolenic acid and retinol concentrations and plasma retinol, lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were not significantly affected by sunflower oil supplementation. There was a significant interaction between dietary sunflower oil and retinol supplements on egg weight. Sunflower oil supplementation significantly reduced egg weight <b>of</b> <b>pullets</b> fed the retinol diet, whilst sunflower oil supplementation increased the egg weight <b>of</b> <b>pullets</b> fed the control diet. The reduction in egg weight {{may be caused by}} the inhibitory effect of retinol on the synthesis of arachidonic acid from linoleic acid in the liver of laying he...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} fifty-four 9 -week old Bovan Nera pullets (24 in experiment 1 and 30 in experiment 2) {{to determine the effect}} of processing on the nutrient utilization of pigeonpea seed meal (PSM) and PSM-based diets by pullets. The seeds were processed either as boiled, toasted, soaked or raw (unprocessed). In experiment 2, raw or processed PSM were each included as 10 % of a maize-soybean diet. Parameters considered were DM, CP, CF and ether extract utilization of the PSM and that of PSM-based diets. Results showed that in experiment 1, processing significantly increased (P< 0. 05) CP retention <b>of</b> the <b>pullets</b> while boiled and raw PSM had significantly higher (P< 0. 05) CF utilization than toasted and soaked. In experiment 2, boiled PSM diet significantly improved (P< 0. 05) CP retention <b>of</b> the <b>pullets,</b> while soaked PSM diet significantly reduced both CP retention and CF utilization <b>of</b> the <b>pullets.</b> It was concluded that processing of pigeonpea seeds for use in pullet diets would improve CP retention and other nutrient utilization especially boiling and toasting...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} productivity of the final hybrids laying type of hens Isa Brown and Bovans Brown in different housing systems {{on the basis of}} data provided by the International Poultry Testing Station in Ústrašice. Monitoring performance of the final hybrid laying type hens consisted <b>of</b> rearing <b>pullets</b> until the age of 126 days and the laying period to 518 days of age. Hatching eggs of Isa Brown hybrid for keeping in cages had significantly higher weight and fertilization, but lower hatchability of fertilized eggs than for keeping on litter. Hybrid Bovans Brown eggs for hatching intended for keeping in cages had lower weight and lower fertilization and hatching rate of fertilized eggs than eggs for keeping on litter. At the end of 18 th week <b>of</b> rearing <b>of</b> <b>pullets</b> Isa Brown and Bovans Brown reared in cages had significantly lower body weight compared to pullets reared on litter. In pullets housed in cages feed consumption in 126 days was significantly higher compared with pullets reared on litter. During the rearing <b>of</b> <b>pullets</b> mortality was not recorded. Hybrid Isa Brown showed a higher body weight if kept in cages while hybrid Bovans Brown on litter. Both hybrids in battery cages had lower feed consumption per 1 egg and 1 feeding day. For the observed period was found higher mortality in chickens kept in cages than on litter. Hens housed in cages had lower egg production at the initial state. Both hybrids housed in cages had significantly lower intensity of laying during the first period than the laying hens housed on litter. Differences in the 2 nd laying period were slight. Hens housed in battery cages achieved the highest egg weight in the mid-laying cycle, i. e. in the 7 th the laying period. Conversely hen housed on litter achieved the highest egg weight {{at the end of the}} laying cycle, and 13 th, respectively 14 th the laying period. Shell strength gradually decreased with age in both housing systems...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the growth performance, organ weights, and selected blood parameters <b>of</b> replacement laying <b>pullets</b> (development phase) fed increasing levels of wheat bran (WB). A total of 240 70 -d-old White Leghorn pullets (Hybrid L 33) were evaluated for seven weeks. Birds were assigned to three dietary treatments according to a completely randomized design. Treatments consisted of diets containing 100 (T 1), 150 (T 2), or 200 g/kg (T 3) of WB in partial replacement of corn, with 10 replicates per treatment of eight birds per replicate. Birds fed T 2 presented higher body weight (p 0. 05). Serum concentration of triacylglycerols, cholesterol, calcium, phosphorus, hematocrit, or hemoglobin levels were not significantly different (p> 0. 05) among treatments. These findings indicate a beneficial effect of use of 150 g/kg of wheat bran on the growth performance <b>of</b> <b>pullets</b> during the development phase; however, the inclusion of this cereal up to 200 g/kg had no effect on organ weights and blood parameters...|$|R
40|$|The current {{information}} on prevalence of avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) infection in layers is fragmentary and its true impact on egg production often remains unknown or unclear. In order to draw an epidemiological picture of AMPV presence in layer flocks in Italy, a survey {{was performed on}} 19 flocks <b>of</b> <b>pullets</b> and layers based on longitudinal studies or sporadic samplings. AMPV was detected by RT-PCR, and blood samples were collected for serology by AMPV ELISA. Occurrence of respiratory signs and drop in egg production were recorded. Possible involvement of infectious bronchitis (IB) and egg drop syndrome (EDS) viruses which could have caused loss of egg production we ruled out by RT-PCR for IB virus and haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) for EDS virus. AMPV of subtype B only was found in both pullet and layer farms. Surveys <b>of</b> <b>pullets</b> showed that most groups become infected prior to the onset of lay without showing clear respiratory signs. At point of lay these groups were serologically positive to AMPV. In two layer flocks, egg drops were observed and could be strongly linked {{with the presence of}} AMPV infection. Results were correlated with AMPV vaccination programmes applied to the birds in three flocks on the same farm. Only a vaccination program which included two live and one killed vaccines gave complete protection from AMPV infection to the birds, while a single live vaccine application was not efficacious. In conclusion the current study gives an inside view of field AMPV diffusion in Italy and control in layers...|$|R
40|$|THE {{following}} {{experiment was}} ini-tiated {{to provide additional}} infor-mation on the factors affecting the growth of replacement stock on range. Parker and McSpadden (1944) revealed that lots <b>of</b> <b>pullets</b> raised on pasture were heavier, had lower mortality rates, consumed less feed, and utilized their feed more efficient-ly than those on bare range. Todd and McSpadden (1947) concluded that the supplemental green feed of pasture did not prevent parasitism, but it did appar-ently enable birds to withstand greater parasitic burdens. Todd (1948) examined four groups of birds, one group on a bare lot {{and the other three}} on variations of pasture. The present work considered standardized pastures in conjunction with degrees of restricted mash intake...|$|R

40|$|THE {{increasing}} {{day length}} during the growth period <b>of</b> winter-hatched <b>pullets</b> seems to stimulate their sexual development, resulting in smaller-bodied layers which produce smaller eggs and {{which do not}} appear to have the capacity to lay at a high rate over an extended period. Consequently, different systems of quantitative or qualitative feed re-strictions and various lighting programs have been designed in order to delay sex-ual maturity and prevent pullets from starting to lay at too early an age. A voluminous literature, reviewed ex-tensively by Biellier and Ostmann (1960), has accumulated concerning the influence of light on the regulation of ovarian activ-ity in birds. Morris and Fox (1958 a, 1960) have proposed that the rate <b>of</b> maturation <b>of</b> <b>pullets</b> is directly proportional to the rate of change in daylength experienced by them from hatching to maturity, whereas King (1961) related sexual maturity to hours of constant light received by the pullets. These contrasting concepts have given rise to two different lighting pro-grams for pullets, the "step-down step-up system " (McClary, 1960), and the "re-stricted lighting " (King, 1959).
