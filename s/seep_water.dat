40|$|This {{research}} was conducted in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA, and focuses on water chemistry and discharge of stream water. The aim {{of this research is}} to find out if there is an effect of <b>seep</b> <b>water</b> on stream water. A seep is a groundwater upwelling area that is perennial wet. <b>Seep</b> <b>water</b> has a distinct chemical composition that leads to typical vegetation in that specific area. This research uses two methods to look at the influence of <b>seep</b> <b>water</b> on stream water. One method is the tracer injection method to measure discharge. With this method sodiumchloride (NaCl) was injected into the stream with a near-instantaneous ' slug' and the electrical conductivity (EC) was measured downstream of this injection point. To see if the stream had a gain or loss of water the EC was measured at several reaches whereby the change in discharge (Î Q) could be calculated. The discharge results did not show a significant change that could be caused by the input of <b>seep</b> <b>water.</b> The second method in this research consisted of collecting water samples in spring and summer to see if the distinct chemistry of <b>seep</b> <b>water</b> had an influence on the water chemistry of a stream. Supplementary data from Zimmer et al. (2012) was used to show changes in chemistry over time and making this research complete. Also the chemical composition of stream water was not significantly influenced by the chemistry of <b>seep</b> <b>water</b> indicating that there is no connection...|$|E

30|$|This {{process is}} related to the {{formation}} of a continuous piping hole, as a result of increased action of seepage forces through the soil micropores. The initial stage of this process starts with the initiation of internal erosion, which in this case, was enhanced by concentrated seepage through the artificial drainage channel. An abrupt drop in velocity of the <b>seeping</b> <b>water</b> {{at the opposite end of}} the drainage channel, about 5  cm before the downstream slope face, reduces the pressure of the <b>seeping</b> <b>water</b> through the soil micropores. However, the erosive cycle continues as a result of high pore-water pressure, leading to a partial reduction of the shear strength of the soil, as observed at the downstream slope face in the form of a ‘wet spot’. Summarily, the numerous complex mechanisms leading to the initiation of internal erosion and subsequent development of a piping hole include (1) generation of high pore-water pressure due to the incessant action of the seepage flux, which reduces the apparent cohesion of the soil, (2) increase in seepage forces through the soil micropores, which reduces the effective stress of the soil and produces drag forces sufficient for soil particles to be detached and entrained downstream, and (3) gradual evolution of the existing micropores, essentially caused by the hydraulic shear stress exerted by the <b>seeping</b> <b>water.</b> A continuous pipe is formed through the dam once appreciable aggregates of soil particles are removed and transported downstream by the flowing water. From observation during the experiments, it was noted that at the onset of the pipe development process, the initial diameters of the developing pipes were mostly smaller than or equal to the diameter of the artificial drainage channel.|$|R
40|$|Floating, {{iron bearing}} films have been {{observed}} {{in a wide range}} of environments, including wetlands, seep waters in ground water discharge areas, small rivers and lakes. To date, knowledge about their formation and composition is scarce. We have investigated the form of iron in floating iron-rich films of different origin, including a pond and a brook, as well as <b>seep</b> <b>water</b> pools of a groundwater discharge area. Sampling sites were located in southern (pond, brook) and central (seep pools) Sweden. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS and XANES) allowed identification of the iron precipitates present in the films, without any pretreatment. The EXAFS data showed that the iron containing phase formed in the floating films varied in composition between the sites investigated. In the films from two ground water discharge areas, characterized by out-flowing iron(II) rich ground water being high in pH and low in DOC, the iron phase was completely dominated by ferrihydrite. In contrast, surface films sampled from the brook and the pond, the iron speciation showed a mixture of iron(III) -organic complexes and iron (hydr) oxide (most likely ferrihydrite). These waters were oxic and contained higher concentration of DOC than the <b>seep</b> <b>water</b> pools in the ground water discharge areas. The position of the pre-edge peak, which is sensitive to the oxidation state of iron, did not indicate occurrence of iron (II) in any of the films. Elemental composition of one film (<b>seep</b> <b>water),</b> suggested that films contained about one third of organic matter. Ferrihydrite is probably present as small particles with humic material sorbed onto surfaces or included in the particles, making the particles sufficiently hydrophobic to not settle without physical disturbance. The films are fragile and break easily down and become suspended upon disturbance. More studies are warranted in order to understand the mechanism of the formation of these fascinating films and their biogeochemical role. QC 20121203 </p...|$|E

The technology demonstration was located at a seep from the K- 1070 -C/D Classified Burial Ground at the Oak Ridge K- 25 Site. The technology demonstration was designed to evaluate the performance of {{two different types of}} cometabolic processes. In both cases, the TCE is cometabolized in the sense that utilization of a different primary substrate is necessary to obtain the simultaneous cometabolism of TCE. Trichloroethylene alone is unable to support growth and maintenance of the microorganisms. Methanotrophic (methane-utilizing) technology was demonstrated first; aromatic-utilizing microorganisms were demonstrated later. The demonstration was based on scaleup of laboratory and bench-scale prototype equipment that was used to establish the technical feasibility of the processes.

Over a transect running from low to high in the tidal zone of a beach in Mauritania, the temperature profile at various depths in the substrate, the water-table level of <b>seep</b> <b>water,</b> salt concentration of <b>seep</b> <b>water,</b> depth of the aerobic level, operative temperatures on the surface, and size distribution of crabs were assessed. In addition, resting metabolic rates, Q 10 and thermal and starvation tolerances were estimated. Going from low to high in the tidal zone, crab size and burrow depth increased. At the preferred burrowing depth, microclimatological conditions appeared to be equally favourable at all sites. At the surface, conditions were more favourable low in the tidal zone, where also food availability is sufficient to enable small crabs to forage {{in the vicinity of}} their burrows. Large crabs have higher energy requirements and are thereby forced to forage in flocks low in the tidal zone where food is probably more abundant. Low in the tidal zone, digging deeply is impossible as the aerobic layer is rather thin. Large crabs prefer living high in the tidal zone as (1) deep burrows ensure better protection against predators, (2) more time is available for digging holes and (3) the substrate is better suited for reproduction. Energy reserves in late summer ensured an average of 34 days of survival. It is argued that the allotment of energy to growth must be considerable even in reproducing animals; the rewards of growth being the disproportional increase in reproductive output with size...|$|E
40|$|Plain {{concrete}} {{lining of}} pressure tunnels are not absolutely tight and <b>water</b> can <b>seep</b> {{out of the}} tunnel. <b>Seeped</b> <b>water</b> is lost of energy in hydropower system, but can also cause serious stability problems in the surrounding rock mass.

Such increased external water pressure decreases the gradients between internal and external pressure and reduce the seepage and losses. For simulation of hydraulic mechanical interaction in the process of cracking, a coupled seepage-stress method based on the 2 D elasto-plastic finite element method (FEM) is proposed. The coupling has been carried out by superimposing results of consolidation and water flow analyses. The coupling principle produces the change of stress field and leads to change of permeability coefficient and the redistribution of the seepage field. The calculation results are compared with results of existing tunnel and with the analytical solutions.

40|$|This {{reduction}} of the suspended sediment concentration after {{the construction of the}} High Aswan Dam has increased the ability of the flowing water to erode banks and reduce their stability. Bank erosion causes a major loss of agricultural lands. Many factors affect Nile River bank erosion such as soil characteristics, bank height and slope, navigation waves, river bends, river contractions, and spur dike effects and other factors. A very important factor that affects the bank stability and it is not considered by traditional methods of slope stability analysis is the seepage forces through banks due to the differences in Nile River and subsurface water levels. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to study and to analyze the effect of <b>seeping</b> <b>water</b> from Nile banks to the river or on their stability. Most stability methods take the effect of seepage forces as the differences in own weight of different submerged slices.

Water chemistry signature prompted laboratory mesocosm studies measuring {{the effectiveness of}} sulfate-reducing bioreactors (SRBRs) for generating alkalinity and sequestering metals. Alkaline materials utilized in the SRBRs included industrial waste products such as mussel shells, nodulated stack dust (NSD) derived from the cement industry, and limestone. Organic substrate materials included post peel, a by-product from fence post manufacture, Pinus radiata bark and compost. Seven SRBRs comprised of varying substrate mixes received aerated AMD for nearly four months. AMD was sourced from the pond that collected the <b>seep</b> <b>water.</b> The SRBR containing NSD successfully removed all metals, but effluent was caustic with pH> 9. Bioreactors consisting of 20 - 30 % mussel shells were most successful at immobilizing metals and generating circumneutral effluent.

40|$|It {{is almost}} {{universal}} history that in farming a newly developed region no attention whatever {{is paid to}} maintaining the fertility of the soil. This is natural for two very obvious reasons. In the first place the pioneer has other and more pressing problems in the 2 ̆ 2 subduing 2 ̆ 2 of the new land, {{and in the second}} place such virgin soils are generally blessed with a great abundance of native fertility. New lands in an arid or semiarid region are usually especially fertile because they represent a long-time accumulation of fertility which is not possible under humid conditions. Since in a humid region the tendency for evaporation is not sufficient to remove all of the water that goes into the soil, there is always a certain excess that seeps downward to the water-table and is later removed by springs and rivers. This <b>seep</b> <b>water</b> constantly carries away a certain amount of the soluble salts that serve as food for plants. In an arid climate, on the other hand, the evaporating tendency is more than sufficient to remove all the water that goes into the soil so that the ultimate movement of the soil moisture is upward. This soil moisture leaves all its soluble material at the surface as it evaporates, and thus there is an accumulation of mineral plant-food. (This accumulation of soluble material at the surface may become excessive, in which case we have 2 ̆ 2 alkali 2 ̆ 2 -but that is another problem.) On the other hand, the organic matter or 2 ̆ 2 humus 2 ̆ 2 of the soil contains most of the nitrogen (one of the most important plant-foods), and this does not move with the water but rather is lost by slow oxidation or burning up, so that this element of plant-food is lost more rapidly from the well-aerated soils of the arid region than from soils in a humid climate...|$|E

Due to the significance of {sup 36 }Cl data to conceptual models of unsaturated zone flow and transport, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) was requested by the Department of Energy (DOE) to design and implement a study to validate the LANL findings. The USGS chose to drill new boreholes at select locations across zones where bomb-pulse ratios had previously been identified. The drill cores were analyzed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) for {sup 36 }Cl/Cl using both active and passive leaches, with the USGS/LLNL concluding that the active leach extracted too much rock-Cl and the passive leach did not show bomb-pulse ratios.

The data were interpreted as an indication that fluids containing 2 ̆ 2 bomb-pulse 2 ̆ 2 36 C 1 reached the repository horizon in the - 50 years since the peak period of above-ground nuclear testing. Moreover, the data support the concept that so-called fast pathways for infiltration not only exist but are active, possibly {{through a combination of}} porous media, faults and/or other geologic features. Due to the significance of 36 C 1 data to conceptual models of unsaturated zone flow and transport, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) was requested by the Department of Energy (DOE) to design and implement a study to validate the LANL findings. The USGS chose to drill new boreholes at select locations across zones where bomb-pulse ratios had previously been identified. The drill cores were analyzed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) for 36 C 1 /C 1 using both active and passive leaches, with the USGS/LLNL concluding that the active leach extracted too much rock-Cl and the passive leach did not show bomb-pulse ratios. Because consensus was not reached between the USGS/LLNL and LANL on several fundamental points, including the conceptual strategy for sampling, interpretation and use of tritium (3 H) data, and the importance and interpretation of blanks, in addition to {{the presence or absence of}} bomb-pulse 36 C 1, an evaluation by an independent entity, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), using new samples was initiated. This report is the result of that study. The overall objectives of the UNLV study were to investigate the source or sources of the conflicting results from the previous validation study, and to obtain additional data to determine whether or not there are bomb-pulse isotopes at the repository horizon. To that end, we have engaged in discussions with previous investigators, reviewed reports, and analyzed archived samples. We have also collected new samples of rock from the ESF, soil profiles from the surface of Yucca Mountain, and opportunistic samples of <b>seep</b> <b>water</b> from inside the south ramp of the ESF. Our sampling strategy in the ESF was to collect new rock samples in a manner that would optimize our chances of finding a 36 C 1 bomb-pulse signature, if one was present. Therefore the sampling and analytical methodology that yielded prior bomb-pulse ratios was replicated (to the extent possible). Specific geologic features (e. g., faults, cooling joints) and strategic locations (including the Ghost Dance, Sundance, Bow Ridge and Drill Hole Wash faults) were targeted. Moreover, extreme precautions were taken to collect samples, excavating a meter into the tunnel wall in some cases. Experiments were performed measuring trace elements and anions in leachates as a function of time to help guide our leaching conditions. Samples were analyzed for 36 C 1 /C 1 ratios, as well as 99 Tc and 129 I, two other radionuclides that can be associated with the bomb-pulse, in select samples. Finally, a column experiment was conducted mimicking the passage of bomb-pulse 36 C 1 through Yucca Mountain tuff (Topopah Spring Tuff middle nonlithophysal unit (Tptpmn)). The work faced several obstacles including an extended shutdown of the tunnel. In addition, some of the data collected early in the study were suspect because of unreasonably high 36 C 1 /C 1 ratios. Attempts to pinpoint the cause of the seemingly random and spurious results were unsuccessful. After moving to a different laboratory in a separate building and employing new supplies, control was gained over the background and blank results were consistent and acceptably small. Because of the setbacks only half (seven) of the ESF samples, but all of the soil and column-study samples, were analyzed in the favorable laboratory setting before the project ended. Overall, the experience highlights the challenging nature of the work and the high sensitivity of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) for 36 C 1...|$|E
40|$|Filters {{are used}} in {{geotechnical}} engineering to control seepage and to prevent erosion of soil due to the drag forces of <b>seeping</b> <b>water.</b> Filters act as barriers to retain the base soil while allowing seepage flows to exit without causing high hydraulic gradients or pore pressures which may damage the structure. This paper describes a new anyalytical model of filtration. The model {{is based on a}} three dimensional network model of filter pores, and the equations of conservatioln of mass and momentum which govern the rate of particle transport. The model has application in the design of granular filters for protecting non-cohesive base soils in embankment dams, retaining walls, drainage wells or road pavements...|$|R
