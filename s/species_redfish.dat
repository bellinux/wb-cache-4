40|$|Morphology-based {{identification}} of North Atlantic Sebastes {{has long been}} controversial and misidentification may produce misleading data, with cascading consequences that negatively affect fisheries management and seafood labelling. North Atlantic Sebastes comprises of four species, commonly known as ‘redfish’, but {{little is known about}} the number, identity and labelling accuracy of <b>redfish</b> <b>species</b> sold across Europe. We used a molecular approach to identify <b>redfish</b> <b>species</b> from ‘blind’ specimens to evaluate the performance of the Barcode of Life (BOLD) and Genbank databases, as well as carrying out a market product accuracy survey from retailers across Europe. The conventional BOLD approach proved ambiguous, and phylogenetic analysis based on mtDNA control region sequences provided a higher resolution for species identification. By sampling market products from four countries, we found the presence of two <b>species</b> of <b>redfish</b> (S. norvegicus and S. mentella) and one unidentified Pacific rockfish marketed in Europe. Furthermore, public databases revealed the existence of inaccurate reference sequences, likely stemming from species misidentification from previous studies, which currently hinders the efficacy of DNA methods for the {{identification of}} Sebastes market samples...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of trawl selectivity studies {{for the three}} <b>redfish</b> <b>species</b> of particular commercial importance in North Atlantic fisheries: Sebastes marinus, Sebastes mentella and Sebastes fasciatus, are based on data collected from diamond mesh codends with mesh sizes ranging from 88 mm to 147 mm. We demonstrate how results from these studies can be understood by morphological characteristics of the species. We predict codend size selection based on morphological data collected from golden redfish (S. marinus) individuals. Further, consistent with previously reported morphological similarities between the three <b>redfish</b> <b>species,</b> we show the predictions for S. marinus may successfully be extrapolated to understand experimental codend size selectivity results reported for S. mentella and S. fasciatus. In addition to the comparison with previously reported data, we present new experimental results for a codend applied in Northeast Atlantic redfish trawl fishery...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} data on {{distribution and}} biology of Sebastes marinus, S. mentella and S. fasciatus from fishing catches on the Flemish Cap in 2005. Biological {{data were collected}} by the observers being aboard Russian fishing vessels in October-November 2005. Fishing was executed at 200 - 400 m depths. Fishing gears were bottom trawls with the mesh size of not less than 130 mm. According to the preliminary dat a, in 2005, on the Flemish Cap, the catch of <b>redfish</b> <b>species</b> by Russian vessels was equal to 1 016 tons. Golden redfish (S. marinus) prevailed (more than 50 %) in catch. The results of bathymetric distribution researches showed that, at 200 - 299 m depths, S. marinus made {{up the bulk of}} catches. With the increase in fishing depth the portion of beaked <b>redfish</b> <b>species</b> (S. mentella and S. fasciatus) which amounted to 95. 6 % at 400 - 499 m depths rose. In according to the results from the trawl surveys by EU, mean long-term biomass of S. marinus equaled to 20 % of the total redfish stock. Increase or decrease in the total stock of <b>redfish</b> <b>species</b> was mainly connect ed with golden redfish stock growth and reduction. At present, on the Flemish Cap the overall stock size is estimated and recommendations for their exploitation are developed based on fishing and biological dat a on two speci es – S. mentella and S. fasciatus.

40|$|Analysis {{of catch}} data from five bottom trawl surveys (1988 - 1992) {{documents}} coincidence between shrimp and important nursery grounds {{for a number}} of fish <b>species,</b> especially <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes spp.), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglos-soides), Atlantic tod (Gadus morhua), and polar tod (Boreogadus suida). The estimated overall combined trawlable shrimp and fish biomasses showed no clear trends between years. However, redfish, Greenland halibut and Atlantic tod showed large fluctuations due to variability in year-class strength. In 1992 the fish catches were identified to 64 taxonomie units (49 species). Boreal fish species occurred most frequently in the hauls {{in the southern part of}} the survey area. There were a decreasing trend in the CPUEs of boreal species from 1988 to 1992.

40|$|Haemoglobins of 225 {{specimens}} of redfish from the Barents Sea and 357 specimens from Icelandic waters were analysed by electrophoresis {{to search for}} genetic differences between the morphologian marinus and mentella types. Two main haemoglobin patterns were commonly found, one characteristic for redfish of the mentella type and one characteristic for the marinus type. Specimens of Sebastes viviparus showed the marinus haemoglobin pattern. Morphological "intermediates" showed the marinus pattern in the Barents Sea while some specimens, which showed the mentella hemoglobin patterns, but could not be separated morphologically from the marinus type, were recorded in the Icelandic-Faeroe Ridge area. Four specimens showed a haemoglobin pattern which indicated hybridization between individuals with different haemoglobin pattern. The results indicate that Sebastes mentella Travin is a species distinct form Sebastes marinus (L), possibly with occasional interbreeding.

40|$|Although urea {{transport}} {{is receiving}} increased attention in mammalian systems, {{very little is}} known about urea transport in fish tissues. This study examined mechanisms of urea transport in red blood cells and hepatocytes from the lesser spotted dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula), Atlantic stingray (Dasyatis sabina), turbot (Scopthalmus maximus), redfish (Scianops ocellatus), gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) and oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau). Urea appeared to be passively distributed in both tissues (i. e. {{there was no difference between}} plasma and tissue urea concentrations). Additionally, a number of in vitro experiments examining [14 C]urea flux were performed. In red blood cells from all <b>species</b> except <b>redfish,</b> urea transport occurred via simple passive diffusion, but redfish red blood cells showed a small (25 %) phloretin-sensitive uptake component. In hepatocytes of the two elasmobranch species (dogfish and stingray), urea efflux was also by simple passive diffusion. However, urea efflux in toadfish (both O. beta and O. tau) hepatocytes exhibited a marked phloretin-sensitivity, and O. beta hepatocytes were used in further experiments with other inhibitors and treatments. Urea transport in O. beta had a relatively high specificity for urea compared with the urea analogues acetamide...|$|R
40|$|Data from 682 {{demersal}} trawls between 126 and 738 m {{were made}} on Flemish Cap in summer during the research surveys in the years 1989 - 1994. Despite {{the fact that the}} depth range for all species was not completely covered, analysis of the vertical distribution of the 25 most representative species showed that the fauna is zoned with depth. Distinct faunal assemblages with characteristic catch rates, diversity, and dominant species are found on the shelf (126 - 300 m), upper continental slope (300 - 600 m) and middle continental slope (> 600 m). Catch rates are greatist on the shelf and upper continental slope, as while as diversity is greatest on the middle continental slope. Dominance of the commercial <b>species</b> (Cod, <b>Redfish,</b> American plaice, Greenland halibut) is an important aspect of the community structure. Diversity patterns may be understood in terms of the relationships with predation, competition, environmental heterogeneity, and trophic level. Also the influence of the fisheries in the area can modify this structure. Only Synaphobranchus kaupy, Urophycis chestery, Gadus morhua, Sebastes mentella, Sebastes marinus and Reinhardtius hippoglossoides showed a significant bigger-deeper relation, while Anarhichas minor and Glyptocephalus cynoglossus has a smaller-deeper relation...|$|R

5000|$|Fly fishing - {{the use of}} {{artificial}} flies as lures. These are cast with specially constructed fly rods and fly lines. The fly line (today, almost always coated with plastic) is heavy enough cast in order to send the fly to the target. Artificial flies vary dramatically in size, weight and colour.

40|$|Two <b>species</b> of <b>redfish</b> of {{commercial}} interest occur off West Greenland inshore and offshore, golden redfish (Sebastes marinus L.) and deep-sea redfish (Sebastes mentella Travin). SSB and recruitment indices for golden redfish decreased drastically from 1982 and have remained significantly below the average level since 1989. Taking {{into account the}} recent very low SSB and the recruitment failure together with the absence of golden redfish in the Greenland surveys, the stock of golden redfish in Subarea 1 {{is considered to be}} severely depleted with no signs of recovery. The deep-sea redfish SSB has been extremely low since 1989. The deep-sea redfish show high variation in recruitment. Good recruitment has been seen in 1997, 2000 and 2001, while the recruitment in 2002 again was very poor. Substantial numbers of redfish are discarded in the shrimp fishery, and concern must be expressed about the continuing failure of the juveniles to rebuild the pre-mature and mature stock components. From Oct. 1 2000, sorting grids have been mandatory in the shrimp fishery and this will hopefully reduce the amount of juvenile redfish in the by-catch significantly. Considering the depleted SSBs, the recruitment potential of the very abundant early life stages at an age of 0 - 2 years to the Subarea 1 stocks remains unclear. 1...|$|R

Many fly anglers catch unintended species such as chub, bream and rudd while fishing for 'main target' species such as trout. A growing population of anglers attempt to catch as many different species as possible with the fly. With the advancement of technology and development of stronger rods and reels, larger predatory saltwater species such as wahoo, tuna, marlin and sharks have become target species on fly. Realistically any fish can be targeted and captured on fly as long as the main food source is effectively replicated by the fly itself and suitable gear is used.|$|R

Microsatellite analyses were used to explore the differences between <b>redfish</b> <b>species</b> from the genus Sebastes and to verify populations structure within S. mentella and S. marinus. This lead to an un equivocal discrimination of the species and an indication of populations structure within those species in the North Atlantic.

Calculations showed that with the change of mesh size from 132 mm to 88 mm in mid-water trawls in the redfish fishery the yield per recruit signi ficantly increased. When using mesh size of 118, 100 and 88 mm instead of 132 mm the largest yield per recruit would rise in 2. 2, 3. 1 and 3. 5 times and concern fish aged 14, 10 and 8 years, respectively. With {{reducing}} mesh size the total yield per recruit increased during the calculation period {{to the age of}} 18 years.

After peaking at an historical high of 79 000 tons in 1987 catches declined to a minimum about 500 tons in 1996, being kept at a low level since then. Catch on {{the last years of}} open fishery (1990 - 1997) and by-catch on the moratorium years (1998 - 2004) are analyzed against recent trends of survey indices. The 1991 - 2004 Canadian spring and autumn surveys are the main source of information used in this work to assess the relative abundance and dynamics of the beaked redfish population on Div. 3 LN. The surveys demonstrate considerable inter-annual variability, the changes frequently being the result of single large catches being taken in different years. Sex ratio and maturity ogives at length were applied to survey abundance at length, for each division and survey series, in order to estimate survey female spawning stock biomass. Instead of looking to the survey indices on a year-to-year basis, trends of the respective mean values were analysed on a broader time scale. The assemblage of Div. 3 L and 3 N survey indices suggests that stock has been increasing from the early 1990 s to the mid- 2000 s in terms of abundance, biomass, and female spawning biomass. However the magnitude of this increase remains difficult to quantify.

Redfish in Div. 3 LN {{is regarded as a}} management unit composed of two Grand Bank populations from those two very similar <b>redfish</b> <b>species.</b> The present ASPIC assessment is based on the logistic form of a non-equilibrium surplus production model (Schaeffer, 1954; Prager, 1994), adjusted to a standardized catch rate series (Power, 1997) and to most of the stratified-random bottom trawl surveys conducted in various years and seasons in Div. 3 L and Div. 3 N from 1978 onwards. Both CPUE and surveys were used with all observations of each series. This assessment is not a follow up of the previous ones (Ávila de Melo et al., 2012 and 2010). The logistic Schaefer production model (1954) incorporated in ASPIC operating model (Prager, 1994) can not cope anymore with the most recent biomass increases observed in both spring and (mainly) autumn Canadian 3 LN surveys, unless it is allowed to provide unrealistic assessment results. And continuing to strip off the highs of each one of these series, {{in order to get a}} picture in line to what is the perception of the stock history from commercial and survey data trends, is no longer a valid option, as reflected on the last STACFIS research recommendation on this matter (NAFO, 2012). Being so, input has been reframed opening room to a new combination of Canadian autumn 3 L and 3 N surveys. The inclusion of the Spanish spring survey on Div. 3 N and the removal of the historical CPUE series have also been considered. Two selected frameworks options have finally run with MSY kept constant at an initial starting guess, instead of being estimated by the model. Before entering the latest (2013) ASPIC Suite flow, the input selected from exploratory analysis was submitted to a sensitivity test in order to evaluate the robustness of the new framework against variability on random number seed, start user guesses for key model parameters and last year survey biomass. The consistency of the new ASPIC assessment with their predecessors was checked by comparison of biomass and fishing mortality fit trajectories against previous ones from the 2012 and 2010 assessments. A 2014 - 2012 retrospective analysis was also performed with good results (small retro bias on relative biomass and fishing 2 mortality in response to the general increase of the still standing survey series), and the assessment pursued successfully to bootstrap mode (again good consistency with previous results) and projections. A medium term management plan is finally proposed, based on bi-annual increases of the catch from the present TAC level of 6 500 t up to target catch/TAC of 18 100 t, the 2014 equilibrium yield from the present assessment, that should be in place by 2019 - 2020.

40|$|A {{combined}} acoustic {{and bottom}} trawl survey to obtain indices of abundance and estimates of length and weight at age {{has been carried}} out each winter (46 weeks in January- March) since 1981 in the Barents Sea. The target species are cod and haddock, but in recent years abundance indices have also been worked out for the <b>redfish</b> <b>species</b> and Greenland halibut. Since 1993 the survey area has been extended to the north and east in order to obtain a more complete coverage of the younger age groups of cod. In winter 1997 only the Norwegian part of the Barents Sea and {{a small part of the}} Svalbard area was covered, while in 1998 also a small part of the Russian EEZ was covered. In 1999 and 2000 the vessels had full access to the Russian EEZ. In 2001 a Russian research vessel covered most of the areas where the Norwegian vessels did not have access, and a sufficient coverage was thus obtained. The main results in 2001 were: - the 1999 year class of cod is very weak and the 2000 year class is indicated to be somewhat below average. The 1998 year class is slightly higher than expected from last years survey; - the abundance indices of 47 year old cod (1997 - 1994 year classes) are around average, as expected from the last years survey; - the numbers of 8 year and older cod are very low; - length and weight at age and weight increment are improving; - the mortality rate has been reduced compared with the previous years for age group 4 and younger, while it is still high for older age groups; - for haddock all the year classes 1998, 1999 and 2000 are indicated to be at or above average. The 1996 year class is below average, but considerably larger than the year classes 1992 - 1995, which are very weak; - length and weight at age and weight increment seem to have stabilized in 2001, after a period of increase over the years 1998 - 2000; - the abundance indices of the <b>redfish</b> <b>species</b> are among the lowest in the time series and there are no signs of improved recruitment; - compared to the 2000 -results the abundance indices of Greenland halibut less than 40 cm have decreased, while they have increased for most of the size groups above 40 cm.

40|$|There are two <b>species</b> of <b>redfish</b> in Divisions 3 L and 3 N, the deep-sea redfish (Sebastes mentella) and the Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus) {{that have}} been commercially fished and {{reported}} collectively as redfish in fishery statistics. Redfish in Div. 3 LN {{is regarded as a}} management unit composed of two Grand Bank populations from those two very similar <b>redfish</b> <b>species.</b> The present ASPIC assessment is based on the logistic form of a non-equilibrium surplus production model (Schaeffer, 1954; Prager, 1994), adjusted to a standardized catch rate series (Power, 1997) and to most of the stratified-random bottom trawl surveys conducted in various years and seasons in Div. 3 L and Div. 3 N from 1978 onwards. These surveys were framed according to the input formulation previously adopted on the 2 nd take of the ASPIC 2008 assessment (Ávila de Melo and Alpoim, 2010 a). The assessment was preceded by an exploratory analysis to check the response of the model to the inclusion of the Spanish spring survey series on Div. 3 N and to the 2010 - 2011 update of the remaining three Canadian survey series that are at present the backbone input of this assessment. Each of these series includes recently high points that are well above their overall increasing trends, observed 2002 onwards. The analysis point out that in terms of consistency with previous assessments and the past history of the redfish fishery, as well as performance of the model, the ASPIC 2012 option with the exclusion of the Spanish survey and the removal of the recent outliers from the respective Canadian series represents the better update of the survey data input framework. The chosen input formulation run afterwards with different last year survey results and different starting guesses for key parameters and different random number seeds, in order to test the robustness of ASPIC results to turbulence in the inputs used to initialize the model deterministic run. A 2012 versus 2010 ASPIC comparative assessment (both on FIT and BOT modes) and a 2012 - 2010 retrospective analysis were also carried out to check the consistency between the two last full assessments and the magnitude of bias on relative biomass and fishing mortality in response to the general increase of the still standing survey series. Regardless the input formulations, the starting guess region, the mode of the ASPIC runs or the retrospective patterns, the 2012 assessment reiterates the main conclusion of the previous ones: the biomass of redfish in Div. 3 LN is above Bmsy, while fishing mortality is well below Fmsy. Most recent catches continue to be at a low level on the historical context of this fishery and the answer of the stock to a direct fishery of the magnitude of years between the mid 1960 ’s and the mid 1980 ’s is unknown. Projections were made on the short term, in order to select a 2013 - 2012 catch roof large enough to consolidate the reopening of a redfish direct fishery on divisions 3 L and 3 N but keeping a high probability of the stock staying above Bmsy. This high probability is defined by the lower 80 % confidence limit of the projected relative biomass trajectory being at or above Bmsy in 2013 - 2015...|$|R
40|$|Combined {{acoustic}} {{and bottom}} trawl survey for cod, haddock and redfish {{were carried out}} in autumn 1988 in the Svalbard area together with an acoustic survey in the Barents Sea. The abundance indicies of cod decreased from 1987 to 1988 both in the Svalbard area and in the Barents Sea where the index has decreased since previous autumn and since last winter. The results for haddock show that the stock is almost not present in the Svalbard area {{and that it has}} decreased in the Barents Sea. The present stock situation of the <b>redfish</b> <b>species</b> Sebastes marinus in this northern part of the species' geographical distribution, show a decreasing trend since 1985 - 1986 slthough the aoustic sruvey give a higher index in 1988 compared to 1987. The abundance indices of S. mentella point to a more stable stock situation for this species after an alarming period of yearly decrease. Both the bottom trawl survey and the acoustic survey in 1988 confirm this. A huge variability in the indices of S. viviparus is probably caused by the fact that this survey only covers a minor part of the speciesæ geographical distribution. The indices are therefore probably not able of showing real trends in this stock. The abundance of Greenland halibut bas increased to the 1985 -level...|$|R
40|$|Since 1991, the {{aggregate}} biomass of fish stocks inhabiting the West Greenland shelf stagnates {{at the lowest}} level. The latest survey results of cruise no. 152 conducted by FRV 'Walther Herwig III' do not indicate any improvements in state of the stocks, although no fishing effort was recently directed towards groundfish. The cod stock showed again a record low and is presently dominated by recruits of the year classes 1991 and 1993. Both year classes {{are considered to be}} weak and the cod stock is beyond the 'minimum biologically acceptable level'. Consequently, an increase in stock abundance is not expected either in short or long term. Other ecologically or economically important fish <b>species,</b> American plaice, <b>redfish,</b> wolffish and starry skate, were also found to have minimum stock abundances. By-catch estimates of juvenile groundfish taken by the shrimp fishery, operating at traditional grounds of cod and redfish fisheries, are indispensible. Analysis of climatological data from Nuuk/West Greenland indicates that climate during the past fourty years was characterized by two decades of anomalous warm conditions, and cooling which dominates the dimate since 1969. Anomalous cold events were encountered during 1983, 1984 and during 1992, 1993. Similar to the air temperature anomalies, autumn temperatures of the ocean surface layer indicate cold and warm periods during the past thirty years. In contrast to the colder than normal atmospheric conditions during the early nineties, however, the ocean conditions indicate intermediate warming...|$|R
40|$|An {{ecosystem}} approach to fisheries (EAF) is {{widely recognized as}} desirable for fisheries management. To progress towards the implementation of an EAF, a {{first step is to}} identify which species co-occur by quantifying assemblage structure in these habitats. A second step is the selection and development of ecological indicators to evaluate and to quantify the ecological state of exploited marine ecosystems. I examined groundfish assemblage structure in relation to depth, in two exploited marine ecosytems, the Southern Grand Banks of Newfoundland and the Flemish Cap, using multivariate analysis. Then I evaluated the status of the two ecosystem using a suit of ecological indicators. Finally, I tested different trajectories at two different depths to examine the population structure of the three <b>species</b> of <b>redfish</b> using Multivariate Autoregressive State Space Models (MARSS). I also included covariates to analyze their effect on population size. I used data obtained from two multispecies bottom trawl surveys performed by the Spanish Administration in the Southern Grand Banks (3 NO survey) from 2002 to 2014, and the European Union (EU) in the Flemish Cap (3 M survey) from 1991 to 2015, in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Regulatory Area (NAFO RA). A total of 1526 hauls were made between 2002 and 2014 in the 3 NO survey, and 3633 hauls between 1991 and 2015 in the 3 M survey. Total catch of the surveys for those periods was 1. 482. 116 kg in 3 NO and 1. 268. 660 in 3 M. Three major main fish assemblages were indentified (38 – 300, 301 – 600, and 601 – 1460 m depth in 3 NO; 129 – 250, 251 – 600, and 601 – 1460 m in 3 M). Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in both areas, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remained similar over time. Indices responded to different exploitation patterns, management, and environmental regimes in each assemblage. MARSS analysis identified separate trajectories for each species in each depth but one overall population growth rate with commercial catch as a covariate. Thus, while biomass trends for each species in each depth showed some temporal independence, all showed the same long-term changes. Thus there was data support to confirm that species could be treated together as a single management unit and to suggest that fishing is an important driver. This study revealed important spatial structure in the fish assemblages in the two fishing grounds and highlights the importance of calculating indicators in each assemblage in order to compare Summary areas and periods under different fishing pressure. This thesis represents a contribution towards the management through a multispecies approach in NAF...|$|R
5000|$|In the North-West Atlantic {{landings}} {{have decreased}} from 4.2 million tons {{in the early}} 1970s to 1.9 million tons in 2013. During the 21th century some species have shown weak signs of recovery, including Greenland halibut, yellowtail flounder, Atlantic halibut, haddock, spiny dogfish, while other stocks shown no such signs, including cod, witch flounder, and redfish. Stocks of invertebrates, in contrast, remain at record levels of abundance. 31% of stocks are overfished in the North-west Atlantic.In 1497 John Cabot became the first to explore mainland North America {{and one of his}} major discoveries was the abundant resources of Atlantic cod off Newfoundland. Referred to as [...] "Newfoundland Currency" [...] this discovery supplied mankind with some 200 million tons of fish over five centuries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit haddock, mackerel, and lobster. From the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of European and Asian distant-water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and number of exploited species. It also expanded the exploited areas from near-shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep-water <b>species</b> such as <b>redfish,</b> Greenland halibut, witch flounder, and grenadiers. Overfishing in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but, because this was occurring on international waters, it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made. In the early 1990s this finally resulted in the collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery. The population of a number of deep-sea fishes also collapsed in the process, including American plaice, redfish, and Greenland halibut, together with flounder and grenadier.|$|R
40|$|The {{combined}} acoustic {{and bottom}} trawl survey in the Barents Sea in winter {{has been carried}} out since 1981. The target species are cod and haddock, but in recent years the <b>redfish</b> <b>species</b> in the area have also been included. In 1989, rock hopper gear was introduced in the bottom trawl survey. This gives considerably higher catchers of the smallest individuals than the bobbins gear. A double set of indices are presented for the bottom trawl survey, one for bobbins gear and one for rock-hopper gear, with indices back-calculated ffrom one gear to the other in the appropriate years. For cod, the acoustic survey gave a total estimate in numbers which was 73 % higher than in 1989, and the bottom trawl survey (rock-hopper gear) a total 16 % higher than in 1989. The corresponding figures for haddock are 85 % and 169 %. The increase is in both surveys largely due to {{increase in the number of}} 1 -group fish. Thus, the 1989 year class of both species appears to be stronger than the 0 -group survey in August-September indicated, and may be of average abundance. Otherwise, the results seem to be in reasonably good agreement with the predictions of stock numbers at age of cod and haddock in the last assessment. For redfish, the bottom trawl indices have not been corrected for the change from bobbins to rock-hopper gear and the effect of the change is not known. The abundance indices from both surveys indicate that the stock situation for Sebastes marinus and Sebastes mentella is stable within the investigated area. The indices for Sebastes viviparus increased in 1990. Indices for the smallest length group are considered unreliable for all three species...|$|R
