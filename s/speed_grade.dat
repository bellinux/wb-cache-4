5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system remains}} unchanged from Ridge Racer, the checkpoint and time limit system remain the same; {{running out of}} time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting is more like Ridge Racer 2. The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission. Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which <b>speed</b> <b>grade</b> is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available {{at the start of the}} game. Ridge Racer Revolution features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racers courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.|$|E

25|$|Although {{this meant}} fewer clock cycles per instruction, {{compared}} to the Z80 for instance, the latter's higher resolution state machine allowed clock frequencies 3-5 times as high without demanding faster memory chips, which was often the limiting factor. This is because the Z80 combines two full (but short) clock cycles into a relatively long memory access period {{compared to the}} clock, while the more asynchronous 6809 instead has relatively short memory access times: depending on version and <b>speed</b> <b>grade,</b> approximately 60% of a single clock cycle was typically available for memory access in a 6809 (see data sheets).|$|E

The memory bus connects the northbridge and RAM, just as the front-side bus connects the CPU and northbridge. Often, these two buses must operate at the same frequency. Increasing the front-side bus to 450 MHz in most cases also means running the memory at 450 MHz.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the accuracy of using <b>speed</b> and <b>grade</b> data obtained from a low-cost global positioning system (GPS) receiver to estimate metabolic rate (MR) during level and uphill outdoor walking. Thirty young, healthy adults performed randomized outdoor walking for 6 -min periods at 2. 0, 3. 5, and 5. 0 km/h and on three different grades: 1) level walking, 2) uphill walking on a 3. 7 % mean grade, and 3) uphill walking on a 10. 8 % mean grade. The reference MR [metabolic equivalents (METs) and oxygen uptake (V? O 2) ] values were obtained using a portable metabolic system. The <b>speed</b> and <b>grade</b> were obtained using a low-cost GPS receiver (1 -Hz recording). The GPS grade (altitude/distance walked) was calculated using both uncorrected GPS altitude data and GPS altitude data corrected with map projection software. The accuracy of predictions using reference <b>speed</b> and <b>grade</b> (actual[SPEED/GRADE]) data was high [R 2 0. 85, root-mean-square error (RMSE) 0. 68 MET]. The accuracy decreased when GPS <b>speed</b> and uncorrected <b>grade</b> (GPS[UNCORRECTED]) data were used, although it remained substantial (R 2 0. 66, RMSE 1. 00 MET). The accuracy was greatly improved when the GPS <b>speed</b> and corrected <b>grade</b> (GPS[CORRECTED]) data were used (R 2 0. 82, RMSE 0. 79 MET). Published predictive equations for walking MR were also cross-validated using actual or GPS <b>speed</b> and <b>grade</b> data when appropriate. The prediction accuracy was very close when either actual[SPEED/GRADE] values or GPS[CORRECTED] values (for level and uphill combined) or GPS speed values (for level walking only) were used. These results offer promising research and clinical applications related to the assessment of energy expenditure during free-living walking. Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society...|$|R

50|$|A 1.13 GHz {{version was}} {{released}} in mid-2000 but famously recalled after a collaboration between HardOCP and Tom's Hardware discovered various instabilities with {{the operation of the}} new CPU <b>speed</b> <b>grade.</b> The Coppermine core was unable to reliably reach the 1.13 GHz speed without various tweaks to the processor's microcode, effective cooling, additional voltage (1.75 V vs. 1.65 V), and specifically validated platforms. Intel only officially supported the processor on its own VC820 i820-based motherboard, but even this motherboard displayed instability in the independent tests of the hardware review sites. In benchmarks that were stable, performance was shown to be sub-par, with the 1.13 GHz CPU equalling a 1.0 GHz model. Tom's Hardware attributed this performance deficit to relaxed tuning of the CPU and motherboard to improve stability. Intel needed at least six months to resolve the problems using a new cD0 stepping and re-released 1.1 GHz and 1.13 GHz versions in 2001.|$|E
