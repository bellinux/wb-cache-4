40|$|The {{main purpose}} of diploma thesis - Consumers {{protection}} {{during the process of}} contracting - was to analyze the consumer protection legislation at national level and European level. Thesis deals with consumers protection during the process of contracting in Czech Republic with closer focus on <b>distance</b> <b>contracts</b> and off-premises contracts. The general part of thesis provides a comprehensive insight into the private, public and European regulation of consumer law, as well as it summarizes basic concepts and consumer contracts more in detail. Two chapters of the general part are devoted to the <b>distance</b> <b>contracts</b> and to the off-premises contracts. Analytical part of thesis is based on quantitative research made by me. These results are compared with the results of two European surveys (Eurobarometers). The aim of the research was to define the attitude of Czech consumers to the consumer law, protection of the consumer rights and also find out more about their approach within the <b>distance</b> <b>contracts...</b>|$|R
40|$|Consumer law is {{harmonised}} at European Union level, however, {{even though}} there are still differences in the legislation of individual states. The aim of this thesis is to describe and compare the Czech and Spanish legislation relating to consumer <b>distance</b> <b>contracts</b> and contracts concluded away from business premises. The thesis is divided into four chapters that firstly analyse the issue in both countries separately, and then provide a partial comparison. The thesis deals with an overview of the sources of consumer law, consumer policy institutions and organisations, definitions of basic concepts relating to consumer contracts, the general rules relating to all consumer contracts and at the conclusion with specific conditions that must be followed when concluding <b>distance</b> <b>contracts</b> and contracts away from business premises...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to compare common methods of public {{property}} sales in the Czech Republic - it compares <b>sales</b> <b>through</b> public auction with sealed-bid auction. Public auctions with more regulated publicity standards show much lower rate of failed auction, which might make them preferable method of sale. Revenue of both methods {{is found to be}} similar, which fits the auction theory predictions, despite demonstrated bias in official price estimates and institutional frictions. The difference between the methods is reflected {{in the fact that the}} revenues from the <b>sales</b> <b>through</b> sealed-bid auctions have lower variance than the <b>sales</b> <b>through</b> public auctions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the legislation, doctrinal {{opinions}} and relevant case law regarding the consumer's right of withdrawal from contracts concluded by electronic means (e-contracts). The objectives pursued by the author are:- establishing the juridical nature of consumer's right of withdrawal from e-contracts;- identification of problems that could arise from law’s interpretation,- issuing of the de lege ferenda proposals. Governmental Ordinance no. 130 / 2000 introduces a new exception to the principle of irrevocability of contracts in Romanian law: the consumer's right of withdrawal from <b>distance</b> <b>contracts.</b> The same Ordinance sets the scope and conditions for the applicability of this right. Consumer's right of withdrawal from e-contracts, as a type of <b>distance</b> <b>contracts,</b> can be exercised without the need to give any specific reason and without penalties, within 10 working days from the date of receiving the goods or from the another moment depending on the specifics set out in GO no. 130 / 2000. If consumer cancels the <b>distance</b> <b>contract</b> on the basis that he does not like the goods, the withdrawal from the contract is valid, even if the withdrawal solely depended on the will of the consumer, this sets out a legal exception from the provisions of art. 1010 of Civil Code which stipulate the nullity of the obligations undertook by the liable person under the condition “if I want”. Sales of goods by electronic means, as a particular case of a <b>distance</b> <b>contracts,</b> is, therefore, a new form of selling, governed by its own specific legal regime...|$|R

50|$|Customers usually joined record clubs {{by agreeing}} to buy {{a certain number of}} records, but a {{significant}} number of members would not pay for records they ordered. Record companies saw lower royalties from <b>sales</b> <b>through</b> record clubs than from <b>sales</b> <b>through</b> stores and other means. Also, the clubs could give away up to one free record for every record sold--resulting in about half as much revenue for record companies as they might get through other kinds of distributors.|$|R
40|$|With the {{expansion}} of global communication the commercial world has changed its proceedings. The Internet has {{played a crucial role}} in the development of new ways of doing business, by creating a major global market. E-commerce is one of the main subjects discussed in legal environments last years. The need to develop legal elaboration with the same pace as the technology innovation brought a legal revolution in electronic commerce. In Albania the elements of this revolution switched sides: the legal regulation came before the practical usage. The Albanian legislation has responded to this inclination by creating a complete legal framework regarding electronic commerce. One of the most important legal aspects of the electronic revolution is the development of <b>distance</b> <b>contracts.</b> <b>Distance</b> <b>contracts</b> have the same legal validity as the traditional paper contracts, but as we will show the implementation in practice of this principle is by all means more complicated. Information technology is becoming one of the most influencing factors in the global economy structure, so its development will inevitably help Albania in having a smoother transition. In this paper after a theoretical discussion of <b>distance</b> <b>contracts</b> and their legal validity we aim to investigate the way in which information technology regarding electronic documents and especially electronic signature, influences the development of new ways of contracting, with a special focus regarding the increase of public trust in these innovations...|$|R
