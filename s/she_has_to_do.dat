5|$|Lane advises Joan {{to demand}} a 5% {{partnership}} stake in the company, adding that, when {{he thought he was}} essential {{to the future of the}} firm, he settled for much less than he felt was due him. Joan later tells Pete she wants a partnership, comprising 5% of the business and voting rights, in exchange for her spending the night with Herb. Pete asks how to make the arrangements, to which she icily and rhetorically asks if <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it all. Pete later tells Don about the arrangement with Joan. Don visits Joan's apartment to dissuade her. She thanks him and wishes him luck on the presentation, but it is eventually revealed that, unbeknownst to Don, her sexual encounter with Herb had already taken place.|$|E
5|$|Snow and the Huntsman walk {{together}} in the forest, and she sees through his disguise and correctly guesses that he was sent by the Queen to kill her. Snow flees, but as the Huntsman catches up with her, he finds her writing a letter, which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed. The Huntsman takes out his knife, but instead of killing her, he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick, telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run. The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart, hoping that she will not know the difference. The queen asks him to read her the letter, which is an apology for past wrongs {{as well as a}} request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion. The queen burns the letter and takes the box with the heart in it to store in her vault. When she cannot open one of her storage safes, it proves that the Huntsman lied to her; the heart is not human. The Queen has her guards drag him down to the vault and she yanks his glowing heart out of his body. She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet and will do her bidding forever, and if he ever betrays her, all <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is squeeze.|$|E
500|$|Outside the school, Winn and a {{group of}} Bajorans protest Keiko's {{teaching}} methods. Winn offers Keiko a solution—all <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is simply stop teaching about the wormhole. When Keiko refuses to accept Winn's proposal, Winn leads the Bajoran parents to take their children out of school. Sisko visits Vedek Bareil (Philip Anglim) for advice on the problem. [...] Bareil opposes Winn's views but he cannot support Sisko as he is attempting to become the next Kai, the leader of the Bajoran religion. Sisko returns to DS9 and asks for help from Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor), but she also refuses to help. Meanwhile, Odo (René Auberjonois) and Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) finish investigating the remains of the Starfleet ensign Miles and Neela found earlier. [...] They discover that the ensign had been murdered by a phaser when he became aware of someone tampering with the Runabout security controls.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) informs Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) {{that her}} {{unlicensed}} Janis Joplin biopic {{is hard to}} sell due to test audiences not liking it. They decide to up the PR {{by going to the}} Kids Choice Awards where Jenna discovers that she is dead. She is accidentally put in the memorial montage at the show, which Jack decides to use as an advantage for the film. He tells her that all <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is stay {{out of the public eye}} until he sells the movie. At the same time, all employees from the 30 Rock building need to disclose any inter-office relationships. NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) discloses that he fantasizes about marrying a TGS dancer, named Daphne (Danielle Flora), but discovers that [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown) is dating her. A minor conflict ensues between them, but ends when Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) decides to mediate this. As a result, Tracy fires Daphne, but this backfires when the other dancers refuse to work. This prompts Tracy to solve this problem by hiring new dancers.|$|E
500|$|Rita (Laura Elena Harring) is {{the mysterious}} and {{helpless}} apparent victim, a classic femme fatale with her dark, strikingly beautiful appearance. Roger Ebert {{was so impressed}} with Harring that he said of her [...] "all <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is stand there and she is the first good argument in 55years for a Gilda remake". She serves as the object of desire, directly oppositional to Betty's bright self-assuredness. She is also the first character with whom the audience identifies, and as viewers know her only as confused and frightened, not knowing who she is and where she is going, she represents their desire {{to make sense of the}} film through her identity. Instead of threatening, she inspires Betty to nurture, console and help her. Her amnesia makes her a blank persona, which one reviewer notes is [...] "the vacancy that comes with extraordinary beauty and the onlooker's willingness to project any combination of angelic and devilish onto her". A character analysis of Rita asserts that her actions are the most genuine of the first portion of the film, since she has no memory and nothing to use as a frame of reference for how to behave. Todd McGowan, however, author of a book on themes in Lynch's films, states that the first portion of Mulholland Drive can be construed as Rita's fantasy, until Diane Selwyn is revealed; Betty is the object that overcomes Rita's anxiety about her loss of identity. According to film historian Steven Dillon, Diane transitions a former roommate into Rita: following a tense scene where the roommate collects her remaining belongings, Rita appears in the apartment, smiling at Diane.|$|E
500|$|A pun, the character's name [...] "Kim Possible" [...] {{alludes to}} the word [...] "impossible". Kim is {{referred}} to by several nicknames by various characters throughout the series, including K.P. (Ron); Kimmy Cub (James); K, Miss Perfect, Tin Teeth (Bonnie); Princess, Pumpkin, Cupcake, Miss Snooty, Miss Priss (Shego); and Kimmie by miscellaneous. Unlike traditional superheroes and secret agents, Kim lacks a secret identity; the character is known simply as [...] "Kim Possible, and everyone who knows her knows what she does." [...] Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle observed that Kim [...] "never put on spandex or acquired a secret identity; instead, {{she had her own}} website where people could book her for jobs with a tagline that promised that she could do anything", a claim reinforced by {{the fact that she is}} capable of fighting crime while continuing to perform well in high school and remaining captain of her school's cheerleading squad. Writing for Women Write About Comics, Jamie Kingston observed that Middleton High School [...] "ignores her as a heroine unless something happens on school grounds where <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> her thing." [...] Thus, Kim rarely receives attention for her work from her family and peers, although her customers remain grateful. However, while describing Kim as a [...] "power fantasy", Stealing Commas believes that Kim is simply [...] "preventing regime change" [...] and [...] "Preserving the status quo rather than doing any real world saving." [...] According to Metacritic, Kim [...] "is stubborn, strong-willed, and has a fuse shorter than a grenade with a three second delay" [...] but remains [...] "extremely humble, refusing to take credit for her truly amazing actions." [...] Meanwhile, David Horiuchi of Amazon.com wrote that the character is [...] "tough, witty, and refreshingly free of any saucy teen attitude." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anna Walton as Princess Nuala: King Balor's {{daughter}} and Nuada's twin sister. She {{is described as}} [...] "very light" [...] while Nuada is [...] "very dark", creating a yin and yang dynamic. She elaborated on the incestuous tones between her character and Prince Nuada, [...] "He's the dark side and she's the light side and they're pulled apart and pulled back together again, and she's {{trying to get away}} because she knows there is something <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He can't let that go and they can't really do anything without each other so it's a really interesting thing." [...] Her character also forms a relationship with Abe Sapien, and Walton noted their similarities, [...] "They are both slightly lost souls and they understand each other." [...] Walton spoke of her character's sense of purpose, [...] "She feels very strongly about what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the film, and then her absolute connection and love for the Earth and what we are given. That's what she's here to protect... Her relationship with her brother, and how he is almost a part of her but she has to break away and will {{do whatever it takes to}} stop him from achieving what he wants to achieve, which is the mass destruction of mankind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. What we {{want for}} Salome is {{sweetness}} and delicacy and refinement; for <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> rather a bold thing, and yet keep herself a lady." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Quite {{disgusted with}} her, papa,' said Fanny. 'I really don't see what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with my marriage. Let her keep {{to her own}} matrimonial projects--if she has any.' ...|$|E

50|$|Terry <b>had</b> <b>to</b> drop {{a couple}} of pounds {{in the last couple}} of hours to make her desired weight class, which has taken a toll on her. If she can come in at 118 lb, she can compete as a {{lightweight}} and put her up against women her size. If she comes in at over 118 lb, she will compete as a middle weight, which is not her desired weight class. She never said what she <b>did</b> in order <b>to</b> get down to her preferred weight, but said <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "At {{nine years}} old <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the {{housework}} and be a mother to the other two, besides going to school. This is all because Lady Malloring has conscientious scruples about marriage with a deceased wife's sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} think," [...] almost whispered Marian, [...] "that {{it is not}} he, poor boy, {{whose eyes}} are {{the worst in the}} house; but Mrs. Lyddell's head has been so full of Johnny, and Caroline, and all <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> that she will not see anything amiss with Lionel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it?" [...] said Cornelia, not so {{much with}} preoccupation, perhaps, as with indifference. She thought it rather a nice name, {{but she did not}} know what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it.|$|R
60|$|She laughed again. I {{wanted her}} to go on talking, because her laugh was so delightful. But we had reached the road, {{and she said she}} must go back: there were so many things <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
60|$|All <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{at present}} was {{to listen to}} Miss Bracy, who was sure that Mrs. Rivers thought Mary and Blanche were not improved, and was afraid she was ungrateful for all the {{intended}} kindness to her sister.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said he, [...] "if that estimable {{young woman}} wants {{to catch a}} sight of them, all <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to step along lively, for at this present moment she is walking over the field-path {{straight}} to this house, and what is more, she is wearing her bonnet and carrying a parasol." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better, but {{not out of}} her room. It {{has been}} a {{tolerable}} state of things of late.

Do you know about all that, Marian?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mrs. Doctor, dear, it does NOT {{seem to me}} fair. Here is me, {{who never}} said a word against the men, and I cannot get married nohow. And there is Cornelia Bryant, who is never done abusing them, and all <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to reach out her hand and pick one up, as it were. It is a very strange world, Mrs. Doctor, dear." ...|$|E
60|$|Could she {{with her}} hands fight {{the face of the}} earth, beat the hills in their places? Yet her breast wanted to fight, to fight the whole world. And these two small hands were all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it with.|$|R

6000|$|She did {{not answer}} for a few moments. She became {{interested}} in the flame of the little spirit lamp that kept her coffee hot. She finished what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with that and then remarked, [...] "I thought you two were not to correspond." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You want to heap up facts, Lombroso fashion? Well, {{this is as}} good as most of Lombroso's facts, or better. I went up one morning, last winter, to work at a {{study of}} a Madonna from Marion, {{directly}} after breakfast, and left her below in the dining-room, putting away the breakfast things. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that occasionally, between the local helps, who are all we can get in the winter. She professes to like it, but you never can tell, from what a woman says; <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, anyway." [...] It is hard to convey a notion of the serene, impersonal acquiescence of Mrs. Alderling in taking this talk of her. [...] "I was banging away at it when I knew she was behind me looking over my shoulder rather more stormily than she usually does; usually, she is a dead calm. I glanced up, and saw the calm succeed the storm. I kept on, and after awhile I was aware of hearing her step on the stairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's very proper," [...] said my grandmother, {{speaking}} {{a little more}} briskly.
