5|$|A popular myth is that {{sharks are}} immune to disease and cancer, {{but this is}} not scientifically supported. Sharks have been known to get cancer. Both {{diseases}} and parasites affect sharks. The evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been few, if any, scientific or statistical <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> show sharks to have heightened immunity to disease.|$|E
5|$|A review makes {{reference}} {{to a number of}} <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> show the involvement of the hippocampus in conflict tasks. The authors suggest that a challenge is to understand how conflict processing relates to the functions of spatial navigation and memory and how all of these functions need not be mutually exclusive.|$|E

5|$|According to the USDA, in 2016 501,560 animals (61%) (not {{including}} rats, mice, birds, or invertebrates) {{were used}} in procedures that did not include more than momentary pain or distress. 247,882 (31%) animals {{were used in}} procedures in which pain or distress was relieved by anesthesia, while 71,370 (9%) were used in <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> would cause pain or distress {{that would not be}} relieved.|$|E
5|$|After his death, Gasparo's {{reputation}} {{fell into}} oblivion caused by unfavourable secular criticism. His complex artistic personality and catalog of works were only reconstructed {{from the end}} of the twentieth century, thanks to targeted critical <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> have for the first time allowed a thorough analysis and rediscovery of his works.|$|E
5|$|Although Sri Lankan Tamils are {{culturally}} and linguistically distinct, genetic {{studies indicate that}} they {{are closely related to}} other ethnic groups in the island while being related to the Indian Tamils from South India as well. There are various <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> indicate varying degrees of connections between Sri Lankan Tamils, Sinhalese and Indian ethnic groups.|$|E

5|$|During {{the years}} of World War II, {{evacuated}} and orphaned children were the subjects of <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> outlined their reactions to separation, including the ability to cope by forming relationships with other children. Some of this material remained unpublished until the post-war period and only gradually contributed to understanding of young children's reactions to loss.|$|E
5|$|Focusing on color terminology, with easily {{discernible}} {{differences between}} perception and vocabulary, Brown and Lenneberg published in 1954 {{a study of}} Zuni color terms that slightly support a weak effect of semantic categorization of color terms on color perception. In doing so they began a line of empirical <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> investigated the principle of linguistic relativity.|$|E
5|$|However, {{mitochondrial}} DNA reflects {{only the}} history of the females in a population and so may not represent {{the history of}} the population as a whole. This can be partially overcome by the use of paternal genetic sequences, such as the non-recombining region of the Y-chromosome. In a broader sense, only <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> also include nuclear DNA can provide a comprehensive evolutionary history of a population.|$|E

50|$|Wiebe's {{research}} covers {{topics such}} as risk factors for injury, alcohol use, {{and the effect of}} daily routines on health behaviors. In 2003, he published a <b>study</b> <b>that</b> concluded that having a gun in the home increased the risk of homicide and suicide. The same <b>study</b> concluded <b>that</b> 41% of gun homicides and 94% of gun suicides would not happen without access to guns. In 2009, he co-authored a <b>study</b> <b>that</b> found that gun owners {{were more likely to be}} shot in an assault than were non-gun owners, which has been credited with persuading the United States Congress to extend the Dickey Amendment to include the National Institutes of Health (which funded the study) two years later. In 2015, he co-authored another <b>study</b> <b>that</b> found that someone's location and how they got there both affected their risk of violent victimization.|$|R
5|$|However, {{since this}} initial skepticism, {{biologists}} {{have come to}} a consensus that declines in amphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity. This consensus emerged with {{an increase in the number}} of <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> monitored amphibian populations, direct observation of mass mortality in pristine sites that lacked apparent cause, and an awareness that declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature.|$|E
5|$|Since {{this report}} was released, several {{independent}} reviews {{have examined the}} body of published research for a possible thiomersal-autism link by examining the theoretical mechanisms of thiomersal causing harm and by reviewing the in vitro, animal, and population <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> have been published. These reviews determined that no significant evidence exists to establish thiomersal {{as the cause of}} autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.|$|E
5|$|<b>Studies</b> <b>that</b> {{have focused}} on {{inheritance}} patterns rather than on specific genes have found that 80% of the offspring of two obese parents were also obese, in contrast to less than 10% of the offspring of two parents who were of normal weight. Different people exposed to the same environment have different risks of obesity due to their underlying genetics.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, Suzanne Bergeron, for example, raises {{examples}} of <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> illustrate the multifaceted effects of globalization on women, including Kumudhini Rosa's study of Sri Lankan, Malaysian, and Philippine, workers in free trade zones {{as an example}} of local resistance to globalization. Women there use their wages to create women's centers aimed at providing legal and medical services, libraries and cooperative housing, to local community members. Such efforts, Bergeron highlights, allow women the chance to take control of economic conditions, increase their sense of individualism, and alter the pace and direction of globalization itself.|$|E
