The 1865 'Red Flag Act' reduced the speed limit to 4 mph in the country and 2 mph in towns and required a man with a red flag or lantern to walk 60 yd ahead of each vehicle, and warn horse riders and horse drawn traffic of the approach of a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>machine.</b> The 1878 Act removed the need for the flag and reduced the distance of the escort to 20 yd.|$|E

50|$|Other {{machines}} were also introduced during this period. The first feller buncher {{was used by}} the Quebec North Shore Paper Company in 1957.

In 1948 several Bombardier {{machines were}} employed to this end by the Ste. Anne Power Company Limited in Quebec. In 1959 Timberland Machines of Woodstock, Ontario developed the Timberbuncher, a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>machine</b> which could move through the forest, cut a whole tree at its base (a process known as full tree harvesting) and, using a hydraulic arm, place it into a pile for hauling.

Today's largest machines have engines producing up to Krone, are fitted with headers able to cut up to a 35 ft swath of corn in a single pass, and an output exceeding 400 tons of silage per hour (Krone). Silage made from grass, canola, oats or wheat are chopped in pieces 5 to 76 millimeters (depending on knife, cutterhead, and length of cut transmission configuration) and treated with additives including bacteria, enzymes, mold inhibitors, and preservatives to accelerate the fermentation process. When silage is made of corn or sorghum additives are not necessary because of the high sugar and starch levels in the plants. Additives however are frequently added to corn and sorghum to augment their fermentation.|$|E

An observational intervention study among 10 floor layers {{was performed to}} assess the differences between a self-propelled and a manually moved machine.

Compared to the <b>self-propelled</b> <b>machine,</b> the duration of kneeling (∆ 13 min; p = 0. 003) and trunk flexion (∆ 12 min; p < 0. 001) was shorter using the manually moved machine, and the duration of pushing and pulling increased (∆ 39 min; p < 0. 001). No significant or relevant differences were found for production time, perceived load and discomfort. Nine out of ten floor layers found the manually moved machine applicable and three out of ten found the <b>self-propelled</b> <b>machine</b> applicable. When compared with the traditional manner of floor laying, both electrical machines reduced the exposure towards kneeling and trunk flexion.

40|$|During {{last years}} public concern about {{environmental}} pollution due to pesticides is growing and, among other consequences, this situation boosted research on physical weed control methods {{as an alternative}} to herbicides. In the recent past researches have been carried out about the feasibility of the use of water steam, as a replacement of chemical weeding in particular conditions where no chemical residues are allowed, e. g. in organic farming. Tests carried out with a steam jet directly on the weeds confirmed its effectiveness in killing weeds, but also showed high energy requirements and very low working speed, despite the high thermal contents of steam. To improve weed control efficiency, a chamber where the steam can condense on the surfaces of the plants was developed, in order to exploit the high efficiency of latent heat transfer of condensing water steam, as suggested by a theoretical analysis. Preliminary lab test confirmed the validity of this approach, showing a higher energy efficiency in respect to the direct application. Following these encouraging results a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>machine</b> was equipped with a condensation chamber specifically designed to perform field tests on 5 species (two dicots and three grasses), to be treated at two different growth stages.

One of the purposes for using such systems in a copper ore underground mine is to assess the performance of <b>self-propelled</b> <b>machines,</b> e. g. loaders. The effectiveness of the loader operation might be estimated by taking into account different sources of information and evaluation criteria. This paper presents a method for the identification of a loader operation regime: loading, haulage and unloading of ore. It is expected that such a cycle should be repeated during a single shift. The proposed algorithm is based on the measurements of the hydraulic pressure acquired on the bucket's hydraulic cylinder. This signal is very noisy, thus further analysisrequires it's smoothing. We propose to incorporate the Kalman filter in order to smooth the signal. Kalman filtering is commonly used in optimal filtering of nonstationary signals. Further steps of the proposed algorithm indicate moments of basic loader's routines. Finally, the information about the number and duration of loading and unloading cycles is provided. The algorithm is illustrated by an analysis of real data from the monitoring system that describes the pressure measured on the bucket's hydraulic cylinder during the entire 6 -hour-long shift...|$|R
