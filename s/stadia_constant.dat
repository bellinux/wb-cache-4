5000|$|The stadia marks are set a {{specific}} distance apart. The distance is chosen {{so that there}} is a fixed, integer ratio between the distance observed between the marks and the distance from the telescope to the measuring device observed. This is known as the <b>stadia</b> <b>constant</b> or stadia interval factor. For example, a typical stadia mark pair are set so that the ratio is 100. If one observes a stadia rod, rule or levelling rod with the telescope and sees that the rod spans 0.5m between the marks (the stadia interval), then the distance from the instrument to the rod is: ...|$|E
