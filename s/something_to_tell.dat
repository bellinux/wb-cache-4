25|$|Bennet becomes {{frustrated}} after Isaac {{is unable}} to paint something that makes sense to him. When Eden protests his actions, Bennet shows her a series of photographs depicting Sylar's dead victims—all with their brains removed from their heads—and says {{he is determined to}} save his daughter from such a fate. He orders Eden to go to the homecoming game and look for Sylar and grounds Claire to prevent her from being killed. Bennet discovers later, however, that Claire snuck out and worriedly runs to the school to find her. When he arrives, he is too late to stop Sylar from attacking the cheerleader in the pictures. Bennet soon discovers that the victim was not Claire; rather, it was Jackie Wilcox, one of Claire's fellow cheerleaders. A relatively relieved Bennet soon reunites with his daughter and insists they go home while the police handle things. Claire says that she has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her father regarding her uncanny survival.|$|E

500|$|Contrecœur {{prepared}} {{an official}} {{report of the}} action {{that was based on}} two sources. [...] Most of it came from a Canadien named Monceau who escaped the action but apparently did not witness Jumonville's slaying: [...] " [...] saw themselves surrounded by the English {{on one side and the}} Indians on the Other. [...] The English gave them two volleys, but the Indians did not fire. [...] Mr. de Jumonville, by his interpreter, told them to desist, that he had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them. [...] Upon which they ceased firing. [...] Then Mr. de Jumonville ordered the Summons which I had sent them to retire, to be read ... Monceau saw all our Frenchmen coming up close to Mr. de Jumonville, whilst they were reading the Summons ... during which Time, said Monceau made the best of his Way to us". [...] Contrecœur's second source was an Indian from Tanacharison's camp, who reported that [...] "Mr. de Jumonville was killed by a Musket-Shot in the Head, whilst they were reading the Summons". The same Indian claimed that the Indians then rushed in to prevent the British from slaughtering the Frenchmen.|$|E
