The freeze on U.S. economic aid, the suspension of the Commercial Import Program and various capital works initiatives were lifted. The United States quickly moved to recognise Thơ and Minh.|$|E
25|$|USC {{was forced}} to vacate their BCS title win, along with their regular-season victory over rival UCLA, due to NCAA <b>sanctions</b> <b>that</b> stemmed from the USC {{athletics}} scandal. The AP title was not vacated, as the AP does not punish teams for violations. The severity of these sanctions has since been criticized by some pundits across college football.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1960 the Indiana Hoosiers {{football}} program was hit with devastating NCAA <b>sanctions</b> <b>that</b> impacted every varsity sport at the school, including basketball. Although the violations only occurred within the football program, all Hoosier varsity sports were barred from postseason play during the probationary period. The sanctions drastically undermined the ability of coaches to lure talented players to Indiana. Nevertheless, McCracken did manage to successfully recruit twins Dick Van Arsdale and Tom Van Arsdale, both of whom would earn All-America honors in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Although Singapore {{law does}} not set out the <b>sanctions</b> <b>that</b> may be imposed for {{contempt}} of court, it is accepted that the courts may impose reasonable fines and imprisonment. To decide what punishment is appropriate, the culpability of the offender and the likely interference with the administration of justice are considered. The only defence available to the offence of scandalizing the court is {{to prove that the}} allegedly contemptuous act or statement amounts to fair criticism, which involves showing that the criticism was made respectfully and in good faith.|$|E
25|$|The {{historians who}} relay such stories, principally Tacitus and Suetonius, wrote some 70 {{years after the}} events in an {{environment}} hostile to the imperial line to which Messalina had belonged. Suetonius' history is largely scandal-mongering. Tacitus claims to be transmitting 'what was heard and written by my elders' without naming sources other than the memoirs of Agrippina the Younger, who had arranged to displace Messalina's children in the imperial succession and was therefore particularly interested in blackening her predecessor's name. It {{has been argued that}} what passes for history is largely a result of the political <b>sanctions</b> <b>that</b> followed her death.|$|E

25|$|The UFW during Chavez's tenure was {{committed}} to restricting immigration. Chavez and Dolores Huerta, cofounder {{and president of the}} UFW, fought the Bracero Program that existed from 1942 to 1964. Their opposition stemmed from their belief that the program undermined U.S. workers and exploited the migrant workers. Since the Bracero Program ensured a constant supply of cheap immigrant labor for growers, immigrants could not protest any infringement of their rights, lest they be fired and replaced. Their efforts contributed to Congress ending the Bracero Program in 1964.

The girl was turned over to her adoptive parents on the evening of September 23, 2013. On September 25, 2013, the Charleston County Family Court began contempt proceedings against Brown and the Cherokee Nation for withholding Veronica {{in the face of the}} South Carolina adoption decree, which was finalized in July. Both parties may face financial <b>sanctions</b> <b>that</b> could include defraying living and legal expenses for the Capobiancos during the period that Brown and the Cherokee Nation were allegedly in contempt of court.
