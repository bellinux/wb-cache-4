40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{reviews the}} debates on environmentally sustainable and <b>socially</b> <b>inclusive</b> <b>growth</b> with specific focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. It observes that, even considering its inherent limits, the discourse on growth is still imprisoned by the Washington Consensus mode of thinking. There have been attempts by various institutions and commissions appointed by heads {{of government to}} take the debate forward, but a lack of commonly agreed global norms undermines prospects for shifts in thinking. Nonetheless, countries need to undertake such efforts {{if there is to}} be any meaningful deliberation on environmentally sustainable and <b>socially</b> <b>inclusive</b> <b>growth.</b> In this regard, the paper also examines the strengths and weaknesses of efforts undertaken by South Africa thus far. Policy emphases on the role of the state and structural transformation that predominate in debates in formal institutions in the African continent are insufficient.

40|$|With {{more than}} 50 {{percent of the}} European {{population}} (EU- 24) living in rural areas and a renewed focus on stimulating smart, sustainable and <b>socially</b> <b>inclusive</b> <b>growth,</b> Rural Development Programmes (RDPs) are an important instrument for economic, social and environmental policies. Evaluating the impact of rural development programmes is, however, complicated due to the widely varying policy targets of RDPs {{as well as their}} substantial heterogeneity across rural areas. In this paper we use spatial econometric techniques to evaluate RDPs in the European Union, at the NUTS 2 level, and focus specifically on labour productivity in the agricultural sector. To address the clear spatial patterns in the distribution of agricultural labour productivity, we employ regression models in which spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence are explicitly modelled to quantify the impact of RDPs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} work-lives of middle class Muslim {{professionals}} in India's new service economy. While these workers have successfully negotiated labour market {{entry into the}} ‘core’ growth sectors of India's globalising economy, they are simultaneously subject to different forms of social, cultural and political marginalisation. Strikingly, they also remain {{at the margins of}} both economic geography and development geography scholarship. The paper extends a growing development geography/economic geography ‘intellectual trading zone’ and enhances understandings of the complex relationships between labour agency, marginality and social inclusion. The paper draws on new survey data to document patterns of labour agency amongst Muslim professionals in New Delhi. This is augmented by interviews with Muslim professionals to show how different forms of marginality are experienced in their everyday work-lives and the strategies and agencies articulated towards (re) working those marginalities. The paper concludes by reflecting on the broader implications of these findings in relation to <b>socially</b> <b>inclusive</b> <b>growth,</b> the middle-class transformation of India's Muslims and wider understandings of marginality and worker agency...|$|E

40|$|A key {{aspect of}} the United Nations’ {{sustainable}} development approach centres on creating markets for financialized ‘natural capital’ products, particularly in resource-rich, lower-income countries. The appeal of this comes from a set of policy promises termed the ‘triple-win’: achieving environmental sustainability, <b>socially</b> <b>inclusive</b> economic <b>growth</b> and poverty alleviation. Yet, these policies are controversial for many reasons, including their potential to foster inequitable property regimes, leading to increased potential for conflict. There {{is a need to}} understand the context and relationships among the green economy, resource financialization and emerging areas of conflict within the Southern African region. This will be pivotal in achieving sustainable policy reform and coordinated action. UK Department for International Developmen...|$|R
40|$|Minimum wages {{may be an}} {{important}} instrument to reduce income inequality in a society and to promote <b>socially</b> <b>inclusive</b> economic <b>growth.</b> While higher minimum wages can support the Chinese transformation towards consumption driven growth, they can worsen the price competitiveness in export markets. As they differ throughout the country, this paper investigates their determinants at the regional level. In addition to a broad set of economic determinants, such as per capita income and consumption, consumer prices, unemployment and industrial structures, spatial effects are taken into account. They might arise for different reasons, including competition of local policymakers. The results show that the impact of economic variables declines, once spatial spillovers are considered. Although the minimum wage regulation pursues the relevance of economic factors in the determination of the appropriate levels, the actual development is largely driven by regional dependencies. As minimum wage standards set by local officials do not fully reflect the regional economic development, further reforms should be on the agenda...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{widespread}} uncertainty around {{global economic}} and environmental futures has contributed to growing advocacy for a global ‘greening’ of the economy involving the coordinated establishment of pro-environment economic policies and programmes around the world (Barbier 2010; UNDESA 2009). Following the dominant framings favoured by the United Nations (UN) and partners, the term ‘green economy’ refers to a flexible policy toolkit that includes recommendations for environmental regulations, market-based and financial instruments, and voluntary initiatives to promote capitalisation of pro-environment goods and services and stimulate green economic growth (UNEMG 2011). Along these lines, a number of UN-affiliated international and regional intergovernmental organisations and development banks have developed their own complementary green growth strategies and frameworks that link up with the UN approach {{through a number of}} collaborations, agreements, mechanisms and partnerships (AfDB 2014; Fay 2012; UNDESA 2013). In this report, the terms ‘green economy’ and ‘green growth’ are used at times to reference the same thing – to refer to the common dominant principles of these approaches, namely:  Environmentally sustainable economic growth – the idea that economic growth and environmental integrity can be complementary and achievable goals within the appropriate market and regulatory contexts  <b>Socially</b> <b>inclusive</b> green <b>growth</b> – the idea that green economic growth should be pro-poor and maximise both immediate and local benefits to reduce poverty and vulnerability and long-term global benefits towards sustainability  Universality – the idea that transitions to green economies should be universal to realise a cumulative global transition towards sustainability  Flexibility – there is no single green growth model; green economic strategies will vary by region and country based on context, capabilities, preferences and funding.

40|$|Free Trade Reimagined {{begins with}} a {{sustained}} criticism of {{the heart of the}} emerging world economy, the theory and practice of free trade. Roberto Mangabeira Unger does not, however, defend protectionism against free trade. Instead, he attacks and revises the terms on which the traditional debate between free traders and protectionists has been joined. Unger's intervention in this major contemporary debate serves as a point of departure for a proposal to rethink the basic ideas with which we explain economic activity. He suggests, by example as well as by theory, a way of understanding contemporary economies that is both more realistic and more revealing of hidden possibilities for transformation than are the established forms of economics. One message of the book is that we need not choose between accepting and rejecting globalization; we can have a different globalization. Traditional free trade doctrine rests on shaky empirical and theoretical ground. Unger takes a new approach to show when international trade is likely to be useful or harmful to the <b>socially</b> <b>inclusive</b> economic <b>growth</b> that every nation wants. Another message is that the movement of people and ideas {{is more important than the}} movement of things and money, and that freedom to change the institutions defining a market economy is just as important as freedom to exchange goods on the basis of those institutions. Free Trade Reimagined ranges broadly within and outside economics. Presenting technical issues in plain language, it appeals to the general reader. It puts a disciplined imagination in the service of rebellion against the dictatorship of no alternatives that characterizes life and thought today. free trade, world economy, protectionism, economic activity, transformation, globalization, economic growth, mobility, institutional change, market economy, freedom...|$|R

Historically, while museums have been known to attract certain communities, they have also often excluded or marginalized others. In this thesis, museums with <b>socially</b> <b>inclusive</b> programming are examined to understand how museums can support engagement with groups that have not been part of traditional museum programming. A literature review and case studies of museums are conducted, and several key points in museums that are implementing <b>socially</b> <b>inclusive</b> practices are outlined, including the role of museum management, staff demographics, community relations, funding sources, and evaluation.

The first part is dedicated to provide deep insight of the concept and point the main characteristics of an <b>inclusive</b> <b>growth</b> wave.
