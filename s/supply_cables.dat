25|$|Godalming came {{to world}} {{attention}} in September 1881, {{when it became}} the first town {{in the world to}} have installed a public electricity supply. It was Calder & Barnet who installed a Siemens AC Alternator and dynamo which were powered by a waterwheel, located at Westbrook Mill, on the River Wey. There were a number of <b>supply</b> <b>cables,</b> some of which were laid in the gutters, that fed seven arc lights and 34 Swan incandescent lights. Floods in late 1881 caused problems and in the end Calder & Barnet withdrew from the contract. It was taken over by Siemens. Under Siemens the supply system grew and a number of technical problems were solved. But later on in 1884 the whole town reverted to gas lighting as Siemens failed to tender for a contract to light the town. This was due to a survey they undertook in the town that failed to provide adequate support to make the business viable. Siemens had also lost money on the scheme in the early years, but was prepared to stay on in order to gain experience. Electricity returned to the town in 1904.|$|E

2500|$|There was no {{electricity}} {{supply to the}} houses until 1938 when <b>supply</b> <b>cables</b> were laid by the municipal power authority. Ripley's Trustees required tenants {{to contribute to the}} cost of connection (£60 in 1958) so take up was slow. Some houses still used gas lighting in the 1960s.

Removal of the iron gates and railings [...] "for the war effort" [...] in 1941 had made maintenance of front gardens very difficult – especially in the internal rows where there were no garden walls.|$|E
2500|$|The {{class was}} {{designed}} to meet Channel Tunnel safety regulations, and consists of two independent half-sets, {{each with its own}} power car. Most of the trailers rest on Jacobs bogies shared between adjacent carriages, supporting both of them, with the cars next to the power cars and the two central cars (coaches 9 and 10 in a full-length set) not articulated. [...] Non-shared bogies are coupled with Scharfenberg couplers, providing three points for separation {{in the event of an}} emergency in the Channel Tunnel. The electrical <b>supply</b> <b>cables</b> between a power car and the first carriage are designed to break apart during an emergency separation. In the event of a serious fire in the Tunnel the passengers would be transferred into the undamaged half of the train, which would then be uncoupled from the damaged half and driven out of the tunnel. If the undamaged part is the rear half of the train, this would be driven by the [...] who is a fully authorised driver and occupies the rear driving cab in the tunnel for this purpose. [...] Due to limitations on driving hours, the driver and Chef du Train exchange roles for the return journey.|$|E

50|$|Nice tramway was {{originally}} {{to use the}} ground-level power supply third rail system as used by Bordeaux tramway. However, this was abandoned in favour of the more conventional overhead power <b>supply</b> <b>cables</b> providing 750 V DC, except where the tram crosses the Place Masséna and Place Garibaldi, when it lowers its pantograph and relies on its onboard nickel metal hydride batteries to cross these large open spaces, where overhead wires would be an eyesore.|$|E

50|$|The {{ground-level}} {{power supply}} system known as APS or Alimentation par le sol uses a third rail placed between the running rails, divided electrically into eight-metre segments with three-metre neutral sections in between. Each tram has two power collection skates, next to which are antennas that send radio signals to energise the power rail segments as the tram passes over them. At any one time, {{no more than two}} consecutive segments under the tram should actually be live. Alstrom developed the system primarily to avoid intrusive power <b>supply</b> <b>cables</b> in the sensitive area of the old city of Bordeaux.|$|E
50|$|Smaller {{draglines}} {{were also}} commonly used before hydraulic excavators came into common use, the smaller draglines are now rarely used other than on river and gravel pit works. The small machines {{were of a}} mechanical drive with clutches. Firms such as Ruston and Bucyrus made models such as the RB10 which were popular for small building works and drainage work. Several of these can still {{be seen in the}} English Fens of Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and parts of Norfolk. Ruston's are a company also associated with drainage pumping engines. Electric drive systems were only used on the larger mining machines, most modern machines use a diesel-hydraulic drive, as machines are seldom in one location long enough to justify the cost of installing a substation and <b>supply</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1915, {{attempts}} were also made to develop vehicles with powerful armour and armament, {{mounted on the}} cross-country chassis of agricultural tractors, with large dented wheels, such as the Aubriot-Gabet [...] "Fortress" [...] (Fortin Aubriot-Gabet).

5000|$|In 1919 the Medical Officer of Health {{reported}} that Surbiton was a residential neighbourhood with no dominating factories or works.

He advised that the Electric Light Works and a belated resuscitation of the Tolworth Brickfields represented the leading [...] " [...] Works" [...] in Surbiton.The reference to the Brickworks probably relates to it being owned by William Alen until his bankruptcy in 1881 [...] The Urban District Council entered into an agreement with Callenders Cables & Construction (later to become British Insulated Callender's Cables) under which the company laid electrical <b>supply</b> <b>cables</b> around Surbiton. In 1916 the council sold the Surbiton and District Electricity Co, based in Hollyfield Road, to Callenders.
