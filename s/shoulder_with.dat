5|$|As Prince of Wales, George Augustus {{bore the}} royal arms (with an inescutcheon of Gules plain in the Hanoverian quarter), differenced by a label of three points Argent.

The 1816 alteration did not affect him as it only applied to the arms of the King.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{proximal}} series {{can be directly}} compared to the ulnare and intermedium of tetrapods. The fin was clearly weight bearing, being attached to a massive <b>shoulder</b> <b>with</b> expanded scapular and coracoid elements and attached to the body armor, large muscular scars on the ventral surface of the humerus, and highly mobile distal joints. The bones of the forefins show large muscle facets, suggesting that the fin was both muscular and {{had the ability to}} flex like a wrist joint. These wrist-like features would have helped anchor the creature to the bottom in fast moving current.|$|E

He was taken to the North Staffordshire Hospital and during an operation received 200 stitches in his face and over 100 micro-stitches inside the socket of his right eye, and was told the chances of saving the sight in his eye were 50–50. His sight never returned, and as the loss of binocular vision severely limited his abilities as a goalkeeper, he retired from professional football the following summer.|$|E

5|$|After Collins told Polite to leave, {{she became}} {{verbally}} abusive {{of the officer}} and Collins arrested her {{on the grounds of}} disturbing the peace. Florine Roberts, the mother of Robert Bandy, a black soldier in the U.S. Army who was also present, observed the incident and asked for Polite's release. The official police report held that the soldier threatened Collins; in the report, Bandy and Mrs. Roberts then attacked Collins. Bandy hit the officer and, while attempting to flee, Collins shot Bandy in the <b>shoulder</b> <b>with</b> his revolver. In an interview with PM, the soldier said that he intervened when the officer pushed Polite. According to Bandy, Collins threw his nightstick at Bandy, which he caught. When Bandy hesitated after Collins asked for its return, Collins shot him. Bandy's wound was superficial, but he was taken to Sydenham Hospital for treatment. Crowds quickly gathered around Bandy as he entered the hospital, and also around the hotel and police headquarters, where a crowd of 3,000 amassed by 9:00 pm. The crowds combined and grew tense, as rumors that an African-American soldier had been shot soon turned to rumors that an African-American soldier had been killed.|$|E
5|$|The δ ring is {{circular}} {{and slightly}} inclined. It shows significant unexplained azimuthal variations in normal optical depth and width. One {{possible explanation is}} that the ring has an azimuthal wave-like structure, excited by a small moonlet just inside it. The sharp outer edge of the δ ring is in 23:22 resonance with Cordelia. The δ ring consists of two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad inward <b>shoulder</b> <b>with</b> low optical depth. The width of the narrow component is 4.1–6.1km and the equivalent depth is about 2.2km, which corresponds to a normal optical depth of about 0.3–0.6. The ring's broad component is about 10–12km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.3km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 3×10−2. This is known only from occultation data because Voyager 2's imaging experiment failed to resolve the δ ring. When observed in forward-scattering geometry by Voyager 2, the δ ring appeared relatively bright, which is compatible with the presence of dust in its broad component. The broad component is geometrically thicker than the narrow component. This is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the δ ring remained visible, which is consistent with the behavior of a simultaneously geometrically thick and optically thin ring.|$|E
5|$|The η ring has zero orbital {{eccentricity}} and inclination. Like the δ ring, {{it consists of}} two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad outward <b>shoulder</b> <b>with</b> low optical depth. The width of the narrow component is 1.9–2.7km and the equivalent depth is about 0.42km, which corresponds to the normal optical depth of about 0.16–0.25. The broad component is about 40km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.85km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 2×10−2. It was resolved in Voyager 2 images. In forward-scattered light, the η ring looked bright, which indicated {{the presence of a}} considerable amount of dust in this ring, probably in the broad component. The broad component is much thicker (geometrically) than the narrow one. This conclusion is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the η ring demonstrated increased brightness, becoming the second brightest feature in the ring system. This is consistent with the behavior of a geometrically thick but simultaneously optically thin ring. Like the majority of other rings, the η ring shows significant azimuthal variations in the normal optical depth and width. The narrow component even vanishes in some places.|$|E

5|$|In the 2006–07 season, Wade {{missed a}} total of 31 games due to injury. He was elected to his third {{straight}} All-Star Game and received All-NBA honors. He became the first guard to earn All-NBA honors after missing at least 31 games in a season since Pete Maravich of the Utah Jazz earned Second Team honors during the 1977–78 season. Despite Wade's play, the Heat struggled {{early in the season}} with injuries and were 20–25 on February 1, 2007. But with Shaquille O'Neal healthy and Pat Riley returning to the bench after undergoing hip and knee surgeries respectively, the Heat seemed poised to surge into {{the second half of the}} season. However, during a game against the Houston Rockets on February 21, 2007, while attempting to steal the ball from Shane Battier, Wade dislocated his left shoulder and was assisted off the court in a wheelchair. After the injury, he was left with the decision to either rehabilitate the shoulder or undergo season-ending surgery. Wade later announced that he would put off the surgery and rehabilitate his <b>shoulder</b> <b>with</b> the intention of rejoining the team in time for the playoffs. After missing 23 games to recover from the injury, Wade returned to the active roster in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats. Sporting a black sleeve to help protect his dislocated left shoulder, Wade played 27minutes and recorded 12 points and 8 assists, in an 111–103 overtime loss. For the season, Wade averaged 27.4 points, 7.5 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.1 steals per game shooting 50% from the field, and finished the season as the NBA's leader in PER (Player efficiency rating).|$|E
5|$|Scott tallied {{the go-ahead}} {{touchdown}} to complete Maryland's comeback, 20–17. The following week, Maryland fell to a heavy underdog again when a reeling Virginia team engineered a 31–0 shutout. Scott, then the leading rusher in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), had 11carries but {{was held to}} just 36yards. Despite the setback, Scott retained {{the lead in the}} ACC with 96.4rushing yards per game. After a bye week, Maryland shutout 21st-ranked Wake Forest, 26–0. Scott had 18carries for a game-high of 73yards, threw a nine-yard touchdown pass, and had three fumbles. In the first quarter, Scott fumbled at the Wake Forest 25-yard line, but was able to recover the ball. Two plays later, he executed a halfback option, where he took the handoff and threw a nine-yard pass to Heyward-Bey for a touchdown. It was Scott's first pass attempt and completion. Scott fumbled twice more in the first half, and Wake Forest recovered only to miss a field goal attempt each time. Against NC State, Scott had 23carries for 163yards and a 24-yard touchdown. In the fourth quarter, after the third play of Maryland's game-winning drive, Meggett replaced Scott, who had re-injured his <b>shoulder.</b> <b>With</b> the sixth win, Maryland attained bowl eligibility. Scott remained the ACC leading rusher with 102.6yards per game. He was deemed questionable before the Virginia Tech game, but did see action. However, the Virginia Tech line held Scott to 11yards on 10carries, although he did manage five receptions for 57yards. Against 17th-ranked North Carolina, Scott recorded 129rushing yards and a three-yard touchdown run. Maryland entered its penultimate regular season game against Florida State still within reach of the Atlantic Division title, and with it, a berth in the ACC Championship Game. Florida State, however, dashed Maryland's title hopes in a 37–3 rout in which Scott recorded 82rushing yards, but fumbled twice. In the fourth quarter, defensive end Everette Brown forced Scott to fumble, which was seen as the end to any potential comeback. Against a tough Boston College line, the Maryland rushing attack faltered, which forced quarterback Chris Turner to resort mostly to the pass. Scott rushed 13times for a gain of just 19yards.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo analyze {{changes in}} the capsule from {{idiopathic}} frozen shoulders and clarify their etiology. Materials and methodsSamples (the rotator interval capsule, middle glenohumeral ligament (MGHL), and inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL)) were collected from 12 idiopathic frozen <b>shoulders</b> <b>with</b> severe stiffness and 18 <b>shoulders</b> <b>with</b> rotator cuff tears as a control. The number of cells was counted and the tissue elasticity of the samples was calculated by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). The amount of glycosaminoglycan content was assessed by alcian blue staining. Gene and protein expressions related to fibrosis, inflammation, and chondrogenesis were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, the total genes {{of the two groups}} were compared by DNA microarray analysis. ResultsThe number of cells was significantly higher and the capsular tissue was significantly stiffer in idiopathic frozen <b>shoulders</b> compared <b>with</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>with</b> rotator cuff tears. Staining intensity of alcian blue was significantly stronger in idiopathic frozen shoulders. Gene expressions related to fibrosis, inflammation, and chondrogenesis were significantly higher in idiopathic frozen <b>shoulders</b> compared <b>with</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>with</b> rotator cuff tears assessed by both qPCR and DNA microarray analysis. ConclusionIn addition to fibrosis and inflammation, which used to be considered the main pathology of frozen shoulders, chondrogenesis is likely to have a critical role in pathogenesis of idiopathic frozen shoulders...|$|R
