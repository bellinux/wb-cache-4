50|$|Countdown {{signs are}} signs at bus stops giving users {{information}} {{about when the}} next bus is due. With iBus, Countdown is able to provide real-time information at 2,500 key bus stops in London. Communications improvements have also meant that Countdown can now display <b>service</b> updates, <b>disruption</b> <b>information</b> and network-wide messages. The roll {{out of the new}} signs at key locations was completed in June 2012. iBus was integrated with Countdown by Telent. And the signs were supplied, installed and maintenance by ACIS and Trueform. IVU.realtime from IVU Traffic Technologies AG, Germany, forms the central system of Countdown II.|$|R

40|$|Whenever {{a mobile}} node moves across {{different}} networks, <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> occurs thus making mobility management a key issue. In {{order to ensure}} the continuity of TCP session between communicating nodes, a number of protocols have been proposed so far. These protocols may be classified into two main categories: end-to-end and network-centric. As end-to-end mobility management protocols do not require additional entities in the network and no additional deployment cost is involved, that makes deployment of these protocols network operator independent. Due to these reasons end-to-end mobility management protocols are gaining popularity. However, performance evaluation of these end-to-end protocols {{on the basis of}} <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> time has not been discussed so far. This paper analyzes these protocols on the basis of <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> time using mathematical modeling techniques of performance evaluation. Results show that <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> time of protocols that allow simultaneous communication through multiple interfaces is always smaller than the protocols that do not allow simultaneous communication.

40|$|Abstract Various {{operational}} {{strategies for}} mitigating supply chain disruption {{have been studied}} theoretically, but few studies have investigated behavioral decision-making in multi-echelon supply chains experiencing disruptions. We explore the effects of communicating <b>disruption</b> <b>information</b> in real-time to supply chain members using the beer distribution game in a controlled laboratory setting. Both upstream (manufacturer) and downstream (retailer) disruptions are independently considered, and {{in each of these}} scenarios, the difference between sharing and not sharing the <b>disruption</b> <b>information</b> is investigated. We find that supply chain disruptions may cause higher order variability when compared to the base case (no disruption). For a disruption at an upstream echelon, sharing the <b>disruption</b> <b>information</b> is found beneficial in reducing order variability and supply chain costâ€”upstream echelons experience more benefits from information sharing than downstream echelons. Therefore, we advocate that manufacturers share supply <b>disruption</b> <b>information</b> in real-time in order to benefit from a reduced bullwhip effect and its associated costs. For a disruption at a downstream echelon, sharing <b>disruption</b> <b>information</b> {{does not appear to have}} a significant benefit. Past studies have shown the importance of sharing downstream inventory information with upstream supply chain members. In the event of disruptions, our results demonstrate that sharing upstream <b>disruption</b> <b>information</b> with downstream members is beneficial...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{disasters}} cause large-scale {{network service}} interruption which corresponds to unreachability of networks. This problem relates to how networks respond under extreme conditions, {{and it is}} neither well-studied nor well-understood. To infer network <b>service</b> <b>disruption,</b> challenges arise, i. e., how to use heterogeneous data that include sensory measurements and human inputs? This work shows an important role of data mining and machine learning in inferring large-scale network <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> upon Hurricane Katrina. We present a joint use of large-scale sensory measurements from Internet and {{a small number of}} human inputs for effective network inference. Specifically, data mining includes (a) unsupervised learning, i. e., clustering and feature extraction of sensory measurements and (b) semi-supervised learning of both sensory measurements and human inputs. The approaches are evaluated on network <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> induced by Hurricane Katrina at subnet level. Our result shows that clustering reduces the spatial dimensionality by 81 %, and sensory measurements are temporally extracted down to two features. The subnet statuses inferred by the classifier derived from semi-supervised learning show interesting facts of network resilience and provide the spatial and the temporal maps of network <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> {{that can be used to}} assist disaster response and recovery. To our understanding, this is the first work of data mining and machine learning using sensory measurements and human inputs for inference of large-scale network <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> upon a large-scale natural disaster...|$|R
40|$|The phenomenal {{growth of}} group {{communications}} and QoS-aware applications over the Internet have accelerated {{the development of}} multicasting technologies. The Core-Based Tree (CBT) multicasting approach provides a scalable solution for large groups for large networks such as the Internet. However, unlike in shortest-path trees, the quality (tree cost) of the CBT may eventually degrade over time due to group dynamics (join/leave). In order to counteract this degradation, the core may be migrated and a new tree constructed. The method of migrating group members from the old core to the new core has {{a profound impact on}} the quality of the tree and also on the <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> experienced by group members. Thus, there exists a trade-off between tree cost and <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> as higher rate of migration decreases the overall tree cost but results in more <b>service</b> <b>disruption.</b> In [1], we developed the concept of tree migration. In this paper, we develop a new paradigm for tree migration, namely tree evolution. The proposed tree evolution model (Split-based Tree Evolution Protocol (STEP)) provides an elegant solution that strikes a balance between <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> and tree cost for highly dynamic groups. In this paper, we compare and contrast the merits of tree evolution versus tree migration. Our simulation studies show that the proposed evolution model demonstrates excellent tree cost and <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> for highly dynamic groups...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”We {{address a}} unique {{security}} threat that arises due to channel fragmentation (or aggregation or bonding) in dynamic spectrum access (DSA) based IEEE 802. 22 networks. Typically, channel fragmentation, aggregation and bonding {{have been studied}} in the literature {{as a means to}} enhance the spectrum utilization. However, the loss of orthogonality between the spectrum bands due to channel fragmentation, aggregation or bonding can be exploited by malicious attackers to cause a cognitive <b>service</b> <b>disruption.</b> We present an analysis of such a threat. We determine the optimal transmit powers a malicious attacker transmits on each fragment, so as to create maximum <b>service</b> <b>disruption.</b> Numerical results indicate that a malicious attacker can cause up to about 16 % loss in the capacity of the system as a consequence of fragmentation. Detailed analysis is presented for channel fragmentation and can be easily applied to channel aggregation and bonding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis of such cognitive <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> threats due to fragmentation...|$|R
