In the preset article heat conduction was described and analytical and numerical methods to solve a heat transfer problem were presented.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 This {{study was}} a {{comparison}} of the prevalence of infectious gastrointestinal disease and the quality of construction of individual, <b>surface</b> <b>source</b> water systems in Lincoln County, Oregon. Two measurement instruments were developed for this study. An objective instrument was developed to determine if the water systems observed in the study were adequately or inadequately constructed. A second objective instrument was developed to determine if individuals interviewed in the study were ill with an infectious gastrointestinal disease. The Delphi Method was used to validate the two instruments, and was based on a concensus of opinions by a panel of experts regarding this subject matter. The sample population was identified through a systematic selection of dwellings using a Lincoln County Department of Engineers road map and a list of random numbers. Individuals were interviewed using the <b>Surface</b> <b>Source</b> Water System Gastrointestinal Disease Evaluation instrument to determine if they had an infectious gastrointestinal disease. The <b>surface</b> <b>source</b> water systems were evaluated using the Individual <b>Surface</b> <b>Source</b> Water System Evaluation Instrument to determine if they were adequately constructed. Subsequently, the individuals were categorized as being ill or not ill. The water systems were all categorized as being adequately or inadequately constructed. The chi square statistic was used to determine if {{there was a significant difference}} between the number of people with and without an infectious gastrointestinal disease using inadequately constructed individual, <b>surface</b> <b>source</b> water systems. Also, the chi square statistic was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the number of people with and without an infectious gastrointestinal disease using adequately constructed, individual, <b>surface</b> <b>source</b> water systems. The statistical analysis revealed that there were significantly more well people than ill people using both types of water systems at a significance level of 0. 05. Because of a lack of clear differentiation in the data, the common public health concept that quality of construction of individual <b>surface</b> <b>source</b> water systems as a factor in the spread of infectious gastrointestinal diseases cannot be supported or refuted. A major recommendation was to repeat the study by examining the water directly using laboratory techniques. This would positively establish the presence or absence of a disease causing organism in the water system. A literature search by the author revealed that effective measurement instruments for evaluation of relationships of gastrointestinal diseases and well construction quality were not readily available. The instruments developed by the author may require further testing to yield more definitive data...|$|E

40|$|For {{the study}} of ground-borne {{vibration}} from <b>surface</b> <b>sources,</b> it is commonly assumed that soil properties remain constant with depth. However, various studies {{in the field of}} geotechnical engineering have shown that soil properties (stiffness and damping) change with depth due to the effect of increasing confining stress. Ground-borne vibration is hence unrealistically simulated if constant soil properties are assumed throughout a half space or a soil layer. This paper presents a study of the effect of the variation of soil properties with depth, referred to as soil non-homogeneity, on ground-borne vibrations induced by <b>surface</b> <b>sources.</b> The study involved physical modelling using a geotechnical centrifuge and numerical modelling using EDT and FLAC to gain further understanding of experimental results. In the centrifuge model, a dynamic excitation was applied to a rigid foundation resting on the surface of sand within a cylindrical container. Dynamic soil response was measured using accelerometers on the surface and within the soil. Comparison of the experimental and numerical results demonstrated {{that it is important to}} account for the variation of soil properties with depth when studying ground-borne vibration from <b>surface</b> <b>sources...</b>|$|R

In addition to the <b>surface</b> <b>sources</b> and recei-vers, a high-temperature three-component seismometer was deployed in a borehole {{at a depth of}} 1250 m within the basement below the reservoir, which recorded the waves generated by all <b>surface</b> <b>sources.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the subsurface structure of the reservoir based on this surface-to-borehole dataset. A total of 1959 first-arrival travel times were determined out of 2134 possible traces. Two-dimensional ray tracing was performed to simulate wave propagation from the <b>surface</b> <b>sources</b> to the receiver at depth. The ray tracing was based on a 2 -D laterally homogeneous velocity model derived from results of a vertical-seismic-profile (VSP) experiment recorded in the same well. The method is an approximation where it is assumed that differences in travel time between the observed and modeled data are caused by structural deviations from a homogeneously layered model as estimated by the VSP profile, and thus are mapped into topographic changes at depth.

The nonlinear or exact body boundary condition is captured by regridding the wetted body surface at each time step.

The nonlinear effects caused by the variation of the wetted body surface are evaluated based on this method.
