'10 P.M. - This <b>second</b> <b>length</b> of three-wire cable soon {{got into}} the same {{condition}} as its fellow - i.e. came up twenty kinks an hour - and after seven miles were in, parted on the pulley over the bows {{at one of the}} said kinks; during my watch again, but this time no earthly power could have saved it. I had taken all manner of precautions to prevent the end doing any damage when the smash came, for come I knew it must. We now return to the six-wire cable. As I sat watching the cable to-night, large phosphorescent globes kept rolling from it and fading in the black water.|$|E

5000|$|In 1968, Time {{acknowledged}} Webb's range, proficiency, and [...] "gift for strong, varied rhythms, inventive structures, and rich, sometimes surprising harmonies". That year, {{the string}} of successful Jimmy Webb songs continued with The 5th Dimension's [...] "Paper Cup" [...] and [...] "Carpet Man" [...] reaching the Top 40, Glen Campbell's [...] "Wichita Lineman" [...] selling over a million copies, and Johnny Maestro & the Brooklyn Bridge scoring a gold record with [...] "The Worst That Could Happen", a song originally recorded by The 5th Dimension. Webb formed his own production and publishing company that year, Canopy, and scored a hit with its first project, an unlikely album with Irish actor Richard Harris singing an album of all Jimmy Webb songs. One of the songs, [...] "MacArthur Park", was a long, complex piece with multiple movements that was originally rejected by the group The Association. Despite the song's seven minute, twenty-one <b>second</b> <b>length,</b> Richard Harris' version reached #2 on the Hot 100 on 22 June 1968. The Richard Harris album A Tramp Shining stayed on the charts for almost a year. Webb and Harris produced a follow-up album, The Yard Went On Forever, which was also successful. At the 1969 Grammy Awards, Webb accepted awards for [...] "By the Time I Get to Phoenix," [...] "Wichita Lineman," [...] and [...] "MacArthur Park." ...|$|E
5000|$|Secret Dreams and Forbidden Fire {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, {{with much of}} the criticism being aimed at music producer and hit songwriter Jim Steinman. Steven Wine criticized the length of the tracks, stating that [...] "only Bonnie Tyler's parents would want to listen to her sing the same song for six minutes, but three of the eight tunes on album exceed that span." [...] He went on to describe the album as a [...] "bombastic bore," [...] only crediting one of Steinman's penned songs, [...] "Ravishing". Tom Ford of Toledo Blade stated that [...] "although Tyler proves able to do some interesting things, she is outdistanced by the tiresome ponderousness of the material," [...] concluding that [...] "the prissy, self-indulgence here is just too much to stand." [...] Paul Speelman of The Age opined that Tyler and Steinman were [...] "deeply entrenched in a rut", and found the music to be excessive. [...] "There are banks of synthesizers, layers of percussion, dramatic electronic gimmickry and huge production: no wonder poor old Bonnie had to yell to be heard above that lot," [...] he said, praising Tyler's voice. [...] "The fact that she manages to salvage at least a few tracks attests to her vocal fortitude." [...] He argued that the album was a case of over-indulgence, noting the eight minute and thirty-five <b>second</b> <b>length</b> of [...] "Rebel Without a Clue".|$|E

40|$|The depth {{dependence}} of the crystallographic parameters mosaicity, lattice parameter variation and integrated reflectivity and of the critical scattering above the 105 K structural phase transition of SrTiO$_ 3 $ have been studied in five different single crystals by means of high resolution triple-crystal diffractometry using 100 - 120 keV synchrotron radiation. Depth-dependent impedance measurements indicate {{that the presence of}} oxygen vacancies is not responsible for the two-length scale phenomenon. It is found that the sharp component occurs only in surface near regions of highly perfect single crystals and is coupled to an exponential inrease of the crystallographic quantities. The <b>second</b> <b>length</b> scale is absent at a surface where the strain fields are able to relax by a macroscopic bending of the lattice planes. The sharp component is also strongly suppressed in crystals of relatively large mosaicity. The combination of long range strain fields in highly perfect samples and the vicinity of the surface seem to be necessary conditions for the observation of the sharp component. The critical exponents for the <b>second</b> <b>length</b> scale are in satisfying agreement with scaling laws if the intensity of the critical scattering is assumed to be proportional to the square of the Lorentzian susceptibility and not, as usual in the current convention, to a Lorentzian-squared susceptibility. The critical exponents of the broad component are independent of the appearance of the sharp component. Comment: 29 pages, 15 figures. submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|E
30|$|These {{differences}} in nano-scale morphology identify several scales of MRO for HfO 2, {{as well as}} other TM d 0 oxides, TiO 2 and ZrO 2. The first is the PUC ~ 0.5 to 0.55 nm, and the second and third are for coupling of unit cells. The first coupling is manifest in 1.5 – 2.0 nm grains that are analogues of the SiO 2 clusters comprised of 2 – 3 symmetric six-member rings. The <b>second</b> <b>length</b> scale is 3 – 3.5 nm and is sufficient to promote J–T distortion which persist in thicker annealed film and bulk crystals as well. The PUC of HfO 2 then plays the same role as the symmetric or regular six-member ring of non-crystalline SiO 2 and in crystalline a-quartz.|$|E

However, to define the spatial resolution associated with displacement measurements of global DVC a <b>second</b> <b>length</b> is also evaluated. It corresponds to the cubic root of the mean number of voxels considered for the nodal displacement measurement. This length ℓ _g defines the spatial resolution of the measurement technique.

40|$|We find pp wave {{solutions}} in string theory with null-like linear dilatons. These provide toy models of big bang cosmologies. We formulate Matrix String Theory in these backgrounds. Near {{the big bang}} ``singularity'', the string theory becomes strongly coupled but the Yang-Mills description of the matrix string is weakly coupled. The presence of a <b>second</b> <b>length</b> scale allows us {{to focus on a}} specific class of non-abelian configurations, viz. fuzzy cylinders, for a suitable regime of parameters.

40|$|Analysis of a {{microscopic}} Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson model of 3 D short-ranged wetting shows that correlation functions {{are characterized by}} two length scales, not one, as previously thought. This has a simple diagrammatic explanation using a nonlocal interfacial Hamiltonian and yields a thermodynamically consistent theory of wetting in keeping with exact sum rules. For critical wetting the <b>second</b> <b>length</b> serves to lower the cutoff in the spectrum of interfacial fluctuations determining the repulsion from the wall. We show how this corrects previous renormalization group predictions for fluctuation effects, based on local interfacial Hamiltonians. In particular, lowering the cutoff leads to a substantial reduction in the effective value of the wetting parameter and prevents the transition being driven first order. Quantitative comparison with Ising model simulation studies due to Binder, Landau, and co-workers is also mad...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of solution-cast, phase-separated polymers becomes finer {{with increasing}} solvent evaporation rate. We address this observation theoretically for a model polymer where demixing is induced by steady solvent evaporation. In contrast {{to what is}} the case for a classical, thermal quench involving immiscible blends, the spinodal instability initially develops slowly and the associated length scale is not time invariant but decreases with time as t(- 1 / 2). After a time lag, phase separation accelerates. Time lag and characteristic length exhibit power-law behavior {{as a function of the}} evaporation rate with exponents of - 2 / 3 and - 1 / 6. Interestingly, at later stages the spinodal structure disappears completely while a <b>second</b> <b>length</b> scale develops.
