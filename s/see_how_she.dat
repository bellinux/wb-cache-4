5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, it was hard to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy {{for women}} has its hardships. Women lock {{themselves}} {{away in the}} woods inside a hut to keep pregnancy localized, only mothers and grandmothers see the women during labor to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> is doing. Pregnant women {{have to deal with}} the pregnancy with the help of other women while the men go along their day like nothing else is happening. They are more pleased with the birth of a girl than that of a boy. The reason being is for the sake of multiplication, in other words, even though women are sent away for their pregnancy, they are given more praise for women being born.|$|E

500|$|These {{performances}} {{were not enough}} to gain selection in the Test and one-day series against India held in Adelaide immediately after the WNCL. However, Poulton was called up for her senior international debut against New Zealand in the Rose Bowl series staged at Allan Border Field in Brisbane {{at the start of}} the 2006–07 season because of an injury to fellow New South Wales batsman Alex Blackwell. The chairman of selectors Margaret Jennings said [...] "She is a talented player with a free-flowing game, and we are keen to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> performs against New Zealand, whom we expect to provide some very tough competition." [...] Poulton played in all of the matches. She made 10 in her Twenty20 international debut and the match ended in a tie.|$|E
500|$|Breckin was {{directed}} by Olly Blackburn in the thriller film Donkey Punch; she portrayed the character Lisa and starred alongside Jaime Winstone, Nichola Burley, Tom Burke and Julian Morris. She commented to the Yorkshire Evening Post about her experience acting in the film: [...] "Filming {{it was such a}} wonderful experience. I learned an incredible amount and the team became very close. We are all incredibly proud of the film." [...] Breckin told the Irish Independent the intent was to portray realistic scenes in the film: [...] "We wanted it as realistic as possible in terms of young people having fun. Sex isn't glamorous[...]" [...] She commented to Sky News: [...] "It's about us, it's about young people. Hopefully people can identify with that. It had to be that the audience can relate to my character, that they can <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> gets herself in certain situations and how easily that can happen." [...] Donkey Punch is Breckin's first feature film. LoveFilm observed that Donkey Punch is [...] "acted with conviction by a cast of newcomers".|$|E
500|$|Yahoo! Voices {{wrote that}} Stevens [...] {{in the third}} season [...] "has become more condescending and passive {{aggressive}} herself, more than anyone else." [...] Heigl was critical of her character's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George, which she deemed [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot." [...] Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that: People who are so infallible, perfect and moral tend {{to be the first to}} slip and fall. But I would love to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> deals with the consequences of what she's done, because what’s interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was capable of this.' I'd like to see Izzie take some culpability.|$|E

500|$|In October 2007, drinks' {{industry}} {{body the}} Portman Group made an official complaint to communications regulator Ofcom about {{a scene in}} Holby City which depicted two medics drinking five shots of tequila following a stressful day at work. The body's chief executive David Poley claimed that in failing to show {{the negative consequences of}} this action, the series was presenting a [...] "highly irresponsible portrayal of excessive and rapid drinking". Ofcom received a total of eight complaints about the incident. In response to the accusation that [...] "We would expect the BBC to take greater care with the portrayal of alcohol in programmes", the BBC released a statement tying the complaint closely to the alcoholism storyline being played out with Kyla at the time, explaining that: [...] "Holby City {{is in the middle of}} a storyline in which a key character (Kyla) has spiralling problems in her personal and professional life because of alcohol — a storyline that fully and realistically depicts the negative impact of alcohol dependency in the workplace. Kyla has now been seen to seek help for alcoholism and the audience will <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> fares on the road to recovery." ...|$|E
500|$|Kanami Sekiguchi {{was chosen}} as the {{character}} designer after Horikawa took notice of her work as the animation director of episode nine of Angel Beats!, and Toba was eager to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> would render Na-Ga's original designs. When it came time to choose an art director, Kazuki Higashiji was chosen for his zeal in the workplace and Horikawa's confidence in his artistic talent; Higashiji had also been the art director for Angel Beats!. Similarly, Satoki Iida was brought back to work on Charlotte again as the sound and music director, and he also helped with the proofreading of the script as he had done for Angel Beats!. Iida was largely chosen for his good communication with Maeda, and so that he could make the best use of his experience working on Angel Beats!. When writing the music for How-Low-Hello, Maeda reused some older songs he had composed as a student in the 1990s that he felt were selective of his best songs from that period. At the time, his concept when composing the songs was [...] "early B'z", but Maeda notes that this is no longer the case with the completed songs.|$|E
2500|$|Tunney {{moved to}} the City of Liverpool {{gymnastics}} club when she {{was ten years old}} to train with coach, Claire Duffy. [...] Duffy said, [...] "She was tiny, quite scruffy and overwhelmed by the environment, but keen and excited {{to get in there and}} give it a go. When she first won a medal, you could <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> loved to train to win. She'd had a taste of medals and that was exactly what she wanted to do: she wanted to be a champion." ...|$|E

Because the show predates actually feasible real-world video communication {{by more than a}} decade, this only adds to the comedy.|$|R

2500|$|Kojima {{also said}} about her clothing, [...] "Once you <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> {{fits into the}} story, you will {{understand}} why she looks the way she does. Without any of this background I can certainly understand why there are concerns. I will say there’s a reason she looks the way she does and wears those clothes. And it’s all {{a part of the}} game, learning those reasons one by one." [...] Joosten herself was surprised with the controversy, but said [...] "When I got to see her design, I was shocked too. But everybody didn’t get to hear her story yet so I can understand people are angry about it or saying she is showing too much. But I am not bothered by it.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{approval}} of devotions relevant to an apparition, {{in the absence}} of a formal {{approval of}} the apparition itself, has caused some confusion regarding which apparitions have been formally approved by the Roman Catholic Church. For example, the 2012 book by Joan Carroll Cruz, <b>See</b> <b>How</b> <b>She</b> Loves Us: 50 Approved Apparitions of Our Lady (which contained a nihil obstat and imprimatur from church officials), included in its list of supposedly [...] "approved" [...] apparitions some for which [...] "approval for expressions of faith had been granted, though the investigation of the apparition [...] still under way" [...] and noted that bishops historically [...] "implied their approval by permitting churches to be built as requested by the vision". As a result, Cruz's list contains some apparitions, such as Our Lady of Pellevoisin, that have not been formally approved.|$|E
2500|$|Trinny and Susannah {{then take}} their pink box {{in search of}} older women {{to talk about their}} clothing. They find that many of them feel a lack of {{confidence}} and hide themselves behind clothing, and do not have any knowledge of what to wear. Then the process of Susannah being aged through prosthetics begins. To give an accurate depiction of how Susannah would look at the age of 70 years, a plastic surgeon and prosthetic expert take details of her lifestyle and examine past pictures to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> is aging. When the face mask and body suit are fitted, Susannah is clearly distressed and states [...] "There is no way I'm going to look like this when I'm 70. I will not dress like this and I will not allow my face to become like this." [...] An elderly woman, Shirly Tripe, then takes Susannah shopping to find her some clothing from her own favourite shops. Susannah comments on Shirley's choice: [...] "It's a sack. This is a testament that older women, or mature women, benefit so much from tailoring." [...] Susannah then meets a shocked Trinny with her new appearance. The two fashionistas then aim to tackle what they believe older women should avoid; wearing loose fitting clothes. They take Shirley shopping to get some tighter fitting clothes, although Shirley shows much resistance and claims she looks like 'mutton dressed as lamb'.|$|E

2500|$|On May 12, 2011, Hilton {{opened her}} third {{store in the}} Philippines. The store, in the Abreeza Mall in Davao City, {{featured}} bags, earrings, wallets, belts, caps and perfumes. On June 1, she returned to reality television in Oxygen's The World According to Paris. The show, which followed her daily life, attracted 409,000 viewers. It was not a success, however, {{which led to a}} belief that Hilton's popularity was fading. The New York Times wrote that she [...] "is an attractive woman with proven talent for marketing and self-promotion, though as a reality heroine she seems a little passé—a Sony Walkman in an iPod era, a Friendster in the age of Facebook or, to put it in context, a single-process blonde in a triple-process world", also saying that she [...] "appears to have plenty of boyfriends, present and ex. Paparazzi still snap her picture. But it's hard to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> can recapture the kind of audience she enjoyed in her heyday—even by streaming her premiere live on Facebook". Hilton appeared on the show with her boyfriend, Las Vegas nightclub owner Cy Waits, with whom she broke up in June. She was labeled a [...] "Billion Dollar Entrepreneur" [...] by Variety magazine, and was featured on its cover. Hilton opened her fourth store in the Philippines on August 18, 2011. In September she introduced a footwear line in Istanbul; a Paris Hilton store opened in India, with plans for eight more. Hilton modeled for designer Andre Tan during Ukraine Fashion Week in October 2011.|$|E
2500|$|He became Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, {{hoisting}} his flag in {{the battleship}} HMS Lord Warden, in April 1869.

[...] "In the autumn of 1870 the Mediterranean Squadron, {{under the command of}} Sir Alexander Milne joined up with the Channel Squadron for the purpose of carrying out combined manoeuvres off the coast of Portugal, and Sir Alexander, being the senior admiral, took supreme command. [...] The low freeboard, fully rigged turret-ship Captain had joined the Channel Squadron a short time before, and the combined fleet put to see from Vigo". [...] On 6 September [...] "the fleet was sailing in two columns on the starboard tack in a fresh north-west breeze, and Sir Alexander Milne went on board the Captain in the afternoon to inspect her and <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> behaved at sea, as she was a novelty... During the time the Commander-in-Chief was on board the Captain the wind and sea had increased, and he had great difficulty in getting back to his own ship – the Lord Warden. [...] In fact, the captain of the Captain (Hugh Burgoyne) tried to persuade him not to risk it, but to remain on board for the night and return in the morning. [...] Sir Alexander, however, was a dour auld Scotsman and said he would get back to his ship, and did." [...] That night the Captain capsized and sank and [...] "only the gunner and seventeen men were saved." ...|$|E
