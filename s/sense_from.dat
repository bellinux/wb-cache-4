25|$|Playoffs {{were also}} needed in Group 1 (Northern Ireland beat Czechoslovakia {{to join the}} {{defending}} champions West Germany in the quarter-finals) and Group 3 (Wales topped Hungary to advance with hosts Sweden).

They had lost their best players two years before, when they fled {{in the wake of the}} failed uprising against the communist regime.

Jazani believed in the current situation one should not limit their means to one method but we should prepare the people in a political <b>sense</b> <b>from</b> all sides. With this effort one can fight against injustice and dictatorship for a better life for all people. This will first fix the problem with communication between people and second the social injustices develop a populous sense against the Shah in Iran and the world, and a dictator regime would fall.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the season, the 76ers dealt Chamberlain to the Los Angeles Lakers for Archie Clark, Darrall Imhoff and Jerry Chambers. At the time, {{the trade}} {{appeared}} to make some <b>sense</b> <b>from</b> the Sixers' perspective. Chamberlain was making noises about jumping to the American Basketball Association, and GM Jack Ramsay didn't want to risk letting Chamberlain walk away for nothing. Nonetheless, the Sixers didn't get nearly enough in return. The man who was in position to take over as the center, Lucious Jackson, suffered a severe injury in 1969 and was never the same player after that. The Chamberlain trade sent the Sixers into a freefall, which Ramsay accelerated by subsequent divestiture of All Star forward Chet Walker to the Chicago Bulls.|$|E

25|$|Most Hometown Hockey {{games are}} aired in primetime, {{although}} it has infrequently aired afternoon games—such as in 2015, the Sunday half of the Montreal Canadiens' traditional pair of home games on Super Bowl weekend. At least one Canadian-based franchise is featured on Hometown Hockey, although it may also air a game between two American-based teams, provided {{that there are no}} scheduled games involving Canadian teams on a Sunday. The games were carried by City during its inaugural season, although infrequently moved to Sportsnet in the event of scheduling conflicts. Beginning in the 2015-16 season, Hometown Hockey was moved exclusively to Sportsnet; Moore explained that introducing Hometown Hockey on City was intended to incubate the brand, but that airing it on Sportsnet made <b>sense</b> <b>from</b> an economic standpoint due to its status as a pay channel, and enabled City to return to entertainment programming on Sundays.|$|E
25|$|Henry Gray {{wrote the}} {{original}} version of Gray's Anatomy with an audience of medical students and physicians in mind, especially surgeons. For many decades however, precisely because Gray's textbook became such a classic, successive editors made major efforts to preserve its position as possibly the most authoritative text on the subject in English. Toward this end, a long-term strategy {{appears to have been}} to make each edition come close to containing a fully comprehensive account of the anatomical medical understanding available at the time of publication. Given the explosion of medical knowledge in the 20th century, it is easily appreciated that this led to a vast expansion of the book, which threatened to collapse under its own weight in a metaphorical and physical <b>sense.</b> <b>From</b> the 35th edition onward, increased efforts were made to reverse this trend and keep the book readable by students. Nevertheless, the 38th edition contained 2,092 pages in large format – the highest page count of any and an increase from the 35th edition, which had 1,471 pages. The current 41st edition has 1,584 pages.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the album, DOOM uses {{a number}} of {{literary}} devices, including multi-syllable rhymes, internal rhymes, alliteration, assonance, and holorimes. Music critics also noted extensive use of wordplay and double entendres. PopMatters wrote, [...] "You can spend hours poring over the lyric sheet and attempting to grok Doom’s infinitely dense verbiage. If language is arbitrary, then many of Doom’s verses exploit the essence of words stripped of meaning, random conglomerations of syllables assembled in an order that only makes <b>sense</b> <b>from</b> a rhythmical standpoint", the critic added. The Observer stated that [...] "the densely telegraphic lyrics almost always reward closer inspection" [...] and that DOOM's [...] "rhymes miss beats, drop {{into the middle of}} the next line, work their way through whole verses" [...] allows for a smooth listen.|$|E

[...] Boone's death is notable as the first death of a major character on the series. According to executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, Boone's death made <b>sense</b> <b>from</b> a story perspective to fuel the rivalry between Jack and Locke and lead to the events in the season finale. [...] Following Somerhalder's departure from the show, ABC signed him to another one-year contract.

500|$|Along with Kung Lao, Liu Kang is {{the lead}} {{character}} in the 2005 spinoff action-adventure game [...] The game is a retelling of the storyline of the {{events leading up to}} Mortal Kombat II, and features the two Shaolin monks traveling to Outworld to find and defeat Shang Tsung, later ending in a fight with Shao Kahn and rescuing Kitana along the way. He is among the eleven characters representing the Mortal Kombat franchise in the 2008 crossover title Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, which features fights between characters from the Mortal Kombat and the DC Comics universes. In this game, Liu Kang appears as the protagonist of the first chapter of the Mortal Kombat story mode. Tobias said that the fight he expected to see in the game was between Liu Kang and Batman as he noted their back-stories to be very similar, due to fact, both Liu Kang and Batman are fought in Raiden and Superman's chapters respectively, trying to snap their rage influenced respective leaders back to their <b>sense</b> <b>from</b> killing the leader's respective arch-enemies, Lex Luthor and Shang Tsung, reminding them that Dark Kahn is their true enemy.|$|E

500|$|By the 1980s new Keynesian economists became {{dissatisfied}} with these early nominal wage contract models since they predicted that real wages would be countercyclical (real wages would rise {{when the economy}} fell), while empirical evidence showed that real wages tended to be independent of economic cycles or even slightly procyclical. These contract models also did not make <b>sense</b> <b>from</b> a microeconomic standpoint since it was unclear why firms would use long-term contracts if they led to inefficiencies. Instead of looking for rigidities in the labor market, new Keynesians shifted {{their attention to the}} goods market and the sticky prices that resulted from [...] "menu cost" [...] models of price change. The term refers to the literal cost to a restaurant of printing new menus when it wants to change prices; however, economists also use it to refer to more general costs associated with changing prices, including the expense of evaluating whether to make the change. Since firms must spend money to change prices, they do not always adjust them to the point where markets clear, and this lack of price adjustments can explain why the economy may be in disequilibrium. Studies using data from the United States Consumer Price Index confirmed that prices do tend to be sticky. A good's price typically changes about every four to six months or, if sales are excluded, every eight to eleven months.|$|E
