40|$|For direct {{measuring}} of {{the maximum}} gas outlet cooling temperature in the flowing core of the pebble-bed reactor AVR Juelich there were used flattened graphite spheres (moderator spheres). These spheres, also called gas temperature measuring elements, contained 34 or 68 thin wires of different metals and metalalloys,which melt reaching their melting point. The wires itselves were in little Al$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 3 }$ or graphite melting pots or they were melted in quartz ampules. Melting pots and ampules were admitted in a holder. The gas temperature measuring element was supplied with cooling Channels for a better cooling gas flow through the sphere. For {{the determination of the}} hold-up time of the balls in the core and and for the estimation of their way through the core the spheres were caught in a special collecting tank with a <b>spiral</b> <b>chute</b> and a counter. At the same time the behaviour of quartz under high radiation dose and under high temperatures wasinvestigated. To save time and money a new radiographic method of post-investigation was developed. With the aid of their residual activity the melted or on-melted indicators were made visible on a special film. A comparison was made for theoretical calculated and with the aid of the test balls measured temperatures...|$|E

50|$|Peel {{gave the}} ergot {{business}} the name Universal Laboratories. Production initially began with ergotic rye bought from local farmers. Universal Laboratories staff would then bring the rye through small mills that would {{break up the}} rye kernels. They would then pick the grain from the conveyor belt and let the ergot fall into a receptacle for bagging. The company also hired people to work from their homes in Dassel picking and bagging ergot. Later, the process was improved by new machines that automated the process of separating the ergot from the rye. The grain was passed through mills that would flow into gravity separators, which had <b>spiraling</b> <b>chutes</b> that would separate the light ergot kernels from the heavier rye kernels.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the building, as befit a warehouse, was relatively spartan. Five elevators were grouped {{in the center of}} the structure, and a pneumatic tube network installed in the shafts as a space-saving measure. The building also featured several <b>spiral</b> package <b>chutes,</b> and an exterior surface parking lot.|$|R
40|$|The work {{covers the}} vibration-movable high-concentrated {{dispersed}} systems with heat-transfer agent feed above its free surface. The {{aim of the}} work is to investigate the heat exchange between gas flow blown above vibration-boiling layer, and effective heat conduction of the latter. The new regularities of the heat exchange between vibration-boiling layer and gas blown above it have been determined experimentally, the new data on the effective layer heat conduction in vertical direction have been obtained. The empirical equations on the heat exchange and tables of the effective heat conduction coefficients constituting a base for engineering designs of the vibration equipment with horizontal chutes and vertical equipment with <b>spiral</b> <b>chutes</b> have been drawn up. The recommendations on the selection of condition parameters and design dimensions of the vertical vibration equipment for thermal and chemical-thermal treatment of the loose materials have been developed and introduced. The results have been used by the All-Russian Research Institute of Non-Organic Materials for thermal design of the vertical vibration equipment - oxidizer of spent fuel on the nuclear power stationsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
