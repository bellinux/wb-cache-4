5|$|Revealing Chicago: An Aerial Portrait was {{displayed}} on the Central Chase Promenade and South Boeing Gallery from June 10 to October 10, 2005. The exhibit featured 100 images from Chicago metropolitan area taken on 50 flights that occurred between March 2003 and August 2004 at various seasons of the year. Photographer Terry Evans, a Chicagoan, <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> 90% of the photographs were taken while in a helicopter, her preferred method of travel is hot air balloon, but Chicago was usually too windy to shoot by balloon.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to continually retain or return gifted experts (Experten) to front line battle proved extremely costly, {{resulting in the}} death in combat {{of many of the}} earlier experts and aces. This, coupled with the acute shortage of well trained pilots and the fact that by 1943 they were facing a better equipped and well-trained enemy, meant the life expectancy of even the most gifted was tragically short. Author John Weal <b>says</b> <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> other Geschwaderkommodore would end up dying in combat, nothing would showcase the changing fortunes of Luftwaffe fighter forces than the death of Walter Oesau.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff are}} {{preparing}} to write sketches for TGS with Tracy Jordan when Jack arrives and announces that he went through a program at General Electric (GE) called Six Sigma, which encourages bosses to interact with their staff. He tells Liz and the writers {{that he will be}} sitting in the writers' room every day as an observer. As days pass, Jack begins to interfere with the writers' work, and instead of just being an observer, he regularly gives the writers ideas for upcoming sketches. This causes a major frustration for the staff, so Liz tells Jack that the writers do not like his involvement. Jack <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> he enjoyed joining the writers every day, he tells Liz that he accepts their decision.|$|E

5|$|Mughal-e-Azam takes {{numerous}} liberties {{with historical}} fact. Historian Alex von Tunzelmann <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> the real Salim {{was a heavy}} consumer of alcohol and opium {{from the age of}} 18, he was not necessarily a mischievous boy, as depicted in the film. When the film's Salim returns from his time in the military, he is depicted as a gentle and romantic hero, in contrast to the real Salim, who was documented as a brutal drunk who would often beat people to death. The real Salim did lead a rebellion against his father, tried to replace him as emperor, and had Akbar's friend Abu al-Fazl murdered in 1602, but the film ascribes these actions to his desire to marry Anarkali, which is historically inaccurate. Further, there were also discrepancies in sets, costumes, and music of the film. The Sheesh Mahal, actually the royal bath of the queen, was depicted in the film as a dancing hall, and much larger. Music and dancing styles from the 19th century were depicted, although the story takes place in the 16th century. For example, thumri, a semi-classical music form developed in the 19th century, is adopted in a dance sequence in Kathak style, which is a 16th-century dance form.|$|E
25|$|Zheng Jie {{keeps in}} a small vial pieces of her ankle bone that were removed during the ankle surgery of 2007. She says she keeps {{it because it is}} a part of her, and that it makes her cherish being able to play tennis again and life in general. She <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> it made her world ranking plunge, it also made her grow up a lot.|$|E
25|$|Multiplayer {{gameplay}} {{also makes}} a return in Revelations. The mode expands the basics of online modes from Brotherhood with new characters and locations. Players are able to customize their characters' appearance. Matchmaking and game interface are also improved. Ubisoft <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> this component is returning, the narrative, which is considered {{more important to the}} franchise, is an area of greater focus. As players level up in the multiplayer game, they move up in their Abstergo Templar rank and gain access to more information about the company.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> DHMZ was founded in 1947, the oldest Croatian meteorological station operating continuously was Zagreb-Grič, established in 1861 and DHMZ has such invaluable data in its responsibility.|$|R

25|$|Intense {{communal}} rioting in the Punjab {{forced the}} governments of India and Pakistan {{to agree to a}} forced population exchange of Muslim and Hindu/Sikh minorities living in Punjab. After this population exchange only a few thousand low-caste Hindus remained in Pakistan's side of Punjab and only a tiny Muslim population remained in the town of Malerkotla in India's part of Punjab. Political scientist Ishtiaq Ahmed <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> Muslims started the violence in Punjab, by the end of 1947 more Muslims had been killed by Hindus and Sikhs in East Punjab than the number of Hindus and Sikhs who had been killed by Muslims in West Punjab.|$|E
25|$|Then {{the trio}} of Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who, and Mrs Which arrive. They charge Meg with rescuing Charles Wallace from IT, because only Meg has a strong enough bond with him. Their father had last seen Charles Wallace {{when he was a}} baby and Calvin had only just met him. They each give her a gift. Mrs Whatsit gives Meg her love. Mrs Who quotes to Meg a passage from the Bible about God {{choosing}} the foolish of the world to confound the wise, and the weak to defeat the strong (1st Corinthians 1:27-29). Mrs Which tells Meg that she has one thing that IT does not have. Upon arriving at the building where IT is housed, Charles Wallace is still there under IT's influence. Meg realizes that the one thing she has that IT does not is love. She focuses all her love at Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT's control. Mrs Who, Mrs Which and Mrs Whatsit tesser the Murrys and Calvin back to Earth. In the vegetable garden they are reunited with Mrs. Murry and the twins. Mrs Whatsit <b>says</b> <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> she and the others like the spectacle of the family reuniting, they have to go somewhere. Before Mrs Whatsit finishes her sentence, she and the others disappear.|$|E
25|$|Cyriac Pullapilly {{has noted}} {{a theory that}} the Nambudiris are {{associated}} by some {{with the development of}} the caste system in Kerala, Pullapilly refers to other theories also but of this one he <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st-century AD, there was a large influx of these people from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to local kings and invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their priestly and advisory relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs. The Brahmins treated almost all of those who acceded to their priestly status as Shudra, permitting only a small number to be recognised as Kshatriya, these being some of the local rulers who co-operated with them. By the 11th-century, this combination of association with kings and invaders, and with the destruction or take-over of Buddhist temples, made the Brahmins by far the largest land-owning group in the region and they remained so until very recent times. The origins of Malayalam as a language is also attributed to the Nambudiri Brahamin's mixing of Sanskrit and the local Tamil language. Their dominating influence was to be found in all matters: religion, politics, society, economics and culture.|$|E

500|$|Lichtenstein's {{technique}} {{has been characterized}} by Ernst A. Busche as [...] "the enlargement and unification of his source material... {{on the basis of}} strict artistic principles". Extracted from a larger narrative, the resulting stylized image became in some cases a [...] "virtual abstraction". By recreating their minimalistic graphic techniques, Lichtenstein reinforced the artificial nature of comic strips and advertisements. Lichtenstein's magnification of his source material made his impersonally drawn motifs seem all the more empty. Busche also <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> a critique of modern industrial America may be read into these images, Lichtenstein [...] "would appear to accept the environment as revealed by his reference material as part of American capitalist industrial culture".|$|E
500|$|Mahone {{is not a}} {{straightforward}} character, and his past is revealed as the series progresses. According to series creator Paul Scheuring, the writers try to let all {{the characters in the}} show [...] "inhabit a gray area." [...] Scheuring <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> Mahone's pursuit in the second season is very noble, [...] "there are some things about him that we will learn that are slightly less than noble." [...] Fichtner tries to play the character with a soft side, and believes that those characterizing him as [...] "a hard guy" [...] are [...] "missing what I'm trying to do." [...] Regarding the frequent intake of pills by Mahone, the series' executive producer and writer Matt Olmstead says: ...|$|E
500|$|Critics gave The Heart of a Woman {{positive}} reviews, praising its professional qualities. The American Library Association's [...] magazine <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> Caged Bird was {{the best}} of Angelou's autobiographies, [...] "every book since has been very much worth the reading and pondering". Janet B. Blundell writes that the book was [...] "lively, revealing, and worth the reading", but also found it [...] "too chatty and anecdotal". Hagen responded to this criticism by stating that all of Angelou's books consist of episodes connected by theme and character. Sheree Crute, writing for Ms., appreciated the episodic nature of Angelou's writing and praised her for her [...] "wonderfully unaffected story telling skills". Cudjoe called it [...] "the most political segment of Angelou's autobiographical statement".|$|E

500|$|The comic {{also reveals}} that Marten had {{poisoned}} Roland's infant brother. Furth introduced {{the idea that}} the Bends o' the Rainbow, 13 magic spheres created by Maerlyn in the distant past, are sentient beings able to project personifications which can interact with other characters. Marten has a sexual relationship with the female personification of Maerlyn's Grapefruit, one of the spheres. This is described as incestuous, since the beings were given life by Maerlyn, Walter's biological father; Marten and the Grapefruit repeatedly call each other as brother and sister. The siblings also refer to the Crimson King as their [...] "cousin", indicating that Maerlyn is related to him. In her afterword, Furth <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> she conceived these ideas, King approved them.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers {{compared}} {{the film to}} those of director John Waters but felt that it fell short of the mark. Stephanie Zacharek called it a [...] "Waters knockoff" [...] while Ebert said that Waters might have been ruder and more polished. Babbit <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> Waters {{is one of her}} influences, she did not want her film to have the [...] "bite" [...] of his. She states that whereas John Waters does not like romantic comedies, she wanted to tell a conventionally romantic story. The production design, which was important to the overall look and feel of the film, drew mixed responses. LaSalle described it as clever and eyecatching and James Berardinelli called it a standout feature. Others found it to be gaudy, dated, cartoonish and ghastly.|$|E
5000|$|Algis Budrys {{gave the}} novel a mixed review, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> [...] "there {{is no denying}} {{the power of this}} kind of storytelling, for all that logical {{analysis}} yields some stuff that can sound either ludicrous or gamy." ...|$|R
25|$|He {{went on to}} <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> he {{honors the}} movement, he feels that the efforts serve more to {{enlighten}} the slave-owners than the slaves, making them more watchful and {{making it more difficult}} for future slaves to escape.|$|R
50|$|James Bovard {{comments}} on the US Food for Peace program <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> it sometimes alleviates hunger in the short run, it often disrupts local agricultural markets and {{makes it harder for}} poor countries to feedthemselves in the long run.|$|R
500|$|On the CBS sitcom, The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon Cooper {{is a fan}} of Firefly.

In a statement directed at an absent Joshua, Neku <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> he will not forgive him for what he has done, he trusts him. Neku then asks if Joshua will be present at Hachiko as well. Secret reports that can be obtained by completing additional missions after beating the game reveal that Joshua, after seeing the change in personality of Neku over the weeks of playing the game, decides to spare Shibuya, now believing the city to be ideal. The game ends with Neku abandoning his headphones, before a title card appears entitled [...] "The World Begins with You".|$|E
500|$|Littlebear {{believes}} the book {{helps explain the}} historical origins of the modern attitudes of the Northern Cheyenne towards other tribes. [...] For instance, the Crow are traditionally enemies of the Cheyenne and the Sioux are traditionally allies. [...] Littlebear <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> he knew of these prejudices, {{he did not understand}} the underlying reasons until he read this book. [...] Ted Rising Sun's humorous claim that the alliance with the Sioux was only because the Cheyenne [...] "needed someone to hold the horses" [...] only emphasises their friendship. [...] This claim, repeated by others, possibly originated because after the Sioux's migration into the Black Hills region, they obtained their first horses from the Cheyenne. [...] Ted Rising Sun is a descendant of Chief Dull Knife, a major figure in Cheyenne history and a contemporary of Wooden Leg.|$|E
