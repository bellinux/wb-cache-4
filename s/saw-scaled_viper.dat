25|$|On the Indian subcontinent, {{almost all}} snakebite deaths have {{traditionally}} been attributed to the Big Four, consisting of the Russell's viper, Indian cobra, <b>saw-scaled</b> <b>viper,</b> and the common krait. However, {{studies have shown that}} the hump-nosed viper, previously considered essentially harmless and misidentified as the <b>saw-scaled</b> <b>viper,</b> is capable of delivering a fatal bite. In regions of Kerala, India, it may be responsible for nearly 10% of venomous bites. Commonly used antivenoms in India do not appear to be effective against hump-nosed viper bites. According to the most conservative estimates, at least 81,000 snake envenomings and 11,000 fatalities occur in India each year, making it the most heavily affected country in the world. The Malayan pit viper and banded krait are two other species involved in a significant number of venomous bites.|$|E

50|$|Although Africa {{is home to}} four venomous snake families—Atractaspididae, Colubridae, Elapidae, and Viperidae—approximately 60% of all bites {{are caused}} by vipers alone. In drier regions of the continent, such as sahels and savannas, the <b>saw-scaled</b> <b>vipers</b> inflict up to 90% of all bites. The puff adder is {{responsible}} for the most fatalities overall, although <b>saw-scaled</b> <b>vipers</b> inflict more bites in North African countries, where the puff adder is typically not found. The black mamba, although responsible for far fewer snakebite incidents, is the species which has the highest mortality rate in Africa and in the world.|$|R
50|$|<b>Saw-scaled</b> <b>vipers</b> are {{relatively}} small snakes, the largest species (E. leucogaster, E. pyramidum) staying slightly below 90 cm in total length (body + tail), and the smallest (E. hughesi, E. jogeri) being around 30 cm in total length.|$|R
25|$|In India, the serum {{prepared}} with the venom of monocled cobra Naja kaouthia {{has been found}} to be without effect on the venom of two species of kraits (Bungarus), Russell's viper (Daboia russelli), <b>saw-scaled</b> <b>viper</b> (Echis carinatus), and Pope's pit viper (Trimeresurus popeorum). Russell's viper serum is without effect on colubrine venoms, or those of Echis and Trimeresurus.|$|E
25|$|There {{are roughly}} 235 species of reptiles. Of these, almost half {{live in the}} {{northern}} areas. Reptiles endemic to Somalia include the Hughes' <b>saw-scaled</b> <b>viper,</b> the Southern Somali garter snake, a racer (Platyceps messanai), a diadem snake (Spalerosophis josephscorteccii), the Somali sand boa, the angled worm lizard (Agamodon anguliceps), a spiny-tailed lizard (Uromastyx macfadyeni), Lanza's agama, a gecko (Hemidactylus granchii), the Somali semaphore gecko, and a sand lizard (Mesalina or Eremias). A colubrid snake (Aprosdoketophis andreonei) and Haacke-Greer's skink (Haackgreerius miopus) are endemic species.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are around 100 African bush elephant left in Eritrea, the most northerly of East Africa's elephants. The endangered African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) was previously found in Eritrea, but is now deemed extirpated from the entire country. In Gash-Barka, deadly snakes like <b>saw-scaled</b> <b>viper</b> are common. Puff adder and red spitting cobra are widespread {{and can be found}} even in the highlands. In the coastal areas marine species that are common include dolphin, dugong, whale shark, turtles, marlin, swordfish, and manta ray.|$|E
50|$|In {{the scrub}} habitat of western Rajasthan, they live largely on desert gerbils, but also hunt hares, rats, doves, gray partridges, sandgrouses, peafowl, bulbuls, sparrows and eat eggs of ground birds. They {{have also been}} {{observed}} killing cobras, <b>saw-scale</b> <b>vipers,</b> sand boas, geckos, scorpions and beetles.|$|R
25|$|Most snakebites {{are caused}} by non-venomous snakes. Of the roughly 3,000 known species of snake found worldwide, only 15% are {{considered}} dangerous to humans. The puff adder {{is responsible for the}} most fatalities overall, although <b>saw-scaled</b> <b>vipers</b> inflict more bites in North African countries, where the puff adder is typically not found.

40|$|Introduction: Snake bite is a {{major problem}} in Sri Lanka where recent decades of warfare and {{economic}} sanctions have complicated its management. Results: A retrospective review of snakebites in north-east Sri Lanka was undertaken in 2005 to review management. Of 303 victims, 145 revealed a local response, 134 a prolonged clotting time, 46 ptosis and five respiratory failure. One died. Of 97 snakes identified: 42 were <b>saw-scaled</b> <b>vipers,</b> 14 Russell’s vipers, 6 cobras and 6 kraits. Most bites occurred at the harvest an...|$|R
25|$|Other species {{spotted in}} the {{vicinity}} after restoration include mammals such as grey mongoose and Indian flying fox, reptiles such as common Indian bronzeback and <b>saw-scaled</b> <b>viper,</b> amphibians such as flapshell turtle, Indian painted frog, skipper frog, common Indian toad, green frog (a protected species under schedule 1) and the soft-shelled turtle (also an endangered species), fishes such as Indian shortfin eel, spotted snakehead, and flathead mullet. Around 10 species of mammals, 90 species of birds, 25 species of reptiles and amphibians, 56 species of butterflies, 20 different dragonflies and 30 species of fish have been identified so far.|$|E
25|$|The Viperidae differ much among {{themselves}} in the toxicity of their venom. Some, such as the Indian Russell's viper (Daboia russelli) and <b>saw-scaled</b> <b>viper</b> (Echis carinatus); the American rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.), bushmasters (Lachesis spp.) and lanceheads (Bothrops spp.); and the African adders (Bitis spp.), night adders (Causus spp.), and horned vipers (Cerastes spp.), cause fatal results unless a remedy is speedily applied. The bite of the larger European vipers may be very dangerous, and followed by fatal results, especially in children, {{at least in the}} hotter parts of the Continent; whilst the small meadow viper (Vipera ursinii), which hardly ever bites unless roughly handled, {{does not seem to be}} possessed of a very virulent venom, and, although very common in some parts of Austria and Hungary, is not known to have ever caused a serious accident.|$|E
500|$|During a briefing, {{early in}} the film, an officer states that a SEAL on a {{previous}} mission in the Afghan mountains was bitten by a rattlesnake. As the four-man SEAL team are fighting and withdrawing down a rocky slope, one of them encounters a large rattlesnake which is heard rattling before it is seen on screen. Rattlesnakes are found in almost every mainland country of the Americas, from Canada to Argentina, excluding Panama, Ecuador and Chile, {{but they do not}} occur outside the Americas. The venomous snakes encountered in the rocky valleys of the Pashtun region would be the <b>Saw-scaled</b> <b>viper</b> (Echis carinatus) and [...] the Levant viper (Macrovipera lebetina), with an outside chance of a rare Persian horned viper (Pseudocerastes persicus). The sound of the saw-scale viper rubbing its scales together as a defensive warning is not dissimilar to that made by a small rattlesnake vibrating its tail. It is likely that U.S. troops, upon hearing this sound, would automatically attribute it to the familiar rattlesnake from back home.|$|E
50|$|The {{greater coucal}} {{is a large}} bird which takes {{a wide range of}} insects, {{caterpillars}} and small vertebrates such as the <b>Saw-scaled</b> <b>vipers.</b> They are also known to eat bird eggs, nestlings, fruits and seeds. In Tamil Nadu they were found to feed predominantly on snails Helix vittata. They are also known to feed on the toxic fruits of Cascabela thevetia (Yellow Oleander). In Oil palm cultivation, they have been noted as an avian pest due to their habit of eating the fleshy mesocarps of the ripe fruits.|$|R

5000|$|Echis (common names: <b>saw-scaled</b> <b>vipers,</b> carpet vipers) is a genus of venomous vipers {{found in}} the dry regions of Africa, the Middle East, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka. They have a {{characteristic}} threat display, rubbing sections of their body together to produce a [...] "sizzling" [...] warning sound. The name Echis is the Latin transliteration of the Greek word for [...] "viper" [...] (ἔχις). Their common name is [...] "saw-scaled vipers" [...] and they include some of the species responsible for causing the most snakebite cases and deaths in the world. Eight species are currently recognized.|$|R

50|$|Some {{species of}} venomous snakes stridulate {{as part of}} a threat display. They arrange their body into a series of {{parallel}} C-shaped (counterlooped) coils that they rub together to produce a sizzling sound, rather like water on a hot plate. The best-known examples are members of the genus Echis (<b>saw-scaled</b> <b>vipers),</b> although those of the genus Cerastes (North African desert vipers) and at least one bush viper species, Atheris desaixi, do this as well. A bird species, the club-winged manakin, has a dedicated stridulation apparatus, while a species of mammal, the lowland streaked tenrec, (Hemicentetes semispinosus) produces a high-pitched noise by rubbing together specialised quills on its back.|$|R
40|$|Our {{knowledge}} of animal and human physiological processes owes much to {{over a century}} of study of natural toxins. The neurotoxins of kraits (bungarotoxins from Bungarus spp.) and cobras (Naja spp.) have helped define the acetylcholine receptor and neuromuscular transmission.

40|$|DNA {{vaccination}} induces potent cellular immune responses against infectious and parasitic intracellular pathogens. This paper {{illustrates that}} DNA immunisation protocols {{can be adapted}} to induce high titre antibody responses with potential to improve the treatment of systemic snake envenoming that kills 20, 000 people annually in Africa. Envenoming by the <b>saw-scaled</b> <b>vipers</b> and puff adders are responsible for the majority of these deaths. DNA sequences encoding haemorrhagic, pro- and anti-coagulant and other haemostasis-disruptive venom toxins from these vipers showed extensive cross-specific and cross-generic sequence and structural similarities. The predicted antigenic profiles of these toxin sequences are utilised to design DNA immunisation constructs to generate toxin-specific antibodies with potential to polyspecifically neutralise venoms from the most medically-important African vipers.

40|$|In Kerala, {{south-western}} India, {{five patients}} developed systemic envenoming after bites by hump-nosed pit vipers (Hypnale hypnale), proved by {{identification of the}} snakes responsible. Two of the dead snakes had been misidentified as <b>saw-scaled</b> <b>vipers</b> (Echis carinatus), while three had remained unidentified. Symptoms of local envenoming were pain, swelling, haemorrhagic blistering, bruising and regional lymphadenopathy. Systemic symptoms included headache, nausea, vomiting and abdominal and chest pain. There was evidence of haemostatic dysfunction (coagulopathy, fibrinolysis, thrombocytopenia or spontaneous systemic haemorrhage) in all cases and of microangiopathic haemolysis in two. Two patients were haemodialysed for acute renal failure, one of whom developed pulmonary oedema requiring mechanical ventilation. In India, H. hypnale has not previously been regarded {{as a cause of}} frequent or potentially dangerous envenoming. Its medical importance has been overlooked throughout its geographical range, probably because of confusion with other small species. No specific antivenom exists, yet most patients are treated with non-specific antivenoms, risking reactions without hope of benefit. An effective antivenom is urgently needed in south India and in Sri Lanka, where this species is also a common cause of bites...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{recognized}} viper {{species in the}} Near and Middle East has been raised significantly in the last 25 years (Table 1). While some smaller genera remained more or less stable, the genus Vipera has been subdivided into four genera {{on the basis of}} molecular genetic data.

40|$|Snake envenoming is a {{significant}} cause of mortality and morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa. The only effective treatment, antivenom, has been in short supply since the 1990 s. Whilst the humanitarian response by some antivenom producers has significantly improved the situation, strategies to ensure the long term stability of antivenom supply are still necessary. We are investigating whether the potential safety and logistic advantages of camel IgG antivenom can be exploited to improve antivenom provision in many countries where snakebite is endemic. This study assessed the IgG titre, specificity and avidity of camels immunised with either individual venom or a mixture of venoms from the three most medically important snakes of West Africa, the <b>saw-scale</b> <b>viper</b> (Echis ocellatus), the puff adder (Bitis arietans) and the spitting cobra (Naja nigricollis). Seven of the eight immunised camels generated IgG titres and avidities comparable to, or exceeding, that of commercial equine and ovine antivenoms that are highly effective in envenomed patients. In this, {{the first of a}} series of reports on the potential utility of camelid IgG antivenom, we describe an immunisation protocol that induced potent, sustained serological response of very high antibody avidity. These attributes suggest, from an immunological perspective, that camel IgG antivenoms should be as efficacious as current equine and ovine antivenoms...|$|R
40|$|<b>Saw-scaled</b> <b>vipers</b> (genus Echis) {{are one of}} {{the leading}} causes of snakebite {{morbidity}} and mortality in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and vast regions of Asia, constituting a public health burden exceeding that of almost any other snake genus globally. Venom-induced consumption coagulopathy, owing to the action of potent procoagulant toxins, {{is one of the most}} relevant clinical manifestations of envenomings by Echis spp. Clinical experience and prior studies examining a limited range of venoms and eected antivenoms have demonstrated for some antivenoms an extreme lack of antivenom cross-reactivity between different species of this genus, sometimes resulting in catastrophic treatment failure. This study undertook the most comprehensive testing of Echis venom effects upon the coagulation of human plasma, and also the broadest examination of antivenom potency and cross-reactivity, to-date. 10 Echis species/populations and four antivenoms (two African, two Asian) were studied. The results indicate that the venoms are, in general, potently procoagulant but that the relative dependence on calcium or phospholipid co-factors is highly variable. Additionally, three out of the four antivenoms tested demonstrated only a very narrow taxonomic range of effectiveness in preventing coagulopathy, with only the SAIMR antivenom displaying significant levels of cross-reactivity. These results were in conflict with previous studies using prolonged preincubation of antivenom with venom to suggest effective cross-reactivity levels for the ICP Echi-Tab antivenom. These findings both inform upon potential clinical effects of envenomation in humans and highlight the extreme limitations of available treatment. It is hoped that this will spur efforts into the development of antivenoms with more comprehensive coverage for bites not only from wild snakes but also from specimens widely kept in zoological collections...|$|R
