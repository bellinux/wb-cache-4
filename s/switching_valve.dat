5000|$|Each HPU on an SRB was {{connected}} to both servoactuators on that SRB. One HPU served as the primary hydraulic source for the servoactuator, and the other HPU served as the secondary hydraulics for the servoactuator. Each servoactuator had a <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> that allowed the secondary hydraulics to power the actuator if the primary hydraulic pressure dropped below [...] A switch contact on the <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> closed when the valve was in the secondary position. When the valve was closed, a signal {{was sent to the}} APU controller, that inhibited the 100% APU speed control logic and enabled the 112% APU speed control logic. The 100-percent APU speed enabled one APU/HPU to supply sufficient operating hydraulic pressure to both servoactuators of that SRB.|$|E
5000|$|Gas source inlet or gas {{switching}} valve; gaseous {{samples in}} collection bottles {{are connected to}} what is most commonly a six-port <b>switching</b> <b>valve.</b> The carrier gas flow is not interrupted while a sample can be expanded into a previously evacuated sample loop. Upon switching, {{the contents of the}} sample loop are inserted into the carrier gas stream.|$|E
30|$|To mimic frog {{swimming}} performance, a frog inspired swimming robot {{is developed}} with pneumatic muscles and high-speed <b>switch</b> <b>valves</b> to study pneumatic characteristics during leg extension.|$|R
30|$|A micro {{air pump}} {{is placed in}} the rear trunk. Meanwhile, given the size of the air pump, we make it pass through the baffle plate {{connected}} to the cooling fin of the pump. The source chamber is connected to the outlet of the pump and filled with high-pressure compressed air. The high-speed <b>switch</b> <b>valves</b> are mounted {{in the middle of the}} baffle plate on the bottom face. The electrical unit is located in the front head of the exhaust chamber, which is also connected to the inlet of the pump. Therefore, the <b>switch</b> <b>valve</b> controls the flow from the source chamber to the muscle for pressurizing and from the muscle to the exhaust chamber for depressurizing.|$|R
50|$|The Prius v also {{includes}} a redesigned engine coolant heating structure surrounding the vehicle’s catalytic converter and the exhaust heat recirculation system has been refined to reduce engine warm-up time and improve occupant heater response time in cold weather. A <b>switch</b> <b>valve</b> electronically controls coolant recirculation through the exhaust heat recirculation system.|$|R
5000|$|H2S. Very {{small amounts}} of H2S, SF6, and {{probably}} any other sulfur containing gases, cause immediate and complete deactivation of the catalyst. It {{is not possible to}} regenerate a poisoned catalyst that has been deactivated by sulfur, by treating with either oxygen or hydrogen. If sulfur containing gases are present in the sample, a <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> should be used either to bypass the catalyst, or to back-flush the column to vent after elution of CO2.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} inlet type and {{injection}} technique depends on if {{the sample is}} in liquid, gas, adsorbed, or solid form, and on whether a solvent matrix is present {{that has to be}} vaporized. Dissolved samples can be introduced directly onto the column via a COC injector, if the conditions are well known; if a solvent matrix has to be vaporized and partially removed, a S/SL injector is used (most common injection technique); gaseous samples (e.g., air cylinders) are usually injected using a gas <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> system; adsorbed samples (e.g., on adsorbent tubes) are introduced using either an external (on-line or off-line) desorption apparatus such as a purge-and-trap system, or are desorbed in the injector (SPME applications).|$|E
50|$|The {{engine control}} unit (ECU) {{controls}} the position {{of one or more}} air control valves based on input signals from throttle angle and engine RPM. The vacuum <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> (VSV) which controls the vacuum supply to the actuator is normally closed and passes vacuum to the actuator when it is energized by the ECU. By energizing the VSV vacuum is passed to the actuator, closing the air control valve. This effectively lengthens the intake manifold run. By de-energizing the VSV, vacuum to the actuator is blocked and trapped vacuum is bled off of the actuator diaphragm. Toyota ACIS is an On/Off system. The valve (or valves in newer models with multiple valves to create more than 2 lengths) is either fully opened or fully closed.An example of early single-valve ACIS programming would be the 3.0L 3VZ-FE engine. The ECU actuates the VSV to close the valve when the throttle position is 60% or greater and engine speed is 3,900 RPM or more.|$|E
50|$|Utility tunnels carry {{everything}} from drinking water to power to fiber-optic network cabling. Some roofs have high power radio broadcast or radio reception equipment and weather-surveillance equipment, damage to {{which can be}} costly. Roofs and tunnels also may contain <b>switches,</b> <b>valves,</b> and controls for utility systems that were not designed to be accessible to the general public.|$|R
30|$|Traditional drivers, such as motors, {{run through}} complex {{mechanisms}} [17]. Meanwhile pneumatic muscles {{have been widely}} used because of its simple assembly [18] and are mainly controlled by tracking control methods [19 – 21]. Several studies have performed on pneumatic muscles, mainly focusing on the modeling and control of pneumatic valves [22 – 24]. The precise pressure proportional valve is typically used to achieve output accuracy, but the cost is expensive and the flow rate of the pressure proportional valve is relatively small. Further, such setup is not suited for situations demanding large flow inputs. In this paper, pneumatic muscles are controlled by high-speed <b>switch</b> <b>valves,</b> which have high flow rate and fast response, thereby simplifying the design of the frog-inspired robot. In addition, high-speed <b>switch</b> <b>valves</b> are light weight, occupy small volume, and incur low cost, and is thus preferable in the robot system.|$|R
30|$|For protein purification, 15 % (w/v) cell {{suspensions}} in 50 [*]mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 [*]mM NaCl {{were prepared}} and disrupted by sonification. The crude extracts were centrifuged (8, 000 x g, 5 [*]min, 4 °C), {{and the resultant}} supernatants were passed through 0.45 [*]μm filters. Purification and desalting were performed using an automated Bioline system (Knauer). The system was equipped with a pump (S 1000), DAD (S 2850), conductivity meter (S 2900) and a 6 -port/ 3 -channel manual injection valve. Chromatography columns were connected to the system via two 7 -port/ 1 -channel <b>switching</b> <b>valves</b> (see Additional file 1). Peak parking was accomplished with two 6 -port/ 3 -channel <b>switching</b> <b>valves</b> (see Additional file 1). Eluted proteins were collected with a fraction collector (Frac 3050). The fraction collector was cooled using a thermostat (Ministat 230, Huber, Germany) at 4 °C. The Bioline chromatography system was controlled by the ChromGate Data System V. 3.3. 2.|$|R
40|$|Two {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatograph}} (HPLC) systems with a Rheodyne Model 7000 <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> {{for separation of}} D- and L-lactate in biological samples has been reported. However, since the <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> was rotated manually, so that only 10 samples could be determined within one day. For better efficiency, a circuit for rotating the <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> automatically, which is including mechanical units of motion, two timers, and electronic control units was designed. Total (D+L) -lactate fluorescent derivatives was separated from others by a TSKgel ODS- 80 Ts column, when the peak of lactate derivatives appeared in the chromatogram on the ODS column, the valve position was changed by switching and then the isolated lactate derivatives was introduced into the chiral column automatically. Then the D- and L- enantiomers were separated by the chiral column. The utility of the analyzer system was tested for the determination of chiral separation of urinary D, L-lactate in the mouse. It takes about 90 min to analyze one urine sample for a circulation. Before automation, we must turn the <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> manually when the signal shows up, so {{that there must be}} someone always standby and only about 10 samples could be analyzed within one day. With the designed automatic column-switching HPLC system, the <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> can be automatically turned at the setting time repeatedly and over 15 samples could be determined within one day. The automatic system makes the analysis of D-lactate be time-saving, convenient and reproducible...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{how to use}} fast-switching valves in close-loop pressure and position control loop. Many valves have been analysed to choose the best. Pulse width modulation showed best behaviour among analysed modulation types. Close {{loop control of position}} and pressure is precisely described and connections between parameters (e. g. pulse frequency, sampling time) and properties of analysed actuators (e. g. precision, bode diagram) are presented. Life-time analysis and reduction of noise level were also important working points. Finally, a digitally controlled steering mechanism for cars has been developed. Aim was to extend digital signal circuit in combination with using cheap <b>switching</b> <b>valves.</b> Good precision can be reached, but noise production remains a problem. Actuators using fast <b>switching</b> <b>valves</b> will be good for noise-insensitive applications with low demands in frequency responseSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1269 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
50|$|Safety {{equipment}} manufacturers provide {{a range of}} isolation devices specifically designed to fit various <b>switches,</b> <b>valves</b> and effectors. For example, most circuit-breakers have a provision to have a small padlock attached to prevent their activation. For other devices such as ball or gate valves, plastic pieces which either fit against the pipe and prevent movement, or clam-shell style objects, which completely surround the valve and prevent its manipulation are used.|$|R
30|$|The {{swimming}} {{cycle is}} divided into the propulsive and recovery phases according to body velocity. The leg motions are powerful and rapid in the propulsive phase, while the legs recover slowly during the recovery phase. Therefore, the experiments and simulations on the hind leg extensions were conducted to test the muscle capacity to drive the system. The pressures in the pneumatic muscles were controlled by the high-speed <b>switch</b> <b>valves</b> with open loop control.|$|R

40|$|Nanoliter {{flow rate}} is optimum for {{separation}} in capillary column liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (mu HPLC-MS/MS). In {{order to develop}} a high-performance automated proteome analysis system allowing direct injection sample containing detergents, the influence of void volume varied from 0 to 5 mu L on the separation performance and proteomic coverage of sample injection system using strong cation-exchange (SCX) trap column was investigated, it was found the void volume hardly affects the separation performance by using SCX trap column. Thus, a fully automated sample injection system using SCX trap column and ten-port <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> was established for efficient shotgun proteome analysis. In this system, a nanoflow <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> and a microtee were used to connect the SCX trap and analytical columns, and the uncleaned samples of proteolytic digests containing contaminants could be directly injected with minor influence on the separation performance, which was demonstrated to be a useful strategy in proteome analysis.

Mitsubishi developed the world’s first production semi-active electronically controlled suspension system in passenger cars; the system was first incorporated in the 1987 Galant model. Delphi currently sells shock absorbers filled with a magneto-rheological fluid, whose viscosity can be changed electromagnetically, thereby giving variable control without <b>switching</b> <b>valves,</b> which is faster and thus more effective.|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} a new {{interface}} for comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC × LC) is described. To the conventionally used LC × LC system with the loop-type interface consisting of a two-position/ten-port <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> equipped with two loops, an extra two-position/ten-port <b>switching</b> <b>valve,</b> a detector, a pump and a second column placed in parallel with the column in the second dimension, are added. The features of the interface are that the separation space in the second dimension is significantly enlarged and {{that the number of}} fractions transferred from the first to the second dimension can be increased, reducing the risk to lose resolution of the primary dimension. The potential of the system in NPLC × 2 RPLC is illustrated with the analysis of a standard mixture and a lemon oil extract. For the lemon oil analysis, the effective peak capacity was increased from 437 using a conventional interface to 1095 with the new interface.

30|$|The three {{revolute}} joints of each {{hind leg}} use six pneumatic muscles in total, and each pneumatic muscle {{is controlled by}} two high-speed <b>switch</b> <b>valves.</b> Thus, the entire hind limb requires 12 pneumatic high-speed <b>switch</b> <b>valves.</b> We consider the hip joint as an example to explain the working principle of the pneumatic circuit. The body and the thigh crank are connected with a joint shaft. Each end of the crank is hinged to the muscles, and the other ends {{are connected to the}} body frame. During muscle contraction and stretching, the crank (fixed with the thigh frame) rotates relative to the body. To reach the initial position, the charging valve 1 and discharging valve 2 are open, and the discharging valve 1 and charging valve 2 are closed. The recovery muscle then starts to contract, and the driving muscle stretches until the joint rotates clockwise to the preset position (Figure  6). During the propulsive phase, the hip joint must rotate counterclockwise quickly, and thus the charging valve 1 and discharging valve 2 are close, and charging valve 1 and the discharging valve 2 are open. The recovery muscle of the hip joint then starts to stretch and the driving muscle contracts. The hip joint rotates counterclockwise quickly to a specific position.|$|R

40|$|A HPLC-UV/Vis method using a two-column {{strategy}} with a <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> for on-line sample cleanup {{was developed for}} the determination of cyanocobalamin (CN–Cbl/Vitamin B 12) in multivitamin dietary supplement tablets. The method uses two columns: an Agilent Zorbax C 8 (150 mm 4. 6 mm, 5 mm particle size) reversed-phase column and a Waters Symmetry C 18 (150 mm 4. 6 mm, 5 mm particle size) reversed-phase column. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a programmed gradient mobile phase consisting of (A) 0. 1 % formic acid in water and (B) 0. 1 % formic acid in acetonitrile. Because of the low levels of Vitamin B 12 in the samples, large injection volumes, and thus much interfering material, must be used to exceed the limit of quantitation (LOQ) by UV detection. A <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> was used to divert most of these early eluting interfering materials to waste, effecting on-line sample clean-up without excessive sample preparation steps. The recovery of CN–Cbl in the method was 99. 5 % and the LOQ was 10 ng per injection. The method was successfully applied {{to the analysis of}} the NIST SRM 3280 multivitamin/multimineral dietary supplement tablet. The method is specific, precise, and accurate for the intended use.
