Partial success, provided that there is some measure of preservation to the owners, is sufficient. The Tojo Maru (1972 AC 242 HL) examined certain characteristics of salvage contracts and concluded that the primary consideration is that the person rendering the <b>salvage</b> <b>service</b> is not entitled to any remuneration unless he saves the property in whole or in part.|$|E

50|$|Authorized {{abandonment}} {{refers to}} a condition wherein, at the time the Master decided to abandon ship, there was no hope or intention of returning to the stricken ship. There can be no suggestion that a mere temporary abandonment would dissolve the crew's contract of employment. The case of the Albionic (1941 70 L1.L.Rep.257) ruled that there was no express order given by the Master to abandon the ship, and therefore the crew's contracts of service were not terminated at the time when they performed the <b>salvage</b> <b>service.</b> The San Demetrio (1941 69 L1.L.Rep.5) case demonstrated a good example of an authorized abandonment of ship under the Master's authority. If the ship was properly abandoned under the orders from the master, the vessel's own crews who saved the vessel or cargo on board were entitled to claim salvage.|$|E

50|$|It is {{incumbent}} upon {{the court to}} assess the existence and level of danger, both present and future. The case of the Troilus (1951 1 Lloyd's Rep. 467, HL) illustrated the concept of future danger that the court {{must take into account}} when determining the existence of danger. In this particular case, the cargo owners contended that the ship was in perfect safety when she reached Aden, and therefore it constituted ocean towage but not salvage when towing from Aden to UK. The court held that even though the ship and cargo was in physical safety, the services rendered still amounted to <b>salvage</b> <b>service</b> {{on the grounds that the}} master of a damaged ship must do his best to preserve the ship and cargo and bring them to their destination as cheaply and efficiently as possible. The salvage award was reasonable as long as the master acts reasonably for the combined benefit of ship and cargo.|$|E

40|$|Under U. S. {{maritime}} law, a salvor of imperiled {{maritime property}} on navigable waters {{is entitled to}} a monetary award from the owner. When the <b>salvage</b> <b>service</b> is rendered voluntarily {{in the absence of}} a contract, the court determines the salvage award according to six factors enumerated by the Supreme Court in The Blackwall, 77 U. S. 1 (1869). The law, however, does not specify a precise formula or rule for calculating awards on the basis of the Blackwall factors. How do courts turn their findings on the Blackwall factors into salvage awards? This article addresses this question by examining the reported decisions of U. S. courts in salvage cases from 1799 to 2007. It employs two statistical methods—fractional polynomial regression and regression tree analysis—to make inferences about the mapping from factors to awards implicit in the salvage cases. In addition to presenting the first systematic empirical study of U. S. marine salvage awards, which complements the traditional doctrinal analysis offered by maritime commentators, an important contribution of the article is that it showcases statistical methods that are well suited to empirical doctrinal analysis but are underutilized in legal scholarship...|$|E

40|$|Background: Diabetic wounds with {{additional}} comorbidities are costly, time intensive, {{and difficult to}} heal. Often, multiple modalities {{may be necessary to}} achieve wound resolution, relying on the synergistic advantage of each therapy to affect wound healing. The selectivity of Clostridium collagenase is physiologically effective at degrading non-viable collagen fibers while preserving living collagen tissue. Additionally, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has long been used to aid wound healing while concurrently depreciating biological wound burden time. Methods: Six patients were selected from those appearing to our university based limb <b>salvage</b> <b>service.</b> Inclusion criteria included patients with a recurrent mixed fibrotic and granular wound base, in which NPWT was indicated, without exclusion criteria. Patients enrolled were administered clostridial collagenase ointment at each regularly scheduled NPWT dressing change. Patients were followed until healing, with visual representations of wound progression and time to full healing recorded. Results: Tandem application of these therapies appeared to expedite wound healing by clearing degenerative fibrous tissue and expediting wound granulation without additional complication. Unfortunately, not all patients were able to reach full healing; with two patients experiencing ulcer recurrence, likely a result of their significant comorbid nature. Conclusion: In our experience, we have noticed a specific subgroup of patients who benefit greatly when collagenase enzymatic debridement therapy is combined with NPWT. It is our belief that this combination therapy combines the molecular clearing of non-viable collagen with the wound granulation necessary to advance complex wounds to the next step in healing despite the current paucity in literature discussing this specific pairing...|$|E
40|$|In 2012 106 vessels over 100 gross tonnes were lost. During {{the damage}} {{incidents}} {{many of these}} vessels required assistance from shore based emergency response services with regards to their damaged strength to stabilise the situation, preserve life, prevent environmental disaster and limit financial costs to owners and insurers. The research work presented in this Engineering Doctorate Thesis surrounds the strength assessment of damaged steel ship structures, the influence of damage {{on the strength of}} steel-plated structures and methods for assessing the residual strength of a vessel in an emergency. The focus of the work is to improve the modelling of damaged steel ship structures within an emergency situation, in order to improve guidance provided to a stricken vessel during a damage incident or salvage process. Literature study has shown that structural idealisation through the use of interframe progressive collapse analysis, to be {{the current state of the}} art method for the rapid assessment of intact and damaged ship structures. However, a number of weaknesses have been identified in the method when applied to damage assessment. The literature study has also shown a lack of understanding of the effect of damage on steel-plated structures as specific analysis has not been performed previously. Significant research has been undertaken into the influence of damage, in the form of a hole, on the ultimate collapse strength of steel-plated structures. Three levels of structural modelling have been used, stiffened-plate, stiffened panel and grillage. Comparison of the predicted ultimate collapse strength by finite element analysis (FEA) with predictions using the interframe progressive collapse idealisation, has shown the calculated results to be conservative for the assessment of damaged structure when the failure mode remains in the interframe collapse form. However, changes in the failure mode lead to the interframe progressive collapse method over predicting the ultimate collapse strength. The analysis shows that even small damage events can lead to significant changes to the failure mode and resulting ultimate collapse strength of the structure. Such influences must be accounted for in any simplified method. A new method for the assessment of damaged ship structures is proposed that is capable of modelling a damage scenario more accurately. Demonstration of the method has shown the results to be less conservative than the current state of the art, when compared to FEA, for local analysis of damaged steel-plated structure. The ability of the method to account for the influence of damage, and the resulting failure modes, that may significantly influence the ultimate bending strength of the structure has also been demonstrated. The method implements a compartment level progressive collapse analysis with structural data captured through the use of the response surface method ‘kriging’, using data points provided from FEA. This method allows the critical damage variables to be captured and strength data accessible quickly for use in the analysis. The time to provide a solution to the damage scenario is equivalent to the existing interframe progressive collapse method. Therefore, the method is suitable for application within an emergency response or <b>salvage</b> <b>service...</b>|$|E
