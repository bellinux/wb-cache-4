50|$|Fraile's {{early work}} can be {{described}} as a form of cubism, which trended towards greater abstraction, and even primitivism, as his career progressed. In his later work he tended to minimize his subjects, isolating them in space, and working with broad swatches of bright colors, strong line and energetic brush work. He often explored a composition multiple times, often serially on a <b>single</b> <b>canvas,</b> at other times on several canvasses, in varying palettes.|$|R
50|$|Anamorph is a 2007 {{independent}} psychological thriller film {{directed by}} Henry S. Miller and starring Willem Dafoe. Dafoe plays a seasoned detective named Stan Aubray, who notices that a case {{he has been}} assigned to bears a striking similarity to a previous case of his. The film {{is based on the}} concept of anamorphosis, a painting technique that manipulates the laws of perspective to create two competing images on a <b>single</b> <b>canvas.</b>|$|R

Baldessari then names only one of his two artistic “collaborators” on each canvas’s lower edge, such as …AND MANET or …AND DUCHAMP.|$|R
50|$|From 1830 to 1832, Morse {{traveled}} {{and studied}} in Europe {{to improve his}} painting skills, visiting Italy, Switzerland, and France. During his time in Paris, he developed a friendship with the writer James Fennimore Cooper. As a project, he painted miniature copies of 38 of the Louvre's famous paintings on a <b>single</b> <b>canvas</b> (6 ft. x 9 ft), which he entitled The Gallery of the Louvre. He completed the work upon {{his return to the}} United States.|$|R
50|$|Donegan's {{most famous}} painting, Papa Tjukurpa munu Pukara, {{combined}} {{both of these}} stories onto a <b>single</b> <b>canvas.</b> It is a composition of several different styles and techniques, and won the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award in August 2010. It was given the award for best painting, and was then chosen for the overall prize from the winners {{of each of the}} five categories. It was the first time Donegan had entered his artwork into a competition.|$|R
50|$|As a {{fine art}} major, he studied with Richard Lindner while earning his B.F.A. from Pratt and his M.F.A. from Columbia University. His mastery of {{painting}} is easily {{seen in his}} brilliant portraiture. Bernstein's incredible affinity with the human face has led to works that are both figurative and iconic, reflecting both an era and culture. His incorporation of several mediums on a <b>single</b> <b>canvas</b> shows the interrelation of elements {{he saw in the}} world around him.|$|R

The first version, a <b>single</b> <b>canvas</b> (now at the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Grenoble), was immediately replaced by a second version on three slate panels that permits the actual miraculous holy image of the [...] "Santa Maria in Vallicella" [...] to be revealed on important feast days by a removable copper cover, also painted by the artist.|$|R
50|$|Pearce {{began to}} use brushes on canvas rather than pens and paper which gave him the {{opportunity}} to work considerably larger than previously. He has developed a technique which involves the throwing of paint onto raw canvas, to create the start of his paintings. He then stretches the canvas onto frames/stretchers which he has designed specially to take the force of stretching the canvas, which doesn't involve any cross-bracing. His largest <b>single</b> <b>canvas</b> to date measures 5 ft by 9 ft.|$|R

50|$|His {{style is}} close to the late Mannerism of Frans Francken the Younger and A. W. Forchondt. Many of his works have a {{narrative}} character and recount stories of the Old and the New Testament. As is also common in the work of Francken, his compositions often include different sequences of the principal story in a <b>single</b> <b>canvas.</b> His work is characterized primarily by the quality of the drawing, as well as the large space occupied by the figures in the composition. Another feature of his style is the preference for white modeling, around which the shadows are traced.|$|R

50|$|Leonardo da Vinci {{had also}} {{realized}} that objects at different distances from the eyes project images in the two eyes that differ in their horizontal positions, but had concluded only that this {{made it impossible for}} a painter to portray a realistic depiction of the depth in a scene from a <b>single</b> <b>canvas.</b> Leonardo chose for his near object a column with a circular cross section and for his far object a flat wall. Had he chosen any other near object, he might have discovered horizontal disparity of its features.

5000|$|In 1990, Lees {{moved to}} Leeds, New York. Lees and his wife, Ruth, {{who is also}} a painter, have {{maintained}} their studio and home there since that time. One of the unusual characteristics of Lees' paintings is his tendency to work on a <b>single</b> <b>canvas</b> for as long as 30 years. Following his 2003 show, Cate McQuaid wrote in the Boston Globe:"John Lees has paintings of his wife, Ruth, that he has been working on since the '70s.

5000|$|His {{paintings}} can {{be found}} in a number of collections including the National Gallery of Greece, the Greek Ministry of Culture, the Vorres Museum, the Presidential Palace of Cyprus and other public and private collections in Cyprus, Greece and beyond. Notable among the work completed prior to his death is his collaboration with the artist Stass Paraskos. Working on a <b>single</b> <b>canvas</b> but maintaining their respective styles, these paintings are known as the ‘pomishiarika’ (Cypriot dialect for ‘jointly owned’), although the art historian Michael Paraskos has described them as essentially anarchist paintings in which the 'dictatorship' of the single artist over the canvas is replaced by a democratic space. [...] Some of these joint works were put on display in Nicosia 2007, in an exhibition inaugurated by the British art historian Norbert Lynton.|$|R

50|$|Culwell’s {{interest}} in texture {{led him to}} experiment radically with material properties—often he combined oil paint, commercial oil enamel, and Duco on a <b>single</b> <b>canvas.</b> Duco and oil paint are not wholly compatible, which frequently led to the curdling and wrinkling of the paint surface—an effect that pleased Culwell, who took this property to extremes in the 1950-54 Roof series. Completed while Culwell lived in San Antonio, Texas, the Roof series consists of paintings that Culwell set to dry {{on the roof of}} his home. He found, during his experiments with Duco, that the paint emits noxious fumes while drying, which led him to place the paintings on the roof. This exposed the work to the sun and other elements, which allowed the dense accretion characteristic of earlier works but did not take the amount of intense labor and time.|$|R
5000|$|The four hectare {{property}} that encompasses Wigandia, {{has been said}} to have begun life as 'nothing but a horse paddock, heavily grazed and aching with weeds'. Martin has variously described his garden as 'a series of sketches, but (also) a single canvas' [...] and elsewhere, 'a <b>single</b> <b>canvas</b> with every area interlinked'. He has also attested to his interest in geographic references by stating that a primary concern was to 'ensure the garden harmonises with the surrounding landscape of Mount Noorat'. It could be argued this forms a key foundation in the colour selection at Wigandia where the paths and interspaces feature crushed red volcanic scoria sourced from southwest Victoria. In a gesture to cultural references, the frequent use of corrugated iron, a key feature of construction in rural Australia, {{is used in the}} garden as a barrier material for fencing and other installations.|$|R

50|$|In {{eighteenth-century}} New Spain, Mexican artists {{along with}} a few Spanish artists produced paintings of a system of racial hierarchy, known as casta paintings. It was almost exclusively a Mexican form however, one set was produced in Peru. In a break from religious paintings of the preceding centuries, casta paintings were a secular art form. Only one known casta painting by a relatively unknown painter, Luis de Mena, combines castas with Mexico's Virgin of Guadalupe; this being an exception. Some of Mexico's most distinguished artists painted casta works, including Miguel Cabrera. Most casta paintings were on multiple canvases, with one family grouping on each. There were a handful of <b>single</b> <b>canvas</b> paintings, showing the entire racial hierarchy. The paintings show idealized family groupings, with the father being of one racial, the mother of another racial category, and their offspring being a third racial category. This genre of painting flourished for about a century, coming to an end with Mexican independence in 1821, and the abolition of legal racial categories.|$|R
5|$|Irving Blum {{made the}} {{original}} thirty-two canvases {{available to the}} public through an arrangement with the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC by placing them on permanent loan two days before Warhol's death. However, the original Campbell's Soup Cans is now a part of the Museum of Modern Art permanent collection. A print called Campbell's Soup Cans II is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. 200 Campbell's Soup Cans, 1962 (Acrylic on canvas, 72inches x 100inches), in the private collection of John and Kimiko Powers is the largest <b>single</b> <b>canvas</b> of the Campbell's Soup can paintings. It is composed of ten rows and twenty columns of numerous flavors of soups. Experts point to it {{as one of the most}} significant works of pop art both as a pop representation and as conjunction with immediate predecessors such as Jasper Johns and the successors movements of Minimal and Conceptual art. The very similar 100 Cans from the Albright-Knox Art Gallery collection is shown above. The earliest soup can painting seems to be Campbell's Soup Can (Tomato Rice), a 1960 ink, tempera, crayon, and oil canvas.|$|R
30|$|The {{maintenance}} of applications {{is a crucial}} activity in the software industry. The high cost {{of this process is}} due to the effort invested on software comprehension since, in most of cases, there is no up-to-date abstraction or documentation to ease this task but the source code. The goal of many commercial and academic tools is to build software architectural views from the code. The main disadvantages of such tools are: i) they are dependent on the language/technology on top of which the application is built; and ii) they offer pre-defined views that are too difficult to adapt to meet particular software comprehension needs. In this paper, we present a Technology-independent approach which is flexible enough to allow developers to define metric-centered architectural views by using annotations. These views display in a <b>single</b> <b>canvas</b> architectural elements whose look and feel maps software metrics. Our work results from joint projects with industry partners with software modernization needs in different technologies: Oracle Forms, Java EE, and Ruby on Rails. We present how our proposal was applied in these projects and compare the results with those of the previously followed process.|$|R
