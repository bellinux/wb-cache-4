50|$|Pipe dope is any thread lubricant, thread <b>sealing</b> <b>compound,</b> and {{anaerobic}} chemical sealants {{that are}} used to make a pipe thread joint leak proof and pressure tight. Although common pipe threads are tapered and therefore will achieve an interference fit during proper assembly, machining and finishing variances usually result in a fit that does not result in 100 percent contact between the mating components. The application of pipe dope prior to assembly will fill the minute voids between the threads, thus making the joint pressure tight. Pipe dope also acts as a lubricant and helps prevent seizing of the mating parts, which can later cause difficulty during disassembly.|$|E

25|$|Maintenance of {{adequate}} tire inflation {{is the most}} frequent and troublesome concern for cyclists and many means and methods are employed to preserve pneumatic integrity.

Thin, light bicycle tires are particularly vulnerable to penetration and subsequent deflation caused by goat's heads and other burs, colloquially known as stickers.

5000|$|The {{double seam}} is made using a double seamer, which can {{have just one}} or a number of heads or seaming stations. The double seam is formed by {{mechanically}} interlocking five layers of material together: three layers of the can end and two layers of the can body. Each seaming head typically consists of two rolls, a first operation roll and second operation roll, and a chuck. Some seaming machines have two first operation rolls and two second operation rolls and a few machines use a method called [...] "rail seaming" [...] which requires no rolls. During the seaming operation, the can end is lowered on to the filled can body and held down by the chuck, which acts as an anvil to the seaming operation. The first operation roll then engages the can end against the can body thereby folding the end curl around the flange of the body. In some seaming machines, this is done as the can is turning at high speed. In other seaming machines, the can is stationary and the first operation roll (or rolls) spins around several times to ensure a complete first operation. After the first operation is complete, the first operation roll disengages from the can and the second operation roll then engages the can. The purpose of the second operation is to iron out the double seam into its final shape and remove the voids between the layers of can and end material. In practice, ironing {{out all of the}} can and end material in a double seam without leaving some voids is impossible without the use of a <b>sealing</b> <b>compound.</b>|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a cooperation project, ceramic components of alumina, Al 2 O 3, were sealed in a gastight manner for chemical applications using a <b>sealing</b> <b>compound</b> based on ceramic raw materials. The sealing is adapted to the Al 2 O 3 ceramic with respect to expansion coefficient and wettability and it is inert, mechanically stable, chemically resistant and above all gastight at application temperatures of approx. 1000 degreesC.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{performance of}} the mineral components in seals of landfill sites was investigated with special reverence to clayey substrates. As a main feature of these sealing substrates the interfering aspect {{of the formation of}} pore structures, which are caused by mechanical processes as well as by hydraulic processes, is the limiting factor using these seals in practice. During the seal installation primary interaggregate pores are closed by mechanical consolidation while the subsequent hydraulic consolidation causes a new formation of secondary interaggregate pores or shrinkage cracks, respectively. Both, primary and secondary interaggregate pores are macropores and decrease the efficiency of seals. With a new developed Proctor Test mineral substrates with varying consistency were stressed by mechanical forces as well as by hydraulic forces, which leads to the states of equal mechanical (Ea) and hydraulic (h) consolidation energies, expressed in Ea- and Ea-h-isoenergetics. The volume of primary and secondary interaggregate pores, important for the sealing quality of the clayey substrates, can be concluded from these isoenergetics for different water contents. The water content of German <b>seal</b> <b>compounds</b> has to meet the standard Proctor Test (DIN 18127) at application time. In contrast to the newly introduced Proctor Test the standard Proctor Test simulate only mechanical consolidation processes. Considering the hydraulic consolidation processes as well, the appropriate water content of mineral substrates with plastic properties is reduced. For the examined clays with medium and strong consistency this amounts in about 7 weight-% below the plastic limit of Atterberg. In addition, the formation of primary and secondary interaggregate pores is also affected by the mechanical forces. The concept of an extended Proctor Test including the aspect of hydraulic consolidation has lead to an extension of the Atterberg limits...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The standard agar plate technique {{was found to be}} a good method for screening the presence of leachable antimicrobial additives in rubber compounds. However, this technique restricts the growth of microorganisms to the perimeter of the samples and is less satisfactory as a long term test. In a liquid medium, there should not be any problem for the microorganisms {{to gain access to the}} inorganic and organic nutrients as well as oxygen. Many experimental trials were carried out in liquid media under dynamic and static conditions with Streptomyces lipmanii NCIMB 9841 as test organism. This led to the development of the modified batch processes. The modified tests allowed experiments to be performed over a long period of time without concern of accumulation of toxins from the leachable antimicrobial additives in the rubber samples and the metabolites from the utilisation of carbon sources by the microorganisms. The test procedure developed proved to be very reproducible and repeatable. The use of neutral chemically defined media with no added carbon source, the absence of strong oxidation catalysts coupled with the use of proper control samples defined the least vigorous conditions for biodeterioration of rubber compounds. On the other hand, the degradation of the rubber compounds under field and semi-field tests is likely to be a combined effect of biodeterioration, hydrolytic degradation, leaching and oxidation of samples. Five strains of fungi and four strains of actinomycetes were tested against five carbon black-filled <b>seal</b> <b>compounds.</b> The types of rubbers used were based on natural, styrene/butadiene, peroxide-cured EPDM, sulphur-cured EPDM and acrylonitrile /butadiene rubbers.

The strains NCIMB 12811 and 12814 had activity towards vulcanised gum NR samples, whilst Nocardia asteriodes NCIMB 12082 was very capable of utilizing rubber additives. It was found that besides the physical dimensions, types and formulations of rubber compounds; test conditions such as temperature, agitation speed, pH; amount of rubber sample used per unit volume of test medium, and renewal or non-renewal of test media also played an important role in affecting the activities of microorganisms towards rubber compounds...|$|R
