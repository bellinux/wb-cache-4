40|$|The Independent Studies program {{closed in}} 2016. This thesis {{was one of}} 25 {{accepted}} by Library for long-term preservation and presentation in UWSpace. In contradiction with much conventional economic theory, this thesis argues that successful <b>short-term</b> <b>forecasting</b> is both possible and practicable. Beginning with the assumption, and widely-held belief, that there are patterns to be discovered in the stock market, the thesis develops the <b>Short-Term</b> <b>Forecasting</b> Theory (STFT) to demonstrate how useful and accurate <b>short-term</b> <b>forecasts</b> might be achieved. In short, this thesis posits that, if <b>short-term</b> financial <b>forecasting</b> of an equity {{can be broken down}} to a mechanical procedure, the problem of <b>short-term</b> <b>forecasting</b> is reduced to the question of finding the proper tools for this procedure. This thesis presents two computing methods – fuzzy logic and neural networks – that, when combined, could serve as an appropriate tool for implementation...|$|R

50|$|To study FAI, the RAX {{mission will}} utilize a large {{incoherent}} scatter radar in Poker Flats, Alaska (known as PFISR). PFISR will transmit powerful radio signals into the plasma instabilities {{that will be}} scattered into space. During that time, the RAX spacecraft will be orbiting overhead and recording the scatter signals with an onboard receiver. These signal recordings will be processed by an onboard computer and transmitted back to our ground stations where scientists will analyze them. The goal of this one-year science mission is to enhance our understanding of FAI formation so that <b>short-term</b> <b>forecast</b> models can be generated. This will aid spacecraft operators with planning their mission operations around periods of expected communication disruption.|$|E
50|$|The {{goal of the}} RAX-2 {{mission is}} to enhance {{understanding}} of FAI formation so that <b>short-term</b> <b>forecast</b> models can be generated.

The RAX-1 mission made great strides in CubeSat design, {{and was able to}} execute bistatic radar measurements never before been performed with such a spacecraft. RAX team members applied the lessons learned from RAX-1 to the design of a second flight unit, RAX-2, which will perform the same mission concept of the first RAX that launched in November 2010, with improved bus performance and additional operational modes. Science measurements will be enhanced through interactive experiments with high power ionospheric heaters where FAI will be generated on demand.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of econometric models to <b>short-term</b> <b>forecasting,</b> {{that is to}} say, forecasting up to one year ahead, has naturally enough been extensively discussed. Some of the discussion has centred on the usefulness of econometric models in general for this purpose as against other forecasting methods. It is clearly realised that <b>short-term</b> <b>forecasting</b> by means of non-econometric methods is not only possible but may give better results than are obtained {{by the use of}} econometric models. It is therefore quite legitimate to argue against the use of models in the realm of <b>short-term</b> <b>forecasting.</b> If, on the other hand, one believes that econometric models can make a useful contribution in this field, then the question arises what kind of models are most appropriate for this purpose...|$|R

Its iteration of the concept involved both the production of 30-second news updates that aired {{at or near the}} top of each hour during local commercial break inserts - even during prime time network and overnight programming - and five-second end-of-break weather updates (consisting of an image of the station's Doppler radar, then known as [...] "Doppler 4 Radar", usually accompanied by a brief voiceover by one of the station's meteorologists illustrating the <b>short-term</b> <b>forecast</b> or teasing the weather segment in an upcoming newscast), during time periods when the station was not airing its regularly scheduled, long-form newscasts. In September 1992, WDAF became the first television station in Kansas City to launch a weekend morning newscast, with the debut of two-hour-long Saturday and Sunday broadcasts that initially aired from 8:00 to 10:00 a.m. (both editions would later move to 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. in September 1997, with the Saturday moving one hour earlier on April 23, 2016).|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the long-term forecast of grain production potential can be tested by the <b>short-term</b> <b>forecast</b> results of grain production potential, and the scientific basis for the national strategy of grain production also can be provided. The theory of <b>short-term</b> <b>forecast</b> of the grain production potential, namely, the theory of trend-volatility, is established {{on the basis of}} the concept of current production potential of grain or crop and the conceptual model of climate, human and land. Forecasting model is the moving average trend model of multi-year per unit area yield under the condition of the optimum moving step. The systematic forecast method was used to predict the short-term grain production potential. The above theory and methods were demonstrated by 11 cases in China and three provinces, respectively. The average error of 11 cases was 0. 77 %, the maximum error was 2. 99 %, and the {{accuracy of}} prediction was high.

30|$|The current {{approach}} {{is based on}} the assumption that the shifted charging does not effect the generation dispatch and the smart charging system has perfect foresight. It can therefore only offer the users feedback based on historical saving potentials. An actual smart charging algorithm would need operate on a <b>short-term</b> <b>forecast</b> for the CO 2 emission factors. For this, a <b>short-term</b> <b>forecast</b> for CO 2 emission factors during the next few hours is required. Since the pattern of CO 2 emission factors shows a high similarity to wholesale prices, this forecast could base on findings on short-term electricity price forecasting. The optimization further has to deal with the uncertainty of these forecasts in order to achieve the best possible charging pattern. The results presented here can serve as a benchmark in such a development.|$|E
30|$|Only sudden {{changes in}} generation/load, {{that are not}} {{captured}} in a very <b>short-term</b> <b>forecast</b> as well as unplanned system events such as equipment outages (for example, overhead line outages), could produce differences between UKF and WLS-based SE estimates that are not the consequence of a malicious attack and would therefore lead to false positive detections. However, such detections could easily be disregarded after the system operator becomes aware of them. Orchestrating FDI attacks during such unplanned events to evade detections is regarded as highly unlikely. An attacker would need {{to have access to}} all the measurements in the region over a long period and then attack one of the SVs affected by the outage during a short time frame (inside a 5 minute’ interval, before the next execution of a very <b>short-term</b> <b>forecast).</b>|$|E

40|$|DSGE {{models are}} useful tools for {{evaluating}} the impact of policy changes but their use for (<b>short-term)</b> <b>forecasting</b> is still at an infant stage. Besides theory based restrictions, the timeliness of data is an important issue. Since DSGE models are based on quarterly data, they are vulnerable to a publication lag of quarterly national accounts. In this {{paper we propose a}} framework for a <b>short-term</b> <b>forecasting</b> of GDP based on a medium-scale DSGE model for a small open economy within a currency area that utilizes the timely information available in monthly conjunctural indicators. To this end we adopt a methodology proposed by Giannone, Monti and Reichlin (2009). Using Austrian data we find that the forecasting performance of the DSGE model can be improved considerably by conjunctural indicators while still maintaining the story-telling capability of the model.

40|$|In the UK market, {{the total}} price of {{renewable}} electricity {{is made up}} of the Renewables Obligation Certificate and the price achieved for the electricity.
