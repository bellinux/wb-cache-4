40|$|A {{method for}} {{visualizing}} streaklines in hypervelocity flows has been developed. The method uses the high temperatures produced in hypervelocity flows to ablate {{small amounts of}} sodium deposited onto a wire stretched across the flow and to broaden the lines in the <b>sodium</b> <b>spectrum.</b> By using a dye laser, tuned to a wavelength close {{to one of the}} sodium D-lines, as the light source in shadowgraph or Schlieren visualization, streaklines seeded with sodium become visible through absorption and/or enhanced refractivity.

An easy approach {{is shown in the}} treatment of the emission spectrum of the sodium atom without any involved calculations. In a previous article, the hydrogen spectrum was considered and the energy degeneracy of the angular momentum quantum number was observed. For the <b>sodium</b> <b>spectrum,</b> due to the valence electron penetration into internal shells, a breakdown of this degeneracy occurs and a dependence of this penetration on the angular momentum quantum number is observed.

40|$|Nematic lyotropic liquid {{crystalline}} materials, which spontaneously align in {{a magnetic}} field (Type II) have been prepared from a mixed detergent system consisting of potassium dodecanoate and decyltrimethylammonium bromide. This system has an advantage that the charge on the interface of the finite disc micelles can be readily varied. Sodium and bromide ion interactions with the interface have been investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance of the ions. Deuterium magnetic resonance spectra of deuteriated water and specifically deuteriated detergent chains have been obtained. The results {{show that there is}} a water structure built around the carboxylate headgroups which ceases to be stable when about 30 % of potassium dodecanoate is replaced by decyltrimethylammonium bromide. Bromine magnetic resonance studies show that the bromide ion interacts only weakly with carboxylate but indicates, as would be expected, much stronger interaction with the trimethylammonium groups. The sodium ion in contrast was found to bind strongly with carboxylate and weakly with trimethylammonium. The <b>sodium</b> <b>spectra</b> indicate that the association of sodium with carboxylate is complex, involving two specific binding sites. Deuterium spectra from deuteriated hydrocarbon chains are interpreted in terms of the motional freedom of the individual chains.

The potassium cloud is a long-lived phenomenon which undergoes periodic fluctuations in response to solar radiation pressure and the ionizing influence of Jupiter's plasma torus. These give rise to east-west and north-south asymmetry variations similar to those observed for the sodium cloud. Evidence for temporary jets of potassium streaming from Io have also been observed.

The purpose of this work was to quantify the effect of interleukin- 1 (IL- 1 β) -induced macromolecule depletion on the residual quadrupolar interaction (RQI) of sodium in bovine cartilage plugs. Materials and Methods—Fifteen 8 -mm-diameter cartilage plug specimens were cored from the articular surface of fresh bovine patellae. All plugs were kept in culture media and nine of the plugs were subjected to interleukin- 1 (IL- 1 β) -induced degeneration of cartilage for 4, 6, and 7 days. <b>Sodium</b> NMR <b>spectra</b> were obtained from each sample with a 1 -cm-diameter solenoid coil in a 2 T whole-body magnet interfaced to a custom-built spectrometer.

The model assumes a static Gaussian distribution of the RQI frequency, ωQ, in the sample.

40|$|The nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) <b>spectrum</b> of <b>sodium</b> was determined in muscle and erythrocytes using conventional continuous wave techniques. NMR spectra of fresh intact muscle revealed a single line with a width of about 38 Hz equivalent in intensity to about 53 % of the total muscle sodium, in general agreement with previous work. Prolonged washing with sodium-free solutions led to a marked loss of both total and NMR-detectable sodium. The NMR-visible sodium remaining in the muscle was somewhat larger than the fraction calculated to remain extracellular and, presumably, was intracellular. The original sodium signal is thus interpreted as arising from both extracellular sodium and the narrow line portion of the signal from intracellular <b>sodium.</b> NMR <b>spectra</b> of <b>sodium</b> were also obtained for human erythrocytes under conditions preserving the sodium transport system. The intensity of the sodium signal in fresh cells was 98 % of that present in the same samples after complete hemolysis of the cells.

Suppl. 66, 397 - 411) formalism. The innovative aspect of our approach consists in building up polienergetic spectra as linear combination of normalized single velocity spectra. In this way we simulate the dispersion of the sodium atom ejection velocities at the exobase and derive for each velocity component a production rate. Smyth and Combi (1988, Astrophys.

We have applied the polienergetic model spectra approach to analyze a sequence of 59 observations of the sodium cloud spanning a period of 4 years from February 1990 to April 1994. The echelle spectra have been reduced to separate the fast sodium components and then compared to polienergetic synthetic spectra.

It was not clear, however, whether the liquid is still present today or whether it has frozen.

This is the first lidar measurement of the mesopause temperature in Antarctica and it will reveal the characteristics of gravity wave activities and the energetic interaction between the lower thermosphere and the upper mesosphere through the mesopause region over Antarctica. For the temperature observations, a new laser transmitter is developed using injection-seeded Nd : YAG lasers. The principal advantage of this instrument is that the transmitter is simple and a reliable solid state system which requires less maintenance compared with ordinary dye laser type transmitters.

Here we examine in situ effects of (1) street lamp replacement and (2) the spatial distribution of local street lighting on garden moth communities in Birmingham, UK, to determine whether current shifts in street lighting infrastructure are leading to an increased attraction of moths into suburban areas. Using a unique beforeafter- control-impact survey, we show that switching from narrow (low-pressure <b>sodium)</b> to broad <b>spectrum</b> (high-pressure <b>sodium)</b> lamps significantly increases the diversity of macro-moths in suburban gardens.

40|$|Electron spin {{resonance}} {{spectra of}} small particles (≃ 5000 Å) of sodium, potassium, and rubidium metals were recorded at temperatures between 4 and 150 K. The main {{feature of the}} <b>sodium</b> and potassium <b>spectra</b> is a single resonance which we assign to colloidal particles; it has a Lorentzian or other symmetric form at higher temperatures but becomes noticeably asymmetric on cooling. The onset of asymmetry is predicted when the microwaves can no longer penetrate throughout the particle, so from independent measurements of the microwave skin depth the approximate particle size may be evaluated. The metal colloid signals were analyzed to yield line widths and g values, and the temperature dependence of the electron spin relaxation rate, T 2 - 1, was deduced. In the case of potassium a second absorption signal, very narrow and relatively easily saturated, was observed superimposed on the colloid peak. The origin of this resonance is discussed. It is possible to identify two components in the electron spin relaxation rate; a temperature-dependent term, and a temperature-independent term which {{gives rise to a}} characteristic residual line width at the lowest temperatures. The latter term corresponds to spin relaxation at the particle surface and its value can thus yield a second estimate of the particle size. The temperature-dependent term bears a strong similarity to the resistivity relaxation rate τR- 1 in bulk metals. We have also measured the magnetic susceptibility of the sodium colloids using a high-sensitivity Faraday balance.

SDS-PAGE showed that the triple helix of PSC-Sm was formed as ((1)) (3) by 3 (1) chain homologous with molecular weight of 137 kDa. The T-m of PSC-Sm and calf skin collagen (CSC) were 30. 2 and 35. 0 oC, respectively, which consistent with the result of FTIR that CSC contained more stable triple-helix than PSC-Sm. Peptide maps were different between PSC-Sm and CSC, indicating the differences in their amino acid compositions and sequences. The maximum and minimum solubilities of PSC-Sm were observed at pH 2. 0 and 4. 0, respectively. A sharp decrease in solubility appeared when NaCl concentration was between 3 % and 5 %.

Reflectance <b>spectra</b> of upper fully expanded leaves were acquired over visible and infrared (NIR) wavelengths. Additionally, canopy reflectance for the four arsenic levels was simulated using SAIL (Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) model for various soil moisture conditions and leaf area indices (LAI). Further, sensitivity of various vegetative indices (VIs) to arsenic levels was assessed. Results suggest that plants accumulate high arsenic amounts causing plant stress and changes in reflectance characteristics. All leaf spectra based VIs related strongly with arsenic with coefficient of determination (r²) greater than 0. 6 while at canopy scale, background reflectance and LAI confounded with spectral signals of arsenic affecting the VIs’ performance. Among studied VIs, combined index, transformed chlorophyll absorption reflectance index (TCARI) /optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) exhibited higher sensitivity to arsenic levels and better resistance to soil backgrounds and LAI followed by red edge based VIs (modified chlorophyll absorption reflectance index (MCARI) and TCARI) suggesting that these VIs could prove to be valuable aids for monitoring arsenic in rice fields...|$|R
40|$|Semiconductors such as CuInGaSe 2 and CdTe {{have been}} {{investigated}} as absorber layer materials for thin film solar cells since their band gap matches with the solar spectrum. Films as thin as 2 m are sufficient for the absorption of the visible part of solar radiation, because they are characterized by a high absorption coefficient. However, the scarcity and high costs of Indium, Gallium and Tellurium have led to concerns on the sustainability of these technologies. The semiconductor Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 (Copper Zinc Tin Sulphide) consisting of abundantly available elements promises to be an excellent photovoltaic absorber material. The present study {{is focused on the}} growth and characterization of CZTS/ZnS thin film heterostructure suitable for PV applications. Ultrasonic Spray Pyrolysis (USP), a variation of Spray Pyrolysis is a thin film deposition technique where the solution to be sprayed is atomized by ultrasonic frequencies. The details of the USP experimental set up and the deposition principle are presented in the thesis. The active layers of the solar cell, viz. the CZTS absorber layer and ZnS emitter layer were grown by this technique. The metal top contact was deposited using e-beam evaporation. The effects of copper concentration and sodium diffusion on the Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 film properties were investigated. The films have shown preferred orientation along (112) direction confirming kesterite structure. The optical studies revealed that a reduction of copper in the films will bring the band gap energy to 1. 5 eV, which will match with the solar <b>spectrum.</b> <b>Sodium</b> diffusion in the CZTS films is found to passivate the grain boundaries and enhance the electrical conductivity. These properties render CZTS films as good photovoltaic absorber layers. ZnS has a high band gap and is non toxic unlike CdS. The influences of variation in substrate temperature and spray duration on the ZnS film properties were examined. The optical studies conducted on ZnS films revealed that they are highly transparent in the visible region of the solar spectrum. The films were found to possess a band gap of 3. 5 eV. These properties make them potential candidates as solar cell emitter layers. The CZTS/ZnS heterojunction solar cell was fabricated and subjected to electrical characterization in dark and illuminated conditions. A conversion efficiency of 1. 16 % was achieved for the device...|$|R
