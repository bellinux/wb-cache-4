40|$|Abstract. The paper distinguishes three {{strategies}} {{by means}} of which empirical discoveries {{about the nature of}} morality can be used to undermine moral judgements. On the first strategy, moral judgements are <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be unjustified in virtue of being <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> rest on ignorance or false belief. On the second strategy, moral judgements are <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be false by being <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> entail claims inconsistent with the relevant empirical discoveries. On the third strategy, moral judgements are <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be false in virtue of being <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be unjustified; truth having been defined epistemologically in terms of justification. By interpreting three recent error theoretical arguments in light of these strategies, the paper evaluates the epistemological and metaphysical relevance of empirical discoveries about morality as a naturally evolved phenomenon...|$|R

50|$|The {{olfactory}} tubercle {{has been}} <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> play {{a large role}} in behavior.

50|$|The AP-1 {{transcription}} factor has been <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> play numerous roles in cell growth and proliferation. In particular, c-Fos and c-Jun {{seem to be}} major players in these processes. C-jun has been <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be essential for fibroblast proliferation, and levels of both AP-1 subunits have been <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be expressed above basal levels during cell division. C-fos has also been <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> increase in expression {{in response to the}} introduction of growth factors in the cell, further supporting its suggested involvement in the cell cycle. The growth factors TGF alpha, TGF beta, and IL2 have all been <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> stimulate c-Fos, and thereby stimulate cellular proliferation via AP-1 activation.|$|R
