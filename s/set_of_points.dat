5|$|The {{input to}} a {{clustering}} problem {{consists of a}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>points.</b> A cluster is any proper subset of the points, and a hierarchical clustering is a maximal family of clusters with the property that any two clusters in the family are either nested or disjoint.|$|E

The same idea applies for any dimension n; the equation x02 + x12 + ⋯ + x'n2 = 1 produces the n-sphere as a geometric object in (n + 1)-dimensional space. For example, the 1-sphere S1 is a circle.|$|E

5|$|In {{computational}} geometry, the duality between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations {{implies that}} any algorithm for constructing a Voronoi diagram can be immediately converted into an algorithm for the Delaunay triangulation, and vice versa. The same duality {{can also be}} used in finite element mesh generation. Lloyd's algorithm, a method based on Voronoi diagrams for moving a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> on a surface to more evenly spaced positions, is commonly used as a way to smooth a finite element mesh described by the dual Delaunay triangulation. This method improves the mesh by making its triangles more uniformly sized and shaped.|$|E
5|$|The Grayrigg {{derailment}} was a fatal railway {{accident that}} occurred at approximately 20:15 GMT on 23 February 2007, {{just to the}} south of Grayrigg, Cumbria, in the North West England region of the United Kingdom. The accident investigation concluded that the derailment was caused by a faulty <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> (number 2B) on the Down Main running line, controlled from Lambrigg ground frame. The scheduled inspection on 18 February 2007 had not taken place and the faults had gone undetected.|$|E
5|$|Instead {{of solving}} {{for the two}} hyperbolas, Newton {{constructs}} their directrix lines instead. For any hyperbola, the ratio of distances from a point Z to a focus A and to the directrix is a fixed constant called the eccentricity. The two directrices intersect at a point T, and from their two known distance ratios, Newton constructs a line passing through T on which Z must lie. However, the ratio of distances TZ/TA is also known; hence, Z also lies on a known circle, since Apollonius had shown that a circle {{can be defined as}} the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> that have a given ratio of distances to two fixed points. (As an aside, this definition is the basis of bipolar coordinates.) Thus, the solutions to Apollonius' problem are the intersections of a line with a circle.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 13 October 1940, during the Blitz, a lone German {{aircraft}} dropped a single bomb on houses {{to the north of}} Bounds Green station. The destruction of the houses caused {{the north end of the}} westbound platform tunnel to collapse. As a result, train services between Wood Green and Cockfosters were disrupted for two months. On 11 August 1948, a passenger train was derailed when the front and rear bogies of a carriage took different routes at a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> at the station. On 7 July 2005, a bomb was exploded on a train travelling between King's Cross St. Pancras and Russell Square. As a result, train services between Hyde Park Corner and Arnos Grove were disrupted until 4 August of the same year.|$|E
5|$|Voronoi or Dirichlet tilings are tessellations {{where each}} tile {{is defined as}} the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> closest to one of the points in a {{discrete}} set of defining points. (Think of geographical regions where each region is defined as all the points closest to a given city or post office.) The Voronoi cell for each defining point is a convex polygon. The Delaunay triangulation is a tessellation that is the dual graph of a Voronoi tessellation. Delaunay triangulations are useful in numerical simulation, in part because among all possible triangulations of the defining points, Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum of the angles formed by the edges. Voronoi tilings with randomly placed points can be used to construct random tilings of the plane.|$|E
