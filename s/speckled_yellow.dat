50|$|The banded {{hare-wallaby}} is nocturnal {{and tends to}} live in groups at nesting sites; this species is quite social. Nesting occurs in thickets under very dense brush. This macropod prefers to live in Acacia ligulata scrub. Males are extremely aggressive. The average {{banded hare-wallaby}} weighs 1.7 kg, with females weighing more than males. It measures about 800mm from the head {{to the end of}} the tail, with the tail almost the same length (averaging 375mm) as the body. The banded hare-wallaby has a short nose. Long, grey fur is <b>speckled</b> with <b>yellow</b> and silver and fades into a light grey on the underbelly. There is no color variation on the face or head, the coloring is solid grey. Dark, horizontal stripes of fur start at the middle of the back and stop at the base of the tail.|$|R
60|$|The whole {{expanse of}} the Downs escarpment, {{so far as the}} grey haze {{permitted}} him to see, was set with wind-wheels to which the largest of the city was but a younger brother. They stirred with a stately motion before the south-west wind. And here and there were patches dotted with the sheep of the British Food Trust, and here and there a mounted shepherd made a spot of black. Then rushing under the stern of the aeropile came the Wealden Heights, the line of Hindhead, Pitch Hill, and Leith Hill, with a second row of wind-wheels that seemed striving to rob the downland whirlers of their share of breeze. The purple heather was <b>speckled</b> with <b>yellow</b> gorse, and on the further side a drove of black oxen stampeded before a couple of mounted men. Swiftly these swept behind, and dwindled and lost colour, and became scarce moving specks that were swallowed up in haze.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on {{the leaves}} of Symplocos species. The body of mature larvae is dark brown, <b>speckled</b> with minute <b>yellow</b> dots within each of which a short bristle is found. There is an extensile sublateral flap of skin on the metathoracic and two {{anterior}} abdominal segments. When the larva is disturbed this flap is expanded, with the head and anterior part of the thorax retracted, the inflatable organ expandsto resemble an eye, and the caudal horn is swung from side to side. Pupation {{takes place in a}} small cocoon of tough brown silk spun amongst leaves of the host plant.|$|R
50|$|In this species, the {{carapace}} is reddish brown, ovoid to elongated, with wide, radiating, black {{lines or}} large, black specks. The plastron is mostly yellow {{and may have}} short, fat lines, specks, or be uniformly colored. The head is <b>speckled,</b> with a <b>yellow</b> throat. The neck is striped. Hatchlings have wide head and neck stripes and yellow plastrons. The bridge is predominantly yellow with black stripes or entirely black. It is mostly morphologically indistinguishable from the western black-bridged leaf turtle, C. atripons, requiring genetic sampling to confidently identify. Some authorities consider this species to be a junior synonym to or a subspecies of C. atripons.|$|R
5000|$|Blanding's turtle is a {{medium-sized}} turtle {{with an average}} shell length of approximately 18 to 23 cm with a maximum of 25.5 cm. A distinguishing feature of this turtle is the bright yellow chin and throat. The carapace, or upper shell, is domed, but slightly flattened along the midline, and is oblong when viewed from above. The carapace is <b>speckled</b> with numerous <b>yellow</b> or light-colored flecks or streaks on a dark background. The plastron, or lower shell, is yellow with dark blotches symmetrically arranged. The head and legs are dark, and usually speckled or mottled with yellow. Blanding's turtle is also called the [...] "semi-box" [...] turtle, for although the plastron is hinged, the plastral lobes do not shut as tight as the box turtle's.|$|R
5000|$|Mugger {{crocodiles}} {{are also}} seen in small {{number in the}} Girwa river,as their favorite haunts are stagnant wetlands like the many taals and baghars that dot the sanctuary. Side by side the serenely swimming gharial can be seen frolicking Ganges dolphins. Recent discoveries in herpetofauna of Katerniaghat are highly fascinating and are represented by several species such as the banded krait, the Burmese rock python, the <b>yellow</b> <b>speckled</b> wolf-snake and the paradise flying snake. In 2012, a rare red coral kukri snake was sighted in the sanctuary. This snake with the scientific name Oligodon kheriensis was first described from the North Kheri Division in 1936.This Project Tiger reserve was written off by the conservationists in the year 2005, when Ramesh_K._Pandey, took over the charge of the sanctuary and turned the things around and restored the habitat and tiger population in the reserve with his much admired work.|$|R
5000|$|Guenons, {{the largest}} group of African primates, are very colorful. Their color is used in {{intraspecific}} communication for recognizing individuals, species, and potential mates. Wolf's mona monkey is dark grey with a red [...] "saddle" [...] on its back. The pelage depends on the subspecies. C. wolfi wolfi has a chestnut-colored patch on the middle of its back. Its arms are black and legs are red. It has a yellow underside, occasionally with an orange stripe down its flanks. Its cheek whiskers are <b>yellow,</b> <b>speckled</b> with black, and its ear tufts are red. C. wolfi elegans has a back which is gradually browner towards the rump. Its forearms are black, and its upper arms have a pale speckling. Its legs are light gray, while its underside is white. Its cheek whiskers are white, with dark speckling that increases near the base. Its ear tufts are white. The male's scrotum is blue. Wolf's mona monkey is also sexually dimorphic in size. Males weigh, on average, almost twice as much as females, 4.5 kg and 2.5 kg respectively. Its small size makes it susceptible to predators, especially the crowned eagle and the leopard.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Fisheries, 2010 I {{investigated}} the species assemblage and abundances {{of fish and}} macroinvertebrates inhabiting the lower three km of Fourmile Creek, an altered and largely unstudied intermittent tributary to Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon. Seasonal reproductive state, body condition and diet of the four most abundant fish (speckled dace, Rhinichthys osculus, fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas, slender sculpin, Cottus tenuis, and yellow perch, Perca flavescens) were also examined. Nine native and seven non-native fish species from eight families were captured March ??? October, 2005 and 2006. Native species, including speckled dace and slender sculpin, tended to dominate the fish catch from March ??? August; non-native species, including fathead minnow and yellow perch, increased in abundance during fall. Both abundance and species richness were greatest at sites situated within the lower one km of Fourmile Creek where surface flow persisted longer and water quality (temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH) {{tended to be more}} stable than at more ephemeral upper creek sites. Gonadosomatic indices and the presence of larvae and juveniles show Fourmile Creek to be an important breeding habitat for speckled dace, slender sculpin and other native fish. <b>Speckled</b> dace and <b>yellow</b> perch spawn in spring, fathead minnow spawn in summer, and slender sculpin spawn during late summer/fall. Condition factors of sexually mature fish tended to decrease both during their reproductive season, and as surface waters disappeared. Especially poor body condition in slender sculpin likely resulted from the temporal overlap of reproduction with stream drying, followed by growth-limiting winter habitat conditions. Benthic insects and crustaceans were the most important foods for speckled dace and slender sculpin; detritus and crustaceans were the most important foods for fathead minnow; insects, crustaceans and fish were the most important foods for yellow perch. Dietary overlap between speckled dace and fathead minnow was not significant across seasons, even as the creek dried, suggesting minimal dietary competition between these two abundant cyprinid species. Crustaceans, insects and annelids were the dominant macroinvertebrates inhabiting Fourmile Creek. Cladocerans and copepods, the dominant crustacean taxa, peaked in abundance during spring/early summer and during the fall. Dipterans (principally chironimid larvae) dominated the insect community during most months, while hemipteran and coleopteran taxa increased in abundance as the creek dried. Other insects, including simuliid larvae, were only abundant until early summer, when water flow decreased...|$|R
