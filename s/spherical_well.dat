40|$|Recently, {{the problem}} of the {{infinite}} <b>spherical</b> <b>well</b> was solved by the group-theoretical method to resolve all the peculiarities in the currently accepted solution [DOI: 10. 13140 /RG. 2. 2. 18172. 44162 (Researchgate, 2017) ]. With a view to further justifying the group-theoretical method, the problem is first studied from the viewpoint of classical mechanics. Then the radial probability densities predicted by classical mechanics are compared with those predicted from solutions of the problem obtained by the group-theoretical method. The comparisons clearly indicate the convergence of predictions of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics in the limit of large eigen-energies. Therefore, the group-theoretical method is justified as the right way to solve {{the problem of}} the infinite <b>spherical</b> <b>well.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

40|$|We address an {{eigenvalue}} {{problem for}} the ultrarelativistic (Cauchy) operator (-Δ) ^ 1 / 2, whose action is restricted to functions that vanish beyond {{the interior of a}} unit sphere in three spatial dimensions. We provide high accuracy spectral datafor lowest eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this infinite <b>spherical</b> <b>well</b> problem. Our focus is on radial and orbital shapes of eigenfunctions. The spectrum consists of an ordered set of strictly positive eigenvalues which naturally splits into non-overlapping, orbitally labelled E_(k,l) series. For each orbital label l= 0, 1, 2, [...] . the label k = 1, 2, [...] . enumerates consecutive l-th series eigenvalues. Each of them is 2 l+ 1 -degenerate. The l= 0 eigenvalues series E_(k, 0) are identical with the set of even labeled eigenvalues for the d= 1 Cauchy well: E_(k, 0) (d= 3) =E_ 2 k(d= 1). Likewise, the eigenfunctions ψ_(k, 0) (d= 3) and ψ_ 2 k (d= 1) show affinity. We have identified the generic functional form of eigenfunctions of the <b>spherical</b> <b>well</b> which appear to be composed of a product of a solid harmonic and of a suitable purely radial function. The method to evaluate (approximately) the latter has been found to follow the universal pattern which effectively allows to skip all, sometimes involved, intermediate calculations (those were in usage, while computing the eigenvalues for l ≤ 3) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{model for the}} intermolecular proton transfer AH+ + B ⇄ A + HB+ between identical molecules A and B in solution is proposed. The proton is initially assumed {{to be in the}} ground bound state of a three dimensional (3 D) spherical potential well belonging to molecule A. When the diffusing molecules A and B collide, the proton can tunnel through a 3 D potential barrier and be trapped in an equivalent 3 D <b>spherical</b> <b>well</b> belonging to molecule B. This corresponds to a resonant process in a 3 D double potential well. An analytic expression of the transfer rate can be obtained by evaluating the resonance frequency of the double well within the LCAO approximation, and by using a classical description of the relative diffusion of the molecules. Typical values of the tunnelling transfer rate are provided and it is shown that this mechanism may dominate the normal activated process as the temperature is lowered...|$|E
