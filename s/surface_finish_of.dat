25|$|The {{work done}} by {{friction}} can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials {{such as in the}} process of friction welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (fretting) exacerbates wear of frictional forces. Bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, fit and <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> <b>of</b> an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly.|$|E

40|$|Medium {{carbon steel}} rails are {{commonly}} jointed {{by means of}} a flash butt welding procedure. To ensure an adequate service life for the structural component commonly subjected to fatigue loading, a rigorous quality control should be performed, both in welding parameters and in the surface quality of the welded joint. This work investigated the cause of a recurrent failure in a railway, with cracking always initiated in the rail in the region of the welded joint. All standard procedures of failure analysis were applied, with a careful assessment of the material characteristics and the fractured surface. It was concluded that fatigue cracks initiated near the weld bead and spread in a brittle mode, leading to premature fracture of the material. An in-depth analysis of the early cracks showed that the <b>surface</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>of</b> the weld bead was not appropriate, generating undesirable stress concentration. A recommendation to change the procedure <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>of</b> welded joint was held, aiming to decrease the number of accidents on the railway line...|$|R

40|$|Plastic {{industry}} is {{today in a}} constant growth, demanding several products from other segments, which includes the plastic molds, mainly used in the injection molding process. Considering all the requirements of plastic molds, the <b>surface</b> <b>finishing</b> is <b>of</b> special interest, as the injected plastic part is able to reproduce any details (and also defects) from the mold surface. Therefore, several aspects on mold finishing are important, mainly related to manufacturing conditions - machining, grinding, polishing and texturing, and also related to the tool steel quality, in relation to microstructure homogeneity and non-metallic inclusions (cleanliness). The present paper is then focused on this interrelationship between steel quality and manufacturing process, which are both related to the final quality of plastic mold surfaces.

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>of</b> {{dies and}} molds {{is one of}} the most {{interesting}} applications of laser polishing process. Because of the variety of materials used in die and mold manufacturing, as well as the different surface topographies, in each case, it is necessary to use appropriate process parameters. The presented work focuses on the study of laser polishing process on three commonly used materials in the manufacture of dies and molds, such as tool steels AISI D 2 and AISI P 20, ductile cast iron GGG 70 L and LaserForm ST- 100, a specific material developed for plastic injection mold making. Experimental studies were carried out determining the influence of the energy density on the roughness reduction rate. A key point that has a direct impact on the resulting surface roughness is the initial <b>surface</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>of</b> the material before laser polishing. In order to determine the degree of influence, experimental studies were conducted on two steels, AISI H 13 and AISI P 20, which are typically used in mold making industry. The experimental tests showed that a random distribution of peaks and valleys allows more homogenous material melting and gives as result a smoother surface after laser polishing...|$|R
