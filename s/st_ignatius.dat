5|$|The {{school has}} one main church, St Peter's, and five chapels: the Boys' Chapel, the Chapel of the Angels, the Sodality Chapel, the St Francis Chapel and the <b>St</b> <b>Ignatius</b> Chapel. The last two are {{both within the}} towers of St Peter's Church, and are not {{normally}} used by pupils. The Sodality Chapel {{is the home of}} the relics of the 3rd-century Roman convert St Gordianus. The Jesuits brought his remains from the College of St Omer and held them beneath the altar since 1859. His bones were temporarily removed in 2006 whilst the chapel underwent restoration, but they have since been returned. The chapel is again used by the re-established Sodality.
