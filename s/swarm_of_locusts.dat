The agents doubt his ability, but {{he is able to}} convince Mulder that he knows the latter has lost a sister—Samantha—at a young age. Mulder has been seeing visions of Samantha, and continues to see them. At Samuel's bail hearing, the courtroom fills with a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> <b>locusts,</b> which Samuel claims is a sign of God's wrath against him.|$|E
5|$|Once he is released, Samuel {{returns to}} his {{ministry}} and attempts to heal {{a woman in a}} wheelchair. However, she suffers a seizure and dies, which leads to Samuel's second arrest. An autopsy reveals the woman died of cyanide poisoning, whilst Mulder and Scully find evidence that the <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> <b>locusts,</b> which were actually common grasshoppers, was guided by someone to the courtroom through the building's ventilation system. Mulder believes Samuel to be innocent. However, the local sheriff, Maurice Daniels, allows two of his men to beat Samuel to death in his cell.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1380s, the {{governor}} of Gaza, Akbuga Safawi, plotted to commit treason against Sultan az-Zahir Barquq. The plot was detected and Safawi was exiled to al-Karak, and replaced by Husam al-Din ibn Bakish. Soon after, the city fell {{into the hands of}} Emir Yalbugha an-Nasiri who revolted against Barquq. Gaza was retaken without violence, and Ibn Bakish met Yalbugha at its gates with gifts and proposals of peace. The unseated Barquq regained his throne in 1389, and retook Gaza the next year. In 1401 a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> <b>locusts</b> destroyed Gaza's crops. A battle between the rival Mamluk emirs Akbirdi and Qansuwa Khamsiyah occurred in Gaza; Khamsiyah had failed in usurping the Mamluk throne and fled to Gaza where he made his unsuccessful last stand. Between 1428 and 1433, Gaza was governed by Emir Sayf ad-Din Inal, who would later become sultan in 1453. During his sultanate, in 1455, Inal's dawadar (executive secretary) had the Madrasa of Birdibak built in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood.|$|E

25|$|In 1986 a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress on a {{low-level}} training mission entered a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> <b>locusts.</b> The insects' {{impacts on the}} aircraft's windscreens rendered the crew unable to see, forcing them to abort the mission and fly using the aircraft's instruments alone. The aircraft eventually landed safely. In 2010 the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) issued a warning to pilots about the potential dangers of flying through a locust swarm. CASA warned that the insects could cause loss of engine power and loss of visibility, and blocking of an aircraft's pitot tubes, causing inaccurate airspeed readings.|$|E
25|$|The film {{opens with}} {{newspaper}} photojournalist Audrey Aimes (Castle) accidentally stumbling upon {{a small town}} (Ludlow, Illinois) which has been inexplicably destroyed. All 150 people in the town are missing, and the evidence indicates they are dead. Incredibly, the local fields are also barren, as if a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> <b>locusts</b> had eaten all the crops. Aimes suspects {{that the military is}} covering something up, and travels to a nearby United States Department of Agriculture experimental farm to learn what creature might have caused the agricultural destruction. She meets Dr. Ed Wainwright (Graves), who is experimenting with radiation as a means of growing gigantic fruits and vegetables to end world hunger. Dr. Wainwright reports that {{there have been a number}} of mysterious incidents nearby, and that locusts have eaten all the radioactive wheat stored in a nearby grain silo.|$|E
500|$|Although Wollstonecraft {{spends much}} of Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark musing on nature and its {{connection}} to the self, {{a great deal of}} the text is actually about the debasing effects of commerce on culture. She argues, for example, that the damage done to Hamburg and France by mercenaries and an increasingly commercial culture is far greater than the damage caused by the violence of the French revolution, writing that [...] "the sword has been merciful, compared with the depredations made on human life by contractors, and by the <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> <b>locusts</b> who have battened on the pestilence they spread abroad". Wollstonecraft believed that commerce [...] "embruted" [...] the mind and fostered a selfish disposition in its practitioners. Commerce should be, she thought, [...] "regulated by ideas of justice and fairness and directed toward the ideals of independence and benevolence".|$|E

Then persecutors and informers were let loose upon the churches, like a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> <b>locusts.</b> Many folks were terrified, and much defection prevailed.

50|$|When {{food and}} climatic {{conditions}} are favourable, huge <b>swarms</b> <b>of</b> <b>locusts</b> may develop.

6000|$|Another {{peculiarity}} {{of these}} hospital meals was the rapidity {{with which the}} edibles vanished, and the impossibility of getting a drop or crumb after the usual time. At the first ring of the bell, a general stampede took place; some twenty hungry souls rushed to the dining-room, swept over the table like a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> <b>locusts,</b> and left no fragment for any tardy creature who arrived fifteen minutes late.

This was none of your stand-up, wafery, bread and butter teas, but a thorough-going, sit-down supper, and all settled themselves with a smiling satisfaction, prophetic of great powers and an equal willingness to employ them. A detachment of half-grown girls was drawn up behind grandma, as waiters; Sylvia insisted on being one of them, and proved herself a neat-handed Phillis, though for a time slightly bewildered by the gastronomic performances she beheld. Babies ate pickles, small boys sequestered pie with a velocity that made her wink, women swam in the tea, and the men, metaphorically speaking, swept over the table like a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> <b>locusts,</b> while the host and hostess beamed upon one another and their robust descendants with an honest pride, which was beautiful to see.|$|E

They were in want themselves, but they spared the little excess of provisions that nature did not absolutely require, with the justice of the German character. There was no grinding of the poor. The word speculator was then unknown to them. I have seen many a stout man, bending under the load of the bag of meal which he was carrying from the mills of the Mohawk, through the rugged passes of these mountains, to feed his half-famished children, with a heart so light, as he approached his hut, that the thirty miles he had passed seemed nothing. Remember, my child, it was in our very infancy; we had neither mills, nor grain, nor roads, nor often clearings; we had nothing of increase but the mouths that were to be fed: for even at that inauspicious moment the restless spirit of emigration was not idle; nay, the general scarcity which extended to the East tended {{to increase the number of}} adventurers.” ...|$|E
60|$|St. Florent was now {{a melancholy}} careworn place.

It is true {{that they did not}} go back from their high resolves, or shrink from the bloody effects of their brave enterprise, but their talk now was of suffering and death; they whispered together in twos and threes, at their own door-sills, instead of shouting in the market-place. Cathelineau was dead, and Foret was dead, and they were the gallantest of their townsmen. They had now also heard that everything had been staked on a great battle, and that that battle had been lost at Cholet--that Bonchamps and d'Elbée had fallen, and that de Lescure had been wounded and was like to die. They knew that the whole army was retreating to St. Florent, and that the Republican troops would soon follow them, headed by Lechelle, whose name already drove the colour from the cheeks of every woman in La Vendée. They knew that a crowd of starving wretches would fall, like a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> <b>locusts,</b> on their already nearly empty granaries; and that all the horrors attendant on a civil war were crowding round their hearths.|$|E

60|$|It is known, my Lords, that Mr. Hastings, besides having {{received}} proposals for delivering up the beautiful country of Benares, that garden of God, {{as it is}} styled in India, to that monster, that rapacious tyrant, Asoph ul Dowlah, who with his gang of mercenary troops had desolated his own country like a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> <b>locusts,</b> had purposed likewise to seize Cheyt Sing's own patrimonial forts, which was nothing less than to take from him the residence of his women and his children, {{the seat of his}} honor, the place in which the remaining treasures and last hopes of his family were centred. By the Gentoo law, every lord or supreme magistrate is bound to construct and to live in such a fort. It is the usage of India, and is a matter of state and dignity, as well as of propriety, reason, and defence. It was probably an apprehension of being injured in this tender point, as well as a knowledge of the proposal made by the Nabob, which induced Cheyt Sing to offer to buy himself off; although it does not appear from any part of the evidence that he assigned any other reason than that of Mr. Hastings intending to exact from him six lacs of rupees over and above his other exactions.|$|E
60|$|Locusts are {{sometimes}} blown to great distances from the land. I myself caught one 370 {{miles from the}} coast of Africa, and have heard of others caught at greater distances. The Rev. R.T. Lowe informed Sir C. Lyell that in November, 1844, swarms of locusts visited the island of Madeira. They were in countless numbers, as thick as the flakes of snow in the heaviest snowstorm, and extended upward as far as could be seen with a telescope. During {{two or three days}} they slowly careered round and round in an immense ellipse, at least five or six miles in diameter, and at night alighted on the taller trees, which were completely coated with them. They then disappeared over the sea, as suddenly as they had appeared, and have not since visited the island. Now, in parts of Natal it is believed by some farmers, though on insufficient evidence, that injurious seeds are introduced into their grass-land in the dung left by the great flights of locusts which often visit that country. In consequence of this belief Mr. Weale sent me in a letter a small packet of the dried pellets, out of which I extracted under the microscope several seeds, and raised from them seven grass plants, belonging to two species, of two genera. Hence a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> <b>locusts,</b> such as that which visited Madeira, might readily be the means of introducing several kinds of plants into an island lying far from the mainland.|$|E
6000|$|But, my Lords, {{they will}} show you, they say, that Genghis Khân, Kouli Khân, and Tamerlane {{destroyed}} ten thousand times {{more people in}} battle than this man did. Good God! have they run mad? Have they lost their senses in their guilt? Did they ever expect that we meant to compare this man to Tamerlane, Genghis Khân, or Kouli Khân?--to compare a clerk at a bureau, to compare a fraudulent bullock-contractor, (for we could show that his first elementary malversations were in carrying on fraudulent bullock-contracts; which contracts were taken from him with shame and disgrace, and restored with greater shame and disgrace,) to compare him with the conquerors of the world? We never {{said he was a}} tiger and a lion: no, we have said he was a weasel and a rat. We have said that he has desolated countries by the same means that plagues of his description have produced similar desolations. We have said that he, a fraudulent bullock-contractor, exalted to great and unmerited powers, can do more mischief than even all the tigers and lions in the world. We know that a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> <b>locusts,</b> although individually despicable, can render a country more desolate than Genghis Khân or Tamerlane. When God Almighty chose to humble the pride and presumption of Pharaoh, and to bring him to shame, He did not effect His purpose with tigers and lions; but He sent lice, mice, frogs, and everything loathsome and contemptible, to pollute and destroy the country. Think of this, my Lords, and of your listening here to these people's long account of Tamerlane's camp of two hundred thousand persons, and of his building a pyramid at Bagdad with the heads of ninety thousand of his prisoners! ...|$|E
