The cover photograph showed Planet, riding bareback on a horse, with Morrison walking alongside. The gatefold and back cover photographs showed Morrison perched upon the fence of the horse's paddock, with his wife standing to his right and a black-and-white kitten on the fence to his left. [...] This rural setting depicting a bygone era was in vogue on album covers at the time as rock artists moved from cities to rural communities. [...] The Band, CSNY and Grateful Dead had similar themes on album covers in 1969 and 1970. [...] Morrison later complained of the cover, explaining that, [...] "The picture was taken at a stable and I didn't live there. We just went there and took the picture and split. A lot of people <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> album covers are your life or something." ...|$|E

Sonnet 4 clearly {{is a part of}} this group and does indeed have some references that can be taken as emotional descriptions. However, many critics <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> sonnet 4 is an exception {{in the sense that it}} points something much deeper than sexual attachments. Pequigney states that the sonnet [...] "correlate economic and carnal operations, and it abounds in inconsistencies". These inconsistencies that Pequigney mentions are things like [...] "unthrifty beauty" [...] is later then [...] "beauteous niggard" [...] and how this [...] "'profitless user' who invests large 'sums' yet cannot 'live'".

2500|$|Critics {{have accused}} Slaughterhouse-Five {{of being a}} quietist work, because Billy Pilgrim {{believes}} {{that the notion of}} free will is a quaint Earthling illusion. The problem, according to Robert Merrill and Peter A. Scholl, is that [...] "Vonnegut's critics <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he is saying the same thing [...] For Anthony Burgess, [...] "Slaughterhouse is a kind of evasion—in a sense, like J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan—in which we’re being told to carry the horror of the Dresden bombing, and everything it implies, up to a level of fantasy..." [...] For Charles Harris, [...] "The main idea emerging from Slaughterhouse-Five seems to be that the proper response to life is one of resigned acceptance." [...] For Alfred Kazin, [...] "Vonnegut deprecates any attempt to see tragedy, that day, in Dresden... He likes to say, with arch fatalism, citing one horror after another, 'So it goes.'" [...] For Tanner, [...] "Vonnegut has... total sympathy with such quietistic impulses." [...] The same notion is found throughout The Vonnegut Statement, a book of original essays written and collected by Vonnegut’s most loyal academic fans.|$|E

According to Rabbi Menachem Mendel Kasher, {{there is}} no clear {{tradition}} or Talmudic source dictating any of the preceding opinions as binding. For that reason, and consistent with a responsum of the Radbaz, Rabbi Kasher starts with the default law that a Jew not knowing the proper day for Shabbat should count days from the last time s/he observed Shabbat, and that every seven days is Shabbat. In his view, established Jewish communities are presumed to have fixed their calendars according to this principle. Therefore, Shabbat in an established community is whatever day the community has established. Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer and Rabbi Zvi Pesach Frank apparently agree with this position. This position does not in and of itself require a formal date line to be established, and Rabbi Kasher does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it is necessary to do so. But the de facto result of this position is consistent with the conventional International Date Line, at least anywhere there is an established Jewish community.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino, two {{experts in}} the field of {{academic}} dishonesty, have proposed a new way of deterring cheating that has been implemented in schools such as the University of Maryland. Modified honor codes put students in charge of the judicial hearing process, making it clear that it is the students' responsibility to stop cheating amongst themselves, {{but at the same time}} students still have proctored exams and are not allowed to take pledges of good conduct in place of professor oversight. [...] The researchers who advocate this type of code <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the normal honor code is something of a special case that is not applicable to many schools. [...] According to supporters of this system, schools with a large student body, a weak college community, or no history of student self-governance will not be able to support a full honor code. However, while modified honor codes seem to be more effective than faculty or administration run integrity codes of conduct, research shows that schools with modified codes still have higher rates of cheating than schools with full honor codes.|$|E
