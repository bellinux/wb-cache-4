5|$|In the Third Test in Cape Town, Macartney scored 44, {{before taking}} 5/44 {{in the second}} innings to ensure that Australia would only have to chase a solitary run. He bowled three of his victims and removed Billy Zulch twice. The hosts <b>struggled</b> <b>against</b> the dual spin of Macartney and Mailey. Australians went on to secure a ten-wicket victory. Macartney {{finished}} the Test series with seven wickets at 14.86. He totalled 492 runs at 70.28 and 14 wickets at 17.14 for the tour, against topping the batting averages.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{focus on}} the characters? <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> fate in Thomas Hardy?s Wessex Tales. I find that the four main characters: Matthaus Tina, Gertrude Lodge, George Barnet, and Charles Darton have some <b>struggles</b> <b>against</b> their fate. They <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> fate because they cannot accept and {{surrender}} to their fate. I decide discuss the ways the main characters <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> their fate as my topic. I {{need to use the}} literary approach and employ the literary theory especially the theory of conflict as the main tool to analyze the situations that show the characters? <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> fate. In addition, I also use the theory of characterization to analyze the characters? thinking or action as their struggles when they fight against fate. Finally, as my finding, I see the four main characters <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> fate but they cannot fight against fate. The important point is not the result of their struggle but their struggles and willingness to fight against fate. When they <b>struggle</b> <b>against</b> fate, they prove that {{they do not want to}} surrender to their fate...|$|R

Wiltord replaced Robert Pirès {{in the second half}} and scored twice to settle the match. In the sixth round, Arsenal enjoyed a comfortable win against Blackburn Rovers of the First Division, where Wiltord continued his run scoring in each round of the competition.|$|E
5|$|Most capable Soviet tank at Kursk was the T-34, the {{original}} version was armed with a 76.2mm gun, the gun <b>struggled</b> <b>against</b> uparmoured Panzer IVs, and the frontal armour of Tigers and Panthers was essentially impenetrable.

5|$|Australia <b>struggled</b> <b>against</b> the new ball in {{the first}} {{hour of the day}} three. Miller played and missed three times in one over before being trapped lbw for 31; the {{tourists}} added only nine runs in the first hour. Four runs later, Morris reached 51 and fell to Bedser, leaving Australia at 5/139. It had been a slow morning for Morris—he took 21 minutes to add a single to his overnight total and reached 50 after taking another 24 minutes to register his second run of the day. Australia fell for 221, narrowly avoiding the follow on, and England declared at 3/174 on the last morning after many rain delays. This left Bradman’s team with a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire morning was lost.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} morning, Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand ended with Hassett's fall for 37. The {{following}} four batsmen {{were unable to}} establish themselves at the crease and none passed 20. Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving; it took a run out to remove Morris. Australia were eventually out for 389. Morris had scored {{more than half the}} runs {{as the rest of the}} team <b>struggled</b> <b>against</b> the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. England had relied heavily on spin; two thirds of the overs were delivered by the two spinners.|$|E

The Sabres entered the 2010 playoffs as the third seed in the Eastern Conference. They were eliminated in the first round by the Boston Bruins. Torres' play <b>struggled</b> <b>against</b> the Bruins and he was benched for the final two games of the series. He recorded two assists over four playoff games.|$|E
5|$|The {{match against}} Scotland was a two-day fixture {{that did not}} have {{first-class}} status. Australia elected to bat and Morris top-scored with 112, and McCool made 52, but all <b>struggled</b> <b>against</b> the leg-spin of William Laidlaw, who took 5/51. The Australians collapsed at the end, losing their last six wickets for 36 runs, and only three made double figures. Scotland collapsed against Johnston and Johnson, who took 6/15 and 3/18 respectively. Forced to follow on, a second innings opening stand of 50 preceded a second collapse, this time Ring and Morris took 4/20 and 5/10. Only three Scottish players passed double figures in either innings.|$|E
5|$|The {{region has}} been a {{prominent}} spice exporter since 3000BCE. The Chera Dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala, though it frequently <b>struggled</b> <b>against</b> attacks by the neighbouring Cholas and Pandyas. In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and {{paved the way for}} the European colonisation of India. At the time of Indian independence, there were two major princely states in Kerala - Travancore and Kochi. They united to form Thirukochi. The Malabar region, in the north part of present-day Kerala was under the Madras province of British India. In 1956, Kerala state was formed by merging Malabar district, Travancore-Cochin (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district), and the taluk of Kasaragod (now Kasaragod District), South Kanara (Tulunad).|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Dolly was a {{short-lived}} and disorganized tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage across Tamaulipas, Mexico, in early September2014. Originating from a tropical wave, the system first became a tropical depression late on September1 while situated over the Bay of Campeche. Dolly <b>struggled</b> <b>against</b> strong wind shear {{for the duration}} of its existence. The large system featured multiple circulations, sometimes becoming a new dominant center and other times simply rotating around a mean vortex. As a result, multiple center relocations occurred along its general west-northwest track. Dolly eventually made landfall in Tamaulipas on September3 before degenerating into a remnant low. The system subsequently dissipated the following day.|$|E
5|$|When the Tests {{started at}} Trent Bridge, Davidson was {{named in the}} playing XI. He {{supported}} the pace attack of Miller, Lindwall and Johnston in the five Tests. His debut in the First Test was unremarkable. As with most of Australia's batsmen, Davidson <b>struggled</b> <b>against</b> Alec Bedser, who broke the English Test wicket-taking record in the wet conditions, making only four and six. He took 2/22 in the first innings as the match ended in a rain affected draw. His first Test wicket was that of Hutton, caught by Benaud, and he added Evans {{in the latter part}} of the innings.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{elected to}} bat, and Miller, {{who had been}} {{promoted}} to No. 3, shared century partnerships with Barnes (78) and Bradman (81). A middle-order collapse then ensued as the remaining Australians <b>struggled</b> <b>against</b> the local spin attack, but last man Johnston managed to hold up his end in a 37-run last-wicket partnership that allowed Miller to reach his double century. He ended on 202 not out as Australia were dismissed for 448. The Australian-born slow bowler Vic Jackson was the best Leicestershire bowler, taking 5/91. Leicestershire scored only 130 in their first innings; another Australian expatriate, Jack Walsh, top-scored with 33. Ring took 5/34 and the hosts hampered their batting efforts with two run outs. Australia enforced the follow on and Leicestershire faced {{the prospect of being}} bowled out twice in a day after Johnson took the first wickets to have them 5/83. After a rain delay Australia took the final five wickets for 34 runs in an hour on the final day; Leicestershire were all out for 147 in an innings defeat. Johnson ended with 7/42.|$|E

5|$|Bradman {{initially}} <b>struggled</b> <b>against</b> the English bowling. He faced {{his first}} ball from Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving a loud appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling {{from the other}} end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and one ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first 20 minutes and Australia had scored only 14 after the first 30 minutes. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the strip ended in March 1995 Melchester were in dire straits, {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy, and their {{long-term}} future far from certain. When the strip returned in Match of the Day magazine in May 1997, much of the monthly comic's new continuity was ignored, although the basic thread of the club having <b>struggled</b> <b>against</b> relegation and being severely in debt was continued. It was revealed in the first strip that in the intervening years, while Rovers had managed to survive the threat of bankruptcy, a bribery scandal had caused a mass exodus of players and eventual relegation to Division One. Rocky, meanwhile, was playing for fierce local rivals Melborough, after a bitter falling-out with his father over a car accident in Italy in which his mother, Penny, had been killed. Roy, who had quit football as a result, was blamed by some (including his son) for the accident, even though he had no memory of it, and the precise circumstances surrounding the event were never resolved.|$|E
5|$|During {{their first}} three seasons the Panthers played in {{regional}} leagues, {{first in the}} English League South and then in Section B of the British Hockey League. In 1983 the British Hockey League reconstituted itself into the first truly national ice hockey league for 23 years and Nottingham became one of nine founder members of the league's Premier Division. The Panthers {{were one of the}} best supported teams in the league with games regularly selling out but success on the ice eluded them as the team <b>struggled</b> <b>against</b> more established opponents such as the Durham Wasps and the Murrayfield Racers. It was not until the appointment of Alex Dampier as coach in 1985 that the team's fortunes began to change. In his first season Dampier led Nottingham to the playoffs {{for the first time since}} reforming. The Panthers lost all four of their quarter final group games and failed to advance to the finals at Wembley Arena.|$|E
