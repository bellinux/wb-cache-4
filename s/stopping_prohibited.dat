40|$|Because of {{the tight}} {{constraints}} on many streets in urban areas, {{it is not}} uncommon to situate a bus stop upstream of a signal-controlled intersection without the provision of a proper bus bay or setback. For a single-lane approach, where the overtaking of a stopped bus at the bus <b>stop</b> is <b>prohibited,</b> the setup of such a bus stop would significantly affect the delay incurred by road users. It is believed that the delay in such situations depends on a number of factors, such as the distance between bus stop and stop line, traffic and bus flows, dwell time of buses and signal settings. In this paper, a simulation model for estimating the delay on an approach to a signal-controlled intersection with a bus stop upstream is developed. To test the reliability of the model, field surveys were conducted to validate the simulation model. A good agreement between the observed and simulation results was obtained. When the simulation model was used, a new delay formula was established and calibrated for use in the design of a signal-controlled intersection. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Terconazole binds to the heme iron {{component}} on the cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol of fungi, {{also known}} as CYP3A4. The gene ERG11 controls lanosterol creation. Lanosterol is found within the yeast plasma membrane. It is a class of methylsterol. Within a normal yeast cell, lanosterol is demethylated using 14α-demethylation. This process creates zymosterol: a major constituent in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway {{for the creation of}} cell membrane constituents in yeast. This structure provides the membrane with fluidity. This occurs by transforming lanosterol into 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-β-ol. This <b>stops</b> respiration by <b>prohibiting</b> reduction of NADH to NAD. This stops biosynthesis of cell membrane products as well as transport and catabolism. Eventually, membrane fluidity and activity of membrane bound enzymes become depleted. It has also been shown to inhibit morphologic change of yeast as well as cell adherence and is directly toxic to yeast. Terconazole targets fungi specifically since humans do not use lanosterol in this pathway. This process does not affect all fungi such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, which lacks lanosterol.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} set of hockey rules (1886) the use of hands and feet was {{permitted}} to stop the ball; the use of feet was outlawed in 1938 but hands could still be used to stop the ball. As such, a hand stop became a large part of early penalty corners; one player would inject, a second would hand stop and the third would shoot. In 1961, the number of defenders behind the goalline was reduced to six; the remainder had to stand beyond the 25-yard line and two years later this became the halfway line. There were too many goals from penalty corners {{and the use of the}} hands to stop the ball, and thus the hand <b>stop,</b> were <b>prohibited</b> from 1982; a result was that the same player at a penalty corner would stop and strike the ball. A few years later, in 1987, the number of defenders was reduced to the current quota of five. Additionally, it was required that the first hit at goal could must cross the goalline at a height no greater than 18 in for a goal to be awarded [...] - [...] this rule ceased to apply once the ball had travelled more than 5 yards outside the penalty circle. In 1995, the location where the ball was injected from was fixed at 10 yards from goal (as opposed to the previous rule which stated it must be at least 10 yards) [...] - [...] a specific mark inside the circle was introduced in 2000. Additionally, in 1995 substitutions were permitted at penalty corners. This rule caused the development of specialist penalty corner takers who just came on for this and was abolished three years later. In 1996, a penalty corner required that the ball was stopped outside the circle before a goal could be scored. From 2003, it did not need to be stopped but did have to travel outside the circle.|$|R

Each day 20,000 private cars pass through area around Avenida Jalisco as well, with a total of about 850,000 vehicles. In October 2009, the government worked to remove the nearly 1,000 peddlers who set up stands here, blocking sidewalks and streets. However, neighbors say this is impossible to do permanently since the peddlers need to earn money. Even without the vendors the traffic situation is chaotic with busses lining up on the street waiting for passengers and blocking lanes and intersections and with piles of garbage on the streets. Buses and taxis park and <b>stop</b> illegally in <b>prohibited</b> areas because there are too many for the police to control.

He resolved then to become a Latin surgeon as a teenager, {{going to the hospital}} San Andres Hospital in search of training in anatomy. His best training came from Hipolito Unanue, who later became the most renowned physician in Peru at the time. In 1788, Valdes obtained his degree as a [...] "Latin" [...] Surgeon, authorizing him to perform emergency surgery. Through unparalleled skill in his practice, he obtained brilliant testimonials to his work from Juan de la Roca and Hipolito Unanue. He uses these to gain special permission from the supreme Peruvian authority on medicine at the time, the Protomedico, who granted him the permission to practice medical cures for one year only. Valdes' practice proved so skillful and valuable, that he remained in operation as a surgeon for over fifteen years. He began accumulating wealth and bought a house, to which he brought his mother, his sister, Maria de Pilar, and his godmother, the widow of the pharmacist. His patients were the members of the highest ranking families in Peru. Though Vales was well acquainted with many well to do families, his mulatto status prevented him from being able to seek any companion, and To fill the gap in his life, he delved deeply into his profession, importing only the most modern books from Europe, and the best medical instruments. After 1791. he began collaborating on the Mercurio Peruano. In 1793, Valdes published his dissertation on the method of curing dysentery.|$|R

40|$|Exposure to {{secondhand smoke}} (SHS) is harmful and {{hazardous}} {{to the health}} of the general public. A large body of research has been conducted in this topic, and great efforts have been made to prevent people from being exposed to SHS. Legislation on restricting smoking in workplaces and many public places has also been increasing. However, tobacco industries have been fighting against smoking bans in restaurants and bars with multiple strategies, which has led to the current situation that smoking bans in restaurants and bars usually lag behind other environments in many countries. As of January 2012, a total of 66 nations worldwide have enacted a 100 % smoke-free law in workplaces and hospitality venues, while only 46 of the 66 include both restaurants and bars, and more than 90 % of the world population can't enjoy smoke-free restaurants and bars. In addition, tobacco industries have made continuing efforts to remove existing smoking bans, and such efforts are sometimes successful. For example, as of October 2011, 15 U. S. municipalities that had adopted effective smoke-free laws subsequently repealed, weakened, or postponed them due to such efforts. This dissertation aims to quantify SHS exposure and the attendant health risks, morbidity and mortality, among restaurant and bar servers and patrons, to provide scientific evidence on whether SHS exposure in restaurants and bars can be ignored and whether restaurants and bars should be exempted from smoking bans. The dissertation consists of seven chapters. Chapter 1 presents the general background, Chapters 2 and 3 focus on quantifying SHS exposure in restaurants and bars by workers and patrons; Chapter 4 evaluates the efficacy of different smoking policies adopted to reduce SHS exposure in restaurants and bars in Beijing China; and Chapters 5 and 6 assess the excess heath risks, morbidity and mortality, due to SHS exposure in restaurants and bars, and the last chapter summarizes the findings and conclusions from the previous five chapters. The study in Chapter 2 applies multiple approaches to assess restaurant and bar servers' and patrons' exposure to SHS two years after the implementation of the governmental smoking restriction in Beijing, 2010. Of the 79 restaurants and bars monitored in the study, 37 (47 %) nominally prohibited smoking, and 14 (18 %) restricted smoking to designated sections. A total of 121 visits were made during peak-patronage times, and smoking was observed in 26 (51 %) of these nominal nonsmoking venues or sections. Patrons were exposed to a median (interquartile range IQR) of 27 (4 - 93) µg/m 3 of fine particulates derived from SHS (SHS PM) and a median (IQR) of 1. 53 (0. 69 - 3. 10) µg/m 3 of airborne nicotine during their visits. For servers, continuous real-time sampling of SHS PM and sequential area sampling of airborne nicotine, for more than 24 hours in two restaurants, showed obvious spikes of SHS concentrations during peak-patronage times, and SHS concentrations remained high during intervals between peak-patronage times or in evenings due to staff smoking. Servers were exposed to a median (IQR) of 2. 62 (1. 22 - 5. 40) µg/m 3 of airborne nicotine during their day-time working hours by one-day active personal sampling, and 1. 83 (0. 92 - 3. 21) µg/m 3 of airborne nicotine during a whole week by week-long passive sampling. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis rank tests of SHS concentrations by different nominal smoking policies showed statistically significant difference of peak-patronage-time SHS PM and airborne nicotine concentrations, while no statistically significant differences of one-day average nicotine concentration by active area or personal sampling, or of week-long average nicotine concentration by passive sampling. Comparison of results by different sampling approaches showed that both measured SHS PM and airborne nicotine concentrations were significantly related to observed active smoker activities. A slope of 17 µg/m 3 of SHS PM per one µg/m 3 of nicotine was observed. Time-weighted nicotine concentrations by one-hour peak-patronage time area sampling were higher than those by one-day area sampling and by week-long area sampling; and results of peak-patronage-time sampling could explain about half of the variance of the results by the latter two sampling approaches. One-hour peak-patronage-time area nicotine sampling results were very close to one-day personal nicotine sampling results. Thus, peak-time area sampling is a feasible and also a reasonably accurate way to access patrons' exposure to SHS during their short-term visits and servers' exposure during their full shifts. Chapter 3 develops and evaluates a mass balance model to predict SHS concentrations in restaurants and bars in China during peak-patronage times. The model is based on field data from an intensive study, with field monitoring of SHS concentrations in a representative sample of Minnesota restaurants and bars during representative peak-patronage times, and field data from existing studies of Chinese restaurants and bars. The model could predict SHS PM concentrations reasonably well, but not so well for airborne nicotine concentrations. Using the model and Monte Carlo simulation, the mean (SD) of simulated SHS PM concentrations was predicted to be 135 (182) &# 956;g/m 3, 90 (129) &# 956;g/m 3, and 49 (79) &# 956;g/m 3 in restaurants with smoking allowed everywhere, designated smoking sections of restaurants, and designated nonsmoking restaurants, respectively. Predicted SHS concentrations in bars were about two times as in restaurants with the same smoking policy. These predicted concentrations were used to assess the health risks for both servers and patrons in Chapter 6. Chapter 4 uses field data collected in three previous studies from 2006 to 2008 and the study conducted in 2010, which is presented in Chapter 2, to evaluate the efficacy of different smoking policies adopted in Beijing restaurants and bars during this time period. There were significant overlaps of sampling venues included in each year. In 2006, all voluntary smoking bans in restaurants and bars were completely self-motivated by owners, and in 2007, they were encouraged by the government. Less than 20 % of restaurants and bars prohibited or restricted smoking in 2006 or 2007. This indicates that both the self-motivated and governmental encouraged voluntary smoking bans are rarely adopted; thus, voluntary smoking bans cannot protect people from SHS exposure in restaurants and bars. When the Beijing government started to require smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars in 2008, more than 80 % of venues did so as required; in these venues, the active smoking rate of patrons decreased, while no significant changes were observed in venues without any policy changes. However, some venues <b>stopped</b> <b>prohibiting</b> or restricting smoking two years later in 2010, resulting in less than 60 % restaurants and bars nominally prohibited or restricted smoking, showing non-continuous enforcement by the government and decreasing compliance by venue owners. Though SHS PM concentrations in Beijing restaurants and bars decreased after the governmental smoking restriction in both 2008 and 2010, compared to those in 2006 and 2007, this happened in all the venues followed up with, regardless of the policy changes. In 2010, two years after the smoking restrictions, both SHS PM concentrations and active smoking rates in restaurants and bars were higher than in 2008, regardless of the changes in smoking policy. The similarity of SHS levels experienced by servers of restaurants and bars with different nominal smoking policies during their full shifts in 2010 also showed poor enforcement and compliance of the restrictions two years after the implementation. Chapters 5 and 6 estimate the health risks and excess morbidity and mortality caused by SHS exposure in restaurants and bars in Minnesota, in the U. S., and in China. Intensive field monitoring of SHS exposure in a representative sample of 65 Minnesota restaurants and bars, for multiple times in each venue, showed that more than 80 % of patrons were exposed to SHS concentrations above the threshold of eye and nasal irritation during more than 80 % of their visits. Patrons' and servers' lifetime excess risk (LER) of lung cancer death (LCD) due to SHS exposure in restaurants and bars in both Minnesota and in China was well above the acceptable level of 1 × 10 - 6. And this was true even for patrons who visited designated nonsmoking sections only for about 1. 5 hours a week in their lifetime. The LER can be much higher for patrons who visit restaurants and bars more often, or for patrons who also visit smoking sections or venues allowing smoking everywhere. As for servers, their LER of LCD or asthma initiation (estimated for Minnesota and U. S. restaurant and bar servers only) could be higher than the significant risk of 1 × 10 - 3, considered an unsafe level by the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). In the population level, SHS exposure in restaurants and bars was estimated to cause three LCDs and 32 ischaemic heart disease (IHD) deaths per year among the general nonsmoking population, and 53 new asthma cases per year among nonsmoking servers in Minnesota, 214 LCDs and 3001 IHD deaths per year among the general nonsmoking population, and 1420 new asthma cases per year among nonsmoking servers in the U. S. This death toll was predicted to be 1325 LCDs and 1525 IHD deaths a year in China. In all, restaurants and bars are major employers, and they are also important public places for the general population. This dissertation shows that both servers and patrons are exposed to high concentrations of SHS in restaurants and bars, and the attendant health risks, morbidity, and mortality are too significant to be ignored. Thus, to protect people from the health hazards of SHS exposure, restaurants and bars should not be exempted from any smoking bans. The only effective way is to create 100 % smoke-free environments by comprehensive smoking bans, and just passing a smoking ban is not enough, while full enforcement and compliance is extremely important...|$|R
40|$|Portable (roll-out) {{stop signs}} are used at school {{crossings}} in over 300 cities in Iowa. Their use {{conforms to the}} Code of Iowa, {{although it is not}} consistent with the provisions of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted for nationwide application. A survey indicated that most users in Iowa believe that portable stop signs provide effective protection at school crossings, and favor their continued use. Other non-uniform signs that fold or rotate to display a STOP message only during certain hours are used at school crossings in over 60 cities in Iowa. Their use does not conform to either the Code of Iowa or the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Users of these devices also tend to favor their continued use. A survey of other states indicated that use of temporary devices similar to those used in Iowa is not generally sanctioned. Some unsanctioned use apparently occurs in several states, however. A different type of portable stop sign for school crossings is authorized and widely used in one state. Portable stop signs similar to those used in Iowa are authorized in another state, although their use is quite limited. A few reports in the literature reviewed for this research discussed the use of portable stop signs. The authors of these reports uniformly recommended against the use of portable or temporary traffic control devices. Various reasons for this recommendation were given, although data to support the recommendation were not offered. As part of this research, field surveys were conducted at 54 locations in 33 communities where temporary stop control devices were in use at school crossings. Research personnel observed the obedience to stop control and measured the vehicular delay incurred. Stopped delay averaged 1. 89 seconds/entering vehicle. Only 36. 6 percent of the vehicles were observed to come to a complete stop at the study locations controlled by temporary stop control devices. However, this level of obedience does not differ from that observed at intersections controlled by permanent stop signs. Accident experience was compiled for 76 intersections in 33 communities in Iowa where temporary stop signs were used and, for comparative purposes, at 76 comparable intersections having other forms of control or operating without stop control. There {{were no significant differences in}} accident experience An economic analysis of vehicle operating costs, delay costs, and other costs indicated that temporary stop control generated costs only about 12 percent as great as permanent stop control for a street having a school crossing. Midblock pedestrian-actuated signals were shown to be cost effective in comparison with temporary stop signs under the conditions of use assumed. Such signals could be used effectively at a number of locations where temporary stop signs are being used. The results of this research do not provide a basis for recommending that use of portable <b>stop</b> signs be <b>prohibited.</b> However, erratic patterns of use of these devices and inadequate designs suggest that improved standards for their use are needed. Accordingly, nine recommendations are presented to enhance the efficiency of vehicular flow at school crossings, without causing a decline in the level of pedestrian protection being afforded...|$|R
