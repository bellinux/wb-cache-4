Full details on how to obtain expressions for the orthogonal polynomials and the relationship between the coefficients b and a are given by Guest. [...] Expressions for the convolution coefficients are easily obtained because the normal equations matrix, JTJ, is a diagonal matrix as the product of any two orthogonal polynomials is zero by virtue of their mutual orthogonality. Therefore, each non-zero element of its inverse is simply the reciprocal the corresponding element in the normal equation matrix. The calculation is further simplified by using recursion to build orthogonal Gram polynomials. The whole calculation can be coded in a few lines of PASCAL, a computer language well-adapted for calculations involving recursion.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Farmers and {{researchers}} {{are aware of}} spatial variation in grain yield within farms or fields. Fertilizer management may be improved if techniques can be developed to identify grain yield variations in wheat fields. Aerial color infrared (CIR) photography was used to identify winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) canopy biomass variability in the Spring of the growing season. Low yielding areas identified from CIR photography were associated with shallow soil profiles consistent with soil forming factors of the region, and were significantly different from average and high yielding areas. The high yielding areas were located within a few meters of a drainage way, and {{were not significantly different}} than the average yielding areas except in one field with a deep soil profile and low variance. Fields with heterogeneous CIR photographs had high variances because of many dissimilar inclusions. CIR photography, although useful to distinguish vegetational differences, requires complex timing, ground verification, and correction to estimate yield variability. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to overlay photo interpreted biomass and soil map units. The overlay analysis allowed construction of a higher (first) order soil map indicating inclusions. Area calculation of the inclusions and map units using a GIS function combined with estimated yield (no variance estimates or confidence intervals associated with the estimated yield) data suggests fertilizer management with a first order soil map to increase fertilizer efficiency by up to six percent. Future research combining remotely-sensed <b>subsidiary</b> <b>variables</b> correlated with moisture supply capacity estimates from soil survey methods may assess, using relatively new spatially dependent interpolation methods, the local and regional variation in wheat grain yield...|$|R

40|$|This book {{introduces}} {{new concepts}} {{at the intersection}} of machine learning, causal inference and philosophy of science: the macrovariable cause and effect. Methods for learning such from microvariable data are introduced. The learning process proposes a minimal number of guided experiments that recover the macrovariable cause from observational data. Mathematical definitions of a micro- and macro- scale manipulation, an observational and causal partition, and a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>variable</b> are given. These concepts provide a link to previous work in causal inference and machine learning. The main theoretical result is the Causal Coarsening Theorem, a new insight into the measure-theoretic structure of probability spaces and structural equation models. The theorem provides grounds for automatic causal hypothesis formation from data. Other results concern the minimality and sufficiency of representations created in accordance with the theorem. Finally, this book proposes the first algorithms for supervised and unsupervised causal macrovariable discovery. These algorithms bridge large-scale, multidimensional machine learning and causal inference. In an application to climate science, the algorithms re-discover a known causal mechanism as a viable causal hypothesis. In a psychophysical experiment, the algorithms learn to minimally change visual stimuli to achieve a desired effect on human perception. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore to what extent the {{community}} and family factors such as spousal adjustment and children???s education are related to the international adjustment of expatriates, and to examine to what extent the demographic factors of expatriates are associated with these non-work factors and expatriate adjustment. 	This study followed the exploratory quantitative research approach, and data collection adopted a cross-sectional survey design which gathered information on a population from March of 2011 to October of 2010. The population in this study consists of Korean expatriates who have been sent overseas from Korean MNCs, as well as Korean expatriates who have been repatriated to Korea whose headquarters are located in Korea. The survey was completed by 120 Korean expatriates who work for American branches of three major Korean multinational corporations X, Y, and Z, purposely selected as the sample. The data was analyzed using stepwise multiple regressions in order to account for the correlations between various demographic variables and the variables of research interest and to avoid any effects due to the order of data entry. 	This study contributed to the field of the Human Resource Development by focusing on the following non-work factors. First, this topic focused on communities which have not been much studied in expatriate adjustment. Second, this topic focused on distinguishing different types of communities that facilitate expatriate adjustment. Finally, this study found that family factors, including spousal adjustment and children???s early education abroad have an important relationship with expatriate adjustment. 	The key findings of the current study indicated that cultural similarity had a significant positive relationship with overall adjustment, as well as all the <b>subsidiary</b> <b>variables</b> of expatriate adjustment. In other words, the less expatriates perceived cultural differences the more they felt adjusted. Cultural novelty was especially identified as having the most variance in host national interaction and the least in work adjustment. The results were consistent with many previous studies by suggesting that expatriate adjustment is more difficult when the host culture is more different or distant. Another finding is that spousal adjustment had the most significant relationship among all the independent variables with each of the subsidiary dimensions of expatriate adjustment. In particular, spousal adjustment had the strongest effect on the general environment of expatriates, followed by host national interaction, and finally, work adjustment. This finding was noteworthy in that it confirmed the findings of previous research and showed that the role of family was stable in changing times. Children???s early study abroad was confirmed as adding to the context of the adjustment of Korean expatriates who have foreign assignments in the United States. It is noteworthy that children???s schooling, social life, and English development were highly related to the general environment, interaction and work adjustment of expatriates. However, both the preference for children???s education in the United States and the intention to be expatriated for children???s education were not related to expatriate adjustment. A sense of community turned out to have little influence on expatriates??? adjustment in this study.

Pentoxifylline, an {{inhibitor}} of tumor necrosis factor, {{has been}} evaluated as an antimalarial agent {{in combination with}} artesunate in 45 patients with severe falciparum malaria. Patients were admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Bangkok, Thailand, and randomly assigned to treatment for 72 hr with a combination of intravenously administered artesunate and 1) placebo, 2) low-dose pentoxifylline (0. 83 mg/kg/hr), or 3) high-dose pentoxifylline (1. 67 mg/kg/hr). All 45 patients had one or more manifestations of severe malaria such as cerebral malaria (n 5 18), renal failure requiring hemodialysis (n 5 9), azotemia (n 5 8), jaundice (n 5 25), or hyperparasitemia (n 5 30). The overall severity was comparable in the three groups. Clinical outcome was assessed with respect to the parasite clearance time and the fever clearance time in all patients. In addition, a number of <b>subsidiary</b> outcome <b>variables</b> were examined in specific subgroups, including the recovery time from coma for patients with cerebral malaria, the duration of intubation in patients with respiratory distress, the number of hemodialysis treatments needed for patients with acute renal failure, and the number of units of blood administered to patients requiring transfusion.

The significant differences between perceptions of superintendents, principals, assistant principals, deans, counselors, and teachers regarding discipline problems in selected Illinois public high schools were investigated. Results from a questionnaire concerning high school discipline were received from 688 educators in 103 high schools. The study was descriptive in nature and was composed of three parts. The first part described the demographic characteristics of the 688 respondents and their respective high schools. Part II contained results of the chi-square analyses of the data regarding perceptions of the respondents and ten research questions. A. 05 level of significance was used to test the null hypotheses. Part III discussed findings from previous studies as they compared to this study. Statistically significant differences were found in eight of the ten hypotheses and between <b>subsidiary</b> demographic <b>variables</b> of male teachers and administrators and respondents from small high schools. Failure to do homework was perceived as the most frequent and disobeying the teacher as the most serious discipline problems occurring in the high school classrooms.

40|$|Purpose - A major {{challenge}} faced by MNCs {{is how to}} manage knowledge transfer between headquarters and subsidiaries located in dissimilar cultural contexts. While the impact of culture on knowledge transfer has been widely acknowledged, an important {{gap in the literature}} is how cultural distance (external <b>variable)</b> and <b>subsidiary</b> roles (internal <b>variable)</b> interact in impacting on knowledge flows in MNCs. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present an integrative model to advance understanding of the interaction between cultural distance and subsidiary roles in the knowledge transfer process within MNCs. Design/methodology/approach - An environment-strategy-performance framework is developed based on a review of extant literature. A case study is used to substantiate the framework. It was conducted in an MNC in China and involved in-depth interviews with expatriate and local managers. Findings - Knowledge transfer in MNCs is influenced by external context (cultural distance) and internal mechanisms (subsidiary roles). The direction and magnitude of knowledge flows is related to the strategic roles of the subsidiary and is influenced by cultural distance. Negative impacts are evident where cultural distance is large, with positive impacts where cultural synergies occur. Changes in Chinese cultural values impacting on knowledge transfer are also evident. Originality/value - The conceptual model combines internal resource and external environmental perspectives. It links literature on cross-cultural management, subsidiary roles and MNC knowledge transfer. Furthermore, it explores linkages between culture and knowledge transfer, cultural distance and subsidiary roles, knowledge transfer and subsidiary roles. The model is operationalised in a China-based case study. 21 page(s...|$|R

The UG 2 consists of a 66 cm main seam and, ca 5 m above the UG 2, four subsidiary seams with a combined thickness of 30 cm. The UG 1 consists of a 112 cm main seam and, in its hanging- and foot wall, 50 subsidiary seams/stringers with a combined thickness of 91 cm. The UG 2 main seam contains 2111 ppb Pt, 1214 ppb Pd, 362 ppb Ru, and 98 ppb Ir, with the subsidiary seams containing broadly similar PGE levels. The UG 1 main seam contains 628 ppb Pt, 265 ppb Ru, and 45 ppb Ir over 112 cm, but only 13 ppb Pd. The <b>subsidiary</b> seams have <b>variable</b> compositions broadly overlapping with the main seam. Well defined positive correlations between Pt and Pd with the IPGE suggest that in the chromitites the PGE were originally concentrated by a sulfide liquid. In both the UG 2 and the UG 1 chromitites the highest PGE contents occur {{at the top and}} bottom of the seams, analogous to other localities in the Bushveld Complex. Such element distribution patterns resemble those in certain dykes interpreted to result from flow differentiation, suggesting that the seams formed via injection of chromite slurries into their semi-consolidated footwall cumulates, possibly during sagging of the centre of the complex in response to emptying of staging chambers at depth. Down-dip sliding of the semi-consolidated cumulates was also responsible for the phase layering of the chromitites, as represented by the sharp top and bottom contacts of the seams, and the extremely well defined correlation between PGE and chromitites. One of the last processes during cumulate solidification involved removal of some of the sulfur from the chromitites by late magmatic and/or hydrothermal fluids. Pd and Cu have also been mobilized locally (particularly in the UG 1 chromitite), but the other PGE appear to have been largely immobile...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the {{preparation}} of new nickel(II) complexes with N/S donor ligands and their mixed complexes with co-ligands. A number of nickel(II) complexes of thiosemicarbazone derivatives of 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzaldehyde and thiourea derivatives of diamines have been synthesized and characterized by a combination of spectroscopic studies, elemental analysis, and X-ray crystallography. Five series of nickel(II) complexes with thiosemicarbazone ligands of the type H 3 L (RCH=NNHC = 2, 3 -dihyd = H; H 3 L 1, CH 3; H 3 L 2, C 6 H 5; H 3 L 3, C 2 H 5; H 3 L 4) have been verified by means of IR, NMR and, in some cases, X-ray crystallography. These five series of nickel(II) thiosemicarbazone complexes have been prepared by using different starting nickel(II) compounds, Ni(ClO 4) 2. 6 H 2 O, [NiCl 2 (Bpy) ], Ni(OAc) 2. 4 H 2 O, [NiCl 2 (PPh 3) 2] and NiCl 2 with dppe, giving complexes with the formula [Ni(H 3 L) (H 2 L) ]ClO 4, [Ni(H 2 L) 2][Ni(H 3 L) 2]Cl 2, [Ni 2 (HL) 2], ([Ni(H 2 L) (PPh 3) ]Cl, [Ni(HL) (PPh 3) ]) and [Ni 2 (HL) 2 (dppe) ] respectively. Results from spectroscopic data and crystal structure analysis show that in all complexes the thiosemicarbazone ligands coordinate as tridentate ONS donors in different coordination modes. The complexes [Ni(H 3 L) (H 2 L) ]ClO 4 and [Ni(H 2 L) ][Ni(H 3 L) ]Cl 2 are octahedral with two thiosemicarbazone ligands coordinating as neutral H 3 L and monodeprotonated H 2 L ligand whereas the complexes [Ni 2 (HL) 2], ([Ni(H 2 L) (PPh 3) ]Cl, [Ni(HL) (PPh 3) ]) and [Ni 2 (HL) 2 (dppe) ] are square planar with the thiosemicarbazone ligand coordinating as doubly deprotonated HL in [Ni 2 (HL) 2], [Ni(HL) (PPh 3) ], [Ni 2 (HL) 2 (dppe) ] and as monodeprotonated H 2 L in ([Ni(H 2 L) (PPh 3) ]Cl. phenyl, o-phenylamine, p-phenylamine and o-aminopyridine) have been prepared and characterized. Thiourea diamine ligands have been coordinated to nickel(II) and the differing binding modes of the ligands in the absence and presence of co-ligands have been investigated. The reaction of the thiourea ligands with nickel(II) salts yields mononuclear diamagnetic complexes with thiourea ligand coordinates as bidentate NS donors, while the reaction of nickel salts with the thiourea ligands in the presence of 1, 10 -phenanthroline or 2, 2 '-bipyridine affords binuclear paramagnetic complexes with the thiourea ligands coordinating as tridentate NNS donors. With the aim of evaluating the effect of varying N 4 substitution from methyl, ethyl to phenyl in thiosemicarbazone moiety and the coordination environments for nickel complexes with thiosemicarbazones ligands on biological activities, DNA topoisomerase inhibition assay has been carried out. The results from this study showed that the ability of the complex to inhibit the enzyme strengthened as the ligands become more hydrophobic and the coordination environment around the nickel ion is square planar.
