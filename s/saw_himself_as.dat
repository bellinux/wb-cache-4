5|$|The Duke of Wellington was {{becoming}} unpopular as Prime Minister, {{particularly in the}} industrial north west of England, for continually blocking proposed reforms. Huskisson <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> well placed to unite the two wings of the Tory party should the Duke retire, or to lead the reforming faction of the party into a split from the Tories and a progressive alliance with the Whigs. He also <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a natural ally for the Duke, despite their political differences, as a Tory popular in Liverpool and Manchester, {{both of which were}} traditionally hostile to the party. Newspapers were already beginning to report rumours that Huskisson and his supporters were to be invited back into the government.|$|E
5|$|Orozco, who <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> being {{instrumental}} in Madero's victory over Díaz, was merely appointed as a {{commander of the}} rurales in Chihuahua, which increased his resentment. When he tried {{to run for governor}} of the state, Madero supported his opponent, Abraham González and eventually pressured Orozco {{to drop out of the}} race. When, in the aftermath of the Plan of Ayala, Madero ordered Orozco to lead federal troops to suppress Zapata, Orozco refused. In March 1912, Orozco issued his Plan of Empacadora and formally declared himself in rebellion against Madero.|$|E
5|$|Castro stockpiled {{weapons for}} a planned {{attack on the}} Moncada Barracks, a {{military}} garrison outside Santiago de Cuba, Oriente. Castro's militants intended to dress in army uniforms and arrive at the base on July 25, the festival of St James, when many officers would be away. The rebels would seize control, raid the armory and escape before reinforcements arrived. Supplied with new weaponry, Castro intended to arm supporters and spark a revolution among Oriente's impoverished cane cutters. The plan was to then seize control of a Santiago radio station, broadcasting the Movement's manifesto, hence promoting further uprisings. Castro's plan emulated those of the 19th century Cuban independence fighters who had raided Spanish barracks; Castro <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> the heir to independence leader and national hero José Martí.|$|E
50|$|Although {{he became}} {{best known as}} a publisher, he <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> {{primarily}} <b>as</b> an artist whose business activities existed to support his painting.|$|R
50|$|Where Campbell's {{predecessors}} as Metro Chairman, Fred Gardiner and William Allen, {{had driven}} their agendas at Metro Council, Campbell <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> more <b>as</b> Council's servant with {{the duty to}} implement the policies decided upon by the assembly.|$|R
5000|$|Conway is commemorated {{by having}} a street named after him in Tredegar. He died in February 1933 and he never <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> portrayed <b>as</b> [...] "Owen" [...] in the 1938 film [...] "The Citadel" [...] based on Cronin's novel.|$|R
5|$|Chopin {{arrived in}} Paris in late September 1831; {{he would never}} return to Poland, thus {{becoming}} one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a Pole.|$|E
5|$|Insistent {{that his}} party take an equal {{role in the}} {{coalition}} government, Bruxner formed a good working relationship and long-lasting friendship with Stevens that would ensure the government's stability. The Stevens government had significant success, reducing Lang's 2 million pound deficit by 75%. However, one significant problem was that Stevens had trouble with an unruly backbench, and increasingly depended upon Bruxner and the Country Party. As Deputy Premier, Bruxner <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> loyal to Stevens, but still managed to push through several initiatives that specifically benefited rural areas, including another royal commission {{on the question of}} new States in 1935. The May 1935 election saw Stevens and Bruxner retaining government against a divided and fractious Labor opposition and Bruxner was returned unopposed again in his seat.|$|E
5|$|Model's biographer, the {{military}} historian Steven Newton, {{argues that the}} best explanation for Model's behaviour {{is that he was}} not necessarily a Nazi, but an authoritarian militarist who saw in Hitler the strong leader that Germany needed. According to Newton, Model <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> the professional, apolitical soldier; he possessed a strong sense of German nationalism, with the accompanying tenets of racial prejudice against Slavs and Jews. This characterized many in the German officer corps, but in Model's case it was accompanied by a cynical willingness to placate the Nazi regime to expedite his own goals.|$|E
50|$|Caraher {{grew up in}} Crossmaglen and {{attended}} Queen's University Belfast, where he became active in the Irish nationalist New Ireland Society, although he <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> principally <b>as</b> {{a supporter of the}} British Labour Party. He then became a founder member of the National Democratic Party (NDP).|$|R
5000|$|By now his {{repertoire}} had expanded, including {{not only}} lesser known Ellington pieces, but even [...] "The Champ" [...] from Dizzy Gillespie's band book. The Lyttelton band — he <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> primarily <b>as</b> a leader — {{helped develop the}} careers of many now prominent British musicians, including Tony Coe and Alan Barnes.|$|R
50|$|Pyke {{believed}} his basketball and rugby background {{would help him}} adapt to Australian rules football. With his 200 cm height and 105 kg weight, he <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> playing <b>as</b> a ruckman and/or defender. Pyke was selected by the Swans as a round 4 (57th) pick in the rookie draft and added to the team's list.|$|R
25|$|William Blake {{considered}} Milton {{the major}} English poet. Blake placed Edmund Spenser as Milton's precursor, and <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> Milton's poetical son. In his Milton a Poem, Blake uses Milton as a character.|$|E
25|$|The artist <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> endowed by God {{with the}} ability to sense the true values and {{perspective}} in life. This insight was to be communicated to the ordinary citizen through art.|$|E
25|$|At Health Reid <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a reformer, {{controversially}} increasing capacity {{by introducing}} private companies to run treatment centres for knee, hip and eye operations. He claimed this provided extra staff and extra capacity to help treat more {{patients in the}} NHS at an unprecedented rate.|$|E
50|$|Heinrich Bolleter <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> always <b>as</b> a {{mediator}} between Evangelical tendencies {{of the small}} churches and the ecumenism of the big churches and showed this again and again by his engagement in inter-church relationships. He {{served as president of}} the Evangelical Association of Swiss Evangelical Free Churches and of the ecumenical Working Group of Christian Churches in Switzerland.|$|R
5000|$|Wicksell also {{expressed}} {{his views on}} many social issues and was often {{a critic of the}} status quo. He questioned the institutions of rank, marriage, the church, the monarchy, and the military. [...] While Wicksell fought for a more equal distribution of wealth and income, he <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> primarily <b>as</b> an educator of the public. He desired to influence more than just the field of monetary economics.|$|R
5000|$|The {{courtroom}} testimony <b>saw</b> Sylvester describing <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "fringe" [...] {{individual who}} did not do well with other people. According to testimonies, Sylvester advanced upon Ross shortly after her boyfriend had left.|$|R
25|$|Subsequently Schelling {{identified}} himself with Baruch de Spinoza, to whose thought he <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> approaching. The Darstellung meines Systems, and the expanded {{treatment in the}} lectures on a System der gesamten Philosophie und der Naturphilosophie insbesondere given in Würzburg in 1804, contain elements of Spinoza's philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Thucydides omits {{discussion}} of the arts, literature or the social milieu in which the events in his book take place and in which he himself grew up. He <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> recording an event, not a period, and went to considerable lengths to exclude what he deemed frivolous or extraneous.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time (2 January) Haig {{attended}} church service with George Duncan, who was to have great influence over him. Haig <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> God's servant and was keen to have clergymen sent out whose sermons would remind the men that the war dead were martyrs in a just cause.|$|E
50|$|From 1383 to 1385, the Afghanistan {{area was}} conquered {{from the north}} by Timur, leader of {{neighboring}} Transoxiana (roughly modern-day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and adjacent areas), and {{became a part of}} the Timurid Empire. Timur was from a Turko-Mongol tribe and although a Muslim, <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> more <b>as</b> an heir of Genghis Khan. Timur's armies caused great devastation and are estimated to have caused the deaths of 17 million people.|$|R
25|$|When the touring {{team for}} Sri Lanka and South Africa in late 2011 was picked, O'Keefe was {{overlooked}} {{in favour of}} Beer and Nathan Lyon. Lyon's strong performances <b>saw</b> him establish <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> Australia's first-choice spinner.|$|R
50|$|Griffith {{sought to}} combine {{elements}} of Parnellism {{with the traditional}} separatist approach; he <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> not <b>as</b> a leader but as providing a strategy which a new leader might follow. Central to his strategy was parliamentary abstention: the belief that Irish MPs should refuse to attend the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster, but should instead establish a separate Irish parliament (with an administrative system based on local government) in Dublin.|$|R
25|$|Alfred {{undertook}} no systematic {{reform of}} ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him {{the key to}} the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king he <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.|$|E
25|$|Like his predecessors, Northcote <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a {{diplomatic}} {{representative of the}} British government as well a vice-regal representative. He was actively involved in negotiations between the British and Australian governments over contentious trade and shipping issues, although his role diminished after 1906 when the Liberal Party {{came to power in}} Britain, cutting off much of his influence in London.|$|E
25|$|The PCA {{folded in}} 1996 after its main sponsor, Intel, withdrew its support {{following}} Kasparov's decision {{to play against}} the computer program Deep Blue, which augmented the profile of IBM, one of Intel's main rivals. However, Kasparov still <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> the true world champion (as did {{the majority of the}} chess world), so Kasparov looked for other ways to select his next challenger.|$|E
5000|$|Robinson never <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> only <b>as</b> a comic-book artist. In the 1950s, {{he started}} drawing cover {{illustrations}} for Playbill and tried {{his hand at}} political sketches, producing what he considered his best work: “I did 32 years of political cartoons, one every day for six days a week. That body of work is the one I’m proudest of. While my time on Batman was important and exciting and notable considering the characters {{that came out of}} it, it was really just the start of my life.” ...|$|R
60|$|Burton {{listened to}} his junior's attack unresentingly but with {{increasing}} bewilderment. Then he slipped from his seat and walked hurriedly across to the looking-glass, which he took down from its nail. He gazed at himself long and steadily and from every possible angle. It is probable {{that for the first}} time in his life he <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> then <b>as</b> he really was. He was plain, of insignificant appearance, he was ill and tastelessly dressed. He stood there before the sixpenny-ha'penny mirror and drank the cup of humiliation.|$|R
50|$|Zheng Long {{started his}} {{football}} career after {{he graduated from}} Qingdao Jonoon's youth academy in 2006. Throughout the 2007 season, he established <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a regular for the team; however, {{it was during the}} 2008 season that <b>saw</b> Zheng establish <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a prominent left-sided player and an expert free kick specialistwith five goals in 27 appearances.|$|R
25|$|Cochin <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> an {{educator}} and {{was critical of}} the Rococo style, whose extravagance he publicly criticised in letters in the Mercure de France He argued for technical precision and for skill {{in the use of}} natural elements. In the 1750s he also attacked the early, extreme phase of Neo-classicism known as the Goût grec, exemplified {{in the work of the}} architect Jean-François de Neufforge.|$|E
25|$|Rather than tackle {{literature}} {{the same}} way, Loevy chose instead to adapt major literary works to {{the medium of}} television. In each of these, the works themselves tackled major issues facing Israeli society. In these cases, Loevy <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a conduit by which he could bring the work of leading Israeli authors and playwrights and the issues they tackled to a broader public.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, Modigliani {{returned}} home to Livorno, sickly and tired from his wild lifestyle. Soon {{he was back in}} Paris, this time renting a studio in Montparnasse. He originally <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a sculptor rather than a painter, and was encouraged to continue after Paul Guillaume, an ambitious young art dealer, took an interest in his work and introduced him to sculptor Constantin Brâncuși. He was Constantin Brâncuși's disciple for one year.|$|E
50|$|Sloan {{is remembered}} {{for being a}} rational, shrewd, and very {{successful}} manager, who led GM to become the world's largest corporation, a position it held for many years after his death. His rationality and shrewdness are also remembered by his critics as extending even to cold, plutocratic detachment or avarice. However, the magnitude of Sloan's philanthropy suggests that he <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> differently: <b>as</b> a man with greater talents and greater responsibilities than others, who was thus entitled to great authority but also obligated to, and committed to, beneficence.|$|R
5000|$|... 2013 <b>saw</b> Guyton {{establish}} <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> {{the starting}} halfback for Tasman {{as they went}} on to have a successful season and win the champion division in the ITM Cup, with a 1-point win over Hawke's Bay 26-25. This saw Tasman Makos promoted to the Premership Division of the ITM Cup.|$|R
500|$|Despite Barry's concerns, Cartier {{continued}} to work successfully in television, and at the 1957 Guild of Television Producers and Directors Awards (later known as the British Academy Television Awards, or BAFTAs) he was {{the winner of the}} Drama category. He made a brief return to filmmaking in 1958 when he directed the feature Passionate Summer, but he <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> primarily <b>as</b> a television director, and it remained his favourite medium. [...] "The essence of television is that you can control the viewer's response to a much greater extent than other media permit," [...] he told The Times in 1958.|$|R
