5|$|After Governor Adair's term {{expired in}} 1825, he was succeeded by another Relief Party member, General Joseph Desha. Desha and Sharp had been colleagues in Congress, and Desha re-appointed <b>Sharp</b> <b>as</b> {{attorney}} general. The Relief faction {{in the legislature}} passed several measures favorable to debtors, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck them down as unconstitutional. Unable to muster the votes to remove the hostile justices on the Court of Appeals, Relief partisans in the General Assembly passed legislation to abolish the entire court and create a new one, which Governor Desha promptly stocked with sympathetic judges. For a time, two courts claimed authority as Kentucky's court of last resort; this period {{was referred to as}} the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E

His actions inadvertently release Lazarus into the West. In a seeming bit of mercy, Lazarus bites Jericho and gives him {{the curse of the}} vampire, causing him to slowly turn into one. The game continues with the introduction of Darkwatch agent Cassidy <b>Sharp</b> <b>as</b> well as the appearance of Shadow, Jericho's undead horse whom he fed on and turned in a frenzy after being bitten by Lazarus.|$|E
5|$|Brimsek {{decided to}} help the war effort next season by joining the United States Coast Guard. During his time with the Coast Guard, he played with the Coast Guard Cutters hockey team in Curtis Bay, Maryland, and later served in the South Pacific. After the war ended, Brimsek {{returned}} to the Bruins {{in time for the}} 1945–46 season. However, Brimsek was not as <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> he was before due to having not played any professional hockey for two years. In his first season back, Brimsek guided the Bruins to the Finals, matching up with the Montreal Canadiens. The Bruins were defeated in five games with three games requiring overtime. Brimsek was applauded for his performance in the playoffs, compensating for his team's weak defence. This marked Brimsek's fourth appearance in the Finals and it would be his last. At the end of the season, Brimsek was also named to the NHL Second All-Star Team, the fifth time in his career.|$|E
5|$|Brimsek {{spent his}} first nine NHL seasons with the Bruins and during this time, he {{received}} numerous individual awards. He won the Calder Memorial Trophy, the Vezina Trophy twice, and he {{was named to the}} NHL All-Star Team eight times (twice on the First Team and six times on the Second Team). He was also a member of two Stanley Cup championships (1939 and 1941). During World War II, Brimsek left the NHL for two years in order to serve with the United States Coast Guard skating with the vaunted Coast Guard Cutters which featured fellow Eveleth native John Mariucci. After being discharged from the Coast Guard, Brimsek returned to the NHL for the 1945–46 season where it was noted that his skills were not as <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> before he left. Despite this, he still managed {{to be one of the}} best goalies in the league. Brimsek was traded to the Black Hawks following the 1948–49 season due to personal reasons. He spent one season with the Black Hawks before retiring from professional hockey.|$|E

25|$|The Stock Market {{crash in}} New York led people to hoard their money; as {{consumption}} fell, the American economy steadily contracted, 1929-32. Given the close economic {{links between the}} two countries, the collapse quickly affected Canada. Added to the woes of the prairies were those of Ontario and Quebec, whose manufacturing industries were now victims of overproduction. Massive lay-offs occurred and other companies collapsed into bankruptcy. This collapse was not as <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> that in the United States, but was the second sharpest collapse in the world.|$|E
30|$|The peaks appear nearly {{identical}} {{in shape for}} all samples except that they differ in the intensity only. The intensity of the peaks increases and become <b>sharper</b> <b>as</b> the dopant concentration increase. For undoped, UV emission peaks are slightly broader whereas the peaks are narrower and sharper and of higher intensity for all doped samples and become <b>sharper</b> <b>as</b> the dopant concentrations increase. From here, {{we know that the}} optical properties of nanostructures also differ with the aspect ratio of the nanostructure in which we observe only UV emission for low aspect ratio and vice versa. The increase in peak intensity with the corresponding increase in dopant concentration can be attributed to near band-edge emission from crystalline ZnO and recombination of free excitons. This is in good agreement with the findings reported in [11].|$|R

25|$|The {{election}} of Gerald <b>Sharp</b> <b>as</b> Archbishop of the Diocese of Brisbane in 1921 heralded an important expansion phase for the Anglican Church in Queensland. Over {{the next ten}} years 57 new churches were built in the Brisbane Diocese and over 30,000 new members were received into communion. Timber (considered temporary) churches were mainly built in new parishes, while many brick (permanent) churches replaced earlier structures at older parishes. Large-scale building projects also occurred at church schools, including the Anglican Church Grammar School (Churchie) at East Brisbane, during this period.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the process}} of {{developing}} his art, Al-Zahawi tried various methods of sculpting, yet he vastly preferred the coiling method. The coiling method allows the artists to create irregular forms with superimposed volume and with angles as <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> 45°, collectively allowing for the construction of very large forms that can reach up to 7 feet high with a diameter as wide as 4 feet. As each inch is built, coil by coil, similar to how one builds a house, the final product becomes a one of a kind form that is rarely repeated, and oftentimes goes far beyond traditional ceramics.|$|E

Charles Palmer (who also directed Hallowe'en Party for the series) directs this instalment, with the screenplay being written by Stewart Harcourt (who also wrote the screenplay for Murder on the Orient Express).

25|$|Encouraged by {{publication}} of Clarkson's essay, an informal committee {{was set up}} between small groups from the petitioning Quakers, Clarkson and others, {{with the goal of}} lobbying Members of Parliament (MPs). In May 1787, they formed the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. The Committee included Granville <b>Sharp</b> <b>as</b> Chairman and Josiah Wedgwood, as well as Clarkson. Clarkson also approached the young William Wilberforce, who as an Anglican and an MP was connected within the British Parliament. Wilberforce was one of few parliamentarians to have had sympathy with the Quaker petition; he had already put a question about the slave trade before the House of Commons, and became {{known as one of the}} earliest Anglican abolitionists.|$|E
25|$|For nearby {{objects in}} the universe, {{spectral}} absorption lines are very <b>sharp,</b> <b>as</b> only photons with energies just sufficient to cause an atomic transition can cause that transition. However, the distances between quasars and the telescopes which detect them are large, {{which means that the}} expansion of the universe causes light to undergo noticeable redshifting. This means that as light from the quasar travels through the IGM and is redshifted, wavelengths which had been above the Lyman Alpha limit are stretched, and will in effect begin to fill in the Lymann absorption band. This means that instead of showing sharp spectral absorption lines, a quasar's light which has traveled through a large, spread out region of neutral hydrogen will show a Gunn-Peterson trough.|$|E
