40|$|Abstract—The {{detection}} {{of a target}} echo in a <b>sonar</b> <b>image</b> is usually a difficult task since the reverberation, consisting {{of a large number}} of spurious echoes, generates a lot of false alarms. In this paper, we propose two new detectors derived from <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> algorithms. These detectors are respectively based on a morphological and a statistical contrast. Each detector only requires setting a few parameters. This setting is done using some prior knowledge about the data (shape of the emitted signal and the used antenna, characteristics of the reverberation). Nevertheless, an extensive statistical study of the detection performances proves that the proposed methods are robust and that even an imprecise setting of the parameters leads to satisfactory results. Applied to the real data, these detectors and their sequential combination lead to a significant improvement on the performances: The false alarm rate is drastically reduced while the detection probability is preserved. Based on different contrasts, these detectors have complementary behaviors. Therefore, a further improvement is achieved by a fusion of the different results to classify the remaining echoes as whether spurious or true detection.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the detection of}} underwater mines echoes with application to synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imaging. A detection method based on local first- and second-order statistical properties of the sonar images is proposed. It consists of mapping the data onto the mean–standard deviation plane high-lighting these properties. With this representation, an adaptive thresholding of the data enables {{the separation of the}} echoes from the reverberation background. The procedure is automated using an entropy criterion (setting of a threshold). Applied on various SAS data sets containing both proud and buried mines, the pro-posed method positively compares to the conventional amplitude threshold detection method. The performances are evaluated by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

40|$|Abstract: Several {{researches}} estimate {{locations and}} attitudes of underwater vehicles through seafloor patterns in onboard video or <b>sonar</b> <b>images.</b> However, seafloor maps should be prepared in advance and the images are usually noisy and obscure. In practical images only the sea surface and the seafloor are able to be identified. A new attitude estimation technique based on acoustical <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> has been developed using imaging sonars with Hough transformation for noisy <b>sonar</b> <b>images</b> in our research. The method estimates onboard sonar attitude parameters from {{the location of the}} reference plane like the sea surface in the <b>sonar</b> <b>image.</b> In this paper an additional approach of rotation parameter estimation is introduced using these attitude parameter time variations. It does not require the Hough transformation, hence it is useful for smaller and lighter ocean observing platforms.

40|$|A <b>sonar</b> {{system and}} <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> method have been {{developed}} to continuously estimate the seafloor subsurface burial depth of a gamma-ray spectrometer that is towed along the seafloor by a ship. The towed gamma-ray spectrometer, called the RESQ hose, is an instrument designed to measure radiation levels in seafloor sediments that were contaminated {{as a result of the}} accident at the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant. In situ measurements of subsurface burial depth can increase the accuracy of the radionuclide concentration levels estimated by the RESQ hose by allowing for more accurate modeling of the measurement conditions. The reliability of the system is verified through sea trials performed near the outlet of the Abukuma River. Continuous measurements of burial depth are achieved with an outlier ratio of less than 5 %. The burial depths measured by the device show a strong correlation with the acoustic backscatter intensity of side-scan <b>sonar</b> <b>images</b> obtained along the surveyed transect, indicating that burial depth is dependent on sediment type. We examine the influence of burial depth on the conversion factors between detected gamma-ray count rates and the concentrations of 134 Cs and 137 Cs. For both nuclides, the calculated factors increase by nearly 80 % as burial depth increases from 0 to 11 cm. The converted results from the measured 137 Cs count rates are compared with a core sample obtained near the transect, with the nearest point within a factor of two of the sampling result...|$|R

40|$|As {{the largest}} {{unexplored}} area on earth, the underwater world has unlimited at traction to marine scientists. Due {{to the complexity}} of the underwater environment and the limitations of human divers, underwater exploration has been facilitated by the use of submarines, Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). In recent years, use of autonomous control systems being integrated with visual sensors has increased substantially, especially in marine applications involving guidance of AUVs. In this work, autonomous fish-tracking via AUV with vision servoing control system is studied with the purpose of assisting marine biologists in gathering detailed information about the behaviors, habits, mobility, and local and global distributions of particular fish species. The main goal of this work in this thesis is to develop an AUV sensing system, including both video and auxiliary sonar, which has the ability to carry out visually guided autonomous tracking of a particular species of fish, Large Mouth Bass. A key in enabling fish-tracking involves the development of a vision-processing algorithm to measure the position of the vehicle relative to the fish. It is challenging because of the complex nature of the underwater environment including dynamic and varied lighting conditions, turbulent water, suspended organic particles and various underwater plants and animals, and the deformable body of fish while swimming. These issues cause target fish identification by computer vision processing extremely difficult. In automated fish-tracking work, we provide two valid and efficient segmentation and recognition vision algorithms to identify a fish from the natural underwater environment: one is a feature extraction algorithm based on Gabor filter texture segmentation and a new approach that we call projection curve recognition. It is able to extract the feature on the fish tail and body and successfully describe the fish as two straight line segments. The second algorithm is SIFT based fish recognition algorithm. The SIFT approach introduced by David Lowe in 1999 extracts distinctive invariant features to scaling, illumination, rotation or translation of the image. The reliable keypoints matching in the database of keypoints from target fish is implemented by Best-Bin-First (BBF) algorithm. Clustering keypoints that agree on the possible object with Hough transform are identified as the object fish, reliable recognition is possible with as few as 3 features. Finally, a dynamic recognition process was designed using continuously updated fish model to match and recognize the target fish from a series of video frames. The SIFT Based recognition algorithm is effective and efficient in identifying Large Mouth Bass in a natural cluttering underwater environment. For a monocular camera system, the depth of field is extremely hard to obtain by vision processing. Hence, the system is augmented with a forward-looking digital image micro sonar. With the <b>sonar</b> <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> algorithm, the target fish is recognized. Sonar can not only provide the relative range between the fish and AUV, but also assist in identifying the target. Finally, the relative position and orientation of the fish in the image plane is estimated using an image processing method, transforming the coordinates between camera, sonar and AUV, and applying the estimation algorithm. The results of o off-line data processing taken from a natural Lake environment shows these computer vision algorithms for identifying fish and state estimation are efficient and successful. The proposed system has potential to enable a vision servo control system of AUV to reliably track a target fish in natural underwater environment...|$|E

The underwater environment being heterogeneous, the <b>sonar</b> <b>images</b> have a very complex background, low contrast, and deteriorative edges. To locate and identify the underwater objects from the <b>Sonar</b> <b>images,</b> the initial step needs to be undertaken is the segmentation. Several general purpose algorithms have been developed for segmentation of various images.

40|$|In {{active sonar}} processing, the {{discrimination}} {{of the target}} versus clutter can be a significant challenge. Whereas conventional processing often uses target kinematics to limit the possible target tracks, it has recently been shown that frequency domain information (based on the waveguide invariant principle) can also be incorporated to further limit the possible target tracks in an environmentally robust fashion. This paper presents physics-based signal processing methods to extract information about the target track from striations in a target spectrogram formed from the echo spectra at each active sonar pulse repetition interval. The target tracking information is formulated as a post-track likeliness statistic that is extracted from the <b>sonar</b> data with <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> techniques.

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} new <b>image</b> <b>sonar</b> {{segmentation}} by combining two complementary competencies. On the one hand, following an <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> approach, {{we aim at}} partitioning raw image data to provide a binary image. On the other hand, we take advantage of technological knowledge such as the principle of <b>sonar</b> <b>image</b> formation. For <b>sonar</b> <b>images,</b> grey-level histogram generally presents a single mode which entails a poor separation of two theoretical modes related to reverberation and shadow subpopulations of the image. The separation of these two modes is of critical interest in a further description of objects from their cast shadows. In this paper, an optimal filter is specified by a criterion which aims at changing the statistical properties of each area while making threshold value selection from the histogram easier. While minimizing the output pixels variance, pixel values in each region concentrate around the respective average value while, simultaneously, two distinct modes appear on the histogram of the filtered image. The minimum value found between the two modes in the smoothed histogram leads to the searched threshold. In addition, we show how filter aspect depends as well on the <b>image</b> <b>sonar</b> resolution as on sonar parameters...|$|R

This paper first introduces the hardware platform of the underwater monitoring system and a 3 D model of the underwater rotational mechanism. Next, related image pre-processing is conducted to improve its accuracy. A SURF algorithm is then applied to extract the speeded-up robust feature (SURF) points.

Because the contour convergence of the active contour model depends on the selection of initial position, the active contour model is applied in <b>sonar</b> <b>image</b> segmentation. This paper proposed a selection method based on local standard deviation of image as the outline of initial contour. Due to the disturbance of noise, <b>sonar</b> <b>image</b> is usually affected in resolution and contrast. Firstly, <b>sonar</b> <b>image</b> is enhanced by top-hat and bottom-hat transformation in image morphology. Then after image enhancement, a suitable threshold value is chose for rough binarization and the standard deviation of target areas to calculate the local image.

In this context, the need to transmit side scan <b>sonar</b> <b>images</b> over an acoustic low-bandwidth channel calls for the use of compression techniques. This paper proposes a wavelet-based method for compressing side scan <b>sonar</b> <b>images.</b> Wavelets are an adequate choice because their intrinsic properties suit side scan <b>sonar</b> <b>images.</b> In fact, achieved results confirm that wavelets yield high compression rates. Furthermore, wavelet-based compression enhances side scan <b>sonar</b> <b>images</b> by reducing noise without smoothing important details...|$|R
40|$|The use of high–resolution, {{active sonar}} systems in {{littoral}} environments {{often results in}} high false alarm rates. False alarm rate inflation (FARI) and non–Rayleigh reverberation (NRR) are two well–documented causes. FARI may occur when the reverberation in the normaliser window is non–stationary, while NRR may occur when the sonar footprint is {{too small for the}} central limit theorem to apply for the scatterer statistics. The main originator for false alarms in littoral environments are either the sea floor itself or objects located on the sea floor. Automatic classification methods may be used to reduce the false alarm rate. Conventionally, advanced <b>sonar</b> <b>processing</b> or <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> techniques have been used directly on received data. Increased availability of environmental information allows for more sophisticated algorithms that employ acoustic modelling to extract more information from recorded data. This thesis addresses two topics of interest. The first topic is on how acoustic modelling combined with environmental knowledge may be used to increase the ability of anti–submarine warfare sonars to classify a detected target. The second topic is on how environmental uncertainty may be reduced in order to improve the fidelity of the proposed classification algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Digital <b>Image</b> <b>Processing</b> is {{a rapidly}} {{evolving}} field with growing applications in Science and Engineering. Modern digital technologyhas {{made it possible}} to manipulate multi-dimensional signals. Digital <b>Image</b> <b>Processing</b> has a broad spectrum of applications. They includeremote sensing data via satellite, medical <b>image</b> <b>processing,</b> radar, <b>sonar</b> and acoustic <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> and robotics. Uncompressed multimedia graphics, audio and video data require considerable storage capacity and transmission bandwidth. Despite rapid progress in mass-storage density, processor speeds, and digital communication system performance, demand for data storage capacity and data- transmission bandwidth continues to outstrip the capabilities of available technologies. This is a crippling disadvantage during transmission and storage. So there arises a need for data compression of images. There are several Image compression techniques. Two ways of classifying compression techniques are mentioned here. 1) Loss less Vs Loss compression 2) Predictive Vs Transform coding For correct diagnosis, the medical images should be displayed with 100 % quality. The popular JPEG image compression technique is loss technique so causes some loss in quality of image. Even though the loss is not a cause of concern for non-medical images, it makes the analysis of medical images a difficult task. So it is not suitable for the compression of medical images. In the proposed work a Region Based Compression Approach using Block-Based Binary Plane Technique for medical images is developed. This is {{based on the fact that}} in the case of medical images, such as X-rays, only some part of the image is useful. In this technique the X-ray image is displayed to the Physician. The Physician identifies the region (rectangular in shape) where the important information for the diagnosis is present. Then the part identified by the Physician is compressed using loss less technique so that it is extracted with no loss in quality when it is displayed. The remaining part of the image is compressed with some loss. For the compression of region identified we use the Loss less Block Based Binary Plane Technique and for the other part Loss Block Based Binary Plane Technique is used...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} methods for {{segmenting}} noisy two-dimensional forward-scan <b>sonar</b> <b>images</b> and classify and model their background. The segmentation approach differentiates the highlight blobs, cast shadows, and {{the background of}} <b>sonar</b> <b>images.</b> There is usually little information within relatively large background regions corresponding to the flat sea bottom and (or) water column, as they are often corrupted with speckle noise. Our experiments show that the background texture {{is dominated by the}} speckle noise which has the appearance of a pseudo-random texture. We show that the background texture of the underwater <b>sonar</b> <b>images</b> can be categorized by a small number of classes. The statistical features work better than the texture-based features in categorizing the pseudo-random background, which further strengthen our hypothesis of the dominance of noise over the background texture. As a result, we can model the noisy background with a few parameters. This has an application in coding the <b>sonar</b> <b>images</b> in which highlight blob regions and cast shadows are coded at the encoder side while the speckle noise-corrupted background can be synthesized at the decoder side. Since the background regions occupy a large fraction of the FS <b>sonar</b> <b>image,</b> we expect higher compression rates than most current image or video coding standards and other custom-designed <b>sonar</b> <b>image</b> compression techniques...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} of multiplicative speckle noise in side scan <b>sonar</b> <b>images</b> unfavourably affects the detection and classification of ob- jects in the image. This noise {{is related to}} the sensing system and the image formation process. Speckle removal is a pre-processing step required in such images for applications like segmentation and registration. Most of the speckle reduction techniques intro- duces a bias after the homomorphic approach is applied on the observation model of the side scan <b>sonar</b> <b>image</b> to convert the multiplicative model into an additive one. In this paper an unscented Kalman filter based approach for single look side scan <b>sonar</b> <b>image</b> estimation from the observation model of the image is proposed. First the noise level in the single look side scan <b>sonar</b> <b>image</b> is estimated using a patch based algorithm and then non blind denoising is done.

40|$|Inferring {{information}} from a set of acquired data is the main objective of any signal processing (SP) method. In particular, the common problem of estimating {{the value of a}} vector of parameters from a set of noisy measurements {{is at the core of}} a plethora of scientific and technological advances in the last decades; for example, wireless communications, radar and <b>sonar,</b> biomedicine, <b>image</b> <b>processing,</b> and seismology, just to name a few. Developing an estimation algorithm often begins by assuming a statistical model for the measured data, i. e. a probability density function (pdf) which if correct, fully characterizes the behaviour of the collected data/measurements. Experience with real data, however, often exposes the limitations of any assumed data model since modelling errors at some level are always present. Consequently, the true data model and the model assumed to derive the estimation algorithm could differ. When this happens, the model is said to be mismatched or misspecified. Therefore, understanding the possible performance loss or regret that an estimation algorithm could experience under model misspecification is of crucial importance for any SP practitioner. Further, understanding the limits on the performance of any estimator subject to model misspecification is of practical interest. Motivated by the widespread and practical need to assess the performance of a mismatched estimator, the goal of this paper is to help to bring attention to the main theoretical findings on estimation theory, and in particular on lower bounds under model misspecification, that have been published in the statistical and econometrical literature in the last fifty years. Secondly, some applications are discussed to illustrate the broad range of areas and problems to which this framework extends, and consequently the numerous opportunities available for SP researchers.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the analysis of side-looking <b>sonar</b> <b>images,</b> and specif- ically with the identification of the types of seabed that are present in such images, and with the detection of man-made objects in such <b>images.</b> Side-looking <b>sonar</b> <b>images</b> are, broadly speaking, the result of the physical interaction between acous- tic waves and the bottom of the sea. Because of this interaction, the types of seabed appear as textured areas in side-looking <b>sonar</b> <b>images.</b> The texture descrip- tors commonly used in the field of sonar imagery fail at accurately identifying the types of seabed because the types of seabed, hence the textures, are extremely variable. In this thesis, we did not use the traditional texture descriptors to identify the types of seabed. We rather used scattering operators which recently appeared in the field of signal and <b>image</b> <b>processing.</b> We assessed how well the types of seabed are identified through two inference algorithms, one based on affine spaces, and the other based on the concept of similarity by composition. This thesis is also concerned with the detection of man-made objects in side-looking sonar im- ages. An object detector may be described as a method which, when applied to a certain number of <b>sonar</b> <b>images,</b> produces a set of detections. Some of these are true positives, and correspond to real objects. Others are false positives, and do not correspond to real objects. The present object detectors suffer from a high false positive rate in complex environments, that is to say, complex types of seabed. The hypothesis we will follow is {{that it is possible to}} reduce the number of false positives through a characterisation of the similarity between the detections and the seabed, the false positives being by nature part of the seabed. We will use scattering operators to represent the detections and the same two inference algorithms to quantify how similar the detections are to the seabed...|$|R
