40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve {{discharge}} characteristics of engine ignition, a dual-coil ignition was designed. Simulation models of ignition energy, secondary voltage and <b>spark</b> <b>duration</b> of this ignition were established. The influence of discharge time interval and energy distribution method on discharge characteristics of the dual-coil ignition was studied. Compared with single-coil ignition, {{the results show that}} dual-coil ignition produced higher secondary voltage, ignition energy and extended <b>spark</b> <b>duration.</b> When total ignition energy remains constant, the dual-coil coupled discharge mode can improve energy conversion efficiency. The ignition can achieve flexible switching of discharge modes and optimal control of discharge characteristics，which is beneficial for improving fuel economy and reducing exhaust emissions...|$|E
40|$|Running an {{internal}} combustion engine with diluted methane/air mixtures has a potential of reducing emissions and increasing efficiency. However, diluted mixtures need high ignition energy in a sufficiently large volume, which is difficult to accomplish. Increasing the <b>spark</b> <b>duration</b> has {{shown to be a}} promising way of delivering more energy into the diluted charge, but this requires a more sophisticated ignition system. This work focuses on evaluating the effects regarding enhancing early flame development, reducing cyclic variations and extending the lean limit using a new capacitive ignition system as compared to a conventional inductive ignition system. The new system offers the opportunity to customise the spark by altering the electric pulse train characteristics choosing the number of pulses, the length of the individual pulses as well as the time delay between them. Several different spark configurations were evaluated for the new capacitive system, including varying <b>spark</b> <b>duration</b> between approximately 0. 5 - 1. 2 ms and maximum current levels of 0. 2 - 0. 4 A. Results show that longer <b>spark</b> <b>duration</b> and faster initial energy deposition has a positive effect on the lean limit and the combustion stability, while the current level shows little or no effect on these variables. The more advanced capacitive system is capable of delivering more energy and longer <b>spark</b> <b>duration,</b> resulting in reduced cyclic variations and enhanced early flame development. With the longer spark durations of the capacitive system the lean limit was extended from λ = 1. 65 to approximately λ = 1. 75...|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} combustion {{depends on}} many factors, such as injection, turbulence and ignition characteristics. With {{the improvement of}} internal combustion engines the turbulence intensity and internal pressure have risen, demanding more efficient and powerful ignition systems. In direct injection engines, the stratified charge resultant from the wall/air-guided or spray-guided system requires even more energy. The Paschen’s law shows that spark plug gap and mixture density are proportional to the dielectric rupture voltage. It is known that larger spark gaps promote higher efficiency in the internal combustion engines, since the mixture reaction rate rises proportionally. However, the ignition system must be adequate to the imposed gap, not only on energy, but also on voltage and <b>spark</b> <b>duration.</b> For the reported study in this work two test benches were built: a standard inductive ignition system and a capacitive discharge high energy ignition system, with variable voltage and capacitance.

40|$|The catastrophic {{outcome of}} {{accidental}} explosions to humans and property has caused an increased {{need for new}} knowledge {{in order to prevent}} and mitigate the effects of such events. Amongst other substances, a wide range of gases and dusts can cause such explosions. The present experimental study is concerned with electrostatic- spark-initiation of dust explosions. Lycopodium clavatum was chosen as the test dust, partly because this dust has been widely used in previously published investigations on various aspects of dust explosions. Also, the dust can be obtained throughout the world and research results from various researchers can be compared. In the present study transient experimental clouds of lycopodium clavatum in air were produced by dispersing a given amount of the dust, placed in a small cavity {{at the bottom of the}} explosion vessel, by a blast of air. In almost all experiments the nominal dust concentration was stoichiometric. In a few experiments it was twice the stoichiometric. Synchronization of the transient experimental dust cloud and the spark discharge was brought about by the dust cloud itself, when it entered the spark gap that had already been charged to a voltage somewhat below the natural breakdown voltage in just air. This breakdown mechanism may well be one of the mechanisms of dust cloud/spark synchronization that can actually operate in accidental industrial dust explosions initiated by electrostatic spark discharges. One specific problem studied in the present investigation was the influence of the <b>spark</b> discharge <b>duration</b> on the ease by which the dust cloud could be ignited when using the inherent spark discharge triggering method. It was known from the literature that the lowest electric spark energy that can ignite a dust cloud depends strongly on the discharge time of the spark discharge. In the present experiment the discharge duration was varied by varying the series inductance in the discharge circuit. The experimental probabilities of ignition, based on 40 - 100 apparently identical successive experiments, were presented as functions of the <b>spark</b> discharge <b>duration,</b> electrode shape, <b>spark</b> energy and spark resistance. The influence of air humidity on the natural breakdown voltages of the two different spark gap geometries used was also investigated. The experiments confirmed that the minimum stored capacitor energies required for igniting the dust clouds decreased markedly with increasing <b>spark</b> discharge <b>duration.</b> There was only a modest influence of the spark electrode geometry on the minimum ignition energy (MIE). Experimental correlations between various other parameters were also obtained. The results obtained have thrown light on the influences of some relevant physical parameters on the likelihood of accidental electrostatic spark ignition of dust clouds. However, there is a clear need for more research in this area, and some suggestions for future studies are indicated...|$|R
50|$|In pyrotechnics, {{iron filings}} and metal alloys such as {{magnalium}} {{may be used}} to create sparks.

We tested whether decreasing the rate of SR Ca depletion by partially inhibiting SR Ca release channels (ryanodine receptors) delays Ca spark termination. In permeabilized cat ventricular myocytes, 0. 7 mM tetracaine caused almost complete Ca spark inhibition followed by a recovery significantly below control level. The recovery was associated with increased SR Ca load and increased Ca <b>spark</b> <b>duration.</b> Additionally, SR Ca release events lasting several hundred milliseconds occurred consistently. These events had a significantly lower initial Ca release flux followed by a stable plateau, indicating delayed release termination and maintained SR Ca load. Increasing SR Ca load (without inhibiting SR Ca release rate) or decreasing SR Ca release rate (without increasing SR Ca load) both induced only a small increase in <b>spark</b> <b>duration.</b> These results show that the combination of decreased release flux and increased SR Ca load has synergistic effects and exerts major changes on the termination of Ca release events. Long-lasting Ca release events may originate from highly interconnected release junctions where Ca diffusion from neighboring sites partially compensates Ca depletion, thereby delaying SR Ca-dependent termination. Eventually, these events terminate by luminal Ca-independent mechanisms, such as inactivation, adaptation, or stochastic attrition...|$|E

We show that nor-mal sparks occur when the CRU network is monostable and excitable, while long-lasting sparks occur when the network dynamics possesses multiple metastable attractors, each attractor corresponding to a different spatial firing pattern of sparks. We further highlight the mechanisms and conditions that produce long-lasting sparks, demonstrating the existence of an optimal range of RyR open probability favoring long-lasting sparks.

Results: In voltage-clamped, Fura- 2 -loaded cardiomyocytes, L-type Ca 2 + current (ICa,L) and Ca 2 + transient amplitude were both increased in the Ad-CSQ group by ∼ 78 %. Doubling the external Ca 2 + concentration in the control group (Ad-LacZ) increased the LTCC amplitude to a similar degree (85 ± 6 %), but increased the Ca 2 + transient amplitude by 149 ± 13 %.

Alternatively, nifedipine (0. 5 μM) was used to reduce ICa,L in Ad-CSQ-transfected cells to values comparable to control (Ad-LacZ). Under these conditions, Ca 2 + transient amplitude was not different from Ad-LacZ, but the SR Ca 2 + content was ∼ 60 % higher as assessed by both the caffeine-induced Ca 2 + release and the accompanying Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger current (INCX).

The breakdown voltage requirements of the spark in the two phase flow differed from they of premixed gaseous mixtures. In the range of weak mixtures investigated, optimum <b>spark</b> <b>duration</b> was found to vary depending on spray drop size between 30 and 60 microseconds. Minimum ignition energy increased with increase in velocity, but decreased with reduction in drop diameter and with increase in equivalence ratio. Low flow number atomisers giving small drop sizes extended the weak ignition limits for a given spark energy. Spray drop size and distribution were found to have a singularly large influence on all aspects of ignition. The thesis includes a detailed account of the designs and procedures employed in carrying out the investigation, and also a discussion on the significance of the results on the practical aspects of liquid fuel ignition in aero engine combustion system...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} sorcin on cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, adult rabbit ventricular myocytes were transfected with a recombinant adenovirus coding for human sorcin (Ad-sorcin). A beta-galactosidase adenovirus (Ad-LacZ) {{was used as a}} control. Fractional shortening in response to 1 -Hz field stimulation (at 37 degreesC) was significantly reduced in Ad-sorcin-transfected myocytes compared with control myocytes (2. 10 +/- 0. 05 % [n = 311] versus 2. 42 +/- 0. 06 % [n = 312], respectively; P < 0. 001). Action potential duration (at 20 &DEG;C) was significantly less in the Ad-sorcin group (458 +/- 22 ms, n = 11) compared with the control group (520 +/- 19 ms, n = 10; P < 0. 05). In voltage-clamped, fura 2 -loaded myocytes (20 degreesC), a reduced peak-systolic and end-diastolic [Ca 2 +](i) was observed after Ad-sorcin transfection. L-type Ca 2 + current amplitude and time course were unaffected. Caffeine-induced Ca 2 + release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the accompanying inward Na+-Ca 2 + exchanger (NCX) current revealed a significantly lower SR Ca 2 + content and faster Ca 2 +-extrusion kinetics in Ad-sorcin-transfected cells. Higher NCX activity after Ad-sorcin transfection was confirmed by measuring the NCX current-voltage relationship. beta-Escin-permeabilized rabbit cardiomyocytes were used to study the effects of sorcin overexpression on Ca 2 + sparks imaged with fluo 3 at 145 to 160 nmol/L [Ca 2 +] using a confocal microscope. Under these conditions, caffeine-mediated SR Ca 2 + release was not different between the two groups. Spontaneous <b>spark</b> frequency, <b>duration,</b> width, and amplitude were lower in sorcin-overexpressing myocytes. In summary, sorcin overexpression in rabbit cardiomyocytes decreased Ca 2 +-transient amplitude predominately by lowering SR Ca 2 + content via increased NCX activity. The effect of sorcin overexpression on Ca 2 + sparks indicates an effect on the ryanodine receptor that may also influence excitation-contraction coupling...|$|R
40|$|In cardiac muscle, Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release (CICR) {{from the}} sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} (SR) defines the amplitude and time {{course of the}} Ca 2 + transient. The global elevation of the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration arises from the spatial and temporal summation of elementary Ca 2 + release events, Ca 2 + sparks. Ca 2 + sparks represent the concerted opening {{of a group of}} ryanodine receptors (RYRs), which are under the control of several modulatory proteins and diffusible cytoplasmic factors (e. g., Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and ATP). Here, we examined by which mechanism the free intracellular Mg 2 + ([Mg 2 +] free) affects various Ca 2 + spark parameters in permeabilized mouse ventricular myocytes, such as <b>spark</b> frequency, <b>duration,</b> rise time, and full width, at half magnitude and half maximal duration. Varying the levels of free ATP and Mg 2 + in specifically designed solutions allowed us to separate the inhibition of RYRs by Mg 2 + from the possible activation by ATP and Mg 2 +-ATP via the adenine binding site of the channel. Changes in [Mg 2 +] free generally led to biphasic alterations of the Ca 2 + spark frequency. For example, lowering [Mg 2 +] free resulted in an abrupt increase of spark frequency, which slowly recovered toward the initial level, presumably as a result of SR Ca 2 + depletion. Fitting the Ca 2 + spark inhibition by [Mg 2 +] free with a Hill equation revealed a K i of 0. 1 mM. In conclusion, our results support the notion that local Ca 2 + release and Ca 2 + sparks are modulated by Mg 2 + in the intracellular environment. This seems to occur predominantly by hindering Ca 2 +-dependent activation of the RYRs through competitive Mg 2 + occupancy of the high-affinity activation site of the channels. These findings help to characterize CICR in cardiac muscle under normal and pathological conditions, where the levels of Mg 2 + and ATP can change...|$|R
40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} cycle simulation of the four-stroke spark-ignition engine {{was used to}} determine the effects of variations in engine design and operating parameters on engine performance and emission characteristics. The overall objective was to use the engine cycle simulation to determine the difference between a propane-fuelled and an iso-octane-fuelled engine for the same operating conditions and engine specifications. A comprehensive parametric investigation was conducted to examine the effects of variations in load, speed, combustion <b>duration,</b> <b>spark</b> timing, equivalence ratio, exhaust gas recycle, and compression ratio for a 3. 3 liter, Chrysler Minivan, V 6 engine operating on propane. Parameters were selected for the analysis. Variations in the brake specific fuel consumption, brake specific NOx emissions, and mean exhaust temperature were determined for both the propane-fuelled and the iso-octane-fuelled engines. Brake specific fuel consumption and mean exhaust temperature values for the propane-fuelled engine were consistently lower (3 to 5 %) than the corresponding values for the iso-octane-fuelled engine. Fuel structure did not have a significant effect on brake specific nitric oxide emissions. Predictions made from the simulation were compared with some of the available experimental results. Predicted brake torque and brake power showed acceptable quantitative agreement (less than 10 % variation) in the low engine speed range (1, 000 to 3, 000 rpm) and similar trends with the available experimental data...|$|R
