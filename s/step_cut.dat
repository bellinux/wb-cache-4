The Asscher family secured an international design patent so the Royal Asscher cut could not be legally imitated; Royal Asscher is also trademarked and the company owns exclusive rights to the name. To further guarantee authenticity each diamond is laser inscribed with the Royal Asscher logo and an identification number belonging to a single diamond only. The number is logged with the Royal Asscher Diamond Company in Amsterdam and a Royal Asscher certificate accompanies the diamond.|$|E

Wu agreed, but believing that he, as the commanding general, should withdraw last, did so, sending Xiao with the cavalry first. The cavalry was therefore able to escape, {{but most of the}} foot soldiers—30,000—and Wu himself were captured by Wang and taken to the Northern Zhou capital Chang'an. Xiao was able to return to Jiankang and continued to serve as a general under Emperor Xuan. In 580, after Northern Zhou captured the region between the Yangtze and Huai from Chen, Emperor Xuan made an attempt to recapture the territory, and Xiao served in the campaign along with Emperor Xuan's nephew Chen Huiji (陳慧紀), but after he was unable to capture Guangling (廣陵, in modern Huaiyin, Jiangsu), he withdrew. Another campaign waged by Xiao and Zhou Luohou (周羅睺) in 581 also ended in failure.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A Comparison of Single Leg Squat and Side <b>Step</b> <b>Cut</b> Kinematics in Healthy and ACL Reconstructed Populations Jarrett JE Sorge, University of Connecticut STUDY DESIGN: Case Control Study OBJECTIVE: To compare single leg squat (SLS) {{kinematics}} to side <b>step</b> <b>cut</b> (SSC) kinematics {{and vertical}} ground reaction force in {{individuals with a}} history of ACL reconstruction and healthy controls. BACKGROUND: There are currently no objective criteria to progress athletes into cutting activities during rehabilitation. The single leg squat possesses similar three-planar neuromuscular control as a cutting task. Assessing movement dysfunction during the single leg squat could limit injury risk during cutting activities. METHODS: 44 individuals active in cutting, jumping, or landing activities participated in this study. 22 athletes had a history of ACL reconstruction (14 male, 8 female) Age, years; Height,; Mass, kg). 22 healthy athletes (14 male, 8 female) with no history of ACL reconstruction or any other lower extremity surgery (Age years; height:; massserved as a matched control group based on sex, height, mass, age, and activity level. Kinematic data was collected during both tasks; participants completed five single leg squats and two side step cutting tasks on each leg. The means across were determined and correlated between tasks. Independent sample t-tests were used to determine any significance between groups. RESULTS: Individuals {{with a history of}} ACL reconstruction squatted and cut with significantly less sagittal plane motion compared to healthy controls. Healthy controls also cut with more trunk rotation towards the direction of travel and higher VGRF compared to individuals with a history of ACLR. Numerous correlations were seen between tasks. CONCLUSION: Sagittal, frontal, and transverse plane motion during the SLS were predictive of motion during the SSC. Lack of frontal and transverse plane trunk, hip, and knee control during the SLS resulted in positions of increased lateral trunk flexion, hip adduction, and medial knee displacement during a cutting task. The SLS {{can be used as a}} clinical predictor of SSC in athletes during injury prevention or return to play rehabilitation.
