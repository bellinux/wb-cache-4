25|$|Mortal sins must be confessed {{by naming}} the <b>specific</b> <b>offence</b> along with {{how many times}} it was committed. It is not {{necessary}} to confess venial sins although they may be confessed, a practice that began with the Irish monks around the 12th century. Venial sins are all sins that are not mortal. The Church encourages frequent, intelligent use of the sacrament of confession even if a person has only venial sins, in view of the benefits that might be derived.|$|E

[...] The minimum legal age for a prostitute in Ireland is 18 years (child prostitution legislation exists to protect persons under this age). The Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill 2006 came into force making {{trafficking in persons}} {{for the purpose of}} their sexual exploitation a <b>specific</b> <b>offence,</b> though previous legislation already covered much of this area.|$|E

2500|$|In pre-colonial times, {{customary}} African law comprised {{a flexible}} {{set of rules}} on conduct and social obligations which was accepted by the community. Customary African law has been typified by [...] as {{more concerned with the}} resolution of disputes than the punishment of crimes. Many systems of customary African law have little recognition of crimes, {{in the sense of a}} <b>specific</b> <b>offence</b> committed against, and prosecuted by, a society as opposed to torts or civil wrongs to be pursued by the individual affected as a plaintiff. Some offences, for example patricide, incest or witchcraft were, however, so serious as to be regarded as crimes against the community involving the death of those guilty. Although it has sometimes been claimed that, because of its flexibility and basis in custom, it was not really law, experts in African legal systems such as Eugene Cotran have demonstrated it was. Cotran also showed that, despite some informality, assemblies of people meeting to administer customary law are clearly courts. However, in the colonial period, English law and legal procedures were introduced and given priority over customary Law, which tended to be labelled “native law”, “local law” or “traditional law”. Europeans also sought to codify these laws, which as a result, became increasingly rigid.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{a company}} {{formally}} enters an insolvency procedure, three main rules regulate directors' behaviour to discourage running up unnecessary debts at creditors' expense. First, directors (whether real, de facto, or shadow directors) will commit a criminal offence if they dishonestly keep the company running to defraud creditors. [...] "Fraudulent trading" [...] under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 213, requires that a director is actually dishonest, under {{the standard of}} R v Ghosh: the director must have acted dishonestly by ordinary standards, and must have recognised that. The sum of money a director {{may have to pay}} for the offence is not in itself punitive, but rather compensates for the losses incurred in the period when she or he dishonestly kept the company running. In Morphites v Bernasconi Chadwick LJ decided it was not the intention of Parliament to enact a punitive element for damages under section 213 itself. Instead, under the Companies Act 2006 section 993, there is a separate <b>specific</b> <b>offence</b> of fraudulent trading, carrying a fine of up to £10,000. Beyond the directors, anyone who is knowingly party to the fraud will also be liable. Before someone can be an accessory to fraud, there must be an initial finding or allegation that a principal had acted wrongfully. So in Re Augustus Barnett & Son Ltd Hoffmann J struck out a liquidator's suit for fraudulent trading against the Spanish wine manufacturer, Rumasa SA, which was the parent of Barnett & Son, because although it had given a comfort letter for its subsidiary's debts, and although the subsidiary was advised that a fraudulent trading charge may arise, that had not actually been alleged yet. Fraudulent trading depends on [...] "real moral blame" [...] attributable to someone.|$|E

The Act was modified, amended or extended by later legislation, for example the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883.|$|R
50|$|The penal codes contain only {{rules that}} {{prescribe}} punishments for <b>specific</b> <b>offences,</b> rules that define generally {{the allocation of}} punishment, or those that establish principles of interpretation. Each offence was allocated a specific punishment. The task of the magistrate was to identify the proper name of the offence disclosed by the facts. Determination of the correct punishment automatically followed.|$|R
5000|$|Misconduct {{may occur}} at any time, and {{need not be}} against an opponent. Whilst the {{offences}} that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad.

50|$|There {{may have}} been no <b>specific</b> <b>offence</b> of {{infanticide}} in England before about 1623 because infanticide was a matter for the by ecclesiastical courts, possibly because infant mortality from natural causes was high (about 15% or one in six).|$|E

50|$|A foul {{occurs when}} a player commits a <b>specific</b> <b>offence</b> against an opponent, for example {{handling}} the ball, tripping an opponent, barging an opponent in the back, pulling at an opponent's shirt, etc., are punishable by a free kick depending on where the offence occurred.|$|E
5000|$|Section 12 {{states that}} [...] "everyone {{has the right}} not to be {{subjected}} to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment."

5000|$|Measures to {{introduce}} a <b>specific</b> <b>offence</b> of [...] "incitement to religious hatred" [...] were included in early drafts of the Act, but then dropped so the bill would pass before the 2005 general election.

5000|$|The {{powers of}} the police in Scotland, as with all Scots {{criminal}} law, are heavily based on common law. There is no statutary equivalent to e.g. the general powers of arrest in England and Wales [...] but individual statutes might confer a power for <b>specific</b> <b>offences</b> where the general power of arrest might not otherwise be available. In consequence the general powers available to constables are found summarised in legal textbooks rather than statute.|$|R

In 2000, the age of consent for male same-sex sexual acts was lowered to 18. In 2010, the States of Guernsey backed, in principle, a proposal to equalise the age of consent at 16. Legislation to this effect was approved in 2011 and took effect on 5 November 2012. However, Guernsey retains some male homosexual <b>specific</b> <b>offences</b> in its criminal law.|$|R

50|$|As each Australian state enacts its own laws, {{general law}} {{enforcement}} duties are {{the responsibility of}} state police forces, who are in turn responsible to a government minister (usually the Minister for Police). These forces carry out the bulk of general policing throughout the entire state, including in metropolitan areas. Other state-government departments may also have investigative powers for <b>specific</b> <b>offences</b> within their purview. The Northern Territory also has its own police force, but in Australia's other territories (including the Australian Capital Territory) law enforcement is handled by the federal government.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the failure}} of the Stalking Bill to be enacted, an offence of [...] "harassment" [...] was later created in England and Wales by the {{enactment}} of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which came into force on June 16, 1997. In Scots law, the 1997 act also created a civil remedy through non-harassment orders. The Protection from Harassment Act was later amended by the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, which added to it the <b>specific</b> <b>offences</b> of [...] "stalking" [...] and [...] "stalking involving fear of violence or serious alarm or distress".|$|R
