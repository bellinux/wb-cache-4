40|$|Working Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) The United States, the EU, and {{virtually}} all European nations undertook <b>solemn</b> <b>commitments</b> to promote small business access to public procurement and R&D programs {{as part of the}} 2000 OECD Bologna Charter on Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) Policies. Notwithstanding these mutual commitments, the Europeans have continued challenging America''s Small Business Act of 1953 and the set-asides it authorizes as unfair barriers to trade. Thus far, the United States has resisted the criticism. To put the transatlantic debate over small business contracting into concrete terms, this article compares European and US approaches to small business procurement assistance. Subjects of comparison include approaches to defining a small business concern; creation of small business procurement assistance agencies; availability of suitable contracts through reductions in bundling and consolidation; small business goals and set-asides; contracting with small firms for economic sustainability and remedial purposes; measures to enhance transparency and availability of public procurement information for small firms; small business subcontracting policies; and use of public procurement to stimulate innovation. The article notes that Europe is competing with the United States for best SME assistance policies. It concludes that the main elements of European and US policies to support SME access to public procurement and R&D are very similar and are continuing to further converge. Accordingly, EU trade complaints are without substantial merit. Indeed, both sides in this debate have legitimate reasons to help their small contractors, both sides have weaknesses in their SME policies, and both sides can learn from each other''s best practices.

These agreements are powerful tools to foster competition in the private sector and reduce prices for consumers in developing countries. This chapter provides an overview of the following types of major agreements—confidential-ity, material transfer, development (in which the licensee is responsible for further development), co-development (in which two parties collaborate on continued develop-ment), and distribution—explains the functions of those agreements, and suggests strategies for their effective use. The chapter also discusses the meaning and usefulness of the standard elements and formulas found in such agree-ments. It explains the meaning and significance of the terms and language used and discusses such key issues as product liability, fees and royalties, and arbitration. The chapter emphasizes the importance of establishing and maintaining trust when negotiating and implementing agreements. HANDBOOK OF BEST PRACTICES | responsible for further development), co-develop-ment (in which two parties collaborate on contin-ued development), and distribution. Most agreements are between two parties, but some may involve three or more parties. The public sector agency or the negotiating party may provide the first draft of an agreement for nego-tiation. Whoever writes the first draft often has the advantage, so public sector agencies should, whenever possible, take the initiative to prepare the agreement. Regardless of who provides the first draft, the proposal should adhere to the principle of good negotiations: offer an agreement that you would be willing to sign, if you were the other party. A good agreement benefits both parties. For an agreement to work, the two parties must trust each other and maintain this trust throughout the implementation of the agreement. With a high level of trust, moreover, a request to renegotiate by either party may be better received should cir-cumstances change. Finally, since enforcing inter-national agreements through legal remedies may be difficult, such agreements should be considered <b>solemn</b> <b>commitments</b> that must be observed...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 15 years, {{intellectual}} property rights (IPRs) -patents, copyrights, and trademarks-have moved from an arcane area of legal analysis and a policy backwater {{to the forefront of}} global economic policymaking. In the 1990 s dozens of countries unilaterally strengthened their laws and regulations in this area, and many others are poised to do likewise. At the multilateral level, the successful conclusion of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) in the World Trade Organization elevates the protection and enforcement of IPRs to the level of <b>solemn</b> international <b>commitment.</b> The new global IPR system comes with both benefits and costs. Stronger IPRs protection should increase incentives for innovation and raise returns to international technology transfer. However, it also could raise the costs of acquiring new technology and products, shifting the global terms of trade in favor of technology producers and against technology consumers. In this context, the new regime raises international economic policy questions that evoke impassioned and exaggerated claims from both advocates and opponents of IPRs, particularly concerning sensitive issues such as patent protection of pharmaceuticals and biotechnological inventions, and copyright protection for internet transactions. In the first comprehensive economic assessment of the effects of stronger international IPRs, Keith E. Maskus examines these competing claims through an analysis of the economic effects of extended international protection and partial harmonization of IPRs. He presents findings on the potential effects of stronger global IPRs, including likely impacts on foreign direct investment, technology transfer, and pricing under enhanced market power. The results bear directly on several important policy questions, including the construction of complementary initiatives on market liberalization and competition rules, and Maskus discusses whether priority attention should be devoted to them in the upcoming next round of global trade talks. ...|$|R

40|$|International audiencehe {{right to}} {{education}} and academic success of all are the concerns of all time regardless of the contexts (UNESCO, 2008). Unfortunately, despite the <b>solemn</b> affirmations and <b>commitments</b> to education for all and inclusive education, {{the question of the}} effectiveness of including all-out pupils with disabilities remains a relatively unexplored topic. Inclusive education implies a paradigm shift in which the conditions for success are based on the ability of the school to adapt to the diversity of the public it hosts (Plaisance, Belmont, Verillon et al., 2007; Dyson, Millward et al., 1999). Some researchers (Armstrong, 2001; Ainscow, 2003) showed that if educational policies are formulated around the differences of pupils, they favor inclusion; such policies in addition to their voluntary nature, should provide mechanisms to the effective management of pupils at school. Therefore, one can question the quality of systems set up in France and Cameroon to host and assist students with disabilities. From the multidimensional evaluation model of the quality of school systems (Tremblay, 2012), quantitative data were collected by questionnaires from 133 teachers in France and Cameroon. The ANOVA test is used for the comparison of means between the two countries. The results show points of similarities and significant differences that will be presented and discussed...|$|R

[...] As in the Fitzmorris case, Gonzales ruled that Dumas had not proved his case of election fraud and ordered the payment of court costs and legal fees to Jetson. Coincidentally, Jetson died shortly after taking his oath of office as a state representative. In another case, Malina v. Gonzales, the judge, while on the 19th Judicial District Court, was himself sued in 1988 regarding a highway incident with Thomas Martin Malina (born June 1957) of Baton Rouge. Malina signaled Judge Gonzales, not knowing his identity, for allegedly driving at a slower rate in the [...] "fast lane" [...] of a highway and motioned for the driver to move into the left lane. Gonzales apparently became irritated at Malina and turned on his flashing light and told Malina that he had the authority to arrest him, but Malina fled the scene. Judge Gonzales then sent a police officer privately to Malina's home to request that Malina appear the next day in court. Gonzales told Malina that he had arrest authority and charged him with multiple counts, [...] "fleeing to allude," [...] "resisting an officer," [...] "public endangerment," [...] "disobeying an officer," [...] "reckless driving," [...] and [...] "leaving the scene." [...] Malina said that he questioned the flashing light from an unmarked vehicle. Gonzales cited Malina for contempt of court. Malina was handcuffed, fingerprinted, photographed, and jailed for five hours. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans held on appeal in 1993 that Judge Gonzales lacked legal authority to arrest Malina but did have qualified immunity from Malina's suit and the legal power to charge Malina with contempt and to hold him for five hours.|$|E

40|$|In Sparrow, the Supreme Court of Canada {{stated that}} ss. 35 (1) is “a <b>solemn</b> <b>commitment</b> {{that must be}} given {{meaningful}} content” the objective {{of which is to}} ensure that Aboriginal rights “are taken seriously. ” Despite such a clear directive from the highest court, in Manitoba Métis Federation v. Canada [2007], MacInnes J. of the Queen’s Bench of Manitoba seemed incapable of taking seriously the Aboriginal title of the Métis under s. 31 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, and in no way thought of its explicit recognition as ‘a <b>solemn</b> <b>commitment</b> that must be given meaningful content’. For his part, if Scott C. J. of the Manitoba Court of Appeal was able to find a ‘cognizable Aboriginal interest’ in the expression ‘Indian title’, and thereby recognize to some extent Métis Aboriginal rights, he seemed incapable of conceiving such interests as title. This thesis is basically an attempt to ‘take seriously’ the common law Aboriginal title of the Métis. In order to do so, it first looks at the treatment of the concept of Indian title and the Royal Proclamation, 1763, in the lower courts throughout the infamous St. Catharine’s Milling and Lumber case. Subsequently, the existing common law doctrines of inherent Métis rights, those of the derivative rights doctrine, the empty box doctrine and the distinct Aboriginal people doctrine are all found to be inadequate to the task of providing cogency to the ‘constitutional imperative’ that was evoked in Powley. A fourth doctrine is therefore proposed, that of a Métis Autochthonous or Indigenous rights doctrine. In light of this, it is argued that the recognition of the ‘Indian’ title in s. 31 was not a mere ‘political expediency’ but is rooted in the underlying constitutional principle of the protection of minorities. Furthermore, insofar as the ‘Indian’ title of the Métis is taken seriously, it can be seen as having been extinguished through the federal power over ‘lands reserved for Indians’ under ss. 91 (24). The legal implication is that they were, in the logic of the times, basically enfranchised ‘Indians’. Finally, by applying the grid established in Sioui for determining the existence of a ‘treaty’, it is argued that s. 31 is a ‘treaty’ or land claims settlement within the meaning of s. 35...|$|E

Following this presidential initiative, Mrs Bachelot Narquin, the then Minister of Ecology and Sustainable Development instructed Professor Yves Coppens (a paleonthologist and professor at the Collège de France) to preside over a commission, the mission of which was to analyse the economic, legal, social and environmental stakes of the proposed Charter and, {{on the basis of}} this analysis, to draft the Charter (See Rapport de la Commission Coppens de Préparation de la Charte de l’Environnement (8 April 2003) (the Coppens report).
