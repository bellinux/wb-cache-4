40|$|Stockpiling of <b>scrap</b> <b>tyres</b> is a {{significant}} environmental hazard. In recent years, considerable amount of research attentions have been devoted to explore viable solutions to the recycle and reuse <b>scrap</b> <b>tyres</b> in Civil Engineering projects. At present, only a relatively small amount of <b>scrap</b> <b>tyres</b> {{has been used in}} Civil Engineering applications compared to the amount of <b>scrap</b> <b>tyres</b> generated annually. Experimental investigation reports suggest that inclusion of tyre chips (TCh) in sand increases the shear strength and decreases the dilatancy of sand, implying a promising and environmentally sustainable use of the sand-tyre chip (STCh) mixtures in Civil Engineering applications. The reuse of <b>scrap</b> <b>tyres</b> as tyre chips in sand (STCh mixtures) can effectively address the growing environmental concerns {{and at the same time}} provide solutions to geotechnical problems associated with low soil shear strength and high dilatancy. In this thesis, the monotonic behaviour of STCh mixtures has been investigated. Importantly, three behavioural zones of STCh mixtures have been identified: sand-like, sand-rubber, and rubber like. The experimental investigation results of a series of monotonic triaxial tests on sand mixed with varying proportions of TCh demonstrate that TCh increase the shear strength and decrease the dilatancy o f sand. The effects of confinement and relative density on the shear strength, dilatancy, and initial tangent modulus of the STCh mixtures have also been investigated. These tests demonstrate that the greatest improvement is obtained in the sand-rubber behavioural zone in which sand and tyre chips (TCh) form the skeleton of the mixture. Considering the importance of a suitable constitutive model for wide applications of STCh mixture in Civil Engineering applications, a semi-empirical constitutive model for STCh mixtures has been developed based on a critical state framework incorporating the constant stress ratio (CSR) and the state parameters (^), which captures the key features exhibited by the STCh mixtures during shear loading. The model has been validated with the results of extensive laboratory investigations. The developed semi-empirical model can effectively simulate the monotonic behaviour of STCh mixtures. Recently, STCh mixtures were proposed to be used for seismic isolation of low-tomedium- rise buildings. In such seismic isolation methods, a large amount of <b>scrap</b> <b>tyres</b> can be reused in an environmentally friendly way. Moreover, it was reported that <b>scrap</b> <b>tyres</b> can reduce the liquefaction potential of sand. However, investigations into the cyclic behaviour and dynamic properties of STCh mixtures are limited. In this study, the effects of the gravimetric proportion of TCh, the cyclic shear strain, and the number of cycles on the cyclic behaviour of STCh mixtures (such as liquefaction potential and maximum shear stress) have been investigated by strain control cyclic triaxial tests. The dynamic properties (shear modulus and damping ratio) of STCh mixtures for a medium to a large range of shear strain levels (0. 15 % to 0. 50 %) have also been determined. The importance o f the monotonic and the cyclic behaviours together with the static and dynamic properties of STCh mixtures presented in this thesis is paramount, especially in increasing the confidence for the use of tyre chips in Civil Engineering applications. Hence, the reuse of potentially hazardous <b>scrap</b> <b>tyres</b> can be significantly increased by the environmentally friendly and sustainable applications of STCh mixtures in Civil Engineering applications...|$|E

Both compressive strength and flexural strength of pervious concrete containing STT showed a lower value compared to the control mix without STT.

A preliminary study of micronised tyre combustion was undertaken to identify the suitable size ranges for application in NOx reduction by reburning.

The material may be used in various forms and sizes – from powder, through granulates, tyre shreds, chips. The TDA applications include: lightweight fills in embankments over soft soils, lightweight backfills behind retaining walls, insulation and drainage layers etc. In most of the works the material needs to be compacted to decrease the void ratio of the aggregate and reduce future settlement. This paper presents a study on compactness of four different fractions of <b>scrap</b> <b>tyre</b> rubber (A: 0. 1 – 1 mm, B: 0. 5 – 2 mm, C: 2 – 5 mm and D: 10 – 40 mm) in the standard Proctor test. The results in the form of dependency of dry and bulk density on water content are compared also with adequate results obtained for a clean uniform medium sand.

The effects of temperature and steam to carbon ratio were investigated through thermodynamic equilibrium calculations of the main aromatic, aliphatic and hetero-N and -S compounds known {{to be present in}} STPO. The optimum operating conditions in a packed bed reactor with a Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst at atmospheric pressure and molar steam to carbon ratio of 4 : 1 were 750 °C at a WHSV of 0. 82 h - 1. The maximum hydrogen yield was 26. 4 wt% of the STPO feedstock, corresponding to 67 % of the maximum theoretical yield, compared to 79. 4 % predicted at equilibrium for a model mixture of 22 STPO compounds in the same conditions. The selectivity to the H-containing products was 98 % H 2 and 2 % CH 4, respectively, indicating little undesirable by-product formation, and comparable to equilibrium values. The potential to optimize the process to enhance further the H 2 yield was explored via feasibility tests of chemical looping reforming (CLR) aimed at lowering the heating and purification costs of the hydrogen production from STPO. However, the hydrogen yield decreased with each cycle of CLR. Analysis of the catalyst indicated this was most likely due to deactivation by carbon accumulation and sulphur originally present in the oil, and possibly also by trace elements (Ca, Na). The NiO particles in the catalyst were also shown to have grown after CLR of STPO. Hence further development would require pre-treating the oil for removal of sulphur, and use of a catalyst more tolerant to carbon formation...|$|R

40|$|The UK {{produces}} {{nearly half}} a million tonnes of <b>scrap</b> <b>tyres</b> each year and {{there is a need to}} develop a robust, sustainable disposal and recovery capacity to deal effectively with existing and projected tyre arisings. Sufficient capacity is needed to address the large quantity of tyres stored in stockpiles and the implications of the landfill Directive, which will ban the disposal of whole tyres in 2003. Currently over 70 % of <b>scrap</b> <b>tyres</b> produced are recovered through a variety of markets. The bulk of tyres not recovered are currently disposed of legally to landfill, but the final destination of a significant number of tyres is uncertain. Unfortunately rising costs of tyre disposal has increased the financial incentive for illegal disposal, such as large scale dumping or localised fly tipping. Illegal activity has the potential to jeopardise the disposal and recovery network if not addressed through robust enforcement. The Agency has been aware of the environmental problems associated with the disposal of used tyres for many years, and has been involved in a number of initiatives, including the production of a report ‘tyres in the environment ’ in 1998 to influence the debate. The Agency has recognised the magnitude of the problem and we are currently developing a Tyres Campaign in partnership with the tyre industry. The aim of the campaign is...|$|E
40|$|Lightly {{cemented}} <b>scrap</b> rubber <b>tyre</b> chips {{have been}} proposed as a ductile, porous and lightweight geomaterial for various engineering applications. Both drained and undrained triaxial compression tests on the material were conducted. Despite the high flexibility of the rubber chips and hence their higher ductility, the material behaviour {{was found to be}} generally similar to that of typical cemented soils. Data points with the same deviatoric strain in p'-q space were linked up to form a series of equideviatoric strain lines, and a degradable cohesion intercept is observed in the plot. There was also a tentative critical state line in p'-q-e space (e being the void ratio) that was consistent with the corresponding 'parent soil' (unbonded, cement-coated chips). In an unloading-reloading stress-strain curve the unloading path was practically identical to the reloading path in a constant-p' test, but more curved in a consolidated drained test...|$|R
40|$|Community {{awareness}} of environmental noise has increased {{and there is}} a higher expectation for local government to reduce noise levels. In order to solve the noise problem, many engineers develop different types of material for sound absorption. Rubbersoil is one of the developing materials. It is a kind of lightweight geo-material, which incorporates rubber chips derived from <b>scrap</b> rubber <b>tyres</b> and bonded with cementitious material. Fine rubber powder and large rubber chips have their specific characteristics towards sound adsorption. Fine rubber tyre powder undergoes porous absorber mechanism and absorbs high frequency sound, while large and higher proportion of rubber tyre chips provide air gaps and enhance sound absorption at low frequencies. A proper combination of these two types of rubber tyre would give satisfactory sound absorption for noises at a wide range of frequencies. With the potential benefits of rubber powder and rubber chips for sound absorption, Rubbersoil can be developed as an effective noise absorption material. Moreover, high damping property of Rubbersoil allows it to form barrier trenches around vibration sensitive foundations and structures (such as factories for sensitive, precision, and high-tech electronic industries) in order to insulate it from strong ground excitation induced from various dynamic sources. This research involves laboratory testing, panel modeling and possibly field testing in verifying and understanding the vibration and noise absorption characteristics of Rubbersoil...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} carbon dioxide partial {{pressure}} and fluidization velocity on activated carbons produced by carbon dioxide activation of <b>scrap</b> car <b>tyre</b> rubber in a fluidized bed has been studied. The method consisted of carbonization at 700 C under nitrogen followed by activation at 900 C. Three types of activated carbons were produced using activated gas concentrations of 20, 60 and 100 % carbon dioxide by volume, the rest nitrogen, at a constant fluidization velocity (0. 0393 m/s) to investigate the influence {{of carbon dioxide}} partial pressure. Within the experimental setup and activation time of 4 h, {{it was observed that}} BET surface area and total pore volume increased with carbon dioxide partial pressure reaching 732. 80 m / g and 1. 1030 cm / g, respectively, for 100 % activation with carbon dioxide. Three other types of activated carbons were produced using 100 % carbon dioxide at two (0. 0393 m/s), three (0. 0589 m/s) and four (0. 0786 m/s) times the minimum fluidization velocity (U). The BET surface area and total pore volume were observed to increase with fluidization velocity (which can be viewed as an indicator of the intensity of mixing in the bed), reaching 1011 m / g and 1. 5620 cm / g, respectively, at four times the minimum fluidization velocity...|$|R
