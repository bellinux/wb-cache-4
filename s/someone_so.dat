5|$|According to Diddy, {{the song}} is about loving <b>someone</b> <b>so</b> much that you forget about yourself. It is a R tune, which {{integrates}} usage of electronica and hip-hop influences, while having a melodic, piano-laden background. The song's official remix features American rappers Gucci Mane and Red Cafe, while rapper and producer Jermaine Dupri also recorded a remix to the song. While critics were divided over Diddy's part in the track, most complimented the song's production, Drake's cameo, and Harper and Richard's vocals.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{appears to}} have been unimpressed by this plan. She felt that marrying the son of a count diminished her {{imperial}} status and was probably also unhappy about marrying <b>someone</b> <b>so</b> much younger than she was; Matilda was 25 and Geoffrey was only 13. Hildebert, the Archbishop of Tours, eventually intervened to persuade her {{to go along with the}} engagement. Matilda finally agreed, and she travelled to Rouen in May 1127 with Robert of Gloucester and Brian Fitz Count where she was formally betrothed to Geoffrey. Over the course of the next year, Fulk decided to depart for Jerusalem, where he hoped to become king, leaving his possessions to Geoffrey. Henry knighted his future son-in-law, and Matilda and Geoffrey were married a week later on 17 June 1128 in Le Mans by the bishops of Le Mans and Séez. Fulk finally left Anjou for Jerusalem in 1129, declaring Geoffrey the Count of Anjou and Maine.|$|E

25|$|Lindbergh's Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer, A. Scott Berg, {{contended that}} Lindbergh {{was not so}} much a {{supporter}} of the Nazi regime as <b>someone</b> <b>so</b> stubborn in his convictions and relatively inexperienced in political maneuvering that he easily allowed rivals to portray him as one. Lindbergh's receipt of the German medal was approved without objection by the American embassy; the war had not yet begun in Europe. The award did not cause controversy until the war began and Lindbergh returned to the United States in 1939 to spread his message of nonintervention. Berg contended Lindbergh's views were commonplace in the United States in the pre–World War II era. Lindbergh's support for the America First Committee was representative of the sentiments of a number of American people.|$|E

[...] Murphy said Fischer was portrayed as [...] "a petulant child who's {{in need of a}} lot of attention from his father, he has everything he could ever want materially, but he's deeply lacking emotionally". The actor also researched the sons of Rupert Murdoch, [...] "to add to that the idea of living in the shadow of <b>someone</b> <b>so</b> immensely powerful".|$|E

The Disney Channel promos for Phineas and Ferb describe him as someone who [...] "thinks big", refusing to let any day be ordinary. Povenmire also characterizes him as assertive, <b>someone</b> <b>so</b> secure in his abilities that others assume he is a prodigy. Povenmire and Marsh wanted the series to reflect their own childhood memories of going out {{during the summer and}} have fun, digging trenches and building tunnels, forts, and tree houses.|$|E

While driving together the pair flirt, although the protagonist finds it difficult to overcome his reluctance: [...] "I would go out tonight, but I haven't got a stitch to wear". The motorist tells the cyclist: [...] "it's gruesome that <b>someone</b> <b>so</b> handsome should care".|$|E
500|$|... "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Britney Spears for her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time (1999). It was released on December 15, 1999 by Jive Records as the fifth and final single from the album. After Spears recorded an unused song from Toni Braxton and sent it through Larry Rudolph to several labels, executives from Jive Records commented {{that it was very}} rare to hear <b>someone</b> <b>so</b> young who could deliver emotional content and commercial appeal, appointing the singer to work with producer Eric Foster White. The teen pop ballad was written and produced by White, and features Spears singing about the loss of a first love and how breaking up can be hard.|$|E

So they just hate themselves right in that moment, they can't stand , they regret everything that they did and they wish they could change things." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe noted the chorus of [...] "Me Haces Falta" [...] to be self-loathing, with the lines: [...] "Tú me haces falta/Sí, me arrepiento/Me odio/Estoy desesperada" [...] (English: [...] "I miss you/Yes, I repent/I hate myself/I'm desperate"). Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly praised the song's lyrics, but dismissed the song's production, stating {{that it does not}} live up the song's [...] "florid, romance-novel lyrics".|$|E

Her vocal performance received negative reviews and a media backlash. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found it [...] "refreshing to see <b>someone</b> <b>so</b> gifted make the occasional flub" [...] and described Swift as [...] "the most important new pop star {{of the past few}} years". Swift became the youngest ever artist to be named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association. Fearless also won the Association's Album of the Year award.|$|E
500|$|The single, [...] "Say I", is an {{inspirational}} and motivational record; Milian {{wanted to make}} a record that would be an inspiration to both her and her fans. Focusing on an urban audience, Milian said the record was [...] "way more an urban record than anything I've ever done." [...] The singer felt it was necessary to have Young Jeezy feature because he spoke for the streets, and thought his rap was [...] "a very real message. It pertained to his life." [...] The track, [...] "Twisted", {{was one of the first}} songs recorded for the album. Lyrically, the song is about liking <b>someone</b> <b>so</b> much that you [...] "can't even go about [...] day in a normal way".

Novakovic also explained that it is [...] "quite challenging" [...] to play <b>someone</b> <b>so</b> different from herself, but it is fun. She also hoped that she is not as irritating as Natasha in real life and added [...] "I'm not a manipulative teenage girl who's forever wanting everything her own way."

So, maybe it'll only sell a million singles and reach No. 2", giving the song three-and-a-half stars. Daryl Addison of Great American Country praised the song, saying that [...] "even with heavy thematic elements, the songs impressively maintain a pop/crossover shine and accessible sound, courtesy of Carrie's pristine voice and modern delivery." [...] Writing for Country Universe, Kevin Coyne gave the song an A, complimenting the singer's versatility, saying that [...] "it's a credit to her ambition as an artist. For <b>someone</b> <b>so</b> frequently accused of getting to the top without having to earn it, she continues to work harder than the rest of her peers just to stay there." ...|$|E

[...] The review also praised [...] "her reverberant chest voice [...] her head voice, hitting the highest register with intonation and purity" [...] and echoed Janis: [...] "That she continues to be greeted with skepticism is unfair. ... Yes, the concert showed that Jackie is a young girl, yet one with artistry to be appreciated now without debating about what her future might hold." [...] Antony Walker, Pittsburgh Opera's music director, said: [...] "she has a very sincere way of singing. ... Her voice has a lovely quality to it. It's very simple singing but it comes from the heart. You rarely hear <b>someone</b> <b>so</b> young with such a beautiful voice". Nekesa Mumbi Moody, writing for Associated Press, commented that, although [...] "there is a youthful quality in Jackie's voice, it's hardly childlike: It's a soprano that deftly traverses the musical scales". Mark Kanny, in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, called her voice [...] "beautifully in tune and well supported. ... Evancho's sincerity of delivery was affecting".|$|E
500|$|Feldman's {{article in}} the Western Journal of Medicine {{was picked up by}} The New York Times in a story by Denise Grady, who {{described}} three cases of Internet forum members who were [...] "incorrigible fakers". These include a woman with a professed eating disorder who posted to a support group saying she was reporting from an intensive care unit via her laptop computer, and claimed to have had a stroke while online, to be followed by her mother's posts declaring that she too had to be hospitalized; the original poster's father purportedly continued to update the online group. In another example, a teenager frequenting a forum for mothers with premature infants – some of whom had endured lengthy, expensive, and painful medical procedures, or had died – claimed to have given birth to a premature baby and expressed her fears for her own child, after which she received support and sympathy from the 400-member group. The teenager confided to the group that her baby had also died, and soon after returned to the forum to announce she was again pregnant and feared her baby would be premature, which it turned out to be, more frail this time than the first. Forum members eventually became unsympathetic with her vivid descriptions of surgeries and confronted her. Grady also addresses a similar confrontation that occurred when a man who claimed to be a monk with end-stage cancer posted long descriptions of his trials and struggles with facing death alone, eventually arousing the suspicions of other forum members who were not convinced <b>someone</b> <b>so</b> sick could correspond with so much vitality.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{wrote the}} lyric of the 1988 song [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] as a {{meditation}} {{on the idea of}} commitment. He later said, [...] "'s clearly about a younger version of myself and my relationship with Ali," [...] and added that by nature he was a wanderer, not a family man, and that [...] "The only reason I'm here is because I met <b>someone</b> <b>so</b> extraordinary that I just couldn't let that go." [...] U2 lyrics usually have several possible levels of interpretation, and it is not always possible to definitively ascribe Hewson's influence upon them, but music writer Niall Stokes believes that inspiration from Hewson is pronounced throughout the group's 1997 album Pop, particularly on [...] "Staring at the Sun", which he believes reflects her Chernobyl Children's Project involvement and the feelings of both danger and hopefulness that it triggered in Bono. Stokes also believes that the 2000 song [...] "When I Look at the World" [...] is an explicit acknowledgement of Hewson's strength and commitment as exemplified by that Chernobyl work, while others think it is about Jesus or God. Bono has seemed to deflect those interpretations, saying that song is in part a hard-edged look at himself from the eyes of one losing faith. In any case, Bono has said that he does not feel constrained in his writing or interviews by what Hewson might think, as [...] " [...] doesn't read newspapers. Or listen to the radio. There's a mysterious distance between us." [...] Not known for being musical herself, Hewson did perform Lady Gaga's [...] "Telephone", as a duet with her husband, to serenade their daughter Eve at her 21st birthday celebration at a club in Las Vegas in 2012.|$|E
