40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been conducted to determine the stability and control characteristics of a 0. 13 -scale free-flight model of the Convair XFY- 1 airplane during take-offs and landings in steady winds. The tests indicated that take-offs in headwinds up to at least 20 knots (full scale) will be fairly easy to perform although the airplane may be blown downstream as much as 3 spans before a trim condition can be established. The distance that the airplane will be blown down-stream can be reduced by restraining the upwind landing gear until the instant of take-off. The tests also indicated that spot landings in headwinds up to at least 30 knots (full scale) and in crosswinds up to at least 20 knots (full scale) can be accomplished with reasonable accuracy although, during the landing approach, {{there will probably be}} an undesirable nosing-up tendency caused by ground effect and by the change in angle of attack resulting from vertical descent. Some form of arresting gear will probably be required to prevent the airplane from rolling downwind or tipping over after contact. This rolling and tipping can be prevented by a <b>snubbing</b> <b>line</b> attached to the tip of the upwind' wing or tail or by an arresting gear consisting of a wire mesh on the ground and hooks on the landing gear to engage the mesh...|$|E
