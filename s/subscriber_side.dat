30|$|The {{implementation}} of the DDS protocol in micROS-drt mainly consists of two modules as shown in Fig.  4 : the DDS abstraction/bridge module and the underlying DDS middleware. The former {{can be regarded as}} “glue” between other parts in micROS-drt and the DDS middleware. It consists of three sub-modules: (1) DDS capability abstraction, which encapsulates the capability of the underlying DDS middleware as well as manages the lifetime of all DDS-related resources; (2) Data distribution model mapping, which maps the micROS-drt data distribution model to the DDS data distribution model, including the mapping of both topics and QoS parameters; and (3) Message tunneling, which encapsulates the messages that are marshaled by the message layer into a DDS message at the publisher side and extracts it from the DDS message at the <b>subscriber</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
30|$|This {{experiment}} validates a major real-time {{capability of}} micROS-drt, that is, the message transport priority management. Two servers are {{connected by a}} virtual network over the 3 G cellular network. Three topics are advertised with different priorities at the publisher side, {{and each of them}} sends messages with 5  KB length continuously. Sending many messages of this kind in a short time window results in network congestion, especially with a cellular network that has limited bandwidth. The experiment is terminated when 300 messages have been received at the <b>subscriber</b> <b>side,</b> and the arrived messages in each topic are counted. Figure  5 e shows that with real-time assurance support, the topic with high priority delivers 173 messages and the low priority one delivers only 17 messages successfully. As a comparison, in the same experiment on ROS which has no transport priority support, the arrived messages are distributed evenly among those three topics.|$|E

30|$|The DDS standard, {{which has}} been denounced by the users, has hard-to-use APIs. It {{introduces}} more than 20 policies to define the QoS of the data distribution process. Furthermore, different policy combinations result in different effects. To avoid confusing the users of micROS-drt with those complex policies, micROS-drt chooses not to directly expose the DDS APIs directly and introduces a more practical and simplified real-time data distribution model (cf. Sect. “Real‑time data distribution model for robots”) instead. The QoS-enabled APIs of this model are {{an extension of the}} APIs in ROS, which have been widely accepted by the robotic community. The real-time parameters are classified into two kinds: The parameters should be set at the publisher side and the ones should be set at the <b>subscriber</b> <b>side.</b> The users can specify the parameters independently in the ROS-style APIs on both sides or just use their default values while advertising or subscribing a topic.|$|E

Responses to Entry in Multi-Sided Markets: The Impact of Craigslist on Local Newspapers How do firms respond to entry in multi-sided markets? We address this question by studying the impact of Craigslist, a website providing classified-advertising services, on local US newspapers. We exploit temporal and geographical variation in Craigslist’s entry to show that newspapers with greater reliance on classified-ad revenue experience a larger drop in classified-ad rates after Craigslist’s entry. The impact of Craigslist’s entry on the classified-ad side appears to propagate to other sides of the newspapers ’ market. On the <b>subscriber</b> <b>side,</b> these newspapers experience an increase in subscription prices, a decrease in circulation, {{and an increase in}} differentiation from each other.

40|$|Abstract — The large radio {{coverage}} of the IEEE 802. 16 standard, widely known as WiMAX, represents a key advantage compared to several first mile solutions proposed so far, while ensuring a rather inexpensive equipment at the <b>subscriber</b> <b>side.</b> The IEEE 802. 16 standard, in practice, {{promises to be a}} flexible solution especially where cabling is not a viable choice, or as an alternative to customary leased lines. Nevertheless, modern requirements to wireless connectivity include mandatory QoS guarantees for a wide set of real-time applications, and this is the case of the ever growing trend of VoIP calls. To this aim, WiMAX supports natively real-time traffic. In this paper, we report the results of a set of measurements performed on the field on a WiMAX Alvarion testbed, located in Turin, Italy. We fed the system with synthetic VoIP traffic, real-time guaranteed, competing with concurrent best effort traffic. We obtained E-model figures, thus characterizing the operation intervals of the system, depending on the codec source and the number of calls. I...|$|E

The CHR node essentially acts like a WiMAX multi-hop system, but with the <b>subscriber</b> <b>side</b> of the WiMAX relay being tunnelled through DSRC to an SS. This leads to some certain optimizations, that is, {{due to the fact that}} the SSs do not need to transmit over the WiMAX channel, the connection information setup is more efficient and is replaced on the DSRC side with an SYNC message that tells the SS stations how busy the WiMAX channel is. This is so that the SS nodes know when and how fast to transmit to the CHR stations. It is recommended that each mobile node have two MAC addresses to readily distinguish between traffic intended for the node itself while operating in SS mode, and traffic intended for other nodes connected to it while operating in CHR mode. Some WiMAX tunnelled traffic is pre-processed at the CHR, especially during a handover session.|$|E

While policy issues related to market structure have been discussed in a number of recent studies of the cable and telephone industries, these writings have concentrated on traditional video and telephony services. 1 Popular data services such as the Internet and America OnLine have emerged only recently, and the role of local infrastructure networks in providing residential access to these services has not yet received much attention. Presciently, in 1983 Pool discussed the market structural issues for residential data services in general terms. 2 This paper builds on and updates his analysis in light of actual data technologies and services that have developed in the intervening 12 years, concluding that more open access to cable networks, on both the <b>subscriber</b> and provider <b>sides</b> of the network, would accelerate the diffusion of high-speed residential Internet access...|$|R

40|$|Fiber-deployment of {{telecommunications}} networks {{is currently a}} great challenge for sector-specific regulators, national governments, {{as well as for}} investing operators. One of the most controversial regulatory issues in Europe (and elsewhere) is whether the emerging next generation access (NGA) infrastructure should be subjected to cost-based access regulation or whether at least a temporary removal of ex ante obligations ("regulatory holidays") should be granted. In answering this question we examine the current and foreseeable EU regulatory framework and show that it does not provide positive incentives for NGA deployment and increasing penetration rates. On the basis of an international comparison with the most recent data on NGA deployment and penetration, it appears, in turn, that deregulatory and/or state aid driven approaches targeted at the demand (<b>subscribers)</b> and supply <b>side</b> (coverage) are more promising.

40|$|International audienceCurrent publish/subscribe systems provide {{very limited}} support to modify {{subscriptions}} dynamically. Consequently, they cannot efficiently control {{the flow of}} events between publishers and subscribers, which may lead to unnecessary network traffic. In addition, {{it is not possible}} to automatically subscribe or unsubscribe to a service depending on certain context of use. This implies for developers to manually manage subscriptions (e. g., taking care of when to cancel or re-issue a subscription), which may result in inappropriate subscription states (e. g., subscriptions that are cancelled too late). In this paper, we propose the concept of dynamic subscription mechanisms that improves the expressiveness and flexibility of subscriptions. We introduce a new dimension to a subscription that allows a subscriber to express the flow of matched events, and when a new subscription can be (re) issued. We validate our claims for improved flexibility and expressiveness by providing language abstractions and a prototype implementation of a dynamic subscription mechanism framework called Flexub that supports a variation of subscription mechanisms. When compared to existing subscription models, our experiment results show that the support for dynamic subscription mechanisms greatly reduces network traffic of events sent from publishers to the subscribers. In addition, our approach reduces the workload on the <b>subscriber</b> <b>side...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies on}} growth of telecomm sector depict an ever rising demand for high {{bandwidth}} {{applications such as}} on-line gaming, high definition television and many more. This demand is coupled with increase in internet connected utilities per house hold - each requiring a portion of bandwidth. The fast development of broadband telecommunication services calls for an upgrade of access infrastructure. This challenge could be met by technologies such as Fiber-To-The-Home/Building (FTTH/B) point-to-multipoint (P 2 MP) optical access networking. Further, FTTH is also widely regarded as a future proof solution for broadband telecommunication services within scientific and industrial sectors. This has encouraged large amount {{of research and development}} throughout the globe to find optimal topologies for FTTH. OFDM based optical access network topology abbreviated as OTONES is an ongoing EU FP 7 project under the PIANO+ framework. The OTONES project addresses the next generation optical access networking on the basis of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Orthogonal Frequency Multiple Access (OFDMA), with special provision for reduced complexity and signal processing aspects of the <b>subscriber</b> <b>side</b> terminals (ONUs). This thesis focuses on the theoretical investigation of OFDM based optical access network topology OTONES. The thesis provides an in depth view of the salient aspects of the topology and formulates the key requirements of OTONES topology. The investigation primarily delves on two important aspects of the topology. First, finding the optimal analog circuitry for the optical network unit (ONU). Second, finding the optimal operation regime for the topology and hence optimizing the system level concept. In this thesis, we show that the requirement of an analog circuitry originates from the need of successive up-conversions in OTONES topology which also produces image spectrum. This image spectrum causes a 3 dB loss in power and spectral efficiency in absence of a proper image rejection circuitry. Thus, we discuss the generic SSB generation methods for efficient image rejection. Novel Bedrosian method based on Bedrosian Theorem is established as a promising method for image rejection. We show that this method is an analog implementation of Hilbert Transform Method and does not involve any approximation. Both generic methods for SSB along with the Novel Bedrosian method are evaluated based on the criterion established for OTONES topology. Finally, optical filtering from the set of generic SSB method is proposed for the downstream path and Novel Bedrosian method is proposed for the upstream path. The tolerance limits for Novel Bedrosian method, are also established for its physical implementation. We further discuss the realistic implementation of various components of the OTONES topology. We also establish the optimal operation regime of the full concurrent topology based on parameters such as input optical power, pilot tone separation and many more. Finally as a key feature of the thesis, we optimize the system level concept of the topology {{with the use of the}} proposed Novel Bedrosian Method as the optimal analog circuitry for OTONES topology and provide a region of optimal operation of the topology...|$|E
