The influences of DC current on coating morphology, deposition rate, composition, giant magneto-impedance (GMI) effect and magnetic properties were investigated.

40|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to improve the {{performance}} of dye-sensitized solar cells by forming metal-oxide nanocoating layers on ZnO electrodes by a sol-gel transformation. SiO 2, Nb 2 O 5, TiO 2, or ZrO 2 nanocoating layers could be formed by dipping ZnO films into metal alkoxide solutions of low concentrations and subsequent heat treatments. The performance of DSSCs using the coated ZnO electrodes depends strongly on the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>coating</b> layers such as the thickness and the surface coverage, which are significantly influenced by the coating conditions.

For determining of corrosive resistance of coatings 1 M solution of NaCl, potentiodynamic tests and accelerated salt spray test were used. Experiment confirmed that using of Boron Nitride protective coating clearly improves corrosive resistance of the coating on the basis of WC-Co even in hard combined tribocorrosive conditions. Protective layer seals the pores in the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>coating</b> and thus prevents the formation of corrosion and subsequent depreciation of coating in various corrosive environments.

40|$|To {{effectively}} {{improve the}} affinity of polyethylene (PE) separators with liquid electrolyte without causing a serious pore blockage {{and to develop}} a more suitable technology for the industrial production process, porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) layer-coated PE separators are prepared by the dip-coating method followed by a dry-cast process. Different from previous investigations, a less volatile solvent and a relatively volatile nonsolvent are used to yield a preferable pore structure. A brief introduction on the pore formation mechanism during the dry-cast process is provided. The pore <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>coating</b> layer is found to be successfully controlled by changing evaporation temperature, nonsolvent content, and PVDF concentration. The porous PVDF coating layer-modified separators show better affinity with liquid electrolyte and thermal stability. Especially, the ionic conductivity of the modified separator/liquid electrolyte system with a suitable porous coating layer on the separator could reach two times as that of PE separator/liquid electrolyte system, and the cell assembled with modified PE separator shows better cycle performances.

40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{purified}} coated vesicles from rat liver by differential ultracentrifugation.

SDS PAGE <b>of</b> the <b>coated</b> vesicle preparation followed by Coomassie Blue staining of proteins reveals a protein composition also typical <b>of</b> <b>coated</b> vesicles. We determined that these rat liver coated vesicles possess a latent insulin binding capability. That is, {{little if any}} specific binding of 12 ~l-insulin to coated vesicles is observed in the absence <b>of</b> detergent.

40|$|The {{lubrication}} of {{molybdenum disulfide}} coatings has commonly been {{limited by the}} application environments, for instance, the crystal MoS 2 are easily affected by water to form MoO 3 that causes a higher friction coefficient and short lifetime. Therefore, to improve the tribolgical performance of MoS 2 in high humidity condition, the co-doped Pb-Ti/MoS 2 composite coatings are deposited by unbalanced magnetron sputtering system. The design of the co-doping elements in MoS 2 -based coatings can not only maintain the characteristic of low humidity-sensitivity as the Ti/MoS 2 coating but also improve the mechanical properties and tribological performance of coatings as a comparison with single-doped ones. Moreover, the ultra-low friction coefficient with a minimum value of 0. 006 under the vacuum condition is achieved for Pb-Ti/MoS 2 composite coating containing about 4. 6 at. % Pb, depending on the densification <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>coating.</b> Intriguingly, the wear behaviours of Pb-Ti/MoS 2 composite coatings are {{in accordance with the}} variation in H/E (hardness to the elastic modulus) ratio that the coating with higher H/E exhibits lower wear rate. These results demonstrate that the lubricating properties of MoS 2 coatings in both humid environment and vacuum condition can be achieved through the Pb and Ti co-doped, which is of great significant for developing MoS 2 coatings as the environmentally adaptive lubricants.

40|$|For {{understanding}} {{the effect of}} powder feeding fluctuation on coating structure, in-flight particles were investigated by means of image analyzing. Particle behavior was estimated through numerical calculation {{on the base of}} force equilibrium. High definition videos were captured focusing on the in-flight particle stream and transparent carrier tube. Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) coating was prepared with vacuum plasma spraying for clarifying the effect of powder feeding instability on coating structure. Optic micro-morphology of coating was obtained for porosity ratio estimation. An imaginary ring of bent tube was proposed for understanding particle behavior when unavoidable bends exist. Results indicate that periodic fluctuations exist in in-flight particle trajectory and in powder feeding. A transition region was found for particles with different diameters in regions between 0 ° and 180 ° within which particles with large sizes are difficult to transport. As a consequence, accumulation of powder was thus found both on upslope and downslope. The effective cross-section of the carrier tube for powder carrying was found reduced. According to the calculation, reducing equivalent diameter and increasing carrier gas flowrate have the same effect on powder carrying. A threshold was proposed to understand the slug behavior as: growing, maturity and breaking. Due to the break of slug, ‘powder flooding’ happens and may cause mutation in in-flight particle stream. Obvious increase was found in injected particle quality to induce the threelayer <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>coating.</b> An empirical equation was proposed to describe slug behavior as a synthesis of growth rate and loss rate...|$|E

However, its fresh keeping and antimicrobial mechanism is still not very clear. The preservation mechanism of chitosan coating with cinnamon oil for fruits storage is investigated in this paper. Results in the atomic force microscopy sensor images show that many micropores exist in the chitosan coating film. The roughness of coating film {{is affected by the}} concentration of chitosan. The antifungal activity of cinnamon oil should be mainly due to its main consistent trans-cinnamaldehyde, which is proportional to the trans-cinnamaldehyde concentration and improves with increasing the attachment time of oil. The exosmosis ratios of Penicillium citrinum and Aspergillus flavus could be enhanced by increasing the concentration of cinnamon oil. Morphological observation indicates that, compared to the normal cell, the wizened mycelium of A. flavus is observed around the inhibition zone, and the growth of spores is also inhibited. Moreover, the analysis of gas sensors indicate that the chitosan-oil coating could decrease the level of O 2 and increase the level of CO 2 in the package of cherry fruits, which also control the fruit decay. These results indicate that its preservation mechanism might be partly due to the micropores <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>coating</b> film as a barrier for gas and a carrier for oil, and partly due to the activity of cinnamon oil on the cell disruption...|$|E

40|$|All coated {{particle}} producers, when applying the coating layer(s) {{would like to}} know precisely what is the best coating system to use in order to answer customer’s requests. It is, therefore, of very high relevance for many industries, to have a clear understanding of what are the parameters I need to trigger in order to generate the requested quality. Such understanding was the target of this work. The specific equipments designed at Delft University of Technology enabled us to measure the resistance to attrition and the resistance to abrasion of both reference coating agents and commercially pre-mixed coating systems. The resistance to attrition was directly related to the intrinsic properties of the coating material, to the process parameters used to apply the coating layer (fluid bed coating in this case) and to the conditions in which the particles are stored. The viscoelastic properties of the coating layers were measured by using nano indentation. Very good correlation between the viscoelasticity term, tan ?, and the resistance to attrition was found. Cast and sprayed films were produced as representation of the coating film. The morphology and the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>coating</b> layers were mimicked much better by sprayed films which could be obtained by novel equipment designed during this work. To assess the quality of the coating layer and determine how efficient the coating process was, X-Ray micro tomography in combination with image analysis was used. This gave us a very robust set of data which could be used to correlate the quality of the coating layer to the parameters chosen during coating process and those two with the final performance of the {{coated particle}}s in respect of resistance to attrition/abrasion. Finally commercially available pre-mixed coating systems were used as case study.

Nowadays, the recent thread of oil price increase has lead government to create the new ideas for polyol production instead of using petroleum. Palm oil (PO) based polyol is an alternative material that may possibly replace petrochemical-based polyol for polyurethane coating material. Polyurethane was synthesized by reacting palm oil-based polyol with isocyanate. The parameters that have been focused throughout this experiment were mol ratio of palm difference weight ratio of hydrogen peroxide for crude palm oil (CPO) to Acetic Acid to H 2 O 2 during epoxidation process, reaction time in opening ring and the ratio polyol to isocyante for coating process. The experiment works has been done at UMP’s basic engineering laboratory. In this study, PO was first epoxidized to form epoxidation of palm oil (EPO). The process {{has been carried out}} with 4 samples at difference weight ratio of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) for CPO to Acetic Acid to H 2 O 2 which are 1 : 5 : 1, 1 : 5 : 2, 1 : 5 : 4 and 1 : 5 : 6. The presence of oxirane ring of EPO was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and the iodine value of EPO was characterized by Potentiometric Titrator. Then, EPO was converted to palm oil-based polyol by the opening ring reaction with ethyl glycol. The process was carried with difference set of reaction time which is 20 minutes, 40 minutes and 60 minutes respectively. The present of hydroxyl group in polyol was characterized by FTIR and acid value was determined by using Potentiometric Titrator. Palm oil-based polyol was mixed with isocyanate to produce polyurethane coating at different ratio polyol to isocyante were 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is used in order to analyze the surface <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>coating</b> that form. The results shown that lower iodine value (0. 85 I 2 g/ 100 g) was obtained by using mol ratio of 1 : 5 : 4.
