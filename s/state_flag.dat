5|$|The <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> of Washington {{consists}} of the state seal, displaying an image of state namesake George Washington, on a field of dark green with gold fringe being optional. It is the only U.S. <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> with a field of green {{as well as the}} only <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> with the image of an American president. The Secretary of State regulates flag protocol related to the <b>state</b> <b>flag,</b> as well approving replica flags for commercial sale and other standards related to the flag.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, {{representative}} William J. Hughes of Whatcom County {{proposed the}} formation of a commission to adopt the <b>state</b> <b>flag,</b> consisting of the Governor, Secretary of State, and Adjutant General. Governor Ernest Lister became a supporter of the idea, issuing a call for designs from the state's citizens and city organizations. The campaign for a <b>state</b> <b>flag,</b> however, was opposed by patriotic groups like the Sons of the American Revolution and Sons of Veterans, finding the use of a <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> to be detrimental to the national flag.|$|E
5|$|The West Virginia Legislature {{has passed}} a series of laws in the West Virginia Code {{governing}} the usage of the West Virginia <b>state</b> <b>flag.</b> The <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> is not permitted to be placed above, or if on the same level, {{to the right of}} the United States flag. Both the United States and West Virginia state flags are to be flown over the West Virginia State Capitol building year-round. Any United States or West Virginia <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> purchased with state funds must be manufactured in the United States; and West Virginia county boards of education must only purchase state flags manufactured in the United States if board building funds are used. To honor the death of law-enforcement officers within the state, the West Virginia Code permits the draping of the <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> over the coffin at no cost, upon the request of the next-of-kin.|$|E

5|$|During the 1925–26 session, {{the state}} {{legislature}} approved a change to the <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> that replaced the green fringe with a gold to match the state seal. The gold-fringed flag made its official debut on June 27, 1927, flying on the official automobile of the governor during a tour of Fort Lewis. In 1929, the DAR presented a <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> to Governor Hartley, who received it {{on behalf of the}} state for display in the Washington State Capitol.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association {{surveyed}} {{its members}} and other flag enthusiasts on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags. Members ranked the West Virginia <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> at 51 out of the 72 flags surveyed. U.S. state flags with state seals on solid-color fields, like the West Virginia <b>state</b> <b>flag,</b> proved unpopular in the survey.|$|E
5|$|Passed on June 26, 1991, the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the Lithuanian <b>State</b> <b>Flag</b> (Law No. I-1497) {{governs the}} design, sizes {{and use of}} the <b>state</b> <b>flag.</b> The law was amended on July 8, 2004, (Law No. IX-2331) with the most notable changes {{including}} the switching of the national flag ratio from 1:2 to 3:5 and the official adoption of a historical flag as the state (government) flag. The amendment came into force on September 1, 2004, after it was approved by President Valdas Adamkus.|$|E

50|$|Modern U.S. <b>state</b> <b>flags</b> {{date from}} the 1890s, when states wanted to have {{distinctive}} symbols at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Most U.S. <b>state</b> <b>flags</b> were designed and adopted between 1893 and World War I.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{distinguish}} it from the many other blue U.S. <b>state</b> <b>flags,</b> Wisconsin's flag was modified in 1979 to add [...] "Wisconsin" [...] and [...] "1848", the year Wisconsin {{was admitted to the}} Union. All Wisconsin <b>state</b> <b>flags</b> manufactured after May 1, 1981 were required to use this design.|$|R
5|$|The Secretary of State regulates flag {{protocol}} {{as well as}} {{the distribution}} and sale of the <b>state</b> <b>flag.</b> Replica flags made for commercial sale are required to be approved by the Secretary of State. The state seal on the flag must be stitched on both sides with the profile of George Washington facing the same direction, making the Washington <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> among the most expensive U.S. state flags to manufacture.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Secretary of State issued {{standardized}} {{colors for}} the <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> in 1955, including the modern colors {{used in the}} state seal. The state seal itself was redesigned by Dick Nelms {{at the request of}} the Secretary of State in 1967, using Gilbert Stuart's famous portrait painting of George Washington. The new state seal was approved by the state legislature in April 1967, placing it on the updated <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> with immediate effect.|$|E
5|$|The state flag's {{proportions}} {{are identical}} {{to those of the}} flag of the United States. When utilized for parade purposes, all but the staff side of the <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> are to be trimmed with gold fringe.

5|$|In 2004, {{along with}} the law authorizing the change of the flag ratio, a <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> was adopted. This flag {{displays}} the national emblem in a banner form. The ratio of the flag {{is the same as}} that of the national flag, i.e. 3:5. The <b>state</b> <b>flag,</b> called the historical national (armorial) flag in law, was proposed by Česlovas Juršėnas, the vice-speaker of the Seimas, and by Edmundas Rimša, the chairman of the Commission of Heraldry. This flag was also proposed at the same time as the grand coat of arms; both were meant to honor the 750th anniversary of the coronation of Mindaugas in 1253. The designer of the State (historic) flag and coat of arms was Arvydas Každailis. Historically, this flag was used during the Battle of Grunwald, and has served as the government flag for Central Lithuania from 1922 until 1939. This was one of the few flags considered to become the national flag during the drive for national independence. Several other countries, including Finland, Spain, Venezuela, Germany and Thailand, have an official national flag for civilian use and a <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> for government use.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of the current <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> of West Virginia, the state had been represented by a number of flags since attaining statehood in 1863, all of which proved impractical. The first West Virginia Legislature commissioned Joseph H. Diss Debar of Doddridge County to design the Great Seal of West Virginia in 1863. On September 26, 1863, the West Virginia Legislature officially adopted the seal designed by Diss Debar, a stylized version of which was also designated the state's coat of arms. Despite {{the adoption}} of an official seal, the state did not decide upon an official <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> until 1905.|$|E

5|$|The {{flag was}} {{designed}} in 1901 by John Eisenmann for the Pan-American Exposition and adopted in 1902. Before that, {{for nearly a}} century after statehood, Ohio did not have a legally-authorized <b>state</b> <b>flag.</b> One unsuccessful proposal called for a design based on the state seal.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, Ohio {{expressed}} interest in adopting a <b>state</b> <b>flag,</b> as several other states had already done. In late 1860, Qtr. Mr. Gen. David L. Wood and Adj. Gen. Henry B. Carrington devised a flag consisting of the state seal upon a white field. They had it flown above the Ohio State Arsenal in Columbus, in hopes that it might someday become the <b>state</b> <b>flag.</b> On January 17, 1861, at a banquet organized by the Columbus Typographical Union Local #5, future U.S. President James A. Garfield gave a speech defending the national flag as the only flag Ohio's soldiers would march to battle under. The generals, in attendance, were moved to set aside their proposal and hoist the Stars and Stripes in its place. Later that year, Wood and Carrington joined fellow Ohioans in battle under the 34-star Union flag, which would serve as the inspiration for a state banner decades later.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association {{surveyed}} {{its members}} and other flag enthusiasts on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags. Members ranked the Washington <b>state</b> <b>flag</b> 47th out of the 72 flags surveyed, with a score of 4.53 points out of 10. Washington's flag was criticized for its complicated seal, use of lettering, and similarities to other U.S. state flags that used seals on solid colors.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1990s, the {{official}} <b>State</b> <b>Flag</b> of Georgia {{had been a}} center of controversy as it incorporated the historic Confederate flag dating to the American Civil War, which among some people is thought to symbolize resistance to cultural changes in the state. After 2001 changes to the flag which removed this, Governor of Georgia Roy Barnes, who had led the flag-redesign effort, was defeated for re-election; many {{thought it was the}} result of the political backlash. The 1956 version with the Confederate States of America battle emblem, known as a St.Andrew's cross, was a continuing topic of debate for southern heritage proponents. Reed served as one of Governor Sonny Perdue's floor leaders in debates that led to the ratification of the current (2003) version of the <b>state</b> <b>flag.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Ohio Burgee is the {{official}} flag of the U.S. state of Ohio. Ohio's swallowtail flag is the only non-rectangular U.S. <b>state</b> <b>flag.</b> Its red, white, and blue elements symbolize the state's natural features and order of admission into the Union. A prominent disc in the flag's triangular canton is suggestive of the state's name.|$|E
