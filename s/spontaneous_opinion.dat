30|$|A {{total of}} forty-eight (48) {{respondents}} were purposively sampled {{to participate in}} the FGD (Additional files 1 and 2). Sampling of participants was carried out with the assistance of field monitors working for the Department of Arid Lands in Tharaka sub-county. Selection of FGD participants was based on field monitors’ knowledge of their socio-economic well-being (age, education, gender, and income) and participation in social programmes in the community. Open-ended questions were used to seek information from FGD participants (Additional file 3). According to Becken et al. (2013) open-ended questions facilitate <b>spontaneous</b> <b>opinions</b> and avoid restrictions—an attribute critical for this study. The discussions were facilitated in Swahili—a national language widely spoken in Kenya. Where necessary, field monitors (themselves of a Tharaka tribe) would translate questions. This was however not common as most respondents could express themselves in Swahili. In conducting FGDs, reference was made to a twenty-year period (climate change). Thus although respondents’ age ranged from 18  years and above, the specific question of ‘has climate changed in your locality in the past 20  years?’ was mainly directed to participants aged 36  years and above. The purpose of FGD was to generate qualitative data to provide information on community understanding of climate change and variability.|$|R

In tourism, the quality of services in a destination {{is directly related to the}} connections between resources and local actors. Understanding these connections can provide important information for development of mechanisms aimed at qualifying the local tourism offer. This study aims to characterize the strategic network of tourism in Ouro Preto, see which tourist services most used by tourists and identify the main sources of information used by tourists during the travel arrangements. It is a descriptive quantitative study. During the stage of data collection were applied 600 questionnaires, targeting the tourist, selected through non-probability sampling technique at random.

In our <b>opinion,</b> <b>spontaneous</b> rupture of the oesophagus, instrumental perforation, open and closed traumatic lesions, and postoperative anastomotic leaks are, as far as diagnosis and management are concerned, different aspects of the same desperate surgical problem. Oesophageal trauma is accompanied by a high morbidity and mortality rate if diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Perforations of the cervical oesophagus may be treated conservatively.

40|$|Background. Domestic {{accidents}} involving falls, {{as a common}} episode in the elderly households, can reach the point of physical incapacitation, with consequent loss of independence at old age. Research has pointed out schemes for accident avoidance, including rearranging home spaces and furniture in safer ways. Based on observation and generalization, treatment often deal with old people as if forming a homogeneous group, thus establishing a single pattern of intervention upon the elders` home wandering habits, and life style, {{with little or no}} regard, to individual differences. To effectively protect the aging person, such practical aid should adapt to each case, beginning by knowing what he/she thinks and says about his/her aging condition. Object: to establish which perceptions and behavioral categories were employed by elders when describing their own physical ability and intellectual condition as related to a past episode of fall. Method: a qualitative research was done, consisting of semi-structured interviews about motives given by aging individuals, their reasons, their <b>spontaneous</b> <b>opinions</b> about both their health condition, and causes of falls in the home. Results: 15 subjects (11 men, 4 women, mean age= 74. 8) were interviewed at home, of a lower medium class neighborhood of Sao Paulo, all under medical attention of a geriatric program, (epidoso) by Unifesp`s Department of Preventive Medicine. Data was transcribed and grouped into cultural concepts and categories, revealing modes of thinking, thus condensed: a) subjects blame falls at home to “distraction”, “lack of attention” and “fail”, that is, for them the fall is due to a momentary absence of awareness, but in-depth analysis reveals underlying lack of perception of obstacles` true place in the room, that end up in stumbling and fall. This is aggravated by the supposed familiarity with a notion of the labyrinth of home, its paths being no longer true, following itineraries no longer precise. In other words, judgment becomes definitely impaired, and yet continues to orient actions, which are now wrong; b) objectivity, in self-evaluation, can be disfigured by a warped interpretation of reality, due to magical or pseudo-scientific beliefs, that commonly carry a serious outcome, the non-compliance with existing medical programs. Conclusion. Programs vowed to raise the aging people`s awareness of dangers of falling in the home should consider close inclusion of cultural traits of subjects as well as an appraisal of the state of self awareness. In addition, individual diversity, behavioral and social, should be taken into account when the issue is preventive counseling. O aumento da população de idosos no mundo direciona pesquisas a buscar maneiras de controle das enfermidades crônicas decorrentes do envelhecimento. A queda é um dos agravos que fragiliza e impede a manutenção da capacidade funcional do idoso. Objetivo: Compreender a representatividade social da queda para o idoso que a sofreu e, através da analise do cotidiano das tarefas domésticas, definir quais foram as atitudes tomadas diante do evento. Método: Análise qualitativa, utilizando entrevista semi-estruturada, partindo do tema da influência da queda na vida diária. As falas são transcritas codificadas e posteriormente categorizadas expressando as idéias encontradas no pensamento do idoso. Resultados: Identificou-se que para o idoso que sofre queda, esta passa a ser fator de preocupação e cuidados quando interfere na autonomia para os afazeres do cotidiano. A queda trouxe ao indivíduo distintas percepções segundo o impacto físico provocado. Para aqueles que tiveram a rotina alterada pela incapacidade de realizar tarefas, a queda retomou a percepção do envelhecimento decadente. Aos que mantiveram as atividades rotineiras, a queda reafirmou a percepção de autonomia nesses indivíduos ao sentirem-se livres das decadências provenientes da idade. Conclusão: Para incentivar a conscientização dos riscos de queda em idosos, profissionais de saúde devem mostrar que a queda interfere nas atividades rotineiras destes indivíduos e, portanto, além de promover incapacidades físicas, o evento impede a continuidade de tarefas tão valorizadas no cotidiano de idosos. Estas tarefas não devem ser restringidas, mas readaptadas. TED...|$|R
40|$|Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We {{aimed at}} {{providing}} {{the most recent}} and relevant evidence regarding spontaneous breathing activity during mechanical ventilation in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Both clinical and experimental data are depicted. RECENT FINDINGS: The use of unsupported spontaneous breathing {{has been associated with}} the most beneficial effects reported to date, but recent data favors also pressure-supported breathing activity in experimental ALI. In patients with ALI/ARDS, unsupported spontaneous breathing in combination with mandatory cycles has been shown to improve lung function, reduce the need for sedation and cardiocirculatory drug therapy, and speed weaning, with no effect on mortality. On the other hand, strong clinical evidence shows that the use of neuromuscular blocking agents in the first 48  h of mechanical ventilation with the volume assist-control ventilation mode reduces morbidity and mortality in severe ARDS compared to placebo. SUMMARY: In our <b>opinion,</b> <b>spontaneous</b> breathing activity should be avoided in the first 48  h of mechanical ventilation in patients with severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FIO 2 < 120  mmHg), but it may be useful in less severe ARDS and ALI. Clearly, further clinical and experimental investigations on the use of different ventilation modes of supported/unsupported spontaneous breathing in ALI/ARDS are needed...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of heptyl aldehyde, through the diet, into tumor-bearing mice has a pronounced {{effect on the}} liquefaction and ultimate fate of spontaneous tumors of the mammary gland. 4 Similar changes have been produced in spontaneous tumors in mice by the injection of heptyl aldehyde into the individual at sites remote from the tumor. Due, however, to local ulceration {{at the site of}} injection, produced by the undiluted heptyl aldehyde, subsequent treatment of tumors in mice by this technic is restricted. It has also been determined that retrogressive changes in spontaneous tumors in dogs could be brought about by the injection of the same material. Due, perhaps, to the more resistant nature of the dog's skin, this local ulceration is minimized and, in fact, by careful technic is completely eliminated. 7 It is reasonable to believe that it is perhaps more significant to influence cancer by introducing certain pure chemicals into the organism through the diet than by the injection of the same material. Extensive investigations, however, have shown that relatively larger quantities of materials are necessary to produce a given physiological effect when given per os than by injection. Cancer is still an unknown quantity; in fact, it defies classification. Consequently, in order to demonstrate a clear-cut effect on the origin and fate of neoplastic tissue, one must be careful not to handle the experimental animal too much, as may possibly be done by periodic injections. It has also been shown that redistilled chemically pure heptyl aldehyde is probably the active ingredient in the low boiling-point fraction of the true oil of Gaultheria which brings about the liquefaction of <b>spontaneous</b> tumors. The <b>opinion</b> is also valid 5 that th...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores Lefebvre’s {{method of}} rhythmanalysis (2002) {{and the way}} lived {{experiences}} are documented in content circulated in smart devices and uploaded on social media. As per the model set by Vertov’s film, can this kind of content be used as observational tools for the rhythmanalysist? Today, the merger of physical space with the digital world of information creates a new urban environment that is techno-synthetically composed. As the rhythms of the city change and are intertwined with instantaneous communication technologies, Lefebvre’s method in observing social space -via the study of rhythms becomes even more prominent (see also Stanek 2011, Apperley 2010). Content {{in the form of}} pictures, video and status updates sent and received by smart devices and circulated in social media, depicts scenes from everyday life. Projects such as Rhythm of Capitalism (rhythmofcapitalism. wordpress. com) make explicit references to Lefebvre’s idea of Rhythmanalysis, as they depict short videos clips from everyday life. Inspired by this, the paper will look at specific case studies such as the London riots of 2011, popular Instagram hash tags such as ‘photooftheday’, the Beat project (Social Media Information Lab sm. rutgers. edu/thebeat/) that combines geo-locaiton data with Google maps and images shared on social media sites. In Rhythmanalysis Lefebvre examines the level of human and bodily everyday experience and the rhythms of everyday life in order to articulate what constitutes a lived experience. Lefebvre situates rhythm inside the lived experience; “rhythm enters into the lived” (2004 [1992]: 77). The Rhythmanalysist “thinks with his body, not in abstract, but in lived temporality” (Lefebvre 2004 [1992]: 21). A rhythm can contain all proportional aspects of the self, space, time, and equally include psychological, social and organic aspects – it can be though as a unit of diverse relations (Lefebvre 2004 [1992]: 77). Applying the method of rhythmanalysis, {{it can be said that}} the lived experience is documented in content, circulated in smart devices and uploaded on social media. There is an ephemeral quality to the content uploaded on social media sites. This kind of daily documentation of everyday activities is a new cultural trend. Extracting a level of performativity this kind of snap shooting of everyday life contributes a character of immediacy and nowness; everything is shared ‘in the moment’. Content coming out of the portable data processor that is circulated to global and peer networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, comes from the level of the street, everyday life and experiences. Vertov’s film The Man with The movie Camera, is made up of short visual clips that depict various scenes from everyday life in three cities. Because of Vertov’s ideological layering of the film’s plot in three levels of view points, it has been used as a metaphor by Manovich (2002) and Deleuze (1983) in order to express that the juxtaposition of images using pioneering editing techniques creates the ideological basis of expression in Vertov. As per the model set by Vertov’s film, in which scenes from everyday life are depicted, content in the form of pictures, videos and status updates uploaded on social media, sent and received by smart devices depict fragments of everyday life. During and immediately after the London riots in August 2011, an array of video clips circulated on youtube and Facebook depict people from all walks of life, at the riots’ locations, engaged in <b>spontaneous</b> discussion, sharing <b>opinions</b> about the cause of the riots. The Rhythms of Capitalism website contains short video clips that depict scenes of everyday life, video clips range from a video depicting an espresso machine making coffee, to sea waves to people walking on the street. These short video clips could be used as observational tools for the rhythmanalysist. Although Lefebvre asserts that “No camera, no image or series of images can show these rhythms. It requires equally attentive eyes and ears, a head and a memory and a heart” (Lefebvre 1974), the street-level quality of these depictions offer a street-level viewpoint that Lefebvre would encourage as voices coming from the observational level of rhythmanalysis. Observing this kinds of content as tools for the rhythmanalysist, it can be said that they depict rhythms of everyday life, they produce rhythms, they open dialogues for the creation of rhythms. This paper will explore the relationship between the method of Rhythmanalysis and lived experience as documented in content circulated in smart devices and uploaded in social media sites...|$|R
