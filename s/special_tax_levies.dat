The ruling effectively removed the only tool the city had for enforcing payment of the special assessments by homeowners. Road construction contractors stopped all work because they feared the city would not pay them. Many homeowners stopped paying their assessment bills.|$|E

50|$|Jewish Disabilities {{were legal}} {{restrictions}} and limitations placed on Jews in the Middle Ages. They included provisions requiring Jews to wear specific and identifying clothing {{such as the}} Jewish hat and the yellow badge, restricting Jews to certain cities and towns or {{in certain parts of}} towns (ghettos), and forbidding Jews to enter certain trades (for example selling new clothes in medieval Sweden). Disabilities also included <b>special</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>levied</b> on Jews, exclusion from public life, restraints on the performance of religious ceremonies, and linguistic censorship.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} Jews in Merkinė is dated 1539, when a dispute was adjudicated (July 8) between a Jew named Konyuk and a Christian {{in regard to}} a debt of the former. In 1551 the Jews of Merkinė were named among those of fourteen other towns to be exempted from the <b>special</b> <b>tax</b> <b>levied</b> upon all inhabitants, {{with the exception of}} villagers and Jews, at the Lithuanian diet (Seimas) held in that year on November 27 at Vilnius.

On 20 February 1229, therefore, Yaroslav Vsevolodovich’s sons (Fedor Yaroslavich and Aleksandr Yaroslavich) fled to their father. The Novgorodians got word to Mikhail, and he set out for Novgorod upon receiving the invitation; he arrived in Novgorod around the beginning of May.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "act {{to provide}} for the {{erection}} of a State Capitol" [...] was passed by the Nevada Legislature and signed into law by Governor Henry G. Blasdel during 1869. The Board of Capitol Commissioners received bids of $84,000 to $160,000 for construction and they chose the lowest bid, submitted by Peter Cavanaugh and Son of Carson City. The 1869 act authorized $100,000 for construction, with money to come from a <b>special</b> <b>tax</b> <b>levy,</b> plus the proceeds from the sale of some public land. To reduce costs, the building sandstone was obtained free of charge from the Nevada State Prison quarry, just outside Carson City. In spite of this, the construction costs increased to some $170,000, exceeding even the high bid.|$|R

At that time, the citizens of Henderson County approved a bond issue and a <b>special</b> <b>tax</b> <b>levy</b> which provided funds for the construction, operation, and maintenance of a physical plant for the school. The institution began operation on December 1, 1969, with the first course offered on January 8, 1970. The first full-time curriculum began on September 14, 1970. On October 12, 1970, the school's board of trustees voted to change the school's name to Blue Ridge Technical Institute.

50|$|A tampon tax {{refers to}} a {{condition}} in sales tax law under which tampons—and other feminine hygiene products used to absorb menstrual flow—are not tax exempt like some other medical necessities. Proponents argue that tampons, sanitary napkins, and comparable products form basic, unavoidable necessities for women and thus should be made tax exempt. The tax in Canada was removed in mid-2015 and women protested in the United Kingdom later that year. Other countries later followed suit.The BBC estimates that women—half of the global population—need to use tampons or other feminine hygiene products to absorb menstrual flow for about a week each month for about 30 years. While sales tax policy varies across jurisdictions, these products were typically taxed {{at the same rate as}} non-essential goods, such as in the United States, while other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, reduced or eliminated their general consumption tax on sanitary products. The tampon tax is not a <b>special</b> <b>tax</b> <b>levied</b> directly on feminine hygiene products.|$|R

In spite of the general discontent, the brothers were initially unable to stir up a rebellion, because their compatriots did not believe that they had any chance against the imperial troops. Theodor and Asen took advantage of the sack of Thessaloniki by the Normans, during which icons of Demetrius of Thessaloniki, the patron saint of the town, were taken to Bulgaria. They built a [...] "house of prayer" [...] and summoned Bulgarian and Vlach shamans to the site.

Thomas Crawford of Jordanhill led the attack to regain control of the castle, while Drumquhassle supported with his men. Drumquhassle was made Captain of Dumbarton Castle after its surrender, and he appears to have later held this post concurrently with Master of the Royal Household, for which he is recorded as having received payments from the Treasurer of Scotland. Along with Matthew Douglas of Mains, all were discharged of any crimes committed during the action by an act of parliament.|$|R

Furthermore, the housecarles were not bound to indefinite service; but there was only one day in the year during which they could leave the king's service. That was New Year's Eve, a day on which it was customary for Scandinavian kings to reward their retainers with gifts.|$|R
