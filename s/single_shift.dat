5|$|The Bill {{is unique}} amongst police dramas {{in that it}} takes a serial format, {{focussing}} on the work and lives of a <b>single</b> <b>shift</b> of police officers, rather than on one particular area of police work. Also unique is that The Bill adapted to this format after several series, whereas comparable series started with the serial format.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of 3 chainrings and an 8-sprocket cogset does {{not result in}} 24 usable gear ratios. Instead it provides 3 overlapping ranges of 7, 8, and 7 gear ratios. The outer ranges only have 7 ratios rather than 8 because the extreme combinations (largest chainring to largest rear sprocket, smallest chainring to smallest rear sprocket) result in a very diagonal chain alignment which is inefficient and causes excessive chain wear. Due to the overlap, there will usually be some duplicates or near-duplicates, so that there might only be 16 or 18 distinct gear ratios. It may not be feasible to use these distinct ratios in strict low-high sequence anyway due to the complicated shifting patterns involved (e.g. simultaneous double or triple shift on the rear derailleur and a <b>single</b> <b>shift</b> on the front derailleur). In the worst case there could be only 10 distinct gear ratios, if the percentage step between chainrings {{is the same as}} the percentage step between sprockets. However, if the most popular ratio is duplicated then it may be feasible to extend the life of the gear set by using different versions of this popular ratio.|$|E

2500|$|The prefix [...] "Temporary" [...] {{before a}} rank (e.g. Temporary Detective Sergeant, {{abbreviated}} T/DS) denotes an officer {{who has been}} temporarily promoted to a rank (and so who does actually hold that rank, albeit on a temporary basis), whilst the prefix [...] "Acting" [...] (e.g. Acting Inspector, abbreviated A/Insp) denotes an officer who is performing {{the role of a}} higher rank than the one actually held (sometimes informally termed [...] "acting up"). Temporary ranks are often used for set periods (e.g. a six-month appointment to a particular role), whereas acting ranks, although sometimes held for extended periods, are often used for a very short time (e.g. a <b>single</b> <b>shift</b> when additional supervisory officers are required, or to replace an officer on short-term leave).|$|E
2500|$|The {{high level}} of {{production}} proved to be unsustainable. Development work of new reserves could not {{keep pace with the}} production of 6,000 tons of crude ore per month. In January 1943 production had to be scaled down, and the ore dressing mill reduced to a <b>single</b> <b>shift</b> per day. But a bigger blow was to follow. In May 1943, as one of the shafts was being deepened, the miners encountered bands of soft, black shale. The Ministry sent in a team of Canadian Engineers with diamond drilling equipment, and this confirmed that the Skiddaw Group of rocks lay at about [...] below the main entrance to the mine (The Lucy Level), not at [...] as the geologists had predicted. The rich bonanza of ore the company had expected was not there.|$|E

40|$|Piezoelectricity {{appears in}} the {{inversion}} asymmetric crystal that converts mechanical deformational force to electricity. Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcolgenide (TMDC) monolayers exhibit the piezoelectric effect due to the inversion asymmetry. The intrinsic piezoelectric coefficient (e 11) of MoS 2 is ~ 298 pC/m. For the <b>single</b> atomic <b>shift</b> of Mo of 20 % along the armchair direction, the piezoelectric coefficient (e 11) of MoS 2 with 5 x 5 unit cells was enhanced up to 18 %, and significantly modified the band structure. The <b>single</b> atomic <b>shift</b> in the MoS 2 monolayer also induced new energy levels inside the forbidden bandgap. The defect-induced energy levels for a Mo atom shift along the armchair direction are relatively deeper than the energy levels for a S atom shift along the same direction.
