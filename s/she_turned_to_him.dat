He {{uses her}} love for him to teach her violin techniques. However, after the fire accident, he disappeared from Hane's life.

500|$|Family friend John T. Ford opened 1,500-seat Ford's Theatre on November 9 in Washington, D.C. Booth {{was one of}} {{the first}} leading men to appear there, playing in Charles Selby's The Marble Heart. In this play, Booth portrayed a Greek {{sculptor}} in costume, making marble statues come to life. Lincoln watched the play from his box. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln's sister-in-law was sitting with him in the same presidential box where he was later slain; <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and said, [...] "Mr. Lincoln, he looks as if he meant that for you." [...] The President replied, [...] "He does look pretty sharp at me, doesn't he?" [...] On another occasion, Lincoln's son Tad saw Booth perform. He said that the actor thrilled him, prompting Booth to give Tad a rose. Booth ignored an invitation to visit Lincoln between acts.|$|E

6000|$|KATHERINE. [Very low] Thank you! [Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> {{and draws}} {{his eyes on}} her. Without a sound, she puts her whole {{strength}} into that look] Stephen! Give it up! Come down to me! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you hear, Mr. Greene?" [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "Do {{you mean}} to allow that vast amount of {{property}} to be lost without an effort? Are you prepared to replace my jewels?" ...|$|R

60|$|His head fell over, and Harold, laying {{him gently}} down, knelt beside Stephen. He {{put his arm}} round her; and <b>she,</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> laid {{her hand on his}} breast and sobbed as though her heart would break.|$|R

6000|$|EILEEN (with {{an attempt}} at a {{careless}} tone). Nothing. If you can't see---- (<b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> with sudden intensity.)
