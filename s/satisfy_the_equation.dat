25|$|In pure mathematics, {{differential}} equations are studied from several different perspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions—the {{set of functions}} that <b>satisfy</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation.</b> Only the simplest {{differential equations}} are solvable by explicit formulas; however, some properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without finding their exact form.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{reasoning}} breaks down for four keys {{because there are}} sets of keys w, x, y, and z where none of the four has a byte value {{that it does not}} share with {{at least one of the}} other keys. For instance, if the keys have two bytes each, and w, x, y, and z are the four keys that have either zero or one as their byte values, then each byte value in each position is shared by exactly two of the four keys. For these four keys, the hash values computed by tabulation hashing will always <b>satisfy</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> , whereas for a 4-independent hashing scheme the same equation would only be satisfied with probability 1/m. Therefore, tabulation hashing is not 4-independent.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the orbit}} in Figure3 {{may seem to}} rotate uniformly, i.e., at a {{constant}} angular speed, this is true only for circular orbits.

2500|$|The {{invention}} of Cartesian coordinates in the 17th century by René Descartes (Latinized name: Cartesius) revolutionized mathematics {{by providing the}} first systematic link between Euclidean geometry and algebra. Using the Cartesian coordinate system, geometric shapes (such as curves) can be described by Cartesian equations: algebraic equations involving the coordinates of the points lying on the shape.

2500|$|The {{situation}} can be profitably {{compared to that}} which arises {{in the search for}} functions on the projective space P(V): in that setting, one would ideally like functions F on the vector space V which are polynomial in the coordinates of v≠0 in V and <b>satisfy</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> F(cv)=F(v) for all non-zero c. Unfortunately, the only such functions are constants. If we allow denominators (rational functions instead of polynomials), we can let F be the ratio of two homogeneous polynomials of the same degree. Alternatively, we can stick with polynomials and loosen the dependence on c, letting F(cv)=c'k'F(v). The solutions are then the homogeneous polynomials of degree [...] On the one hand, these form a finite dimensional vector space for eachk, and on the other, if we let k vary, we can find the numerators and denominators for constructing all the rational functions which are really functions on the underlying projective spaceP(V).|$|E
