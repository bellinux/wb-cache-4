Level IIIA (high speed 9mm) armor consists 8mm of laminated glass (<b>strike</b> <b>face)</b> a 1mm air gap and 7mm of polycarbonate. This solution stops the bullets in a total different way. The glass being hard deforms the incoming bullet. The deformed bullet completely penetrates the glass and then it is stopped by the flexible polycarbonate. The weight reduction over traditional glass clad polycarbonate is 35% weighing 28 kilos per square meter. It is also thinner (16.2mm). The picture on the right shows how the bullet is embedded between the glass and the polycarbonate.|$|E
5000|$|The Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) and the {{enhanced}} SAPI plate for the US DOD generally has this form. [...] Because {{of the use}} of ceramic plates for rifle protection, these vests are 5-8 times as heavy on an area basis as handgun protection. The weight and stiffness of rifle armor is a major technical challenge. The density, hardness and impact toughness are among the materials properties that are balanced to design these systems. While ceramic materials have some outstanding properties for ballistics they have poor fracture toughness. Failure of ceramic plates by cracking must also be controlled. [...] For this reason many ceramic rifle plates are a composite. The <b>strike</b> <b>face</b> is ceramic with the backface formed of laminated fiber and resin materials. The hardness of the ceramic prevents the penetration of the bullet while the tensile strength of the fiber backing helps prevent tensile failure. Examples of rifle resistant outer vests include the Interceptor body armor and the Improved Outer Tactical Vest.|$|E
5000|$|The Kreyenhagen Hills are a {{range of}} {{foothill}}s of the Diablo Range in western Fresno County and Kings County, California. [...] The Kreyenhagen Hills form a long foothill belt in the soft formations between Reef Ridge and Kettleman Plain. They are divided into several groups, each a few miles wide, by streams crossing them at right angles. They meet with the steep face of Reef Ridge, and are distinct from the mountains which begin there. To the northeast the strata form ridge after ridge, parallel to each other, and extend {{the length of the}} separate divisions between the main stream valleys. These ridges, appear like a series of waves advancing, toward Reef Ridge, and elsewhere to broken waves, as in a choppy sea. The ridges are slightly asymmetric, the northeast flank being a dip slope and fairly smooth, while the southwest flank is a steeper, <b>strike</b> <b>face</b> that is in many places eroded so as to leave sharp gullies and conical intermediate ridges extending outward. The groups of hillocks so produced bear some resemblance to an encampment of tents or huts, and the name Jacalitos, (meaning the little huts), may have been applied to Jacalitos Creek owing to this feature of the hills through which it flows. The greatest symmetry of the parallel ridges appear's in the portion of the Kreyenhagen Hills between Jacalitos Creek and Big Tar Canyon, and there the long, straight, smooth troughs between the ridges doubtless gave rise to the name Canoas, meaning trough, applied to Canoas Creek which passes across the central portion of the hills.

40|$|A {{material}} {{combination that}} may be applied as transparent armour is glass-clad polyurethane. These are comprised of a relatively thin glass <b>strike</b> <b>face</b> and a relatively thick (transparent) polyurethane backing layer. Three transparent polyurethane samples were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The DSC results identified the glass transitions {{and in some cases}} the melting and crystallisation processes. The DMA experiments were only performed on heating around the glass transition region to further investigate this transition. The experiments were performed at three different frequencies (1, 10 and 100 Hz); the shift of the glass transition with the frequency was clearly observed. The method of time-temperature superposition was used to extrapolate the results to higher frequencies as the magnitude of the strain-rate occurring within ballistic applications is in the order of 1000 s- 1 or higher. Polyurethane with a rubbery behaviour at normal (low) strain rates can be stiff and brittle when used as an armour component (temperature below its dynamic T g value). © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{accelerate}} the development of ceramic materials for armour applications, by substantially increasing the information obtained from a high-energy projectile impact event. This has been achieved by modifying an existing test configuration to incorporate a block of ballistic gel, attached to the <b>strike</b> <b>face</b> of a ceramic armour system, to capture fragments generated during the ballistic event such that their final positions are maintained. Three different materials, representative of the major classes of ceramics for armour applications, alumina, silicon carbide and boron carbide, have been tested using this system. Ring-on-ring biaxial disc testing has also been carried out on the same materials. Qualitative analysis of the fracture surfaces using scanning electron microscopy and surface roughness quantification, via stereoimaging, has shown that the fracture surfaces of biaxial fragments and ballistic fragments recovered from the edges of the tile are indistinguishable. Although the alumina and boron carbide fragments generated from areas closer to the point of impact were also similar, the silicon carbide fragments showed an increase in porosity with respect to the fragments from further away and from biaxial testing. This porosity was found to result from the loss of a boron-rich second phase, which was widespread elsewhere in the material, although the relevance of this to ballistic performance needs further investigation. The technique developed in this work will help facilitate such studies...|$|E

Using right-circular cylindrical projectiles, previous experimental results of Cunniff [1] (using a similar fiber, Spectra ® instead of Dyneema®) showed nearly a factor of two difference in the V 50 velocity in the two possible stacking orders, i. e., Spectra ® versus Kevlar 29 ® as the <b>strike</b> <b>face.</b> This new model extends our previous fundamental work [2] by addressing interference factors in terms of instantaneous material inflow to the impact cone using a convolution over current local strain around the projectile edge during its deceleration.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that significant weight reductions can be achieved, compared to conventional glass-based armor, when a transparent ceramic is used as the <b>strike</b> <b>face</b> on a glass-polymer laminate. Magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl 2 O 4) and AlON are promis-ing candidate materials for application as a hard front layer in transparent armor. Com-prehensive, systematic investigations of the fragmentation of ceramics {{have shown that the}} mode of fragmentation {{is one of the key}} parameters influencing the ballistic resistance of ceramics. In the study described here, the fragmentation of AlON and three types of spinel was analyzed: two types of fine grained spinel with nominal average grain sizes 0. 6 lm and 1. 6 lm and a bimodal grain-sized spinel with large grains of 250 lm size in a fine grain (5 – 20 lm) matrix were examined. The ceramic specimens of 6 -mm thickness were glued to an aluminum backing and impacted with armor piercing (AP) projectiles of caliber 7. 62 mm at two different velocities— 850 m/s and 1100 m/s. The targets were integrated into a target box, which allowed for an almost complete recovery and analysis of the ceramic fragments. Different types of high-speed cameras were applied in order to visualize the different phases of fragment formation and ejection. A laser light-sheet illu-mination technique was applied in combination with high-speed cameras in order to determine size and speed of ejected ceramic fragments during projectile penetration. The application of the visualization techniques allowed for the analysis of the dynamics of the fragment formation and interaction with the projectile. A significant difference in the fragment size distributions of bimodal grain-sized spinel and AlON was observed. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4023573...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work was to study the interdependence between hard armour and soft armour systems by fabricating different armour styles and investigating their ballistic performance. A range of armour styles was manufactured &ndash; identified as Basic Armour (BA), Optimum Armour (OP) and Standalone Armour (SA) using different batches of RSSC ceramic tiles with varying thicknesses (4 mm, 6 mm and 8 mm). The ballistic testing was conducted using single shot AK- 47 ammunition, fired {{with a wide range}} of velocities, to understand the interdependence between hard and soft armours. The research work included improving the fabrication techniques used to clad the ceramic tiles for the existing armour systems and examining alternative design methodologies to reduce the Back Face Signature (BFS). One method was to apply tension on the cladding fabric covering the rear face of the ceramic tile. There were several important parameters that were considered, which included reduction in BFS value, weight reduction and enhanced flexibility of manufacture. The research work undertaken in this study comprised of two sections - firstly, mechanical testing, and secondly, ballistic tests. Mechanical testing consisted of investigating the physical characteristics of Kevlar&reg; XP&trade;, a non-crimp fabric from DuPont, by varying its orientation (discussed in detail in Chapter 3). Three series of three ballistic performance tests (Trial # 1, Trial # 2 and Trial # 3) were conducted using Reaction-Sintered Silicon Carbide (RSSC) ceramic tiles of varying thickness as an initial <b>strike</b> <b>face</b> backed by a combination of laminated and/or loose Kevlar&reg; XP&trade; backing materials (discussed in detail in Chapters 4 &mdash; 6). It has been shown that by applying tension (in one direction only) to the Kevlar&reg; cladding fabric across the rear face of the RSSC tiles, a reduction of 2. 9 mm in the BFS values was observed. Evaluation and comparisons were also conducted between clad and unclad armour styles to understand the effects of cladding (more information in Chapters 6 &mdash; 7). However, the results showed that there was little difference in the BFS values observed between the clad and unclad armour styles. The ballistic tests confirmed that clad RSSC tiles do not fully disintegrate on the first impact when compared to unclad RSSC tiles...|$|E
