The results of the CPT indicated that the placement technique is one of the most important factors in controlling the as-placed density of hydraulically placed <b>sand</b> <b>fill.</b> There is a marked contrast in cone tip resistance (and the associated relative density) profiles for the <b>sand</b> <b>fills</b> formed by subaerial and subaqueous placement methods, in which the cone tip resistance of the <b>sand</b> <b>fill</b> formed by subaerial placement is substantially higher than that of the <b>sand</b> <b>fill</b> formed by subaequeous placement. The results confirm that dense <b>sand</b> <b>fill</b> cannot be formed by subaqueous placement methods.

The {{mathematical}} {{models of}} compacting process in green sand molding were built up {{based on the}} experiment results of molding sand property testing, in which the nonlinearity problems involved in the molding sand material, the pattern geometry and the contact between sand and flask were considered.

40|$|Due to {{downhole}} complexities, shale-gas {{horizontal well}} fracturing in the Sichuan Basin suffered from casing deformation {{and failure to}} apply the technique of cable-conveyed perforation bridge plug. In view of these problems, a new technique of staged volume fracturing with temporary plugging by <b>sand</b> <b>filling</b> is employed. Based on theoretical analyses and field tests, a design of optimized parameters of coiled tubing-conveyed multi-cluster sand-blasting perforation and temporary plugging by <b>sand</b> <b>filling</b> was proposed. It was applied in the horizontal Well ZJ- 1 in which casing deformation occurred. The following results are achieved in field operations. First, this technique enables selective staged fracturing in horizontal sections. Second, this technique can realize massive staged fracturing credibly without mechanical plugging, with the operating efficiency equivalent to the conventional bridge plug staged fracturing. Third, full-hole is preserved after fracturing, thus {{it is possible to}} directly conduct an open flow test without time consumption of a wiper trip. The staged volume fracturing with temporary plugging by <b>sand</b> <b>filling</b> facilitated the 14 -stage fracturing in Well ZJ- 1, with similar SRV to that achieved by conventional bridge plug staged fracturing and higher gas yield than neighboring wells on the same well pad. Thus, a new and effective technique is presented in multi-cluster staged volume fracturing of shale gas horizontal wells...|$|E
