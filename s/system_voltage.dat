5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the <b>system</b> <b>voltage</b> during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E
25|$|Electronic voltage {{regulators}} {{are found in}} devices such as computer power supplies where they stabilize the DC voltages used by the processor and other elements. In automobile alternators and central power station generator plants, {{voltage regulators}} control {{the output of the}} plant. In an electric power distribution <b>system,</b> <b>voltage</b> regulators may be installed at a substation or along distribution lines so that all customers receive steady voltage independent of how much power is drawn from the line.|$|E
25|$|The Insight’s IMA {{is powered}} by a flat, nickel metal hydride battery pack located below the cargo floor between the rear wheels. The 84 module battery is {{manufactured}} by Sanyo Electric and provides a nominal <b>system</b> <b>voltage</b> of 100.8 volts with a nominal capacity of 5.75 ampere-hours. The power density of the modules is 30 percent greater than in the second generation Civic Hybrid. The battery is recharged automatically by scavenging engine power, when needed, and by regenerative braking when the car is decelerating. The power management electronics, battery modules, and cooling system are all self-contained within the IMA battery pack.|$|E

25|$|In DC {{circuits}} and pulsed circuits, {{current and}} voltage reversal {{are affected by}} the damping of the <b>system.</b> <b>Voltage</b> reversal is encountered in RLC circuits that are underdamped. The current and voltage reverse direction, forming a harmonic oscillator between the inductance and capacitance. The current and voltage tends to oscillate and may reverse direction several times, with each peak being lower than the previous, until the system reaches an equilibrium. This {{is often referred to as}} ringing. In comparison, critically damped or overdamped systems usually do not experience a voltage reversal. Reversal is also encountered in AC circuits, where the peak current is equal in each direction.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent the}} risk of {{out-of-phase}} supplies mixing, sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated. This is achieved by Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although, typically, only half are in use at any time, the others being provided to allow a feeder station {{to be shut down}} and power provided from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal <b>system</b> <b>voltage</b> if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers {{may not be able to}} safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent {{the risk of}} an arc being drawn across from one section of wire to earth, when passing through the neutral section, the train must be coasting and the circuit breakers must be open. In many cases, this is done manually by the drivers. To help them, a warning board is provided just before both the neutral section and an advance warning some distance before. A further board is then provided after the neutral section to tell drivers to re-close the circuit breaker, although drivers must not do this until the rear pantograph has passed this board. In the UK, a system known as Automatic Power Control (APC) automatically opens and closes the circuit breaker, this being achieved by using sets of permanent magnets alongside the track communicating with a detector on the train. The only action needed by the driver is to shut off power and coast and therefore warning boards are still provided at and on the approach to neutral sections.|$|E
2500|$|DM 48 and {{trailers}} D 113 and D 138 (DM 556, D 2130 and D 2411) was {{the last}} single-headlight set in use in Wellington, hence its nickname [...] "Cyclops", and was withdrawn in 2012. Previously shortened to two cars {{to work on the}} Johnsonville Branch with DM 27, the set was donated to the newly founded Wellington Heritage Multiple Unit Preservation Trust in January 2013 and was moved to the Rimutaka Incline Railway's Maymorn site for storage on 21 April 2013.

2500|$|The I2t {{rating is}} related to the amount of energy let through by the fuse element when it clears the {{electrical}} fault. This term is normally used in short circuit conditions and the values are used to perform co-ordination studies in electrical networks. I2t [...] parameters are provided by charts in manufacturer data sheets for each fuse family. [...] For coordination of fuse operation with upstream or downstream devices, both [...] melting I2t and clearing I2t are specified. The melting I2t is proportional to the amount of energy required to begin melting the fuse element. The clearing I2t is proportional to the total energy let through by the fuse when clearing a fault. The energy is mainly dependent on current and time for fuses as well as the available fault level and <b>system</b> <b>voltage.</b> Since the I2t rating of the fuse is proportional to the energy it lets through, it {{is a measure of the}} thermal damage from the heat and magnetic forces that will be produced by a fault.|$|E

40|$|In {{alternating}} current <b>systems,</b> <b>voltage</b> fluctuation {{is a common}} phenomenon. Most of the voltage fluctuation problems result from {{the changes in the}} system’s reactive power resulting from excessive supply or consumption of reactive power by the elements of the system and the variation in the consumers’ loads. In this paper, the effect of Static Var Compensator (SVC) in stabilizing power <b>system’s</b> <b>voltage</b> through effective reactive power compensation was investigated. Power flow equations involving voltage drop with/without SVC were developed. SVC modeling equations were also developed and used to determine its parameters. Based on the SVC parameters, SIMULINK blocks were used to implement the phase controlled Thyristor–Controlled-Reactor Fixed-Capacitor (TCR-FC) SVC. The Nigerian 28 -bus power system used for the study was also modeled using SIMULINK/MATLAB. The 28 -bus system was first simulated without SVC and then with two SVCs located at different buses to obtain the bus voltages in both cases. From the bus voltages the total voltage drops for the system with and without SVC were estimated and compared.

5000|$|In {{transmission}} applications, the SVC is used {{to regulate}} the grid voltage. If the power system's reactive load is capacitive (leading), the SVC will use thyristor controlled reactors to consume VARs from the system, lowering the <b>system</b> <b>voltage.</b> Under inductive (lagging) conditions, the capacitor banks are automatically switched in, thus providing a higher <b>system</b> <b>voltage.</b> By connecting the thyristor-controlled reactor, which is continuously variable, along with a capacitor bank step, {{the net result is}} continuously variable leading or lagging power.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} to identify and to characterize voltage dips measurements from power quality survey.
