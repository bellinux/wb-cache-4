5|$|The flight {{feathers}} {{of the wing}} comprise 10 primaries, the outermost being very small, and 13 <b>secondaries,</b> and there are 12 tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} India, they moult their feathers from June to October. The wing moult {{begins in}} July {{with the first}} primary and proceeds towards the tenth. <b>Secondaries</b> are replaced from August after the primaries are at the third quill. The secondary moult is not orderly, the 8th and 7th being dropped earlier than the rest. The tail feathers are moulted centrifugally. Seasonal colour changes in the testicular tissues are caused by variation in melanin synthesis, with the dark pigmentation being lost during the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|The area {{above the}} eyes, {{including}} the forehead, crown and nape, {{is a deep}} blue-black, through {{the top edge of}} the mantle. The mantle proper is a medium to dark gray-blue as are the tertials and upperwing-coverts, turning to a dark gray at the median, greater and primary coverts and the alula. The <b>secondaries</b> and inner primaries are fringed in gray-blue. The central rectrices are gray-blue, and the outer rectrices are a blackish-gray, paling towards the tips.|$|E

5|$|Ninox boobook fusca {{is found}} on Timor, Roma, Leti and Semau Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Veillot in 1817 as Strix fusca. It has a more grey-brown plumage with no red tinge, unlike other subspecies. it has grey streaks on its belly and white spots on its <b>secondaries,</b> inner wing-coverts and nape. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species. Its calls are shorter and more frequent than subspecies boobook.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} small swallow, the nominate subspecies has bronze upperparts and bronze {{sides of the}} head. The ears and lores are duller and the forehead area is more green than bronze. The shoulders, back, rump, and uppertail-coverts are, on the other hand, a coppery-bronze colour. The lesser and median coverts are more coppery, with the greater and primary-wing-coverts being more of a dusky green. The primaries, <b>secondaries,</b> and tail are a dusky bronze-green. The underparts are mostly white. The legs, feet, and irides are dark brown, and the bill is black. The female is similar but with a mottled grey-brown breast and occasionally throat and undertail-coverts. The juvenile is also mottled-grey brown, in addition to it being duller overall. The extant subspecies, T. e. sclateri, is primarily differentiated by its more deeply forked tail, blue-green forehead and uppertail-coverts, and blue-black wings and tail.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight {{feathers}} at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, <b>secondaries</b> inward, and the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Scharnhorst arrived in Norway in March 1943, Allied convoys to the Soviet Union had {{temporarily}} ceased. To give the ships {{an opportunity to}} work together, Admiral Karl Dönitz, who had replaced Raeder {{in the aftermath of}} the Battle of the Barents Sea on 31 December 1942, ordered an attack on the island of Spitzbergen, which housed a British weather station and refuelling base. Several settlements and outposts on Spitzbergen were defended by a garrison of 152 men from the Norwegian Armed Forces in exile. The two battleships, escorted by ten destroyers, left port on 6 September; in a ruse de guerre, Tirpitz flew the white ensign on the approach to the island the following day. During the bombardment, Tirpitz fired 52 main-battery shells and 82 rounds from her 15cm <b>secondaries.</b> This was the first and only time the ship fired her main battery at an enemy surface target. An assault force destroyed shore installations and captured 74 prisoners. By 11:00, the battleships had destroyed their targets and headed back to their Norwegian ports.|$|E
5|$|Some herons, such as {{the black}} heron, adopt an unusual {{position}} while hunting for prey. With their head held down in a hunting position, they sweep their wings forward to meet {{in front of their}} head, thereby forming an umbrella shaped canopy. The primaries and <b>secondaries</b> touch the water, the nape feathers are erected and the tail is drooped, thereby ensuring the canopy is totally enclosed. The bird may take several strides in this position. One theory about the function of this behaviour is that it reduces glare from the water surface, allowing the bird to more easily locate and catch prey. Alternatively, the shade provided by the canopy may attract fish making their capture easier. Some herons adopt a similar behaviour called double-wing feeding in which the wings are swept forward to create an area of shade, though a canopy is not formed.|$|E

5|$|The face, lores, throat, breast, {{belly and}} rump {{of this species}} are white; the undersides are tinged with grey on the chest and yellow on the belly. The crown is glossy black in males. The nape is pale grey with a grey-white to white band {{separating}} the crown from the back. The wings are dusky greyish brown with white edging on the inner remiges and wing-coverts. The tail is dusky brown, and the stout bill, iris and legs are black. The female {{is similar to the}} male, but is duller overall and has a chestnut-tinged crown. Juvenile birds resemble adults but have greyish napes and more chestnut in the crown, and the feathers of the back, rump and primaries are scalloped with ochre. The <b>secondaries</b> on the wing and the tail feathers are edged with white.|$|E
5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} in several ways. It {{is larger than the}} lesser yellow-headed vulture, with a longer, broader tail. The plumage is a dark, glossy black in contrast to the lesser yellow-headed vulture's browner plumage. Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of the lesser yellow-headed vulture. Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier. Unlike {{the other members of the}} genus Cathartes, the greater yellow-headed vulture has relatively dark inner primaries, which contrast slightly with the paler <b>secondaries</b> and outer primaries. The greater yellow-headed vulture prefers to live in forests while the lesser yellow-headed vulture prefers to inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than the lesser yellow-headed vulture. The greater yellow-headed vulture is also somewhat larger than the turkey vulture. It can be distinguished from that species only at relatively close range by the differing head coloration. The underwing coloration is similar to the turkey vulture but the greater yellow-headed usually has a faint but broad and dark band vertically down the middle of the wings.|$|E
5|$|The adult green rosella has {{a yellow}} head and underparts with blue cheeks and red band on the {{forehead}} and upper lores. The yellow feathers of the forecrown, lower lores, cheeks, chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow feathers of the sides and rear {{of the head and}} neck, and the underparts have dark brown bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint scalloping, which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow feathers of the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow {{of the back of the}} head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or dark brown with green margins. The feathers of the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These margins and tips are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more solid black. The blue-violet feathers of the chin, throat and cheeks have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers and tips. The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted dark brown primaries and outer <b>secondaries.</b> Underneath the feathers of the wings are dark brown with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent.|$|E
