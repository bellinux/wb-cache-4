5000|$|The {{gameplay}} of Dawn of War II is {{markedly different}} from that of Dawn of War and its expansions, especially considering that building your own bases is completely removed. Jonny Ebbert, the game's lead designer, describes the feel of the game by saying that it [...] "takes everything that was great about the original and combines it with the best that Company of Heroes had to offer." [...] There is a heavier focus on cover, which gives more substantial defensive bonuses. Accordingly, there is also new emphasis on methods of dealing with units in cover. Some weapons, such as grenades and other explosives, can destroy cover, while others, such as flamers, ignore cover bonuses completely. Other differences between Dawn of War II and its predecessors include improved unit AI (squads under fire seek cover, for example), more realistically sized vehicles, and an improved physics engine, though the ai is easy to manipulate, by means such as placing <b>suppression</b> <b>squads</b> which the ai will instantly know have been placed and avoid, thus allowing you to funnel the army to your needs. This game also includes a fall back command which the ai will use somewhat liberally, making the squad or command unit fall back at a higher speed and become resistant to range damage while being more vulnerable to melee.|$|R

50|$|A {{version of}} Dirge {{appeared}} in the 2008 April Fools comic by Fun Publications. He was a Pretender member of the Mayhem <b>Suppression</b> <b>Squad</b> commanded by Colonel Deathsaurus. His engines can generate a vibration which cause uncontrollable crippling laughter in his targets. It rapidly loses interest if things become boring and predictable.|$|E
50|$|Anti-Freedom Fighters/Suppression Squad - {{counterparts}} of the Knothole Freedom Fighters from {{an alternate}} dimension known as Anti-Mobius or Moebius. Whereas the Freedom Fighters stood {{to restore order}} and freedom, the Anti-Freedom Fighters wrought anarchy upon their home, including deposing King Maxx Acorn. This group appeared to impersonate and pester the Freedom Fighters on several occasions after Sonic first visited their home dimension, and Antoine's counterpart impersonated him {{for an extended period}} of time that led to the poisoning of King Acorn and the poisoning and death of Antoine's father Armand. After absorbing energy from the Master Emerald and gaining a new appearance, the former Evil Sonic rechristened himself Scourge the Hedgehog and joined the evil Destructix. Having previously dated several of the women from his world, he found a permanent love interest in Mobius Prime's Fiona Fox, whose unfortunate life experiences led her to embrace the dark path offered by Scourge. After serving in the Destructix under Dr. Finitevus, the pair returned to Moebius, where Scourge made himself king and forced his former teammates to undergo drastic changes. Now known as the <b>Suppression</b> <b>Squad,</b> their membership included Princess Alicia (Anti-Sally), Miles (Anti-Tails), Boomer (Anti-Rotor), and Patch (Anti-Antoine). Former members of the group also included Jeffrey St. Croix, who later ended up in the No Zone Jail with Maxx, and Buns Rabbot, Bunnie Rabbot's fully organic counterpart who dated Scourge before developing a disease that led to her expulsion from the group. Enemies of the <b>Suppression</b> <b>Squad</b> included O'Nux, the Anti-Knuckles and his Orderix associates; Dr. Kintobor, a kindly version of Dr. Robotnik; and Rosy the Rascal, a deranged counterpart to Amy Rose. The <b>Suppression</b> <b>Squad</b> later teamed up with the Freedom Fighters to defeat Scourge, putting an end to his and Fiona's membership in the team.|$|E

5000|$|In the 2008 April Fool's Day comic [...] "Shattered Expectations", Razorclaw (and {{possibly}} others) {{were victims}} of a shrink ray. That did not stop Razorclaw and Starscream from attacking Grimlock, Jazz, and Goldbug, eventually summoning the Mayhem <b>Suppression</b> <b>Squad</b> to celebrate April Fools' Day finish them off. In [...] "Shattered Glass", Razorclaw {{appears to be a}} key member of Megatron's inner circle. When the Decepticons attacked the Ark, the Predacons Razorclaw and Rampage would take down the guards while Divebomb accompanied Starscream and Whisper in bombing the fuel tanks. All three Predacons would later keep Grimlock at bay. The Predacons were fairly small in beast mode, but average height in robot mode. In [...] "Shattered Destiny", it is shown that the Predacons later became a faction of their own, led by another heroic Megatron, starting their universe's version of the Beast Era.|$|E
50|$|Fiona Fox - {{a female}} Fox who was {{captured}} by Dr. Robotnik in her youth and shared her captivity with Sonic, Mighty, and Ray the Flying Squirrel. Fiona {{was used as the}} basis for an Auto-Automaton robot, and regrettably left behind when Sonic and Mighty made their escape. Eventually breaking out of the prison herself, she became a hardened mercenary alongside the likes of Nic the Weasel, Bark the Polar Bear, and Bean the Dynamite. She eventually crossed paths Mighty and Sonic again, and ended up joining the Knothole Freedom Fighters upon recognizing Sonic's heroism and that he had not intended to leave her behind. Unfortunately, incidents of her criminal past-including dealings with Rouge the Bat-continued to plague her, and she found herself attracted to Sonic's evil doppelgänger Scourge, who was impersonating Sonic at the time. Fiona attempted for a time to establish a relationship with the real Sonic-much to the dismay of Tails, who {{had fallen in love with}} her robotic clone-but found herself drawn to the darker and more dangerous Scourge. She eventually defected from the Freedom Fighters, joining the Destructix alongside Scourge and later taking over the <b>Suppression</b> <b>Squad</b> alongside. After being betrayed by Scourge's original teammates, Fiona recruited the leaderless Destructix, and later brought Scourge back into the group after helping him escape from prison.|$|E
