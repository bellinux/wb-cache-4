25|$|Health, {{safety and}} {{environmental}} aspects of nanocellulose have been recently evaluated. Processing of nanocellulose {{does not cause}} significant exposure to fine particles during friction grinding or <b>spray</b> <b>drying.</b> No evidence of inflammatory effects or cytotoxicity on mouse or human macrophages can be observed after exposure to nanocellulose. The results of toxicity studies suggest that nanocellulose is not cytotoxic and does not cause any effects on inflammatory system in macrophages. In addition, nanocellulose is not acutely toxic to Vibrio fischeri in environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Finally, infant {{formulas}} are {{heat treated}} {{to maintain the}} bacteriologic quality of the product. This can be done traditionally by either retort sterilization or high-temperature short-time (HTST) treatment. Recently, ultrahigh-temperature treated formula has become more commonly used. If powdered formula is made, then <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> would be required in addition. Retort sterilization is a traditional retort sterilization method that uses 10-15mins treatment at 118°C. Ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) is a method that uses a brief (2–3 seconds) treatment at 142°C. Because of the short time used, there is little protein denaturation, but the process still ensures sterility of the final product.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{anti-inflammatory}} and antiallodynic {{effects of}} <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders starting from leaves, stems, roots, {{the mixture of}} leaves and stems, {{as well as the}} whole plant aqueous solutions of Phyllanthus niruri L., Phyllanthaceae, were assessed. Gallic acid, used as chemical marker, was quantified by HPLC in the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders. Carrageenan-induced inflammatory and allodynic responses in the mouse paw were used as pharmacological models. Quantitative and qualitative differences among chemical composition of different herb parts were observed. The oral administration of leaves or leaves plus stems <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders (100 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the carrageenan-induced allodynic effect (42 ± 5 and 54 ± 3 %, respectively). Additionally, the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of leaves significantly reduced carrageenan-induced paw oedema (35 ± 6 %). The <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of roots, stems, or the mixture of leaves, stems and roots (100 mg/kg, p. o.) did not exhibit antiallodynic or antioedematogenic effect in the same model. In conclusion, differences in the chemical composition of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders from P. niruri are reflected in their in vivo pharmacological actions. Despite of a direct relationship of anti-inflammatory and antiallodynic effects with the gallic acid content had been observed, especially in the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of leaves, the use of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of leaves plus stems showed to be more effective, suggesting a synergic effect between their constituents...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of growth}} {{promoting}} and therapeutic antibiotics in piglet feed {{has been a}} concerning subject {{over the last few}} decades because of the risk of generating antimicrobial resistance that could be transferred to humans. As a result, many products have been proposed as potential alternatives to the use of antibiotics, and among these, <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma {{is considered one of the}} most promising. However, there have been concerns about its biosafety, particularly during periods of emergence or re-emergence of swine diseases in different regions of the world, such as the recent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus outbreak in North America. The objectives of this paper are to review recent publications about the use of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma as an alternative to antibiotics in weaned pig diets, the possible mechanisms of action of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma, and the existing evidence related to the biosafety of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> animal plasma. Particular attention is given to studies in which <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma has been directly compared to antibiotics or other alternative antimicrobial products. Several studies on the possible modes of action for <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma, such as preservation of gut barrier function or modulation of the immune response, are also reviewed. Finally, the paper focuses on the review of the existing studies on the risks of disease transmission with the use of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma from porcine origin. Overall, <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma is a promising alternative to in-feed antimicrobials for piglets, particularly during the early stages of the post-weaning phase. Additionally, there is enough evidence to support that commercial <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> porcine plasma is a safe product for pigs...|$|R
40|$|Achyrocline satureioides (Lam.) DC., Asteraceae, is a herbal specie {{widely used}} in folk {{medicine}} {{in the south of}} Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay. The technological characteristics of an Achyrocline satureioides <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> extract powder, produced in semi-industrial scale, as well as the feasibility of the granules are reported in the present work. The <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powder was characterized as a fine powder consisting of small spherical particles with rough and porous surface. The Hausner's factor, Carr's index, and densification index of the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powder were, respectively, 1, 23, 18, 9 %, and 27, 2 mL, characterizing it as a poor flow and low density powder. The preparation of granules from this <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powder, through dry disaggregation method, yielded irregularly shaped granules, with a rough surface, but with better flow and compactability characteristics. These granules presented a Hausner's factor, a Carr's index, and a densification index of, respectively, 1, 09, 8, 16 %, and 12, 33 mL. The LC assay of the main polyphenols, quercetin, luteolin, and 3 -O-methylquercetin revealed that the granulation process did not changed the quantitative and qualitative profile of these constituents originally present in the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powder.

40|$|Purpose: To {{show for}} the first time the {{superior}} dry powder inhaler (DPI) performance of freeze dried mannitol in comparison to <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> mannitol and commercial mannitol. Methods: Different mannitol powders were sieved to collect 63 - 90 μm particles and then analyzed in terms of size, shape, surface morphology, solid state, density, flowability. Salbutamol sulphate-mannitol aerosol formulations were evaluated in terms of homogeneity, SS-mannitol adhesion, and in vitro aerosolization performance. Results: Freeze dried mannitol demonstrated superior DPI performance with a fine particle fraction believed to be highest so far reported in literature for salbutamol sulphate under similar protocols (FPF = 46. 9 %). To lesser extent, <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> mannitol produced better aerosolization performance than commercial mannitol. Freeze dried mannitol demonstrated elongated morphology, α-+β-+δ- polymorphic forms, and poor flowability whereas <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> mannitol demonstrated spherical morphology, α-+β- polymorphic forms, and excellent flowability. Commercial mannitol demonstrated angular morphology, β- polymorphic form, and good flowability. Freeze dried mannitol demonstrated smoother surface than <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> mannitol which in turn demonstrated smoother surface than commercial mannitol. FPF of SS increased as mannitol powder porosity increase. Conclusions: Freeze drying under controlled conditions can be used as a potential technique to generate aerodynamically light mannitol particles for superior DPI performance. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a dry powder {{isoniazid}} formulation with no or a limited amount of excipients for pulmonary administration. Milled isoniazid showed an excellent particle size distribution for inhalation, however dispersion was poor. In 78 % of the dispersion measurements the inhaler blocked, retaining most of its dose. Pure <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> isoniazid yielded particles too large for pulmonary delivery, but the addition of 5 % of L-leucine resulted in <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> particles of inhalable size. DSC data showed complete crystallinity for all samples, while TGA analysis showed that isoniazid sublimates around 100 °C. SEM imaging showed that pure jet milled and <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> isoniazid particles fused together. Isoniazid <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> with L-leucine resulted in spherical particles with no fusion visible. The most likely explanation for particle fusion is that isoniazid crystalizes, resulting in solid bridge formation. L-leucine however, forms a coating around isoniazid particles, thereby preventing this phenomenon. Further experiments are needed to show why isoniazid fuses together in the jet mill. A possible explanation is that some isoniazid sublimates due to heat generation during particle collisions, and causes solid bridge formation between particles when it ripens. Further experiments have to show whether isoniazid co-spray dried with L-leucine disperses efficiently and is stable over time...|$|R
