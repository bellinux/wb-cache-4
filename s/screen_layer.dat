The earth screen is modeled by a single-layer with properties such that the transient behavior of the actual cable is reproduced. The first approach aims to equate the impedances and admittances of both models by varying parameters of the single-layer sheath model to optimize the match with the doublelayer cable sheath. In the second approach {{the differences between the}} ABCD matrices of both models are minimized. By analyzing the ABCD matrices a method is developed to obtain a close match for transient behavior between single- and doublelayer models. Analysis of the accuracy of the results shows a good match for the investigated cable...|$|E
30|$|Low-energy (1 to 20  keV) ion {{implantation}} of various impurities into Si {{is commonly used}} to make super-shallow p-n junctions[1, 2] and to form a variety of quantum-sized objects[3, 4]. Implantation of dopants such as B, P, As, and Sb into Si is usually made through a thin (3 to 5  nm) silicon oxide protective (<b>screen)</b> <b>layer.</b> Interaction of accelerated ions with oxygen atoms inside the screen oxide layer leads to generation of recoil oxygen atoms. The latter penetrate into Si substrate and stimulate the quasi-chemical reactions of matrix atoms and point defects in the Si surface layer. In particular, it was shown[5] that oxygen atoms influence the processes of As deactivation and its segregation at the SiO 2 -Si interface. The effect of recoil atoms is especially important when using {{ion implantation}} to form nanoscale objects in the surface region. Also, {{a significant number of}} carbon atoms are incorporated into a silicon matrix, because the absorption of carbon contaminants always occurs during the process of ion implantation.|$|E

40|$|Electrical {{structures}} in two thunderstorm anvil clouds (or 'anvils'), one in New Mexico, {{the other in}} Oklahoma, were investigated, using measurements of electric field by balloon-carried instruments and a one-dimensional model to calculate the time and spatial variations of electrical parameters in the clear air below the anvil. The electric field soundings through the two thunderstorm anvils showed similar charge structures; namely, negatively charged <b>screening</b> <b>layers</b> {{on the top and}} the bottom surfaces, a layer of positive charge in the interior, and one or two layers of zero charge. It is suggested that the positive charge originated in the main positive charge region normally found at high altitudes in the core of thunderclouds, and the negatively charged layers probably formed as <b>screening</b> <b>layers,</b> resulting from the discontinuity in the electrical conductivity at the cloud boundaries...|$|R
40|$|An exact, {{analytic}} {{solution for}} a simple electrostatic model applicable to biomolecular recognition is presented. In the model, a layer of high dielectric constant material (representative of the solvent, water) whose thickness may vary separates two regions of low dielectric constant material (representative of proteins, DNA, RNA, or similar materials), in {{each of which is}} embedded a point charge. For identical charges, the presence of the <b>screening</b> <b>layer</b> always lowers the energy compared to the case of point charges in an infinite medium of low dielectric constant. Somewhat surprisingly, the presence of a sufficiently thick <b>screening</b> <b>layer</b> also lowers the energy compared to the case of point charges in an infinite medium of high dielectric constant. For charges of opposite sign, the <b>screening</b> <b>layer</b> always lowers the energy compared to the case of point charges in an infinite medium of either high or low dielectric constant. The behavior of the energy leads to a substantially increased repulsive force between charges of the same sign. The repulsive force between charges of opposite signs is weaker than in an infinite medium of low dielectric constant material but stronger than in an infinite medium of high dielectric constant material. The presence of this behavior, which we name asymmetric screening, in the simple system presented here confirms the generality of the behavior that was established in a more complicated system of an arbitrary number of charged dielectric spheres in an infinite solvent.

40|$|We {{consider}} the translocation of a neutral (uncharged) nanoparticle through a pore {{in a thin}} membrane with constant surface charge density. If the concomitant Debye <b>screening</b> <b>layer</b> is sufficiently thin, the resulting forces experienced by the particle on {{its way through the}} pore are negligible. But when the Debye length becomes comparable to the pore diameter, the particle encounters a quite significant potential barrier while approaching and entering the pore, and symmetrically upon exiting the pore. The main reason is an increasing pressure which acts on the particle when it intrudes into the counter ion cloud of the Debye <b>screening</b> <b>layer.</b> In case the polarizability of the particle is different (usually smaller) than that of the ambient fluid, a second, much smaller contribution to the potential barrier is due to self-energy effects. Our numerical treatment of the problem is complemented by analytical approximations for sufficiently long cylindrical particles and pores, which agree very well with the numerics...|$|R

The cells were assembled by combining planar ITO substrates and gold-coated hemispherical micro-mirrors. Optical reflection images showed a remarkable change of symmetry in the back-reflected, polarised light when an external voltage was applied. Theoretical modelling of the alignment of the liquid crystals, confined in microstructured cells, {{was carried out in}} parallel with the experimental work. The motion of defects under the effect of the applied cross-sections of simulated molecular director inside the microcavity for 0 V (top) and 10 V (bottom) electric field was predicted and this effect can be responsible for the change of symmetry of the back-reflected light. Surface charging effects are also studied, the results indicate that the reorientation grating originates from the build-up and discharge of surface charge <b>screening</b> <b>layers,</b> spatially modulated due to the photoconductivity of doped poly(N-vinyl carbazole) (PVK).

40|$|Het Nieuwe Telen (The New Growing) {{results in}} {{applying}} more <b>screen</b> <b>layers</b> that stay completely closed. In practise this causes problems with drip. In this research {{the impact of}} 2 <b>screen</b> <b>layers</b> and using <b>screen</b> gaps {{on the amount of}} drip from the screens or the greenhouse cover is investigated. Solutions to reduce the problems related to drip were proposed and tested in the greenhouse. During spring and winter 2016, measurements were performed at a tomato greenhouse with artificial lighting, blackout screen, energy screen and a Ventilationjet system. The daily amount of the condensation water that drips from the greenhouse ridge, gutter and the Ventilationjet was determined. In contrast to the general expectations, the drip does not come from the screens but from the greenhouse cover and from the Ventilationjets. Condensation occurred at the screens but this did not result in drip from these screens. Only 0. 2 % of the condensation against the greenhouse cover drips into the greenhouse. If this drip would be re evaporated, the energy costs for heating would increase with 0. 0008 m 3 gas /m 2 /week. Investments to reduce drip can thus only be paid back by a better crop quality and not by energy savings. The use of the inlet ventilator of the Ventilationjet system or the use of a screen gap increases the amount of condensation on a cold greenhouse cover. Drip from the greenhouse gutter was solved by applying a condensation gutter and the drip from the duct of the Ventilationjet was solved by applying a collecting tray with drain hose...|$|R

Effect of OPS in electron-hole liquid with close-by <b>screening</b> <b>layers</b> is studied. We find that OPS affects the electronic properties in low density and long wavelength regime. The corresponding zero-temperature phase diagram is obtained within a mean field treatment. We argue that our result is in general relevant to other heterostrucutures.

The wave pattern of the flow and the mechanism of wave interaction with the layer, including the dynamics of the layer boundary depending on the layer thickness and rarefaction-wave width, are determined. The mathematical model proposed is verified against the dependence of the layer-boundary coordinate on time and also the dependence of the velocity of upward motion of the layer on the difference in pressures between the high-pressure and low-pressure chambers.

In the present experiment, the screen mesh size, number of <b>screen</b> <b>layers,</b> packing condition of the screen and flow rate were varied.

The electrostatic energy and the entropy stored in the <b>screening</b> <b>layer</b> are major factors in determining the occupancy of the boundary levels. The screening effects depend strongly on temperature and the doping conditions : in n type germanium a depleted layer is found at low temperatures, with a gradual evolution towards an inversion layer in the high temperature range. In p type germanium the depleted layer transforms into an accumulation layer through a neutral temperature. The barrier effect is much stronger in n than in p type germanium, in agreement with available experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recent {{transport}} {{experiments have}} established that two-dimensional electron systems with high-index partial Landau level filling, ν ∗ = ν − [ν], have ground states with broken orientational symmetry. In a mean-field theory, the broken symmetry state consists of electron stripes with local filling factor [ν] + 1, separated by hole stripes with filling factor [ν]. We have recently developed {{a theory of}} these states in which the electron stripes are treated as one-dimensional electron systems coupled by interactions and described by using a Luttinger liquid model. Among other things, this theory predicts non-linearities of opposite sign in easy and hard direction resistivities. In this article we briefly review our theory, focusing on its predictions for the dependence of non-linear transport exponents on the separation d between the twodimensional electron system and a co-planar <b>screening</b> <b>layer.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The Solar Heating and Lighting Program has set {{the goal}} of {{reducing}} the cost of solar water heating systems by at least 50 %. An attractive approach to such large cost reduction is to replace glass and metal parts with less-expensive, lighter-weight, more-integrated polymeric components.

The objective of this task is to quantify lifetimes through measurement of the optical and mechanical stability of candidate polymeric glazing and absorber materials. Polycarbonate sheet glazings, as proposed by two industry partners, have been tested for resistance to UV radiation with three complementary methods. Incorporation of a specific 2 -mil thick UV-absorbing <b>screening</b> <b>layer</b> results in glazing lifetimes of at least 15 years; improved screens promise even longer lifetimes.

Piezo-response force microscopy (PFM) studies reveal d_ 33 ^MAPbI_ 3 values of 0. 3 pm/V for MAPbI_ 3 deposited on Au and ITO surfaces, with small phase angles fluctuating at length scales smaller than the grain size. In sharp contrast, on samples prepared on epitaxial PZT films, we observe large scale polar domains exhibiting clear, close to 90 PFM phase angles, pointing to polar axes along the film normal. By separating the contributions from the MAPbI_ 3 and PZT layers, we extract a significantly enhanced d_ 33 ^MAPbI_ 3 value of 4 pm/V, which is attributed to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction facilitated domain nucleation.

40|$|It {{is rarely}} {{the case that}} a single {{electron}} affects the behaviour of several hundred thousands of atoms. Here we demonstrate a phenomenon where this happens.

For topological insulators, {{the effects of these}} surface states will be more strongly pronounced in the case of nanoparticles. Here we show that under the influence of light a single electron in a topologically protected surface state creates a surface charge density similar to a plasmon in a metallic nanoparticle. Such an electron can act as a <b>screening</b> <b>layer,</b> which suppresses absorption inside the particle.

Comparing the relaxation behavior in ambient air with that in argon gas, we find that the relaxation time in argon is much shorter than that in air, and the relaxation in air is dominated by the space charge transport phenomena.

40|$|In this work, {{we treat}} the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) {{equations}} {{as the basis}} for a consistent framework of the electrokinetic effects. The static limit of the PNP equations is shown to be the charge-conserving Poisson-Boltzmann (CCPB) equation, with guaranteed charge neutrality within the computational domain. We propose a surface potential trap model that attributes an energy cost to the interfacial charge dissociation. In conjunction with the CCPB, the surface potential trap can cause a surface-specific adsorbed charge layer σ. By defining a chemical potential μ that arises from the charge neutrality constraint, a reformulated CCPB can be reduced to the form of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, whose prediction of the Debye <b>screening</b> <b>layer</b> profile is in excellent agreement with that of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation when the channel width is much larger than the Debye length. However, important differences emerge when the channel width is small, so the Debye <b>screening</b> <b>layers</b> from the opposite sides of the channel overlap with each other. In particular, the theory automatically yields a variation of σ that is generally known as the “charge regulation” behavior, attendant with predictions of force variation as a function of nanoscale separation between two charged surfaces that are in good agreement with the experiments, with no adjustable or additional parameters. We give a generalized definition of the ζ potential that reflects the strength of the electrokinetic effect; its variations with the concentration of surface-specific and surface-nonspecific salt ions are shown to be in good agreement with the experiments. To delineate the behavior of the electro-osmotic (EO) effect, the coupled PNP and Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically under an applied electric field tangential to the fluid-solid interface. The EO effect is shown to exhibit an intrinsic time dependence that is noninertial in its origin. Under a step-function applied electric field, a pulse of fluid flow is followed by relaxation to a new ion distribution, owing to the diffusive counter current. We have numerically evaluated the Onsager coefficients associated with the EO effect, L_{ 21 }, and its reverse streaming potential effect, L_{ 12 }, and show that L_{ 12 }=L_{ 21 } in accordance with the Onsager relation.
