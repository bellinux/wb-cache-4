40|$|Universities {{operate in}} institutionally pluralistic environments (Frølich et al. 2013), being exposed and {{responding}} to a complex combination of global, national and local dynamics (see Marginson and Rhoades 2002 about glonacal agency). Due {{to the rise of}} the Europe of Knowledge (Chou and Gornitzka 2014; Elken et al. 2011; Maassen and Olsen 2007), the situation is even more complicated for European universities which are expected to contribute to building the EHEA and the ERA, but which are also increasingly affected by decisions taken at the European level by inter-governmental, supranational as well as transnational actors (Börzel 2010; Elken and Vukasovic 2014). The increasing relevance of the global dynamics (e. g. rankings, global competition for talent and resources) and the aforementioned European developments have been accompanied by the increasing numbers and visibility of various types of university alliances. A brief internet survey revealed more than 25 university networks operating within Europe, with additional 10 which also have members/partners in countries beyond Europe. University alliances may be said to capture key dimensions in multi-level governance (Piattoni 2010) as they provide a link between micro- and macro level decision-making, enabling insight into the internal dynamic of lobbying, positioning and strategizing. In general, organizations seek alliances when they perceive their strategic position as vulnerable, when they are located in highly competitive sectors, or embedded in very uncertain environments (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven 1996). However, while these factors may explain the drivers to form alliances, it is more unclear how such alliances organize their internal work and how they work towards the European level. In an institutional perspective, it is possible to outline two different interpretations of these processes. The first interpretation is to see such alliances as a continuation of historical and institutional characteristics of the field of higher education, affecting the internal organizations of the alliances and their approach towards the European level. The second interpretation is to see such alliances as a more radical break with the traditional ways of organizing the international dimensions of university life, and that the alliances could be perceived as a form of de- and re-institutionalization of the sector as they might imply both new ways to organize collaboration and to influence the European level. These two ways will be used as lenses to analyse how two European alliances – the European University Association (EUA) and the League of European Research Universities (LERU) – are trying to influence European policy. EUA is essentially a broad, non-elite organization whose members are universities and rectors’ conferences of European countries (850 members from 47 countries). Although it was formally founded in 2001, it is actually a result of a merger of organizations, one of which (CRE) {{can be traced back to}} the early days of European integration (Corbett 2005). It has been recognised by European decision-makers as representing the interests of universities on the European level (e. g. by being a consultative member of the BFUG) on issues ranging from internationalization, through quality assurance, governance and funding, to research. LERU was founded in 2002 and is a much smaller organization (21 members from 10 countries), comprising arguably elite universities (more than ¾ of members are ranked in the top 100 in ARWU), with a much narrower advocacy focus (basic research), but without an officially recognised status on the European level. While both alliances act as European level interest groups (Beyers et al. 2008; Eising 2008), they do so on different issues (very broad vs. rather narrow), in different ways (formal vs. informal influence, insider vs. (partial) outsider strategies) and on behalf of different constituencies (non-elite vs. elite). Empirically, the starting point will be the strategic instruments these organizations use for lobbying and strategic positioning, i. e. official policy documents and statements, but also projects, events (conferences and <b>seminars)</b> <b>and</b> <b>media</b> material (incl. websites) and interviews with key actors in EUA and LERU. This material will provide input used to identify potential patterns indicating the role these alliances have in the European knowledge policy creation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background During {{recent years}} the market for homeopathic {{education}} media has increasingly diversified with old (books, <b>seminars)</b> <b>and</b> new <b>media</b> (video-seminars, pc-programs, homeo-wiki and internet-courses). However, {{little is known about}} homeopaths’ preferences in using educational <b>media</b> <b>and</b> their requirements of this topic. Aim This survey was designed {{to gain a better understanding}} of the usage and appraisal of educational media by homeopaths. Methods 192 homeopathic practitioners (GPs and health practitioners) at a educational conference were asked to answer a standardized questionnaire covering the topics “formal education and context of work” (9 items), “homeopathic practise and usage (24 items), “utilization of educational media” (9 items) and “favoured attributes for educational media” (11 items). Results Out of 192 homeopaths who attended the conference, 118 completed the questionnaire (response rate 61. 5 %). For their continuing homeopathic education they predominantly indicated to use books (scale value from 0 [*]=[*]never to 2 [*]=[*]always: 1. 72) <b>and</b> <b>seminars</b> (1. 54) whereas journals (0. 98) and the internet (0. 65) were used less often. The most favoured attributes concerning medical education media were reliability (1. 76), relevance for clinical practice (1. 74) and user friendliness (1. 6). Less favoured attributes were inexpensiveness (1. 1), graphical material (0. 92) and interactivity (0. 88). Conclusions The survey illustrates the current situation of medical education media in homeopathy. Although there are parallels to earlier research conducted in conventional GPs, homeopaths are more likely to refer to classical media. New education tools should be designed according to these preferences. </p...|$|R
40|$|Anthracnose in lupins, {{caused by}} Colletotrichum lupini, was first {{detected}} in commercial crops in Western Australia (WA) in 1996. This incursion of an exotic plant pathogen into Australia constituted a major biosecurity {{threat to the}} local lupin industry. The disease caught the industry unawares {{with the majority of}} cultivars at that time being susceptible and there were major issues with local plant pathologists and lupin agronomists having very little exposure to diagnosis and management of this disease. In 1997, the first major breakthrough was made when resistance to anthracnose was confirmed in several breeding lines and commercial cultivars of narrow–leafed lupins (Lupinus angustifolius), and landraces of Lupinus albus. These findings led to the release of cultivars with elevated levels of resistance to the disease. Important information on relative yield loss, critical seed infection levels, fungicide seed treatment and geographical risk factors have also been discovered through applied research leading to use of seed testing and registered fungicides for the control of early infection. In addition, a spatio–temporal model was developed to simulate the spread of anthracnose initiated by infected seed and other sources. The modelling has contributed to the formulation of strategies for management of lupin anthracnose. An extension campaign through field days, <b>seminars</b> <b>and</b> regular <b>media</b> exposure promoted the management package developed from the research...|$|R
