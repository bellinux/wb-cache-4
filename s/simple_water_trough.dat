40|$|Installation of <b>water</b> <b>troughs</b> is {{a common}} {{approach}} to increase densities of small game species in the Iberian peninsula but {{little is known about}} the watering patterns of target species, such as the wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Using camera trapping, we monitored the use of <b>water</b> <b>troughs</b> by wild rabbits over 228 weeks in three consecutive periods, from June to October in 2008, 2009 and 2010, on farmland in north–west Spain. Wild rabbits used 43 % of the <b>water</b> <b>troughs.</b> A significantly higher number of rabbits were observed drinking at troughs surrounded by shrub cover than at those in open fields. Most drinking events were recorded from July to September (98 %), though the use of <b>water</b> <b>troughs</b> was not clearly related to weather. Wild rabbits drank mainly during the morning (52 % of rabbits), less so in the evening and at night, and rarely in the afternoon. Wild rabbits were photographed together with red–legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) in 6 % of photographs. These findings suggest <b>water</b> <b>troughs</b> are useful for species such as wild rabbits and should be allocated close to shrub areas...|$|R

50|$|An {{abreuvoir}} is a <b>watering</b> <b>trough,</b> fountain, {{or other}} installed basin: {{originally intended to}} provide humans and/or animals a rural or urban watering place with fresh drinking water.

40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a influência de dois tipos de bebedouros nipple e taça, utilizados na dessedentação de aves de postura e o incremento da demanda de cloro na água oferecida pelos dois tipos de bebedouros estudados. Foram {{realizadas}} as contagens de coliformes totais, coliformes fecais, Escherichia coli, estreptococos fecais e microrganismos mesófilos. Os resultados obtidos figuraram que as amostras de água dos reservatórios, de ambos os bebedouros, apresentaram-se contaminadas microbiologicamente antes de passarem pelos bebedouros. A contaminação por bactérias de poluição fecal foi maior nas amostras colhidas nos bebedouros tipo taça, assim como eles foram responsáveis por um maior acúmulo de matéria orgânica, tendo então uma elevada demanda de cloro e uma maior influência na depreciação da qualidade da água fornecida às aves. Dos dois tipos de bebedouros estudados, o tipo nipple mostrou ser o menos deletério no que concerne à qualidade da água entretanto, independente do tipo de bebedouro utilizado na dessedentação das aves, a desinfecção da água é um ato imprescindível à manutenção de sua qualidade e à eliminação de futuros patógenos. The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the influence of two kinds of <b>water</b> <b>troughs</b> nipple and cup, used for laying hen water intake and the incresing demand of chlorine from the water offered by both kinds of <b>water</b> <b>troughs.</b> Total coliform, fecal coliform, Escherichia coli, fecal streptococci and mesophillic microorganisms bacterial count were done. Results showed that both, <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> and tank <b>water,</b> were microbiologycally contaminated before passing through the <b>water</b> <b>trough.</b> The contamination of fecal bacteria was greater in the cup <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> samples, as well as, they were the responsible for a greater organic material accumulation, that caused an elevated chlorine demand and greater depreciation in the water quality offered to the laying hens. From both <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> studied, nipple showed to be less harmful concerning water quality, however, independently of the kind of <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> used for the hen water ingestion, the water disinfection is indispensable to maintain the microbiological quality and to eliminate pathogens...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 2 feedlots in southern Alberta to identify environmental sources and management factors associated with the prevalence and transmission of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7. Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 was isolated in preslaughter pens of cattle from feces (0. 8 %), feedbunks (1. 7 %), <b>water</b> <b>troughs</b> (12 %), and incoming water supplies (4. 5 %), but not from fresh total mixed rations. Fresh total mixed rations did not support the growth of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and E. coli from bovine feces following experimental inoculation. Within a feedlot, the feces, <b>water</b> <b>troughs,</b> and feedbunks shared a few indistinguishable subtypes of E. coli O 157 :H 7. A few subtypes were repeatedly isolated in the same feedlot, and the 2 feedlots shared a few indistinguishable subtypes. The prevalence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in <b>water</b> <b>troughs</b> of preslaughter cattle in 1 feedlot was associated with season, maximum climatic temperatures the week before sampling; total precipitation the week before sampling, and coliform and E. coli counts in the <b>water</b> <b>trough...</b>|$|R

50|$|Depending on climate, barnyards {{may contain}} trees for shade. A water source is also common; the <b>watering</b> <b>trough</b> in past times was {{supplied}} by {{water from a}} hand driven well, with the water kept in wooden or metal containers. The <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> was filled daily, perhaps by a pitcher pump, or by windmill power. Pumping the trough full, by hand, was often the chore of farm children.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Two {{case studies}} were {{designed}} to {{study the effects of}} using off-stream water developments and water gap configurations to modify watering behavior of cattle. There were two objectives: 1) to evaluate an off-stream water source to reduce water quality impacts of grazing cattle on a mountain riparian zone during summer months; and 2) to evaluate water gaps {{to reduce the amount of}} manure being deposited in or within one meter of a stream. Installation of a <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> had a significant impact on cattle use of riparian areas. Use of a mountain stream and bottom area (spring) decreased after a <b>watering</b> <b>trough</b> adjacent to these areas was installed. Use of the stream dropped from 4. 7 to 0. 9 minutes per cow per day, and use of the bottom area dropped from 8. 3 to 3. 9 minutes per cow per day after the trough was installed. The <b>watering</b> <b>trough</b> offered a convenient and preferred water source over the traditional sources. In this case study, cattle <b>watered</b> at the <b>trough</b> 73. 5...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} appropriate alternatives {{for the provision of}} water to dairy cattle, the preference of dairy cows among three types of <b>water</b> <b>troughs</b> used in pasturebased systems was evaluated. The fi rst <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> was round, had a diameter of 120 cm, was 60 cm high and held 500 L (500 C); the second was a round <b>water</b> <b>trough,</b> 60 cm in diameter, 60 cm high, and held 125 L (125 C); the last trough was rectangular, 30 cm high and 100 cm long, and held 100 L (100 R). Individual preference tests were carried out with 17 dairy cows. The cows preferred to drink 67 % of the time from the 500 C trough, 18 % of the time from the 100 R trough, and 15 % of the time from the 125 C trough (p< 0. 001). Also, these animals drank more water (p< 0. 001), took more sips (p< 0. 001) and spent more time drinking (p< 0. 001) from the 500 C trough than from the other two troughs. When the 125 C and 100 R troughs were compared, no differences in the cows’ preferences were found. Considering the known effects of water consumption on dairy cow milk production, it was concluded that the <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> preferred by the cows should be recommended...|$|R

40|$|Five pens in 2 south east Queensland {{commercial}} feedlots (A and B) {{were used}} to determine relationships between climatic conditions and behavioural patterns of cattle. Standing or lying at the feed bunk or at the <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> were recorded from the 8 th January to the 27 th March. In Feedlot A, more cattle were standing when morning observations were used than in Feedlot B, while in Feedlot B there were more animals in standing behaviour during afternoon observation. Behavioural patterns such as standing at the feed bunk or standing at the <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> in Feedlot B were related to weather conditions. However, in Feedlot A, standing at the feed bunk did not show any relationship to weather conditions and the relationship between weather conditions and standing at the <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> was not as strong as in Feedlot B. Evaluation of behavioural patterns in a feedlot can be used as an aid to assess heat stress in feedlot cattle. However, this should be done on an individual feedlot basis...|$|R
