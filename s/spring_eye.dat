50|$|One of {{the spring}} eyes (Area 1) was first {{excavated}} by Ray Inskeep in 1963. This excavation was then extended and deepened by Hilary Deacon in 1964-66, who also excavated at a second <b>spring</b> <b>eye</b> at the site (Area 2). These excavations establishing thick, stratified Acheulean deposits in both spring eyes, something extremely rare in southern African contexts. The archaeology from these spring eyes are considered to represent late occurrences of the Acheulian, or perhaps even a rare occurrence in South Africa of Sangoan artefacts (Herries, 2011). Despite this fact the site has not been investigated in 50 years. In 2015 a joint research project involving La Trobe University, the University of Johannesburg, and University of Cape Town began at the site and has noted the first occurrence of Middle Stone Age artefacts at the site (Figure 3).|$|E

40|$|A four-leaf steel spring used in {{the rear}} {{suspension}} system of light vehicles is analyzed using ANSYS V 5. 4 software. The finite element results showing stresses and deflections verified the existing analytical and experimental solutions. Using {{the results of the}} steel leaf spring, a composite one made from fiberglass with epoxy resin is designed and optimized using ANSYS. Main conside-ration is given to the optimization of the spring geometry. The objective was to obtain a spring with minimum weight that is capable of carrying given static external forces without failure. The design constraints were stresses (Tsai–Wu failure criterion) and dis-placements. The results showed that an optimum spring width decreases hyperbolically and the thickness increases linearly from the <b>spring</b> <b>eyes</b> towards the axle seat. Compared to the steel spring, the optimized composite spring has stresses that are much lower, the natural frequency is higher and the <b>spring</b> weight without <b>eye</b> units is nearly 80 % lower...|$|R

50|$|Adonis vernalis, known {{variously}} as pheasant's <b>eye,</b> <b>spring</b> pheasant's <b>eye,</b> yellow pheasant's eye {{and false}} hellebore, is a perennial flowering {{plant in the}} buttercup family Ranunculaceae It is found in dry meadows and steppes in Eurasia. Isolated populations are found from Spain in the west across Central Europe with fine examples in Valais, Switzerland, and southern Europe, reaching southern Sweden {{in the north and}} Abruzzo in the south, with its main area of distribution being the Pannonian Basin and the West Siberian Plain. In contrast to most other European Adonis species, the flowers appear in springtime, and are up to 80 mm in diameter, with up to 20 bright yellow petals.|$|R

50|$|Multi-leaf springs {{are widely}} used for the {{suspension}} of cars, trucks and railway wagons. A multi-leaf spring consists {{of a series of}} flat plates, usually of semi-elliptical shape. The flat plates are called leaves of the spring.The leaf at the top has maximum length. The length gradually decreases from the top leaf to the bottom leaf. The longest leaf at the top is called master leaf. It is bent at both ends to form the <b>spring</b> <b>eyes.</b> Two bolts are inserted through these eyes to fix the leaf spring to the automobile body. The leaves are held together by means of two U-bolts and a center clip. Rebound clips are provided to keep the leaves in alignment and prevent lateral shifting of the leaves during operation. At the center, the leaf spring is supported on the axle. Multi-leaf springs are provided with one or two extra full-length leaves in addition to the master leaf and the graduated length leaves. The extra full-length leaves are provided to support the transverse sheer force.|$|R
