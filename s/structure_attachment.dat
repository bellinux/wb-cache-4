50|$|Chlorophyll a biosynthetic pathway {{utilizes}} {{a variety}} of enzymes. Genes code for the enzymes on the Mg-tetrapyrroles of both bacteriochlorophyll a and chlorophyll a. It begins with glutamic acid, which {{is transformed into a}} 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Two molecules of ALA are then reduced to porphobilinogen (PBG), and four molecules of PBG are then coupled, forming protoporphyrin IX. When forming protoporphyrin, Mg-chelatase acts as a catalyst for the insertion of Mg into the chlorophyll a structure. The pathway then uses either a light-dependent process, driven by the enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase. Protochlorophyllide is a precursor to the production of a chlorophyll a molecule, or a light-independent process driven by other enzymes, to form a cyclic ring, and the reduction of another ring in the <b>structure.</b> <b>Attachment</b> of the phytol tail completes the process of chlorophyll biosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|The {{cellulosome}} {{consists of}} a multi-functional integrating subunit (called scaffoldin), responsible for organizing the various cellulolytic subunits (e.g., the enzymes) into the complex. Within a cellulosome, multiple endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, xylanases and other degradative enzymes work synergistically to attack heterogeneous, insoluble cellulose substrates. This is accomplished by the interaction of two complementary classes of module, located on the two separate types of interacting subunits, i.e., a cohesin module on the scaffoldin and a dockerin module on each enzymatic subunit. The high-affinity cohesin-dockerin interaction defines the cellulosome <b>structure.</b> <b>Attachment</b> of the cellulosome to its substrate is mediated by a scaffoldin-borne cellulose-binding module (CBM) that comprises part of the scaffoldin subunit. Much of our understanding of its catalytic components, architecture, and mechanisms of attachment to the bacterial cell and to cellulose, has been derived {{from the study of}} Clostridium thermocellum.|$|E

40|$|Physical {{interactions}} between distinct chromosomal genomic loci {{are important for}} genomic functions including recombination and gene expression, but the mechanisms by which these interactions occur remain obscure. Using telomeric association as a model system, we analyzed here the in vivo organization of chromosome ends of haploid yeast cells during interphase. We separately labeled most of the 32 subtelomeres and analyzed their positions both in nuclear space and relative to three representative reference subtelomeres by high-throughput 3 D microscopy and image processing. We show that subtelomeres are positioned nonrandomly at the nuclear periphery, depending on the genomic size of their chromosome arm, centromere attachment to the microtubule organizing center (spindle pole body, SPB), and {{the volume of the}} nucleolus. The distance of subtelomeres to the SPB increases consistently with chromosome arm length up to ≈ 300 kb; for larger arms the influence of chromosome arm length is weaker, but the effect of the nucleolar volume is stronger. Distances between pairs of subtelomeres also exhibit arm-length dependence and suggest, together with dynamic tracking experiments, that potential associations between subtelomeres are unexpectedly infrequent and transient. Our results suggest that {{interactions between}} subtelomeres are nonspecific and instead governed by physical constraints, including chromosome <b>structure,</b> <b>attachment</b> to the SPB, and nuclear crowding...|$|E

Currently {{non-destructive}} testing techniques for composite aircraft structures are disadvantaged {{when compared to}} online Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems that monitor the structure while in-service and give real time data. The present research work looks at developing a protocol for online structural health monitoring of a UAV wing structure using PVDF film sensors, especially including the monitoring of structural changes caused by defects. Different types of SHM techniques were studied in relation to carbon fibre composites. Laminate composite make-up and manufacturing process was investigated and vacuum infusion process was used to manufacture the samples that resemble the Guardian II wing structure, then the three-point bending {{test was used to}} determine the material properties. Digital Shearography was employed as a stationery non-destructive technique to determine the sensor to <b>structure</b> <b>attachment,</b> type and position of defects that affect the state of performance. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was done using ANSYS Workbench which served as a modelling tool using a drawing imported from Solid-works.

40|$|The genomic {{sequence}} of Mycoplasma pneumoniae establish this cell-wall-less prokaryote {{as among the}} smallest known microorganisms capable of self-replication. However, this genomic simplicity and corresponding biosynthetic austerity are sharply contrasted by the complex terminal structure found in this species. This tip <b>structure</b> (<b>attachment</b> organelle) directs colonization of the human respiratory mucosa, leading to bronchitis and atypical pneumonia. Furthermore, formation of a second tip structure appears to precede cell division, implying temporal regulation. However, the organization, regulation, and assembly of the attachment organelle in M. pneumoniae are poorly understood, and no counterparts have been identified among the walled bacteria. M. pneumoniae possesses a cytoskeleton-like structure required to localize adhesin proteins to the attachment organelle. The cytadherence-associated proteins HMW 1, HMW 2, and HMW 3 are components of the mycoplasma cytoskeleton, with HMW 1 localizing strictly along the filamentous extensions from the cell body and HMW 3 being a key structural element of the terminal organelle. Disruptions in hmw 2 result {{in the loss of}} HMW 1 and HMW 3. However, the hmw 1 and hmw 3 genes were transcribed and translated at wild-type levels in hmw 2 mutants. HMW 1 and HMW 3 were relatively stable in the wild-type background over 8 h but disappeared in the mutants over this time period. Evaluation of recombinant HMW 1 levels in mycoplasma mutants suggested a requirement for the C-terminal domain of HMW 1 for turnover. Finally, an apparent defect in the processing of the precursor for the adhesin protein P 1 was noted in the HMW− mutants...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{structures}} are a conspicuous, yet poorly understood {{component of the}} marine environment along urban coastlines. Previous work has shown that different types of structures support different diversities and relative abundances of sessile marine organisms. Studies {{on the effects of}} substratum composition, age, orientation and the effects of predation have failed to explain the observed differences in assemblages that develop on different types of structures. We assessed the model that differences in epibiotic assemblages between pontoons and pilings were due to the floating nature of pontoons versus the fixed (relative to the seafloor) nature of pilings, as opposed to other structural differences (colour, shape, surface type, etc.). Two additional (nonmutually exclusive) models were also tested. These were that the presence of a ‘swash zone‘ constantly exposed to wave action and/or attachment to the benthos could cause differences between pontoons and pilings. We hypothesized that purpose-built experimental structures that floated would develop different assemblages from structures that were held fixed relative to the seafloor, regardless of whether they were pontoons or pilings. If swash were important, then structures floating just below the surface would differ from structures floating at the surface. If attachment to the benthos were important, then pilings attached to the benthos would differ from all the other structures. Multivariate analyses supported the hypothesis that both floating and the presence of swash were important in creating a typical pontoon assemblage, while other factors (type of <b>structure,</b> <b>attachment</b> to the benthos) were not. Several taxa contributed to these differences, including the mussel Mytilus edulis, the polychaete tubeworm Hydroides sp. and several algal taxa. Differences between fixed and floating structures have implications for the interpretation of previous studies done on floating docks. More studies of this kind are needed in order to inform the managers of urban waterways about the implications of adding different types of structures to the coastal environment. M. G.

40|$|This {{study used}} a mixed qualitative-quantitative design to {{describe}} attachment {{in a sample}} of one-hundred fifty-four healthy community-living older adults. Life-span development and attachment theory combined to define the philosophical and theoretical orientation that guided the investigation. The idea of an "attachment structure" was conceptualized by the investigator to frame attachment [...] an approach that allowed attachment to involve multiple attachment objects from any or all of six different attachment object types (things, ideas, people, groups of people, animals, or places). The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore and describe the <b>attachment</b> <b>structure</b> as it presented in, and developed in later life. In phase one of the study, 154 older adults were administered a questionnaire designed to elicit descriptive information about the newly conceptualized "attachment structure". This information was used to guide theoretical sampling in the qualitative, second phase. In phase two, a grounded theory methodology was used to explore the developmental changes that occurred in <b>attachment</b> <b>structures</b> in later life. Sixteen subjects from phase one were selected, based on their responses to the quantitative phase, as those subjects most likely to advance the theory developing focus of this study. Analysis supported the <b>attachment</b> <b>structure</b> as a meaningful representation of socio-emotional development in later life. The existence of multiple attachment objects of multiple object types was supported by both quantitative and qualitative data.

The Caenorhabditis elegans genome encodes multiple cIFs. The C. elegans ifb- 1 locus encodes two cIF isoforms, IFB- 1 A and IFB- 1 B, that differ in their head domains. We show that both IFB- 1 isoforms are expressed in epidermal cells, within which they are localized to muscle-epidermal <b>attachment</b> <b>structures.</b> Reduction in IFB- 1 A function by mutation or RNA interference (RNAi) causes epidermal fragility, abnormal epidermal morphogenesis, and muscle detachment, consistent with IFB- 1 A providing mechanical strength to epidermal <b>attachment</b> <b>structures.</b> Reduction in IFB- 1 B function causes morphogenetic defects and defective outgrowth of the excretory cell. Reduction in function of both IFB- 1 isoforms results in embryonic arrest due to muscle detachment and failure in epidermal cell elongation at the 2 -fold stage. Two other cIFs, IFA- 2 and IFA- 3, are expressed in epidermal cells. We show that loss of function in IFA- 3 results in defects in morphogenesis indistinguishable from those of embryos lacking ifb- 1. In contrast, IFA- 2 is not required for embryonic morphogenesis.
