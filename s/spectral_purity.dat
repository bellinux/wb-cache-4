Heralded single photons from parametric down-conversion can approximate on-demand single photons {{to a desired}} degree, with high <b>spectral</b> <b>purities</b> achieved through group-velocity matching and tailored crystal nonlinearities. Here we propose crystal nonlinearity engineering techniques with sub-coherence-length domains. We first introduce a combination of two existing methods: a deterministic approach with coherence-length domains and probabilistic domain-width annealing. We then show how the same deterministic domain-flip approach can be implemented with sub-coherence length domains. Both of these complementary techniques create highly pure photons, outperforming previous methods, in particular for short nonlinear crystals matched to femtosecond lasers.

These oscillators are not transportable at present and operate at a single frequency. To realize their full potential, a highly coherent, frequency-diverse fibre-optic network is needed to faithfully transfer the optical signals to remote sites and to different optical frequencies.

When comparing pSiMCs with different resonance wavelength position, luminescence was enhanced when the resonance wavelength overlapped with the maximum emission wavelength of the Eu(III) complex at 614 nm, allowing for effective coupling between the confined light and the emitting molecules. The pSiMC also improved the <b>spectral</b> color <b>purity</b> of the Eu(III) complex luminescence.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe application of resonance ionization mass spectroscopy (RIMS) to nuclear forensics {{involves the use}} of lasers to selectively ionize elements of concern. While current systems incorporate pulsed lasers for analysis of debris from nuclear detonation, the possibility exists to consider using continuous wave, or CW lasers RIMS has the potential to provide rapid quantification of isotope ratios of important elements in debris from nuclear detonation. The current approach to ionize uranium and plutonium uses three Ti-Sapphire pulsed lasers capable of a fundamental wavelength range of 700 – 1000 nm to perform ionization in three steps. This thesis evaluates the use of COTS CW laser to replace one of the pulsed lasers exciting the second resonance step of plutonium near 847. 282 nm. The thesis research consists of three elements: (1) completion of an initial feasibility study to determine the viability of the COTS CW alternative, (2) identification and acquisition of a candidate COTS laser, and (3) testing to evaluate the critical laser parameters necessary to achieve high precision isotope ratio measurements including the stability over time of the mean wavelength, bandwidth and <b>spectral</b> mode <b>purity.</b> This narrower bandwidth COTS CW laser may enable simpler operations, greater robustness and better utilization of the available laser irradiance.

40|$|Chromatic {{luminance}} (i. e., luminance of a monochromatic color) is {{the source}} of all luminance, since achromatic luminance arises only from mixing colors and their chromatic luminances. The ratio of chromatic luminance to total luminance (i. e., chromatic plus achromatic luminance) is known as colorimetric purity, and its measurement has long been problematic for nonspectral hues. Colorimetric purity (pc) is a luminance metric in contrast to excitation purity, which is a chromaticity-diagram metric approximating saturation. The CIE definition of pc contains a fallacy. CIE defines maximum (1. 0) pc for spectral stimuli as monochromatic (i. e., optimal) stimuli, and as the line between spectrum ends for nonspectrals. However, this line has < 0. 003 lm/W according to CIE colorimetric data and is therefore effectively invisible. It only represents the limit of theoretically attainable colors, and is of no practical use in color reproduction or color appearance. Required is a locus giving optimal rather than invisible nonspectral stimuli. The problem is partly semantic. CIE wisely adopted the term colorimetric purity, rather than the original <b>spectral</b> luminance <b>purity,</b> to permit an equivalent metric for spectrals and nonspectrals, but the parameter of equivalence was never clear. Since 1 pc denotes optimal aperture-color stimuli for spectrals, arguably 1 pc should denote optimal stimuli consistently for all stimuli. The problem reduces to calculating optimal aperture-color stimuli ("optimal" in energy efficiency in color-matching) for nonspectrals, shown to comprise 442 + 613 nm in all CIE illuminants. This remedy merely requires redefinition of 1 pc for nonspectrals as the line 442 - 613 nm, and gives meaningful pc values over the hue cycle allowing new research of chromatic luminance relations with color appearance. 8 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Male C. eurytheme hindwings {{demonstrate}} an ultraviolet {{reflectance pattern}} while female C. eurytheme hindwings demonstrate ultraviolet absorbing patterns. According to studies, these ultraviolet reflecting wing scales found in males also contain pterin pigments that absorb wavelengths below 550 nm. Although {{this may seem}} paradoxical, the pterin pigments {{have been found to}} decrease the amount of diffuse ultraviolet reflectance that comes from the wing scales. By suppressing the diffuse ultraviolet reflectance, the directionality and <b>spectral</b> <b>purity</b> of the iridescence is heightened. In addition, the presence of the pterin pigments increases the signal's chromaticity and potential signal content, suggesting that these pigments are responsible for amplifying the contrast between ultraviolet reflectance and background colors as a male's wings move during flight. Further studies have found that the ultraviolet reflectance signal is brightest within a wing beat cycle when viewed from directly above the male. This supports the idea that male wing color should be able to be readily distinguished from that of females and the visual background that consists mostly of UV-absorbing vegetation.|$|E
50|$|While {{the concept}} is simple, there is a key {{difficulty}} that must be overcome by any implementation: how to generate a rainbow of spread optical frequencies whose bandwidth of difference frequencies {{with respect to the}} detector is less than the electrical bandwidth of the detector. That is to say, a typical detector might have a bandwidth on the scale of 100Megahertz. If the biggest difference frequency is |ω6-ω6| then this difference need to be smaller than 100 Megahertz. This in turn means the spacing between the adjacent difference frequencies must be less than 100Mhz and on average less than 100Mhz/number of pixels. To see why this presents a problem consider dispersing white light with a prism. For any finite size prism you cannot get enough dispersion to create resolved (non-overlapping beamlets) that differ by less than a megahertz. Thus dispersion methods cannot disperse a broadband light source to create the frequency shifted beamlets with narrowly spaced difference frequencies, One possible way to achieve this is to have a separate laser source for every beamlet; these sources must be precisely frequency controlled so their center frequencies are separated by the desired shifts. The primary problem with this is practical: The bandwidth and frequency drift of most lasers is much greater than 1 Mhtz. The lasers needed for this must be of sufficiently narrow <b>spectral</b> <b>purity</b> that they can interfere coherently with the signal source. Even so, having multiple narrow band precision frequency-tuned lasers is also complex.|$|E

We present a design scheme for monolithically integrated resonant photon-pair sources based on parametric down-conversion in nonlinear waveguides, which facilitate the generation of such photons. We investigate the impact of different design parameters on the performance of our source. The generated photon spectral bandwidths can be varied between several tens of MHz up to around 1 GHz, facilitating an efficient coupling to different memories. The central frequency of the generated photons can be coarsely tuned by adjusting the pump frequency, poling period and sample temperature and we identify stability requirements on the pump laser and sample temperature that can be readily fulfilled with off-the-shelve components. We find that our source is capable of generating high-purity photons over a wide range of photon bandwidths. Finally, the PDC emission can be frequency fine-tuned over several GHz by simultaneously adjusting the sample temperature and pump frequency. We conclude our study with demonstrating the adaptability of our source to different quantum memories. Comment: 10 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous {{parametric}} down-conversion (SPDC) is {{a reliable}} and robust source of photons for quantum information applications.

We report the design and experimental characterization of an SPDC source that has been optimized for high <b>spectral</b> and spatial <b>purity.</b> The source is pumped by the 776 nm output of a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser and consists of a periodically-poled Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (PPKTP) crystal phase-matched for collinear type-II SPDC. The dispersive properties of PPKTP at these wavelengths is such {{that it is possible}} to minimize the spectral entanglement by matching the widths of the pump to the spectral phase-matching function. The spatial entanglement is minimized through careful control of the pump focus, yielding nearly single-mode emission. An advantage of this approach is that the emission rate into the collection modes is very high, resulting in a very bright SPDC source. We also report a scheme that employs the output of collinear sources such as these to produce polarization-entangled photon pairs. The scheme, which requires only simple polarization elements, can be scaled to N-photon GHZ states...|$|R
40|$|The Pixel Purity Index (PPI) {{algorithm}} {{is used as}} a pre-processing to find end-members in a hyper spectral image. It tries to identify pure spectra by assigning a pixel purity index to each pixel in the image. The algorithm proceeds by generating a large number of random vectors through the hyper spectral image and by computing a dot-product between each vector and all the pixels. Since the number of random vectors is high (a few thousands), this algorithm may require hours of computation on standard computers. We present a systolic implementation of the PPI algorithm. It is based on a linear systolic array connected to a host processor through its external I/O bus system. In this scheme, the image is stored on the host processor memory and flushed several times through the array. The performance is mainly dictated by the I/O bus bandwidth and the ability to implement large systolic arrays: the fewer the passes needed through the array, the better the performance. The hardware implementation targets Xilinx Virtex boards, but the specification is independent of the platform: no external memories are required and the architecture works whatever the size of the linear systolic array. Experiments carried out on a low-cost reconfigurable board (a single Xilinx Virtex 800) show a speed-up of two orders of magnitude compared to a software implementation.
