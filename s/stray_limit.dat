40|$|Graduation date: 1985 An {{instrument}} was constructed to measure molecular fluorescence (FL) or chemiluminescence (CL) and absorbance (ABS) simultaneously. The lower, middle, and upper {{portions of the}} test solution are probed to obtain ABS, FL, and CL data. Optical fibers are used extensively. The ABS and FL or CL spectra are acquired in 400 ms or more with diode array detectors mounted on spectrographs. The FL and CL signals can also be detected with photomultiplier tubes after wavelength selection with filters and/or a monochromator. Two microcomputers in a master- slave arrangement control data acquisition. The performance of the multiple signal spectrometer was evaluated using quinine sulfate (QS) solutions and the CL reactions of lucigenin (Lc) and luminol. Chemiluminescence and FL signals which cannot be spectrally resolved are measured sequentially by blocking the FL excitation (EX) beam. Absorbance can be measured from 300 to 800 nm. Noise and <b>stray</b> light <b>limit</b> accuracy above 1. 5 A. U. The EL detection limit for QS ranges from 1. 2 to 40 pg/mL, depending on the detection scheme. Software was developed to utilize the measured ABS in appropriate equations to automatically correct the luminescence signals for attenuation (inner-filter effects) caused by absorption of the EX or emission (EM) radiation by the lumophore or other species. Pre- viously developed correction equations were modified for situations in which the EX or EM beam cannot {{be considered to be}} monochromatic and for collection geometries involving optical fibers. The correction scheme was tested in the absence and presence of chromophores (gentisic acid, methyl red, K₂Cr₂O₇). Even when conditions are such that the FL signal is attenuated by a factor of 10, the correction scheme is accurate to 2 % or better. These corrections extend the linear range of the QS calibration curve by a factor of over 100. Finally, the kinetics of the reaction of Lc with H₂O₂ in the presence of KOH were studied. Time resolved ABS, FL, and CL spectra were obtained. Although some of the spectral shifts occurring during the reaction are due to changing inner-filter effects, the corrected spectra demonstrate that methyl acridone is not the species respon- sible for CL, as some researchers claim...|$|R

This work presents full-Stokes measurements of the full-split (g = 3) line Fe I 1564. 85 nm with spatial resolution of 0. 5 " obtained with the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph in three large sunspots. The continuum intensity is corrected for instrumental scattered light and the brightness temperature is calculated. Magnetic field strength and inclination are derived directly from the line split and the ratio of Stokes components. The continuum intensity (temperature) relations to the field strength are studied separately in the umbra, light bridges, and penumbra. The {{results are consistent with}} previous studies and {{it was found that the}} scatter of values in the relations increases with increasing spatial resolution thanks to resolved fine structures. The observed relations show trends common for the umbra, light bridges, and the inner penumbra, while the outer penumbra has a weaker magnetic field compared to the inner penumbra at equal continuum intensities. This fact can be interpreted in terms of the interlocking comb magnetic structure of the penumbra. A comparison with data obtained from numerical simulations was made.

40|$|Program/Poster no. 870. 6 /C 12 To {{determine}} if chondroitin sulfates (CS) contribute restrictive guidance in commissural projections from the vestibular nucleus, we treated embryos (E 12. 5 - 14. 5, Sprague-Dawley rats) with chondroitinase ABC or vehicle via the fourth ventricle for 24 hrs in culture and then tracked projections following DiI injection into the vestibular nucleus on one side. After 1 day in vitro (DIV), control treatment resulted in projections that {{were similar to}} those that developed in vivo. The projections remained fasciculated as they approached the midline (E 12. 5 + 1 DIV), crossed the floor plate (E 13. 5 + 1 DIV), and reached the contralateral nucleus (E 14. 5 + 1 DIV). In enzyme- treated embryos, unfasciculated projections diverted from the course of the fasciculated pioneer-projections. To {{determine if}} the restrictive guidance is due to modulations in sulfation of chondroitins, we determined the mRNA expression profiles of chondroitin sulfotransferases in the hindbrains of E 11. 5 -E 16. 5 embryos. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR indicated increasing expression as from E 11. 5 and by E 13. 5 - 14. 5, peaking of the 6 -sulfotransferase mRNA, leveled basal expression of the 4 -sulfotransferase- 1 mRNA and progressively rising 4 -sulfotransferase- 2 mRNA were observed.

The Yarmirr decision also established that non-exclusive offshore native title rights must be consistent with the public right. This creates the potential for litigation where it is asserted that actions of native title holders have infringed the public right or where recreational anglers purportedly exercising the public right in an area subject to a native title determination <b>stray</b> beyond the <b>limits</b> of the right. The public right to fish also continues despite exclusive indigenous ownership rights over the foreshore (to the low water mark) where ownership rights exist under legislative land grants.

Further, far from being regulated out of existence, in some jurisdictions the public right to fish has been enshrined in legislation.

This paper examines the content of the public right to fish and assesses its enduring significance in light of Yarmirr and post-Yarmirr offshore native title determina-tions.

40|$|The {{spectrum}} of conventional power electronics packaging reaches from SMD packages for power chips to large power modules. In {{most of these}} packages the power semiconductors are connected by bond wires, resulting in large resistances and parasitic inductances. Power chip packages have to carry semiconductors with increasing current densities. Conventional wire bonds are limiting their performance. Today's power modules are based on DCB (Direct Copper bonded) ceramic substrates. IGBT switches are mounted onto the ceramic and their top side contacts are connected by thick Al wires. This allows one wiring layer only and makes an integration of driver chips very difficult. Additionally, bond wires result in a high <b>stray</b> inductance which <b>limits</b> the switching frequency. Especially {{for the use of}} ultra-fast switching semiconductors, like SiC and GaN, {{it is very difficult to}} realize low inductive packages. A new approach for embedded power modules will be presented, which can cover different application fields, ranging from 50 W over 500 W to 50 kW power modules for different applications like single chip packages, over power control units for pedelec (Pedal Electric Cycle), to inverter modules for automotive applications. This approach will focus on a power core base structure for with embedded semiconductors, which is then connected to a high power PCB. The connection to the embedded die is realized by a direct copper connection only. The technology principle will be described in detail. The embedding of chips offers a solution for many of the problems in power chip packages and power modules. While chip embedding was an academic exercise a decade ago, it is now an industrial solution [1]. A huge advantage of packaging using PCB technology is the cost-effective processing on large panel.

The developing hindbrain {{was found to be}} enriched in 6 -sulfated isoforms of chondroitin as early as E 8. 5 – 9. 5 in the mouse; expression levels decreased to undetectable levels in the following two days. To assess if chondroitin sulfates (CS) play a part in determining axonal projections about this period in the early embryonic hindbrain, chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) was delivered into the 4 th ventricles of rat embryos (E 11. 5 – 13. 5) in culture to digest away CS moieties in the nearby hindbrain matrix. Controls received either vehicle or the heat-inactivated enzyme instead. DiI injection was introduced into the vestibular nuclear complex (VNC) near the VIIIth cranial nerve entry zone to map the commissural projections that developed during the treatments. At E 11. 5 (+ 1 DIV), few neuritis extended towards the midline in cases of PBS and heatinactivated ChABC. In contrast, with digestion of CSs, robust projections reached the dye-injection site from regions half-way towards the midline. This suggests that CSs limit projection across the hindbrain matrix of early embryos. At E 12. 5 (+ 1 DIV), the contralateral-projecting axons assumed fascicles bearing tapered terminals that reached the midline in the controls. In the enzymetreated embryos, the axons however remained unfasciculated as they extended normal to the midline. By E 13. 5 (+ 1 DIV), enzyme treatment apparently did not affect the pioneer axons that had advanced normal to the midline and beyond towards the contralateral VNC. However, later axonal outgrowths from the VNC traversed the enzyme-treated matrix as unfasciculated fibres and diverted from the course of the pioneers to cross the midline at various angles and positions along the midline. This suggests that CSs also limit the course of the later projections which otherwise would be attracted to alternative targets.

There was a certain king called Hkrikros, who had a fearful temper and no immediate successor in his own family; his married sister, however, had provided him with a large stock of nephews from which to select his heir. And the most eligible and royally-approved of all these nephews was the sixteen-year-old Vespaluus.

Now Hkrikros was a Pagan of the first water, and kept the worship of the sacred serpents, who lived in a hallowed grove on a hill near the royal palace, up to a high pitch of enthusiasm. The common people were allowed to please themselves, within certain discreet limits, in the matter of private religion, but any official {{in the service of the}} Court who went over to the new cult was looked down on, literally as well as metaphorically, the looking down being done from the gallery that ran round the royal bear-pit. Consequently there was considerable scandal and consternation when the youthful Vespaluus appeared one day at a Court function with a rosary tucked into his belt, and announced in reply to angry questionings that he had decided to adopt Christianity, or at any rate to give it a trial. If it had been any of the other nephews the king would possibly have ordered something drastic in the way of scourging and banishment, but in the case of the favoured Vespaluus he determined to look on the whole thing much as a modern father might regard the announced intention of his son to adopt the stage as a profession.

[...] Not thus the land appeared in ages past, [...] A dreary desert and a gloomy waste,[17] [...] To savage beasts and savage laws a prey,[18] [...] 45 [...] And kings more furious and severe than they;[19] [...] Who claimed the skies, dispeopled air and floods, [...] The lonely lords of empty wilds and woods:[20] [...] Cities laid waste, they stormed the dens and caves, [...] (For wiser brutes were backward to be slaves.)[21] [...] 50 [...] What could be free, when lawless beasts obeyed,[22] [...] And ev'n the elements[23] a tyrant swayed? [...] In vain kind seasons swelled the teeming grain, [...] Soft show'rs distilled, and suns grew warm in vain; [...] The swain with tears his frustrate labour yields,[24] [...] 55 [...] And famished dies amidst his ripened fields.[25] [...] What wonder then, a beast or subject slain[26] [...] Were equal crimes in a despotic reign? [...] Both doomed alike, for sportive tyrants bled, [...] But while the subject starved, the beast was fed. [...] 60 [...] Proud Nimrod first the bloody chace began, [...] A mighty hunter, and his prey was man: [...] Our haughty Norman boasts that barb'rous name, [...] And makes his trembling slaves the royal game. [...] The fields are ravished from th' industrious swains, [...] 65 [...] From men their cities, and from gods their fanes:[27] [...] The levelled towns[28] with weeds lie covered o'er;[29] [...] The hollow winds through naked temples roar;[30] [...] Round broken columns clasping ivy twined; [...] O'er heaps of ruin stalked the stately hind;[31] [...] 70 [...] The fox obscene to gaping tombs retires, [...] And savage howlings[32] fill the sacred choirs.[33] [...] Awed by his nobles, by his commons curst, [...] Th' oppressor ruled tyrannic where he durst,[34] [...] Stretched o'er the poor and church his iron rod, [...] 75 [...] And served alike his vassals and his God.[35] [...] Whom ev'n the Saxon spared, and bloody Dane, [...] The wanton victims of his sport remain. [...] But see, the man, who spacious regions gave [...] A waste for beasts, himself denied a grave![36] [...] 80 [...] Stretched on the lawn[37] his second hope survey,[38] [...] At once the chaser, and at once the prey:[39] [...] Lo Rufus, tugging at the deadly dart, [...] Bleeds in the forest like a wounded hart.[40] [...] Succeeding monarchs heard the subject's cries, [...] 85 [...] Nor saw displeased the peaceful cottage rise.[41] [...] Then gath'ring flocks on unknown[42] mountains fed, [...] O'er sandy wilds were yellow harvests spread, [...] The forest wondered at th' unusual grain,[43] [...] And secret transport touched the conscious swain.[44] [...] 90 [...] Fair Liberty, Britannia's goddess, rears [...] Her cheerful head, and leads the golden years.[45] [...] Ye vig'rous swains! while youth ferments your blood, [...] And purer spirits swell the sprightly flood,[46] [...] 95 [...] Now range the hills, the gameful[47] woods beset, [...] Wind the shrill horn, or spread the waving net. [...] When milder autumn summer's heat succeeds,[48] [...] And in the new-shorn field the partridge feeds, [...] Before his lord the ready spaniel bounds, [...] Panting with hope, he tries the furrowed grounds; [...] 100 [...] But when the tainted gales the game betray, [...] Couched close he lies, and meditates the prey;[49] [...] Secure they trust th' unfaithful field beset, [...] Till hov'ring o'er them sweeps the swelling net. [...] Thus (if small things we may with great compare)[50] [...] 105 [...] When Albion sends her eager sons to war, [...] Some thoughtless town, with ease and plenty blest,[51] [...] Near, and more near, the closing lines invest; [...] Sudden they seize th' amazed, defenceless prize, [...] And high in air Britannia's standard flies. [...] 110 [...] See! from the brake the whirring pheasant springs, [...] And mounts exulting on triumphant wings:[52] [...] Short is his joy; he feels the fiery wound, [...] Flutters in blood, and panting beats the ground. [...] Ah! what avail his glossy, varying dyes,[53] [...] 115 [...] His purple crest, and scarlet-circled eyes, [...] The vivid green his shining plumes unfold, [...] His painted wings,[54] and breast that flames with gold? [...] Nor yet, when moist Arcturus clouds the sky, [...] The woods and fields their pleasing toils deny.[55] [...] 120 [...] To plains with well-breathed beagles we repair, [...] And trace the mazes of the circling hare: [...] Beasts, urged by us, their fellow-beasts pursue, [...] And learn of man each other to undo.[56] [...] With slaught'ring guns th' unwearied fowler roves, [...] 125 [...] When frosts have whitened all the naked groves;[57] [...] Where doves in flocks the leafless trees o'ershade,[58] [...] And lonely woodcocks haunt the wat'ry glade. [...] He lifts the tube, and levels with his eye;[59] [...] Straight a short thunder breaks the frozen sky: [...] 130 [...] Oft, as in airy rings they skim the heath, [...] The clam'rous lapwings feel the leaden death: [...] Oft, as the mounting larks their notes prepare, [...] They fall, and leave their little lives in air.[60] [...] In genial spring, beneath the quiv'ring shade, [...] 135 [...] Where cooling vapours breathe along the mead, [...] The patient fisher takes his silent stand, [...] Intent, his angle trembling in his hand:[61] [...] With looks unmoved, he hopes[62] the scaly breed, [...] And eyes the dancing cork, and bending reed. [...] 140 [...] Our plenteous streams a various race supply, [...] The bright-eyed perch with fins of Tyrian dye, [...] The silver eel, in shining volumes[63] rolled, [...] The yellow carp, in scales bedropped with gold,[64] [...] Swift trouts, diversified with crimson stains, [...] 145 [...] And pikes, the tyrants of the wat'ry plains.[65] [...] Now Cancer glows with Phoebus' fiery car:[66] [...] The youth rush eager to the sylvan war,[67] [...] Swarm o'er the lawns, the forest walks surround, [...] Rouse the fleet hart, and cheer the opening hound. [...] 150 [...] Th' impatient courser pants in ev'ry vein, [...] And pawing, seems to beat the distant plain. [...] Hills, vales, and floods appear already crossed, [...] And ere he starts, a thousand steps are lost.[68] [...] See the bold youth strain up the threat'ning[69] steep, [...] 155 [...] Rush through the thickets, down the valleys sweep, [...] Hang o'er their coursers' heads with eager speed, [...] And earth rolls back beneath the flying steed.[70] [...] Let old Arcadia boast her ample plain, [...] Th' immortal huntress, and her virgin-train; [...] 160 [...] Nor envy, Windsor! since thy shades have seen [...] As bright a goddess, and as chaste a queen;[71] [...] Whose care, like hers, protects the sylvan reign,[72] [...] The earth's fair light, and empress of the main.[73] [...] Here too, 'tis sung, of old Diana strayed, [...] 165 [...] And Cynthus' top forsook for Windsor shade: [...] Here was she seen o'er airy wastes to rove, [...] Seek the clear spring, or haunt the pathless grove;[74] [...] Here armed with silver bows, in early dawn, [...] Her buskined virgins traced the dewy lawn. [...] 170 [...] Above the rest a rural nymph was famed,[75] [...] Thy offspring, Thames! the fair Lodona named; [...] (Lodona's fate, in long oblivion cast, [...] The muse shall sing, and what she sings shall last.) [...] Scarce could the goddess from her nymph be known, [...] 175 [...] But by the crescent and the golden zone.[76] [...] She scorned the praise of beauty, and the care; [...] A belt her waist, a fillet binds her hair;[77] [...] A painted quiver on her shoulder sounds,[78] [...] And with her dart the flying deer she wounds. [...] 180 [...] It chanced, as eager of the chace, the maid [...] Beyond the forest's verdant <b>limits</b> <b>strayed,</b> [...]|$|R
