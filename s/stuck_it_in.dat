500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{many of the}} scenes in [...] "The Reporter" [...] were improvised by the actors. For example, Chris Pratt changed the {{original}} line about Mark, [...] "He's thinking with his wiener instead of his brain," [...] to [...] "He's thinking {{with the head of}} his wiener, instead of the head of his brain." [...] Aziz Ansari also improvised the line about Mark, [...] "That dude has <b>stuck</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> some crazy chicks." [...] Schur was surprised NBC censors allowed either of the lines to stay in the episode. The clip of Leslie trying to confront a raccoon loose in the city hall building was originally filmed for a Parks and Recreation commercial, but was later included into this episode. The scene was filmed to establish a running gag that Pawnee has a terrible raccoon infestation problem. The J.J.'s Diner eatery featured in the episode was named after Goor's wife. Poehler speedily eats tremendous amounts of whipped cream on her waffles. This was inspired by Parks and Recreation story editor Rachel Axler, who producer Morgan Sackett said is [...] "a tiny, bird-like woman" [...] who eats enormous amounts of whipped cream.|$|E
500|$|By early 1975, Nixon's {{health was}} improving. He {{maintained}} {{an office in}} a Coast Guard station 300 yards from his home, at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day; he mainly worked on his memoirs. He had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs; {{the fact that his}} assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly. He was handicapped in this work {{by the end of his}} transition allowance in February, which compelled him to part with many of his staff, including Ziegler. In August of that year, he met with British talk-show host and producer David Frost, who paid him $600,000 (...) for a series of sit-down interviews, filmed and aired in 1977. They began on the topic of foreign policy, recounting the leaders he had known, but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate. Nixon admitted that he had [...] "let down the country" [...] and that [...] "I brought myself down. I gave them a sword and they <b>stuck</b> <b>it</b> <b>in.</b> And they twisted it with relish. And, I guess, if I'd been in their position, I'd have done the same thing." [...] The interviews garnered 45–50million viewers—becoming the most-watched program of their kind in television history.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 May 1985, Đorđe Martinović, a 56-year-old {{resident}} of the Kosovo town of Gnjilane, arrived at the local hospital with a broken bottle wedged in his rectum. He claimed {{that he had been}} attacked by two Albanian-speaking men while he was working in his field. After being interviewed by a Yugoslav People's Army colonel, Martinović reportedly admitted that his injuries had been self-inflicted in a botched attempt at masturbation. Public investigators reported that [...] "the prosecutor made a written conclusion from which it appears that the wounded performed an act of 'self-satisfaction' in his field, [...] put a beer bottle on a wooden stick and <b>stuck</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the ground. After that he sat 'on the bottle and enjoyed'." [...] Community leaders in Gnjilane subsequently issued a statement describing his injuries as the [...] "accidental consequences of a self-induced [...] practice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lennon, being {{mindful of}} Elvis Presley's [...] "All Shook Up", wanted {{something}} equally as stirring: [...] "I don't {{know where the}} 'yeah yeah yeah' came from [...] I remember when Elvis did 'All Shook Up' {{it was the first}} time in my life that I had heard 'uh huh', 'oh yeah', and 'yeah yeah' all sung in the same song". The song also included a number of falsetto [...] "wooooo"'s, which Lennon acknowledged as being inspired by the Isley Brothers' recording of [...] "Twist and Shout", which the Beatles had earlier recorded, and which had also been inserted into the group's previous single, [...] "From Me to You". As Lennon later said: [...] "We <b>stuck</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> everything". McCartney recalls them playing the finished song on acoustic guitars to his father Jim at home immediately after the song was completed: [...] "We went into the living room and said 'Dad, listen to this. What do you think? And he said 'That's very nice son, but there's enough of these Americanisms around. Couldn't you sing 'She loves you, yes, yes, yes!'. At which point we collapsed in a heap and said 'No, Dad, you don't quite get it!'". EMI recording engineer Norman Smith had a somewhat similar reaction, later recounting, [...] "I was setting up the microphone when I first saw the lyrics on the music stand, 'She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah!' I thought, Oh my God, what a lyric! This is going to be one that I do not like. But when they started to sing it—bang, wow, terrific, I was up at the mixer jogging around." ...|$|E
