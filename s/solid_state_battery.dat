40|$|Currently, {{automotive}} batteries use intercalation cathodes such as lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4) {{which provide}} {{high levels of}} safety while sacrificing cell voltage and therefore energy density. Lithium transition metal oxide (LiMO 2) batteries achieve higher cell voltages {{at the risk of}} releasing oxygen gas during charging, which can lead to ignition of the liquid electrolyte. To achieve both safety and high energy density, oxide cathodes must be well characterized under operating conditions. In any intercalation cathode material, the loss of positive lithium ions during charge must be balanced by the loss of negative electrons from the host material. Ideally, the TM ions oxidize to compensate this charge. Alarmingly, the stoichiometry of the latest LiMO 2 cathode materials includes more lithium ions than the TM ions can compensate for. Inevitably, peroxide ions or dioxygen gas must form. The former mechanism is vital for lithium-air batteries, while the latter must be avoided.

The reaction between lithium tert-butoxide (LiO^tBu) and diethyl phosphoramidate (DEPA) produces conformal, ionically conductive thin films with a stoichiometry close to Li_ 2 PO_ 2 N between 250 and 300 ^∘C. The P/N ratio of the films is always 1, indicative of a particular polymorph of LiPON which closely resembles a polyphosphazene. Films grown at 300 ^∘C have an ionic conductivity of 6. 51 (± 0. 36) × 10 ^- 7 S/cm at 35 ^∘C, and are functionally electrochemically stable in the window from 0 to 5. 3 V vs. Li/Li^+.
