5|$|Due to his partial {{defense of}} Khrushchev during his ouster, Mikoyan lost his high <b>standing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new Soviet leadership. The Politburo forced Mikoyan {{to retire from}} his seat in the Politburo due to old age. Mikoyan quickly also lost his post as head of state and was succeeded in this post by Nikolai Podgorny on 9 December 1965. Brezhnev officialised Mikoyan's {{retirement}} by awarding him an Order of Lenin.|$|E
5|$|King Stephen sent Hilary {{to attend}} a church council at Reims in 1148 along with Robert de Bethune, who was the Bishop of Hereford, and William de Turbeville. Theobald of Bec was also present, even though the king had {{forbidden}} him to attend. The medieval chronicler Gervase of Canterbury stated that Stephen wanted to weaken Theobald's <b>standing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> papacy, but Stephen also would have wished to assert his authority over the English Church by insisting {{on the right to}} limit papal contact with the English bishops, something that his predecessors had always done.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} battle, Tissaphernes {{had arrived in}} the Hellespont and Alcibiades left the fleet at Sestos to meet him, {{bringing}} gifts and hoping to once again try to win over the Persian governor. Evidently Alcibiades had gravely misjudged his <b>standing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> satrap, and he was arrested on arrival. Within a month he would escape and resume command. It was now obvious, however, that he had no influence with the Persians; from now on his authority would depend on what he actually could accomplish rather than on what he promised to do.|$|E

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the President does not stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E
5|$|Tracy {{was absent}} from screens {{for almost a}} year before {{returning}} to Twentieth Century-Fox on loan and appearing as Henry M. Stanley in Stanley and Livingstone, his only film of 1939.

In October of that year, a Fortune magazine survey to find the nation's favorite movie actor listed Tracy in first place.|$|E
5|$|Gadret rode {{both the}} Giro and the Tour in 2010, an {{arrangement}} {{which resulted in}} some controversy when he refused to grant Roche, the squad's leader for the race, his wheel after the Irishman had punctured at a particularly inopportune time. This coupled with Gadret's recuperation after the extremely difficult Giro, and his admission that he prefers the Italian Grand Tour in any event, led to speculation {{as to whether the}} two would both be named to the squad. He claimed he would ride only to support Roche, if he rode at all. Lavenu stated that Gadret's impressive Giro had grown his <b>standing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team, and that the feud between him and Roche had been forgotten, so he hoped Gadret would ride the Tour. Confident of his recovery abilities, Gadret did indeed start the Tour.|$|E

Returning home, Scully finds Skinner leaving her apartment and driving off; he later denies being there. Mulder, recovered from the Blessing Way ritual, is told by Albert that he cannot bathe or change clothes for four days. Scully heads to Boston to attend Bill's funeral, where she introduces herself to Mulder's mother, Teena. At the cemetery, Scully is approached by a Syndicate member known as the Well-Manicured Man, who warns her that {{she is about to}} be killed, either by a pair of assassins or by someone she knows. Mulder goes to Massachusetts and questions Teena about an old photo of his father <b>standing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other members of the Syndicate in front of a mysterious building.|$|E
5|$|Stela 5 was {{situated}} {{at the base of}} Structure 1 in the East Plaza. It was carved with a rounded frame containing a figure in profile facing to the left. The figure is <b>standing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> legs together and is wearing a feathered headdress and bears a zoomorphic head on its back, from which hang more feathers. The hands of the figure are extended forward and appear to bear a staff of rulership. The stela bears a hieroglyphic panel with an incomplete dedicatory date that must fall within the range from December 740 to November 805. The text also contains the name of the king who dedicated the stela, Shield Jaguar, and the Emblem Glyph of El Chal.|$|E
5|$|The Chetniks {{addressed}} a crowd in Trebinje, announcing {{that they had}} cells in every village in eastern Herzegovina, and were establishing a Greater Serbia. Only five days after Baćović's appointment, {{the commander of the}} Mountain Staff of the Bosnian Chetnik Detachments, Stevan Botić, demanded Baćović be replaced. Botić had appointed himself as commander of the Mountain Staff after the previous commander, Jezdimir Dangić had been arrested in Belgrade in April 1942. Botić and his allies opposed Mihailović's control because they favoured a political rather than strictly military organisation, wanted to continue the alliance with the Nedić regime that Dangić had forged, and opposed the control of Bosnian Chetniks by non-Bosnians. Botić also wanted to remain independent of Mihailović so that he could freely kill Muslims and Bosnian Croats without damaging Mihailović's <b>standing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Serb people through close association with Botić's activities. Soon after the conference, both Baćović and Trifunović-Birčanin were negotiating with Italian VI Corps and XVIII Corps headquarters staff regarding the proposed offensive against the Partisans in western Bosnia.|$|E

5|$|Unlike oratorios or operas, {{which are}} {{generally}} structured dramaturgically into arias, recitatives and choruses, a choral symphony is structured like a symphony, in movements. It may employ the traditional four-movement scheme of a fast opening movement, slow movement, scherzo and finale, or {{as with many}} instrumental symphonies, it may use a different structure of movements. The written text in a choral symphony shares equal <b>standing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> music, as in an oratorio, and the chorus and soloists share equality with the instruments. Over time the use of text allowed the choral symphony to evolve from an instrumental symphony with a choral finale, as in the Beethoven's Ninth, to a composition that can use voices and instruments throughout the entire composition, as in Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms or Mahler's Eighth Symphony.|$|E
5|$|What {{was seen}} as a failure to keep {{discipline}} on the team hurt Stengel's <b>standing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Yankee owners, Topping, Weiss and Webb, as did the defeat in the 1957 Series. Stengel was by then aged 67, had several times fallen asleep in the dugout, and players complained that he was growing more irritable with the years. Former Yankee catcher Ralph Houk, who had been successful as a minor league manager and was Stengel's first base coach, was seen by ownership as the next manager of the Yankees. Stengel's contract, his fifth two-year deal, was up after the 1958 season. As ownership debated whether to renew it, the Yankees led by as many as 17 games, and won the pennant by 10. The Braves were the opponent in the 1958 World Series. The Braves won three of the first four games, but the Yankees, backed by the pitching of Bob Turley (who got two wins and a save in the final three games) stormed back to win the Series. Firing Stengel under such circumstances was not possible, and ownership gave him another two-year contract, to expire after the 1960 season.|$|E
