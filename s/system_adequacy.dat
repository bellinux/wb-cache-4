50|$|Macroeconometric {{models have}} a supply and a demand side for {{estimation}} of these parameters. Kydland and Prescott {{call it the}} system of equations approach. Large-scale macroeconometric model {{can be defined as}} a set of stochastic equations with definitional and institutional relationships denoting the behaviour of economic agents. The supply side determines the steady state properties of the macroeconometric model. The macroeconometric model designed by the model builder is significantly influenced by his interests, information, purpose behind its construction, time and financial constraints in the research. The size and nature of the model will change because of the above considerations while building the same. According to Pesaran and Smith the macroeconometric model must have three basic characteristics viz. relevance, adequacy and consistency. Relevance means the model must be according to the requirements of the desired output. Consistency will expect the model to be inline with the existing theory and inner working of the described <b>system.</b> <b>Adequacy</b> explains the model to be better in terms of its predictive performance. The main objective of the model decides its size.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an innovative contribution {{in considering the}} combined effect of wind farms and grid transmission capacity on loss of load probability (LOLP), rather than just the effect of wind capacity alone. The demonstrated methodology can be generally applied in <b>system</b> <b>adequacy</b> studies for generation expansion and transmission planning. This is of high relevance for planning the power systems of the future with large offshore wind farms and strong transnational grids. The methodology is demonstrated using data from a real life regional hydro-based power system with a predicted need for new generation and/or reinforcement of interconnections to meet future demand. The region is in proximity to favourable offshore wind resources that can be an option for new generation. The question is if adding wind power to the hydro-based system will be sufficient or if additional measures {{must be taken to}} secure <b>system</b> <b>adequacy.</b> The paper concludes that wind power and grid expansion will {{have a positive effect on}} <b>system</b> <b>adequacy.</b> Wind power contributes to reducing the LOLP and can be attributed a capacity value. It shows that the smoothing effect due to geographical distribution of wind power contributes significantly to increasing the wind capacity value in systems with high penetration of wind energy. Further, the LOLP and wind capacity value are sensitive towards the assumed average wind power generation, but robust towards normal variations of the availability and power curve...|$|E

40|$|Power {{systems are}} planned {{such that they}} have {{adequate}} generation capacity to meet the load, according to a defined reliability target.

40|$|As {{the shares}} of {{variable}} renewable generation in power systems increase, so does the need for, inter alia, flexible balancing mechanisms. These mechanisms help ensure the reliable operation of the electricity system by compensating for fluctuations in supply or demand. However, a focus on short-term balancing is sometimes neglected when assessing future capacity expansions with long-term energy system models. Developing heuristics that can simulate short-term system issues {{is one way of}} augmenting the functionality of such models. To this end, we present an extended functionality to the Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS), which captures the impacts of short-term variability of supply and demand on <b>system</b> <b>adequacy</b> and security. Specifically, we modelled the <b>system</b> <b>adequacy</b> as the share of wind energy is increased. Further, we enable the modelling of operating reserve capacities required for balancing services.

40|$|The in situ surface marine climate observing system {{includes}} {{contributions from}} several {{different types of}} observing platforms. Most observations come from mobile platforms, e. g. ships or surface drifting buoys. Climate applications using marine observations often require fields of environmental parameters to be constructed on regular spatiotemporal grids. User requirements are therefore typically presented in terms of parameter uncertainty at particular space and timescales. It is therefore important to relate the characteristics of marine observations, {{in terms of their}} expected quality and sampling distribution, to these requirements. A simple method to estimate the instrumental uncertainty in fields derived from a mixture of observation types is presented. This method enables preliminary assessment {{of the extent to which}} the available observations meet the stated user requirements. Example observing <b>system</b> <b>adequacy</b> assessments are presented for two climate variables, sea surface temperature (SST) and marine air temperature (MAT) using in situ data. The method is also applicable to gridded data sets constructed from combined in situ and satellite data. While the global metrics for SST show an improvement in observing <b>system</b> <b>adequacy</b> over time, the adequacy for MAT is declining. The assessments can determine the most efficient approach to improving observing <b>system</b> <b>adequacy.</b> For in situ SST the best approach would be to increase the number of different platforms making observations. For MAT, increasing the number of observations overall, regardless of platform and increasing the geographical coverage is required to reduce the uncertainty. The assessments would be improved by more extensive evaluation of uncertainties associated with each different variable for each platform type. It would also be beneficial to review the completeness of the user requirements: e. g. to include user requirements relating to the stability of averages on large space and timescales required for climate monitoring, or for constructing estimates of air–sea exchange...|$|E

Demand Response is able to increase the <b>system’s</b> <b>adequacy</b> and to substantially reduce the need for investment in peaking generation by shifting consumption away from times of high demand.

Adding stability to the system, it lowers the need for coal and gas fired spinning reserves – most running power plants burn fuel continuously in order to be ready to supply power at short notice. It furthermore decreases the need for local network investments, as it shifts consumption away from peak hours in regions with tight network capacity. Demand Response delivers these benefits by providing consumers – residential, commercial or industrial – with control signals and/or financial incentives to adjust their consumption at strategic times.

Power system reliability evaluation techniques are now highly developed through the work of many researchers and engineers. It is expected that the application of power system reliability evaluation in bulk power systems {{will continue to increase}} in the future especially in the newly deregulated power industry. This thesis presents research conducted on the three areas of incorporating multi-state generating unit models, evaluating system performance indices and identifying transmission deficiencies in composite <b>system</b> <b>adequacy</b> assessment. The research was done using a previously developed software package designated as MECORE. Many generating companies in both the traditionally regulated and newly deregulated electrical power industry have large generating units that can operate in one or more derated states. In this research work, load point and system reliability indices are evaluated using two-state and multi-state generating unit models to examine the impact of incorporating multi-state generating unit models in composite <b>system</b> <b>adequacy</b> assessment. The intention behind deregulation in the power industry is to increase competition in order to obtain better service quality and lower production costs. This research illustrates how Canadian power systems have performed in the past using data compiled by the Canadian Electricity Association. A procedure to predict similar indices is presented and used to estimate future performance and the effects of system modifications. The incentives for market participants to invest in new generation and transmission facilities are highly influenced by the market risk in a deregulation environment.
