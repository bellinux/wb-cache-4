2500|$|Speech {{language}} pathologists {{teach people}} who stutter {{to control and}} monitor {{the rate at which}} they speak.

When learning to control speech rate, people often begin by practising smooth, fluent speech at rates that are much slower than typical speech, using short phrases and sentences. Over time, people learn to produce smooth speech at faster rates, in longer sentences, and in more challenging situations until speech sounds both fluent and natural. When treating stuttering in children, some researchers recommend that an evaluation be conducted every three months in order {{to determine whether or not}} the selected treatment option is working effectively.

Not only are the topological differences between the words relevant here, but the differentials between what is signified is also covered by différance.

This is true not only with syntagmatic succession in relation with paradigmatic simultaneity, but also, in a broader sense, between diachronic succession in History related with synchronic simultaneity inside a [...] "system of distinct signs".|$|E
