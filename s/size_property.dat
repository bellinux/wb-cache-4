40|$|In {{order to}} avoid using {{polyvinyl}} alcohol (PVA), an eco-friendly sizing technology with atmospheric pressure plasma treatment and green sizing recipes has been developed and evaluated with respect to <b>sizing</b> <b>properties</b> and desizing efficiency. The {{results show that the}} eco-friendly sizing technology can endow cotton yarn with better <b>sizing</b> <b>properties,</b> including significantly improved size-pick-up, breaking strength, breaking elongation, abrasion resistance and substantially reduced yarn hair, than the traditional sizing technology with the use of PVA. Compared with a typical traditional sizing technology using PVA and modified starch, the optimized eco-friendly sizing technology can impart the yarn an increase of 19. 4 %, 5. 3 %, 3. 4 % and 169. 2 % for the size-pick-up, breaking strength, breaking elongation and the abrasion resistance time, respectively, and a reduction of 59. 3 % for the yarn hairiness index value at level 1. The <b>sizing</b> <b>properties</b> can be obviously improved by the atmospheric pressure plasma treatment, which can roughen the fiber surface, etch away the hydrophobic cuticle layer and introduce polar groups. The glycerol in the green sizing recipes can effectively reduce the yarn hairiness and increase size-pick-up and abrasion resistance. The eco-friendly sizing technology has no observable negative influence on desizing of cotton fabrics. Furthermore, a better water diffusion in the fabric can be achieved because of the improved hydrophilicity by using the plasma treatment. Keyword...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{consistent}} and inconsistent long-run variance estimation on a unit root test based on the generalization of the von Neumann ratio. The results from the Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the tests based on an inconsistent estimator have less size distortion and more stability of size across different autocorrelation specifications {{as compared to the}} tests based on a consistent estimator. This improvement in <b>size</b> <b>property,</b> however, comes at the cost of a loss in power. The finite sample power, as well as the local asymptotic power, of the tests with an inconsistent estimator is shown to be much lower than that of conventional tests. This finding resembles the case of the autocorrelation robust test in the standard regression context. The paper also points out that combining consistent and inconsistent estimators in the long-run variance ratio test for a unit root is one possibility of balancing the size and power.

It is also found that both modified tests dominate the Lobato test in terms of local asymptotic power and in terms of finite sample power and the Phillips-Sun-Jin modification seems to outperform the Jansson modification.
