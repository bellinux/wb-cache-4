50|$|Between 1964-69, {{the last}} of the copper mines at Eisleben and Hettstedt were closed. Carriage of {{passengers}} ceased in 1970. The <b>smeltery</b> in Eisleben closed in 1972 and the track between Eisleben and Helbra was lifted some years later. In 1989, the <b>smeltery</b> and power station at Helbra closed, and with it the railway too.|$|E
50|$|Argentine was {{primarily}} recognized for the prosperous silver <b>smeltery</b> {{for which it}} was named. Built on the site of a former Shawnee reservation, the proximity of the railroad, local lumber sources, the <b>smeltery,</b> and in later years, steel manufacturing, meant that the city enjoyed a considerable amount of economic success for quite some time.|$|E
50|$|In 1851, Trebizond-born Charalambos Koundourov (locally {{known as}} Usta Allahverdi) built two copper <b>smelteries</b> near Ordubad where the core staff {{consisted}} of Greek labourers. Ten years later, {{a school and}} a church for the Greek community were built there as well. The church was headed by Nikolaos Lavos. Koundourov's sons owned the <b>smelteries</b> after his death until the October Revolution.|$|R
50|$|Within this mining region there were, historically, a {{large number}} of <b>smelteries</b> and, even today, there are still various active {{smelting}} works, for example, in Muldenhütten.|$|R
50|$|In his Gvozdansko Castle, not {{far from}} Zrin, {{he had his own}} silver coins minted, like his father had done before. There were silver, gold and lead ore mines, <b>smelteries,</b> {{foundries}} and mints in his property.|$|R

50|$|In 1865 and 1883, Siemens built two copper <b>smelteries</b> in Gadabay and a {{hydroelectric}} {{station in}} Galakand. In the 1860s, it initiated cobalt extraction in Dashkasan and built two power stations in Baku. The Siemens <b>smelteries</b> were officially closed down in 1914 when the Russian Empire entered World War I fighting against Germany and the Tsarist government banned all German businesses in Russia. Baku's booming oil industry attracted {{many people from}} all over the Caucasus there. By 1903, the German population of the city had grown to 3,749 (2.4% of the city's entire population at the time) and consisted mostly of natives of the original German colonies. Nikolaus von der Nonne, an ethnic German who had been working in Baku since 1883, was the mayor of Baku from 1898 to 1902.|$|R
50|$|During {{both the}} 18th and the 19th century the iron {{operations}} were dominating {{the economy in}} the area. <b>Smelteries</b> and trip hammers were built on several locations, not only in Fredriksberg but also in Ulriksberg, Tyfors, Strömsdal and Gravendal, whereas the latter later would become the main actor in the area.|$|R
50|$|The {{closure of}} mines and <b>smelteries</b> {{that had been}} working for almost eight hundred years {{resulted}} in an abrupt change to this monostructured economic area whose problems were exacerbated by the political changes of 1989/90. And newly created business parks and the remediation of contaminated sites did not bring the expected economic recovery.|$|R
50|$|A {{railway track}} {{was built in}} order to {{transport}} the nickel-cobalt concentrate to a Norilsk Nickel <b>smeltery</b> in Harjavalta, Finland.|$|E
5000|$|... 1811 - In Mülheim Johann Dinnendahl founds {{a factory}} to {{manufacture}} steam engines, {{the beginnings of}} the later Frederick William <b>Smeltery.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1849 - For {{the first}} time in the Ruhr, coke was used for steel {{production}} - in the Frederick William <b>Smeltery</b> in Mülheim.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the head}} of the factory, his {{activities}} were imbued with the aspiration to create job opportunities, competitive and modern products and to find market for the produced goods. For these aims the factory grew incessantly, and by 1900 it became a huge corporation with three <b>smelteries</b> and five machine producing facilities.|$|R
5000|$|The {{beginnings}} of the Revierwasserlaufanstalt coincide with the start of mining in the Freiberg region in 1168. The term [...] "water management" [...] in this case embraces the many facilities laid out and expanded time and again to handle water for the mining industry, such as ditches (Kunstgräben), water tunnels (Röschen) and ponds or reservoirs (Kunstteiche), that supplied water to the pits, stamp mills and <b>smelteries.</b>|$|R
50|$|Today, on the {{remaining}} stretch of railway line from Klostermansfeld to Hettstadt via Siersleben, trains of the old Mansfeld Mining Railway recall formerly busy operations on this narrow gauge industrial railway that linked all the shafts, numerous <b>smelteries</b> and other premises of the Mansfeld combine. In addition to its very wide-ranging goods traffic, the mining railway also ran passenger services - and primarily commuter services for the workers.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-18th {{century the}} Morgan family founded an {{ironworks}} {{at the east}} end of the town, though it was on a small scale. And in 1786 a lead <b>smeltery</b> was established to process the lead ore carried from Lord Cawdor's lead mines at Nantyrmwyn, in the north east of the county. Neither of these enterprises were long lived - the lead <b>smeltery</b> was relocated to Llanelli in c.1811. The iron works evolved into a tinplate works, but had failed by around 1900.|$|E
5000|$|... 1781 - Founding of the Gute Hoffnung <b>Smeltery</b> in Sterkrade (in present-day Oberhausen). This {{soon came}} {{under the control of}} a member of the Krupp family.|$|E
50|$|During archeological excavations, near Dolen {{were found}} an ancient village, a late ancient village, a late ancient necropolis, a late ancient fortress, a late medieval church, and {{the remains of}} a <b>smeltery.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Geographically, {{hammer mills}} were {{dependent}} {{on the availability of}} water power. At the same time, there had to be forests nearby to produce the large quantities of charcoal needed. In addition, there had to be deposits of iron ore in the vicinity {{in order to ensure that}} there was only a short distance to transport the iron-containing ores to the <b>smelteries.</b> Finally, agricultural land was needed in order to feed the many craftsmen involved.|$|R
25|$|Although Napata {{remained}} Meroë's religious center, northern Kush eventually {{fell into}} disorder {{as it came}} {{under pressure from the}} Blemmyes, predatory nomads from east of the Nile. However, the Nile continued to give the region access to the Mediterranean world. Additionally, Meroë maintained contact with Arab and Indian traders along the Red Sea coast and incorporated Hellenistic and Indian cultural influences into its daily life. Inconclusive evidence suggests that metallurgical technology may have been transmitted westward across the savanna belt to West Africa from Meroë's iron <b>smelteries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The pond was a water {{reservoir}} to supply water power for mining and smelting. The water {{was used to}} power mine shafts, stamp mills, water mills and <b>smelteries.</b> The pond was laid in 1716 {{under the direction of}} mining director (Bergwerksdirektor), Christian Zacharias Koch. Due to a storm, the dam broke in 1752, after which the sluice valve and drainage outlet (Striegelanlage) could no longer be operated. The deluge of water released by the dam break destroyed the Bärloch Mill (Bärlochsmühle) {{at the end of the}} valley.|$|R
5000|$|... 1758 - On 18 October, a new nine-meter high {{blast furnace}} of the St Antony <b>Smeltery</b> in Osterfeld (in present-day Oberhausen) {{was used for}} the first time. The first ore-based {{production}} in the district.|$|E
5000|$|... 1808 - Krupp sells its {{interest}} in the Gute Hoffnung <b>Smeltery</b> to a syndicate composed of Gottlob Jacoby, Heinrich Huyssen and the brothers Franz and Gerhard Haniel, who unite {{a couple of other}} iron works into the company ...|$|E
50|$|Some {{scholars}} {{affirm that}} {{the pioneers of}} Boituva arrived by train, the former Sorocabana Railway. Others, however assert that the first inhabitants were ex-workers of the then extinct iron <b>smeltery</b> on Ipanema farm, thus closed, forcing them to acquire neighboring lands.|$|E
50|$|By 1930, the Mansfelder Bergwerksbahn system {{extended}} to 95 km of track, serving 13 copper mines, two <b>smelteries</b> and had interchanges with two station served by standard gauge trains. Transporter wagons were introduced during the 1930s, along with air brakes on the rolling stock. Traffic on the Mansfelder Bergwerksbahn {{reached its peak}} in 1955. The first diesel locomotives were introduced in 1961. In 1965, steam locomotive No. 10 was converted to use heavy oil as its fuel, the first narrow gauge locomotive in Germany to be so converted.|$|R
5000|$|Under §283 {{of the law}} {{covering}} the mining by royal assent in the Kingdom of Saxony dated 22 May 1851 the Kurfürst-Johann-Georg-Stolln, the Tiefe Fürstenstolln, the Thelersberger Stolln, the Alte tiefe Fürstenstolln, the Dörnthaler Wasserleitung, the Junger Fürst zu Sachsen Müdisdorfer Rösche, the Martelbacher Rösche the Muldenwasser-Versorgung [...] "with all their fixtures of <b>smelteries,</b> mills, water tunnels, ponds, adits and galleries, whose rights and responsibilities (Rutzungen) and even their entire assets" [...] were transferred to the [...] "Gesammteigenthum des Freiberger Reviers" [...] which had the title of [...] "Revierwasserlaufsanstalt".|$|R
50|$|The monastery complex was {{severely}} {{damaged by the}} 1348 Friuli earthquake and the convent experienced economical difficulties exacerbated by several Black Death epidemics in the following decades. In 1495 the monks leased parts of the premises to Jakob Fugger and his brothers who had <b>smelteries</b> and a trip hammer erected. Nevertheless, the situation worsened during the Protestant Reformation, when the convent stood at the brink of financial ruin. In {{the course of his}} Counter-Reformation measures around 1600, the Habsburg archduke Ferdinand II of Austria pursued plans to hand over the monastery to the Jesuits which however were not carried out.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>smeltery</b> finally closed, {{the city}} {{found itself in}} the throes of an {{unprecedented}} financial crisis and began to seek entry to nearby Kansas City in 1907. Although the community was annexed and became the seventh ward of Kansas City, KS in 1910, the neighborhood retains its own distinct flavor and personality.|$|E
50|$|Copper ore {{is found}} around Mansfeld, {{and has been}} mined since 1199. In 1885, a 5.5 km long railway opened linking the Glückhilf mine at Welfesholz and the Kupferkammer <b>smeltery</b> at Hettstedt. At first, the railway only carried goods traffic, but in 1882 the {{carriage}} of miners commenced. In 1883, workshops were established at Klostermansfeld.|$|E
50|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times. They were granted on 14 July 1989. The arms show a gold bell {{on a red}} background. Tolga was home to the smeltehytte from 1666 to 1871, and the bell represents the old bell {{in the town square}} at the center of Tolga. The <b>smeltery</b> was important because of the prevalence of mining in the area.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe have {{identified}} 147 clear 8 nm diameter particle formation {{events at the}} SMEAR I station in Värriö, northern Finland during calendar years 1998 ? 2002. The events have been classified in detail according to the particle formation rate, growth rate, event starting time, different gas phase species concentrations and pre-existing particle concentrations as well as various meteorological conditions. Most of the events occurred during the spring months between March and May, suggesting that increasing biological activity might produce the precursor gases for particle formation. The apparent 8 nm particle formation rates were around 0. 1 /cm 3 s, and they were uncorrelated with growth rates that vary between 0. 5 and 10 nm/h. The air masses, which had clearly elevated sulphur dioxide concentrations above 1. 6 ppb came, as expected, {{from the direction of}} Nikel and Monschegorsk <b>smelteries.</b> Only 15 formation events {{can be explained by the}} pollution plume from these sources...|$|R
50|$|Ore mining largely {{came to a}} {{standstill}} in the 17th century, especially after the Thirty Years' War. Due to the very sharp decline of the mining industry and because the search for new ore deposits proved fruitless, the population {{had to resort to}} other occupations. Agricultural yields were low, however, and also the demand for wood was reduced by the closure of <b>smelteries.</b> Many people were already active at that time in textile production. However, since that was not enough for subsistence, the manufacture of wooden goods and toys developed, especially in the Eastern Ore Mountains. Here, the artisans were required by Prince-Elector Augustus under the Timber Act of 1560, to buy their wood in Bohemia. Wood from the Saxon Ore Mountains was still needed for the mines and smelters in Freiberg. This export of timber led, among other things, to the construction of an artificial cross-border rafting channel, the Neugrabenflöße, along the river Flöha. Because of the decline in industrial production in that period, people without any ties migrated to the interior of Germany or Bohemia.|$|R
5|$|The {{evolution}} of Chiprovtsi from a mining town to a trade hub owes {{much to the}} settlement of merchants from the Republic of Ragusa (today Dubrovnik, Croatia) {{and the quality of}} the local metalworking, as well as the lack of permanent Ottoman presence and the privileges enjoyed by the population. By the mid-17th century, mining was in decline, as the silver deposits had been all but exhausted (in 1666 there remained only 16 iron <b>smelteries),</b> forcing the population to seek a more profitable occupation. Since 1659, the Ragusan merchants from Provadiya altered their traditional route to Dubrovnik through Sofia in order to visit Chiprovtsi. The local residents produced and traded with leather, carpets, fabrics, clothes, remarkable gold and silver jewellery, metal tools, cattle, etc. Initially, the Chiprovtsi merchants would only visit Vidin, Pirot, Sofia and Vratsa. Later, however, they appeared at the markets in Istanbul, Thessaloniki, Bucharest, Odessa, Braşov, Sibiu, Belgrade, Buda and Pest, with a particularly strong presence in Wallachia and Transylvania, where they established permanent agencies and sizable companies in Târgovişte, Câmpulung and Râmnic during the rule of Matei Basarab (1632–1654). The international trade broadened the outlook of the locals and introduced the ideas of the age and the European culture of the time to the region.|$|R
