25|$|In {{contrast}} to the melodrama or kung-fu action films of the earlier decades, New Taiwanese Cinema films {{are known for their}} realistic, down-to-earth, and sympathetic portrayals of Taiwanese life. These films sought to portray genuine <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> living either in urban or rural Taiwan, and are often compared stylistically to the films of the Italian neorealism movement. This emphasis on realism was further enhanced by innovative narrative techniques. For example, the conventional narrative structure which builds the drama to a climax was abandoned and the story progressed at the pace as it would in real life.|$|E
25|$|A {{particular}} kind of bhoot, that of a woman that died during pregnancy or childbirth, {{is known as a}} chudail (dakini in Nepal and eastern India). Chudails look like human women, but their feet are turned backwards or other features are turned upside down. They can change their forms at any time. Chudails often try to lure young men at road crossings and fields or similar places. If a man is enamored of a chudail, it is believed that she will cause his death. There are, however, <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> living with a chudail, or even marrying one.|$|E

500|$|Chatwin {{spent six}} months in Patagonia, {{travelling}} around gathering <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who came from elsewhere and settled there. This trip resulted in the book, In Patagonia (1977). He used his quest for his own [...] "piece of brontosaurus" [...] (the one from his grandparents' cabinet had been thrown away years earlier) to frame {{the story of his}} trip. Chatwin described In Patagonia as [...] "the narrative of an actual journey and a symbolic one... It is supposed to fall into the category or be a spoof of Wonder Voyage: the narrator goes to a far country in search of a strange animal: on his way he lands in strange situations, people or other books tell him strange stories which add up to form a message." ...|$|E

Jaffrey commented, [...] "I {{really wanted to do}} the role because Indian women are usually portrayed as so proper and withdrawn – the kind of women who just stay at home cooking and cleaning. I thought, 'How wonderful of EastEnders to write a character that is realistic.' What my character has done happens all the time in India; {{there are all kinds of}} <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> running away and marrying their lovers. This is what commonly happens in those places, but somehow the image of Indian womanhood is different." [...] Pushpa was a guest character only appearing for the duration of a storyline that revealed Dan had been lying about her death and had actually left him for another man, Pradeep (Kaleem Janjua) Dan's best friend.|$|E

50|$|Ghosts, {{other similar}} supernatural entities, {{as well as}} tales of paranormal powers (such as clairvoyance, psychic {{phenomenon}} etc.) are plots for many short stories and novels in modern-day Bengali literature. Some classic literature and folk-lore are also based on such plot. The number of Bengali films of this genre are small in number compared to the western world. Some radio and TV programs also feature <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>people's</b> paranormal experiences. Common <b>people</b> <b>of</b> both Bangladesh and West Bengal love the supernatural thrills, and the personal <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>people's</b> paranormal experiences are hot topics for gossip, rumours and hangout discussions among friends and family.|$|R

The video features three <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> being either generous or compassionate: the first shows a young man delivering a bottle of milk to an elderly lady, the second shows another young man helping someone push start their car, and the final story shows a young woman consoling another young woman, who is crying. These stories are cut between shots of LZ7 performing [...] "This Little Light" [...] both in front of the tower block and in front of garages.

2500|$|Las Abejas also {{places a}} strong {{emphasis}} on reading and reflecting upon the Bible (the Palabra de Dios, or the Word of God, as they refer to it). [...] Bishop Samuel Ruiz describes Las Abejas as [...] "a movement inspired by the Word of God." [...] Under Bishop Ruiz's leadership, catechists of the Catholic Church encourage collective reflections on the Scriptures (as opposed to the top-down teaching method that had been used prior to the 1970s) in which communities find biblical motivation to struggle against injustice and repression, in the tradition of Latin American liberation theology. [...] One of the founders of Las Abejas says that the members of the organization identify strongly with the story of the Israelites being liberated from slavery in the Old Testament, saying that [...] "these stories of liberation and salvation are alive in today's <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> searching for freedom and justice." [...] Based on their understanding of Scripture, Las Abejas place {{a strong emphasis}} on caring for orphans and providing hospitality to strangers, and their strict pacifism is also founded, at least in part, in their understanding of the Bible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} occurred {{several months after}} the Secret Service's pledge in ACORN v. Secret Service not to discriminate against protesters. [...] "The charges against the Ranks were ultimately dismissed in court and the mayor and city council publicly apologized for the arrest. City officials also said that local law enforcement was acting {{at the request of}} Secret Service." [...] ACLU Senior Staff Attorney Chris Hansen pointed out that [...] "The Secret Service has promised to not curtail the right to dissent at presidential appearances, and yet we are still hearing <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> being blocked from engaging in lawful protest," [...] said Hansen. [...] "It is time for the Secret Service to stop making empty promises." [...] The Ranks subsequently filed a lawsuit, Rank v. Jenkins, against Deputy Assistant to the President Gregory Jenkins and the Secret Service. [...] "The lawsuit, Rank v. Jenkins, is seeking unspecified damages as well as a declaration that the actions leading to the removal of the Ranks from the Capitol grounds were unconstitutional." [...] In August 2007, the Ranks settled their lawsuit against the Federal Government. The government paid them $80,000, but made no admission of wrongdoing. The Ranks' case against Gregory Jenkins is still pending in the District of Columbia.|$|E

60|$|It is {{interesting}} to observe how slowly yet surely Mr. Howells drew near the great field of novel-writing, and how deliberately he laid the foundations of his art. First, the graceful sketch which was hardly more than a leaf out of his note-book; then the blending of travel with character-drawing, as in A Chance Acquaintance and Their Wedding Journey, and later <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who moved about and thus found the incidents which the author had not to invent, as in The Lady of the Aroostook. Meanwhile, the eye which had taken note of surface effects was beginning to look deeper into the springs of being, and the hand which had described was beginning to model figures also which stood alone.|$|E
6000|$|This {{woman was}} drowned; {{but more often}} the persons who are taken 'get the touch,' as it is called, and fall into a half dream, and grow {{indifferent}} to all things, for their true life {{has gone out of}} the world, and is among the hills and the forts of the Sidhe. A faery doctor has told me that his wife 'got the touch' at her marriage because there was one of them wanted her; and the way he knew for certain was, that when he took a pitchfork out of the rafters, and told her it was a broom, she said, 'It is a broom.' She was, the truth is, in the magical sleep, to which people have given a new name lately, that makes the imagination so passive that it can be moulded by any voice in any world into any shape. A mere likeness of some old woman, or even old animal, some one or some thing the Sidhe have no longer a use for, is believed to be left instead of the person who is 'away;' this some one or some thing can, it is thought, be driven away by threats, or by violence (though I have heard country women say that violence is wrong), which perhaps awakes the soul out of the magical sleep. The story in the poem is founded on an old Gaelic ballad that was sung and translated for me by a woman at Ballisodare in County Sligo; but in the ballad the husband found the keeners keening his wife when he got to his house. She was 'swept' at once; but the Sidhe are said to value those the most whom they but cast into a half dream, which may last for years, for they need the help of a living person in most of the things they do. There are many <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who seem to die and be buried--though the country people will tell you it is but some one or some thing put in their place that dies and is buried--and yet are brought back afterwards. These tales are perhaps memories of true awakenings out of the magical sleep, moulded by the imagination, under the influence of a mystical doctrine which it understands too literally, into the shape of some well-known traditional tale. One does not hear them as one hears the others, from the persons who are 'away,' or from their wives or husbands; and one old man, who had often seen the Sidhe, began one of them with 'Maybe it is all vanity.' ...|$|E
