5|$|Recorded {{after an}} unreceptive tour {{with the band}} Tool, Mit Gas has been {{described}} by critics as a more focused and unified album than its predecessor, Tomahawk. The album was supported by a tour alongside Melvins, <b>Skeleton</b> <b>Key</b> and Dälek. Mit Gas has garnered positive reviews, drawing comparisons to the works of Frank Zappa, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin.|$|E
5|$|As the Doctor is a pacifist {{and did not}} use {{the guns}} {{commonly}} found in video games, The Adventure Games utilised a more strategy and puzzle-based gameplay. Much of the first game was based around stealth, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The Doctor was also equipped with his sonic screwdriver, but as this was often used as a <b>skeleton</b> <b>key</b> in the show the game employs the solving of puzzles to advance instead of simply using the screwdriver.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skeleton</b> <b>keys</b> {{have often}} been {{associated}} with attempts to defeat locks for illicit purposes, to release handcuffs for example, and standard keys have been filed down for that purpose. Legitimate <b>skeleton</b> or master <b>keys</b> are used in many modern contexts where lock operation is required and the original key has been lost or is not available. In hotels without electronic locks, <b>skeleton</b> <b>keys</b> are used by housekeeping services to enter the rooms.|$|R

5|$|Ellen tells Mulder {{that she}} saw a {{reflection}} in the mirror earlier, and that's what killed Martha. Mulder believes the glass are doorways to a demonic dimension and that someone is summoning forth a demon to attack people. Ellen believes Jenny Uphouse summoned the spirits, but she denies it. Later, Ellen finds a <b>skeleton</b> <b>key</b> in her house and a raven by her baby's crib. In a mirror, Ellen sees the reflection of a monster chasing after her, but it suddenly breaks. She hides in the closet until Phil comes home and finds her. However, he attributes the commotion to stress, believing that she is imagining things. Mulder finds the <b>skeleton</b> <b>key</b> and it matches one found in Martha Crittendon's coat pocket. Mulder deduces that the sheriff is having an affair with Jenny. Mulder later tells him that Martha was pregnant and that he thinks he is the father. The sheriff reveals that the key opened the door to a motel, where he and Jenny met for clandestine affairs. Meanwhile, at the motel, Jenny sees ravens outside and is promptly attacked and killed by the creature.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2005, he had {{supporting}} {{roles in}} the suspense thriller films The <b>Skeleton</b> <b>Key</b> and Robert Schwentke's Flightplan. In the latter film, Sarsgaard played an air marshall, who is ordered to keep guard of Jodie Foster's character. Flightplan was screened at a special presentation at the 30th annual Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. Despite the mixed reviews, the film was a financial success, earning $223million worldwide, making it his highest-grossing film {{to the end of}} 2008. Sarsgaard's next feature was Jarhead (2005), opposite Jake Gyllenhaal. The movie is based on U.S. Marine Anthony Swofford's 2003 Gulf War memoir of the same name.|$|E
5|$|For some readers, Arthur C. Clarke's more {{straightforward}} novelization of {{the script}} is key to interpreting the film. Clarke's novel explicitly identifies the monolith as a tool created by an alien race that has been through many stages of evolution, moving from organic form to biomechanical, and finally achieving a state of pure energy. These aliens travel the cosmos assisting lesser species to take evolutionary steps. Conversely, film critic Penelope Houston wrote in 1971 that because the novel differs in many key respects from the film, it perhaps should not {{be regarded as the}} <b>skeleton</b> <b>key</b> to unlock it.|$|E

25|$|His play The Skin of Our Teeth {{opened in}} New York on November 18, 1942, {{featuring}} Fredric March and Tallulah Bankhead. Again, the themes are familiar – the timeless human condition; history as progressive, cyclical, or entropic; literature, philosophy, and religion as the touchstones of civilization. Three acts dramatize the travails of the Antrobus family, allegorizing the alternate history of mankind. It was claimed by Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson, authors of A <b>Skeleton</b> <b>Key</b> to Finnegans Wake, {{that much of}} the play was the result of unacknowledged borrowing from James Joyce's last work.|$|E
25|$|Kate Garry Hudson (born April 19, 1979) is an American actress. She rose to {{prominence}} in 2000 for playing Penny Lane in Almost Famous, {{for which she}} won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

25|$|The door {{contains}} the aperture or posting slot. It is hinged, should display the Royal Cypher of the reigning monarch {{and may also}} be fitted with a collection plate showing the times of collection from that location. It is fitted with a brass security lock on the inside. The contractor for these locks has been the Chubb Locks company for many years. They are five-lever locks and each one can exhibit more than 6,500 combinations. There is no <b>skeleton</b> <b>key</b> for these locks.

25|$|In 2002, Hudson {{starred in}} the remake of the {{historical}} romance The Four Feathers, which was panned by critics and audiences. Her next film, the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, was a box office success, grossing over $100million after its February 2003 release. Hudson subsequently appeared in several romantic comedies, including Alex and Emma and Raising Helen; the films met {{with varying degrees of}} success. Hudson later headlined the 2005 thriller The <b>Skeleton</b> <b>Key.</b> The film, which had a production budget of $43million, grossed over $91.9million worldwide ($47.9million in North America). Her next film, a comedy titled You, Me and Dupree and co-starring Owen Wilson and Matt Dillon, grossed $21.5million on its opening weekend of July 14, 2006.|$|E
25|$|Pennies, healing potions, antidotes and, often, quest {{items and}} weapon {{upgrades}} {{can be found}} in chests throughout the game. Often, chests will simply open when Bilbo touches them, but sometimes, the chests are locked, and Bilbo must pick the lock. This involves a timed minigame in which the player must align a pointer or select a specific target. Some chests will have only one minigame to complete, but chests containing more important items will have more, up to a maximum of eight. If Bilbo misses the pointer/target, the timer will jump forward; if he hits a red pointer or target, the minigame will end immediately. Penalties for failing to open a chest include losing health points or being poisoned. If the player has a <b>skeleton</b> <b>key,</b> they can bypass the minigames and open the chest immediately.|$|E
25|$|On 14 November 1998, Cummings and, a briefly reformed, The Sports {{performed}} at the Mushroom Records 25th anniversary concert. His next solo album, Spiritual Bum, had Cummings as record producer and was issued in June 1999. He returned to an acoustic, melancholic sound. Cummings also had his second novel, Stay Away from Lightning Girl, published in 1999, which described an aging musician and his band. In 2001, he released <b>Skeleton</b> <b>Key</b> followed by Firecracker in 2003, Close Ups in 2004, Love-O-Meter in 2005, Space Travel in 2007, and Happiest Man Alive in 2008.

25|$|Hurt {{earned his}} third {{competitive}} BAFTA, {{along with his}} second Oscar and Golden Globe nominations, as Joseph Merrick in David Lynch's biopic The Elephant Man (1980). Other significant roles during the 1980s included Bob Champion in biopic Champions (1984), Mr. Braddock in the Stephen Frears drama The Hit (1984), Winston Smith in Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984) and Stephen Ward in the drama depicting the Profumo affair, Scandal (1989).

500|$|While many, if not all, {{agree that}} {{there is at least}} some sense in which the book can be said to be a [...] "dream", few agree on who the {{possible}} dreamer of such a dream might be. Edmund Wilson's early analysis of the book, The Dream of H. C. Earwicker, made the assumption that Earwicker himself is the dreamer of the dream, an assumption which continued to carry weight with Wakean scholars Harry Levin, Hugh Kenner, and William Troy. Joseph Campbell, in A <b>Skeleton</b> <b>Key</b> to Finnegans Wake, also believed Earwicker to be the dreamer, but considered the narrative to be the observances of, and a running commentary by, an anonymous pedant on Earwicker's dream in progress, who would interrupt the flow with his own digressions.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Lee was {{inducted}} into the Alabama Academy of Honor. In the same year, Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley initiated a reading program throughout the city's libraries, and chose his favorite book, To Kill a Mockingbird, as the first title of the One City, One Book program. Lee declared that [...] "there is no greater honor the novel could receive". By 2004, the novel had been chosen by 25communities for variations of the citywide reading program, more than any other novel. David Kipen of the National Endowment of the Arts, who supervised The Big Read, states [...] "people just seem to connect with it. It dredges up things in their own lives, their interactions across racial lines, legal encounters, and childhood. It's just this <b>skeleton</b> <b>key</b> to so many different parts of people's lives, and they cherish it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Before co-founding {{the company}} in 1921, Harry Soref had been a {{traveling}} locksmith in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, had invented a lock for protecting military equipment, and had founded the [...] "Master Key" [...] company for making master <b>skeleton</b> <b>keys.</b> In 1919, Soref then invented a padlock design that used laminated steel layers to economically produce an exceptionally strong lock body.|$|R
5000|$|His {{numerous}} {{collections of}} poems {{have been widely}} praised, and include Milesian Fables, 1976 ("...an epigrammatic quality - fresh and honest transmissions of experience" [...] - Gavin Ewart; [...] "Very good indeed, entertaining, well-made, and with lovely modulations of mood form grave and tender to the witty and ironic" [...] - Vernon Scannell), Cat Kin, 1994 ("Contagiously cat-like in all its dexterous twists" [...] - Ted Hughes); Living Jazz, 1990 ("Thank you for loving enough and living enough to write Living Jazz" [...] - Maya Angelou) and <b>Skeleton</b> <b>Keys,</b> 2003, of which Angus Calder wrote: [...] "His argument with the world is brilliantly waged. Readers will learn a lot while they are moved by it." [...] The suite of poems that makes up <b>Skeleton</b> <b>Keys</b> explores the troubled era in Greece into which Lykiard was born, reassessing his personal ties with that history - involving family secrets and lies, public and private betrayal and heroism - [...] "to underline how truth and lies are relative at last".|$|R

The film is an imaginary nature documentary.|$|R
500|$|Sora {{appears as}} a child with spiky brown-hair who, when first introduced, wears a red shirt, red pants, and a white and blue jacket covered by keychains. Upon {{traveling}} to certain worlds, Sora's appearance is altered by Donald Duck's magic to adapt to different environments; for example, he turns into a merman in underwater environments. After undergoing significant growth in Kingdom Hearts II, Sora is given a new outfit given by Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather similar to the previous one but mostly black. When battling, Sora's outfit can change into other designs depending on the player's choices. Sora's Keyblade's primary form is the , resembling a classic <b>skeleton</b> <b>key</b> approximately [...] long, with a long, silver keychain extending from the hilt and a Mickey Mouse token {{on the end of}} the keychain. However, through the use of game items known as Keychains, the Keyblade can assume a variety of unique forms. During Kingdom Hearts II, Sora dual-wields Keyblades, but their forms depend on the player's use of Keychains.|$|E
500|$|Roxas is {{depicted}} as a spiky blond-haired boy with blue eyes. Due to his nature as a Nobody, he is an [...] "empty shell" [...] of series' protagonist Sora created when the latter sacrifices his heart and becomes a Heartless during the events of Kingdom Hearts. As a result, despite his teenage appearance, Roxas is one day short of a year old when he rejoins Sora in Kingdom Hearts II. As a civilian, he wears a white jacket over a black one and white trousers. As a member of Organization XIII, Roxas wears a hooded black coat that covers most of his body. His weapon is the Keyblade known as , resembling a classic <b>skeleton</b> <b>key</b> with a long silver keychain extending from the hilt, and a Mickey Mouse token {{on the end of}} it. However, the player can modify it during Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days using the game's panel system.

500|$|Tomahawk is {{a musical}} {{supergroup}} consisting of Mike Patton, vocalist for Faith No More and Mr. Bungle; Duane Denison, guitarist for The Jesus Lizard; Kevin Rutmanis, bass player for Melvins; and John Stanier, drummer for Helmet. Mit Gas was recorded after they toured {{with the band}} Tool, whose fans frequently booed Tomahawk off stage during their performances. Denison has likened the experience of playing to the unreceptive and uninterested crowds as similar to [...] "being pro-choice at a [...] Bush rally {{and trying to make}} your point". Subsequently, the band opted to organize their own tour in support of the album, choosing to work with Melvins, <b>Skeleton</b> <b>Key</b> and Dälek. Speaking about the planning required to stage a four-act tour, Patton stated [...] "that's a lot of music. That's {{a lot of time to}} be sitting in some stinking-ass club with some guy puking in your purse". Tool's guitarist Adam Jones offered to direct a video, but the offer was declined by the band. Reports suggested that a cover of the theme from the movie Flashdance What a Feeling was going to be included on the album, although the song was not on the final track listing.|$|E

50|$|The game {{board and}} its pieces were {{designed}} by Leo Colovini and drawn by artists Christoph Clasen, Claus Stephan, Didier Guiserix, Martin Hoffmann, and Studio Tapiro.

5000|$|A {{character}} {{comes across}} several opportunities to either buy, win, or steal items. Such items include mushrooms, <b>skeleton</b> <b>keys,</b> treasure chests, and others.

If a player rolls the same number twice, he or she gets a bonus of 10 coins. Accordingly, rolling three of the same number with the golden mushroom results in a 30 coin increase.
