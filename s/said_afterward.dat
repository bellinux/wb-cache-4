The NBA {{announced}} that 41 college and high school players and a record 31 international players had filed as early-entry candidates for the 2003 NBA draft. The Cleveland Cavaliers, who had a 22.50 percent probability of obtaining the first selection, won the NBA draft lottery on May 22, and Cleveland chairman Gordon Gund <b>said</b> <b>afterward</b> his team would select LeBron James. The Detroit Pistons and the Denver Nuggets were second and third respectively. Lebron was selected first overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Darko Milicic was selected 2nd overall by the Detroit Pistons. Carmelo Anthony was drafted 3rd overall by the Denver Nuggets.|$|E
25|$|Prosecutors {{attempted}} to try Holmes {{for the murders}} of Kendrick and Bradley in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. But Judge Sylvia Bacon suppressed his murder confession and some additional evidence as illegally obtained. In United States v. Holmes, 380 A.2d 598 (D.C. 1977), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the Superior Court. D.C. prosecutors <b>said</b> <b>afterward</b> {{that they would not}} attempt to try Holmes in the District of Columbia.|$|E
500|$|... "I hope it {{will become}} {{the heart of the}} University," [...] Eleanor Widener <b>said</b> <b>afterward,</b> [...] "a centre for all the {{interests}} that make Harvard a great university." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Laughter," [...] <b>said</b> Sophie <b>afterward</b> {{in their}} own room, [...] "is {{the mark of the}} savage. Why couldn't you control your emotions? It's all real to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] laughed Ida, [...] "was {{probably}} {{the result of}} wearing a smart English skirt. Do you remember the day you fell down and broke her parasol, and what you <b>said</b> immediately <b>afterward</b> about women's fripperies?" ...|$|R
6000|$|As I have said, I do not {{understand}} German, but Mrs. Colesworthy knows the language well, and, stepping up to the man, she <b>said</b> (she <b>afterward</b> told me {{the meaning of the}} words that passed between them): [...] "Are you Dr. Hildstein?" ...|$|R
500|$|Connelly <b>said</b> <b>afterward,</b> [...] " [...] is {{the film}} I'm {{really proud of}} and really love." [...] A.O. Scott of The New York Times said, [...] "There is, for one thing, Ms. Connelly, keen and {{spirited}} in the underwritten role {{of a woman who}} starts out as a math groupie and soon finds herself the helpmeet of a disturbed, difficult man." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 22, Pujols hit {{a three-run}} home run and {{a grand slam}} against John Maine in an 8–7 loss to the Mets. On September 28, with the Cardinals {{trailing}} 2–1 to the Padres in the eighth inning, he hit a game-winning three-run home run against Cla Meredith, helping the Cardinals win 4–2 and end a seven-game losing streak. The win preserved the Cardinals' 1.5 game division lead; La Russa <b>said</b> <b>afterward</b> that it was [...] "the most huge of the huge ones he's hit." ...|$|E
500|$|During the post-race press conference, Harvick and Busch {{commented on}} their {{accident}} during the race. [...] "Harvick pulled a slide job on my {{earlier in the}} day, I crossed over and passed him clean. My guys worked way too hard {{to be in this}} position to have a wrecked race car {{at the end of the}} year. It means so much to me to finish the year strong. I talked to him in the driver’s meeting but Kevin is such a two-faced guy it doesn’t really matter," [...] Busch <b>said.</b> <b>Afterward,</b> Harvick said [...] "Kyle raced me like a clown all day." ...|$|E
60|$|Dick {{then told}} the story of the {{intervention}} of the tiger in their behalf, and <b>said</b> that <b>afterward</b> an Indian lady had succored them, hinting {{that at the end of}} the war it was probable that Ned would present his father with a daughter-in-law.|$|R
2500|$|Morrison {{had stopped}} {{working on her}} latest novel when her son died. She <b>said</b> that <b>afterward,</b> [...] "I stopped writing until I began to think, He would be really put out if he {{thought that he had}} caused me to stop. 'Please, Mom, I'm dead, could you keep going [...] [...] [...] ?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s no good {{talking like}} that," [...] said Hartley, with feeble irritation. [...] "You’re {{as bad as}} my poor old grandmother; she always knew {{everything}} before it happened—at least, she <b>said</b> so <b>afterward.</b> What I want to know is: how is it to be stopped? He has been round three nights running." ...|$|R
500|$|On {{election}} day, Cleveland triumphed, {{carrying the}} entire South and many Northern states. Weaver’s performance {{was better than}} that of any third party candidate since the Civil War, as he won over a million votes—8.5 {{percent of the total}} cast nationwide. In four states, he won a plurality, giving the Populists the electoral votes of Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, and Nevada along with two more votes from North Dakota and Oregon: twenty-two in total. Weaver believed the performance [...] "a surprising success", and thought it portended good results in future elections. [...] "Unaided by money," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>afterward,</b> [...] "our grand young party has made an enviable record and achieved a surprising success at the polls." ...|$|E
500|$|The winning {{time came}} {{early in the}} day, from a likely source: four-time world time trial {{champion}} Fabian Cancellara stopped the clock in 10'33" [...] about {{two hours before the}} race's top overall riders took to the course. Though it did hold up as best, Cancellara <b>said</b> <b>afterward</b> that he was far from certain in his time holding up, considering that he had no reference point. In contrast to the world championships, when he has usually started last as the defending champion and therefore knows the times and splits of his rivals, Cancellara had no such information for this ride. It was Cancellara's first win for [...] and only the second win overall for the team, after the GP Samyn.|$|E
500|$|After the {{original}} broadcast of [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two", NBC ran a commercial advertising [...] "April and Andy's wedding registry" [...] on the official Parks and Recreation website. At {{this point in the}} season, April and Andy were separated and had not yet reconciled. Shortly after the episode aired, HitFix television reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote that the commercial mistakenly used the wrong names and was actually referring to Ron and Tammy's wedding registry. However, after [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party" [...] aired, Schur admitted the commercial was intended to run with that episode, but ran with [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two" [...] due to an error by NBC employees: Schur <b>said</b> <b>afterward,</b> [...] "We sincerely hope that fans of the show are cool with us gently lying to them, in an effort to maintain the surprise nuptials as much as we could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] <b>said</b> I <b>afterward</b> to Mr. Wigglesworth, [...] "they {{might have}} made a better choice than this. While you were {{discussing}} the subject I was struck by at least a dozen simple and natural expressions from the lips of both mother and daughter. One of these would have formed an inscription equally original and appropriate." ...|$|R
500|$|<b>Afterward</b> (<b>said</b> the Boston Evening Transcript) [...] "the {{doors were}} thrown open, and both {{graduates}} and undergraduates {{had an opportunity}} to see the beauties and utilities of this important university acquisition." ...|$|R
6000|$|His answer (as he <b>afterward</b> <b>said)</b> made me blush with pleasure. [...] "Ah, Valeria, I {{should never}} have gone away if I had known you then as well as I know you now!" ...|$|R
500|$|Ruben F. Coleman also <b>said</b> <b>afterward</b> that {{he thought}} Tom was armed, though he later equivocated on this point. He {{was quoted in the}} October 27 issue of The Tombstone Epitaph in which he said, [...] "Tom McLaury fell first, but raised and fired again before he died." [...] Coleman also testified at the coroner’s inquest one day later. Part-time {{newspaper}} reporter Howell 'Pat' Hayhurst transcribed all of the testimony from the hearing in the early 1930s as part of the Federal Writers' Project, in the Works Progress Administration. When he transcribed Coleman's second testimony, he quoted Coleman as saying, [...] "Tom McLaury, after the first two shots were fired, ran down Fremont Street and fell ... I think that the report I gave to the Epitaph was pretty near correct as published." [...] However, it's known that Hayhurst arbitrarily removed text that he decided was not relevant. Author Stuart N. Lake later said Hayhurst ‘mutilated’ the transcription. The documents were subsequently lost and are still unaccounted for.|$|E
500|$|A {{native of}} Troy, Ohio, Bell had {{attended}} Ohio State Buckeyes games {{with his father}} {{from the age of}} six. [...] In high school, {{he was one of the}} top football prospects in Ohio. [...] As a junior [...] at Troy High School in 1970, Bell gained over 1,593yards, scored 146points, led Troy High to its first unbeaten season (10-0) since 1957, and was named to the Associated Press 1970 All-Ohio Class AAA high school first team. [...] In the 1970 season opener, 16-year-old Bell rushed for 324yards and scored fourtouchdowns in a 54–6 win over Piqua High School. [...] Afterward, Bell said, [...] "All I can say is [...] that my line was tremendous." [...] Piqua's coach said, [...] "Our kids were on Bell from the start, but they just couldn't bring him down." [...] In October 1970, Bell put on [...] "one of the greatest one-man shows ever seen at Beavercreek," [...] scoring three touchdowns and rushing for 233yards in 30carries. [...] The Beavercreek coach <b>said</b> <b>afterward</b> that the game's turning point came the moment Bell walked onto the field.|$|E
500|$|Hershey's {{offensive}} problems {{continued in}} a 3–1 loss against the Portland Pirates on November 11, {{in which they}} struggled to get the puck out of their zone and through the neutral zone. Holtby, who made 31 saves, <b>said</b> <b>afterward,</b> [...] "We just seemed to look dead the last couple games." [...] Kalinski suffered a hand injury and would not return until December 27. The Bears fell to Syracuse again on November 16. The 6–1 game, the most lopsided defeat of the season, was their third consecutive loss and third straight home game with only one goal. Hershey broke a three-game losing streak on November 17 with a 4–1 against the Penguins, where Garrett Mitchell scored two goals, including Hershey's first successful penalty shot since February 27, 2010. The team had surrendered two goals or fewer in eight of their past 14 games. But Hershey lost their next two games, including a 4–0 shutout loss to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on November 21. The Binghamton-based Internet radio Power Play Post Show reported from an anonymous source that Penguins head coach John Hynes put a $200 bounty on Bears defenseman Oleksy for that game, a claim Hynes strongly denied.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm in No. 27, {{right next}} to you fellows. Mr. Hicks {{was going to put}} me in with you first, but <b>afterward</b> <b>said</b> a friend of yours was going to fill the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|The miner {{took care}} to gather the tools around him so {{they could not be}} seized in case a sudden rush was made, and then, as he <b>afterward</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "read the riot act" [...] to the trespassers.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{she shut}} her eyes, and looked so white that Ben hurried away, and burst upon old Mrs. Paine, placidly {{knitting}} {{at the end}} door, so suddenly that, as she <b>afterward</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It sca't her like a clap o' thunder." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{the team}} had been shut out in early season stage races, Cancellara was victorious in the short {{individual}} time trial that closed out Tirreno–Adriatico. Taking the course some {{two hours before the}} race's top riders, the four-time world champion covered the [...] distance in 10'33", and only one rider came within ten seconds of his time. At Critérium International in March, five-time champion Voigt was hopeful of breaking the record he shares with Emile Idée and Raymond Poulidor to stand alone as a six-time champion, but admitted that the course and the weather did not suit him, and so his chances would be slim. During the decisive stage 1, Voigt bridged up to a morning breakaway some [...] from the finish on the Col de l'Ospedale. He <b>said</b> <b>afterward</b> that he might slip away unmarked and stay away for victory, but if he were chased it would make the race hard, and a hard race would suit the Schleck brothers. The latter scenario is exactly what occurred. Voigt was caught well before the summit of the Ospedale and finished the day in 75th place, over 20 minutes down, but the Schlecks both stayed with the front group on the road throughout the stage. Fränk Schleck put in his own attack for victory [...] from the summit and stayed away for victory. Andy Schleck was tenth, a minute down on his brother. The elder Schleck brother held his advantage through the flat stage and individual time trial on day two of the three-stage race, emerging as overall victor.|$|E
2500|$|... "Everybody knows Floyd Mayweather is the gold-medal {{favorite}} at 57 kilograms," [...] Mayweather <b>said</b> <b>afterward.</b> [...] "In America, it's {{known as}} 125 pounds. You know and I know I wasn't getting hit. They say he's the world champion. Now {{you all know}} who the real world champion is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Home {{also won}} Grammy awards, and other {{noteworthy}} accolades as before, though it {{fell short of}} reaching the diamond record status {{of the first two}} albums. Natalie Maines <b>said</b> <b>afterward,</b> [...] "I want to check the record books and see how many fathers and daughters have won Grammys together".|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a {{good deal}} in what St. Aldegonde says," [...] <b>said</b> the duke <b>afterward</b> to his wife. [...] "The affair takes rather a {{different}} aspect. It appears they are really people of high consideration, and great wealth too. Nobody could describe them as adventurers." ...|$|R
25|$|His {{tenure at}} Harvard almost ended before it began, {{when he was}} injured in an {{automobile}} accident. Boring fractured his skull and {{had to stay in}} the hospital for six weeks. Also, the accident resulted in temporary retroactive and progressive amnesia. The experience caused Boring to question {{what it means to be}} conscious. If a person could not recall what the person had <b>said</b> moments <b>afterward,</b> could he really be considered conscious? Such questions become a lifelong endeavor for Boring to try to answer.|$|R
5000|$|On February 28, 2010, at 3 p.m. EST, Las Vegas Motor Speedway's Chaplain Joe Freiburger <b>said</b> the invocation. <b>Afterward,</b> America's Got Talent winner Terry Fator {{sang the}} {{national}} anthem. Carroll Shelby and Kim Kardashian gave the command [...] "Gentlemen, start your engines!" [...] for the race.|$|R
2500|$|Against Pennsylvania, Frutig made a “leaping {{catch on}} the goal line” for a {{touchdown}} on a pass from Harmon, as the Wolverines won, 14–0. Frutig played all 60 minutes against Penn and <b>said</b> <b>afterward</b> he could have played 60 minutes more. “Of course,” Frutig added, “I'd need that boy Al Wistert right by me if I had to play {{much more than the}} regulation time.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Patterson and Liston had {{a rematch}} clause in their contract. Patterson wanted {{a chance to}} redeem himself, so they had a rematch on July 22, 1963, in Las Vegas. Patterson, a 4-1 betting underdog, was knocked down three times and counted out at 2:10 of the first round. The fight lasted four seconds longer than the first one. Liston's victory was loudly booed. [...] "The public is not with me. I know it", Liston <b>said</b> <b>afterward.</b> [...] "But they'll have to swing along until {{somebody}} comes to beat me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harty was {{appointed}} permanent {{conductor of the}} Hallé in 1920. [...] Under his baton, the Hallé recovered the eminence it had previously enjoyed under the conductorship of its founder, Charles Hallé, and his successor, Hans Richter. Kennedy writes that under Harty {{it was probably the}} best orchestra in England. [...] Harty's skill as a piano accompanist developed into a similar talent for conducting concertos. Writing of his skill as in accompanying either as a pianist or as a conductor, John F. Russell wrote in 1941, [...] "Anybody who heard Harty in his capacity as accompanist could never forget his extraordinary grasp of every nuance and expressive device. There was no question of a solo with accompaniment: unless the soloist was a very great artist the chances were that he would be submerged by the artistry of the accompanist." [...] Wilhelm Backhaus and others wished they could take the Hallé with them on their international travels. [...] During a Brahms concerto, Artur Schnabel accidentally skipped two bars, but Harty's rapport with and control of the Hallé was such that he kept up seamlessly with the soloist. Schnabel <b>said</b> <b>afterward</b> that he had never experienced such magnificent accompaniment, but tactlessly added that the Hallé was [...] "almost as good as the Berlin Philharmonic"; Harty corrected him: the Hallé was [...] "better by two bars".|$|E
6000|$|Beth {{was furious}} with anger at this baiting. Without abandoning a jot her suspicions she {{realized}} she was powerless to prove her case at this time. With a few bitter and cutting remarks--made, she <b>afterward</b> <b>said,</b> in [...] "self-defense"--she retreated as gracefully as possible and drove home.|$|R
60|$|This {{conversation}} {{was held in}} a whisper, to prevent its being overheard by the various groups in the room. The duke <b>afterward</b> <b>said</b> {{that he had to}} repeat his words several times to make the king comprehend them, his sense of hearing having obviously begun to fail.|$|R
60|$|A fine funny gentleman, thought I, {{not much}} fancying, however, his levity {{concerning}} my great-uncle, he'll be cracking his jokes the whole voyage; and so I <b>afterward</b> <b>said</b> {{to one of}} the riggers on board; but he bade me look out, that he did not crack my head.|$|R
