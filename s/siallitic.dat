40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of edaphic factors in influencing woody vegetation diversity and structure in savannas, there is still limited research on the topic across most savanna ecosystems. Here we investigate the differences and/or similarities of woody vegetation diversity and structure across areas with different edaphic factors (i. e. soil group) in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe. We stratified our study area into two strata based on soil group, namely <b>siallitic</b> soil in northern Gonarezhou and regosol soil in central Gonarezhou. Data were collected from 96 sample plots between March and April in 2011. Our results showed significantly higher woody species diversity in <b>siallitic</b> soil stratum compared to regosol soil stratum. In contrast, {{there were no significant}} differences in woody vegetation structure between the two study strata. Our results suggest that soil variations play an important role in influencing woody vegetation diversity more than woody vegetation structure in Gonarezhou. Future studies should investigate the role of soils on a specific woodland type's composition and structure, and also determine the interactive effects between soils and other environmental determinants in Gonarezhou and similar protected areas in savanna ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSoil {{classification}} systems organize soil variability into useful groupings {{that can}} be identified by field investigation and documented in soil survey, and {{form the basis for}} the exchange and extension of soil science research and soil resources management. Fuzzy clustering analysis may be used whenever a composite classification of soil incorporates multiple parameters. In this paper, seventy-seven topsoil samples were collected from Qinghai and Heilongjiang of China, and the element contents of topsoil were detected by wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. In fuzzy clustering analysis, all data were standardized, and then a fuzzy similarity matrix was established and the fuzzy relation was stabilized. The results showed that topsoil samples of Qinghai and Heilongjiang were completely grouped into two clusters according to their districts, when given a suitable threshold Î»= 0. 7580. This work supplied the quantification classification method of alpine soil (Qinghai) and unsaturation <b>siallitic</b> soil (Heilongjiang) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the structure and}} composition of vegetation communities across different land uses in the northern Gonarezhou National Park and adjacent areas, southeast Zimbabwe. Vegetation {{data were collected from}} 60 sample plots using a stratified random sampling technique from April to May 2012. Stratification was by land use, and sample plots in all three strata occurred on predominantly <b>siallitic</b> soils. Our results show that the communal area had higher woody plant species diversity (H' = 2. 66) than the protected area (H' = 1. 78). However, the protected area had higher grass species richness per plot than the communal area and resettlement area. Overall, the protected area had more structural and compositional diversity than the other land use areas. These findings suggest that the areas adjacent to protected areas contribute to plant diversity in the greater ecosystem; hence conservation efforts should extend beyond the boundaries of protected areas. We recommend that protected area management should engage community-based institutions in neighbouring areas for effective monitoring of woody vegetation structure and composition...|$|E
