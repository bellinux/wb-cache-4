Cow body weights and condition scores of cows in strip-stocked pastures in mid to late season were lower than cows in continuously or rotationally stocked pastures, but daily methane emissions in June or August did not significantly differ between stocking systems. Results imply limiting intake of lower quality pasture forage has negative effects on cow body weight and condition while not affecting daily methane emissions...|$|R

Having previously rejected a bid from the cattlemen to buy the land for $3.00 per acre, the Cherokee protested in vain that the government price was too low. President Benjamin Harrison forbade all grazing in the Cherokee Outlet after October 2, 1890, which eliminated all profit from leasing the land. After that, the Cherokee sold off the land at prices ranging from $1.40 to $2.50 per acre.

40|$|Fact sheet {{written for}} the Inventions and Innovation Program about a new method for making steel {{strapping}} and <b>strip</b> from rod <b>stock</b> produced from scrap steel. There is a large movement in the American steel industry to utilize more recycled steel. Recycled steel melted in the electric arc furnaces of mini-mills is being used {{as the source of}} raw materials for an increasing number of products, largely due to its lower price. However, conventional processes for producing steel strapping and cold-rolled strip steel restrict manufacturers from using more than 50 % recycled steel. In addition, steel strapping and cold-rolled strip steel traditionally require many production steps. They are produced from primary steel that has been cast into slab, heated, rolled to achieve the desired thickness, and slit to the desired width. The slitting process produces microcracks {{along the edge of the}} strapping or strip, which reduce tensile strength. A new continuous process produces steel strapping and 1 / 2 inch to 6 inch strip steel from the rod and <b>strip</b> <b>stock</b> made from scrap steel in mini-mills. The new process creates steel strapping and strip with improved strength and quality due to the absence of microcracks caused by the conventional slitting process. The finished product is cheaper because of the lower cost associated with using rod ad lower conversion costs. In addition, the higher tensile strength of the product allows for thinner strapping. The process represents a new approach to producing any steel strapping used for bundling and packaging items for storage or transport. In addition, this innovative new process can be used to produce cold-rolled strip steel, a basic raw material for automobile parts, hardware, office equipment, and many other products...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{stocking}} densities of fall-calving Angus cattle grazing cool-season pastures on {{cow and calf}} performance; forage mass, quality, and botanical composition; soil carbon content and compaction; and grazing selectivity of cattle were evaluated. Two blocks of three 10 -acre cool-season pastures, divided into 1 -acre paddocks, were grazed by 10 fall-calving Angus cows by one of three stocking systems: rotational stocking (RS, low <b>stocking</b> density), <b>strip</b> <b>stocking</b> (SS, moderate stocking density), and mob stocking (MS, high stocking density). Pastures were grazed from mid-May through late September in 2010 (yr 1) and 2011 (yr 2). Cattle received a daily live forage dry matter (DM) allowance of 4. 0 and 3. 2 % of cow body weight (BW) in yr 1 and 2, respectively. Cattle in RS pastures were moved to new paddocks after initial forage sward height, measured with a falling plate meter (8. 8 lb/yd 2), was reduced by 50 % by measurement (yr 1), and after the estimated intake at 3. 2 % of cow BW/day (yr 2). Cattle in SS and MS pastures received strips containing 100 and 25 % of the daily forage allowance one and four times per day, respectively. Cow BCS did not differ between treatments in any month of either year. Cow BW was greater in MS than RS and SS pastures in June of yr 2 and greater in RS than MS pastures in August of yr 2, but {{did not differ in}} any other months of either year. Birth weight and average daily gain (ADG) of live calves {{at the end of the}} trial did not differ between treatments in either year; however, there were fewer calves per cow in MS pastures at the termination of the trial in yr 2. Forage sward height did not differ between treatments in any month of either year. Rotational stocking decreased forage disappearance in yr 2 compared to <b>strip</b> or mob <b>stocking.</b> Forage disappearance was lower in RS than SS and MS pastures in May and June of both years and was greater in RS than SS pastures in September of yr 1, but did not differ in any other months. Forage botanical composition prior to grazing each year did not differ between years, but dead forage as a percent of total forage DM was lower in RS than SS and MS pastures in yr 2. Soil bulk density from 0 - 3 inches in yr 1, water infiltration rate into the soil in either year, and penetration resistance at depths of 0 and 3 inches in yr 2, did not differ between treatments in any month. Soil penetration resistance at 6 inches was greater in SS than RS and MS pastures in May, and was greater in MS than SS pastures in August. Grazing selectivity did not differ between treatments in yr 1. Results suggest that, at constant forage allocation, mob stocking does not affect cow or live calf performance, but may reduce the proportion of surviving calves. Mob stocking also does not affect forage mass, botanical composition, or soil compaction measures within the first two years of implementation...|$|R
40|$|This paper takes a {{new look}} at the {{cross-border}} dividend-stripping transactions that gave rise to the Fifth Circuit’s opinion in Compaq v. Commissioner and the Eighth Circuit’s opinion in IES Industries v. Commissioner. In both cases, the circuit courts held for the taxpayers and rejected the Commissioner’s claim that the transactions lacked economic substance because the taxpayers were sure to lose money on the transactions before taxes. These cases generated extensive commentary that was split into two diametrically opposed camps. One group argued that the decisions were correct because the transactions were economically profitable business transactions. The other group argued that the transactions were blatant, abusive tax shelters; and that the courts should have struck them down. Because the commentators in the second group conceded that the transactions generated a pre-tax profit, these commentators also offered a range of proposals to modify or replace the pre-tax profit test. Although the tax benefit of crossborder dividend-stripping was sharply reduced by subsequent Congressional enactments, that action hid rather than resolved the issue whether the tax shelter jurisprudence is fundamentally flawed because there is a class of abusive transactions that produce a guaranteed profit before tax, but do not run afoul of the anti-abuse provisions in the tax law. This paper argues that the Compaq and IES Industries transactions do not reveal any fundamental failings with either anti-abuse jurisprudence generally or the pre-tax profit test in particular. This paper demonstrates that the circuit courts reached the wrong conclusions in those cases because the parties, the courts, and the commentators all ignored implicit taxes. That is not surprising because the implicit taxes in these cases were difficult to see. These taxes were negative implicit taxes, which drove down the cum dividend price of the <b>stripped</b> <b>stock,</b> and therefore made the transactions appear profitable before taxes. However, once implicit taxes are taken into account, the transactions in those cases are properly understood to be unprofitable before taxes. Finally, nearly ten years ago, Charlotte Crane observed that tax doctrine has all but ignored implicit taxes and she challenged commentators, lawyers and judges to think carefully about how implicit taxes can be incorporated into tax doctrine. My proposal to calculate pre-tax profit for the purpose of anti-abuse jurisprudence before both implicit and explicit taxes is, I believe, the first proposal to explicitly recognize implicit taxes in tax doctrine...|$|R

In the summer of 1995, two cuttings of hay were harvested from two 15 -acre fields containing “Johnston” endophyte-free tall fescue and red clover, and two cuttings of hay were taken from two 15 -acre fields of smooth bromegrass and red clover. Hay yields were 4, 236 and 4, 600 pounds of dry matter per acre for the tall fescue [...] red clover and smooth bromegrass [...] red clover. Following grain harvest four 7. 5 -acre fields containing corn crop residue were stocked with cows at midgestation at an allowance of 1. 5 acres per cow. Forage yields at the initiation of corn crop grazing were 3, 766 pounds of dry matter per acre for corn crop residue, 1, 748 pounds for tall fescue [...] red clover, and 1,. 880 pounds for smooth bromegrass [...] red clover. Corn crop residues and stockpiled forages were grazed in a <b>strip</b> <b>stocking</b> system. For comparison, 20 cows were placed in two drylots simultaneously to the initiation of corn crop grazing where they remained throughout the winter and spring grazing seasons. Cows maintained in drylot or grazing corn crop residue and stockpiled forages were supplemented with hay as large round bales to maintain a body condition score of five. No seasonal differences in body weight and body condition were observed between grazing cows or cows maintained in drylot, but grazing cows required 87 % and 84 % less harvested hay than cows in drylot during the winter and spring respectively. Because less hay was needed to maintain grazing cows, an excess of 11, 905 and 12, 803 pounds of hay dry matter per cow remained in the year-round grazing system. During corn crop grazing, organic matter yield decreased at 27. 3 pounds of organic matter per day from grazed areas of corn crop residue. Organic matter losses due to weathering were 9. 4, 12. 9, and 15. 8 pounds per day in corn crop residue, tall fescue-red clover and smooth bromegrass-red clover.

This results in <b>stock</b> <b>stripping</b> bark off the trunk. Also the growth rate of the plant slows and leaves will be shed. The grazing management is all designed to prevent flowering and keep tagasaste in the vegetative juvenile state. Trials have shown that if tagasaste is heavily grazed and / or mechanically cut in the any one of the first 6 months of the year it will not flower in the second half of the year. Occasionally when mechanically cutting one limb on a plant can be missed.

This approach consists of creating different sets of kinases and their corresponding substrates in multi-tube <b>strips.</b> The kinase <b>stocks</b> are pre-standardized for optimal kinase activity and used for inhibitor profiling using a bioluminescent ADP detection assay. We show that these strips can routinely generate inhibitor selectivity profiles for small or broad kinase family panels.

We identified two specific PI 3 K inhibitors that have off-target effects on CK 2 that were not reported before and would have been missed if compounds were not profiled against lipid and protein kinases simultaneously. To validate the accuracy of the data generated by this method, we confirmed that the inhibition potencies observed are consistent with published values produced by more complex technologies such as radioactivity assays...|$|R

The importance of cork oak {{lies in the fact}} that cork material constitutes a valuable sustainable source of income. Nevertheless, anthropic activities have strongly affected these landscapes i. e. fires, overgrazing and inappropriate cork harvesting. This thesis describes cork oak forest situation in the Mountain of Bitti-Buddusò, using data from five different floristic composition studies and the economical plan of silvo-pastoral goods of Buddusò, in addition to the phytosociological study that we conducted in 2015. Overall, 362 species were encountered with the dominance of therophytes (44. 5 %) followed by hemicryptophytes (32 %), which presence indicates a high period of summer aridity and the inclusion of areas related to grazing. The chorological spectrum showed the prevalence of Steno and Euri-Mediterranean species (34. 1 and 26. 9 %, respectively) revealing thus the Mediterranean character in which cork oak forests insure an optimum vegetative growth. Moreover, we gathered data from two wildfires that occurred between 2012 and 2014 to examine the post-fire tree responses. The most common response type was crown and basal resprouting (71. 8 %).

This is because of the excessive computational time due to the long strip length and the multiple numbers of stands that have to be modelled. Typically a single solid element is used through the thickness of the sheet for roll forming simulations. Recent investigations have shown that residual stresses introduced during steel processing may affect the roll forming process and therefore need to be included in roll forming simulations. These residual stresses vary in intensity through the thickness and this cannot be accounted for by using only one solid element through the material thickness, in this work a solid-shell element with an arbitrary number of integration points has been used to simulate the roll forming process. The system modelled is that of roll forming a V-channel with dual phase DP 780 sheet steel. In addition, the influence of other modelling parameters, such as friction, on CPU time is further investigated. The numerical results are compared to experimental data and a good correlation has been observed. Additionally the numerical results show that the CPU time is reduced in the model without friction and that considering friction does not {{have a significant effect on}} springback prediction in the numerical analysis of the roll forming process...|$|R

Three figures were huddled up below me, with the moonshine falling on them in ragged streaks through the gaps between the men {{standing}} or sitting above them. The first face I made out was the face of Miss Coleshaw, her eyes were wide open and fixed on me. She seemed still to keep her senses, and, by the alternate parting and closing of her lips, to be trying to speak, but I could not hear that she uttered a single word. On her shoulder rested the head of Mrs. Atherfield. The mother of our poor little Golden Lucy must, I think, have been dreaming of the child she had lost; for there was a faint smile just ruffling the white stillness of her face, when I first saw it turned upward, with peaceful closed eyes towards the heavens. From her, I looked down a little, and there, with his head on her lap, and with one of her hands resting tenderly on his cheek--there lay the Captain, to whose help and guidance, up to this miserable time, we had never looked in vain,--there, worn out at last in our service, and for our sakes, lay the best and bravest man of all our company. I stole my hand in gently through his clothes and laid it on his heart, and felt a little feeble warmth over it, though my cold dulled touch could not detect even the faintest beating. The two men in the stern-sheets with me, noticing what I was doing--knowing I loved him like a brother--and seeing, I suppose, more distress in my face than I myself was conscious of its showing, lost command over themselves altogether, and burst into a piteous moaning, sobbing lamentation over him. One of the two drew aside a jacket from his feet, and showed me that they were bare, except where a wet, ragged <b>strip</b> of <b>stocking</b> still clung to one of them. When the ship struck the Iceberg, he had run on deck leaving his shoes in his cabin. All through the voyage in the boat his feet had been unprotected; and not a soul had discovered it until he dropped! As long as he could keep his eyes open, the very look of them had cheered the men, and comforted and upheld the women. Not one living creature in the boat, with any sense about him, but had felt the good influence of that brave man in one way or another. Not one but had heard him, over and over again, give the credit to others which was due only to himself; praising this man for patience, and thanking that man for help, when the patience and the help had really and truly, as to the best part of both, come only from him. All this, and much more, I heard pouring confusedly from the men's lips while they crouched down, sobbing and crying over their commander, and wrapping the jacket as warmly and tenderly as they could over is cold feet. It went to my heart to check them; but I knew that if this lamenting spirit spread any further, all chance of keeping alight any last sparks of hope and resolution among the boat's company would be lost for ever. Accordingly I sent them to their places, spoke a few encouraging words to the men forward, promising to serve out, when the morning came, as much as I dared, of any eatable thing left in the lockers; called to Rames, in my old boat, to keep as near us as he safely could; drew the garments and coverings of the two poor suffering women more closely about them; and, with a secret prayer to be directed for the best in bearing the awful responsibility now laid on my shoulders, took my Captain's vacant place at the helm of the Long-boat.|$|R
