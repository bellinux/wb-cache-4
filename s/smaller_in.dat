The women's tournament is <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> scale and profile than the men's, but is growing; {{the number of}} entrants for the 2007 tournament was 120, more than double that of 1991.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{males and}} juveniles are quite {{different}} in appearance to the female. They are <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> size, being about one sixth {{the size of an}} adult female. Juveniles have a brown carapace, with a predominantly white abdomen which has a series of red-orange diamonds running along the dorsal region bordered on either side by irregular black lines. Males retain this coloration into adulthood. Due to its much smaller size, Urquhart (1886) believed the male to be a separate species and named it Theridion melanozantha. This was not rectified until 1933 when it was correctly identified as the male Latrodectus katipo.|$|E

5|$|At sunset {{the central}} armies broke contact and withdrew to their {{original}} positions and both fronts were restored along the lines occupied in the morning. The death of Dairjan {{and the failure of}} Vahan's battle plan left the larger Imperial army relatively demoralized, whereas Khalid's successful counterattacks emboldened his troops despite their being <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> number.|$|E
5|$|Cannon also {{transformed}} naval warfare: the Royal Navy, in particular, {{took advantage}} of their firepower. As rifling became more commonplace, the accuracy of cannon was significantly improved, and they became deadlier than ever, especially to infantry. In World War I, a considerable majority of all deaths were caused by cannon; they were also used widely in World War II. Most modern cannon {{are similar to those}} used in the Second World War, including autocannon—with the exception of naval guns, which are now significantly <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> caliber.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{high-performance}} applications involve four-quadrant loads (Quadrants I to IV) {{where the}} speed and torque can be in any direction such as in hoists, elevators, and hilly conveyors.

5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} families {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population {{is more difficult}} {{than it is in}} the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region {{own special}} {{ecological}} environment. Aiming at their particular climate characteristics, the green space system planning of <b>small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region was studied. Through analyzing {{the problems of}} the green space system planning of <b>small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region, the study proposes five levels planning strategy, including developing the regional integrated green space system planning of <b>small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region, building the stable green network structure of town, improving quantity and quality of green space of <b>small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region, strengthening winter landscape construction of <b>small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region, and inheriting ice and snow culture of <b>small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region, in order to promote the sustainable development of green space system planning of <b>small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} moderating role of attempted dietary restraint {{on the amount}} of food consumed from <b>small</b> food <b>in</b> <b>small</b> packages versus large food in large packages. Four experiments demonstrate that restrained eaters consume more calories from <b>small</b> food <b>in</b> <b>small</b> packages, while unrestrained eaters consume more calories from large food in a large package. For restrained eaters, overconsumption of the <b>small</b> food <b>in</b> <b>small</b> packages results from a lapse in self-control caused by the stress of perceiving conflicting food information: the <b>small</b> food <b>in</b> <b>small</b> packages is perceived as both diet food and high in calories.

5|$|The Kadazan-Dusun, {{located on}} the western coast of Sabah, refer to their agung {{ensemble}} as a tawag or bandil, which consists of six to seven large gongs in shoreline groups and 7–8 large gongs for those in interior valleys. In southwestern Sarawak, Bidayuh agung ensembles consist of nine large gongs divided into four groups (taway, puum, bandil, and sanang), while among the Iban of Sawarak, Brunei, Kalimantan, agung ensembles are <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> comparison.|$|E
5|$|The Summer Youth Olympic Games of Singapore in 2010 and Nanjing in 2014 each {{played host to}} 3600 {{athletes and}} lasted 13 days, whereas the Winter YOG of Innsbruck in 2012 had 1059 athletes and Lillehammer in 2016 had 1100 athletes and lasted 10 days. Even though this {{exceeded}} initial estimates, the YOG are still both <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> size as well as shorter than their senior equivalents. The next Summer YOG to take place will be the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games of Buenos Aires. The next Winter YOG to take place will be the 2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games of Lausanne.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is formed by a composite steel and concrete frame, with various setbacks in its profile, meaning {{the upper floors}} are much <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> area than lower levels. Outrigger trusses {{at the top of}} the building and at the various setbacks help to stiffen the building's reinforced concrete core against the strong winds prevalent in the area.

The historical site of Tel Arad and the Arad Park (also known as Ran Grove) can also be found within its municipal area, west of the urban core. Arad also has a commercial landing strip located slightly to the south of its urban core. It borders the Tamar and Abu Basma regional councils, and the closest local municipality to Arad is the Bedouin local council Kuseife.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of smokeless powder, based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose, by the French inventor Paul Vielle in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels. The guns of the pre-Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s {{tended to be}} <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s, most often 12in (305mm), but progressively grew in length of barrel, making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} {{view of a}} {{much larger}} 4th century army has fallen out of favour with some historians in more recent times, as existing evidence has been reappraised and new evidence uncovered.

5|$|Traditionally, {{the metal}} {{used for the}} gandingan was bronze but due to its {{scarcity}} after WWII, gandingan are more commonly made of less valuable metals such as steel sheets. Recently, galvanized steel sheets {{have been used by}} Maguindanaon instrument manufacturers where different parts of the gong (the knob, body and rim) would be made from separate sheets and welded together, then ground out to produce a finished product. Comparatively, these newer gongs have a higher pitch and are <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> size than those made in older times.|$|E
5|$|When {{stationary}} fronts become <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> scale, degenerating to {{a narrow}} zone where wind direction changes over a short distance, they become known as shear lines. If the shear line becomes active with thunderstorms, it may support formation of a tropical storm or a regeneration of the feature back into a stationary front.
