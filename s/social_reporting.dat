Undaunted by a lack of enthusiasm for his initial proposal for the Harvey Milk biography, Shilts reworked the concept, as he later said, after further reflection: I read Hawaii by James Michener. That gave me the concept for the book, the idea of taking people and using them as vehicles, symbols for different ideas. I would take the life-and-times approach and tell the whole story of the gay movement in this way, using Harvey as the major vehicle.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to analyse}} the {{development}} of a <b>social</b> <b>report</b> in a major Italian bank from its formation in 2007 to 2012. The Italian banking sector {{plays an important role in}} the Italian economy. Several Italian frameworks for <b>social</b> <b>reports</b> have been published and used by Italian companies. However, an important framework for <b>social</b> <b>reports</b> in Italy is the GRI. The paper aims to answer the following research questions: 1) what international guidelines have been used by the Bank in its <b>social</b> <b>reports,</b> during the period considered? 2) What have been the structural changes in the <b>social</b> <b>report</b> over time? The aim of these questions is to analyse the structure of the Bank’s six <b>social</b> <b>reports.</b> The paper relies on documentary analysis, applied to six <b>social</b> <b>reports.</b> It is based on G 3 Guidelines and Performance Indicators (PIs). The paper finds that in the six-year period several changes in <b>social</b> <b>reports</b> are highlighted. We conclude that the Bank has engaged in a process of continuous improvement in the information content of the <b>social</b> <b>report,</b> including recently indicating that a PI is only partially disclosed if not in accordance with the guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Although {{there is}} no {{mandatory}} requirement for Italian universities to report beyond a financial report, several universities have produced a <b>social</b> <b>report,</b> despite the context of increasing pressure to cut financial resources. This study aims to investigate if Italian state universities produce voluntary <b>social</b> <b>reports</b> and, if so, what they disclose. Also to explore their motivations {{to do so and}} the main difficulties encountered. Design/methodology/approach - Content analysis is applied to the total pool of Italian universities' <b>social</b> <b>reports</b> obtained. Also, a subsequent online survey was undertaken with preparers of those <b>social</b> <b>reports.</b> Findings - The findings indicate that a <b>social</b> <b>report</b> is not a common practice in Italian universities. Subsequent online interviews and thematic analysis found that a key individual within the university played a pivotal role in developing a <b>social</b> <b>report.</b> In the pool of reports examined, there were few social and environmental aspects disclosed. Also the respondents to the survey highlighted that the main difficulty in the development of <b>social</b> <b>reports</b> was the lack of systematic collection of non-financial information within the university.

In particular, the study focuses on developing <b>social</b> <b>report</b> category and its contents with contents analysis.

The study develops and finds total 6 category and 42 items of <b>social</b> <b>report</b> category and its contents. These are human rights(11 items), workplace/employees(7 items), accountability(10 items), business conduct(8 items), community involvement(4 items) and corporate governance(2 item).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our work}} is to propose the integration of two complementary statements on financial information: the <b>social</b> <b>report</b> and the intellectual capital report. Both are statements of great importance in the current business context. The motive behind our proposal is that, in reviewing the current situation, we observed an overlap in the contents and goals of the two reports. For instance, information of a social nature is {{dealt with in the}} different blocks of analysis of intangibles in the intellectual capital report. Furthermore, these disclosures share the direct or indirect goal of improving the company's corporate image, which also reflects the links between the two types of reports. Hence, given the observed similarities and the greater flexibility and scope of the intellectual capital report, we propose incorporating the <b>social</b> <b>report</b> into the intellectual capital report. The benefits of this will be twofold: a reduction in the direct costs of preparing the report, and a simplification of the non-financial information for the different stakeholders.
