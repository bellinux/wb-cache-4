50|$|Most lights used {{in modern}} {{photography}} are {{a flash of}} some sort. The lighting for portraiture is typically diffused by bouncing it {{from the inside of}} an umbrella, or by using a soft box. A soft box is a fabric box, encasing a photo <b>strobe</b> <b>head,</b> one side of which is made of translucent fabric. This provides a softer lighting for portrait work and is often considered more appealing than the harsh light often cast by open strobes. Hair and background lights are usually not diffused. It is more important to control light spillage to other areas of the subject. Snoots, barn doors and flags or gobos help focus the lights exactly where the photographer wants them. Background lights are sometimes used with color gels placed in front of the light to create coloured backgrounds.|$|E
40|$|In May 1998, we {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} strobe lights for vertically redistributing salmon smolts from {{in front of a}} culvert used to fill a 15. 2 m deep navigation lock chamber in Seattle, Washington. Flows into the culvert during low tides were up to 62. 3 cm/s, with maximum instantaneous water velocities of 1. 7 m/s. We installed ten <b>strobe</b> light flash <b>heads</b> around the perimeter and in front of the north-filling culvert. Fish densities near the culvert entrance were monitored hydroacoustically. Strobe lights were evaluated using paired on and off treatments during daytime (N = 32). In control treatments before fills, most juvenile salmon were within 5 m of the intake floor. With strobe lights turned on, the fish distribution shifted upward, resulting in a 7 -m displacement of the peak densities towards the surface. Mean fish densities at the depth of the culvert (8 - 13 m) decreased by more than 96 % during strobe light-on treatments as compared with control treatments. Based on paired t-tests, mean fish densities in 1 -m strata below a depth of 9 m were all significantly lower (alpha = 0. 05) during on treatments than during off treatments. In control treatments during fills, the distribution of juvenile salmon was relatively uniform, with slightly greater mean densities 8 - 10 m from the surface. During strobe light-on treatments, juvenile salmon were distributed higher in the water column, resulting in a 3 -m displacement of the peak densities towards the surface. Mean fish densities at the depth of the culvert decreased by 87 % during strobe light-on treatments as compared with control treatments. Based on paired t-tests, mean fish densities in all 1 -m strata below a depth of 8 m were significantly lower (alpha = 0. 05) during on treatments than during off treatments. Nighttime tests were also conducted, but nighttime densities were too low for meaningful strobe light evaluation...|$|R
