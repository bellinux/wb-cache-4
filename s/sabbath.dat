5|$|One vocalist whose {{status is}} disputed, {{both inside and}} outside Black <b>Sabbath,</b> is Christian evangelist and former Joshua frontman, Jeff Fenholt. Fenholt has insisted that he was a singer in Black <b>Sabbath</b> between January and May 1985. Tony Iommi has never {{confirmed}} this. Fenholt gives a detailed account of his time with Iommi and <b>Sabbath</b> in Garry Sharpe-Young's book <b>Sabbath</b> Bloody Sabbath: The Battle for Black <b>Sabbath.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{follow-up}} to Black <b>Sabbath</b> titled Scarlet Friday was originally {{going to be}} directed by Bava and star Boris Karloff. This project was never developed. Plans for a remake were announced in 2004 with Jonathan Hensleigh attached to write the script. Black <b>Sabbath</b> has received favorable reviews from critics. In the early 2010s, Time Out magazine conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors, and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Black <b>Sabbath</b> placed at number 73.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Zara Yaqob assumed the throne, the Ethiopian church had been divided {{over the issue}} of Biblical <b>Sabbath</b> {{observance}} for roughly a century. One group, loyal to the Coptic bishops, believed that the day of rest should be observed only on Sunday, or Great Sabbath; another group, the followers of Ewostatewos, believed with their founder that both the original seventh-day <b>Sabbath</b> (i.e., Saturday, or Lesser <b>Sabbath)</b> and Sunday should be observed.|$|E
50|$|Special Shabbatot are Jewish Shabbat days, {{on which}} special events are commemorated. Variations {{in the liturgy}} and special customs {{differentiate}} them from the regular <b>Sabbaths</b> and each one is referred to by a special name. Two such <b>Sabbaths,</b> Shabbat Mevarchim, which immediately precedes a new month, and Shabbat Rosh Chodesh, which coincides with the new month, can occur on several occasions throughout the year. The other special <b>Sabbaths</b> occur on specific <b>sabbaths</b> before or coinciding with certain Jewish holidays during the year, according to a fixed pattern.|$|R
50|$|These {{are four}} special <b>Sabbaths,</b> {{each of which}} derives {{its name from the}} {{additional}} Torah portion that is read that day. Two of the <b>Sabbaths</b> occur in {{the weeks leading up to}} Purim and two in the weeks then leading up to Passover.|$|R

5|$|In {{the sixth}} century, Caesarius of Arles taught {{that the whole}} glory of the Jewish <b>Sabbath</b> had been {{transferred}} to Sunday and that Christians must keep Sunday {{in the same way}} as the Jews were commanded to keep the <b>Sabbath.</b> The Council of Orléans in 538 reprobated this tendency, to apply the law of the Jewish <b>Sabbath</b> to the observance of the Christian Sunday, as Jewish and non-Christian.|$|E
5|$|Shabbat {{lunch is}} also an {{important}} social meal. Since antiquity, Jewish communities all over the world devised meat casseroles that begin cooking before the lighting of candles that marks the commencement of the <b>Sabbath</b> on Friday night, so as to comply with the religious regulations for observing the <b>Sabbath.</b> In modern Israel, this filling dish, in many variations, is still eaten on the <b>Sabbath</b> day, not only in religiously observant households, and is also served in some restaurants during the week.|$|E
5|$|The English {{heavy metal}} band Black <b>Sabbath</b> {{appropriated}} their {{name from the}} film. Originally known as Earth, the group wanted to change their name as another group had the same name. The group saw a local cinema playing Black <b>Sabbath</b> and marveled that people paid money to be frightened.|$|E

50|$|The regular weekly Torah portion is {{not read}} on these <b>Sabbaths</b> and instead there are special Torah {{readings}} {{based on the}} uniqueness of each holiday and the Three Pilgrim Festivals. There are also special maftirs ("additional Torah readings") and Haftarahs (readings from the prophets.) See Haftarot for special <b>Sabbaths,</b> Festivals, and Fast Days.|$|R

5|$|Culturally, Black <b>Sabbath</b> have exerted a huge {{influence}} in both television and literature and have {{in many cases}} become synonymous with heavy metal. In the film Almost Famous, Lester Bangs gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band (plot point one) with the immortal line: 'Give me 500 words on Black Sabbath'. Contemporary music and arts publication Trebuchet Magazine has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece (500 words) on Black <b>Sabbath</b> {{as a means of}} proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject.|$|E
5|$|Dio quit Black <b>Sabbath</b> {{following}} {{a show in}} Oakland, California on 13 November 1992, one night before the band were set to appear at Osbourne's retirement show. Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford stepped in at the last minute, performing two nights with the band. Iommi and Butler also joined Osbourne and former drummer Ward on stage {{for the first time}} since 1985's Live Aid concert, performing a brief set of Black <b>Sabbath</b> songs.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, manager Don Arden invited Gillan to join Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward, all {{founding}} members of Black <b>Sabbath,</b> {{to form a}} supergroup. Although the band had reservations, on 6 April 1983, it was formally announced that Gillan had replaced Ronnie James Dio in Black <b>Sabbath.</b> The group recorded the album Born Again at the Manor Studios in Oxfordshire. Citing health problems, Ward decided not to accompany the others during the subsequent tour, {{and was replaced by}} Bev Bevan.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities {{on the subject of}} God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the <b>Sabbath.</b> According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of Moses and the <b>Sabbath</b> would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E

5|$|Strict Sabbatarianism {{was vital}} to Presbyterian culture. For members of separatist churches, the Sunday {{walk to the}} meeting house, {{sometimes}} as much as thirty miles, marked the intensity of dissent and strict keeping of the <b>Sabbath</b> was a mark of true membership. Fast days were also important, particularly in Seeder culture. They often did not involve actual fasting, but focused on stricter observance of the <b>Sabbath.</b> The established kirk had three a year, but the seeders as many as six.|$|E

Black <b>Sabbath</b> grossed 103.5 million Italian lira on its initial theatrical release in Italy. American International Pictures released the English version of Black <b>Sabbath</b> in May 6, 1964 as a double bill with Bava's The Girl Who Knew Too Much then titled The Evil Eye. The English title of Black <b>Sabbath</b> was chosen to connect it with Bava's previous film Black Sunday. The film opened in France on 17 November 1965 under the title Les trois visages de la peur.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' <b>Sabbath</b> is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' <b>Sabbath</b> is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with their}} third album, Master of Reality, Black <b>Sabbath</b> began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1965, before forming Black <b>Sabbath,</b> guitarist Tony Iommi {{suffered}} an accident {{while working in}} a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.|$|E
