40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to {{investigate}} the library needs and library usage of external students in remote areas. The study emphasised external students' perception of their own library needs. Four distinct areas of research evolved from the {{purpose of the study}}: to identify the library service needs of external students; to identify library use by external students; to identify external students' perceptions of library needs; and to identify student status in relation to library use. Information was collected by an interview with former external students, a questionnaire to the libraries involved in the study and by Nominal Group Technique (NGT) sessions with external students. The primary instrument was a questionnaire to the external students in the population under investigation requesting information of their library usage and needs. The population under investigation were external students enrolledin the South Australian College of Advanced Education (SACAE) and resident in Whyalla, South Australia. It was decided to survey the total population rather than a sample because of the small numbers involved. Thirty-five responses were received out of a population of 52, representing a response rate of 69 percent. The results of the survey were analysed using a Statview <b>SE</b> statistical <b>package</b> and a spreadsheet and graphics package, Excel. Frequency distributions were computed to determine the number of respondents who selected each option. The study found that the external students who used libraries tended to use a variety of libraries. Students used not only their own institution's library, but the a range of libraries accessible to them in Whyalla. The study concludes by identifying issues, recommending possible solutions, and identifying areas for further research...|$|R
40|$|A {{polymeric}} {{protective film}} (I) that is adherable to a substrate comprises (A) a polymeric base that is soluble or swellable in cold or {{hot water and}} (B) a polymer membrane that is insoluble in water but is water vapour permeable. Also claimed are: (i) a process {{for the production of}} (I) by application, preferably by spraying of a solution of polymeric components (A 1) and optionally (A 2) for the base layer onto the chosen substrate with optional intermediate drying and application preferably by spraying of a solution or dispersion of an oppositely ionically charged polymer component (B) and drying of the resulting film. (ii) a process for the protection of interior and exterior surfaces against deliberate dirtying and the effects of air pollution by application of a protection film (I) that is removable using hot water or steam. USE - The combination of substances (A 1), (A 2) and (B) are useful for the protection of interior and exterior surfaces whereby (A 1) and (A 2) may be <b>packaged</b> <b>se</b> parately or together and (B) is packaged separately (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The film (I) offers good protection to substrates against environmental pollution, paint and dyes and is easily removed...|$|R
40|$|Two {{strains of}} Shewanella spp. were {{isolated}} from cod fillets packed in modified atmosphere (60 % CO 2, 30 % O 2, 10 % N 2). One of the strains {{was identified as}} Shewanella putrefaciens. The other strain could not be fully identified but was determined as a Shewanella spp. different from S. putrefaciens. The effect of modified atmosphere (CO 2, O 2) on {{the growth of the}} two strains and on the reduction of TMAO to TMA was studied using solid medium from fish extract packed under variable mixtures of CO 2, O 2 and N 2. All the samples were incubated at 7 °C for 7 days. The Shewanella -like strain was shown to be a stronger TMAO reducer and was more resistant to CO 2 than S. putrefaciens per <b>se.</b> Modified atmosphere <b>packaging</b> of marine fish can inhibit the growth and TMAO-reducing activity of S. putrefaciens when 50 % of CO 2 together with 10 % of O 2 are introduced into the packaging atmosphere. The growth and TMAO-reducing activity of the Shewanella -like strain can be inhibited when higher proportions of CO 2 together with as high as possible proportions of O 2 are introduced into the packaging atmosphere. It is suggested that a combination of 60 - 70 % CO 2 and 30 - 40 % O 2 is introduced into the packaging atmosphere in order to prevent TMA production by Shewanella spp...|$|R
5000|$|G {{development}} {{began in}} late 1993, with design work starting in 1994. A {{design for the}} sedan by Shinji Takashima and Toshihiko Shimizu was chosen in January 1995 and later frozen for production {{by the middle of}} 1995. Prototype test mules were tested from mid-1995 in CD Accord body panels, with full body prototypes being used from 1996. Design patents were filed on 8 March 1996, with development ending in March 1997.For the 1998 model year, the sedan was offered in DX, LX, LX-V6, EX, and EX-V6 trims while the Accord Coupe was offered only in LX, LX-V6, EX, and EX-V6 trims. The DX model was fitted with a 2.3L I4 engine rated at , while the LX and EX included a 2.3L I4 VTEC engine rated at [...] All 4-cylinder models came with a 5-speed manual transmission standard, and with a four-speed automatic as optional equipment. The DX remained the value-oriented trim with no audio system, manual windows, manual locks, no cruise control, rear drum brakes, and 14-inch steel wheels. The DX Value Package added a radio-cassette player, air conditioning, and cruise control; this was known as the Accord DX in Canada where it was the base model of the lineup. The LX trim added power windows, power locks, door courtesy lights and 15-inch steel wheels; an <b>SE</b> (special edition) <b>package</b> available since 1999 added 15-inch alloy wheels. The EX trim added ABS, alloy wheels, keyless entry, rear disc brakes, and upgraded cloth. Leather seating, CD player, and power sunroof were factory installed options for the EX. All V6 sedan and coupe models received a new 3.0L V6 SOHC VTEC engine rated at [...] and 195 lbft Nm (from the Acura 3.0 CL), ABS and automatic transmission. Some dealer-installed options included: gold finish kit, gold finish exhaust tip(s), gold finish wheel center caps, 6-disc in-dash CD changer, tape deck, fog lights, wing spoiler, alarm system, sunroof visor, car cover and accessory chrome wheels.|$|R
40|$|We employ an {{empirical}} {{general equilibrium model}} of the CAP to determine which factors and countries {{would be expected to}} be opposed to or support reform of the CAP. The objective is to determine who the "friends" and "enemies" of the CAP are. The analysis studies the extent to which lobbying activity by these interested parties could be expected to encourage or discourage internal EC reform of the CAP. Several alternative polices to reform the CAP are evaluated in this manner, so as to determine if one or other set of policies has greater chance of being accepted. Specifically, we study the recent MacSharry proposals for reform, as well as the stated negotiating positions presented at the GATT. The result will be a summary assessment of the relative politico-economic acceptability of these reform proposals within the EC. Our results lead to a very simple policy conclusion. Given the <b>se</b> of policy <b>packages</b> considered here, {{there is little doubt that}} the EC is most inclined to adopt the full MacSharry proposal. This suggests that pushing the U. S. or Helstrom proposals is not likely to lead to EC acceptance unless the EC receives significant compensation from other aspects of the multilateral trade negotiations. If one is just looking for a reform package in agriculture that can be negotiated without consideration of other types of sidepayments than the full MacSharry proposal would have to be the favorite from the EC perspective. Without further disaggregation of the analysis to identify the U. S. or Japan we can only note that the full MacSharry proposal is the best of the group as far as overall welfare goes for the rest of the world. Of course, agricultural interests in the rest of the world have strong preference for the U. S. proposal. These results also imply that a negotiation stance that called the EC to implement the "raw" MacSharry proposal without the elaborate scheme of sidepayments that are built into it would be dangerous. It would cause agricultural interests within the EC to change from being supporters of reform to being staunch opponents. Again, in the absence of sidepayments being effected to the EC from other aspects of the overall trade negotiations on non-agricultural matters, one would not encourage dismantling of the sidepayments scheme that is part of the full MacSharry proposal. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} {{educators}} {{have been concerned}} with the decline of physical education in schools. The concern for physical education has been outlined in articles by Alexander, Taggart and Medland (1993), Blanksby (1995), Crowley (1993), Evans (1993), Hickey (1992), Moore (1994) and Tumbull (1995) and was emphasised by the Senate Report on 2 ̆ 7 Physical And Sport Education 2 ̆ 7, which was tabled in March 1994. This report made several recommendations that are of particular significance to physical education and the teacher. The recommendations focus on policy formulation, qualification of physical educators, minimum training levels, provision of support networks, the preservicing and inservicing of staff and the professional development of our educators. One of the criticisms of this report {{is that it is}} primarily based on anecdotal evidence of what is happening in schools. Therefore the purpose of this research study is to address this lack of research by investigating teacher perceptions 2 ̆ 7 of physical education within the K- 6 PDHPE Key Learning Area (KLA) in New South Wales (NSW) primary schools. The study drew information from a stratified random sample of 227 teachers in 37 NSW primary schools across Government, Catholic and Independent school systems. The survey instruments collected data that included the background variables such as gender, age, years of teaching, tertiary qualifications, pre-service training, professional development and teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions and practices in relation to primary physical education. The use of qualitative open-ended questions from the questionnaire provided additional insights into teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions, attitudes and practices as these related to primary physical education in their schools. The questionnaire survey allowed for data to be entered into the Statview <b>SE</b> statistics <b>package.</b> The survey information was analysed statistically for patterns of data, seeking linkages among activities, attitudes and outcomes and drawing informed conclusions. The open-ended questions were transcribed with coded findings used to describe the perceptions teachers have of physical education in NSW primary schools. The findings of this study indicated that the teacher of physical education in NSW primary schools is most likely to be a generalist teacher who has undertaken only compulsory units of physical education during their pre-service education. Many of the teachers reported being dependent on previous personal knowledge and experience or the assistance and support of their peers in teaching their classes. The demographics of the sample highlighted that the primary teaching population is aging and there is a disproportionate percentage of female teachers to male teachers. Teachers emphasised the areas of fitness, games and sports skills and organised sport, while the areas of gymnastics, aquatics and adaptive physical education received minimal attention due to the limited expertise of teachers, legal liability issues and time restrictions. The resources and equipment available to teachers were generally considered adequate in the areas fitness, games and sports skills and organised sport, while those for gymnastics, aquatics and adaptive physical education were judged by teachers to be inadequate. It was the intention of this research study to provide, from the teachers 2 ̆ 7 point of view, a comprehensive picture of physical education in NSW primary schools. The research findings will be supplied to all relevant stakeholders, in anticipation of fixture development and enhancement of the learning environment for students and teachers in NSW primary schools. The recommendations in Chapter Five have been developed to assist the teacher of physical education in NSW schools. The development of a common understanding of physical education needs to occur with the promotion of a physical education model rather than physical fitness or physical activity models. The pre-service education of primary school teachers must include mandatory units which are directly related to the content strands of the PDHPE syllabus, with further opportunities for teachers to specialise in physical education courses. Consultancy support is required to assist schools and teachers to implement the recently released syllabus and documents, with ongoing support on the development of an inclusive whole-school curriculum and focussing on lesson preparation prior to expanding into areas of safety and legal liability. All teachers should be provided with a series of school-based professional development opportunities and the development of an interactive website to enable teachers to expand their range of teaching and learning strategies, with identified groups of teachers targeted to ensure minimal students 2 ̆ 7 experiences across a range of physical education. A minimum standard of facilities and equipment to conduct physical education should be established, so that teachers can fulfil syllabus requirements. Finally all stakeholders need to work in unison to enable students in NSW primary schools to experience meaningful physical education...|$|R
