40|$|Background: Digital {{media can}} be {{integrated}} in tele-monitoring solutions, serving as the main interface between {{the patient and the}} caregiver. Consequently, the selection of the most appropriate digital medium for the specified target group is critical to ensure compliance with the tele-monitoring system. Objectives: This pilot study aims to gather insights from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on the ease-of-use, efficacy, effectiveness, and satisfaction of different types of digital media. Methods: Five off-the-shelf digital media devices were tested on nine patients at CIRO+ in Horn, The Netherlands. Usability was evaluated by asking patients to use each device to answer questions related to their symptoms and health status. Subsequently, patients completed a paper-based device usability questionnaire, which assessed prior experience with digital media, device dimensions, device controllability, response <b>speed,</b> <b>screen</b> readability, ease-of-use, and overall satisfaction. After testing all the devices, patients ranked the devices according to their preference. Results: We identified the netbook as the preferred type of device due to its good controllability, fast response time, and large screen size. The smartphone was the least favorite device as patients found the size of the screen to be too small, which made it difficult to interact with. Conclusion: The pilot study has provided important insights to guide the selection of the most appropriate type of digital medium for implementation in tele-monitoring solutions for patients with COPD. As the digital medium is an important interface to the patient in tele-monitoring solutions, it is essential that patients feel motivated to interact with the digital medium on a regular basis...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate an innovative program of high <b>speed</b> radiographic <b>screening</b> for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) at a large urban correctional institution, Cook County Jail in Chicago.

Sixty-seven cases of active TB were identified by radiograph and 19 others from diagnostic work-up. The case finding rate for active disease with radiographic screening was approximately double the rate previously achieved with Mantoux skin testing. Mean time from jail entry to isolation was reduced from 17. 6 days with Mantoux skin testing to 2. 3 days with radiographic screening. CONCLUSIONS.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the performance of the}} separating system of a self–propelled peanut harvester by analyzing the relationship between a shaking <b>screen</b> and rotational <b>speeds</b> of winnowing.

The sample was prepared based on the yields of an actual self–propelled peanut harvester and analyzed with Statistical Analysis Software after measuring the weight of peanuts and stems. The stem separation ratio was high as 95. 3 % when rotational speeds were 570 rpm (shaking screen) and 2, 020 rpm (winnowing). The peanut loss ratio was low as 0 % when rotational speeds were 370 rpm (shaking screen) and 1, 500 rpm (winnowing). The results indicated that the stem separation ratio was improved with high rotational <b>speeds</b> of shaking <b>screen</b> and winnowing; the peanut loss ratio was reduced with low rotational <b>speeds</b> of shaking <b>screen</b> and winnowing. However, the rotational speed of winnowing did not influence on the peanut loss ratio; as a result, separation performance was improved with low rotational <b>speed</b> of shaking <b>screen</b> and high rotational speed of winnowing.
