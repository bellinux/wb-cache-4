No significant variation in the number of gemmae per shoot was found in Trnndelag.

At maturity the total leaf area, the external leaf area and the volume occupied by the canopy were determined, and the leaf area density was calculated. At the end of ripening, the biomass produced in renewable vegetative organs ?leaves and shoots- and reproductive organs -cluster - were determined. The higher the <b>shoot</b> <b>density</b> was the greater the production of total biomass, due to increased biomass production in clusters. The individual shoot vigour offset the differences in <b>shoot</b> <b>density,</b> so no differences were observed in the production of vegetative biomass due to the <b>shoot</b> <b>density.</b> The increases of vegetative growth and biomass accumulation due to increased <b>shoot</b> <b>density</b> were higher in Sprawl, the not positioned training system, than in VSP, the positioned one. In 2013, with the increasing of the density of shoot, the amount of biomass produced by leaf area increased in both training systems. But in 2014, no significant differences were found. The increase of leaf area density caused by the increase of the shoot number was higher in VSP than Sprawl.

Gags Mycteroperca microlepis reside on rocky reefs {{for most of their}} lives but initially settle and rear in estuarine habitats before moving to offshore reefs. Gag populations have declined to the point where some consider them vulnerable to extinction, and the recovery of the species requires an understanding of what habitats these fish use and why they use them. We examined the habitat selection of juvenile gags in North Carolina using experimental mesocosms. We manipulated the shelter characteristics of habitats and compared the foraging rates of gags to determine the specific attributes of habitats that influence habitat selection. Gags selected structured seagrass or oyster reefs over sand and shell hash habitats. While gags did not show a preference between eelgrass Zostera marina and oyster reefs, they did choose oyster reefs over shoal grass Halodule wrightii and selected seagrass habitats with high <b>shoot</b> <b>densities</b> over those with lower densities.

These species represent various types of architecture and regeneration response to fire. The individual-shoot model is based on shoot emergence, mortality, and elongation given by Richards ’ equation, plus a few simple geometric considerations. Model output is <b>shoot</b> <b>density</b> in each cell of a square grid at several vertical levels. Differences in patterns of <b>shoot</b> <b>density</b> among species are explained by changing a set of parameter values related to growth form and phenology. Vertical distribution of <b>shoot</b> <b>density</b> was calculated from the simulation results and the field data with the purpose of deriving a simpler lumped shoot-population model. This simpler demographic model is based on a projection matrix that predicts the essential dynamics of growth in the vertical dimension. The final and transient behavior of vertical distribution of <b>shoot</b> <b>density</b> are calculated with the matrix model and compared to field data yielding good fit.

Morphometric measurements were carried out at 6 depths between 1. 6 and 9. 0 m in summer and winter at Cockburn Sound and summer only at Warnbro Sound in south-western Australia. The minimum light requirement for P. sinuosa of 8. 5 % sub-surface light was among the lower range reported for seagrasses. Its slow growth rate (0. 5 – 1. 5 mgdry shoot– 1 d– 1), relative to similarly sized species, {{may contribute to the}} low light requirements of this species. <b>Shoot</b> <b>density,</b> leaf area index and biomass showed pronounced and consistent differences among depths (up to 88 -fold reduction of above-ground biomass from shallow to deep sites). At the deeper sites, the reduced <b>shoot</b> <b>density</b> probably reduces respiratory demand and alleviates self-shading. Morphological differences (leaf length, width and thickness and number of leaves per shoot) did not follow a clear and consistent trend with depth. Despite a 70 % reduction in light availability at the canopy level between the shallowest and deepest sites, leaf growth rate was unaffected by depth during summer, and in winter differed between only a few depths. We propose that the reduction in <b>shoot</b> <b>density</b> partially alleviates the effects of self-shading and permits comparable leaf growth rates across the depth range.

Microhabitats may influence the distribution of seagrasses along elevation gradients, but difficulty measuring intertidal microtopography has hindered quantification. Using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), we mapped and monitored a 1. 84 ha study site for three years to understand spatial and temporal patterns of sediment microtopography. We performed high-accuracy GPS surveys and vegetation surveys of a native and an invasive seagrass. TLS provided sub-decimeter scale precision in digital elevation models (DEMs) of the tideflat.

40|$|Three {{strategies}} for controlling Cirsium arvense including (1) repeated stubble tillage with subsequent forage crop cultivation, (2) repeated mowing of a grass-clover ley, and (3) forage crop cultivation following a grass-clover ley ploughed in May/June (3) were investigated in field experiments over 3 years. The development of C. arvense <b>shoot</b> <b>density</b> was regularly assessed on sub-plots with defined thistle densities. In the medium-term (9 months), treatment 1 decreased <b>shoot</b> <b>density</b> and regrowth capacity of C. arvense {{more effectively than}} a mowed grass-clover ley (2). However, after 22 months, treatments 1 and 2 resulted in a similar strong reduction of C. arvense <b>shoot</b> <b>density</b> of 95 % and 97 %, respectively. At this time, the efficacy of treatment 3 was lower (89 %), however, not significantly different to that of treatments 1 and 2. After 26 months, the effect of all treatments was still apparent; however, the efficacy of treatment 3 was significantly {{lower than that of}} treatment 2. Generally, the different strategies showed only minor differences, thus delivering options for optimal strategies of thistle control under given specific conditions of site and cropping systems...|$|E
40|$|The Malta-Comino Channel (Maltese islands, central Mediterranean), {{supports}} extensive meadows of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica that in {{some places}} extend {{to a depth of}} around 43 m, which is rare for this seagrass. To assess spatial and temporal variation {{in the state of the}} deeper parts of the P. oceanica meadow with time, data on the structural characteristics of the seagrass meadow at its lower bathymetric limit were collected during the summers of 2001, 2003 and 2004 from four stations (two stations within each of two sites) located at a similar depth, over a spatial extent of 500 m. <b>Shoot</b> <b>density</b> was estimated in situ, while data on plant architecture (number of leaves, mean leaf length, and epiphyte load) were successfully obtained using an underwater photographic technique that was specifically designed to avoid destructive sampling of the seagrass. Results indicated that P. oceanica <b>shoot</b> <b>density</b> was lower than that recorded from the same meadow during a study undertaken in 1995; the observed decrease was attributed to the activities of an offshore aquaculture farm that operated during the period 1995 – 2000 in the vicinity of the meadow. ANOVA indicated significant spatial and temporal variations in meadow structural attributes at both sites during the 3 -year study; for example, <b>shoot</b> <b>density</b> values increased overall with time at site A; a indication of potential recovery of the meadow following cessation of the aquaculture operations. Lower <b>shoot</b> <b>density</b> values recorded from site B (compared with site A) were attributed to higher epiphyte loads on the seagrass, relative to those at site A. The findings, which include new data on the structural characteristics of P. oceanica occurring at depths > 40 m, are discussed with reference to the use of the nondestructive photographic technique to monitor the state of health of deep water seagrass meadows. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Prediction {{capacity}} of three main shoot population dynamics methods (age structure, net shoot recruitment per plagiotropic rhizome and shoot census) {{have been tested}} {{for a period of}} four years (2002 – 2006) on a Posidonia oceanica meadow. Accuracy of each method was checked by comparing measured and predicted densities {{at the end of the}} study period. Predicted densities came from the evolution of initial densities (measured in 2002) by a basic exponential model of population growth. The exponential model used the different net shoot recruitment rate estimates by each population dynamics method on three depths (upper, medium and lower limit) and three localities at each depth. Predictions performed by shoot census and net shoot recruitment per plagiotropic rhizome methods matched with measured densities at the end of the study period. Conversely, age structure method underestimated <b>shoot</b> <b>densities</b> at each depth, indicating an unreal decrease of shoot population in the meadow...|$|R
40|$|Organismal {{survival}} in marine habitats is often {{positively correlated with}} habitat structural complexity at local (within-patch) spatial scales. Far less is known, however, about how marine habitat structure at the landscape scale influences predation and other ecological processes, and in particular, how these processes are dictated by the interactive effect of habitat structure at local and landscape scales. The relationship between survival and habitat structure can be modeled with the habitat-survival function (HSF), which often takes on linear, hyperbolic, or sigmoid forms. We used tethering experiments to determine how seagrass landscape structure influenced the HSF for juvenile blue crabs Callinectes sapidus Rathbun in Back Sound, North Carolina, USA. Crabs were tethered in artificial seagrass plots of 7 different <b>shoot</b> <b>densities</b> embedded within small (1 – 3 m 2) or large (> 100 m 2) seagrass patches (October 1999), and within 10 × 10 m landscapes containing patchy (90...|$|R
40|$|Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) {{creates a}} dense, {{high-quality}} playing surface and {{is commonly used}} for intensely managed turf areas on golf courses. Its popularity is partially due to its aggressive lateral growth, which allows this species to partially recuperate in areas continuously subjected to wear and divoting. A host of improved cultivars of creeping bentgrass were released on the market that possess improved agronomic characteristics such as vertical shoot growth, higher <b>shoot</b> <b>densities,</b> and narrower leaf blades. While many believe these morphological characteristics create an improved playing surface {{there are questions about}} the ability of these improved varieties to spread laterally compared with traditional varieties. While it is generally agreed that creeping bentgrass possesses relatively high recuperative potential, minimal research has focused on differences among cultivars of creeping bentgrass. The objectives were to determine differences in lateral spread and recuperative potential of creeping bentgrass cultivars in mowed and non-mowed settings...|$|R
