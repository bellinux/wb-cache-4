The report also describes the subsequent review made by Colin Powell and analysts from the State Department with analysts from the CIA.

Or they think of polite cookie-pushers in pinstripes, not the fraud investigators who kick down doors to arrest career criminals or the trainers who are teaching Colombians how to foil the epidemic of kidnappings in that country. And while I would be the first to say we are fortunate, indeed, that people associate US diplomacy with <b>Secretary</b> <b>Powell,</b> we all know the other stereotype, about cookie-pushers, just isn’t true, in the sense that our colleagues, regardless of what “cone” or office they may be in are putting their lives on the line for the American people every day, just like all of you are. In this Department of State family, we have the privilege of working with some of the most talented and dedicated people in this nation and we are all in this together.The pinstriped stereotype is also untrue in another sense. The people who actually execute the diplomacy, the ones who negotiate treaties and write reporting cables, they are actually a very small part of our overall workforce. Approximately 11 percent, I believe. Moreover, they could not accomplish their duties without the other 89 percent. … And you can see clear illustration of this in our top foreign policy priorities of the day: the war on terrorism in general and Afghanistan and Iraq in particular. … ...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores how {{neoconservative}} ideology {{informed the}} Bush Administration’s interpretation/use of intelligence, {{leading to the}} decision to invade Iraq. The Administration based its decision to invade Iraq upon four neoconservative assumptions. The first assumption was that Saddam Hussein’s regime {{was on the verge}} of acquiring nuclear weapons and had already amassed stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. The second assumption was that the regime had meaningful links with Al Qaeda and had something to do with 9 / 11. The third assumption was that, within Iraq, the regime’s fall would be followed by rapid and peaceful democratization. The fourth assumption was that a similar democratic transformation would be precipitated elsewhere in the region. This paper examines primary source documents authored by key members of the Bush Administration (President Bush, VP Cheney, <b>Secretary</b> <b>Powell</b> and Secretary Rice). These accounts are compared to other relevant primary source documents such as the “ 9 / 11 Commission Report” and the “National Intelligence Estimate. ” In addition, the preexisting 9 / 11 ideology held by top officials in the Bush Administration that shaped the decision to invade Iraq is examined.

40|$|The Bush administration’s “war on {{terrorism}} ” has been waged using a {{diverse array of}} military and non-military policy instruments. While the armed conflict in Afghanistan initially attracted the most attention, the anti-terror effort has also emphasized more vigorous intelligence gathering and worldwide sharing of information, new and contentious law enforcement initiatives, and increased monitoring of financial transactions and banking practices. However, the most controversial “weapon ” {{in the war on}} terror is the “preemptive war ” option mentioned almost in passing by the President in a commencement address at West Point in June 20021 and without extensive explanation in the September 2002 document issued by the White House, “The National Security Strategy of the United States of America ” (NSS 2002). 2 Secretary of State Colin Powell, in fact, condemns the Bush administration’s domestic and foreign critics for over-emphasizing the importance of preemptive use of force in the foreign policy toolkit. <b>Secretary</b> <b>Powell</b> boasts that NSS 2002 is a “remarkably candid ” public pronouncement of US strategy, but worries that American policy has been misunderstood and distorted by domestic and foreign critics. 3 According to the Secretary of State, every US President has retained the option of preemptive war t...|$|E
