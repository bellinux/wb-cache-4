50|$|An {{epitaxial}} layer can be doped during deposition by adding impurities to the <b>source</b> <b>gas,</b> such as arsine, phosphine or diborane. The concentration of impurity {{in the gas}} phase determines its concentration in the deposited film. As in chemical vapor deposition (CVD), impurities change the deposition rate.Additionally, the high temperatures at which CVD is performed may allow dopants to diffuse into the growing layer from other layers in the wafer («out-diffusion»).

Silane deposits between 300 and 500 °C, dichlorosilane at around 900 °C, and TEOS between 650 and 750 °C, resulting in a layer of low- temperature oxide (LTO). However, silane produces a lower-quality oxide than the other methods (lower dielectric strength, for instance), and it deposits nonconformally.

5000|$|Ideally, a non-rebreather mask {{would not}} permit air from the {{surrounding}} environment to be inhaled. However, due to safety concerns regarding anti-suffocation protection {{in the event of}} a <b>source</b> <b>gas</b> failure (i.e. the oxygen cylinder being drained completely), one of the two one-way valves is normally removed, allowing inhalation of outside air to a significant degree. However, as almost all non-rebreathing masks are disposable, and manufactured in 1 adult size, most (from decades of clinical observation) do not provide a good seal with an individual patient's face, thus permitting the inflow of large amounts of ambient air (air follows the path of least resistance), and diluting the oxygen provided. Hence, very few patients receive anything close to 100% oxygen. Very high flows (> = 30 LPM) from the oxygen flowmeter are required to partially overcome room air dilution. Further, the larger the patient's inspiratory flow rate, the greater the dilution from air. Very little effort is required by most patients, to inspire at flow rates in excess of 50 LPM (easily seen in the pulmonary function lab with routine spirometric testing).|$|E

In particular, we investigated the effect of source H/C ratio, which is {{the ratio of the}} number of hydrogen atoms to the number of carbon atoms in a <b>source</b> <b>gas,</b> on the deposition process. In the present simulation, the following two <b>source</b> <b>gas</b> conditions were tested: one was that the <b>source</b> <b>gas</b> was injected as isolated carbon and hydrogen atoms, and the other was that the <b>source</b> <b>gas</b> was injected as hydrocarbon molecules. Under the former condition, we found that as the source H/C ratio increases, the deposition rate of carbon atoms decreases exponentially. This exponential decrease in the deposition rate with increasing source H/C ratio agrees with experimental data. However, under the latter molecular source condition, the deposition rate did not decrease exponentially because of a chemical reaction peculiar to the type of hydrocarbon in the <b>source</b> <b>gas.</b> Comment: accepted by Jpn.

Some of these fibers, however, are easily degraded in a high temperature oxidative environment. Therefore, coatings are needed to protect the fibers from environmental attack.

40|$|Long-lived chlorine-containing <b>source</b> <b>gases,</b> such as {{chlorofluorocarbons}} (CFCs), are transported {{into the}} stratosphere where they decompose and cause ozone depletion. Increases in chlorine during the 1970 s- 1990 s resulted in long-term ozone decreases, especially in the polar regions. Following {{the implementation of the}} Montreal Protocol, the near-surface chlorine loading was observed to peak in 1993 and, since then, to decrease in line with expectations. After release from <b>source</b> <b>gases</b> in the stratosphere, chlorine mainly forms the reservoir HCl, providing an alternative method for monitoring the progress of the Montreal Protocol. A maximum in stratospheric HCl was observed around 1996, followed by decay at a rate close to 1 %/year, consistent with the tropospheric chlorine peak and known transport timescales. However, we will present total column observations from ground-based FTIR instruments which show an unexpected and significant upturn in stratospheric HCl around 2007 in the northern hemisphere. Height-resolved observations from satellite instruments (HALOE, MLS, ACE) confirm this increase and show that it occurs in the lower stratosphere. These observations contrast with the ongoing monotonic decrease of near-surface chlorine <b>source</b> <b>gases.</b> Using 3 -D model simulations (TOMCAT/SLIMCAT and KASIMA) we attribute this trend anomaly to a slowdown in the NH atmospheric circulation, causing air in the lower stratosphere to become more aged with a larger relative conversion of <b>source</b> <b>gases</b> to HCl. An important conclusion is that the Montreal Protocol is still on track and will still lead to long-term decreases in stratospheric chlorine. This dynamical variability could also significantly affect the evolution of stratospheric ozone and must be accounted for when searching for signs of ozone recovery...|$|R

40|$|Carbon {{thin films}} were {{deposited}} on Si substrates by microwave-assisted {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) using variable CH 4 levels in an Ar/H 2 (Ar-rich) <b>source</b> <b>gas</b> mixture. The relationship between the CH 4 concentration (0. 5 to 3 vol. %) in the <b>source</b> <b>gas</b> and the resulting film morphology, microstructure, phase purity and electrochemical behavior was investigated. The H 2 level was maintained constant at 5 % while the Ar level ranged from 92 to 94. 5 %. The films used in the electrochemical measurements were boron-doped with 2 ppm B 2 H 6 while those used in the structural studies were undoped. Boron doping at this level had no detectable effect on the film morphology or microstructure. Relatively smooth ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) thin films, with a nominal grain size of ca. 15 nm, were only formed at a CH 4 concentration of 1 %. At the lower CH 4 concentration (0. 5 %), faceted microcrystalline diamond was the predominant phase formed with a grain size of ca. 0. 5 m. At the higher CH 4 concentration (2 %), a diamond-like carbon film was produced with mixture of sp 2 -bonded carbon and UNCD. Finally, the film grown with 3 % CH 4 was essentially nanocrystalline graphite. The characteristic voltammetric features of high quality diamond (low and featureless voltammetric background current, wide potential window, and weak molecular adsorption) were observed for the film grown with 1 % CH 4, not the films' grown with higher CH 4 levels. The C 2 dimer level in the <b>source</b> <b>gas</b> was monitored using the Swan band optical emission intensity at 516 nm. The emission intensity and the film growth rate both increased with the CH 4 concentration in the <b>source</b> <b>gas,</b> consistent with the dimer {{being involved in the}} film growth. Importantly, C 2 appears {{to be involved in the}} growth of the different carbon microstructures including microcrystalline and ultrananocrystalline diamond, amorphous or diamond-like carbon, and nanocrystalline graphite. In summary, the morphology, microstructure, phase purity and electrochemical properties of the carbon films formed varied significantly over a narrow range of CH 4 concentrations in the Ar-rich <b>source</b> <b>gas.</b> The results have important implications for the formation of UNCD from Ar-rich <b>source</b> <b>gas</b> mixtures, and its application in electrochemistry.

40|$|The {{abundance}} of chlorine in the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere increased considerably during the 1970 s to 1990 s, following large emissions of anthropogenic long-lived chlorine-containing <b>source</b> <b>gases,</b> notably the chlorofluorocarbons. The chemical inertness of chlorofluorocarbons allows their transport and mixing throughout the troposphere {{on a global}} scale 1, before they reach the stratosphere where they release chlorine atoms that cause ozone depletion 2. The large ozone loss over Antarctica 3 was the key observation that stimulated the definition and signing in 1987 of the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty establishing a schedule to reduce the production of the major chlorine- and bromine-containing halocarbons. Owing to its implementation, the near-surface total chlorine concentration showed a maximum in 1993, followed by a decrease of half a per cent to one per cent per year 4, in line with expectations. Remote-sensing data have revealed a peak in stratospheric chlorine after 19965, then a decrease of close to one per cent per year 6, 7, in agreement with the surface observations of the chlorine <b>source</b> <b>gases</b> and model calculations 7. Here we present ground-based and satellite data that show a recent and significant increase, at the 2 σ level, in hydrogen chloride (HCl), the main stratospheric chlorine reservoir, starting around 2007 in the lower stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere, in contrast with the ongoing monotonic decrease of near-surface <b>source</b> <b>gases.</b> Using model simulations, we attribute this trend anomaly to a slowdown in the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation, occurring over several consecutive years, transporting more aged air to the lower stratosphere, and characterized by a larger relative conversion of <b>source</b> <b>gases</b> to HCl.

40|$|The {{composition}} {{and structure of}} neutral exospheres imbedded in moving plasmas can be determined by measurements of the velocity distributions of their pickup ion progeny. In turn, the velocity distributions are dependent on the spatial structure of the neutral <b>source</b> <b>gases.</b> Since Titan's neutral exosphere extends into the Saturn's magnetosphere (or solar wind) and well above its ionopause, {{it serves as a}} good place to analyze such characteristics. They are analyzed using pickup ion measurements made by the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) at Titan [e. g., Hartle et al., 2006] and an ion kinetic model. An early version of the model [Hartle and Sittler, 2007] is an expression describing the phase space density of pickup ions, which is derived from the Vlasov equation with an ion source that explicitly accounts for the velocity and spatial variation of the exosphere <b>source</b> <b>gases.</b> The current version used here includes exosphere <b>source</b> <b>gases</b> in three dimensions. A fundamental parameter of the phase space densities is the ratio of the gyroradius to the neutral scale height alpha, = r(sub g) /H. Titan's exosphere structure yields pickup ions whose phase space distributions are beam-like when alpha >> 1 and fluid-like when alpha > 1, peak over narrow velocity and spatial ranges. This beam-like nature makes it considerably more difficult to observe heavy ions because their downstream positions and viewing directions are narrowly constrained.
