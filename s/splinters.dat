5|$|The zduhaći {{of a band}} {{would leave}} their bodies in sleep and gather at an {{appointed}} place, before flying into a battle. They used various weapons, such as spindles, beech buds, sharp <b>splinters,</b> leaves, stalks of straw, fluff, flakes, sand, long twigs, cornel stones, pine cones, eggshells, and other light objects. As believed in Herzegovina, zduhaći uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them. However, the most powerful zduhać weapon was held to be a stick of luč (resinous wood burned to give light or used as kindling) charred at both ends, or any charred splinter of wood. A zduhać who was hit with this weapon would surely die. People therefore avoided igniting the sticks at both ends, and they took care that no <b>splinters</b> were left half-burned.|$|E
5|$|A {{rangefinder}} {{was installed}} on the bridge and her fore and aft holds were refitted as magazines. Half-inch (12.7mm) steel plating was added to protect her steering gear and her interior cabin bulkheads and glass ventilators were removed to reduce damage from <b>splinters.</b> Her furniture was removed {{to make room for}} the mess decks needed to feed large numbers of troops and sailors and an operating room and sickbay were installed amidships.|$|E
5|$|Coalhouse Fort is {{exceptionally}} well-preserved; {{it provides}} {{one of the}} finest surviving examples of a mid-Victorian armoured casemate fort. It has twelve casemates arranged in a semi-circle facing south and east towards the river, with an annexed open battery facing south-west. The casemates are faced with massive slabs of granite and have iron gun ports to protect the gunners from <b>splinters</b> dislodged by incoming fire.|$|E

5|$|Gorgon was {{the first}} to go into action as she bombarded German {{artillery}} positions in Belgium at the end of July 1918. She bombarded the Snaeskerk bridge on 28 and 29 September, but produced a single near-miss. She fired at German artillery batteries again on 14 October, but had to retreat hurriedly when she was straddled by heavy German return fire and she was hit by <b>splinters</b> from near-misses. The next day she bombarded another bridge; the last rounds fired by a Royal Navy warship at targets in Occupied Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The French {{carried out}} seven assaults against the flèches {{and each time}} were beaten back in fierce close combat. Bagration in some {{instances}} was personally leading counterattacks, and in a final attempt to push the French completely back he got hit in the leg by cannonball <b>splinters</b> somewhere around 11:00 hours. He insisted on staying on the field to observe Duka's decisive cavalry attack.|$|E
5|$|Wartime interruptions in {{the supply}} of gas for heating {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} all the zoo's tropical fish and several other animals, including a lioness called Pearl and her litter of cubs. Although Manchester was heavily bombed during the Blitz, the gardens sustained only minor damage. The Scenic Railway was hit by an incendiary bomb and the Reptile House was damaged by shell <b>splinters</b> from ack-ack guns, which also caused the death of a bull bison.|$|E
50|$|<b>Splinter's</b> sons, {{along with}} their new friend April O'Neil, soon become {{involved}} in the conflict with both of <b>Splinter's</b> old enemies, the Shredder and the Kraang. Reluctantly allowing the group to get involved, <b>Splinter</b> appoints Leonardo as their leader and continues to offer counsel and lessons as they engage various foes. Recognizing great sensitivity in April, he begins training her as a kunoichi, and comes to regard her with a fatherly fondness. <b>Splinter</b> ventures from his lair on only two occasions. The first is when he falls {{under the control of the}} Rat King, who attempts to persuade him to forsake his humanity and embrace the life of a rat. <b>Splinter</b> eventually breaks free with the Turtles' help and defeats the Rat King. The second is when Shredder kidnaps April and lures <b>Splinter</b> to his stronghold for a final confrontation. <b>Splinter</b> overpowers Shredder's men and engages his old foe. Shredder reveals that <b>Splinter's</b> daughter, Miwa, had not died and that Shredder had taken her and raised her as his own. <b>Splinter</b> nearly defeats Shredder, only to be attacked by Miwa; Miwa, whose name is now Karai, has been taught, by Shredder, that <b>Splinter</b> is responsible for her mother's death.|$|R

5|$|A third raid, {{consisting}} of six unescorted Hudsons of No. 62 Squadron RAF, flying from Palembang, Sumatra, attacked shortly afterwards, losing {{two of their}} number, with their entire crews, to six Ki-27s. A fourth raid, made up of five Bristol Blenheims of No. 27 Squadron RAF, set off from Palembang later in the day, but had only {{got as far as}} Singapore by sunset, so aborted the mission. Despite claims to have scored multiple hits on both transports and a cruiser, neither the transports, nor any of their escorts were damaged; the former were hit by <b>splinters</b> that killed 8 and wounded 18, but Sendai and the smaller ships were untouched.|$|E
5|$|Beagle was {{assigned}} as an escort for Convoy QP 14 to the Soviet port of Murmansk in April and escorted Convoy QP 11 {{on the return}} trip. The convoy was attacked by three German destroyers on 1 May, but the four escorting destroyers drove off the German ships despite being seriously outgunned. Beagle was lightly damaged by <b>splinters</b> during the engagement. Upon her return, the ship {{was assigned}} to the Greenock Escort Force and escorted convoys between the Clyde and Iceland until October when she was transferred to Force H. She participated in Operation Torch in November, before returning to escort Convoys JW 51A, RA 51, and JW 52 to and from Russia beginning in December.|$|E
5|$|Glasgow {{was forced}} to abandon Monmouth after 19:20 when the German light cruisers approached, before fleeing south and meeting with Canopus. A squall {{prevented}} the Germans from discovering Monmouth, but she eventually capsized and sank at 20:18. More than 1,600men {{were killed in the}} sinking of the two armored cruisers, including Cradock. German losses were negligible. However, the German ships had expended over 40% of their ammunition supply. Scharnhorst was hit twice during the engagement, but both shells failed to explode. The second hit passed through her third funnel and did not explode; she was struck by shell <b>splinters</b> that damaged her wireless antenna array. She suffered no casualties and the only German injuries were two slightly wounded men aboard Gneisenau.|$|E

She served as an aircraft transport between French North Africa and Metropolitan France {{for the first half of}} 1940. In late June 1940, she was transferred from the over-crowded anchorage at Oran to Mers El Kébir. She was lightly damaged by shell <b>splinters</b> during the British attack on Mers-el-Kébir on 3 July 1940, but suffered no casualties. She arrived at Toulon on 18 October where she was subsequently disarmed. In June 1941, Commandant Teste was reactivated as a gunnery training ship.|$|E
5|$|In the Norwegian Campaign, she {{supported}} the Allied landings on 12–13 May at Bjerkvik during the Battle of Narvik. The ship continued to provide fire support {{during the battle}} {{for the rest of the}} month. During the nights of 30 and 31 May, Firedrake helped to evacuate troops from Bodø to Harstad and Borkenes to await further evacuation. She was one of the ships that escorted the troop ships evacuating the troops from the Narvik area on 7 and 8 June. She was slightly damaged by <b>splinters</b> during an aerial attack on 23 May and again on 12 June when her port steering motor and 'A' gun were knocked out of action; her repairs were completed eight days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{founder effect}} is a special case of a {{population}} bottleneck, occurring when a small group in a population <b>splinters</b> off from the original population and forms a new one. The random sample of alleles in the just formed new colony is expected to grossly misrepresent the original population {{in at least some}} respects. It is even possible that the number of alleles for some genes in the original population is larger than the number of gene copies in the founders, making complete representation impossible. When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic make-up far into the future.|$|E

50|$|As {{the second}} season progresses, <b>Splinter</b> tells the turtles about his true {{relationship}} with Karai. He is able, eventually, to convince Karai of the truth about their past, but she subsequently mutates into a snake-like being when Shredder's plan for revenge backfires. Later, Earth is invaded by the Kraang and, in the ensuing battle, much of <b>Splinter's</b> lair is destroyed before <b>Splinter</b> is able to defeat Kraang Sub-Prime. <b>Splinter</b> then leaves the lair to find his missing sons. <b>Splinter</b> again engages Shredder in battle and, seemingly victorious, <b>Splinter</b> prepares to reunite with his sons, April, and Casey Jones, only to be attacked from behind by Shredder and thrown into a sewer drain.

5|$|The {{greatest}} {{evolution in}} dreadnought protection {{came with the}} development of the anti-torpedo bulge and torpedo belt, both attempts to protect against underwater damage by mines and torpedoes. The purpose of underwater protection was to absorb the force of a detonating mine or torpedo well away from the final watertight hull. This meant an inner bulkhead {{along the side of the}} hull, which was generally lightly armoured to capture <b>splinters,</b> separated from the outer hull by one or more compartments. The compartments in between were either left empty, or filled with coal, water or fuel oil.|$|E
5|$|The ship damaged her {{propellers}} on 27 May and {{was under}} repairs at Chatham Dockyard until 4 June, {{when she was}} transferred to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla. She sailed for Le Havre, France on 9 June, to assist in the evacuation of British troops before advancing German troops (Operation Cycle). The next afternoon, she was severely damaged by three hits from German aircraft that knocked out her steering gear. Bulldogs crew was able to temporarily repair the steering gear and the ship reached Portsmouth Dockyard early the following morning. Whilst under repair, she was further damaged by <b>splinters</b> during an air raid on 24 August. Bulldog rejoined the flotilla after her repairs were completed on 2 September.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Splinter</b> - <b>Splinter</b> is the mutant rat {{leader of}} the entire family, {{and serves as a}} father figure for the Turtles. He once was a pet for a renowned martial artist named Hamato Yoshi in Japan. It was from {{watching}} Yoshi that <b>Splinter</b> first learned the art of ninjitsu which he then passes on to the Turtles. <b>Splinter</b> often acts as much as a spiritual guide and counselor to the team as he does their teacher. While he does not wield a traditional Japanese weapon, <b>Splinter</b> carries a cane which he can utilize as a weapon (like a Jo staff) with fierce proficiency. Unlike the previous animated series, the Turtles often refer to <b>Splinter</b> as their father, rather than their master and he refers the Turtles as his sons.|$|R

He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of his lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the <b>splinters.</b> He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed.

5|$|Although Niémen {{was very}} badly damaged, Amethyst was almost {{uncontrollable}} and despite Seymour's best efforts, {{he was unable}} to close with Niémen to ensure her surrender. Dupotet meanwhile was overseeing hasty repairs in the hope of getting away before Amethyst could recover. At 03:45, however, a new ship emerged from the darkness, soon revealed to be the British frigate HMS Arethusa. Arethusa was deployed as part of the force blockading the ports of Northern Spain and her commander, Captain Robert Mends, was a successful officer who had been commended just two weeks earlier for raiding the French-held port of Lekeitio. Mends immediately pulled alongside Niémen and Dupotet fired a single shot each at Amethyst and Arethusa. The shot at Amethyst missed its target, but the one at Arethusa struck the ship and threw up <b>splinters.</b> Mends was struck on the forehead and badly wounded, the only man to be hit. Both Amethyst and Arethusa then opened fire, Niémen surrendering immediately.|$|E
5|$|Although the casemates {{have been}} altered over the years, {{many of their}} {{original}} features survive. None of the guns remain in situ but the metal rails on which they traversed are still in place. The casemates {{were divided into two}} sections. During periods of high alert the gun crews would live next to their weapons in the casemates' rear, an area known as the war accommodation. The front of the casemate was the gun emplacement proper, where the loading and firing took place. The iron shield protecting each casemate was fitted with iron bars from which two mantlets made of thick lengths of rope were hung. These protected the gun crew from <b>splinters</b> and smoke. A loading bar above the gun-port enabled the crew to lift the heavy shells and cartridges up to the mouth of the gun. These were dispensed from the magazines below via lifts {{on either side of the}} emplacements.|$|E

They return to the city as the Turtles face off against Shredder, who outmatches them. The Shredder taunts the Turtles, saying he killed <b>Splinter,</b> causing Leonardo to attack Shredder. Shredder disarms Leonardo, threatening to impale him with his spear unless the Turtles drop their weapons. The Turtles do so, but Shredder plans on killing Leonardo anyway. Before he can do so, he is distracted by <b>Splinter,</b> allowing Leonardo to escape. <b>Splinter</b> then faces Shredder, revealing that he was Hamato Yoshi's pet rat who disfigured Oroku Saki after the latter killed Hamato. Vengeful, Shredder charges <b>Splinter</b> with his spear but he falls over the ledge of the roof after <b>Splinter</b> vaults him with a nunchaku. <b>Splinter</b> tries to spare him, but Shredder attacks, forcing the rat to let go, and he falls into a garbage truck.

They rushed to <b>Splinter</b> while April blew Shredder away with a blast from her mind. Proclaiming that his victory over <b>Splinter</b> is more important to him than even saving the world, Shredder is sucked into the black hole along with his followers and <b>Splinter</b> while the turtles, April and Casey escape Earth's destruction and then in [...] "Beyond the Known Universe," [...] they travel back in time to six months earlier in an effort to prevent this event from happening.
