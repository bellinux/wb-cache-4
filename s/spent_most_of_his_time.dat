Forster was Newcastle's third choice goalkeeper in the 2007–08 season while Tim Krul was on loan at Falkirk, and played {{regularly in the}} reserves. However, in the six years he was signed to the club, Fraser never made a first-team appearance for Newcastle, mainly {{due to the fact}} that he <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> on loan to other clubs, often lasting entire seasons.|$|E

5|$|After renunciation, Tulsidas <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> at Varanasi, Prayag, Ayodhya, and Chitrakuta but visited {{many other}} nearby and far-off places. He {{travelled}} across India to many places, studying different people, meeting saints and Sadhus and meditating. The Mula Gosain Charita gives {{an account of}} his travels to the four pilgrimages of Hindus (Badrinath, Dwarka, Puri and Rameshwaram) and the Himalayas.

5|$|After {{returning}} to his village, Ramprasad <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> in sadhana, meditation, and prayer. Traditional accounts tell of several esoteric sadhanas that he performed, including standing neck-deep in the river Ganges, singing songs to Kali. Ramprasad would regularly practice his sadhana in a panchavati: a grove with five trees—banyan, bael, amalaki, ashoka, and peepul—all regarded as holy in Tantric tradition. He would reportedly spend hours meditating on a panchamundi asana (an altar inside which are interred five skulls–that of a snake, frog, rabbit, fox, and man). According to popular stories he {{had a vision of}} Kali in her form of Adyashakti Mahamaya.|$|E
5|$|Burns {{started his}} cricket career with Cumberland in 1988, but moved to Warwickshire in late 1990.

As a wicket-keeper, his opportunities were limited by the presence of Keith Piper, and he failed to make an impact as a batsman when he was given chances in the first team. He only started to play regularly for the county in 1996, but opted to move to Somerset the following year.|$|E

5|$|In late May 2007, {{following}} the FBI raid, questions surfaced {{about whether or}} not Jew actually lived in his San Francisco home, and whether or not Jew therefore met the residency requirements of his supervisor position. The house in question (on 28th Avenue in the Sunset District) was owned by his father, though Jew's neighbors said that the house was vacant and utility bills showed little to no usage of water or electricity. Jew claimed that he <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> at his flower shop, but was not able to provide more information in response to City Attorney Dennis Herrera's formal requests.|$|E

Smith supported the islands with several gunvessels, including the converted hoys , , and , the fireship , and the Musquito-class floating battery , which he had had purpose-built for the defence of the islands. Lieutenant Charles Papps Price, captain of Badger and an unpopular officer who had repeatedly been passed over for promotion, commanded the British occupation; Price <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> on the islands with a prostitute he had brought from Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war he <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> flying {{throughout}} Europe {{and meeting}} various commanding officers and units. He took advantage of his position to fly other types he had not had the chance to operate. He flew Supermarine Spitfires frequently on such trips. Soon after the Normandy Campaign he took leave to visit his mother in Ireland. She was staying with his sister Mary, (and his niece) who had lost her husband killed in action at Anzio in Italy. He remained with 11 Group until the capitulation of Germany on 8 May 1945.|$|E

5|$|When he {{returned}} to England, he continued to serve both John and John's son King Henry III, but <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> in his diocese. He introduced new administrative methods into the diocese, as well as working to improve the educational and financial well-being of his clergy and to secure the canonisation of his predecessor Hugh of Avalon as a saint in 1220. Although the medieval writer Matthew Paris accused Hugh of being opposed to monastic houses and monks, {{there is little evidence}} of the bishop being biased, and after his death on 7 February 1235 parts of his estate were left to religious houses, including nunneries.|$|E
5|$|After his defeat, McEwen {{remained}} {{active in}} politics, but press accounts said he <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> in the Washington, D.C., area residing in northern Virginia. Since 1997, {{he has been}} a partner with eleven other former Members of Congress in the Washington firm Advantage Associates, a lobbying and consulting firm. He founded FreedomQuest International, an international investment banking firm based in Washington, D.C. McEwen took to the lecture circuit, delivering speeches for $10,000 apiece. During the 2004 presidential election, McEwen traveled widely to speak for George W. Bush, focusing on Ohio. In 2006, he joined the law firm of Greenebaum, Doll, and McDonald as a consultant in its Cincinnati and Washington offices.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preliminary}} hearing in late July, prosecutors presented testimonies from Jew's neighbors at both of his homes, indicating that Jew had never lived in his 28th Avenue house and <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> in Burlingame. Testimony from a U.S. Postal Service inspector revealed that Jew's first-class mail went to Burlingame while junk mail went to his San Francisco address; prosecutors cited utility bills showing low usage of water and electricity at his 28th Avenue home, as well as loan applications that indicated he lived in Burlingame. In his defense, Jew produced a jury duty summons to indicate his address in San Francisco, and questioned the possible bias of the witnesses against him.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to workers, Schindler moved 250 wagon loads of machinery {{and raw materials}} to the new factory. Few if any useful artillery shells were produced at the plant. When officials from the Armaments Ministry questioned the factory's low output, Schindler bought finished goods {{on the black market}} and resold them as his own. The rations provided by the SS were insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} the workers, so Schindler <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> in Kraków, obtaining food, armaments, and other materials. His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers' health and other basic needs. Schindler also arranged for the transfer of as many as 3,000 Jewish women out of Auschwitz to small textiles plants in the Sudetenland in an effort to increase their chances of surviving the war.|$|E

Flying the Me 262 A-1/U5, a six MK 108 cannon prototype, he was accompanied by Major Wilhelm Herget and the non-commissioned officer NCO (Unteroffizier) Franz Köster when the trio engaged American fighters over Riem; Bär claimed one aerial victory. While not flying operationally, Bär <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> giving hasty instruction to the new pilots still being assigned to JV44. With JV44, he achieved his final four aerial victories (3 P-47s and 1 Mosquito) on 28 April, bringing his total to 220. All told, he had achieved 16 victories in the Me 262, making him the second most successful Jet Expert of the war, which he finished as a Lieutenant Colonel (Oberstleutnant).|$|E
5|$|On May 30, 1930, Bacher married Jean Dow. His {{mother gave}} them a Ford Model A {{and the use of}} the family's lakeside holiday house, where they entertained guests {{including}} Paul Ehrenfest and Enrico Fermi. In 1931, with a National Research Council Fellowship, he spent a year at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) because Ira Bowen taught there. At Caltech Bacher attended lectures by Robert Oppenheimer, but <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> at the Mt. Wilson Observatory, which had a better library. Bacher decided to create a work listing the energy, coupling constant, parity and electron configurations of all the known atoms and ions, working with Goudsmit back in Ann Arbor. The result was a book, Atomic Energy States as Derived from the Analysis of Optical Spectra (1932), which they dedicated to Randall.|$|E
