40|$|Acceptance Sampling is the {{methodology}} {{which deals with}} procedures through which decisions to accept or reject of a lot {{which are based on}} the result of inspection of samples. The foundation of the scheme of acceptance sampling has laid by Dodge and Romig (1959). General procedures and necessary tables are provided for the selection of <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> through tangent angle as proposed by Norman Bush (1953). Mandelson (1962) has explained the desirability for developing a system of sampling plans indexed through MAPD. Mayer (1967) has explained that the quality standard that the MAPD can be considered as a quality level with other conditions to specify the OC curve. Soundararajan (1975) has constructed tables for selection of <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> indexed through MAPD and K (pT/p*) Suresh and Ramkumar (1996) have studied the selection of <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> indexed through Maximum Allowable Average Outgoing Quality (MAAOQ) and MAPD. This paper provides a new procedure for designing a <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> indexed through trigonometric ratios, hypotenuse ratios along with decision region (d 1) and probabilistic region (d 2) which is more applicable in practical situations. Numerical illustrations are also provided for the construction and selection of the plan parameters using trigonometric ratios and hypotenuse ratios...|$|E

30|$|<b>Single</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> are {{ubiquitous}} in practically all industries {{and are the}} focus of this article. Double and multiple stage <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> may be less risky in a theoretical sense showing a lower probability of sampling error, however, applications on the shop floor require intensive training and the learning curve is uncomfortably steep. <b>Single</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plans,</b> on the other hand, will reduce costs significantly and even bring a new dynamic to the factory. The elimination of costly 100 % total inspection will enhance the adoption of modern management techniques in general, and help to make negotiations between buyers and sellers more transparent and organized. Our intention is to show how to improve standard <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> like the ISO standards (1999, 1985) by recalculating tables with the hypergeometric distribution, and more importantly taking into account the correct usage of hypothesis testing. All major and most emerging economies have similar standards.

30|$|CV is a {{good measure}} of the {{reliability}} of experiments, that is, the smaller the CV value, the higher the reliability (Steel and Torrie 1980; Taye and Njuho 2008). Recently, Ma and Zhang (1997) deduced the CV method for structural reliability inspection using the CV as the quality control parameter, under {{the condition of the}} CV being known. The inspection efficiency of CV method is higher than S method and σ method. Tong and Chen (1991) proposed a variable <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> using CV to evaluate the quality stability of normally distributed products. Yan et al.

30|$|The {{traditional}} {{sampling plans}} are applied when the experimenter or the producer is certain about the proportion parameter. So, the sampling plans having {{the assumption of}} determined value cannot be applied when there is uncertainty or indeterminacy about proportion parameter. The fuzzy sampling plans have been widely applied for the lot sentencing when there is uncertainty in the proportion parameter. Several authors contributed to designing the sampling plan using the fuzzy approach, see for example, Cheng et al. [2] proposed a fuzzy testing process to select a better process. Jamkhaneh et al. [3] studied the effect of inspection error using the <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan.</b> Sadeghpour Gildeh et al. [4] and Jamkhaneh and Gildeh [5] designed double sampling plan under the fuzzy approach. Turanoğlu et al. [6] studied the characteristic curve of the sampling plan. Jamkhaneh and Gildeh [7] proposed the fuzzy sequential sampling plan. Divya [8] worked on a <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> using the Poisson distribution. Venkateh and Elango [9] designed sampling plan for fuzzy gamma distribution. Kahraman et al. [10] designed the single and double sampling plans under the fuzzy approach. Afshari and Gildeh [11], Afshari et al. [12, 13] designed fuzzy plans using multiple dependent state sampling. Elango et al.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of chain sampling is examined through matching of operating characteristics (OC) curves of chain <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> (ChSP) with <b>single</b> and double <b>sampling</b> <b>plans.</b> In particular, the operating characteristics of some ChSP- 0, 3 and 1, 3 {{as well as}} ChSP- 0, 4 and 1, 4 are presented, where the number pairs represent {{the first and the}} second cumulative acceptance numbers.
