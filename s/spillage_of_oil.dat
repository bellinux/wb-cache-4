40|$|Abstract One of {{the most}} {{critical}} environmental impact of extraction and production <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> industry is the <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> crude <b>oil</b> that causes severe soil contamination. A polluted soil by crude oil at the bank of produced water pit at a studied oilfield has been chosen as a case study area. A typical soil sample has been prepared from a mixing of twenty four contaminated soil samples that have been gathered from the top soil at the bank of produced water disposal pit. Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) has been determined for the typical soil sample. Bioremediation study has been conducted, where the typical sample was divided into five controlled soil cells. Four cells have treated by biosurfactant in a certain concentration (0. 05 %, 0. 5 %), and volume (2. 5, 10 cm 3 /Kg soil). One cell {{has been used as a}} reference.

The problem in the pipeline is the flow <b>of</b> crude <b>oil</b> inside the flexible pipe. The high temperature and pressure <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> flow inside the pipe and the pressure acting from outside of pipe due to atmospheric pressure sea wave flow causes damage to the carcass layer. This may result damage in other layers which results in <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> crude <b>oil</b> in the environment especially under sea which is hazardous. Due to rather complicated wall structure where materials with very different properties are interacting, {{a large number of}} failure modes are possible.

40|$|Forest in {{southern}} California has been evaluating and mitigating {{the effects of}} roads and road crossings on this species. To date, we have closed five miles of roads within toad habitat and have constructed seven crossings to reduce or eliminate {{the effect of the}} crossings on toads. Prior to this effort, most of the stream crossings in toad habitat were unimproved and vehicles drove directly through the stream. This caused several problems for toads: 1. While crossing the stream, vehicles would often proceed to drive up and down the stream, causing considerable disturbance of the stream bed and increasing turbidity in the stream. 2. Vehicles would often become stuck in the stream or hit a rock while attempting to cross the stream, which could result in <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> or other toxic substances into the stream. 3. Tadpoles present in the stream could be crushed by vehicles driving through the crossing. Two different types of stream crossings were constructed to separate vehicle traffic from contact with the streams. The first type was an “Arizona” crossing, which is a raised concrete ford with culverts. This type of crossing was constructed with adjacent partially buried k-rail or fencing to ensure that vehicles stayed on the road surface. The second type of crossing was a precast concrete 93 feet span designed to accommodate a 50 -year flood and to eliminate vehicles from driving 400 feet up of the stream. Our poster will illustrate these two types of crossings.

40|$|In 1990, the US {{adopted the}} OPA 90 in {{response}} to the Exxon Valdez grounding outside the Alaskan coast in 1989. The OPA 90 was the first legislation demanding double hull on oil tankers in order to prevent the <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> in case of a grounding or collision. The IMO adopted amendments to MARPOL 73 / 78 in 1992, which for example required all new tankers of 600 dwt and above to have double sides or double bottom and tankers of 5, 000 dwt and above to have both double bottom and double sides. The Erika accident outside the French coast shook the EU and a stricter regulation, in comparison with the MARPOL, on double hull tankers was adopted. The Prestige accident in 2002 further spurred the EU to put pressure on the IMO to implement the same accelerated phase out scheme of single hulled tankers as the EU had already adopted. This developed into a battle between the EU and the IMO on the jurisdictional right to prevent marine pollution by phasing out single hulled tankers. The thesis is a descriptive and analytical study of the development of the MARPOL and EU phase out schemes. By presenting the relevant UNCLOS articles it is analyzed how unilateral legislation may prevent single hulled tankers by using the jurisdiction of flag, port, and coastal states. The EU has taken an independent initiative to regulate the phase out stricter than the IMO and chapter 2 examines the jurisdiction of the EU in the field of maritime pollution prevention. The study shows that the EU member states may, by using their flag and port state jurisdiction given to them by the UNCLOS, implement the EU regulation. Chapter 3 describes how the MARPOL and EU schemes on the phasing out of single hulled tankers developed. These schemes came about during a process lasting a decade when both organizations wanted to prove their efficiency to respond quickly to the problems of oil pollution. Finally, the EU, after political pressure from the EU member states and the public opinion, had the IMO adopting the same phase out scheme as the EU but with some exemptions. The shipping industry is vulnerable to unilateral legislation since shipping is an international business and EU politicians are not considered to be as competent in the maritime field as experts of the IMO. Therefore, the IMO needs to take the initiative back from the EU on all matters concerning marine legislation. The last chapter analyzes the possible consequences for the shipping industry due to the phasing out of single hulled tankers. The phase out require, among other things, new tonnage to be built and old tonnage to be scrapped. There are many consequences for the shipping industry when new legislation is made and some of them may be very costly for some of the actors in the shipping industry...|$|E
40|$|The ‘early kettle’ {{hop aroma}} of beer is quite complex, since losses, {{chemical}} oxidations {{as well as}} biotransformations <b>of</b> hop <b>oil</b> constituents occur during the brewing process, resulting in ‘hoppy’ aroma in the final beer that is clearly different from the aroma of raw hops. In this respect, oxygenated terpenoids have been suggested {{to play a major}} role, although their behaviour/formation during the brewing process has not yet been fully understood. By performing lab scale experiments, we have proven that sesquiterpene hydrocarbons can be oxidized during boiling into a whole series of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, some of them being highly flavour-active. In order to verify to what extent these findings are applicable to real brewing practice, we brewed a kettle hopped beer and monitored the hop oil compounds from kettle boil up to the cask. Interestingly, after both early and late kettle hopping we observed an increase in the level of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids {{as a function of the}} boiling time. A huge amount of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons was lost during the whirlpool stage whereas the fermentation process led to losses <b>of</b> all hop <b>oil</b> compounds, although the oxygenated sesquiterpenoids were better retained in the green beer. In conclusion, ‘early’ kettle hopping does not lead to <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> all hop <b>oil</b> compounds, as believed by many brewers, but instead provides significant levels of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, that may be key impact compounds for ‘kettle’ hoppy aroma of beer. status: publishe...|$|R

However, {{a number of small}} sites spread out in rural areas end up low on priority lists, andwill not be attended to within foreseeable future if ever. For such areas a low cost, easy toapply remediation techniques would be of interest. Enhanced bioremediation of dieselcontaminants in soil by whey addition has been demonstrated in lab scale. Whey is a byproductfrom cheese production. A first pilot remediation trial on an actual site in Gäddede,County of Jämtland, was started the summer of 2010. Using this site as a case study ascreening life cycle assessment model has been set up. The goal of the study was toinvestigate the environmental performance of the whey method, to benchmark the wheymethod toward the excavation and composting practice and to identify environmental hotspots in the whey treatment life cycle. The study aims at establishing if further work shouldbe put into developing the method, or if the environmental performance is such that the wheymethod should be abandoned. It should be noted that even with a slightly worseenvironmental performance compared to other remediation alternatives whey treatment couldstill be of interest, since the small scale sites in rural areas we talk about here otherwise mostoften would not be attended to. Results from the screening life cycle assessment indicate a rather good environmentalperformance of the whey method, partly depending on impact category considered. For thewhey method, impacts from farming activities in the milk production chain allocated to thewhey give significant contributions. Transportation gives important impacts from both thewhey method and the excavation and off site composting, thus logistics should always beconsidered and optimized. The whey on-site treatment could be an interesting alternative forbioremediation especially at sites that would not otherwise be treated, due to small size orremote location...|$|R
