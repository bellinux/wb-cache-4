5|$|Gradually, the {{hydrogen}} {{burning in the}} shell around the solar core will increase {{the mass of the}} core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into carbon will begin, leading to a helium flash; the Sun will <b>shrink</b> <b>from</b> around 250 to 11times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature will increase to about 4770K. The Sun will become a horizontal giant, burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage will last only 100million years. Eventually, it will have to again resort to the reserves of hydrogen and helium in its outer layers and will expand a second time, turning into what is known as an asymptotic giant. Here the luminosity of the Sun will increase again, reaching about 2,090 present luminosities, and it will cool to about 3500K. This phase lasts about 30million years, after which, {{over the course of a}} further 100,000years, the Sun's remaining outer layers will fall away, ejecting a vast stream of matter into space and forming a halo known (misleadingly) as a planetary nebula. The ejected material will contain the helium and carbon produced by the Sun's nuclear reactions, continuing the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements for future generations of stars.|$|E

25|$|Deployed 800 {{yards from}} the French, these cannons were {{commanded}} by Reisner, Archduke John's chief of artillery. The artillery barrage soon caused serious casualties in the vulnerable French squares. As some French troops began to <b>shrink</b> <b>from</b> the heavy fire, couriers raced off to get help. Quickly, Eugène ordered twenty guns belonging to Broussier and Lamarque across the river. When the cannons arrived, the French formed their own 24-gun battery {{in front of the}} infantry and replied to Reisner's bombardment. Wolfskeel asked for some infantry to be sent forward from the Piavisella line, but for some reason no help arrived.|$|E
25|$|In a probate case Saadia {{refused to}} sign a verdict of the exilarch which he thought unjust, {{although}} the Gaon of Pumbedita had subscribed to it. When {{the son of the}} exilarch threatened Saadia with violence to secure his compliance, and was roughly handled by Saadia's servant, open war broke out between the exilarch and the gaon. Each excommunicated the other, declaring that he deposed his opponent from office; and David b. Zakkai appointed Joseph b. Jacob as gaon of Sura, while Saadia conferred the exilarchate on David's brother Hassan (Josiah; 930). Hassan was forced to flee, and died in exile in Khorasan; but the strife which divided Babylonian Judaism continued. Saadia was attacked by the exilarch and by his chief adherent, the young but learned Aaron ibn Sargado (later Gaon of Pumbedita, 943-960), in Hebrew pamphlets, fragments of which show a hatred {{on the part of the}} exilarch and his partisans that did not <b>shrink</b> <b>from</b> scandal.

25|$|In {{less than}} a year, {{he was out of}} the treasury, but he still {{remained}} by the person of his monarch and was with him in his dangerous passage to Holland in January 1691. He was one of the eighteen peers who signed the protest against the rejection, on 7 December 1692, of the motion for the appointment of a committee to inquire into the conduct of the war, and although William had refused his consent to a bill for triennial parliaments in the previous session, Lord Monmouth did not <b>shrink</b> <b>from</b> reintroducing it in December 1693. This led to a disagreement with the court, though the final breach did not take place until January 1697, when Monmouth was accused of complicity in Sir John Fenwick's conspiracy and of the use of undutiful words towards the king. He was committed to the Tower of London, staying in confinement until 30 March 1697, and deprived of his employments. Some consolation for these troubles came to him on 19 June of the same year, when he succeeded to the Earldom of Peterborough, by the death of his uncle Henry Mordaunt, 2nd Earl.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of Tournai on 3 September (itself a major undertaking), the Allied generals turned their {{attention}} towards Mons. Marshal Villars, recently joined by Boufflers, moved his army south-west {{of the town and}} began to fortify his position. Marlborough and Eugene favoured an engagement before Villars could render his position impregnable; but they also agreed to wait for reinforcements from Tournai which did not arrive until the following night, thus giving the French further opportunity to prepare their defences. Notwithstanding the difficulties of the attack, however, the Allied generals did not <b>shrink</b> <b>from</b> their original determination. The subsequent Battle of Malplaquet, fought on 11 September 1709, was the bloodiest engagement of the war. On the left flank, the Prince of Orange led his Dutch infantry in desperate charges only to have it cut to pieces; on the other flank, Eugene attacked and suffered almost as severely. But sustained pressure on his extremities forced Villars to weaken his centre, thus enabling Marlborough to breakthrough and claim victory. Villars was unable to save Mons, which subsequently capitulated on 21 October, but his resolute defence at Malplaquet—inflicting up to 25% casualties on the Allies—may have saved France from destruction.|$|E

500|$|Charles Bell, in his {{biography}} of Wheelwright, provided a mixed {{assessment of the}} character of Wheelwright, calling him contentious, lacking a conciliatory spirit, and never one to <b>shrink</b> <b>from</b> controversy. In Massachusetts he was to blame for much of the temper and spirit which he displayed, when [...] "by a more moderate carriage he might have mitigated the bitterness of the strife..." [...] However, Bell found him to be neither intractable nor unforgiving, and called him notably energetic, industrious and courageous. His sincere piety was never called into question, even by those with whom he differed most widely.|$|E

500|$|Tucker's form faded {{after the}} All-Star Game; in early July, {{he had a}} hitless streak of 28 at-bats, causing his batting average to <b>shrink</b> <b>from</b> [...]375 to [...]327, {{resulting}} in losing his status as league leader. When his average fell to [...]320 after recording one base hit in 35 at-bats, he {{was removed from the}} starting lineup for a weekend matchup against the Detroit Tigers in an attempt to halt his decline. Tucker returned to the starting lineup shortly after being removed, and finished the season with a batting average of [...]287 and six triples. [...] At the end of July that season, both Tucker and George Case participated in a 75-yard dash as part of the White Sox's annual benefit for the war effort; Tucker lost the race to Case by a yard. After the season ended, Tucker formally joined the Navy, and spent the 1945 season serving in the war.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} year of her life, Austen revised Northanger Abbey (1817), wrote Persuasion (1817), and began another novel, {{eventually}} titled Sanditon, which was left unfinished at her death. Austen did not have time to see Northanger Abbey or Persuasion through the press, but her family published them as one volume after her death and her brother Henry included a [...] "Biographical Notice of the Author". This short biography sowed the seeds for the myth of Austen as a quiet, retiring aunt who wrote during her spare time: [...] "Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives...o much did she <b>shrink</b> <b>from</b> notoriety, that no accumulation of fame would have induced her, had she lived, to affix her name to any productions of her [...] public she turned away from any allusion to the character of an authoress." [...] However, this description is in direct contrast to the excitement Austen shows in her letters regarding publication and profit: Austen was a professional writer.|$|E

[...] In an interview with The New York Times, Long called Roosevelt [...] "cowardly" [...] and the article [...] "venomous", but his main criticism stemmed from the President's status as a [...] "gamekiller"; Roosevelt, Long claimed, [...] "has no sympathy with any brand of nature study except his own." [...] While a number of scientists wrote in support of Roosevelt and his position, Long produced several witnesses to prove his claims; to combat one of Roosevelt's specific complaints, Long provided a statement from [...] "a full-blooded Sioux Indian" [...] who declared that wolves {{in the area where}} Wayeeses was said to live were known to attack prey in the chest. Long also insisted that he himself had come upon the remains of a deer slain in a similar way.|$|E

Derby knew that his [...] "attacks of illness would, at no distant period, incapacitate me from the discharge of my public duties"; doctors had warned him that his health required his resignation from office. In late February, with Parliament in session and Derby absent, he wrote to Disraeli asking for confirmation that [...] "you will not <b>shrink</b> <b>from</b> the additional heavy responsibility". Reassured, he wrote to the Queen, resigning and recommending Disraeli as [...] "only he could command the cordial support, en masse, of his present colleagues". Disraeli went to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, where the Queen asked him to form a government. The monarch wrote to her daughter, Prussian Crown Princess Victoria, [...] "Mr. Disraeli is Prime Minister! A proud thing for a man 'risen from the people' to have obtained!"

It is contrary to the truth, because he himself says: 'I am no more in the world' (John 17:11), and 'The flesh profiteth nothing' (John 6:63), that is to eat, as the Jews then believed and the Papists still believe. It is contrary to the nature of faith (I mean the holy and true faith), because faith embraces love, fear of God, and reverence, which abhor such carnal and gross eating, as much as any one would <b>shrink</b> <b>from</b> eating his beloved son.… We believe that the true body of Christ is eaten in the communion in a sacramental and spiritual manner by the religious, believing, and pious heart (as also St. Chrysostom taught).
