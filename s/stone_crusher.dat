25|$|The mineral {{line was}} built by the Ailsa Craig Granite Company Ltd. in 1909 and ran from the quarry at Kennedy's Nags via the <b>stone</b> <b>crusher</b> near the south foghorn to the Quarry Pier. This crudely {{constructed}} narrow gauge line was mainly horse drawn, although wagons were also moved by hand or hauled up inclines by winding engines. The mineral railway at the quarry end had a least one siding and a mobile steam crane loaded the larger granite blocks into the wagons that were transported to the <b>stone</b> <b>crusher</b> at the Trammins near the south foghorn, smaller stones being loaded and even moved by hand. Wagons or bogies were winched up to the substantial <b>stone</b> <b>crusher</b> and gravity was used to deliver the different grades of road stone to the waggons below that were then hauled by horses to the Quarry Pier via a line that ran {{in front of the}} lighthouse buildings and took a tight right-angled bend to run up the substantial stone-built incline to the storage area in preparation for delivery via sea to the mainland. Curb stones and stone railway sleepers for sections of the Scotch gauge horse-drawn railway from Ardrossan to Doura were also produced.|$|E
25|$|Photographs {{taken in}} the late 19th century show the horse-drawn wagons passing {{in front of the}} {{lighthouse}} and portray the substantial railway incline and storage area. At times the production outstripped the storage capacity and a photograph shows at least three piles of different grades of road stone stockpiled in front of the lighthouse enclosure. The track at the crusher had a siding that ran to the crusher and a set of points that led to the Quarry Pier main line. The Ailsa Craig Granite Company was never a financially sound business and effectively closed in 1928. The course of the mineral line is still evident near the quarries as a linear embankment that ends below Kennedy's Nag. Various artefacts of the quarry enterprise remain, including concrete blocks at Kennedy's Nag and steel and concrete remnants of the <b>stone</b> <b>crusher</b> near the south foghorn.|$|E

25|$|Ailsa Craig had two quite {{separate}} {{rail transport}} systems, one dated from 1886 and supplied coal, oil fuel and provisions to the lighthouse and gas works via the North Port {{and later the}} New Jetty and the other transported road stone from the quarries at Kennedy's Nags via the <b>stone</b> <b>crusher</b> to the Quarry Pier. The Northern Lighthouse Board's tramway had a section worked via a powered cable way that hauled wagons up from the North Port and later from the New jetty. This well-built tram line is largely intact and has a gauge of 3 feet with junction/points at the gas works and a further set of points {{that led to a}} siding that ran down parallel to the gable end of the gas works to presumably collect the coal ash for disposal. The main line runs on down to the lighthouse and its ancillary buildings, taking a right-angled bend to run parallel to {{the southern end of the}} lighthouse buildings block. This section of the line was worked by hand and at least two wagons remain at the site together with a set of spare wheels at the gas works.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the personal exposure to respirable dust and quartz and in <b>stone</b> <b>crushing</b> units located at west of Iran. A size of 40 personal samples and 40 stationary samples were obtained and analysis was done by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results of personal sampling were shown the concentrations of respirable dust exposure level in workers of process, hopper and drivers were 1. 90, 2. 22, 1. 41 times greater than Occupational Safety and Health Administration permissible exposure limit (OSHA PEL). The average value of total dust and respirable dust emission from stationary sources was 9. 46 mg/m 3, 1. 24 mg/m 3 respectively, showing that 13. 8 % of total dust is respirable. The efficiency of local exhaust ventilation (LEV) to control of particles inside of industrial units was greater than 99 %. It is concluded from this research the particulate generated from <b>stone</b> <b>crushing</b> activities contain a significant amount of respirable particle. The amount of free silica in stone quartz is 85 to 97 percent that emission of particles effect to health workers. LEV has important effect in the removal of silica particles in <b>stone</b> <b>crushing</b> units. The worker of hoppers still exposed to silica more than standard limits.
