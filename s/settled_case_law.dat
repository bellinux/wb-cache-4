2500|$|It is {{generally}} <b>settled</b> in <b>case</b> <b>law</b> that jurisdictions in the United States and Canada {{have the right}} to enact breed-specific legislation; however, the appropriateness and effectiveness of breed-specific legislation in preventing dog bite fatalities and injuries is disputed. One point of view is that certain dog breeds are a public safety issue that merits actions such as banning ownership, mandatory spay/neuter for all dogs of these breeds, mandatory microchip implants and liability insurance, or prohibiting people convicted of a felony from owning them. Another point of view is that comprehensive [...] "dog bite" [...] legislation, coupled with better consumer education and legally mandating responsible pet keeping practices, is a better solution than breed-specific legislation to the problem of dangerous dogs. A third point of view is that breed-specific legislation should not ban breeds entirely, but should strictly regulate the conditions under which specific breeds could be owned, e.g., forbidding certain classes of individuals from owning them, specifying public areas in which they would be prohibited, and establishing conditions, such as requiring a dog to wear a muzzle, for taking dogs from specific breeds into public places. Finally, some governments, such as that of Australia, have forbidden the import of specific breeds and are requiring the spay/neuter of all existing dogs of these breeds in an attempt to eliminate the population slowly through natural attrition.|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} {{proposed new}} Copyright Directive {{was released on}} 14 September 2016. It {{has been described by}} EU law-makers as the pillar of the copyright package promised by the European Commission (EC), to be delivered before the end of Mr. Juncker's mandate. In its Communication of 6 May 2015, the EC had stressed “the importance to enhance cross-border access to copyright-protected content services, facilitate new uses in the fields of research and education, and clarify the role of online services in the distribution of works and other subject-matter. ” The proposed Copyright Directive is thus a key measure aiming to address two of these three issues. However it is not without shortfalls. We have therefore decided to publicly express our concerns and send an open letter to the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council to urge them to re-assess the new provisions dealing with mandatory filtering of user-generated content {{in the light of the}} CJEU <b>case</b> <b>law</b> and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In a more extended statement, we examine in details the text of both the explanatory memorandum and the Directive itself. Our conclusions are: 1. A comprehensive re-assessment of Article 13 and Recital 39 in the light of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the E-commerce Directive (in particular Article 15) including CJEU <b>case</b> <b>law</b> is needed, as the proposed Copyright Directive does not expressly address the issue of its compatibility with both of these texts. 2. Recital 38 does not clarify the domain and effect of Article 13. Rather, it creates confusion as it goes against <b>settled</b> CJEU <b>case</b> <b>law</b> (relating to Articles 14 and 15 of the E-commerce Directive and Article 3 of the Infosoc Directive). Recital 38 should therefore be deleted or substantially re-drafted/re-phrased. If the EU wants to introduce a change in this regard it should clearly justify its choice. In any case, a recital in the preamble to a directive is not an appropriate tool to achieve this effect. We hope that this exercise will prove useful for the debate that has now begun both in the European Parliament and in the Council...|$|R

While case law plays an enormous {{role in the}} everyday operation of the Dominican law system, because of the necessity to interpret and apply the “written” law, its legal use is mainly limited to deciding particular cases.

40|$|The {{proposed}} Federal Marriage Amendment {{would raise}} {{to the constitutional}} level the traditional understanding of marriage as the union of one woman and one man. In so doing it would raise to the constitutional level the questions of who is a woman and who is a man. There is currently no <b>settled</b> <b>case</b> or statute <b>law</b> answering these questions. A 1979 Australian annulment case declaring a husband with XX sex chromosomes to be neither a man nor a woman demonstrates the law’s inability {{to deal with the}} physically intersexed. Legal scholars defending the traditional view of marriage cite 19 th century physical incapacity cases as evidence that only the reproductive sex act can consummate a marriage. In retrospect many of the wives in these cases were physically intersexed. Underlying these cases is an understanding that the two ends of the marriage of young persons are reproduction and the lawful indulgence of the carnal passions and that infertility is not sufficient grounds for annulment. Marriage is not about children. In contrast, in the marriage of old persons the partners take each other as brother and sister. Marriage is not about sexual activity. This essay argues that the law cannot present marriage as a fundamental liberty available to every person {{while at the same time}} providing rules that unproblematically classify everyone as woman or a man legally able to marry men and women respectively. Consequently, marriage as a fundamental liberty must be made universal, available to all couples, regardless of their “sexes. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{integration of}} capital markets {{continues to make}} progress and has resulted in both issuers and investors being active in various markets {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. In times of financial crisis, this brings one question to the centre of attention which has not been discussed exhaustively before: in the situation of securities liability to investors in an international context, which is the applicable law to the liability claim? The harmonization of private international law rules in Europe gives rise to new reflections on the problem of international issuer liability. In the United States, on the other hand, the Supreme Court has just ruled for the first time on matters relating to the international application of the US securities regulation, thereby overruling the <b>settled</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> of decades.

The EU line of <b>case</b> <b>law</b> seems to emphasize more the need to promote innovation as evidenced by the “innovation surplus” requirement. However, for countries that are importers of technology where local innovation is limited or nonexistent, the “innovation surplus requirement” would be difficult to meet. Access to existing technology or to patented products would therefore be limited. From a consumer-interest perspective of a developing or technology-importing country, access to technology, in some cases, is more relevant than innovation in the first place. In addition to the discussion pertaining to “innovation” and “access”, the paper takes a transversal approach and shed light on the treatment of IP related issues in selected Sub-Saharan African countries competition laws.

40|$|In 2009, the Supreme Court {{handed down}} several {{important}} decisions on criminal procedure. Perhaps unanticipated at the time, {{two of those}} decisions have been read together by lower courts to reach dramatically different results. The emerging split has been sharp, bringing with it urgent calls for the Court to intervene. Laying {{the foundation for the}} conflicting decisions was New York v. Belton, in which the Supreme Court held that “when a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of the automobile” along with any containers found therein. Following that decision, lower courts regularly upheld warrantless searches of vehicles conducted incident to an arrest after the police had secured the arrestee away from the target vehicle. In 2009, the United States Supreme Court, in Arizona v. Gant, found that these procedures did not comply with the rationale underlying Belton, and declined to adopt the lower courts’ broad interpretations of that decision. At the time the Supreme Court decided Gant, a number of cases were pending on direct review before lower courts based on evidence obtained in compliance with each jurisdiction’s understanding of the Belton rule. Because Gant did not require lower courts to mechanically suppress evidence obtained in reliance on pre-Gant precedent, prosecutors searched for alternative justifications to uphold the admissibility of evidence collected according to these methods. They were able to find the support for their position in Herring v. United States, a decision handed down by the Supreme Court three months before Gant, which significantly enlarged the scope of the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule. In Herring, the Supreme Court held that exclusion is an inappropriate remedy for Fourth Amendment violations caused by the objectively reasonable actions of law enforcement employees. Government lawyers quickly deployed this new weapon in their battles against suppression where police officers obtained incriminating evidence in accordance with pre-Gant precedent. Faithfully following the Herring court’s decree that the exclusionary rule should be used only as a “last resort,” government advocates successfully argued that the good-faith exception should be extended to include a law enforcement officer’s reasonable reliance on the <b>settled</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> of a jurisdiction that is subsequently invalidated. Such rulings, however, have given rise to a growing conflict among authorities, resulting in the disparate treatment of similarly situated defendants. This Comment will argue that courts should continue to expand the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule to include a law enforcement officer’s reasonable reliance on the <b>settled</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> of the jurisdiction that is subsequently ruled unconstitutional. Such a ruling would be consistent with the Supreme Court’s previous decisions addressing the good-faith exception, and logically follows from their rationale. Furthermore, expanding the scope of the exception would comport with the balancing test courts are required to undertake when confronted with questions of exclusion. Finally, courts should not be deterred by arguments that the Supreme Court’s Fourth Amendment retroactivity doctrine precludes application of the expanded good-faith exception. The few courts that have adopted this approach have misinterpreted the Court’s retroactivity precedent and many of the arguments they employ are overstated. Part I of this Comment will examine the historical development of the good-faith exception through Herring. Part II will discuss the split in authority that has come about {{as a result of the}} Supreme Court’s decisions in Gant and Herring. Finally, Part III will analyze arguments for and against broadening the scope of the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, ultimately concluding that the good-faith exception should include a police officer’s objectively reasonable reliance on <b>settled</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> that is subsequently overruled...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The text {{deals with}} the recent case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on the {{directive}} on the retention of data (metadata) by providers of electronic communications services {{for the purposes of}} investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crimes.

Methodology/approach/design – The text was drafted while there was a pending ECJ’s response to the questions referred by two national courts (one Swedish and one British) on the effects of that invalidity decision on the domestic legislation that transposed it.

40|$|Being a {{practicing}} criminal jurist I {{have chosen the}} subject matter of my examination paper from the new field of European Union law. Since 2004, Hungary {{has been a part of}} the European Union, which is regarded as a unified juridical territory of freedom, security and justice. The European arrest warrant is a quick, effective but humane measure of criminal investigation in this common unified territory. Its concept, necessity and application are outlined briefly in the following. Difficulties caused by the simultaneous application of different national laws of Member States may be overcome by the autonomous concept of the European Union law.

Therefore according to <b>settled</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> of the Court the relevant criteria for assessing the criminal act are the material facts and acts understood as the existence of a set of facts and acts which are inextricably linked together, irrespective of the legal classification given to them or the legal interest protected in national level.

The Guidance concretely informs the public about what constitutes unlawful discrimination against caregivers under Title VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
