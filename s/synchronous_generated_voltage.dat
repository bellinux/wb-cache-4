The savonius wind turbine under {{the study was}} designed to convert wind flows with opposite directions, such as wind flows due to the movement of vehicles that could be seen at the isles, into electricity. The prototype wind turbine had both diameter and height of 32 cm and had its shaft connected to an electric DC generator. Two tunnels with input and output wind areas of 1, 980 and 782 cm 2 each were used to increase wind speeds by 2. 5 times for the turbine.
