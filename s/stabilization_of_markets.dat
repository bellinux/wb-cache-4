The 2000 s, when a sharp rise in commodity prices coincided with a spectacular rise in participation in derivatives markets by financial investors or speculators, were no exception. The coincidence of these events with the crash of 2008 led to the inclusion of commodity derivative regulation within the broader framework of new US and EU financial sector regulation.

Considered the [...] "greatest financial panic the country has ever seen", numerous firms all over New England failed, and Davis, Bates & Turner, often had trouble assessing market value and withdrawing loans from the banks. The firm remained active and even put up positive net return on some years during the panic due to their good credit and lack of debt. Due to the overall speculative markets involving whole sale goods, Bates' firm remained cautious when selling and taking out loans for restructuring. News from New York was delivered to Maine stating further banking regulation and overall <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>market</b> prices, which brought the state out of a recessive period into a sustained growth. The news was received by Bates personally when George Bond, declared that loans would be issued by the New York Banks once again.During the recovery consultations between Maine and Massachusetts business leaders, a prominent banker, Homer Bartlett was quoted as famously saying, Who was the strongest man in that meeting to the financial panics?To which the crowd overwhelmingly replied,Bates!

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the impact of non-informative communications on asset prices. An experimental approach allows us to control for the release of non-relevant messages. We introduce the release of messages in standard experimental asset markets with bubbles (Smith, Suchanek and Williams 1988) through a strategy method experiment. We conjecture that a priori uninformative messages can significantly impact the level of asset prices. Uninformative communications may be used by boundedly rational subjects to compute the fundamental value of the asset. In addition, rational agents may anticipate such an effect and adapt their strategy to the messages received. We asked 182 subjects to construct strategies about their action in a standard experimental asset market environment.

On the contrary, the Shorrocks summary index for the periods 1998 – 2004 and 2004 – 2008 reveals a decrease in labour market mobility over time both in Mediterranean and the Central Eastern European countries. In the latter case, following {{the changes in the}} labour market structure for some Central Eastern European countries, a high mobility during the period 1998 – 2003 suggest higher returns to job changes and a less stringent labour market segmentation in the allocation of job offers after the reforms, as reported e.g., in Boeri and Flinn (1999). Conversely, the observed decline of mobility after 2004 – to values “converging” to what observed for the average Mediterranean and Continental Countries (and the euro area, see Macchiarelli and Ward-Warmedinger 2013) – suggests a <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> labour <b>markets</b> in the region, but also a less efficient matching of individuals with jobs, as evidenced by the increase in the probability to remain in unemployment 19. For Mediterranean countries, a lower mobility over time analogously reflects {{an increase in}} the likelihood to remain unemployed over time.

Along with his recognition by the Pope, emperor Kaloyan (r. 1197–1207) acquired the right to mint coins. Well-organized mints and engraving workshops were set up in the mid-13th century, producing copper, billon, and silver coinage. The reform was initiated by Constantine Tikh Asen (r. 1257–1277) and led to a <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> the monetary <b>market</b> in Bulgaria. The Uprising of Ivaylo and the pillage raids of the Mongols in the late 13th century destabilized the coinage, resulting in a tenfold decrease of minting activities. With the <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> the empire since 1300, Bulgarian monarchs issued an increased number of coins, including silver ones, but were able to secure the market with domestic coins after the 1330s. The erosion of the central authorities {{on the eve of the}} Ottoman invasion gave rise to primitive, anonymous, and crudely-forged counterfeit coins. Along with the Bulgarian coinage, coins from the Byzantine Empire, Latin Empire, Venice, Serbia, the Golden Horde, and the small Balkan principalities were widely used. Due to the increase of production, there was a tendency to limit the circulation of foreign coins by the second half of the 14th century.

Ad hoc policy co-ordination ensued as liquidity was injected into turbulent markets and troubled financial intermediaries were recapitalized or reorganized.
