40|$|We discuss two {{observations}} {{related to}} value-at-arisk optimization. First we consider a portfolio problem under {{an infinite number}} of value-at-risk inequality constraints (modelling first order stochastic dominance). The random data are assumed to be normally distributed. Although this problem is necessarily non-convex, an explicit solution can be derived. Secondly, we provide a (negative) result on quantitative stability of the value-at-risk under variation of the random variable. Although reduced Lipschitz properties (in the sense of calmness) may hold true at continuously distributed random variables under suitable conditions, the result shows that no full Lipschitz property (more generally: Hölder property at any rate) can hold in the neighbourhood of an arbitrary continuously distributed variable. Even worse, this observation holds true with respect to any probability metric weaker than that of total variation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a model for {{decision}} making under risk that is capable of predicting empirically observed preference patterns that {{have been found to be}} incompatible with the expected utility model. The model departs from the classical expected utility model by allowing utilities to depend on the lottery. The dependence of utilities on the lottery being evaluated is achieved by restricting the utility measure to a convenient parametric family of functions. The idea then is to use each lottery to determine a specific parameter value thus characterizing the utility function for each particular lottery. The expected value of this lottery dependent utility function provides the overall measure of preference. The model retains the properties of transitivity, <b>stochastic</b> dominance, and <b>continuity.</b> It also permits types of analyses, such as exploitation of basic attitudes toward risk through risk aversion properties, that have been found useful in decision theory. The primary use of our model is in descriptive or predictive research and applications.

40|$|Linear {{stochastic}} {{transport and}} continuity equations with drift in critical L^p spaces are considered. A result of Sobolev regularity of solutions is proved, false for the corresponding deterministic equations. Thus noise prevents shocks for transport equation and singularities in the density for continuity equation, starting from smooth initial conditions. The technique {{needed to reach}} the critical case is new and based on parabolic equations satisfied by moments of first derivatives of the solution, opposite to previous works based on stochastic flows. The approach extends to higher order derivatives under more regularity of the drift term.

40|$|We {{consider}} the diffusion processes defined by stochastic differential equations when {{the noise is}} correlated. A functional method based on the Dyson expansion for the evolution operator, associated to the <b>stochastic</b> <b>continuity</b> equation, is proposed to obtain the Fokker-Planck equation, after averaging over the stochastic process. In the white noise limit the standard result, corresponding to the Stratonovich in-terpretation of the non linear Langevin equation, is recovered. When the noise is correlated the averaged operator series cannot be summed, unless a family of time dependent operators commutes. In {{the case of a}} linear equation, the constraints are easily worked out. The process defined by a linear Langevin equation with additive noise is Gaussian and the probability density function of its fluctuating component satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation with a time dependent diffusion coefficient. The same result holds for a linear Langevin equation with a fractional time derivative (defined according to Caputo[1]). In the generic linear or nonlinear case approxi-mate equations for small noise amplitude are obtained. For small correlation time the evolution equations further simplify in agreement with some previous alterna-tive derivations. The results are illustrated by the linear oscillator with coloured noise and the fractional Wiener process, where the numerical simulation for the probability density and its moments is compared with the analytical solution...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{two main}} {{approaches}} in credit risk are the structural approach pioneered in Merton (1974) and the reduced-form framework proposed in Jarrow & Turnbull (1995) and in Artzner & Delbaen (1995). The {{goal of this}} article is to provide a unified view on both approaches. This is achieved by studying reduced-form approaches under weak assumptions. In particular we do not assume the global existence of a default intensity and allow default at fixed or predictable times with positive probability, such as coupon payment dates. In this generalized framework we study dynamic term structures prone to default risk following the forward-rate approach proposed in Heath-Jarrow-Morton (1992). It turns out, that previously considered models lead to arbitrage possibilities when default may happen at a predictable time with positive probability. A suitable generalization of the forward-rate approach contains an additional stochastic integral with atoms at predictable times and necessary and sufficient conditions for a suitable no-arbitrage con-dition (NAFL) are given. In the view of efficient implementations we develop a new class of affine models which do not satisfy the standard assumption of <b>stochastic</b> <b>continuity.</b> The chosen approach is intimately related to the theory of enlargement of filtrations, to which we provide a small example by means of filtering theory where the Azéma supermartingale contains upward and downward jumps, both at predictable and totally inaccessible stopping times...|$|E
40|$|Bidirectional {{valuation}} {{models are}} based on numerical methods to obtain kernels of parabolic equations. Here we {{address the problem of}} robustness of kernel calculations vis a vis floating point errors from a theoretical standpoint. We are interested in kernels of one-dimensional diffusion equations with continuous coefficients as evaluated by means of explicit discretization schemes of uniform step h > 0 in the limit as h → 0. We consider both semidiscrete triangulations with continuous time and explicit Euler schemes with time step so small that the Courant condition is satisfied. We find uniform bounds for the convergence rate {{as a function of the}} degree of smoothness. We conjecture these bounds are indeed sharp. The bounds also apply to the time derivatives of the kernel and its first two space derivatives. The proof is constructive and is based on a new technique of path conditioning for Markov chains and a renormalization group argument. We make the simplifying assumption of time-independence and use longitudinal Fourier transforms in the time direction. Convergence rates depend on the degree of smoothness and Hölder differentiability of the coefficients. We find that the fastest convergence rate is of order O(h 2) and is achieved if the coefficients have a bounded second derivative. Otherwise, explicit schemes still converge for any degree of Hölder differentiability except that the convergence rate is slower. Hölder continuity itself is not strictly necessary and can be relaxed by an hypothesis of uniform <b>continuity.</b> <b>Stochastic</b> processes, stochastic differential equations, diffusions, finite difference schemes, renormalization group...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} <b>stochastic</b> <b>continuity</b> {{equation}} (SCE) on R^d under low regularity assumptions on the coefficients. This is the equations for the mass associated to an SDE on R^d. In the first chapter Wiener pathwise uniqueness (i. e. uniqueness for solutions adapted to Brownian filtration) is proved for the SCE,. We use Wiener chaos to reduce Wiener uniqueness for the SCE to uniqueness for the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). The method consists of projecting the equation on the Wiener chaos spaces and using the shift effect of the projectors in order to discard the Ito integral. The second chapter {{deals with the}} SCE for flows, following Le Jan- Raimond’s approach. Here we need that the FPE admits a particular semigroup as solution, which is guaranteed by the theory of Dirichlet forms under mild assumptions on the coefficients. Wiener chaos gives Wiener uniqueness (as before) and also existence. Another method of existence is based on filtering a weak solution X of the associated SDE with respect to a certain cylindrical Brownian motion W. In the third chapter, we consider the case of a rough drift. Here a phenomenon of regularization by noise can be observed: the results in the first chapter give immediately Wiener uniqueness for the SCE, while uniqueness does not hold in the deterministic case without additional hypotheses on the drift. We cite an example of this phenomenon. We prove also that, in many cases, strong uniqueness (i. e. Uniqueness with respect to every filtration, not only Brownian filtration) holds for the SCE. This is not surprising since a strong uniqueness result (due to Krylov- Röckner) holds for the SDE. First, extending Ambrosio’s approach, we associate to every measure-valued solution of the SCE a superposition solution N. Then, starting from N, we build a weak solution of the SDE. This correspondence and Krylov-Röckner’s result imply strong uniqueness for the SCE. The last chapter is about a particular class of generalized flows, the isotropic Brownian flows (IBFs). An IBF is a family of Brownian motions, indexed by their starting points in Rd, which are invariant in law for translation and rotation; it can be found as (possibly generalized) solution S of an SCE with isotropic infinitesimal covariance function K. Here we consider K’s driven by two parameters α and η, related respectively to the correlation of the two-point motion and to the compressibility of the flow. Studying the distance between the motions of two points (which is a 1 -dimensional diffusion), we find that coalescence and/or splitting occur, depending of the values of α, η and d. This analysis makes rigorous the results for a simple model of turbulence and shows that this situation cannot be described classically, thus motivating the theory of generalized flows. Finally two appendices recall preliminaries and technical results...|$|E
