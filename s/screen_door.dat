5|$|On May 3, Helen Reed {{is seen by}} the Phantom {{leaving a}} grocery store. At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is {{sitting in front of}} a window in his armchair, if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying. As she uses the telephone to call police, the Phantom breaks through the <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> and shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags herself {{out of the house and}} into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe, but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town to panic, and people begin boarding up their windows.|$|E
25|$|A <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> {{can refer}} to a hinged storm door (cold climates) or hinged <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> (warm climates) {{covering}} an exterior door; or a screened sliding door used with sliding glass doors. In any case, the <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> incorporates screen mesh to block flying insects from entering and pets and small children from exiting interior spaces, while allowing for air, light, and views. The <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> was invented in 1887 by Hannah Harger.|$|E
25|$|The {{restaurant}} {{building itself}} is on a cement block foundation. Its exterior is stainless steel, curved {{at the corners}} fluted and painted with horizontal bands on a steel frame structural system. Windows are rectangular and retractable, high up the wall. A <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> {{on the south side}} is centrally located. All these features mimic those of a rail dining car.|$|E
50|$|Yishun, Pasir Ris and Jurong East {{were the}} first {{stations}} to undergo testing {{as to whether the}} platform <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> were viable for elevated stations. Eventually, installation of the half-height platform <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> started on 26 August 2009 and operations commenced on 2 December 2009. It was the second above-ground station to have half-height platform <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> installed and commence operations, after Pasir Ris. The tests were successful. Half-height <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> have been installed in all elevated stations.|$|R

50|$|The {{station was}} {{retrofitted}} with half-height platform <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> in 2009 which commenced operations on 18 December 2009. It {{was the third}} above-ground station to have half-height platform <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> installed and in operation. Platform <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> were also installed for the new platforms from the JEMP and went into operation on 27 May 2011.|$|R
25|$|The add-on side tent {{underwent}} a complete redesign. The new model (referred to in publicity materials as an Add-a-Room tent or a Motent) superficially resembles the late Split-windshield's framed tent in general shape and colors, but is otherwise quite different. For one, the tent's frame is now external, with the canvas supported by elastic loops and plastic hooks, somewhat like a shower curtain. Instead {{of a single}} opening front panel, there is a zippered <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> {{in the middle of}} the front (side away from the bus) with a small awning flap that can be lowered for wind and rain protection. This tent also features a waterproof floor, and the attachment method on the vehicle side results in a securely closable shelter (i.e., no more gap below the bus floor).|$|E
25|$|This {{variation}} of the patch clamp method {{is very similar to}} the whole-cell configuration. The main difference {{lies in the fact that}} when the experimenter forms the gigaohm seal, suction is not used to rupture the patch membrane. Instead, the electrode solution contains small amounts of an antifungal or antibiotic agent, such as amphothericin-B, nystatin, or gramicidin, which diffuses into the membrane patch and forms small pores in the membrane, providing electrical access to the cell interior. When comparing the whole-cell and perforated patch methods, one can think of the whole-cell patch as an open door, in which there is complete exchange between molecules in the pipette solution and the cytoplasm. The perforated patch can be likened to a <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> that only allows the exchange of certain molecules from the pipette solution to the cytoplasm of the cell.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} double murder, some parents warned their {{children}} about being out late. The second double murder shocked {{the city and}} curfews were set for businesses. The height of the town's hysteria snowballed after the murder of Virgil Starks. The Texarkana Gazette stated on Sunday, May 5, that the killer might strike again at any moment, at any place and at any one. Before, it was normal to leave your house unlocked, but soon residents started locking doors, pulling down shades, blocking windows, and arming themselves with guns. Some people would nail sheets over their windows or nail the window down. Some used screened-door braces as window guards. The next day after Starks' death, several residents bought firearms and locks. Stores sold out of locks, guns, ammunition, and window shades and Venetian blinds. Other items that sold well included window sash locks, <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> hooks, night latches, and other protective devices.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the Kearney attack, there were half a dozen similar attacks (See table), though none of the purported victims were able to provide a clear description of the prowler, and no clues were found {{at the scene of}} the attacks. The first specimen of physical evidence was found on the night of September 5, when Carl and Beulah Cordes of North 21st Street returned home around 10:00 pm. After spending a few minutes in the house they noticed a piece of white cloth, slightly larger than a man's handkerchief, sitting on their porch next to the <b>screen</b> <b>door.</b> Beulah Cordes picked up the cloth and smelled it. As soon as she inhaled, she became violently ill. She described the effect as being similar to an electric shock. Her face quickly began to swell, she experienced a burning sensation in her mouth and throat, and began to vomit. As with other victims, she also reported feeling weak and experiencing partial paralysis of her legs. Beulah Cordes later hypothesized that the cloth had been left on the porch in order to knock out the family dog, which usually slept there, so that the prowler could gain access to the house unnoticed.|$|E
25|$|The artwork was {{revealed}} on September 20, 2013 on Eminem's Twitter account. The cover features {{a picture of}} the house Eminem lived in during his teenage years, although now the house is in a dilapidated state. It is very similar in design to the cover of the artwork from The Marshall Mathers LP; which also features {{a picture of the}} house, but with Eminem sitting on the porch, the windows uncovered and the door replaced by a <b>screen</b> <b>door.</b> On October 25, 2013, the artwork for the deluxe edition {{was revealed}}. The deluxe artwork is a variation of the standard artwork, in which the house is being looked at through a car window. On the internet, there are many other covers. For example, Eminem sitting at the doorstep of the house and on the door it is written, '19946'. In November 2013, the house went up in flames for unknown reasons, damaging the upper portion of the home. As of 2014, the house had been demolished and plans to rebuild are in progress. The deluxe edition comes with two discs, one being the standard album, and the other containing bonus tracks. The discs' artwork is designed after the Detroit city seal and flag, respectively. The album's artwork direction was handled by Mike Saputo, with photography by Kevin Mazur. In December 2013, the album cover was named the tenth best of 2013 by Complex.|$|E
25|$|From {{the ground}} level {{entrance}} {{door on the}} western side of the tower, a spiral concrete staircase with steel tubular handrail winds around a central service duct before arriving in the near-centre of the observation room. Apart from an enclosed toilet in the north-west corner, the observation room is an open space with a central pillar that contains cavities for services that link to the roof level. Fixed angled glazing wraps around the north, east and south sides. A set of recent laminated cabinetry sits below the observation windows along the north-east. Original metal window frames on the western wall are a mixture of mid-point pivoting and fixed panes, while more recent aluminium-framed windows are found in the toilet. Floors are lined with linoleum and a system of suspended ceiling panels conceals the underside of the concrete roof slab. A recent sink and cupboard sits up against the southern wall of the toilet. All original communications equipment has been removed. Access to the external balcony, which wraps around all sides except the straight, western edge, is through a single door in the south-west corner. This timber door retains the original separate <b>screen</b> <b>door.</b> The narrow balcony has a concrete floor and a balustrade made from two tubular steel rails and widely separated balusters covered in asbestos cement sheeting rendered with pebble-dash on the exterior face. The steel balusters pierce the concrete floor slab and are fixed on the underside.|$|E

500|$|In the {{south-west}} {{corner of}} the nave is a choir vestry, which was originally built as a baptistery. Its screen is made of carved oak, formed in 1883 {{from one part of}} the Fleetwood family box pew that was originally situated in the chancel where the choir stalls now sit. In 1883, this pew had been described as [...] "looking like a cross between a railway carriage and the centre piece of a gondola". The wood is carved with emblems of the family including a double-headed eagle, wheat sheaves and a griffin. The <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> comes from the box pew of another prominent local family—the Rigbys of Layton. It has a carving of a goat's head and is inscribed with [...] "AR 1636".|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{had married}} Sara Lownds in November 1965. By {{the time the}} {{basement}} sessions started in Big Pink around June 1967, he had two children: Maria (Sara's daughter from her first marriage) and Jesse Dylan. Anna Dylan was born on July 11, 1967. Both Heylin and biographer Sid Griffin suggest that recording had to move from Dylan's home to Big Pink {{when it became clear}} that the sessions were getting in the way of family life. Domesticity was the context of The Basement Tapes, as Hudson said in The Last Waltz: [...] "Chopping wood and hitting your thumb with a hammer, fixing the tape recorder or the <b>screen</b> <b>door,</b> wandering off into the woods with Hamlet ... it was relaxed and low-key, which was something we hadn't enjoyed since we were children." [...] Several Basement Tapes songs, such as [...] "Clothes Line Saga" [...] and [...] "Apple Suckling Tree", celebrate the domestic aspects of the rural lifestyle.|$|E

The neighbor's dog, Shep comes out of his dog house and barks, and Baby Helen rises with a joyful expression. She takes a piece of a muffin and tosses it through the boxwood hedge separating the two yards. Shep eats the muffin and Helen invites him to her tea party. Shep runs along the hedge and passes through to join her. Helen instructs Shep with her finger and Shep barks in understanding, Helen takes her seat and shares a muffin with Shep. An inter-title announces that a week later, Helen is out on an errand. Helen passes through the hedge and skips down the sidewalk and Shep barks at her. As Helen crosses the street, she is struck by a passing automobile and Shep races to the rescue. He tugs at her dress at the waist and finding that he is unable to move her, runs to Helen's home and jumps against the <b>screen</b> <b>door,</b> barking repeatedly. As Helen's parents are summoned, Shep leads them to Helen, where a passerby has scooped up Helen {{from the middle of the}} street. All three depart and the scene changes to a dimly lit room with Helen laid on a bed, seemingly dead. Her parents watch over her, with sad faces as a doctor inspects her and folds her arms across her chest. Beyond saving, her parents bury their heads in the pillow next to Helen as the doctor pens a note. Then Shep is shown resting against the side of the door in a feeble and sorrowful looking position.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the terms}} {{are often used}} interchangeably, {{platform}} <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> can refer to both full-height and half-height barriers. Full height platform <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> are total barriers between the station floor and ceiling, while the half-height platform <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> {{are referred to as}} platform edge doors, as they do not reach the ceiling and thus do not create a total barrier. The half-screen doors are usually only half of the height of the full-screen doors, but they sometimes reach to the height of the train. These two types of platform <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> are presently the main types in the world.|$|R

2500|$|President Roosevelt died at Warm Springs, Georgia, in 1945. In {{the minutes}} after his death, Fala behaved very strangely. FDR biographer Jim Bishop {{wrote about the}} death scene: [...] "… a snapping, snarling series of barks was heard. No one had paid any {{attention}} to Fala. He had been dozing {{in a corner of the}} room. For a reason beyond understanding, he ran directly for the front <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> and bashed his black head against it. The screen broke and he crawled through and ran snapping and barking up into the hills. There, Secret Service men could see him, standing alone, unmoving, on an eminence. This led to the quiet question: 'Do dogs really know?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 11, 1972, Wanrow's son {{complained to}} Hooper {{that while he}} was at play in the {{neighborhood}} with Hooper's eldest daughter, a man later identified as William Wesler lured them into his house and locked the <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> behind them. [...] The children saw a knife on the counter nearby and fled. [...] Wesler grabbed Wanrow's son and tried to drag him back into the house, but he managed to break free and run to safety. [...] Shortly after the boy made Wesler's actions known, Hooper called the police, who went to her home. [...] The accused arrived at the house, saying, [...] "I didn't touch the kid, I didn't touch the kid."

2500|$|On Friday, May 10, in Atoka, Oklahoma, a {{man walked}} up to a woman's house and opened her <b>screen</b> <b>door.</b> He asked Mrs. Harmon {{if he could have}} some {{turpentine}}, food, and money. Mrs. Harmon told the man that she had very little turpentine and had no money or food. The man then grabbed Mrs. Harmon by the hair and dragged her out onto the porch. He told her that he might as well kill her since he had already killed three or four people and {{that he was going to}} rape her. He then heard a horse galloping towards them and told her, [...] "There comes a man on a horse. If you report this to officers I'll come back and kill you." [...] After the man ran off, the woman took her child with her to a neighbor's house further up the street and reported it to the police. Soon after her report, a widespread search for the man included 20 officers and 160 residents. She described the man as a 5'9-10 white man about 40 or 45 years old, about 150 to 155pounds, with dark hair, and was in bad need of a shave. He carried an open, five-inch bladed pocket knife and was wearing gloves, a faded and worn blue shirt with khakis, and had an old, dirty, dark-colored flopped hat.|$|E

2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back <b>screen</b> <b>door.</b> She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E.
