5|$|Having {{secured the}} Rudd Concession on mining rights from King Lobengula of Matabeleland on 30 October 1888, Cecil Rhodes and his British South Africa Company were granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria in October 1889. Under this charter, the Company was {{empowered}} {{to trade with}} indigenous rulers, form banks, own and manage land, and raise and run a police force. In return for these rights, the British South Africa Company would administer and develop any territory it acquired, while respecting laws enacted by extant African rulers, and upholding free trade within its borders. Though the Company made good on most of these pledges, the assent of Lobengula and other native leaders, particularly regarding mining rights, was often evaded, misrepresented or simply ignored. Lobengula reacted by making war on the new arrivals, their Tswana allies and the local Mashona people in 1893. The resulting conflict ended with Lobengula's torching of his own capital at Bulawayo, his death from smallpox in early 1894, and the <b>subsequent</b> <b>submission</b> of his izinDuna (advisors) to the Company. Violent rebellion to the north-east, in neighbouring Mashonaland, was forcibly put down by the Company during 1897.|$|E

Hákon's response to Scottish aggression was to organise a massive fleet to re-assert Norwegian authority. In the summer of 1263, the fleet sailed down through the Hebrides. Although his forces gained strength as they sailed southwards, the Norwegian king received only lukewarm support from many of his Norse-Gaelic vassalsin fact, Magnús was one of the few who came out whole-heartedly for Hákon. At one point during the campaign, Hákon sent Magnús and some other vassals raiding deep into Lennox. Meanwhile, the main Norwegian force was occupied with the Battle of Largsa famous, but inconclusive series of skirmishes against the Scots. Following this action, Hákon's demoralised fleet returned home having accomplished little. Not long after Hákon's departure and death, Alexander launched a punitive expedition into the Hebrides, and threatened Mann with the same.

It is necessary that email and online transmission options are available to all Uniformed Service members, their families, and overseas citizens and that email and online transmission become the principal methods of sending election materials to these citizens.

40|$|The CourseMarker {{system has}} been used to assess free-response {{computer}} based assessment (CBA) exercises since 1998. The aim of the studies reported here was to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of developing and deploying diagram-based exercises using DATsys, an authoring environment for diagram-based CBA, together with CourseMarker. Postgraduate students constructed diagram-based exercises in four domains. The process of constructing the exercises was captured as an indicator of feasibility. The exercises were then used to assess two cohorts of undergraduate students. Instruments including system submission logs and student questionnaires were used to assess usefulness. Findings indicate that there is considerable potential for the assessment of free-response domains such as diagrams. Such an approach can help students as part of an iterative process of learning by allowing repeated submission of coursework, which may be most appropriate within a formative assessment context. The exercises are popular with students and demonstrate a gradual, though decelerating, increase in marks over <b>subsequent</b> <b>submissions.</b> The techniques are reliable, but further development allowing for alternative model solutions and assessment of the aesthetic appearance of diagrams would increase validity.

40|$|We discuss {{each of the}} {{recommendations}} made by Hochberg et al. (2009) to prevent the “tragedy of the reviewer commons”. Having scientific journals share a common database of reviewers would be to recreate a bureaucratic organization, where extra-scientific considerations prevailed. Pre-reviewing of papers by colleagues is a widespread practice but raises problems of coordination. Revising manuscripts in line with all reviewers’ recommendations presupposes that recommendations converge, which is acrobatic. Signing an undertaking that authors have taken into accounts all reviewers’ comments is both authoritarian and sterilizing. Sending previous comments with <b>subsequent</b> <b>submissions</b> to other journals amounts to creating a cartel and a single all-encompassing journal, which again is sterilizing. Using young scientists as reviewers is highly risky: they might prove very severe; {{and if they have}} not yet published themselves, the recommendation violates the principle of peer review. Asking reviewers to be more severe would only create a crisis in the publishing houses and actually increase reviewers’ workloads. The criticisms of the behavior of authors looking to publish in the best journals are unfair: it is natural for scholars to try to publish in the best journals and not to resign themselves to being second rate. Punishing lazy reviewers would only lower the quality of reports: instead, we favor the idea of paying reviewers “in kind” with, say, complimentary books or papers.

40|$|Using {{experimental}} and behavioral economics methods, my dissertation focuses on culture, diversity and crowdsourcing. The first chapter investigates {{the role of}} culture and institutional contexts on individual behavior and institutional performance. In our experiments, subjects play two distinct games simultaneously with different opponents. Introducing entropy as an empirical measure of behavioral variation in a normal form game, {{we find that the}} strategies used in games with low entropy {{are more likely to be}} transferred to games with high entropy and are less subject to influence by other games. The second chapter studies how Asians and Caucasians coordinate and cooperate with each other differently when their various dimensions of natural identities are salient. In an experiment conducted at two large public universities in the United States, we manipulate the salience of participants' multidimensional natural identities and find that Asians, especially first-generation students, exhibit significantly more in-group favoritism and out-group discrimination when their ethnic identity is salient. However, this significant group bias disappears when their school identity is primed. The third and fourth chapters evaluate the performance of all-pay auctions in crowdsourcing labor markets, both in the field and laboratory. In the field experiment conducted on Taskcn, we manipulate the size of the reward and the presence of a reserve in the form of the early entry of a high-quality submission. We find that a higher reward induces significantly more submissions and attracts higher quality users. However, unpredicted by theory, we find that high-quality users are significantly less likely to enter tasks where a high-quality solution has already been submitted, resulting in lower quality of <b>subsequent</b> <b>submissions</b> in such soft reserve treatments. To directly compare the performance of simultaneous and sequential all-pay auctions both implemented in crowdsourcing sites, we conduct a laboratory experiment and find lower revenue in sequential than in simultaneous all-pay auctions. When the entry decisions are endogenous, individuals are more likely to enter an auction early when it has a favor-early tie-breaking rule compared to a favor-late tie-breaking rule. In addition, in simultaneous all-pay auctions, our data is better rationalized by a risk-aversion model instead of the risk-neutral model...|$|R

The superconducting transition temperature (T_c) decreases from ~ 17 K to less than 350 mK with increasing disorder. The T_c and conductivity at the lowest temperature both asymptotically approach zero as k_Fl tends to 1, indicating a coincidence of the metal-insulator transition (MIT) and the superconductor-insulator transition. Close to critical disorder there is spatial inhomogeneity in the superconducting density of states (DOS) and the superconducting state is governed by quantum phase fluctuations.

Presentations and workshop discussions covered: (1) principles of micro-CT fetal imaging; (2) concordance of findings with conventional skeletal evaluations; and (3) regulatory requirements for validating the system.
