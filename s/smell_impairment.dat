5000|$|Basic {{understanding}} of neuroimmunological diseases has changed significantly {{during the last}} ten years. New data broadening the {{understanding of}} new treatment concepts has been obtained for {{a large number of}} neuroimmunological diseases, none more so than multiple sclerosis, since many efforts have been undertaken recently to clarify the complexity of pathomechanisms of this disease. Accumulating evidence from animal studies suggests that some aspects of depression and fatigue in MS may be linked to inflammatory markers. Studies have demonstrated that Toll like-receptor (TLR4) is critically involved in neuroinflammation and T cell recruitment in the brain, contributing to exacerbation of brain injury. [...] Molecular insights revealed that TLR4 mediated activation of JNK and p38 MAPK critically involved in microglia mediated neuronal loss. Research into the link between smell, depressive behavior, and autoimmunity has turned up interesting findings including the facts that inflammation is common in all of the diseases analyzed, depressive symptoms appear early in the course of most diseases, <b>smell</b> <b>impairment</b> is also apparent early in the development of neurological conditions, and all of the diseases involved the amygdale and hippocampus. Better understanding of how the immune system functions and what factors contribute to responses are being heavily investigated along with the aforementioned coincidences.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} review, the authors try to {{evaluate}} how relevant <b>smell</b> <b>impairment</b> is in patients suffering from allergic rhinitis {{and how it}} affects their quality of life. Smell dysfunction has {{a significant impact on}} the quality of life as it can lead to a wrong choice of food and intake, a reduction in appetite and eventually to weight loss, malnutrition, immunity reduction and worsening of medical illness. Patients with <b>smell</b> <b>impairment</b> are reported to use larger quantities of sugar and salt to highlight flavours, thus worsening their general health condition and increasing the risk of developing diabetes and hypertension...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{discriminate}} {{and respond to}} chemical signals from the environment is an almost universal prerequisite for survival. Here, we report that the scaffold protein Scribble is essential for odor-guided behavior in Drosophila. Previously, we identified a P-element insert line with generalized sexually dimorphic <b>smell</b> <b>impairment,</b> smi 97 B. We found that the transposon in this line is located between the predicted promoter region and the transcription initiation site of scrib. A deficiency in this region, Df(3 R) Tl-X, and two scrib null alleles fail to complement the smell-impaired phenotype of smi 97 B. Wild-type behavior is restored by precise excision of the P element, scrib mRNA levels correspond with mutant and wild-type phenotypes, and introduction of a full-length scrib transgene in the smi 97 B mutant rescues the olfactory deficit. Expression of Scrib is widespread in olfactory organs and the central nervous system. Finally, alternative splicing of scrib generates transcripts that differ {{in the number of}} leucine-rich repeats and PDZ domains...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: to {{determine}} the prevalence of <b>smell</b> <b>impairments</b> and changes in substantia nigra (SN) echogeneicity on TCS in healthy adult population and to evaluate {{the link between the}} two. Methods: 295 subjects – 59 % women and 41 % men, born in 1964 (aged 48, 42 ± 0, 04 at the moment of the study), participating in a population study “Connection between genetic and lifestyle risk factors for chronic disease risks since childhood” were screened for <b>smell</b> <b>impairments,</b> using Sniffin’ Sticks 12 test, as well as for SN echogeneicity changes using TCS. They all underwent neurological examination with focus on extrapyramidal signs and none was found to have PD at the moment of the study. Results: sufficient acoustic temporal bone window allowed complete TCS results to be obtained in 90. 5 % of cases. In 6. 1 % of examined cases unilateral or bilateral enlargement of SN area (hiperechogeneicity) was detected (using the cutoff value of 0. 26 cm²). In additional 18. 8 % of cases SN area was found to be marginal unilateraly or bilaterally (0. 20 - 0. 26 cm²). 24. 1 % of participants had at least mild hiposmia. Changes in SN echogeneicity correlated positively with <b>smell</b> <b>impairments</b> (p< 0. 05). 9. 8 % of participants were found to have both - smell and SN echogeneicity impairments. Conclusions: almost ¼ of the studied population was found to have at least mild <b>smell</b> <b>impairments.</b> In similar proportion of cases hyperechogeneicity of SN was detected. A positive correlation between those symptoms was observed...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{frequency}} and clinical features of drug-related taste and/or <b>smell</b> <b>impairments</b> are currently unclear. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} study was to identify major drug classes associated with taste and smell alterations reported to the Italian spontaneous adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting database. METHODS: The association between drug and altered taste or smell was investigated by case/non-case methodology. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used as a measure of disproportionality. Cases were defined as patients with at least one ADR related to taste or <b>smell</b> <b>impairments.</b> The non-cases included all patients without any ADRs related to taste or smell alterations. RESULTS: According to the selection criteria, 52 [*] 166 reports were included in the analysis. Overall, 182 cases of drug-related taste and/or smell dysfunctions were identified. Statistically significant unadjusted RORs were reported for macrolides (n = 31; 7. 1; 95...|$|R

40|$|Acquired social {{disinhibition}} {{refers to}} a debilitating behavioural syndrome commonly reported after a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is characterised by inappropriate social behaviour, often described as immaturity and insensitivity towards others. These behaviours can have enduring effects on the social capability {{of the individual and}} their relationships with others. However, research into socially disinhibited behaviour after TBI has been thwarted by a lack of consensus in the literature on definition and measurement. Further, although strong evidence exists of an association between orbitofrontal damage following TBI and social disinhibition, there exists no conclusive evidence on what cognitive mechanisms might be responsible for this disinhibited behaviour. A better understanding of what mechanisms underlie this syndrome will enable the development of targeted rehabilitation to improve the social functioning, and thus the wellbeing, of individuals with acquired social disinhibition after TBI. Study 1 of this thesis aimed to validate a new observational measure of socially disinhibited behaviour for use in a population of individuals with TBI. Participants were 22 adults with severe TBI and 21 healthy control participants. Participants were rated by two independent judges on the appropriateness of their social behaviour in a structured interview with an experimenter. Further, the disinhibition domain of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-D) and the interpersonal relationships subscale of the Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale (SPRS-IR) were completed by someone close to the individual with TBI. Results demonstrated good inter-rater absolute agreement for the social disinhibition ratings. Participants with TBI were rated as significantly more disinhibited than control participants. Further, these ratings were positively correlated with the frequency of disinhibited behaviour and with the level of distress caused by these behaviours as reported by a close other on the NPI-D. Thus, Study 1 demonstrated good inter-rater reliability and construct validity of the new objective observational measure, evidencing the usefulness of this measure for detecting social disinhibition after TBI. However, the social disinhibition ratings were not related to informant-reported change in employment or in interpersonal relationships on the SPRS. As such, social disinhibition observed in the laboratory did not predict social and vocational outcome as reported by close others. 	Study 2 aimed to determine whether <b>smell</b> <b>impairment</b> could predict social disinhibition after TBI, since it has been suggested in the literature that <b>smell</b> <b>impairment</b> can act as an indicator of orbitofrontal damage following TBI. The Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) and the observational measure of social disinhibition developed in Study 1 was completed by 23 individuals with severe TBI and 15 controls matched for age and years of education. Further, the disinhibition domain of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-D) and the interpersonal relationships subscale of the Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale (SPRS-IR) were completed by a close other of the individual with TBI. Results showed that BSIT scores predicted informant-reported change in interpersonal relationships on the SPRS-IR but did not predict disinhibition, whether reported by an informant or observed in the laboratory. While these results do support previous claims that <b>smell</b> <b>impairment</b> has prognostic significance following TBI, no evidence was found for a relationship between <b>smell</b> <b>impairment</b> and social disinhibition specifically. It was concluded that <b>smell</b> <b>impairment</b> may indicate frontal damage broadly, but not orbitofrontal damage specifically. 	Study 3 aimed to determine whether emotion perception deficits play a role in social disinhibition following TBI. Further, this study aimed to extend upon previous inconclusive literature by improving measurement of emotion perception. This study was the first to assess the relationship between emotion perception and social disinhibition specifically, rather than social competence more broadly. An emotion labelling task and an emotion intensity rating task, as well as the observational measure of social disinhibition, were completed by 23 individuals with severe TBI. The interpersonal relationships subscale of the Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale (SPRS-IR) was completed by a close other. Fifteen control participants provided norms against which to assess performance on the emotion perception tasks. Results showed that while participants with TBI were impaired in terms of accuracy scores on both emotion perceptions tasks, intensity ratings did not differ between groups. This suggested that people with TBI are not actually impaired at detecting intensity of emotion but are less likely to perceive the target emotion as the dominant emotion. Further, emotion perception was not related to disinhibition or change in interpersonal relationships. It was concluded that emotion perception impairment measured by standardised tasks {{does not appear to be}} an important factor in interpersonal outcomes broadly, or in disinhibited behaviour specifically. Finally, Study 4 aimed to determine whether reversal learning impairments might play a role in social disinhibition after TBI. Reversal learning impairment refers to the inability to flexibly adjust behaviour when reinforcement contingencies in the environment change. Further, the study aimed to determine whether feedback-related negativity (FRN), reflecting reward prediction error signals, were associated with social disinhibition. The number of reversal errors on a social and a non-social reversal learning task and the FRN associated with these errors were examined for 21 participants with TBI and 21 control participants matched for age. Participants with TBI were also divided into low and high disinhibition groups based on ratings on the observational measure of social disinhibition. Results showed that participants with TBI made more reversal errors than control participants. Further, participants with TBI high on social disinhibition made more social reversal errors than did those low on social disinhibition. Finally, although participants with TBI did produce smaller FRN’s than control participants, FRN amplitude was not related to disinhibition. These results suggest that impairment in the ability to update behaviour when social reinforcement contingencies change plays a role in social disinhibition after TBI. Further, the social reversal learning task used in this study may be a useful neuropsychological tool for detecting susceptibility to acquired social disinhibition following TBI. Finally, that the FRN amplitude was not associated with social disinhibition suggests that reward prediction error signals are not critical for behavioural adaptation in the social domain. 	This empirical investigation adds significantly to the literature by providing a novel objective measure of social disinhibition and an improved understanding of the mechanisms which underlie socially disinhibited behaviour after TBI. Specifically, the findings of this thesis suggest that it is not the inability to perceive social cues, but rather the inability to flexibly change behaviour based on those cues, that underlies social disinhibition...|$|E
40|$|Smoke-induced {{upper airway}} damage and Parkinson's disease (PD) can be {{considered}} independent risk factors for <b>smell</b> <b>impairment.</b> Interestingly, cigarette smoking has been strongly associated with reduced risk of PD and, therefore, has been suggested to have neuroprotective effects. Our pilot study aimed to evaluate the relationship between smoking and olfaction in PD patients and matched controls. Sixty-eight PD patients and 61 healthy controls were categorized in relation to PD diagnosis and current smoking status, and evaluated {{by means of the}} Italian version of the University of Pennsylvania 40 -item Smell Identification Test (UPSIT- 40). ANOVA analysis with post-hoc Bonferroni correction showed that non-smoker controls presented a higher UPSIT- 40 total score than smoker controls (p< 0. 001), non-smoker PD patients (p< 0. 001) and smoker PD patients (p< 0. 001). In this view, smoking seems to affect olfaction in controls but not in PD patients, and {{no significant differences were found}} when comparing smoker controls, smoker PD patients and non-smoker PD patients. Several epidemiological studies showed a negative effect of smoking on olfaction in the general population. Otherwise the sense of smell is similar in smoker and non-smoker PD patients. These results suggest that PD and smoking are not independent risk factors for impairment of sense of smell, but they might variably interact...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} olfaction {{in general}} population, prevalence of olfactory dysfunction and related risk factors. Design: Cross-sectional population-based survey, distributing four microencapsulated odorants (rose, banana, musk and gas) and two self-administered questionnaires (odour description; epidemiology/health status). Setting: The survey was distributed to general population through a bilingual (Catalan, Spanish) newspaper in Catalonia (Spain), on December 2003. Participants: Newspaper readers {{of all ages}} and gender; 9348 surveys were analysed from the 10 783 returned. Main outcome measures: Characteristics of surveyed population, olfaction by age and gender, smell self-perception and <b>smell</b> <b>impairment</b> risk factors. Terms normosmia, hyposmia and anosmia were used when participants detected, recognised or identified all four, one to three or none of the odours, respectively. Results: Survey profile was a 43 -year-old woman with medium-high educational level, living in a city. Olfaction was considered normal in 80. 6 % (detection), 56 % (recognition/memory) and 50. 7 % (identification). Prevalence of smell dysfunction was 19. 4 % for detection (0. 3 % anosmia, 19. 1 % hyposmia), 43. 5 % for recognition (0. 2 % anosmia, 43. 3 % hyposmia) and 48. 8 % for identification (0. 8 % anosmia, 48 % hyposmia). Olfaction was worse (p< 0. 0001) in men than in women through all ages. There was a significant age-related smell detection decline however smell recognition and identification increased up to fourth decade and declined after the sixth decade of life. Risk factors for anosmia were: male gender, loss of smell history and poor olfactory self-perception for detection; low educational level, poor self-perception and pregnancy for recognition; and older age, poor self-perception and history of head trauma and loss of smell for identification. Smoking and exposure to noxious substances were mild protective factors for smell recognition. Conclusions: Sense of smell in women is better than in men suggesting a learning process during life with deterioration in older ages. Poor self-perception, history of smell loss, head trauma and pregnancy are potential risk factors for olfactory disorders.

40|$|Background: Hereditary {{angioedema}} (HAE) is an autosomal-dominant disorder {{resulting from}} C 1 -inhibitor (C 1 INH) deficiency. <b>Smell</b> <b>impairments</b> {{were found in}} patients affected with systemic lupus erythematosus, that, similarly to HAE, {{is characterized by the}} activation of the classical complement pathway with C 4 consumption. In this study, we aimed at evaluating the sense of smell in patients with HAE. Methods: Thirty patients with HAE and 30 healthy age- and sex-matched controls were evaluated for olfactory functions using the 3 -stages Sniffin’-Sticks kit (threshold, discrimination, and identification [TDI]). TDI scores were analyzed according to complement levels (C 1 INH, C 3, C 4 and CH 50), Beck depression inventory (BDI-II) and danazol treatment. Results: A significant decrease in olfactory function was observed in patients affected with HAE compared with controls in total TDI score (P < 0. 001), and in the discrimination (P < 0. 001) and identification scores (P = 0. 012). Anosmia was present only in patients with HAE (3. 3 %) who also exhibited more frequently hyposmia (53. 3 %vs 3. 3 %, P < 0. 0001). Complement levels were reduced in patients with HAE. C 4 serum levels showed positive correlation with total TDI score (P < 0. 001), and with discrimination (P = 0. 002) and identification (P = 0. 011) scores. CH 50 complement levels showed positive correlation with total TDI score (P < 0. 001), and with threshold (P = 0. 002) and discrimination (P = 0. 011) scores. Sex, age, danazol treatment, BDI-II scores were not different between the patients and controls and did not influence TDI scores significantly. Conclusion: Evidence for an impaired sense of smell was found in patients with HAE. The reduction in olfactory function in these cases seems to correlate with complement C 4 and CH 50 levels. Immune and genetic mechanisms might play a role in this defect...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Nasal polyps are {{a common}} disease, the {{etiology}} and pathogenesis of which are still unclear. For diagnosis, a nasal endoscope is essential, while for follow-up treatment, a reliable score system is necessary. The existing score systems consist of few score steps and measure only large changes in polyp size. The question is whether a score system with a continuous scale will provide more reproducible, and sensitive results. The epidemiology of nasal polyps {{in the general population}} is not known. The main aims of this work were; to develop a sensitive and reliable method for assessing the size and extension of nasal polyps, and to determine the prevalence of nasal polyps in a general population. Methods: Different score systems, three newly developed and two established, were compared with regard to their ability to assess polyp size and detect changes during medical treatment. A total of 150 adult patients with nasal polyps were investigated in these studies. The new score systems used were: lateral imaging (LI), assessment of polyp obstruction, and nasal airway patency. The established score systems were ad modum Lildholdt et al. and ad modum Lund and Mackay. The score systems were compared with the patients' subjective symptoms. A nasal endoscope was used to get a good view of polyps in the entire nasal cavity. One investigator examined the patients twice, whereafter three otorhinolaryngologists examined 30 patients independently of each other, using the same technique and performing the investigations under the same conditions. Thereafter, the different methods of polyp staging were compared. The sensitivity of LI in comparison with the Lildholdt et al. score system was tested by measuring early (i. e., within 14 days), and small, changes in polyp size during treatment with a topical corticosteroid. In the epidemiological study, 1, 900 adult subjects were randomly drawn from a small town register. Of these, 1, 387 were examined with a nasal endoscope, tested for <b>smell</b> <b>impairment,</b> and questioned with regard to relevant medical conditions. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) was investigated among individuals diagnosed with nasal polyps and compared with that of individuals without nasal polyps and patients with symptomatic nasal polyps. Results: The reproducibility of all five score systems was good and the reliability between different investigators was significantly better for score systems LI, Lildholdt et al., and assessment of polyp obstruction than for the other two. The LI was significantly more sensitive and better able than the Lildholdt et al. score system to detect early changes in polyp size. The symptom score showed significant improvement after 3 days. The prevalence of nasal polyps in adults was 2. 7 %, and was more frequent among men and asthmatics, as well as with increasing age. The individuals with nasal polyps experienced the same frequency of asthma and reduced sense of smell as patients, and had impaired HRQL. Conclusion: Lateral imaging, evaluated by nasal endoscopy, has been shown to have good reproducibility and to be a reliable method for detecting early changes in polyp size. The prevalence of nasal polyps was 2. 7 % in the general adult population studied. Nasal polyps lead to reduced HRQL.

Includes bibliographical references. General introduction [...] Paper one: An exploratory study of the neuropsychological characteristics associated with olfactory hallucinations in schizophrenia [...] Paper two: Source monitoring and olfactory hallucinations in schizophreniaPurpose: The primary aim {{of this research was}} to address the current gap in knowledge of olfactory hallucinations (OHs), specifically within the schizophrenia population. This aim was addressed by employing a symptom-focused approach that combined clinical neuropsychological and cognitive neuropsychological perspectives to inform the understanding of the neural, neuropsychological and cognitive causes of OHs. Method: Two groups of clinical patients (one comprised of those self-reporting recent OHs (n = 11) and another self-reporting auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs - with no lifetime history of OHs; n = 10)), in addition to a group of healthy controls (n = 18) completed a battery of neuropsychological tasks tapping into executive and amygdala functioning. An odour source discrimination task and an auditory verbal source monitoring task was also completed. Results: Evidence of <b>smell</b> identification <b>impairment</b> and aspects of general executive dysfunction was found in both clinical groups relative to controls. However, a pattern of dysfunction that particularly implicates OFC and amygdala neural circuitry (and disruption to their associated higher level neuropsychological skills) was also found that was specific to patients experiencing OHs. On tasks of source monitoring, preliminary evidence was found on the odour source discrimination task suggestive of a sensory specific source monitoring bias for patients with schizophrenia who experience OHs. In addition, a specific source monitoring deficit for auditory-verbal information was also found in patients that experience AVHs. Conclusion: The obtained results suggest that the generation of OHs may be underpinned by a combination of specific neuronal and related source monitoring dysfunction. This finding has implications for therapy in individuals with schizophrenia who experience OHs. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 1 online resource (119 p.) col. il...|$|R
