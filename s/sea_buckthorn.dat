5|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> oil, {{derived from}} Hippophae rhamnoides, {{produced}} in northern China, used primarily medicinally.|$|E
5|$|Research {{into the}} {{possible}} commercial use of <b>Sea</b> <b>Buckthorn</b> was undertaken by Moray College commencing in 2006. The orange berries can be processed into jams, liquors and ointments and the hardy species grows well even on exposed west coasts.|$|E
25|$|In northwestern China, <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> shrubs {{have been}} {{planted on the}} bottoms of dry riverbeds to {{increase}} water retention of the soil, thus decreasing sediment loss. Because of increased moisture conservation of the soil and nitrogen-fixing capabilities of <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn,</b> vegetation levels have increased in areas where <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> have been planted. <b>Sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> was once distributed free of charge to Canadian prairie farmers by PFRA {{to be used in}} shelterbelts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> USDA {{hardiness}} {{zones are}} about 3 through 7.|$|E
25|$|Different {{parts of}} <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> {{have been used}} as {{traditional}} therapies for diseases. Bark and leaves have been used for treating diarrhea and dermatological disorders. Berry oil, either taken orally or applied topically, is believed to be a skin softener. In Indian, Chinese and Tibetan medicines, <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> fruit may be added to medications in belief it affects pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiac, blood or metabolic disorders.|$|E
25|$|Besides juice, <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> fruit {{can be used}} to make pies, jams, lotions, teas, fruit wines, and liquors. The {{juice or}} pulp has other {{potential}} applications in foods, beverages, or cosmetics products. Fruit drinks were among the earliest <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> products developed in China. Sea buckthorn-based juice is popular in Germany and Scandinavian countries. It provides a nutritious beverage, rich in vitamin C and carotenoids.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> berries are edible and nutritious, though astringent, sour and oily, {{unpleasant}} to eat raw, unless 'bletted' (frosted {{to reduce}} the astringency) and/or mixed as a drink with sweeter substances such as apple or grape juice. Additionally, malolactic fermentation of <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> juice reduces sourness, thus in general enhances sensory properties. The mechanism behind this change is transformation of malic acid into lactic acid in microbial metabolism.|$|E
25|$|For {{its troops}} confronting {{extremely}} low temperatures (see Siachen), India's Defence Research Development Organization established {{a factory in}} Leh to manufacture a multivitamin herbal beverage based on <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> juice.|$|E
25|$|The {{seed and}} pulp oils have {{nutritional}} properties that vary under different processing methods. <b>Sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> oils {{are used as}} a source for ingredients in several commercially available cosmetic products and nutritional supplements.|$|E
25|$|Impact of <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> berries on {{the risk}} of {{cardiovascular}} disease is currently under preliminary research, involving studies with fresh and dried berries, extracts and oil from whole berry, pulp, or seeds.|$|E
25|$|In ancient times, {{leaves and}} young {{branches}} from <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> were supposedly fed as a remedy to horses to support weight gain and {{appearance of the}} coat, thus leading to {{the name of the}} genus, Hippophae derived from hippo (horse), and phaos (shining).|$|E
25|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> is {{a popular}} garden and {{landscaping}} shrub with an aggressive basal shoot system used for barrier hedges and windbreaks, and to stabilize riverbanks and steep slopes. They have value in northern climates for their landscape qualities, as the colorful berry clusters are retained through winter. Branches may be used by florists for designing ornaments.|$|E
25|$|When {{the berries}} are pressed, the {{resulting}} <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> juice separates into three layers: on top is a thick, orange cream; in the middle, a layer containing sea buckthorn's characteristic high content of saturated and polyunsaturated fats; {{and the bottom}} layer is sediment and juice. Containing fat sources applicable for cosmetic purposes, the upper two layers can be processed for skin creams and liniments, whereas the bottom layer {{can be used for}} edible products such as syrup.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} whether Chinese herbs help or harm. Dietary {{supplements}} are commonly used by people with eczema. Neither evening primrose oil nor borage seed oil taken orally {{have been shown to}} be effective. Both are associated with gastrointestinal upset. Probiotics do not appear to be effective. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of zinc, selenium, vitamin D, vitamin E, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> oil, hempseed oil, sunflower oil, or fish oil as dietary supplements.|$|E
25|$|Programmes by the government, {{local and}} {{international}} organisations are working to develop and rejuvenate this traditional system of healing. Efforts are underway to preserve the intellectual property rights of amchi medicine {{for the people of}} Ladakh. The government has also been trying to promote the <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> in the form of juice and jam, as it is believed to possess many medicinal properties. This is seen as a means of providing employment to self-help groups in rural Ladakh.|$|E

Scrub invasion occurs with native species such as willows, privet (Ligustrum vulgare) and common blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), and introduced species such as <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> (Hippophae rhamnoides). The scrub and grazed vegetation supports lichens such as the sausage lichen (Usnea articulata) and scrambled-egg lichen (Fulgensia fulgens), and around 60 species {{are found in the}} compacted soils.|$|E
25|$|Sixteen {{different}} {{herbs are}} used to make Napue, including juniper, lemon peel, angelica and cardamom as well as locally foraged meadowsweet, cranberries, birch and <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn.</b> The traditional Napue gin and tonic recipe that won at the IWSC is served with a Fever-Tree Indian Tonic Water, cranberries and rosemary. The rye gin is named after the Battle of Napue fought between the Swedish Empire and the Tsardom of Russia close to the distillery's location in 1714 during the Great Northern War.|$|E
25|$|Hippophae rhamnoides, {{the common}} <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn,</b> {{is by far}} the most {{widespread}} of the species in the genus, with the ranges of its eight subspecies extending from the Atlantic coasts of Europe across to northwestern Mongolia and northwestern China. In western Europe, it is largely confined to sea coasts where salt spray off the sea prevents other larger plants from outcompeting it, but in central Asia, it is more widespread in dry semi-desert sites where other plants cannot survive the dry conditions.|$|E

2500|$|Common <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> has [...] {{dense and}} stiff branches, {{and are very}} thorny. The leaves are a {{distinct}} pale silvery-green, lanceolate, [...] long, and less than [...] broad. It is dioecious, with separate male and female plants. The male produces brownish flowers which produce wind-distributed pollen. The female plants produce orange berries [...] in diameter, soft, juicy, and rich in oils. The roots distribute rapidly and extensively, providing a nonleguminous nitrogen fixation role in surrounding soils.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> fruit {{consists}} of sugars, sugar alcohols, fruit acids, vitamins (C, E, and K), phenolic compounds, carotenoids, fiber, amino acids, minerals, and plant sterols. The fruit contains {{many of these}} in high amounts, so is considered highly nutritious. Species belonging to genus Hippophae accumulate oil both in soft parts and in seed of the fruit. Oil content in soft parts is 1.5-3.0%, while in seed this is 11% of the fresh weight. For the compositions of <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> oils, see article: <b>sea</b> <b>buckthorn</b> oil.|$|E
