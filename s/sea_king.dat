5|$|As of 2014, the WS-61 <b>Sea</b> <b>King</b> {{remains in}} {{operation}} in Britain, {{as well as}} several export customers: Germany, Norway, Egypt and India. Some operators have replaced, or are planning to replace, the <b>Sea</b> <b>King</b> with more modern helicopters, such as the NHIndustries NH90 and the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin.|$|E
5|$|In British service, the Westland <b>Sea</b> <b>King</b> {{provided}} {{a wide range}} of services in both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. As well as wartime roles in the Falklands War, the Gulf War, the Balkans conflict, the Iraq War and the Afghanistan War, the <b>Sea</b> <b>King</b> is perhaps most well known in its capacity as a Royal Navy Search and Rescue (red and grey livery) and RAF Search and Rescue Force (yellow livery) helicopter. The <b>Sea</b> <b>King</b> was also adapted to meet the Royal Navy's requirement for a ship-based airborne early warning platform.|$|E
5|$|The Westland WS-61 <b>Sea</b> <b>King</b> is a British licence-built {{version of}} the American Sikorsky S-61 {{helicopter}} of the same name, built by Westland Helicopters. The aircraft differs considerably from the American version, with Rolls-Royce Gnome engines (derived from the US General Electric T58), British-made anti-submarine warfare systems and a fully computerised flight control system. The <b>Sea</b> <b>King</b> was primarily designed for performing anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions. A <b>Sea</b> <b>King</b> variant was adapted by Westland as troop transport known as the Commando.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, {{following}} their drawdown in US service, {{there have been}} a number of initiatives to refurbish ex-military <b>Sea</b> <b>Kings</b> for continued operations; in addition to civil operators, nations such as Egypt and India acquired refurbished former US <b>Sea</b> <b>Kings</b> to supplement their own aging fleets. While Sikorsky had ended production of the type during the 1970s, it was reported that nearly 600 <b>Sea</b> <b>Kings</b> were in operational service in 2009.|$|R

5|$|In 1982, India {{signed a}} {{contract}} to purchase several Mk42B <b>Sea</b> <b>Kings,</b> an upgraded variant to perform dual-purpose: anti-shipping and anti-submarine missions, following a competition for the order against the Aérospatiale Super Puma. These helicopters would operate from the Godavari-class frigates as well as replace the existing <b>Sea</b> <b>Kings.</b> A team of Indian engineers was sent to Britain to help develop the Mk42B's avionics, especially the onboard software. Changes from the older <b>Sea</b> <b>Kings</b> included a brand new avionics suite, the use of composite materials throughout the fuselage and in the rotor blades, {{as well as the}} integration of the Sea Eagle missile, which had been procured from Britain in 1983. Between 1988 and 1992, a total of 20 Mk42B <b>Sea</b> <b>Kings</b> were delivered to the Indian Navy.|$|R

5|$|Egypt is a {{prolific}} operator of the <b>Sea</b> <b>King,</b> using many different variants {{for a wide}} variety of purposes. In addition to operating ASW Sea Kings for coastal patrols, Egypt procured a land-based transport adapted from the basic <b>Sea</b> <b>King,</b> marketed by Westland as the Commando, including a VIP subvariant. An electronic warfare version was also deployed by the Egyptian Air Force, featuring sophisticated onboard jamming systems. As of 2011, 23 Sea Kings/Commandos remain in service with Egypt.|$|E

Until 1998, some long-range missions with <b>Sea</b> <b>Kings</b> were flown with assistance of P-3 Orion aircraft to serve as radio relays, at one point allowing for a record [...] mission. The air station was in 1998 converted to a station group under Bodø Main Air Station.|$|R
