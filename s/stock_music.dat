25|$|Most of the {{innovative}} incidental music for Doctor Who has been specially commissioned from freelance composers, {{although in the}} early years some episodes also used <b>stock</b> <b>music,</b> as well as occasional excerpts from original recordings or cover versions of songs by popular music acts such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys. Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s.|$|E
500|$|To get a {{feel for}} the era, X-Files {{composer}} Mark Snow listened to the big band music of Gene Krupa, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and Harry James. The [...] "bouncy instrumental" [...] that plays during the fight scene in the ballroom was inspired by a similar swing tune composed by John Williams for the 1979 Steven Spielberg film 1941. Snow later joked that his composition was [...] "the third generation of the same inspiration." [...] Carter had significant musical input when it came to scene transitions, saying, [...] "I got a chance to use some of my favorite '40s music here, too, or '30s and '40s music to transition scenes." [...] The song that is heard near the end of the ballroom fight and in the scene featuring Scully and the Lone Gunmen searching for the Queen Anne is a piece of <b>stock</b> <b>music</b> called [...] "Hot Liquorice", composed by Dick Walters. Producer Paul Rabwin oversaw a special arrangement of the 1938 jazz standard [...] "Jeepers Creepers", which was included in the ballroom scene.|$|E
500|$|Ambient {{music for}} the first four Five Nights at Freddy's games {{consisted}} mostly of <b>stock</b> <b>music,</b> altered by Cawthon according to the game's needs. Notable music found in the games include the [...] "Toreador Song", which is played when the player runs out of power in the first game, and a music box rendition of [...] "My Grandfather's Clock", played from The Puppet's music box as it winds down in Five Nights at Freddy's 2.FNaF World and Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location instead receive their own OST, composed by Leon Riskin specifically for the games. Music created for FNaF World varied from battle themes to general ambience for various locations, for example [...] "Dungeon Theme", for when the player is in the Mysterious Mine, and [...] "Water Theme", for when they are in Lilygear Lake. Music in Sister Location had a variety of uses: music such as [...] "Turtle Crusher" [...] and [...] "MVP" [...] are used for minigames, while ambiance such as [...] "Crumbling Dreams" [...] play during the main game. A musical piece titled [...] "Dramatic Soap Opera" [...] was created specifically for the between-night soap opera, The Immortal and The Restless. Additional numbers were added in the Custom Night DLC, notably [...] "Watch Your 6", the main ambiance for Custom Night (although this music was also used for the main game's alternate ending), and [...] "Demolition Inevitable", music played in the final cutscene of the game.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{took place}} between 26 August 1978 and 23 December 1978 at {{locations}} around Middlesex and Hertfordshire as well as London, including Wembley Stadium. The budget was £1.25 million, {{making it one of}} the most expensive undertakings Euston had attempted at that time. Production designer Arnold Chapkis constructed several large and elaborate sets, including those for the megalithic standing stones at Ringstone Round, the Kapps' radio telescope and observatory, and the decaying urban landscape of London; Kneale quipped about the radio telescope set that [...] "it probably would have worked if they'd just aimed it properly!". Associate producer Norton Knatchbull noted that the serial [...] "was the first 'art department' picture Euston has ever been involved in, in the sense that major sets had to be built on location". This led Euston executive Johnny Goodman to joke, [...] "Our biggest problem was finding someone who wanted the two giant telescope dishes after we finished filming. There's not much demand for such things". One aspect where the budget was less than generous was with the model sequences made by Clearwater Films; Johnny Goodman remarked that the cost was less than James Bond producer Cubby Broccoli [...] "would spend on cigars in a week". Post-production was completed in mid-February 1979. Unlike the original BBC Quatermass serials, which had used <b>stock</b> <b>music</b> tracks, the new serial had a specially composed soundtrack by Marc Wilkinson and Nic Rowley which made particular use of the nursery rhyme [...] "Huffity, Puffity, Ringstone Round" [...] devised by Kneale in his scripts.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Stock</b> <b>music</b> {{and sound}} effects from {{this story was}} {{released}} on a [...] "mini-album" [...] by Via Satellite in 1997. It is composed of 2 versions of the Doctor Who theme music, sound effects from [...] and an incomplete selection of <b>stock</b> <b>music</b> used in the story. It was planned {{to be the first}} in a series of mini-albums, with The Faceless Ones and Inside the Spaceship being mooted as future albums. Neither was produced.|$|E
2500|$|The {{score for}} the series was taken from <b>stock</b> <b>music</b> libraries, often adaptations of music from B-movies. For example, one cue used in the episode [...] "Peril by Sea" [...] also appears in Plan 9 from Outer Space. Apparently the only {{original}} music written for the series was the March heard primarily during the credits. The theme is ascribed to studio music arranger Leon Klatzkin, although {{it may have been}} adapted from an earlier unrelated (and now lost) theme. The main theme, based on a triad, matched the three syllables in the character's name, as has been the case with nearly all Superman music. With the exception of the title theme, musical cues ranged from the serious to the light-hearted and were different for each of the seasons, except for the third season, where some cues from the previous season would be reused in a number of episodes. Each season's cues tended to be used repeatedly from episode to episode, in similarly appropriate [...] "mood" [...] moments such as apprehension, humor or fast action. The opening credits theme, Superman's [...] "leitmotif", was often (though not always) used whenever Superman was depicted flying or taking action.|$|E
