50|$|This {{initial program}} in 1945 was {{followed}} by a phase of malaria eradication, through a national campaign by application of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>insecticide</b> dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane better known as (DDT). The controversial use of DDT in Venezuela was carried out in a controlled manner through the work of the Italian-Venezuelan chemical Ettore Mazzarri, founder of the Chemical Laboratory of Malaria in 1948. The results were immediate: by 1950 the death rate from malaria in the country had been reduced to 9 per 100,000 inhabitants and was eradicated in an area of 132 000 km2. In 1955, 10 years after the program started the rate was lowered to 1 per 100 000 population and the eradicated area had increased to 305,414 km2. Moron, an area that had the highest rates of mortality from malaria, had spent three years with no deaths by malaria. Thereafter the great population explosion in Venezuela occurred with evident achievements and successes which were recognized nationally and internationally.|$|E

50|$|Sodium monofluorophosphate {{was first}} {{described}} in 1929 by the German chemist Willy Lange, {{who was then}} with the University of Berlin. His fruitless attempts to prepare the free monofluorophosphoric acid led him to check the stability of its esters. Together with Gerda von Krüger, one of his students, Lange thus synthesized diethyl fluorophosphate and some analogs, which proved to be quite toxic, being related to nerve agents. In the 1930s, Gerhard Schrader, working for the German company IG Farben, tried to develop <b>synthetic</b> <b>insecticide.</b> His work focused on esters of phosphoric acid and resulted in an accidental discovery of some other nerve agents such as DFP (diisopropyl fluorophosphate), Tabun, Soman, and Sarin. In the meantime, Lange, who {{was married to a}} Jewish woman, emigrated from Germany to the United States and started work for Procter and Gamble Company. In 1947, he and Ralph Livingston of Monsanto Company published the preparation of the free fluorophosphoric acids and mentioned the use of some toxic esters of monofluorophosphoric acid (like DFP) in the treatment of glaucoma and myasthenia gravis. The well known toxicity of these esters led to fears that the simple salts might also be toxic, and such fears precluded any large scale commercial use of the salts. In 1950, under sponsorship of the manufacturer of the compounds, Ozark Chemical Company, the toxicity of sodium monofluorophosphate was studied by Harold Hodge at the University of Rochester who included anti-cavity testing. In 1967 Colgate-Palmolive filed several patents on the use of sodium monofluorophosphate in toothpaste.|$|E

Results showed observed commonest insects to include Green leaf hopper (Empoasca spp.), Fruit borers (Leucinodes orbanalis), variegated grasshopper (Zonocerus variegatus) and Cutworms (Spodoptera littoralis). All the bio-pesticidal treatments significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced insect infestation with low damage and higher fruit yield compared with the control. The African black pepper (Piper guineense) displayed highest degree of efficacy in this regard of all the plant extracts in both seasons (2011 and 2012).
