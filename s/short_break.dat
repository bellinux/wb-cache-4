5|$|In January 2010, {{the band}} {{announced}} that they would take a <b>short</b> <b>break</b> after being {{on the road for}} the better part of six years. The break lasted for about a year-and-a-half, during which band members devoted themselves on solo projects, while the band made sporadic other contributions.|$|E
5|$|In {{between his}} various duties and responsibilities, Nansen had {{continued}} to take skiing holidays when he could. In February 1930, aged 68, he took a <b>short</b> <b>break</b> in the mountains with two old friends, who noted that Nansen was slower than usual and appeared to tire easily. On his return to Oslo he was laid up for several months, with influenza and later phlebitis, and was visited on his sickbed by King Haakon VII.|$|E
5|$|Binaural is {{the sixth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Pearl Jam, released on May 16, 2000 through Epic Records. Following a full-scale tour {{in support of}} its previous album, Yield (1998), Pearl Jam took a <b>short</b> <b>break</b> before reconvening {{toward the end of}} 1999 to begin work on a new album. During the production of the album, the band encountered hindrances such as singer Eddie Vedder's writer's block, and guitarist Mike McCready's entrance into rehabilitation due to an addiction to prescription drugs.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{reports on}} a cross-sectional sample of families with a disabled child using <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> in England; it describes the characteristics {{of children and families}} using <b>short</b> <b>breaks,</b> the nature and quantity of the <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> they are using, their experiences of and satisfaction with <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> and which factors are associated with a range of outcomes for family carers, disabled children and their siblings. This report uses both quantitative data derived from standardised questions and qualitative data from family members’ written responses to open-ended questions in the survey instruments...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{discussed in}} this report builds upon and extends {{the findings from the}} preliminary report. Six main themes were identified from the data and are presented in separate sections. The first focuses upon the ways in which disabled children and their families use <b>short</b> <b>breaks,</b> identifying the range of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> we encountered during the research. The next theme looks at the physical location of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> and how access issues and the suitability of the location and venue can affect their beneficial impact. The ways in which information and communication affect access to and experience of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> is considered in the third theme. What families and disabled children want from the people who provide the <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> forms the focus of the fourth theme. The relationship between family members and <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> carers is considered in the fifth theme and the final theme examines issues around sustainability and support for disabled children and their families to lead normal lives...|$|R
40|$|There are {{widespread}} {{assumptions about}} the potential impacts of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> on family carers and disabled children. This review aims to evaluate the existing international research evidence concerning the impacts of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> on families with a disabled child. Electronic literature searches were conducted using ASSIA, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Web of Science, and requests for information were sent to selected email lists. Of 60 articles or reports identified {{for inclusion in the}} review, the vast majority of studies were cross-sectional, with only eight studies using quasi-experimental pre-post designs or longitudinal designs. Nonetheless, the consistency with which some findings have been reported suggests that <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> appear to have the potential to positively impact on not only the well-being of carers, but also the children receiving <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> and their families as a whole. Additional research is warranted in a number of areas. First, research needs to consider the impact of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> on fathers. Second, {{there is a need to}} consider in more depth how <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> can impact on the siblings of disabled children. Third, research could consider how best <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> can be combined with other interventions to maximise the impact for disabled children and their families. Fourth, research needs to look at the longer term impact of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> on outcomes for disabled children and their families. What is needed is evidence on what type of <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> are best for children and families with particular characteristics at particular times during the course of the child's maturation towards adulthood...|$|R
5|$|Dream Theater {{began their}} tour {{in support of}} A Dramatic Turn of Events on July 4, 2011 in Rome, Italy. The second leg of the tour took place in North America, where the band headlined with Trivium. After a <b>short</b> <b>break</b> to {{conclude}} 2011, the band returned to Europe with Periphery, then to North America with Crimson Projekct before heading to South America for the final leg of the tour. On August 19 and 20, they filmed two shows at Luna Park in Buenos Aires, Argentina for a live Blu-ray release.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the federation, Welensky moved to Salisbury, Rhodesia (renamed from Southern Rhodesia after Northern Rhodesia gained independence as Zambia). After a <b>short</b> <b>break,</b> he was invited to lead the UFP in Rhodesia, which had recently renamed itself the Rhodesia Party. With the Rhodesian Front pushing for independence for the territory and a new constitution, the Rhodesia Party advocated the same, but with a focus on stemming white emigration and rebuilding the economy (all three territories had slipped into recession {{with the end of the}} federation).|$|E
5|$|After a <b>short</b> <b>break,</b> the {{division}} was allocated to a {{sector of the}} Margarethe Line, a series of fixed defensive works south of Lake Balaton which held up the Soviet advance. After several Red Army assaults were repulsed, static trench warfare developed between December 1944 and January 1945. In early March 1945, a few units took part in Operation Frühlingserwachen (Spring Awakening), {{which was to be}} Germany's last major offensive. Meanwhile, from December 1944 to March 1945, the rest of {{the division}} remained at Barcs rebuilding. In February, they had been joined by the divisional pioneer battalion, which had finally managed to withdraw from Bosnia. On 16 March, the Soviets launched the Vienna Offensive, bypassing the Barcs area. That night, the division attacked the flanks of the Soviet drive at Heresznye, where it undertook its last offensive operation of the war.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} investigates the {{benefits}} of a good night’s sleep and <b>short</b> work <b>breaks</b> for employees’ daily work engagement. It is hypothesized that sleep and self-initiated <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> help restore energetic and self-regulatory resources which, in turn, enable employees to experience high work engagement. A daily diary study was conducted with 107 employees who provided data twice a day (before lunch {{and at the end of}} the working day) over 5 workdays (453 days in total). Multilevel regression analyses showed that sleep quality and <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> were beneficial for employees’ daily work engagement. After nights employees slept better, they indicated higher work engagement during the day. Moreover, taking self-initiated <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> from work in the afternoon boosted daily work engagement, whereas taking <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> in the morning failed to predict daily work engagement. Taking <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> did not compensate for impaired sleep with regard to daily work engagement. Overall, these findings suggest that recovery before and during work can foster employees’ daily work engagement. Article free to read on journal websit...|$|R

5|$|Anthrax was {{announced}} as the headliner {{for the third}} annual Metal Alliance US tour, which endured through March and April 2013. Supporting acts included Exodus, Municipal Waste, and Holy Grail, with the headliner Anthrax performing Among the Living in its entirety. Charlie Benante has been taking time off from gigs outside the US because of personal reasons. His place was filled in by drummer Jon Dette during these shows. The group filmed their performance at Santiago, Chile, with Benante on drums, for the DVD album Chile On Hell. The tour ended with a show at San Bernardino, California, at the two-year anniversary of the album's release. After finishing the tour, the band took a <b>short</b> <b>break</b> before reconvening to start work on a new album.|$|E
5|$|Kiedis {{knew that}} the band's sound would inevitably change when Navarro joined. In June 1994, the band entered The Sound Factory, a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles, to record the album. The band completed a few basic tracks, when Kiedis began having difficulty singing. He had been through a dental procedure in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs. Kiedis had slipped from five years of sobriety and began reusing narcotics he'd sworn never to use again. The band took a <b>short</b> <b>break</b> from recording to perform at Woodstock '94, {{which was the first}} show Navarro played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E
5|$|The Legion took a <b>short</b> <b>break</b> {{from active}} duty to receive new aircraft, {{including}} Bf 109Es, He 111Es and Js, and Hs 126As, bringing its strength to 96 aircraft, around {{a fifth of}} the Nationalist's force as a whole. Von Richthofen returned to Spain in overall command, with Hans Seidemann as chief of staff. This reinforcement may have been the single most important intervention by a foreign side in the war, enabling a counterattack after the Battle of the Ebro. It mainly took part in operations against the remaining Republican air force during January–February 1939, with considerable success. It was rapidly dissolved. The men returned on 26 May; the best aircraft were returned to Germany {{and the rest of the}} equipment bought by the new Spanish regime.|$|E

5|$|The trails {{through the}} park, {{including}} one for mountain biking, run almost parallel along the ridge. There is a natural pond with fishes and turtles in the north-west of the park. A 280-metre long canopy walk was completed {{in the eastern part}} of the park in October 2003, linking Kent Ridge Park to the war museum, Reflections at Bukit Chandu, enhancing the park's and museum's accessibility to the public. Along the walk, there are information boards providing educational information on the flora and fauna in the park. At the half-way point, there is a shelter for visitors to take a <b>short</b> <b>break</b> or to enjoy a scenic view of Normanton Park and the National Parks Board's plant nursery.|$|E
5|$|The {{witnesses}} took {{ten hours}} to testify, {{during which time}} the court sat continuously. After a <b>short</b> <b>break,</b> the judge began his summing up, taking two hours to charge the jury. The judge urged the jury to put their prejudice at hearing that Thornton had sex with Ashford out of their heads; they were here to determine if Thornton was guilty of the offence charged. He pointed out to the jury the lack of concealment exhibited by Thornton, his admission of the sexual act and of being with Ashford until 4a.m. The judge told them {{it was not possible}} for Thornton to have committed the acts alleged by the prosecution and still have made it to the Holden farm {{by the time he was}} seen by Heydon, and stressed that Thornton did not act like a man who ran. The judge concluded by reminding the jury that it was better a murderer go free than an innocent man be convicted.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Simpson trained {{throughout}} his winter break into 1957. In May, he rode {{in the national}} 25-mile championships; although he was the favourite, he lost to Sheil in the final. In a points race at an international event at Fallowfield a week later Simpson crashed badly, almost breaking his leg; he stopped working {{for a month and}} struggled to regain his form. At the national pursuit championships, he was beaten in the quarter-finals. After this defeat Simpson returned to road racing, winning the BLRC national hill climb championship in October before taking a <b>short</b> <b>break</b> from racing. In spring 1958 he traveled to Sofia with Sheil for two weeks' racing. On his return he won the national individual pursuit championship at Herne Hill Velodrome. In July, Simpson won a silver medal for England in the individual pursuit at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, losing to Sheil by one-hundredth of a second in the final. A medical exam taken with the Royal Air Force (RAF) revealed Simpson to be colour blind.|$|E

40|$|For over 30 years, <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> {{have been}} part of the {{landscape}} of support provision for families with a disabled child. Historically, the term ‘respite care’ has been used in much of the research literature concerning <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> for families with a disabled child. However, ‘short breaks’ has become the preferred term, partly due to the negative connotations of family carers requiring ‘respite’ from their children, and partly because <b>short</b> <b>breaks</b> now encompass a much wider range of supports than out-of-home placement in specialist residential facilities (Cramer and Carlin, 2008). As such, the term ‘short breaks’ will be used throughout this review, with the exception of direct quotes from research studies where the term ‘respite’ is used by study participants or study authors...|$|R

5|$|Football {{games last}} {{for a total of}} 60 minutes in {{professional}} and college play and are divided into two-halves of 30 minutes and four-quarters of 15 minutes. High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two-halves of 24 minutes and four-quarters of 12 minutes. The two-halves are separated by a halftime period, and the first and third quarters are also followed by a <b>short</b> <b>break.</b> Prior {{to the start of the}} game, the referee and team captains for each team meet at midfield for a coin toss. The visiting team is allowed to call 'heads' or 'tails'; the winner of the toss is allowed to decide between choosing whether to receive or kick off the ball or choosing which goal they want to defend, but they can also defer their choice until the second half. The losing team, unless the winning team decides to defer, is allowed to choose the option the winning team did not select, and receives the option to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game would allow the other team to choose which goal to defend. Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters. If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.|$|E
