40|$|In the <b>spline</b> <b>rolling</b> {{process with}} round dies, {{additional}} kinematic compensation {{is an essential}} mechanism for improving the division of teeth and pitch accuracy as well as surface quality. The motion characteristic between the die and workpiece under varied center distance in the <b>spline</b> <b>rolling</b> process was investigated. Mathematical models of the instantaneous center of rotation, transmission ratio, and centrodes in the rolling process were established. The models were {{used to analyze the}} rolling process of the involute spline with circular dedendum, and the results indicated that (1) with the reduction in the center distance, the instantaneous center moves toward workpiece, and the transmission ratio increases at first and then decreases; (2) the variations in the instantaneous center and transmission ratio are discontinuous, presenting an interruption when the involute flank begins to be formed; (3) the change in transmission ratio at the forming stage of the workpiece with the involute flank can be negligible; and (4) the centrode of the workpiece is an Archimedes line whose polar radius reduces, and the centrode of the rolling die is similar to Archimedes line when the workpiece is with the involute flank...|$|E

Spline shaft {{is widely}} used {{as one of the}} {{important}} parts in machinery, It is complex in manufacturing process, its appearance quality and size precision and the comprehensive mechanical performance requirements of high. Small modulus involute <b>spline</b> <b>rolling</b> technology has many advantages, Can reduce the cost, improve quality and The use of reliable. Cold rolling process is currently the main processing mode for small module splines, but the special machine is too expensive. This article describes how to achieve a small modulus spline cold rubbing process by transforming an existing thread rolling machine while without buying the expensive special machine. The focus is on the problems encountered in the process of equipment transformation: design of cutters, control of the workpiece diameter and how to solve the fault spline gear in the course of processing...|$|E
40|$|In <b>spline</b> <b>rolling</b> process, the billet {{is mainly}} driven by {{frictional}} moment at initial forming stage that from starting rolling to billet/workpiece rotated half circle. If {{the rotation of}} billet is not normally driven by rolling die, then the motion between billet and rolling die is not coordinated, and then dividing precision of external spline will be reduced. Thus, the rotatory condition of rolled billet was established in this work. The rotatory condition for the rolling process of spline with even number of teeth {{is different from that}} with an odd number of teeth. However, the changing trends for both rotatory conditions are the same. The results indicated that (i) the rotatory condition can be improved when the friction between die and billet increases or the outside diameter of rolling die increases, (ii) the rotatory condition for odd number of teeth is better than that for even number of teeth, and (iii) the outside diameter of rolling die should be five times greater than the diameter of billet before rolling according to the rotatory condition. The reasonable decrement can be selected by comprehensive considering of rotatory condition and geometry of rolling die...|$|E

30|$|An on-machine {{non-contact}} {{measurement method}} for <b>spline</b> shaft <b>rolling</b> performance evaluation is proposed. To verify {{the validity of}} this method, a measurement prototype mainly consisted of a laser displacement sensor and rotary encoder was built on a rolling machine.

40|$|Residual {{stress is}} an {{important}} parameter {{in the evaluation of}} the performance of a cold <b>rolling</b> <b>spline</b> surface. However, research on cold <b>rolling</b> <b>spline</b> is rare. To improve the surface property of a spline, an involute spline is selected as the object of this study. The contour method for determining cold roll-beating residual stress involves measuring the force spatial distribution, performing a statistical analysis of the experimental results, establishing the parameters for the tooth profile for different positions (dedendum, pitch, and addendum) of residual stress, and determining the effect of pressure on the relationship between stress and the depth of the cold roll-beating. A response surface method is used to establish the spline tooth profile of the dedendum, pitch, and addendum of the residual stress and different depths of the stress layer to obtain the parameters of a multiple regression model and perform a comparative analysis of the experimental and prediction results. Research indicates that the prediction results have high reliability. The establishment of this model has important guiding significance to control the residual stress in the cold roll-beating forming process, optimize the cold roll-beating processing parameters, and improve the surface properties of cold <b>rolling</b> <b>spline...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{dimensional}} {{change of the}} tooth roots {{can be achieved by}} calculating the radius of tooth root circle before and after rolling. The relationship between the {{dimensional change}} and the residual stress should be established by rolling experiments in the future. Accordingly, the <b>spline</b> shaft <b>rolling</b> performance can be rapidly evaluated using the dimensional change as an alternative evaluation parameter. It is also worth noting that a hydraulic servo system should be used to generate accurate pressures in the future experiments and the residual stress will be measured using the X-ray diffraction (XRD).|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} control the quality of <b>spline</b> shaft in <b>rolling</b> process, an {{efficient}} measurement method for rolling performance evaluation is essential. Here, a newly developed on-machine non-contact measurement prototype based on laser displacement sensor and rotary encoder is proposed. The prototype is intended for the automated evaluation of the <b>spline</b> shaft <b>rolling</b> performance by measuring the dimensional change of tooth root, which is correlated with the surface residual stress and micro-hardness. Laser displacement sensor and rotary encoder are used to record the polar radius and polar angle of each point on measuring section. Data are displayed in a polar coordinate system and fitted in a gear. Through multipoint curvature method, the roots of spline shaft are recognized automatically. Then, the dimensional change can be calculated by fitting the radius of the tooth root circle before and after rolling. Systematic error covering offset error is also analyzed and calibrated. At last, measurement test {{results show that the}} system has advantages of simple structure, high measurement precision (radius error <[*] 0.6  μm), high measurement efficiency (measuring time <[*] 2  s) and automatic control ability, providing a new opportunity for the efficient evaluation of various spline shafts in high-precision mechanical processing.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is about a}} costly problem in the automotive industry due to tool fracture during the <b>splines</b> cold <b>rolling</b> of steel shafts. The objective is to study {{the cause of this}} failure and propose solutions that can be implemented in the workshop. The writing starts with a brief introduction of the companies involved in shafts production and problem solving. It introduces the cold rolling process and its advantages on splines manufacturing, and it goes through relevant material and process characteristics that help to determine the cause of tool fracture. In order to understand the process failure and production flow, it has been necessary to build up an Ishikawa diagram with possible tool fracture causes. After collecting and analysing the data about the machine tool, cold rolling process and work-piece and rolling tool materials, tests and experiments have been done. It has been considered that there is a rolling tool fatigue that causes tool fracture. Beside tool fracture, two more problems with production flow instability and the right side rolling tool have been detected. Testing the material hardness of the work-piece has shown continuous hardness fluctuations from the supplier. Rolling tool misalignment has been measured by using a vernier caliper measurement device. Rolling tools material hardness analysis shows that tool is very hard and it is possible to use a tougher material which responds better to cyclic loads. Leax has tried to solve the problem by testing another lubrication and tool coatings. A modal analysis test has been performed in order to find the natural frequency of the work-piece which possibly may lead to vibration and over loading one of the rolling tools. The conclusion that has been reached is that main cause of fracture is rolling tool fatigue due to cyclic loads and it is important to use other rolling tool material. The other two detected problems, production flow instability and rigth side rolling tool fracture, should be considered {{as a part of the}} problem in order to significantly increase tools life and stabilize production flow rate...|$|R
