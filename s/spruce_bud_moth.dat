50|$|The <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> <b>moths</b> of {{the genus}} Zeiraphera, transcontinental in range, are found {{frequently}} on white spruce but only occasionally on other spruces and firs (Rose and Lindquist 1985). Zeiraphera canadensis (Mutuura and Freeman Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), has caused {{a high incidence of}} multiple and abnormal leaders in white spruce in the Maritime provinces, Quebec, and Maine (Quiring et al. 1991). However, although severe feeding damage has seldom been extensive in forests, new shoots on open-grown white spruce are frequently disfigured (Rose and Lindquist 1985). The insect overwinters in the egg stage on the tree. The larva emerges in May and feeds underneath the bud cap, which it characteristically secures to the growing shoot with silk. The cap remains in place long after the other bud caps have been shed, an obvious impediment to the effectiveness of contact insecticides. When populations are high, it is not unusual to find several larvae feeding among the needles of a single shoot. The head and thoracic legs of young larvae are dark brown, but full-grown larvae are cream to yellow and about 10 mm long. Feeding is completed in June or early July, whereupon the larva drops to the ground and becomes a pupa in the litter. From mid-July to mid-August, moths emerge from the pupae to lay eggs singly or in groups of two to seven at the base of shoots of the current year. In a New Brunswick seed orchard, white spruce of intermediate height (1.5 to 3.73 m) were damaged most, and damage in one year was positively correlated with damage in the next. At four test sites, mean growth reduction of trees in the two most susceptible families was estimated to be approximately 30% higher than those of trees in the two least susceptible families. The lack of damage to some trees, among those trees suffering damage, suggested the existence of genetically based differences in susceptibility to this pest.|$|R

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{patterns}} of insect population densities, for instance, spatial synchrony in population cycles, {{have been observed}} at different scales for several species and appear {{to be related to}} distinct phenomena of spatial and/or biological nature.

We explored the effect of orography at a finer resolution on modelled potential dispersal ranges of larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth</b> by incorporating a high resolution GIS based migration model with a coarse resolution population dynamics simulation model.

40|$|<b>Spruce</b> <b>bud</b> scale (Physokermes piceae Schrnk.) affects {{tree growth}} {{directly}} and indirectly. Direct injury {{appears in the}} form of tissue damage, as insects suck sap from tree phloem. Indirect injury appears as “honeydew”, which results in negative effects on tree growth. Plant sap is saturated with various carbohydrates called photosynthates that are difficult for scaly insects to digest. Therefore it is secreted in excrements, which are subsequently a food source for the black sooty mold (Apiosporium pinophilum Fuckel). The fungus covers needles blocking stomata, causing decreased transpiration and photosynthesis. An inexplicable wither of Norway spruce was reported in Latvia during 2010 due to black sooty mold. However, <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> scale was not evident. In 2011, mass propagation of <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> scale was observed following the 2010 Norway spruce loss. One objective of this research was to determine if Kraft tree growth classes could be applied to establish the factors responsible for tree foliage damage. Six 21 - 40 year old (second age class) Norway spruce stands were evaluated. Two circular sample plots with a 7. 98 m radius, and a 200 -m 2 area were randomly established per each forest stand hectare. Diameter at breast height (dbh, 1. 3 m), and height of approximately 30 trees was measured to model a trend. For all trees, Kraft class, and foliage damage level caused by <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> scale and black sooty mold were determined. Significant differences were not observed in tree damage levels among stands, however significant differences among damage levels in different Kraft classes were detected (F = 3. 45 > Fcrit. = 2. 80, α = 0. 05 > P = 0. 02) found. Overall damage intensity was 29. 3 %. Total forestry loss was 1153 LVL (1640 EUR) for all surveyed stands (10 ha), and 115 LVL (164 EUR) per hectare...|$|R

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{patterns}} of cyclic larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth</b> population densities, for instance synchrony (valley scale) and travelling waves (Alpine arc scale), {{have been observed}} at different scales and maybe related to distinct causes. In this study, quantification of population data through cross-correlation analysis and spectral analysis revealed that larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth</b> population cycles at the valley scale could {{be considered to be}} in close synchrony with one another. At the Alpine arc scale the presence of travelling waves could generally be confirmed. These results have implications for the understanding of the causal mechanisms behind the observed spatio-temporal patterns, suggesting that at the valley scale synchrony depends not only on distances between subpopulations, but is also affected by environmental/habitat characteristics that vary in space. At the Alpine scale, distance between populations is of greater importance in shaping spatio-temporal patterns than at the valley scale...|$|R
