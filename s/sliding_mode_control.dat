In control theory it is sometimes possible to linearize such classes of systems and apply linear techniques, {{but in many cases}} it can be necessary to devise from scratch theories permitting control of nonlinear systems. These, e.g., feedback linearization, backstepping, <b>sliding</b> <b>mode</b> <b>control,</b> trajectory linearization control normally take advantage of results based on Lyapunov's theory. Differential geometry has been widely used as a tool for generalizing well-known linear control concepts to the non-linear case, as well as showing the subtleties that make it a more challenging problem.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} a cascade robust {{tracking}} control for a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot (WMR) is addressed, which is composed by an inverse dynamic {{control in the}} internal loop; and a robust kinematic <b>control</b> based in <b>sliding</b> <b>modes</b> <b>control</b> (SMC) techniques in the external loop. Even that invariance principle is inherent characteristic of the SMC, which assures robustness, the implementation of some SMC can be deteriorated by the so called chattering phenomenon, caused by presence of unmodeled dynamics, which e ects can be worst if there is control saturation.

5000|$|Intuitively, <b>sliding</b> <b>mode</b> <b>control</b> uses {{practically}} infinite gain {{to force}} the trajectories of a dynamic system to slide along the restricted sliding mode subspace. Trajectories from this reduced-order sliding mode have desirable properties (e.g., the system naturally slides along it until it comes to rest at a desired equilibrium). The main strength of <b>sliding</b> <b>mode</b> <b>control</b> is its robustness. Because the control {{can be as simple}} as a switching between two states (e.g., [...] "on"/"off" [...] or [...] "forward"/"reverse"), it need not be precise and will not be sensitive to parameter variations that enter into the control channel. Additionally, because the control law is not a continuous function, the sliding mode can be reached in finite time (i.e., better than asymptotic behavior). Under certain common conditions, optimality requires the use of bang-bang control; hence, <b>sliding</b> <b>mode</b> <b>control</b> describes the optimal controller for a broad set of dynamic systems.|$|E

DC-DC converters are applied in parallel to realize the transform of energy from the distributed generations (DGs) to the DC-bus.
