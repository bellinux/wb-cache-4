25|$|Thorfinn, {{having no}} other choice, follows Eskil and Vrage to meet Vagn. Surprisingly, when Vagn sees Thors’s son Thorfinn, he started crying publicly. Thorfinn finally learns {{that the person}} who ordered for Thors’s death was Floki, as Thors was the mostly likely {{candidate}} to be the third chieftain. Rage crossed Thorfinn’s mind but leaves to sort himself out. Alone, he questions if he can still change for the better and become a kinder person. Thorfinn also meets one of his old crewmates, Atli who is arrested for thievery. Atli <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> family back home and “will find an honest line of work”. Vagn warns Thorfinn that people like Atli will return to stealing and killing people instead of field labor, so killing him is better than releasing him. Hild leaves after questioning Vagn on the same thing since he is also enjoying an extravagant meal when there are no animals or fields around. Thorfinn wishes to not go to Jomsborg nor fight anyone, not even to meet Floki again. Thorfinn states that King Canute will oversee the affairs of Thors’s murder while Thorfinn will complete his own mission without needless bloodshed. Later, Vagn is puzzled when Thorfinn and Hild are trying to stop Vagn’s men from sexually assaulting the slave girls.|$|E

500|$|At this moment, cries {{are heard}} from the Knights (""): a flying swan has been shot, and a young man is brought forth, a bow {{in his hand and}} a quiver of {{matching}} arrows. Gurnemanz speaks sternly to the lad, saying this is a holy place. He asks him outright if he shot the swan, and the lad boasts that if it flies, he can hit it ("") Gurnemanz tells him that the swan is a holy animal, and asks what harm the swan had done him, and shows the youth its lifeless body. Now remorseful, the young man breaks his bow and casts it aside. Gurnemanz asks him why he is here, who his father is, how he found this place and, lastly, his name. To each question the lad replies, [...] "I don't know." [...] The elder Knight sends his squires away to help the King and now asks the boy to tell what he does know. The young man <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> mother, Herzeleide (Heart's Sorrow) and that he made the bow himself. Kundry has been listening and now tells them that this boy's father was Gamuret, a knight killed in battle, and also how the lad's mother had forbidden her son to use a sword, fearing that he would meet the same fate as his father. The youth now recalls that upon seeing knights pass through his forest, he had left his home and mother to follow them. Kundry laughs and tells the young man that, as she rode by, she saw Herzeleide die of grief. Hearing this, the lad first lunges at Kundry but then collapses in grief. Kundry herself is now weary for sleep, but cries out that she must not sleep and wishes that she might never again waken. She disappears into the undergrowth.|$|E

The guy is a fucking idiot, making threats to me, Clooney, Eli Roth, <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> doctorate—but uses the word [...] "retard" [...] in his vocabulary, come on.

I guess his low rent offices, with 15 year old 3/4 machines, archaic computers, this is just some dumb chump trying to get some fame when he has none, so he has to make YouTube lame quality anger rants. This guy just wants attention because he can't get any for the so called movies he makes. Nothing sadder when he had his screening in LA to an over half empty movie house.|$|E
