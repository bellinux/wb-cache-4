This thesis uses cost estimation techniques and computer models to analyze complex {{issues associated with}} upgrading the Navy's helicopter trainer, the TH- 57, which is approaching its <b>service</b> <b>life</b> <b>limit.</b> A decision regarding a TH- 57 upgrade is needed to support the current training syllabus. The analysis revealed that without a comprehensive long range plan, the Training Command will ultimately face a no-win situation; that is, reducing either its pilot training rate or syllabus flight hours. A pilot training rate reduction will create a shortfall of fleet pilots and a flight hour reduction may adversely impact flight training quality. The problems identified in the Chief of Naval Air Training's Tentative Operational Requirement were addressed. Several aircraft configurations were evaluated and four recommendations were made to ensure an effective upgrade. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E

Loading scheme includes three dynamical channels for the imitation flight condition of the tail propeller (X,Y,Z direction) and also three static channels for the cargo cabin and main rotor loadings. For the operate system is used Russian special test equipment "TRIAL". In order to record the history of loadings is used data acquisition system MGCplus by HBM Company (Germany). The main charasteristic of those tests is the possibility to execute by each dynamical actuator the static and dynamic loads simultaneously with different frequencies.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the activities developed by the Structural Integrity Group at the Institute of Aeronautics and Space - IAE, Brazil, as well as the status of ongoing work related to the life extension program for aircraft operated by the Brazilian Air Force BAF. The first BAF-operated airplane to undergo a DTA-based life extension was the F- 5 fighter, in the mid 1990 s. From 1998 to 2001, BAF worked on a life extension project for the BAF AT- 26 Xavante trainer. All analysis and tests were performed at IAE. The fatigue critical locations (FCLs) were presumed based upon structural design and maintenance data and also from exchange of technical information with other users of the airplane around the world. Following that work, BAF started in 2002 the extension of the operational life of the BAF T- 25 “Universal”. The T- 25 is the basic training airplane used by AFA - The Brazilian Air Force Academy. This airplane was also designed under the “safe-life” concept. As the T- 25 fleet approached its <b>service</b> <b>life</b> <b>limit,</b> the Brazilian Air Force was questioning whether it could be kept in flight safely. The answer came through an extensive Damage Tolerance Analysis (DTA) program, briefly described in this paper. The current work on aircraft structural integrity is being performed for the BAF F- 5 E/F that underwent an avionics and weapons system upgrade. Along with the increase in weight, new configurations and mission profiles were established. Again, a DTA program was proposed to be carried out in order to establish the reliability of the upgraded F- 5 fleet. As a result of all the work described, the BAF has not reported any accident due to structural failure on aircraft submitted to Damage Tolerance Analysis...|$|E

40|$|The {{reliability}} of <b>service</b> <b>life</b> prediction of building components strongly affects {{the effectiveness of}} maintenance policy setting. Despite continuous research and development efforts, existing methods still suffer lack of robustness. Typical failure mechanisms in exterior cladding systems, deterioration patterns, and <b>service</b> <b>life</b> <b>limiting</b> coefficients (modifying factors) are identified {{for a range of}} failure mechanisms. The method is based on monitoring the physical and visual performance of building components under similar service conditions, at different periods in the building <b>service</b> <b>life.</b> Three types of exterior cladding are studied: cementitious mortar, synthetic rendering, and ceramic mosaic. Failure mechanisms identified include: lack of design details (such as drip-edge and expansion joints), faulty design under marine environment, exposure to air pollution, and poor workmanship. Three typical deterioration patterns under failure conditions were determined statistically, namely, linear, exponential and logarithmic. The proposed method addresses two issues raised in ISO- 15686 in order to improve the precision and {{reliability of}} <b>service</b> <b>life</b> forecasting: (a) modifying factors for quantifying the effect of failure mechanisms are estimated within 80 % confidence limits and (b) the prediction models yield high degrees of fit to the data (coefficient of determination values ranging between R 2 �=� 0. 88 and R 2 �=� 0. 96 at a 0. 0001 level of significance). <b>Service</b> <b>life</b> prediction, performance, premature deterioration, exterior cladding, durability,...|$|R
50|$|Backplanes are {{normally}} used in preference to cables {{because of their}} greater reliability. In a cabled system, the cables need to be flexed every time that a card is added or removed from the system; this flexing eventually causes mechanical failures. A backplane does not suffer from this problem, so its <b>service</b> <b>life</b> is <b>limited</b> only by the longevity of its connectors. For example, the DIN 41612 connectors used in the VMEbus system can withstand 50 to 500 insertions and removals (called mating cycles), depending on their quality. To transmit information, Serial Back-Plane technology uses a low voltage differential signaling transmission method for sending information.|$|R

In order to overcome the problem, in this work, a novel polymerization system of activators generated by electron transfer for atom transfer radical polymerization (AGET ATRP) for synchronous separation of the metal catalyst and byproduct of reducing agent was developed, using thiol-grafted cellulose paper (Cell-SH) as a solid reducing agent. The polymerization kinetics were investigated in detail, and the “living” features of the novel polymerization system were confirmed by chain-end analysis and chain extension experiment for the resultant polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA).

40|$|The {{methodology}} for Reliability-Based Design and Assessment (RBDA) of an ageing fixed steel offshore structure {{was established to}} support detailed re-assessment applied to {{the management of the}} structure's safety, integrity analysis and reliability by evaluating the loading acting on the structure. It is a tool for the high-end analysis of the structure for risk-based design assessment and has been succesfully implemented in the North Sea under Shell operating company. The main purposes of RBDA are to manage a structure's risk level over its remaining <b>service</b> <b>life</b> and to initiate the cost-efficient inspection or mitigation actions (if required). This method consists of Type I and II uncertainties used to determine the probability of failure for the structure over its remaining <b>service</b> <b>life.</b> However, <b>limited</b> work has been done so far on its application at many different regions, particularly in the South East Asia. Therefore, this paper investigates the robustness of the RBDA methodology applied to fixed offshore structures at shallow waters of Malaysia by considering the native environmental criteria, local authorities' obligation and company requirements.

Despite the heavy reliance of our society on polymers, the mechanism of their degradation upon exposure to environmental oxidants is barely understood. In this work, model systems of important structural motifs in commercial high-performing polyesters were used to study the reaction with the night-time free radical oxidant NO 3 • in the absence and presence of other radical and non-radical oxidants. Identification of the products revealed ‘hot spots’ in polyesters that are particularly vulnerable to attack by NO 3 • and insight into the mechanism of oxidative damage by this environmentally important radical.

Since an induction lamp has no electrodes, it can have a very long <b>service</b> <b>life.</b> For induction lamp systems with a separate ballast, the <b>service</b> <b>life</b> can be as long as 100,000 hours, which is 11.4 years continuous operation. For induction lamps with integrated ballast, the lifespan is in the 15,000 to 50,000 hours range. Extremely high-quality electronic circuits are needed for the ballast to attain such a long <b>service</b> <b>life.</b> Such lamps are typically used in commercial or industrial applications. Typically operations and maintenance costs are significantly lower with induction lighting systems due to their industry average 100,000 hour life cycle and five to ten year warranty.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe P- 3 <b>service</b> <b>life</b> extension program (SLEP) served {{to extend the}} P- 3 ’s capabilities. The P- 3 fulfilled a wide breadth of mission sets, ranging from overland ground troops support to littoral surveillance to hunting submarines. Answering the demand for multi-mission capability, the 24 -year-old P- 3 entered a sustained readiness program (SRP), extending its airframe from its current 29 - year <b>service</b> <b>life</b> to its <b>limited</b> fatigue <b>life</b> of 38 years. Unexpected findings, however, arose during SRP. The P- 3 s had so much corrosion that SRP contract could not sustain the 221 aircraft fleet. As such, the aircraft went through a <b>service</b> <b>life</b> assessment program (SLAP) to determine not only {{the severity of the}} corrosion problem, but also the structural life remaining on the airframe. In addition, SLAP offered corrective structural remedies if the aircraft were suitable for SLEP. SLAP results were promising: The airframe can be extended by another lifetime. With new wings and a fatigue life management program, the P- 3 could safely execute its missions for an additional two decades, satisfying the constant demand. Five years into SLEP, however, many P- 3 s were grounded due to out-of-tolerance wing cracks, leaving a third of its fleet on the ramp. This thesis analyzes the challenges of SLEP.

40|$|Concrete {{structures}} {{are exposed to}} carbonation that may cause rapid decay, shortening their <b>service</b> <b>life</b> and raising maintenance and repair costs. Carbonation lowers the alkalinity of the concrete depassivating the steel reinforcement. Two limit states can be identified with regard to <b>service</b> <b>life.</b> The first <b>limit</b> state ends when the steel is depassivated. The second limit state is based on cracking of the concrete cover due to oxides generated during corrosion. The <b>service</b> <b>life</b> includes a certain propagation period of corrosion during which the cross-sectional area of steel is progressively decreased, the bond between steel and concrete is reduced and the effective cross-sectional area of concrete is diminished due to spalling of the cover. Surface treatment is commonly used to improve the resistance of concrete to carbonation. A barrier is formed retarding the carbonation reactions {{in the interior of}} the concrete. In this study surface protected concretes were compared with non-protected concretes. The used surface protected concretes presented generally lower carbonation diffusion coefficients than the non-protected concretes. The use of epoxy resin showed better protection than the use of acrylic and siloxane resins. The composition of the concretes is an important factor affecting the diffusion of carbonation. The influence of the water–cement ratio was very important. The carbonation diffusion coefficients increased with the water–cement ratio. The prescriptive methodology is not a guarantee to obtain the desired service lives of 50 or 100 years. The desired services lives were only obtained with the use of surface protection treatments...|$|R

Present work evaluates the critical stress intensity factor K 1 C of AISI D 6 tool steel with and without heat treatment, using the three point bending test of a notched beam or SENB specimen. Initially, a pre-crack was performed by fatigue in the notched specimen assembled in a pre-cracking mechanical equipment developed in laboratory. The fracture toughness tests were carried out in SENB specimen according to the ASTM E 399 standard. The Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics approach was used to calculate fracture toughness of D 6 tool steel heat treated and the Compliance Method of Non-linear Fracture Mechanics was utilised for calculating fracture toughness of D 6 tool steel as received. The material microstructures were characterised by micrographs in an optical microscope and the ruptured surface was examined by SEM photographs. The obtained fracture toughness medium values KIC were 25. 9 MPam 1 / 2 and 44 MPam 1 / 2 respectively for AISI D 6 heat treated and as received, indicating a decrease in ductility due the heat treatment.

40|$|The German Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) has {{established}} a testing guideline to assess the suitability of geosynthetic or geocomposite drain (GCD) elements for final landfill cover systems. In an earlier paper the uniform procedure according to the BAM guideline for determining long-term water flow capacity was described, and the structural stability of drain cores under creep was investigated. The extrapolation of creep curves is permissible only when it can be shown, over the extrapolated period (at least 100 years), that oxidative aging does not invoke any relevant changes in the polyolefin material. This can be shown by measuring antioxidant depletion and mechanical degradation of the drain cores and filter/protection geotextiles in oven aging and water immersion tests.
