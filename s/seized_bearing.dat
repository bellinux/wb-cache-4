50|$|The 1971 Salem, Illinois, {{derailment}} {{occurred on}} June 10, 1971, when Amtrak's City of New Orleans passenger train derailed near Salem, Illinois. It is {{sometimes referred to}} as the Tonti derailment, after the unincorporated community of Tonti, Illinois, which is nearer to the crash site. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the derailment was caused by a false flange on a flat wheel caused by a <b>seized</b> axle <b>bearing.</b> The crash killed 11 people and injured 163. It was Amtrak's first fatal accident since assuming control of most intercity passenger trains in the United States on May 1, 1971.|$|R
50|$|Internal combustions engines require {{lubrication}} {{in operation}} that moving parts slide smoothly over each other. Insufficient lubrication subjects {{the parts of}} the engine to metal-to-metal contact, friction, heat build-up, rapid wear often culminating in parts becoming friction welded together e.g. pistons in their cylinders. Big end <b>bearings</b> <b>seizing</b> up will sometimes lead to a connecting rod breaking and poking out through the crankcase.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, Arfons {{returned}} {{once again}} to Bonneville, but reached an average speed of only 554.017 mph (891.604 km/h). On run number seven at 8:03 a.m. on November 17, Arfons crashed his vehicle travelling 610 mph (982 km/h) when a wheel <b>bearing</b> <b>seized.</b> He subsequently built another Green Monster land speed record car, but sold it to California rancher Slick Gardner without ever driving it.|$|R
50|$|Both gas {{and liquid}} {{lubricants}} can transfer heat. However, liquid lubricants {{are much more}} effective on account of their high specific heat capacity. Typically the liquid lubricant is constantly circulated to and from a cooler part of the system, although lubricants {{may be used to}} warm as well as to cool when a regulated temperature is required. This circulating flow also determines the amount of heat that is carried away in any given unit of time. High flow systems can carry away a lot of heat and have the additional benefit of reducing the thermal stress on the lubricant. Thus lower cost liquid lubricants may be used. The primary drawback is that high flows typically require larger sumps and bigger cooling units. A secondary drawback is that a high flow system that relies on the flow rate to protect the lubricant from thermal stress is susceptible to catastrophic failure during sudden system shut downs. An automotive oil-cooled turbocharger is a typical example. Turbochargers get red hot during operation and the oil that is cooling them only survives as its residence time in the system is very short (i.e. high flow rate). If the system is shut down suddenly (pulling into a service area after a high-speed drive and stopping the engine) the oil that is in the turbo charger immediately oxidizes and will clog the oil ways with deposits. Over time these deposits can completely block the oil ways, reducing the cooling with the result that the turbo charger experiences total failure, typically with <b>seized</b> <b>bearings.</b> Non-flowing lubricants such as greases and pastes are not effective at heat transfer although they do contribute by reducing the generation of heat in the first place.|$|R

5000|$|After his {{conquest of}} Siwistan, Chach called on Agham Lohana, ruler of Brahmanabad, to {{acknowledge}} his sovereignty. A short time later, Chach's soldiers <b>seized</b> a messenger <b>bearing</b> letters from Agham to Matta. The correspondence revealed that Matta {{had decided to}} defect from Chach's service and was to travel to Brahmanabad, {{where he would be}} granted asylum and given a residence. Matta, realizing that his plans had been discovered, fled Siwistan for the safety of Zābul. [...] The tense situation between Alor and Brahmanabad later escalated into war, and Agham was killed in battle.|$|R
50|$|Back on the track, Fittipaldi was now 15 seconds behind Lauda, Jarier {{had retired}} with a <b>seized</b> rear wheel <b>bearing,</b> Brambilla dropped back to seventh {{suffering}} from loose seat supports, and Hunt, Mass, Peterson and Scheckter were battling for third. Mass overtook Hunt on lap 33. With nine laps to go, Peterson also passed Hunt, who {{was struggling with}} his gear selection and brake balance. Three laps from the finish, Mass's brakes began to fade, and Peterson closed, but locked up his left front tire under braking. The resulting flat spot slowed him enough for Hunt to retake fourth on the last lap. Lauda took the win by just under five seconds.|$|R
50|$|On 5 January 1956, {{the second}} YH-16 test {{aircraft}} crashed while returning to Philadelphia from a test flight over New Jersey. The {{cause of the}} crash was later determined to be the aft slip ring, which carried flight data from the instrumented rotor blades to the data recorders in the cabin. The slip ring <b>bearings</b> <b>seized,</b> and the resultant torque load severed the instrumentation standpipe inside the aft rotor shaft. A segment of this steel standpipe tilted over and {{came into contact with}} the interior of the aluminum rotor shaft, scribing a deepening groove into it. The rotor shaft eventually failed in flight, which in turn led to the aft blades and forward blades desynchronizing and colliding.|$|R
50|$|The first {{high-speed}} run {{was planned}} for 7 March 1977, {{the day after}} Noble's thirty-first birthday. A successful first run was made from a standing start at idle thrust and gradual acceleration, reaching an estimated top speed of 180 mph. The second run was planned to be a drag start, with thrust built up against the brakes and then released. At around 140 mph though, a rear-wheel <b>bearing</b> <b>seized</b> and the car went sideways, then rolled. The triple roll was mostly airborne and the car landed on its side, with relatively little damage. Noble was unhurt. The Derwent engine, and its protruding combustion chambers, took much of the damage. The jetpipe broke loose {{and at least one}} combustion chamber was crumpled.|$|R
5000|$|On December 28, 2016, a S-92 (registration G-WNSR, {{serial number}} 920250) {{operated}} by CHC Helicopter experienced [...] "unexpected control responses" [...] whilst in mid-air {{on a routine}} shuttle flight between two oil installations in the North Sea. The pilots conducted an emergency landing on the West Franklin platform. The helicopter {{is reported to have}} spun on the helideck during the landing, damaging the helicopter wheels and rotor blades. The helideck also sustained damage during the emergency landing. There were no reported injuries amongst the nine passengers and two crew during the incident. The aircraft was transported back to Aberdeen via ship, at which time the Air Accidents Investigation Branch began their investigation into the incident. Sikorsky issued a notice on January 9, 2017 grounding all S-92 aircraft until the tail rotors have been inspected. The inspection work takes approximately 11 man hours to complete. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch issued an update on January 11, 2017 which reported that the tail rotor pitch change shaft <b>bearing</b> had <b>seized.</b> The <b>bearing</b> showed signs of severe overheating and significant wear. The failure of the bearing allowed the tail rotor driveshaft to damage the tail rotor servo. The damage to the tail rotor servo is considered to be the cause of tail rotor control. The health and usage monitoring systems had discovered the flaw the day before flight, but the maintenance crew had not.|$|R
5000|$|Aristomachus {{was summoned}} to Alexandria. [...] "Aristomachus ... {{proceeded}} {{to the city of}} Alexandria with only a few attendants; for he was not aware of the treacherous device they had prepared against him. And when the patriarch and Andrew saw him, they were delighted, and got ready a light ship on the sea close at hand to the Church of St. Mark the Evangelist. Then they celebrated ... the festival of St. Mark the Evangelist. And {{at the close of the}} divine service, Andrew went forth accompanied by Aristomachus and walked towards the seashore. And thereupon Andrew made a signal to his attendants and to the soldiers to seize Aristomachus and to cast him into the vessel. And immediately they <b>seized</b> him, and, <b>bearing</b> him on their shoulders, cast him into the vessel, without his being aware (of the reason), and loosing thence they set sail to go to the emperor." ...|$|R

50|$|He {{was also}} {{involved}} with car racing, driving MGs and Rileys. In 1934 {{he joined the}} MG works team and in the 1934 BRDC International Trophy Race at Brooklands, Handley drove well until a back axle broke late in the race. Later in 1934 he co-drove Eyston's MG K3 'Magic Magnette', but crashed on the Railway Straight when an axle <b>bearing</b> <b>seized.</b> It was in September 1934 that he raced an N type MG Magnette in the Ards TT in Northern Ireland in the International RAC Sports Car Race but had to retire with engine trouble. In 1934 and in 1935 he raced MGs in the Isle of Man Mannin Beg 'round the houses' event. In 1934 he led on the first lap with the MG Magnette but had a crash and retired shortly afterwards. In the following year he entered the Mannin Beg with the 745cc MGR but retired with axle failure.|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years the iron base {{sintered}} bearings production was considerable increased {{at the expense of}} the copper based ones, due to the low cost and availability of the iron powders as well as the higher strength. The mechanical properties of a part are strongly related to the composition of the materials. For tribological applications, the properties of the surface are related to the different metallic and intermetallic phases formed in the material. The friction nature of the bearing type couple having the bearing bush made from sintered material is a function of pores size, applied load, velocity, temperature, the quality and quantity of the stored oil and can appear as hydrodynamic, mixed and limit friction. The tribological features of the selected iron-copper based materials have been studied using an experimental device for wear testing of the sliding bearings. The friction coefficient and wear resistance have been analyzed in dry friction conditions. The influence of the applied load and p x v values on the friction coefficient was studied. Also, the dependence of the functioning time until the failure of the <b>bearing</b> (<b>seizing)</b> with the friction coefficient for the applied forces was analyzed...|$|R
5000|$|All of Alfred Scales's Civil War {{service was}} with Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Soon after {{the call for}} troops from Washington he volunteered as a private in the North Carolina service, but was at once elected captain of his company, H of the 13th North Carolina Infantry Regiment, and was elected to succeed General William Dorsey Pender as colonel on November 14, 1862. He was engaged at Yorktown and the Battle of Williamsburg in the Peninsula Campaign, and in the Seven Days Battles near Richmond. After Malvern Hill, he {{collapsed}} from exhaustion and came near to death. His superior, Brig. Gen. Samuel Garland, Jr., said in his report that Scales was [...] "conspicuous for his fine <b>bearing.</b> <b>Seizing</b> the colors of his regiment at a critical moment at Cold Harbor and advancing to the front, he called on the 13th to stand to them, thus restoring confidence and keeping his men in position." [...] It took him until November to recuperate so he missed the battles of both Second Manassas and Antietam, but returned {{in time for the}} battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this effort is to develop, build and test a high-speed drilling motor that can meet the performance guidelines of the announcement, namely: 'The motors are expected to rotate at a minimum of 10, 000 rpm, have an OD no larger than 7 inches and work downhole continuously for at least 100 hours. The motor must have common oilfield thread connections capable of making up to a drill bit and bottomhole assembly. The motor must be capable of transmitting drilling fluid through the motor'. To these goals, APS would add that the motor must be economically viable, {{in terms of both}} its manufacturing and maintenance costs, and be applicable to as broad a range of markets as possible. APS has taken the approach of using a system using planetary gears to increase the speed of a conventional mud motor to 10, 000 rpm. The mud flow is directed around the outside of the gear train, and a unique flow diversion system has been employed. A prototype of the motor was built and tested in APS's high-pressure flow loop. The motor operated per the model up to {approx} 4200 rpm. At that point a <b>bearing</b> <b>seized</b> and the performance was severely degraded. The motor is being rebuilt and will be retested outside of this program...|$|R
