Her father later stated {{that she had}} been in great spirits, because of her new flat in Holloway, north London, which she had decorated, and there was a {{possibility}} of a career upturn after a few years of a career stall. Later that evening, she complained of feeling unwell, but went home to her flat against her parents' advice. The next morning, Wednesday, 14 November 2001, her parents telephoned her to see if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> better; but there was no reply.

To comply, fashion designer Monique Lhuillier [...] "incorporated elements of three dresses Moore loved" [...] into the final dress, resulting in a full-skirted cobalt blue gown. Moore revealed that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> confident about the performance [...] "until about two minutes before the show".

I Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained {{that the idea of}} filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> lonely, stating [...] "there was one moment I was in China and I was in this huge suite and I {{looked out the window and}} there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't believe my life... I guess I was a bit lonely and I wanted to talk to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." [...] Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side.

500|$|A President Aaron Bay-Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and {{producers}} J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels {{to work with}} Stefani on the album. Stefani recalled saying the following to them during a recording session: [...] "'Listen, I don’t care about anything. I don’t care about hits. I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all I {{want to do is}} just say the truth. I just want the truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down of all of these things <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why I cry but I think it's because I remembered {{for the first time since}} I hated you that I used to love you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E

500|$|Milian {{wrote the}} hip-hop ballad [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] about [...] "thinking that I had {{something}} good, {{what happens when}} it's over, and going forward with my life." [...] The track {{was one of the}} final songs that Milian wrote about the break-up as it [...] "helped me get it all out". While the record is about a break-up, it focuses more on closure and moving past it. Milian and Cool & Dre used the melody of the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony song [...] "Tha Crossroads" [...] and changed the lyrics [...] "and I'm gonna miss everybody" [...] to [...] "and I'm gonna tell everybody". The other song, [...] "Who's Gonna Ride", has a more street and gangster vibe, and contain more raw lyrics. Milian wrote the track with Dre, which she said helped because hip hop artists write about real things in their lives and are not afraid to say anything. While writing the track, Milian let her guard down and wrote what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> and tried to be real. Lyrically, the song also deals with [...] "the girls that come around and try to take your man. Or the groupie girls that are around, paying attention to the guys on TV that only hang out with them for those reasons." [...] Milian also said [...] "Who's Gonna Ride" [...] was the hardest song to write because it was not safe, unlike previous songs she had written. The singer explained writing the lyrics was not hard, but the difficulty came from being real and actually writing about her true feelings. When writing the lyrics, Milian removed several lines that she thought were too harsh.|$|E
2500|$|As a child, Lorde {{struggled}} with communication, {{and came to}} appreciate the power of poetry {{as a form of}} expression. She memorized a great deal of poetry, and would use it to communicate, to the extent that, [...] "If asked how <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling,</b> Audre would reply by reciting a poem." [...] Around the age of twelve, she began writing her own poetry and connecting with others at her school who were considered [...] "outcasts," [...] as she felt she was.|$|E
2500|$|... "Suitcase" [...] is {{the eighth}} {{song on the}} album. She was singing the line [...] "he's got a blue face" [...] and Sandé thought it sounded like the word [...] "suitcase". Then at that moment, a whole story came out, and said at that moment {{she was trying to}} express how <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling,</b> subconsciously almost. About a month ago (when the song was written) she and her fiancé had a falling out {{and it was a very}} hard time for her. She just wrote how she felt about that.|$|E

2500|$|Vlasic {{started the}} season {{well with a}} bronze medal {{performance}} at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships in March. She regularly reached the podium at meetings in the outdoor season and won the 2004 national championships. A Croatian record breaking jump of 2.03m in Ljubljana put her in good stead for the 2004 Athens Olympics. However, when she competed at the [...] Olympic high jump final she only managed eleventh place with a jump of 1.89m. Following this, Vlašić did not compete for almost a year: she admitted that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> lethargic and shortly afterwards {{she was diagnosed with}} a hyperthyroid condition.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked what}} made her singing style unique, she once said [...] "my feeling for a lyric, I'm a storyteller and I try to have {{excellent}} diction so you don't have to guess what I'm saying. Some people listen to a song for years and don't know what the lyric is." [...] In 1965 while listening to “Violets For Your Furs” by Billie Holiday, Alexandria said:"There’s not too much left to say about Billie Holiday, {{how is it possible}} for a woman to be this great? This comes from a period when she wasn’t supposed to be singing too well but I’ve never heard anything by her that I didn’t realize what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> which is very important regardless of the shape of the pipes or what may be happening [...] She always got the message across. She never failed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the release}} of Rihanna's seventh studio album, Unapologetic (2012) and its {{accompanying}} tour, the singer aimed to take a hiatus from recording music. She stated, [...] "I {{wanted to have a}} year to just do whatever I want artistically, creatively." [...] However, the hiatus did not last long and after a week she returned to the studio. During the initial writing and development of the album, Rihanna wasn't sure how she wanted Anti to sound. Ultimately, she decided that she wants [...] "honest" [...] music and a body of work that reflected and represented her at that time. However, the singer stated that during the recording process she was evolving and she didn't have the answer of who she was at that point. According to her, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> disconnected from her emotions and [...] "numb" [...] during the album's conception. During her creative struggle, Rihanna rented a house in Malibu over a couple of months and started extensively writing and composing music with her team consisted of various musicians. Reflecting on this Rihanna stated: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Mrs. Hastings; [...] "I {{want you}} to do it. I've reasons for believing that your {{influence}} would go further with her than mine. For one thing, I fancy <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> rather ashamed of herself." ...|$|R

Hilary said she refrained from co-writing the entire album because [...] "I don't know if I'm secure enough with myself to do that". She has characterised [...] "Haters" [...] as [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] and said people would {{know what it is}} about when they heard it, and it {{attracted}} substantial publicity when rumors circulated that it was about actress Lindsay Lohan, with whom Duff was alleged to have been feuding. The Scoop, a gossip section of the website MSNBC, quoted an insider who had said, [...] "Hilary thinks that Lindsay has been directing negativity at her for too long." [...] Duff denied that the rumors were true, saying she did not know Lohan and would not write a song about her. She said that at the time she wrote it <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> she had to openly discuss her personal life because [...] "people make accusations and there are lies and rumors constantly ... people are so negative. They love to read what's coming out next on Page Six [...] and I just felt like it was appropriate." [...] She said she felt [...] "normal girls" [...] could relate to the song because of the [...] "petty stuff" [...] that occurs in schools.|$|E
2500|$|... is an {{artificial}} intelligence owned by Hitoshi Sora as the automatic pilot of his spaceship. Her first appearance has her in disembodied form as the navigator of Hitoshi's ship {{and she is}} responsible for the crash landing on Earth and for killing Hazumu. When Hitoshi comes to Earth to live in Hazumu's house, he constructs a gynoid modeled after Hazumu's own new female body, so Jan Pu looks {{about the same age as}} Hazumu, and their faces bear a striking resemblance. Jan Pu has the unique ability of levitation, and is able to bend light around her so others cannot see her. Other than technically being {{an artificial}} being, she generally acts like a human child due to being enthusiastic about meeting new people and possessing little to no social skills for a girl who looks to be the age of seventeen. At home, Hazumu and Jan Pu have been known to take baths together and they sleep together in the same bed every night. Additionally, Jan Pu can eat and finds curry to be delicious. Hazumu's parents take an instant liking to Jan Pu since now they have two girls to dress up and take pictures of. When Jan Pu meets Hazumu's friends for the first time, she is introduced as Hazumu's cousin. Jan Pu loves Hazumu very much, and Hitoshi even had to give her a definition for [...] "love" [...] once she came to Earth in order to describe the emotion <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> for Hazumu.

2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
