5|$|From the 2007–08 season onwards, former <b>Slovenian</b> internationals Zlatko Zahovič as {{the sport}} director, and soon afterwards, Darko Milanič {{as the head}} coach, were {{appointed}} to head the club's sports department. On 10 May 2008, the club re-opened the renovated Ljudski vrt, which had undergone a major reconstruction that lasted almost 20months. The first match played in the newly refurbished stadium was a league match against Nafta and was won 3–1 in front of 12,435spectators. At the start of 2008–09 season, Maribor entered history books as the first club who won 1,000points in the <b>Slovenian</b> top division, after a 2–1 away win against Rudar Velenje on 26 July 2008. Under the guidance of head coach Darko Milanič, Maribor won all three domestic trophies available to them (the <b>Slovenian</b> League, Cup, and Supercup) in only two seasons with the club, thus becoming the first coach with all three domestic trophies won in <b>Slovenian</b> football. On 12 December 2010, the club celebrated its 50th anniversary. With the 2–1 away victory over Primorje, on 21 May 2011, Maribor secured its ninth <b>Slovenian</b> league title. Four days later the team played the <b>Slovenian</b> cup final at Stožice stadium and lost to Domžale 4–3.|$|E
5|$|Maribor is {{the most}} {{successful}} club in the country, having won 14 <b>Slovenian</b> PrvaLiga titles, nine <b>Slovenian</b> Cups, and four <b>Slovenian</b> Supercups. The club's most successful period was in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when they overwhelmingly dominated domestic football, winning seven successive league titles and three national cups. Following the 2008–09 season, Maribor became the dominant force in <b>Slovenian</b> football for the second time, having won seven out of nine championships since then. Prior to Slovenia's independence in 1991, Maribor played in the Yugoslav football system, where the club, apart from winning the Yugoslav second division in 1967, had no major successes. They are {{one of only three}} <b>Slovenian</b> teams which participated in the country's highest division, Yugoslav First League, between the end of World War II in 1945 and the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991. In addition, they are the only <b>Slovenian</b> club to have participated in the group stages of the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|Maribor's {{tally of}} 14 <b>Slovenian</b> Championships {{and the total}} of nine <b>Slovenian</b> Cup titles is the highest in <b>Slovenian</b> football. Maribor holds the record for most {{consecutive}} league titles (7), ahead of Olimpija (4) and Gorica (3). They are also the only team {{in the country that}} has achieved the <b>Slovenian</b> Championship and the <b>Slovenian</b> Cup doubles {{on more than one occasion}} (4). In addition, they are the only club who has won the <b>Slovenian</b> version of the treble, having won the league, cup and supercup during the 2012–13 season. On their official website, UEFA states that Maribor has won one international cup, as Maribor was one of the winners of the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2006. However, the trophy itself was awarded to Newcastle United, the team that advanced farthest in the UEFA competitions that season. Maribor have the best top-flight record in history, having finished below fourth place only once.

The Gottscheer were given Reich passports and transportation to the Rann area just after the forced departure of the <b>Slovenians.</b> Most Gottschee left their homes due to coercion and threats since the VoMi had a deadline of December 31, 1941 for the mass movement of both groups. Though many Gottscheer did receive farmland and households, these were of lesser quality than their own, and many were in disarray from the hasty forced expulsion of the <b>Slovenians.</b>|$|R
