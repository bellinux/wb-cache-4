50|$|The SIG MG 710-3 is an automatic, {{air-cooled}} belt-fed weapon {{operated by}} roller-delayed blowback and fires {{from an open}} bolt. The machine gun's bolt differs from other contemporary designs employing the short recoil method of operation (such as CETME and Heckler & Koch designed weapons), being a 3-piece design that consists of a bolt head with two locking rollers, a striker sleeve and the bolt carrier which is connected telescopically with the bolt head. When a round is chambered pressure from the return spring drives the bolt and carrier assembly forward; simultaneously both rollers engage camming surfaces which drive the rollers outward from their compressed travel position into recesses in the barrel extension. Upon firing, the bolt carrier and striker assembly recoil to the rear and the geometry of the fixed camming <b>surfaces</b> <b>drives</b> the rollers inward unlocking the bolt breech and increasing {{the speed at which}} the striker sleeve withdraws relative to the bolt. As the slower bolt continues rearward it impacts the returning striker sleeve (this impact decelerates the bolt).|$|E

We show that the chemical environment for surfaces containing {{less than half of}} one monolayer of Zn is chemically distinct from subsequent layers. Surfaces where the deposition is performed at room temperature contain ZnPd islands surrounded by a substrate with dilute Zn substitutions.

Toenhancetheirintegration {{with the}} bones of the jaws, the {{surfaces}} of titanium dental implants are modified to make them hydrophilic, high energy, and microtextured. These same features make biofilm development occur readily upon exposure to the saliva. The presence of mature biofilms on dental implant <b>surfaces</b> <b>drives</b> local inflammatory responses in the adjacent soft and hard tissues (peri-implantitis), which leads to pathological loss of bone and the formation of a saucer shaped bone defects. This chapter examines the unique challenges posed by biofilms formed on highly complex dental implant surfaces, which are difficult to access for cleaning, and easily damaged by conventional cleaning approaches. We explore how biofilms can be removed from implant surfaces using a variety of novel methods, without causing surface damage or other undesirable modifications, and show how different laboratory and clinical models can be used to assess the performance of both conventional and novel methods of biofilm removal...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{that drives the}} segregation of cells into tissue-specific subpopulations during development is largely attributed to differences in intercellular adhesion. This process requires the cadherin family of calcium-dependent glycoproteins. A widely held view is that protein-level discrimination between different cadherins on cell <b>surfaces</b> <b>drives</b> this sorting process. Despite this postulated molecular selectivity, adhesion selectivity has not been quantitatively verified at the protein level. In this work, molecular force measurements and bead aggregation assays tested whether differences in cadherin bond strengths could account for cell sorting in vivo and in vitro. Studies were conducted with chicken N-cadherin, canine E-cadherin, and Xenopus C-cadherin. Both qualitative bead aggregation and quantitative force measurements show that the cadherins cross-react. Furthermore, heterophilic adhesion is not substantially weaker than homophilic adhesion, and the measured differences in adhesion do not correlate with cell sorting behavior. These {{results suggest that the}} basis for cell segregation during morphogenesis does not map exclusively to protein-level differences in cadherin adhesion...|$|E

40|$|Subject of investigation: {{development}} of {{the design of the}} rig of a screw submersible pump with a <b>surface</b> <b>drive</b> for enhancing the effectiveness of operation of wells with complicated conditions. Analytical dependences are obtained for pressure losses for the hydraulic resistance in the screw hyrotor-type pump, and for the maximum permissible rotational speed of the rotor, which interconnect the technological and operational factors. Consideration is given to the energy balance of the rig. The investigation deals with the influence of the fluid viscosity on the pump characteristic with a kinetic ratio of 9 : 10.
