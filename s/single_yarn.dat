40|$|Solospun is a {{spinning}} technology which provides {{the means to}} produce a <b>singles</b> <b>yarn</b> that can be successfully woven as either warp or weft. The technology is a versatile and cost effective alternative to two-folding, Sirospun or sizing. It offers significant benefits in terms of efficiency and productivity. Solospun is a simple, inexpensive, clip-on attachment for the spinning of long staple, weavable <b>singles</b> <b>yarns.</b> The technology {{is the result of}} a joint development between CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology, The Woolmark Company and WRONZ and was commercially released in 1998. It is now successfully operating in worsted mills worldwide. The Solospun hardware consists of a pair of rollers held in a bracket, which is clipped onto the front of the pendulum-drafting arm. Each roller is positioned immediately below, and parallel to, each top front draft roller where it interacts with the emerging drafted fibre strand before twist insertion. The roller-fibre interaction subtly changes the structure of the yarn, which dramatically increases its abrasion resistance. This allows Solospun yarns to be woven without two-folding or sizing, providing significant cost savings. Depending on fabric structure, weaving performance is equivalent to that of conventional two-fold yarns. Fabrics woven from Solospun yarns are of good quality and appearance. Some aspects, including preferred hand and FAST results, are equal or superior to two-fold yarn fabrics. As with compact and condensed spinning, Solospun offers significant reductions in yarn hairiness. However, Solospun can be simply implemented on existing spinning frames and goes much further by making the <b>singles</b> <b>yarns</b> weavable...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates a {{multispectral}} imaging {{approach to}} colour measurement and colour matching of single yarns. The {{small size of}} a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> {{makes it impossible for}} spectrophotometers directly to acquire its spectral reflectance. Multispectral imaging systems, on the other hand, have the potential to measure the reflectance of single yarns as they can record both the spectral and the spatial information of a sample. A multispectral imaging system, namely imaging colour measurement, has been developed to conduct colour measurement of single yarns. A <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> is first detected from backgrounds by a modified K-means clustering method. The reflectance of the <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> is then specified by an averaging method. Comparative experiments based on 100 pairs of single yarns and corresponding yarn windings show that the reflectance magnitude of a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> acquired by imaging colour measurement is smaller than that of corresponding yarn winding measured by a Datacolor 650 spectrophotometer. Experiments on 16 single yarns show that the repeatability and spatial reproducibility of the imaging colour measurement system in measuring a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> colour are 0. 1185 and 0. 2827 CMC(2 : 1) units. A colour matching comparison experiment (pass or fail), using 24 pairs of single yarns and corresponding pairs of solid-colour yarn dyed fabrics, shows that single yarns measured by imaging colour measurement can achieve similar colour matching results to solid-colour yarn dyed fabrics measured by the Datacolor 650 spectrophotometer, with degrees of similarity of 87. 5 and 83. 3 % when the CMC(2 : 1) and CIE 2000 (2 : 1 : 1) colour difference formulas are employed.

40|$|Many {{applications}} in textile require color measurement of <b>single</b> strands of <b>yarns</b> due to unavailability {{of a mass}} of consecutive yarns. While multispectral imaging systems can capture images of <b>single</b> strands of <b>yarns,</b> an unavoidable problem accompanied is how to specify their colors from images, in which pixel values vary with positions owing to three-dimensional shape of yarn. Based on the response of multispectral imaging systems to <b>single</b> strands of <b>yarns,</b> this article formulates the color specification problem as an optimization question and four methods are proposed: average of all pixels (AA), average of pixels in central area (AC), maxima of all pixels (MA), and lightness weighting method (LW). The first experiment analyzed color distribution of pixels on a <b>single</b> strand of <b>yarn.</b> Experimental results show pixels in central area have smallest color variation and largest intensity. The second experiment compared the proposed methods. Results show that CIEXYZ, L*, and C* values specified by the AA and MA methods are lowest and highest.
