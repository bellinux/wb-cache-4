40|$|The {{viewpoints}} of 30 Cape Verdean fishermen {{are used}} {{together with an}} analysis of the state of tuna stocks in the Atlantic Ocean to question the EU's claim that their fleet only targets <b>surplus</b> <b>species.</b> Additionally, local marine catches of the artisanal and semi-industrial fleet are evaluated and the importance of the fisheries sector for the inhabitants of Cape Verde is shown. It is argued that even though the EU condemns illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU); their approach to stop IUU fails. In order to support this hypothesis, monitoring of the European fleet, movements of tuna fish and coverage of recent Fisheries Partnership Agreements (FPAs) are analysed. Finally, the prevalence of fisheries subsidies is discussed. Here, the focus is set on those subsidies embedded in two FPAs between the EU and Cape Verde. It is concluded that the subsidies provided by the EU to their fleet increase the problem of overfishing in Cape Verde. A theoretical solution is discussed and it is proposed that the external component of the European fisheries policy, namely Fisheries Partnership Agreements, has to change toward an association that deserves the name partnership...|$|E
40|$|A {{generalization}} of discrete logistic growth model is considered. Constant harvesting {{for human consumption}} of species is taken into account. At the same time, forced reproduction {{of the same species}} is also considered. The constant cycle of forced pregnancy and birth creates a huge <b>surplus</b> of <b>species.</b> A general framework of fixed point’s stability is carried out taking all possible conditions of harvesting and reproduction. For evenness, limited harvesting as well as balanced forced reproduction is advisable...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} is best {{considered as}} {{the level of}} human appropriation of terrestrial net primary production. The global value is set to increase from 30 %, increasing pressures on biodiversity. The pressures can be classified in terms of spatial scale, i. e. land cover, landscape management and crop management. Different lowland agricultural landscapes in Great Britain show differences among these pressures when habitat diversity and nutrient surplus are used as indicators. Eutrophication of plants was correlated to N <b>surplus,</b> and <b>species</b> richness of plants correlated with broad habitat diversity. Bird species diversity only correlated with habitat diversity when the diversity of different agricultural habitats was taken into account. The pressures of agricultural change may be reduced by minimizing loss of large habitats, minimizing permanent loss of agricultural land, maintaining habitat diversity in agricultural landscapes in order to provide ecosystem services, and minimizing pollution from nutrients and pesticides from the crops themselves. While these pressures could potentially be quantified using an internationally consistent set of indicators, their impacts would need to be assessed using a much larger number of locally applicable biodiversity indicators...|$|R
40|$|Some scyphozoan {{species have}} a few peculiarities and these are {{reflected}} in their life cycles (e. g. type or seasonality of strobilations) (see more in Berrill, 1949 and Silveira et al., 2003). For the scyphozoan order Coronatae, the solitary polyps are hypothesized to strobilate under conditions of energy <b>surplus,</b> while colonial <b>species</b> tend to strobilate in determined periods (Werner, 1970). The strobilation process of the scyphozoans is a relevant morphological event that helps understanding the evolution and relationships of other taxonomic groups (see more in Berrill, 1949 and Collins et al., 2006). The variety of reproductive traits is very interesting and, unfortunately, quite overlooked in Scyphozoa (see more in Arai, 1997) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} analyzes {{a proposed}} action that would allocate the ABC surplus (i. e., {{the difference between}} acceptable biological catch and total allowable catch) for flathead sole, rock sole, and yellowfin sole, among the Amendment 80 cooperatives and CDQ groups, using the same formulas {{that are used in}} the annual harvest specifications process. These entities would be able to exchange their flathead sole, rock sole, and/or yellowfin sole quota share for an equivalent amount of their allocation of the ABC <b>surplus</b> for these <b>species.</b> The approach is intended to increase the opportunity for maximizing the harvest of these species, while ensuring that the overall 2 million mt optimum yield, and ABCs for each individual species, are not exceeded. The analysis also includes options to restrict flexibility in the exchange of yellowfin sole, if the analysis shows that there is a potential negative impact of the approach on users of yellowfin sole in the Bering Sea Aleutian Islands trawl limited access sector. The proposed action would amend the Fishery Management Plan fo...|$|R
40|$|In {{the face}} of the current global {{sustainability}} challenge, seeking out and strengthening sustainable alternative methods for community development has become an urgent task for development professionals and academics. In order to explore one of such alternatives, in this thesis I draw on research conducted with the Associación de Desarollo Integral de Ostional (ADIO). Located on Costa Rica’s rural Pacific coast, ADIO was initiated by the local community of Ostional and resulted in the Project of Sustainable Use, Conservation and Management of the Olive Ridley Sea Turtle in 1987. Co-managed by the University of Costa Rica (UCR) and the Ministry of Natural Resources (MINAE), ADIO practices conservation and scientifically monitors the management of the Olive Ridley sea turtle <b>species.</b> <b>Surplus</b> eggs from the turtle arribadas (the mass nesting’s of sea turtles) at the optional beach are being legally harvested and marketed by ADIO. This project has successfully contributed to the protection of the Olive Ridley turtle population whilst returning socio-economic benefits into the community. The aim of this research is {{to gain a better understanding}} of ADIO’s work and the significance of ADIO to the local community. My research draws on the experiences of community members to identify their perception of the benefits of ADIO to their own community, and unpack areas in need of improvement. Qualitative data were collected from community members through: semi structured interviews, participant observation, a reflective workshop, a questionnaire and field notes. The findings of this research identify key elements for the success of ADIO, and demonstrate the benefit of this Project toward the sustainability of the local community. This research demonstrates that socio-economic benefits can be gained through appropriate community participation in sustainable conservation projects, which can further enhance the desire of the local community to be better stewards of natural resources. This thesis seeks to contribute in some small way to an existing body of knowledge on the topics of sustainability, community-run conservation, and development...|$|R
