5|$|Cucurbita {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the Cabbage Moth (Mamestra brassicae), Hypercompe indecisa, and the Turnip Moth (Agrotis segetum). Cucurbita can be susceptible to the pest Bemisia argentifolii (<b>silverleaf</b> whitefly) as well as aphids (Aphididae), cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi), squash bug (Anasa tristis), the squash vine borer (Melittia cucurbitae), and the twospotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.|$|E

500|$|M-18 begins about [...] {{northeast}} of Mount Pleasant at the North Bradley interchange on US10 in rural Midland County. The highway runs due north through woodlands {{that are a}} part of the Au Sable State Forest and into Gladwin County. The trunkline enters the community of Beaverton and turns northwest to cross the section of the Tobacco River known as Ross Lake. Continuing northwesterly, the road runs along a section of the lake and then turns back due northerly. North of Beaverton, M-18 runs through some farm fields as it approaches the county seat of Gladwin. The highway runs through the southwestern outskirts of town near a golf course as it approaches a junction with M-61. M-18 merges with, and runs concurrently along, M-61 eastward into town on Cedar Avenue. At <b>Silverleaf</b> Street, M-18 turns back north near the airport. M-18 continues northward out of town back into farm country.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a period}} of {{ambiguity}} among researchers, {{the consensus is that}} the most likely candidate of CBSD vector is Bemisia tabaci biotype B, the <b>silverleaf</b> whitefly. It is also sometimes referred to as Bemisia argentifolii. [...] There is a close association between surging whitefly populations and CBSD incidence. This whitefly species is also considered to be the vector of CMV. It is suggested, however, that B. tabaci whiteflies transmit CBSVs less effectively than CMVs. Also, the CBSD retention period in B. tabaci may not exceed more than 24 h, but {{more research is needed to}} confirm this.|$|E

2500|$|The Coastal Lowlands {{ecoregion}} contains beaches, {{sand dunes}} and spits, and low marine terraces below [...] elevation. Characteristic features include wet forests, shallow freshwater lakes, estuarine marshes, and low-gradient, meandering tannic streams and rivers. Residential, commercial, and recreational developments are expanding {{in the coastal}} corridor. Many wetlands in the floodplains of the region's streams have been drained and converted into pastures for dairy farms, and associated stream degradation has occurred. Mature forests {{in the region are}} dominated by a canopy of Sitka spruce, western hemlock, and Douglas-fir, with salal, sword fern, vine maple, and Oregon grape in the shrub layer. The riparian zone supports red alder, western redcedar, and bigleaf maple with an understory of salmonberry; California bay-laurel is common in the south. Estuaries and coastal wetlands may feature Baltic rush, Lyngby’s sedge, tufted hairgrass, Pacific <b>silverleaf,</b> and seaside arrowgrass with shore pine, sweet gale, and Hooker’s willow. Stabilized dunes support shore pine over salal, rhododendron, and evergreen blueberry, with dune wildrye, Chilean strawberry, and dune bentgrass. Soil textures range from silty clay loam to sandy loam. The region covers [...] in Oregon and [...] in Washington, with the largest contiguous areas found near Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay, the mouth of the Columbia River, Tillamook Bay, and along the southern Oregon Coast. Public lands include the Grays Harbor, Willapa, Nestucca Bay, Siletz Bay, and Bandon Marsh National Wildlife Refuges, the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, and numerous state parks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>silverleaf</b> {{whitefly}} (Bemisia tabaci, also informally {{referred to}} as the sweetpotato whitefly) is one of several whiteflies that are currently important agricultural pests. The <b>silverleaf</b> whitefly is classified in the family Aleyrodidae, and is included in the large sub-order of insects, Sternorrhyncha.

5000|$|This {{attractive}} shrub has considerable landscaping {{potential in}} areas with a suitable climate and soils. [...] Requiring cool, moist habitats in the shade, <b>silverleaf</b> hydrangea is not as tolerant of the heat and drought as smooth hydrangea. It is also more difficult to root from cuttings than either smooth or ashy hydrangeas. <b>Silverleaf</b> hydrangea produces more showy flowers than smooth hydrangea or ashy hydrangea. <b>Silverleaf</b> hydrangea is suitable for hardiness zones 4 to 9, although highly protected locations would be advisable in areas warmer than zone 6.

50|$|Phacelia hastata is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the borage family, Boraginaceae.

50|$|Another {{important}} {{control is}} the use of other crops as a source of trap crops. Squashes can act as trap crops for the <b>silverleaf</b> whitefly due to the flies’ attraction to these crops. <b>Silverleaf</b> whiteflies are actually more attracted to the squash crop than they are to the tomato plant. When squash serves as a trap crop, the tomato yellow curl leaf virus can be controlled and limited. Scientific experiments show in the fields that growing squash crops around the areas where tomato plants can be found is a useful manipulation in regulating the <b>silverleaf</b> whitefly population as well as the transmission of TYLCV. Other plants that can serve as trap crops include cantaloupe and cucumber.|$|E
