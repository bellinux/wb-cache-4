5000|$|Boiled {{linseed oil}} is a {{combination}} of raw linseed oil, <b>stand</b> <b>oil</b> (see above), and metallic dryers (catalysts to accelerate drying). In the Medieval era, linseed oil was boiled with lead oxide (litharge) to give a product called boiled linseed oil. The lead oxide forms lead [...] "soaps" [...] (lead oxide is alkaline) which promotes hardening (polymerisation) of linseed oil by reaction with atmospheric oxygen. Heating shortens its drying time.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Stand</b> <b>oil</b> is {{generated}} by heating linseed oil near 300 °C {{for a few days}} in the complete absence of air. Under these conditions, the polyunsaturated fatty esters convert to conjugated dienes, which then undergo Diels-Alder reactions, leading to crosslinking. The product, which is highly viscous, gives highly uniform coatings that [...] "dry" [...] to more elastic coatings than linseed oil itself. Soybean oil can be treated similarly, but converts more slowly. On the other hand, tung oil converts very quickly, being complete in minutes at 260 °C. Coatings prepared from stand oils are less prone to yellowing than are coatings derived from the parent oils.|$|E

5000|$|Application: Sansodor is {{a highly}} refined odorless mineral spirit {{that is used to}} dilute (thin) artists' oil paints and is also used to dilute oil media (linseed oils, alkyd media, etc.). To conform to the [...] "fat over lean" [...] rule in oil painting, Sansodor should be {{considered}} a [...] "lean" [...] medium (although, technically it is a thinner) and, therefore, used mostly in the initial layers of a painting. The addition of [...] "fat" [...] media like alkyd (faster drying) and linseed (slower drying) are progressively added into the subsequent layers of the painting in conformance to the [...] "fat over lean" [...] rule. Another guideline to follow is to use faster drying media (like alkyd) in the lower layers of the painting and use slower drying media (like linseed) in the later layers to ensure the bottom layers dry first. Although Sansodor can be used to reduce the viscosity of these media (thick media like <b>stand</b> <b>oil</b> and alkyds) to increase their flow, it should never exceed 50% of any oil paint medium mixture to ensure proper pigment bonding.|$|E

30|$|The {{detection}} of Pinaceae resin in Ripolin paints is perhaps surprising, as critical reading of period technical literature seems {{to imply that}} oil-based enamels including resins in their formulations were considered of lower quality, and Ripolin cans, on the contrary, {{were among the first}} and highest quality enamel paints available in the French market [39]. Historically, the highest quality enamels consisted of only <b>stand</b> <b>oil</b> as vehicle.

40|$|Absolute {{viscosity}} measurements under equilibrium flour {{conditions have}} been obtained for thixotropic suspensions of titanium dioxide pigments in linseed <b>stand</b> <b>oils.</b> These cover a range of shear rates {{and the effects of}} changes in concentration and temperature have been noted. It is shown that over the complete range there are two components of the shearing stress, one which is independent of temperature and another proportional to the viscosity of the medium as this changes with temperature. The temperature independent term {{is in the form of}} a frictional resistance which rises to a limiting value as the rate of shear increases; the other may be regarded as a hydro dynamic viscosity term which decreases to a limiting value with increasing shear. The theoretical significance of the variation in these components with concentration is briefly considered. Thixotropic relaxation has been found to occur in a very complicated way but some approximate measurements on time-dependent viscosities have been made. These indicate how the magnitude and speed of thixotropic change depend upon the equilibrium rate of shear and on concentration...|$|R

Next, the obtained <b>stand</b> <b>oil</b> was functionalized in a two-step one-shot process without solvent {{in order to}} graft on some photopolymerizable groups. The first step consisted of a bulk reaction with maleic anhydride at 220 °C under an inert atmosphere. The grafted anhydride groups were then used in the second step as an anchor for grafting 2 -hydroxyethylmethacrylate at room temperature. Finally, the materials were prepared by UV-curing of the modified linseed oil and then characterized. The obtained materials are flexible, hydrophobic and not biodegradable, and may have potential applications in flexible coatings...|$|E
30|$|The {{methanolic}} extracts {{of paint}} samples of different historical ages (5, 26 and 373 [*]year old), analysed by GC-MS, revealed that younger paint film contained more {{monounsaturated fatty acid}} and less diacids compared to older paints. This means that the oxidation process continues in paints over hundreds of years. The unsaturated fatty acids are oxidised leading to the higher amount of diacids in older paints. Analysis of 5 -year old <b>stand</b> <b>oil</b> film identified short chain fatty acids (C 7 -C 10), diacids (C 7 -C 11), saturated long chain fatty acids (C 16 -C 18, C 20 -C 22), a cyclic C 18 fatty acid and some unsaturated and/or oxidised C 18 fatty acids, in the extracts. In addition, the analysis detected monounsaturated C 18 fatty acids, but no doubly and triply unsaturated fatty acids, although all acids had been initially present in high concentrations in the oil (van den Berg et al. 2002).|$|E
30|$|The {{amount of}} Pinaceae resin {{detected}} in the samples was found to {{vary according to the}} color: white and light-colored paint samples contained less resin than the dark colors (see Fig.  2). In {{the first decades of the}} twentieth century, high gloss enamel paints reportedly comprised drying oils mixed with a semi-fossil resin such as Congo copal and/or a soft resin such as colophony (pine rosin) and good quality opaque pigments; though colophony was regarded as a poor and unstable paint ingredient, it was extensively used in enamel paint manufacture (Mattiello, 228) in mixtures with drying oils and lime or zinc white or glycerol [40]. Because of the perceived tendency of resins to discolor, technical manuals instructed commercial painters to make white and light-colored house paints using raw linseed oil and/or <b>stand</b> <b>oil</b> with very small quantities of resins, if any, whereas the addition of resins in large quantities was strongly recommended for darker colored enamel paints. (Mattiello, 199 – 206) This is in agreement with the findings on the Ripolin paints tested.|$|E
30|$|There {{are four}} {{varieties}} of linseed oil {{sold in the}} market, including raw, boiled, stand and refined linseed oils. Raw linseed oil refers to pure oil with no additional treatment and with no additives, while boiled linseed oil is produced by adding a mixture of hydrocarbon solvents and metallic dryers to speed its drying time. Boiled oil is a well known trade name, even though the process does not involve boiling of raw <b>oil,</b> whereas the <b>stand</b> linseed <b>oil</b> is processed by heating the oil to about 300 °C, over {{a few days in}} the absence of oxygen. During this process, polymerisation reaction occurs, increasing the oil’s viscosity. It means that <b>stand</b> or polymerised <b>oil</b> has been boiled to make it unreactive and more viscous. The production of refined linseed oil involves the alkali treatment following the pressing process, improving the colour of this oil (paler and clearer). It is utilised as a medium to increase gloss and transparency of paint colours.|$|R

30|$|The {{presence}} of drying oil was indicated in particular by {{high levels of}} dicarboxylic acids. These are relatively stable end-products formed upon oxidation and scission of unsaturated fatty acids and are encountered in relatively high amounts in aged oil paint systems. It is thought that {{the ratio of the}} diacids suberic acid (Su, C 8) to azelaic acid (Az, C 9) gives an indication whether the oil has been prepolymerized by heat treatment [34, 50], since isomerization of the original double bond systems during heating leads to the formation of elevated amounts of diacids other than azelaic acid. Su/Az ratios of 0.4 – 0.5 have been proposed as an indication of heat-processing of the drying oils, although the value will vary according to the exact nature and extent of prepolymerization and other factors. Bodied oils such as <b>stand</b> <b>oil</b> have higher viscosity and were used in oil enamel paints to improve application and performance characteristics [9, 36]. In the dried paint samples from cans examined, the generally high Su/Az ratios of 0.36 – 0.59 suggest that the oil medium has undergone heat-bodying. In comparison to the dried paint samples, the liquid samples analysed did not exhibit detectable levels of diacids and correspondingly higher levels of monounsaturated (oleic) and polyunsaturated acids (linoleic, linolenic and isomers) were found; this is consistent with bulk paint that has been aged in a closed container and not exposed to oxidation.|$|E
40|$|The {{painting}} {{techniques used}} in seven icons (15 th – 17 th cent.) of the Cretan School of iconography were investigated in detail. Microsamples (<< 1 mg) were {{extracted from the}} artworks, which are linked to some prominent representatives of the Cretan School. The {{cross section of the}} microsamples were observed by Optical Microscopy (OM) in the Vis and in the UV light to reveal (i) the existing stratigraphies and (ii) any later interventions that were performed on top of the original colouring layers. Micro-Fourier Transform Infra Red (μFTIR) and μRAMAN spectroscopies were employed primarily for the identification of the inorganic pigments and for the speculation of the origins of the organic materials. The identification of the latter (dyestuffs, binding media and varnishes) was achieved by High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to a Photodiode Array Detector (HPLC-PDA) and Gas Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The results revealed the rich variety of the materials and the sophisticated painting techniques applied by the painters of the Cretan School. Organic dyes, such as kermes, cochineal, madder, soluble redwood and indigoid dyes were used as exclusive colouring matters (or glazes) or in mixtures with inorganic pigments, such as lead white and carbon black. The use of gelatine in the gesso ground was first observed by OM and then confirmed by amino acid quantitative measurements performed by GC-MS. The latter showed that in some icons egg yolk was used as binding medium for the painting layers. Other organic materials which were found in the samples are linseed <b>stand</b> <b>oil,</b> walnut oil, wax, turpentine and synthetic resins...|$|E

For this investigation paint samples were taken from films which had been stored at ambient temperature {{in a variety of}} light conditions (dark storage and ambient indoor light) for approximately 6  years. Additional liquid and dried paint samples were taken directly from paint cans for analysis: when well-sealed, some cans have preserved their content in the liquid phase for almost a century. The examined samples cover a broad range of colors and dates of manufacture. 20 Ripolin paint sample cards (“brochures”, each containing 20 – 86 swatches of paint), which represent the entire color range produced by the company in France and roughly cover the period 1897 – 1950, have been gathered and analysed as reported in an earlier study [19]; several examples are discussed here for comparison with the samples from cans. In total, 31 samples of historic reference paints were analyzed for this study. The paint sample from Kandinsky’s Leichtes 1930 (sample # 1, light blue paint from drip at edge), was provided by the MNAM, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris [32], and the sample from Picasso’s Pêcheur assis à la casquette, 1946 (sample # 5 from the back: drip of gray/white under “Antibes” in the artist’s writing) by the Musée Picasso, Antibes [7, 39].
