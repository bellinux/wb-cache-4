5|$|Howell Road {{was never}} given access from Route 33 {{eastbound}} {{and thus the}} ramp <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> barricaded off, slowly decaying.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{published}} observation {{during the}} 1997 solar eclipse by Wang et al. suggested a possible gravitational shielding effect, which generated debate. Later in 2002, Yang and Wang published detailed data analysis, which {{suggested that the}} phenomenon <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> unexplained.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{pandemic}} occurred in 2009, {{but none of}} the last three has caused anything near the devastation seen in 1918. Exactly why the strain of influenza that emerged in 1918 was so devastating is a question that <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> unanswered.|$|E
50|$|Although Telmex is now {{a private}} company, it <b>stills</b> <b>remains</b> as a quasi-monopoly. There are other {{telephone}} companies in Mexico, but they have failed to be fierce competitors for Telmex. Among these companies are: Alestra (formerly AT&T), Axtel, Maxcom, Megacable, Totalplay and Televisa-owned subsidiaries (Izzi/Cablemás).|$|R

5|$|While Limp Bizkit's {{popularity}} has {{declined in the}} USA since the mid-2000s, it has been noted in the media that the band <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> highly popular in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Another change {{inspired}} by the move was a return for the Football Echo man. The cartoon character had for years indicated the match results of Sunderland with a smile, a frown or a tear, while adorning the outside wall of the Bridge Street building. After several years in storage, he was returned {{to the wall of}} the new Echo building in 1976, where he <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> today.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{researchers}} have identified 119 documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants from historical records. The exact number <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> unclear because many Hawaiians enlisted and served under Anglicized names, and {{little is known}} about them {{due to the lack of}} detailed records.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Malaria <b>stills</b> <b>remains</b> one of {{the leading}} causes of death in sub-Saharan Africa, with P. falciparum being the most virulent strain of Plasmodium. Due to the {{emergence}} of drug resistance, new antimalarial agents are needed to circumvent this. Similarly, in the treatment of cancer, there is an urgent need for the design and development of new antineoplastic agents. This work describes the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of chromone-aminoquinoline hybrids as potentially new chemotherapeutic agents...|$|R
5|$|Costing between $1 and $1.7billion {{to design}} and build (and another billion dollars per year to operate over the five-year life of the operation) and {{possessing}} and controlling {{some of the most}} sophisticated technology in the Southeast Asia theater, Igloo White <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> in question as to its effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Do I wish I {{had never}} endured post-partum depression? Absolutely. But {{to deny the}} {{experience}} is to deny who I am. I still mourn the loss of what could have been, but I also feel deep gratitude for those who stood by me, for the lesson that we must never be afraid to ask for help, and for the feeling of summer that <b>still</b> <b>remains.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hugh was {{not well}} known as a scholar. He did, however, serve as a patron to Roger of Hoveden, the medieval chronicler who started writing about 1169. He also {{commissioned}} two large Bibles, one of which <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> at Durham and is considered a masterpiece of book creation. This is Durham Cathedral Library Manuscript A. II. 1.|$|E

5|$|Like other London termini, steam trains were {{phased out}} of Victoria by the 1960s, to be {{replaced}} by suburban electric and Diesel Multiple Unit services. Despite the end of international services following the opening of the Channel Tunnel, Victoria <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> an important London station, and its underground facilities in particular suffer from overcrowding. The Gatwick Express service provides easy access between Central London and Gatwick Airport for international travellers.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 2011, {{the source}} {{code of the}} Doom 3 engine was {{released}} under the GPL, but the game's artwork content <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> under the EULA. A later source code drop also included the changes made for the BFG Edition, allowing the re-release to potentially be ported to other previously unsupported platforms such as Linux and OS X, and such a port was eventually released.|$|E
5|$|Perl 5.8 {{was first}} {{released}} on July 18, 2002, and had nearly yearly updates since then. Perl 5.8 improved Unicode support, {{added a new}} I/O implementation, added a new thread implementation, improved numeric accuracy, and added several new modules. As of 2013 this version <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> the most popular version of Perl and is used by Red Hat 5, Suse 10, Solaris 10, HP-UX 11.31 and AIX 5.|$|E

5|$|Post World War II, the D-1 saw {{combat in}} {{numerous}} conflicts during the mid- to late 20th century. The long operational history of D-1 howitzers in national armies of numerous countries is {{a testimony to}} its qualities; the gun <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> in service {{in a number of}} post-Soviet states and some other countries. The D-1 is widely considered a valuable element of Soviet artillery.|$|E
5|$|Słowacki's {{tombstone}} at Montmartre {{was designed}} by his friend and executor of his last will, painter Charles Pétiniaud-Dubos; it did not weather {{the passage of time}} well however, and in 1851 a new, similar tombstone was put in place, this one designed by Polish sculptor Władysław Oleszczyński. In 1927 Słowacki's remains were moved to Wawel Cathedral in Poland, but an empty grave <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> at Montmartre.|$|E
5|$|The after-battle monster {{recruitment}} {{has been}} removed. In the original 1995 Super Famicon version of Dragon Quest VI, {{certain types of}} monsters can be randomly recruited if they are defeated with a Monster Master in the party. In the 2010 DS remake, this system has been removed, instead, there are certain Slimes that will join you once you accomplish a specific task. Lizzie <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> recruitable.|$|E

50|$|Anciently {{the island}} {{was used as a}} burial place, and there are <b>still</b> the <b>remains</b> of a chapel in the south east, commemorated in the name Tràigh an Teampaill (Beach of the Temple).|$|R
5|$|The infrageneric {{phylogeny}} of Narcissus <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> relatively unsettled, {{the taxonomy}} having proved complex {{and difficult to}} resolve, due to {{the diversity of the}} wild species, the ease with which natural hybridization occurs, and extensive cultivation and breeding accompanied by escape and naturalisation. Consequently, the number of accepted species has varied widely.|$|E
5|$|The infrageneric {{phylogeny}} of Narcissus <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> relatively unsettled. The taxonomy {{has proved}} very complex {{and difficult to}} resolve, particularly for the Pseudonarcissus group. This {{is due to a}} number of factors, including the diversity of the wild species, the ease with which natural hybridisation occurs, and extensive cultivation and breeding accompanied by escape and naturalisation.|$|E
5|$|The sea <b>still</b> <b>remains</b> a {{venue for}} {{recreational}} boating and large cruise ships. It is also a route for refugees and economic migrants, some traveling in small unseaworthy craft and others smuggled into shipping vessels.
