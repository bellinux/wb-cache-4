The most prominent part of the castle is the Great Gatehouse, a massive three-storey fortification, considered by historians Alastair Oswald and Jeremy Ashbee to be [...] "one of the most imposing structures in any English castle". Multiple rectangular towers protect the walls, including the Lilburn Tower, which looks out towards Bamburgh Castle, and the Egyncleugh Tower, positioned above Queen Margaret's Cove. Three internal complexes of buildings, now ruined, supported the earl's household, the castle constable's household and the running of the surrounding estates. A harbour was built to the south-east of the castle, of which only a <b>stone</b> <b>quay</b> survives.|$|E

50|$|The area of Portland Bill {{had been}} quarried from the 19th-century or earlier, and {{continued}} {{until the early}} 20th-century. During its commercial years, <b>stone</b> shipping <b>quays</b> were created to transport the stone off the island. The <b>stone</b> shipping <b>quay</b> at Red Crane was Portland Bill's prime quay.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, {{the town of}} Erskine was a hamlet. During this time, <b>stone</b> <b>quays</b> were {{constructed}} to support the Erskine Ferry to Old Kilpatrick and Dunbartonshire. This replaced the river ford which had been in place since medieval times. In light of increased industry and infrastructure in the surrounding area, it gradually became a village in the following century. The small church community grew to having 3,000 residents in 1961, when Renfrewshire County Council unveiled its [...] "New Community" [...] plan for the town's development which involved the Scottish Special Housing Association.|$|R
50|$|In 1348 {{the port}} was {{formally}} recognised in an Act of Parliament, covering 80 mi of the Somerset coast line, from the Devon border {{to the mouth}} of the River Axe. This allowed locally collected taxes via the established Customs House to be invested back into port development, with substantial <b>stone</b> <b>quays</b> built from 1424 onwards, {{on both sides of the}} river and located both up and downstream of the Town Bridge. Facilities included a dry dock and launching slips, meaning that during its entire operation the port has also built some 167 ships; the last one being the Irene launched in 1907.|$|R
60|$|Gascony {{has been}} calling {{to me of}} late. I see the blue Garonne winding among the {{vineyards}} and the bluer ocean toward which its waters sweep.

60|$|Day {{had just}} broken, {{and he found}} to his {{surprise}} that the voyage was over, and the schooner in a small harbour, lying alongside a <b>stone</b> <b>quay.</b> A few unloaded trucks stood on a railway line which ran from the harbour to the town clustered behind it, {{but there was no}} sign of work or life; the good people of the place evidently being comfortably in their beds, and in no hurry to quit them.|$|E
60|$|On {{they rode}} accordingly, {{until they came}} to the root of the <b>stone</b> <b>quay</b> or pier, when a sound behind them caused them to look back. Then they saw a sight that sent the blood to their hearts, for there behind them, leaping down one by one on to that narrow footway, were men armed with naked swords, six or eight of them, all of whom, they noted, had strips of linen pierced with eyelet holes tied beneath their helms or leather caps, so as to conceal their faces.|$|E
50|$|Falasarna or Phalasarna (Φαλάσαρνα) is {{an ancient}} Greek harbor town on the {{northwest}} coast of Crete. The currently visible remains of the city were built around 333 BC, and include several imposing sandstone towers and bastions, with hundreds of meters of fortification walls protecting the town, and a closed harbor, meaning it is protected on all sides by city walls. The harbor is ringed by <b>stone</b> <b>quays</b> with mooring <b>stones,</b> and connected to the sea through two artificial channels. Notable finds in the harbor area include public roads, wells, warehouses, an altar, and baths. Most of these structures were revealed by excavations that began in 1986.|$|R

[...] The ship was a mile and more from the land before he {{lost sight of the}} figures of the straight slim girl and her old companion, who stood watching and waving to him {{from the end of the}} grey <b>stone</b> <b>quay.</b> It was with a sinking heart and a vague feeling of impending disaster that he saw them at last as minute specks in the distance, walking townward and disappearing amid the crowd who lined the beach.|$|E
60|$|The {{boat was}} pushed off and very soon {{they reached the}} <b>stone</b> <b>quay</b> that bordered the harbour of the Castle, about which a little village of {{retainers}} had grown up. Seeing the boat arrive, {{some of these people}} sauntered out of the cottages, and then, thinking that a visitor had come, under the guidance of Miss Beatrice, to look at the antiquities of the Castle, which was the show place of the neighbourhood, sauntered back again. Then the pair began the zigzag ascent of the rock mountain, till at last they stood beneath the mighty mass of building, which, although it was hoary with antiquity, was by no means lacking in the comforts of modern civilization, the water, for instance, being brought in pipes laid beneath the sea from a mountain top two miles away on the mainland.|$|E
60|$|At last, {{our knees}} cramped and our feet soaked, {{we saw the}} lights of the French port dancing across the veil of rain, like thistledowns of fire, and {{presently}} we were at rest at a <b>stone</b> <b>quay.</b> As I stood waiting on the deck to have my passport vised, I tried to reconstruct the features of this little seaport as I had seen it, many years before, on a bright summer's day when I had motored from Paris on my way to London. The gay line of hotels facing the water was hidden in the darkness. Suddenly I heard my name called, and I was rescued from the group of civilians by a British officer who introduced himself as my host. It was after nine o'clock, and he had been on the lookout for me since half past seven. The effect of his welcome at that time and place was electrical, and I was further immensely cheered by the news he gave me, as we hurried along the street, that two friends of mine were here and quite hungry, having delayed dinner for my arrival. One of them was a young member of Congress who had been making exhaustive studies of the situation in Italy, France and England, and the other one of our best-known writers, both bound for London. We sat around the table until nearly eleven, exchanging impressions and experiences. Then my officer declared {{that it was time to}} go home.|$|E
50|$|Folly Pier is a disused <b>stone</b> {{shipping}} <b>quay,</b> {{located on}} the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England; part of the Jurassic Coast.

6000|$|... 123. As, however, I {{have told}} you what most {{definitely}} to avoid, I may, perhaps, help you a little by saying what to seek. In general, all banks are beautiful things, and will reward work better than large landscapes. If {{you live in a}} lowland country, you must look for places where the ground is broken to the river's edges, with decayed posts, or roots of trees; or, if by great good luck there should be such things within your reach, for remnants of <b>stone</b> <b>quays</b> or steps, mossy mill-dams, etc. Nearly every other mile of road in chalk country will present beautiful bits of broken bank at its sides; better in form and color than high chalk cliffs. In woods, one or two trunks, with the flowery ground below, are at once the richest and easiest kind of study: a not very thick trunk, say nine inches or a foot in diameter, with ivy running up it sparingly, is an easy, and always a rewarding subject.|$|R
50|$|Initially the barges moored in {{the early}} canals would come {{to rest on the}} muddy bottom making cargo {{handling}} nearly impossible. So at certain places attempts were made to build wooden jetties and <b>stone</b> fortified <b>quays</b> to replace the sloping embankments of the canals such that barges could be moored alongside and be discharged and loaded even if the canal was empty of river water.|$|R
50|$|The <b>stone</b> <b>quay</b> was not {{completed}} until 1854 by Nils Ericson. Today 'Skeppsbron' {{refers to the}} road passing over the quay, while the harbour area outside of it is called Skeppsbrokajen.|$|E

50|$|Close to Porto Alegre downtown, Praia de Belas {{was named}} after the farmer Antônio Rodrigues de Belas, who {{constructed}} a road for the slave trade in 1839, today known as Praia de Belas avenue. The number of dwellers begun to grow when a <b>stone</b> <b>quay</b> was built in 1870, and thus the political authorities decided to expand its area. In 1960, a big portion of Guaíba Lake was covered with landfill and enabled the planned urbanization process. Since then it has been home to innumberable government and public buildings, such as courthouses: the Administrative Centre of Rio Grande do Sul is located here, {{as well as many}} courthouses. Moreover, there are two parks in Praia Belas: the Marinha do Brasil Park and Maurício Sirotski Sobrinho Park.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the village}} was {{abandoned}} in the early 20th century it became overgrown and large cut masonry <b>stones</b> from the <b>quay</b> were stolen.

5000|$|The {{size of the}} Old Dock {{became a}} {{drawback}} for increasingly large ships and so in 1874 a floating New Dock was opened to the South. This had several advantages over the Old Dock: its entrance was now through a tidal basin and a large lock. This gave a constant water level within the dock, matching that of the canal, and so no locks were needed between dock and canal, encouraging traffic. The lock was 320ft long and 57ft wide. For ships longer than this, the basin itself {{could also be used}} as a lock. A graving dock was provided parallel to the lock. This constant level encouraged the building of wharves and warehouses. With the new rail connections available to Bristol, Sharpness also developed as a port in its own right. At first the only <b>stone</b> <b>quay</b> was on the landward side of the dock, but after a railway swing bridge was built across the dock, the island area between the two docks also developed as a quayside.|$|E
5000|$|Sir Hugh Montgomery built a large <b>stone</b> <b>quay</b> to {{accommodate}} vessels ferrying between Scotland and Ireland from 1616 onwards. Viscount Montgomery's harbour (1626; improved 1640), superseding what had hitherto been probably {{only a small}} jetty, was built and maintained {{as a result of}} the Royal Warrant of 1616 which limited travel between the Ards and the Rhins of Galloway to this port, and that at Portpatrick also owned by Montgomery. It was described by Harris in 1744 as 'a curving quay about 400 ft long and 22 ft wide built of uncemented stones'. It ran from the shore at the north end of the Parade in a broad arc, bent against the open sea, towards the southern end of the present north pier. Much patched and decrepit, the quay was virtually rebuilt, though along the original line, between 1775 and 1785 by the landlord, Daniel Delacherois, probably with the help of John Smeaton, a civil engineer who had apparently made earlier more elaborate plans for extending the harbour, and had just rebuilt Portpatrick harbour.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} a port at Wells for over 600 years. The harbour is {{protected}} by salt marshes behind a sand bar. Because it is a natural safe haven from the unpredictable North Sea weather the Port of Wells was one of England's major harbours in Tudor times and a thriving, centre for shipping and maritime industry in the 18th and 19th centuries. Its greatest period of prosperity was probably from 1830 to 1860. The <b>stone</b> <b>quay</b> side was constructed in 1845 following an Act of Parliament the previous year. The coming of the railway in 1857 {{marked the beginning of}} decline though there was a resurgence from 1960 to 1989 when coasters bringing fertilizer and animal feed came in some numbers. The Granary with its distinctive gantry was built around 1904; it has now been turned into apartments. The gantry allowed grain to be transferred between the building and ships without disrupting road traffic. The railway closed in 1964 and in 1976, the Wells Harbour Railway was constructed to link the town with the beach and Pinewoods Holiday Park. It replaced a withdrawn bus service.|$|E
2500|$|From the 1860s Fleetwood {{expanded}} its port activities. Steamers began pleasure and commercial {{services to the}} Isle of Man, Ardrossan and Belfast. [...] of <b>stone</b> <b>quays</b> were built along the river front, and the railway line was extended to the steamer pier opposite Queen's Terrace, where the imposing new railway station was built in 1883. The port was still mainly a cargo terminal at this time, but the fishing industry began to grow as vessels expanded their catchment area from the Irish Sea fishing grounds first fished in the 1840s, to the haddock grounds of the North Atlantic Ocean. At this time, all the fishing vessels out of Fleetwood were sail-powered fishing smacks, few being over 40 tons deadweight. The Fleetwood Docks Act of 1864 enabled {{the construction of a}} dock and embankment for both fishing and general cargo. Work on what was to become Wyre Dock began in 1869 but was suspended for financial reasons. A second Act in 1871 gave construction authority to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, under chief engineers Sir John Hawkshaw and Harrison Hayter. Construction itself, by John Aird & Sons, was completed in 1877. Heavy industry came to the area in the late 1880s with the construction of a salt-processing works on the southeastern edge of the town by the Fleetwood Salt Co. Ltd, using salt mined in Preesall, across the river.|$|R
50|$|King's Pier is a 17th-century <b>stone</b> {{shipping}} <b>quay,</b> {{located on}} the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England; part of the Jurassic Coast. It is found at the boundary point of the land owned by Portland Port Ltd, {{on the east side}} of the island within the area of East Weares. To the north of the pier is Balaclava Bay, whilst further south along the coastline are the remains of Folly Pier and Folly Pier Waterworks, East Weare Rifle Range, the two Salt Pans, Little Beach and Durdle Pier respectively. When active, King's Pier was one of the most important stone shipping pier sites.|$|R
50|$|Notably, {{the last}} {{recorded}} {{use of a}} siege tower, known as a sow, in Britain or Ireland, was at the siege of the stone fort in Sligo during this war.
