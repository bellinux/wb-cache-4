40|$|Results are {{reported}} of Fe(++) crystal field spectral measurements for olivines and pyroxenes up to 400 C. The results are correlated with crystal structure data at elevated temperatures, and {{the validity of}} remote-sensed identifications of minerals on hot surfaces of the moon and Mercury is assessed. Two techniques were used to obtain <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> minerals at elevated temperatures using a spectrophotometer. One employed a diamond cell assembly or a specially designed sample holder to measure polarized absorption <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> heated single crystals. For the other technique, a sample holder was designed to attach to a diffuse reflectance accessory to produce reflectance <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> heated powdered samples. Polarized absorption <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> forsterite at 20 - 400 C are shown in a graph.

5|$|In 1894, American {{astronomer}} William W.

Previous detections of water in the atmosphere of Mars were explained by unfavorable conditions, and Campbell determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth's atmosphere. Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there was water in the atmosphere, he did not believe the caps were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected. At the time, Campbell's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community, but they were confirmed by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1925.|$|E

40|$|Infrared {{reflectance}} <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> {{carefully selected}} Mars soil analog material have been measured under low atmospheric pressures and tempertures. Chemically altered montmorillonites containing ferrihydrite and hydrated ferric sulfate complexes are examinated, aswel as synthetic ferrihydrite and a palagonitic soil from Haleakala, Maui. Reflectance <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> these analog materials exhibit subtle visible to near-infrared features, which {{are indicative of}} nanophase ferric oxides or oxyhydroxides and are similar to features observed in the <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> the bright regions of Mars. Infrared reflectance <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> these analgs include hydration features due to structural OH, bound H 2 O and adsorbed H 2 O. The spectral character of these hydration features is highly dependent on the sample environment and {{on the nature of}} the H 2 O/OH in the analogs. The behavior of the hydration featuresnear 1. 9 muem, 2. 2 muem, 2. 7 muem, 3 muem, and 6 muem are reported in spectra measured under a Marslike atmospheric environment. In <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> these analogs measured under dry Earth atmospheric conditions the 1. 9 -muem band depth is 8 - 17 %; this band ismuch stronger under moist conditions. Under Marslike atmospheric conditions the 1. 9 -muem feature is broad and barely disverible (1 - 3 % band depth) in <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> the ferrihydrite and palagonitic soil samples.
