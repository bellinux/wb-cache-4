50|$|Still, the {{phylogeny}} {{and evolution}} of the long-tailed pheasants can be considered resolved to satisfaction by now. It was long accepted that the three southeastern species—which all have bright white wing-bands of a type not found in any close relative and differ little except in the amount and concentration of eumelanins in their plumage—form a clade. However, the two others are not as closely {{related to each other}} as was previously thought, representing two lineages that diverged independently from the main lineage instead of being sister species. These—Reeves's <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> reevesii) and the copper <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> soemmerringii)—are sometimes placed in monotypic genera, but as noted above though this may eventually turn out to be warranted it is not well supported by the available evidence.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{the white}} wing-band was already present by that time; as the copper {{pheasant}} has a highly apomorphic coloration with reduced sexual dimorphism, {{it may well}} have lost such a trait after it settled Japan. But it might also have evolved only after the copper pheasant ancestors had split {{from those of the}} species displaying the wing-band today. However that may be, the minor plumage differences of the wing-banded species suggest that their last common ancestor looked almost identical to the living Mrs. Hume's <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> humiae). At some point during the Pliocene [...] - [...] probably around 2.8 mya during the Piacenzian [...] - [...] the ancestors of the Mikado <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> mikado) settled Taiwan, apparently during the period when that island separated from the mainland and alternated between being a peninsula and an island for some time. They were finally isolated no later than the Late Pliocene; the species is melanistic, suggesting a small founder population. The adjacent mainland population split into the subtropical and partially leucistic Elliot's <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> ellioti) and the tropical Mrs. Hume's pheasant only in the Middle Pleistocene, around half a million years ago. This divergence was probably in some way connected to climate changes at the Günz-Mindel interglacial to Mindel boundary, when mountains in the region became dry and at times icebound. The Nanling Mountains region marks the present-day boundary between these sister species and is not inhabited by either.|$|R

40|$|Cytochrome P 450 -Dependent Monooxygenase Activities and Their Inducibility by Classic P 450 Inducers in the Liver, Kidney, and Nasal Mucosa of Male Adult Ring-Necked Pheasants. Giorgi M., Marini S., Longo V., Mazzaccaro A., Amato G., and Gervasi P. G. (2000). Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 167, 237 – 245. In this study, several P 450 -dependent monoxygenase {{activities}} in the liver, kidney, and nasal mucosa of ring-necked pheasants were examined. In addition, the presence and inducibility of P 450 isoenzymes in the hepatic and renal tissues of pheasants were examined by using typical substrates and inducers of P 450 s along with polyclonal antibodies raised against mammalian isoforms. Anti-rat P 450 1 A 1 recognized in microsomes of both pheasant liver and kidney a protein that was markedly induced by b-naphthoflavone and accompanied by an increase of various monooxygenases, in particular, methoxyresorufin-O-demethylase (MROD) activity. Anti-rat P 450 2 E 1 revealed in microsomes of the pheasant liver but not in kidney an immunoreactive protein that was slightly induced by acetone but not accompanied by an increase of para-nitrophenol hydroxylase activity. On the other hand, acetone treatment caused an induction of other hepatic monoxygenases including MROD, erythromycin N-demethylase, and 6 b-testosterone hydroxylase. These two latter activities, known to be markers for 3 A isoenzymes in rodents, were also enhanced in pheasant liver by phenobarbital but not by dexamethasone. The treatment with these two inducers also lacked to point out hepatic and renal proteins immunorelated to P 450 3 A or 2 B subfamily, suggesting that these isoforms may be not expressed in pheasant. On the other hand, anti-rat P 450 2 C 11 recognized two immunorelated proteins in the liver of both control and treated pheasants. The treatment with clofibrate, a mammalian inducer of 4 A subfamily, induced both in liver and kidney of pheasant: i) a protein that cross-reacted with anti rat P 450 4 A 1 and ii) the (v) and (v 21) lauric acid hydroxylase activities, known to be associated in mammals to this P 450 subfamily. In the nasal mucosa of pheasant, a protein immunorelated to P 450 2 A and some monooxygenase activities (i. e., 7 -ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase) linked, in mammals, to this isoform have been found; by contrast a protein immunoreactive with anti P 450 2 G 1 was not found. In conclusion, the immunochemical properties and monooxygenase activities of constitutive and inducible P 450 <b>s</b> in <b>pheasants</b> were different not only from those of mammals but also from those of chickens. The findings of the present work also suggest that the P 450 induction profiles might provide a potential biomarker of pheasant exposure to chemicals or environmental pollutants in the wild-field or in the stock-farm...|$|R
40|$|Many {{species of}} {{wildlife}} use roadside vegetation as habitat. The ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) utilizes roadsides {{for all types}} of cover. Because pheasants are nonmigratory and generally live their entire lives within a 1 - to 2 -mile radius, pheasants are excellent indicator species to predict both quantity and quality of roadside wildlife habitat. Pheasants were introduced to Utah in the late 18002 ̆ 7 s. Populations climbed until pheasant habitat occupied 2 - 4 percent of the total land area in Utah. Populations began to decrease in the 19502 ̆ 7 <b>s.</b> Since 1962, <b>pheasant</b> populations in Cache County, Utah have dropped 2. 71 percent annually. Experts believe the decline in pheasants is directly related to decreased habitat. They attribute the decrease to land use changes. Cache County roadsides currently support 3, 643 acres of wildlife habitat and have the potential to support over 15, 000 acres. To evaluate roadside habitat in Cache County, a roadside vegetation inventory was conducted. This was done by conducting a windshield survey of Cache County roadsides in agricultural areas. Next, vegetation density was measured along roadside transects using a Daubenmire frame and vertical profile board. The results showed Cache County roadsides did not support quality wildlife habitat. The exception was wetlands that contained significant stands of cattail. The evaluation found current maintenance practices of mowing and spraying roadside vegetation has degraded the plant communities and created dense monocultures of a few grass species. A questionnaire was completed by county weed supervisors throughout the state of Utah as well as Utah Department of Transportation personnel and other people associated with the managment of roadside vegetation. The questionnaire provided information about current roadside maintenance practices and attitudes. As a result of the roadside vegetation data and the questionnaire, the study determined that healthier roadside plant communities are possible if current maintenance practices and standards are modified. These modifications should include 1) spot spraying herbicide to eradicate weed species, 2) mowing only 10...|$|R
