40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that bearing <b>sons</b> increases long-term mortality in women, because <b>sons</b> may be more physiologically demanding to produce than daughters. In this historical cohort study in rural Bangladesh, no association between the number of <b>sons</b> born and mortality was seen in women in the unadjusted analyses. However, a significant reduction in mortality with the number of surviving <b>sons</b> was seen. In addition, after adjusting for the number of surviving <b>sons,</b> there was evidence of increasing mortality with the number of <b>sons</b> born, in women. In men, mortality also depended strongly on the number of surviving <b>sons,</b> but not on the number born. These data provide support for negative long-term costs of bearing <b>sons</b> in mothers in rural Bangladesh, and suggest that there are context-specific factors that mask the true effects of <b>sons</b> in some populations. © 2005 The Royal Society...|$|R
