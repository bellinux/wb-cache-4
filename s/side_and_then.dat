5|$|Aisles {{were added}} to the nave in the 14th century, first on the north <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> on the south, {{doubling}} the seating capacity. More windows were also installed in the nave. A century later, a timber porch was built on the north side, the chancel arch was widened and a rood screen was installed, a standard feature of churches in the medieval era, as were wall decorations and paintings. Ecclesiastical feeling moved in favour of austere, whitewashed walls, screens and pillars by the 17th century, and Parliament decreed these changes in the 1640s. The vicar of Ifield, Reverend Robert Goddin, was a strict Protestant who was strongly opposed to Catholic-style worship, ceremony and church decoration, and he enforced the new style rigorously. The rood screen and all internal decoration were removed at this time.|$|E
5|$|By July 1929 {{the last}} of the {{superstructure}} had been cleared, and Bremse was turned upside down using techniques developed on salvaging some of the destroyers. Compressors were then used to pump air into the hull and bring her to the surface, while she was supported by 9-inch wires attached to two floating docks anchored on her port shoreward side. The salvage teams had almost raised her when she suddenly toppled onto her <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> heeled over gradually during the night, settling onto the rocks inshore.|$|E
5|$|In {{commemoration}} of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine {{was built by}} The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch. The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> flipped onto a plate.|$|E

5|$|Having {{spent the}} winter {{alone on the}} ocean, {{it is unclear whether}} the Atlantic puffin meets its {{previous}} partner offshore or whether they encounter each other when they return to their nest of the previous year. On land, they soon set about improving and clearing out the burrow. Often, one stands outside the entrance while the other excavates, kicking out quantities of soil and grit that showers the partner standing outside. Some birds collect stems and fragments of dry grasses as nesting materials but others do not bother. Sometimes a beakful of materials is taken underground, only to be brought out again and discarded. Apart from nest-building, the other way in which the birds restore their bond is by billing. This is a practice in which the pair approach each other, each wagging its head from side to <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> rattle their beaks together. This seems to be an important element of their courtship behaviour because it happens repeatedly, and the birds continue to bill, to a lesser extent, throughout the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{starts in}} 1476 as Francisco leads Portuguese troops under Prince Juan {{to victory in}} the Battle of Toro by destroying Aragonese military camps and capturing Cardinal Mendoza and the Duke of Alba. He then launches raids on supporters of Queen Isabella. In the end, the battle is indecisive, but King Afonso receives assurances from Spain that the African coast and eastern waters are a Portuguese domain. Thirteen years later, in 1489, Francisco serves the now-King Juan, in a mission to consolidate Portuguese control of Tangiers at an island outpost in the Loukkos River led by Afonso de Albuquerque, defending the area from Barbary pirates. He is then appointed Viceroy of Portuguese India by King Manuel, and sets sail for his new post. He plunders the Swahili coast along the way there, razing Mombasa. He then establishes Portuguese India in Cannanore and Cochin and confronts the Zamorin of Calicut who intends to undermine Portuguese rule of India, and who has suborned the allegiance of Kolathiri Raja with gold; Francisco then plunders the Malabar coast. He then moves to the Gujarati coast. Afonso de Albuquerque is sent by King Manuel to relieve Francisco of his post and send him to Portugal to face accusations of misconduct in the Indies. Francisco hears of the news of his son's death {{at the hands of}} a Egyptian fleet led by Amir Husain and refuses to return until he avenges his son's death. He converts Afonso de Albuquerque to his <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> takes revenge on his enemies in the Battle of Diu in 1509, including the Egyptian Mamelukes and the Ottomans. This being done, he sets sail for Portugal, being slain by Khoikoi warriors in modern-day South Africa while gathering water.|$|E
25|$|P. californicus {{is active}} from mid-morning until dusk, {{and can be}} seen in bushes running along {{branches}} or poised near their tips.

25|$|Common law courts usually use an {{adversarial}} system, {{in which}} two sides present their cases to a neutral judge. In contrast, civil law systems usually use an inquisitorial system in which an examining magistrate serves two roles by developing the evidence and arguments for one <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the other during the investigation phase.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tour, {{there was}} one more five-wicket innings for Cowie in the match against Middlesex. That proved to be his last {{significant}} bowling achievement in first-class cricket. He moved in his job in insurance to Wellington on his return from England and he appeared in the 1949-50 New Zealand domestic season in just one match for Auckland against a non-Test-playing Australian <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> retired.|$|E

25|$|The main {{sources of}} water were Free Mosedale Beck (now known as Sticks Gill East), which ran through the upper valley beneath Green <b>Side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> became Swart Beck as it ran more steeply down to the lower valley of Glenridding. Glenridding Beck was the other source, fed by Red Tarn, Brown Cove and Keppelcove Tarn. Over the years a series of {{reservoirs}} were created to regulate {{the flow of water}} in these becks.|$|E
25|$|The falls {{are part}} of the Doña Juana Creek as it runs into Rio Toro Negro at the line that divides the {{municipalities}} of Ciales and Orocovis. The falls are very accessible, as they are viewable from the road as drivers cross the bridge of these falls. The falls fall next to the road on its eastern <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> run under the PR-149 bridge, to feed into Rio Toro Negro located a few yards on the western side of PR-149.|$|E

50|$|BoxedOriginally, boxed frames {{were made}} by welding two {{matching}} C-rails {{together to form a}} rectangular tube.

25|$|Euclid {{often used}} proof by contradiction. Euclidean {{geometry}} also allows {{the method of}} superposition, in which a figure is transferred to another point in space. For example, proposition I.4, side-angle-side congruence of triangles, is proved by moving {{one of the two}} triangles so that one of its sides coincides with the other triangle's equal <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> proving that the other sides coincide as well. Some modern treatments add a sixth postulate, the rigidity of the triangle, which can be used as an alternative to superposition.|$|E
25|$|Female P. californicus and P. apacheanus are {{unusual in}} that they perform an {{acceptance}} dance just before the male touches them. With forelegs high and wide apart and abdomen bent to the side, the female sways before the male, sometimes with a few steps to one <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the other. In other Phidippus species, the female rejects the male by extending the first pair of legs whenever he approaches too closely, and merely fails to ward him off when she is ready to accept him.|$|E
25|$|VeloBind {{is used to}} {{permanently}} rivet pages together using {{a plastic}} strip {{on the front and}} back of the document. Sheets for the document are punched with a line of holes near the bound edge. A series of pins attached to a plastic strip called a Comb feeds through the holes to the other <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> goes through another plastic strip called the receiving strip. The excess portion of the pins is cut off and the plastic heat-sealed to create a relatively flat bind method. VeloBind provides a more permanent bind than comb-binding, but is primarily used for business and legal presentations and small publications.|$|E

Xi'er comes to a river that stops her. She takes off a shoe and leaves it at the river <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> hides in the bush. Mu Renzhi and his men find the shoe and assume that Xi'er has drowned herself in the river, and they report to the landlord as such.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} of Imran's early life, {{including}} his date and place of birth. His first matches at higher levels came for a Vidarbha team in the 1962–63 and 1963–64 editions of the Cooch Behar Trophy, a school-based tournament. His good form for Vidarbha led to his selection first for a Central Zone Schools <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> for an India Schools side that toured Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in April 1964, and included future Test cricketers Surinder Amarnath, Ramnath Parkar, Ashok Gandotra, and Eknath Solkar. Imran scored a century in the team's match against a Jaffna Schools side, an innings of 102 not out batting alongside Ramesh Nagdev, who scored 85 runs.|$|E
