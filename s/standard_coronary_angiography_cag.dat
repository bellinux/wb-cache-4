40|$|Coronary artery disease, and {{especially}} ischemic heart disease, {{is a major}} concern in Western society. To reduce mortality and morbidity early detection and treatment is important. Ideally, early detection should be non-invasive, fast and cheap. <b>Coronary</b> <b>angiography</b> (<b>CAG)</b> is a reliable technique to identify the coronary lumen. The ability of performing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and intra-coronary stent implantation has made CAG an indispensable procedure in the routine clinical setting. CAG, therfore, is seen as the gold standard to which other new modalities have to be compared to. CAG, however, is invasive and therefore carries the risk of morbidity and mortality. It also lacks the ability to visualize the vessel wall and can thus not detect the early stages of coronary artery disease. In the late 1970 s, the first attempts were made to visualize the human coronary arteries non-invasively.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} the "distressed personality" (type-D) in cardiac patients and to explore the relationships between type-D, gender, vital exhaustion and angina pectoris. Methods: A questionnaire was completed by 171 patients scheduled for <b>coronary</b> <b>angiography</b> (<b>CAG)</b> at baseline and again at 6 weeks following implementation of treatment with invasive procedures or medication. Results: Women were more vitally exhausted at baseline {{and more likely to}} be classified as type-D. Type-D patients scored higher on vital exhaustion independent of all other variables. Angina was related to vital exhaustion, but improvement in angina following intervention was not associated with improvement in vital exhaustion scores. Conclusion: Although medical interventions reduced angina, a concomitant decrease in vital exhaustion scores was not found. It is suggested that type-D may explain gender differences on distress. Clinical implications are discussed, including the importance of including personality factors in future research, as they have been shown to have independent prognostic value.
