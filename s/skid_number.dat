40|$|AbstractAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Report System, {{more than}} 25 percent of fatal crashes occur on {{horizontal}} curves. High Friction Surface Treatments are an innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable means of improving roadway safety, which could improve {{the safety of}} this alignment. This research involved {{a comprehensive review of}} crash data to identify the correlation between pavement <b>skid</b> <b>number,</b> roadway curvature degree, crash rate, and crash severity. The dataset showed that greater injury occurred on higher degrees of curvature, and lower skid numbers correlated to a higher percent of wet road crashes. Also, around a <b>skid</b> <b>number</b> of 55, an increase in <b>skid</b> <b>number</b> no longer resulted in decreased crash rates. The goal of this research is to use these correlations to develop Crash Modification Factor that would integrate pavement friction and horizontal curvature, to enhance the accuracy of the current Highway Safety annual performance function...|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} {{model for the}} ratio of skid numbers obtained with the ribbed E 501 test tire to those obtained with the blank E 524 test tire at any speed has been developed using data from 22 pavement test sites in Pennsylvania. The prediction {{is based on the}} Penn State Model for skid resistance-speed behavior. The model was developed as a function of a macrotexture parameter defined by sand-patch mean texture depth (MTD). An application of this model permits the prediction of the blank-tire <b>skid</b> <b>number</b> at any speed from a measured ribbed-tire <b>skid</b> <b>number</b> and a macrotexture measurement. A simplified model for the blank-tire <b>skid</b> <b>number</b> at 64 km/h (40 mph) test speed was also developed. Values calculated from both models show good agreement with each other {{as well as with the}} actual data. Another effort in this study was to relate skid resistance measured with both types of test tires to pavement texture. The results show a strong relationship between skid numbers with both test tires and pavement macrotexture and microtexture. Therefore, if a pavement skid-resistance survey is performed with both the blank E 524 and the ribbed E 501 test tires, the levels of macrotexture and microtexture can readily be estimated. The seasonal and short-term variations in data with the two tires also were compared. It was found that the short-term variations in the blank tire data do not pose at great a problem as those in the ribbed tire data...|$|E

40|$|Frequent {{measurements}} of skid resistance {{were made on}} 20 pavements in common use in Kentucky. Tests were conducted from November 1969 through 1973. Principal analysis involved relating changes in skid resistance to {{day of the year}} and relating skid resistance to temperature at the time of test, to average antecedent temperatures, and to average rainfall. Seasonal variations exhibited an annual sinusoidal cycle. The changes in sand-asphalt and bituminous concrete surfaces under higher volumes of traffic were about 12 <b>skid</b> <b>numbers.</b> The changes in portland cement concrete and bituminous concrete under lower volumes of traffic were about 5 <b>skid</b> <b>numbers.</b> The lowest <b>skid</b> <b>numbers</b> (SN's) occurred in early to mid-August for portland cement concrete and sand-asphalt pavements and in late August to early September for bituminous concrete. Correlations between changes in SN and temperature were best for ambient air temperature averaged over 4 - and 8 -week periods prior to date of test. However, correlations between changes in SN and temperature were not as good as correlations between SN and day of the year. On the other hand, combining traffic volumes in the form of deviations from yearly average daily traffic with temperature yielded correlations with SN's which were as good as correlations between SN's and the day of the year. It was concluded that skid resistance measurements in Kentucky should be conducted between the first of July and the middle of November to be assured of detecting significant differences in SN. However, frequent testing of reference sections is recommended to define more specifically each year the beginning and ending date of the testing season. Burchett and Rizenberg...|$|R
40|$|Objectives of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} standard and experimental surfaces tl 1 roughout Kentucky in terms of skid resistance and effects of traffic, and to provide criteria for judging suitability of these surfaces to satisfy requirements for skid resistance and economics. The effects of tiaffic weie quantified by regiession analysis and scatter of data. Criteria included an estimate of accident risks, effects of speed on skid resistance, and seasonal variations in skid resistance. Pavements on low volume roads (less than 1, 000 vehicles per day) maintained adequate skid Iesistances. Open-giaded fiiction courses, {{with the possible exception of}} sections using phosphate slag aggiegate, maintained adequate skid resistance to meet design requirements. The adequacy of other pavements may be judged from the criteria provided herein. Estimates of accident reduction were made by combining the relationship between <b>skid</b> <b>numbers</b> and accidents with the distribution of <b>skid</b> <b>numbers</b> for each pavement type.

40|$|Pavement {{roughness}} {{has been}} found to {{have an effect on the}} coefficient of friction measured with the Locked-Wheel Skid Tester (LWT) with measured friction decreasing as the long wave roughness of the pavement increases. However, the current pavement friction standardization model adopted by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), to compute the International Friction Index (IFI), does not account for this effect. In other words, it had been previously assumed that the IFI 2 ̆ 7 s speed constant (SP), which defines the gradient of the pavement friction versus speed relationship, is an invariant for any pavement with a given mean profile depth (MPD), regardless of its roughness. This study was conducted to quantify the effect of pavement roughness on the IFI 2 ̆ 7 s speed constant. The first phase of this study consisted of theoretical modeling of the LWT using a two-degree of freedom vibration system. The model parameters were calibrated to match the measured natural frequencies of the LWT. The calibrated model was able to predict the normal load variation during actual LWT tests to a reasonable accuracy. Furthermore, by assuming a previously developed <b>skid</b> <b>number</b> (SN) versus normal load relationship, even the friction profile of the LWT during an actual test was predicted reasonably accurately. Because the <b>skid</b> <b>number</b> (SN) versus normal load relationship had been developed previously using rigorous protocol, a new method that is more practical and convenient was prescribed in this work. This study concluded that higher pavement long-wave roughness decreases the value of the SP compared to a pavement with identical MPD but lower roughness. Finally, the magnitude of the loss of friction was found to be governed by the non-linear <b>skid</b> <b>number</b> versus normal load characteristics of a pavement...|$|E
40|$|Wet pavement-related {{collisions}} {{represent a}} significant traffic safety concern, {{due in part}} to the lack of adequate friction between tire and pavement, known as skid resistance. State agencies employ a <b>skid</b> <b>number</b> (SN) system, based on a standard test procedure in which a locked wheel is towed at 40 mph and the <b>skid</b> <b>number</b> (SN 40) is calculated from the measured resistance. SN 40 is used as a reference value for speeds both greater than and less than 40 mph. For most Departments of Transportation (DOTs) in the nation, excluding California, pavements for which the SN 40 is below 30 are deemed unacceptable and corrective actions are required. The main objectives of this study are (1) to evaluate and analyze skid test results from the test data inventory, and (2) to identify and analyze before-and-after collision data at sites where three experimental types of pavements (Open Graded Asphalt Concrete [OGAC], Groove Pavement [GP], and Rubberized Open Graded Asphalt Concrete [R-OGAC]) have been implemented.

40|$|Wet {{pavement}} skidding due to inadequate {{surface texture}} or friction contributes to 20 % to 35 % of all wet weather crashes. Many {{of the past}} studies of pavement surface texture and friction have deficiency in selecting the model forms or variables and interpreting the models and (or) the findings or have recommended further investigation. These pose a challenge for the highway agencies in selecting the appropriate surface layer and (or) measuring tools. This study was undertaken to re-examine some of the pavement surface texture and skid resistance related issues and aid the highway agencies in this area. Pavement surface texture and skid resistance aspects were carefully examined using the data collected from nine asphalt concrete (AC) surfaces. Pavement surface texture was measured using the sand patch method and a high speed texture laser. Skid resistance was measured using a British Pendulum and a skid trailer. The analysis has reinstated that aggregate quality is the predominant factor for AC surface skid resistance. Both texture depth and ribbed tire skid resistance was shown to increase {{with an increase in}} coarse aggregate (CA) content proving their interdependency. Neither the voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) or air voids (AV) contents showed a meaningful or statistically significant correlation with the surface texture or skid resistance. Fairly good correlations were found among the British Pendulum number (BPN), ribbed tire <b>skid</b> <b>number</b> (SN) and mean texture depth (MTD) rejecting the hypothesis that BPN is a measure of only surface microtexture and ribbed tire <b>skid</b> <b>number</b> is insensitive to surface texture...|$|E

40|$|Airport {{pavements}} need to {{be maintained}} for adequate health condition by implementing cost effective maintenance solutions. Traditionally, maintenance and repair techniques have been developed based on the minimum acceptable Pavement Condition Index (PCI). However, there are pavements which show high PCI but have low Structural Condition Index (SCI); though these pavements are good in terms of functional condition, their structural condition is not good. This may lead to pavement reconstruction {{after a few years}} of service life, instead of minor repair. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} combine a study of functional and structural conditions. Moreover, the Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) determines the best option based on the minimum life cycle cost assuming all alternatives have equal functional benefit. By only performing LCCA, one cannot draw a conclusion about the functional benefit achieved by an alternative. A pavement may reach the end of its life cycle and then require an extensive reconstruction or major repair work which is difficult to include in LCCA. This study focuses on PCI based and PCI-SCI based pavement evaluation of a selected 19 general aviation airports in New Mexico. Deterministic and probabilistic LCCA and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) of major maintenance treatments have been performed based on PCI with or without considering SCI and hence significance of SCI in LCCA of airport pavements has been studied. A new System Dynamic (SD) Model has been developed which predicts PCI as a function of time after various maintenance treatments and determines the functional benefit and life cycle treatment cost of those alternatives. Both linear and nonlinear deterioration rates have been considered in determining benefit. Different BCR design charts have been developed based on the SD study, and, different management goals have been compared using a pavement management tool named MicroPAVER. A good correlation can be drawn between PCI and SCI, but <b>Skid</b> <b>Number</b> does not show any correlation with any other indices for this study where <b>Skid</b> <b>Number</b> (SN) represents the skid resistance of the pavement surface. Developed design charts are helpful to set cutoff PCI and to select the most effective maintenance treatment to obtain maximum BCR. PCI-SCI approach gives a higher BCR than PCI approach only for Carlsbad airport; as it has its SCI value close to its PCI value. Analysis also shows that, among all of the single maintenance treatments, spray patching is the most cost effective and Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) overlay shows the highest functional benefit. The management goal of ‘Reach PCI 80 ’ has shown the highest functional benefit than other strategies and different single maintenance treatments.

The lack of specialization in the pavement domains as {{students and the}} increasing financial requirement of pavement maintenance are hindering new engineers from further improving their knowledge on pavement. The present study aimed to improve the comfort index of national freeways. First, the inspection aspects of national freeways, such as road testing items and methods, are analyzed. Subsequently, the lack of previous literature on this subject prompted the researchers to organize relevant information pertaining to the comfort index and inspection processes of national freeways. The inspection and analysis of national freeways are beneficial for maintaining and enhancing the comfort and quality of national freeways.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a part of}} the findings of a three-year research program to develop a basic mechanistic model to predict the seasonal and short-term variations in skid resistance as a function of environmental and traffic conditions. The model treats the seasonal and short-term variations separately. Data were analyzed from 21 test surfaces in State College, Pennsylvania. For the seasonal trend, an exponential curve was fitted to the <b>skid</b> <b>number</b> data for the asphalt pavements, while a linear relationship best fit the data for portland cement concrete surfaces. The coefficients of the resulting seasonal variation curves were fitted to pavement and traffic parameters to provide predictors for the long term effects. Significant predictors were found to be British Pendulum Numbers (BPN) and average daily traffic (ADT). Other predictors for pavement polishing are suggested in place of BPN to predict the rate of decrease in skid resistance over an annual cycle. After the data for seasonal variations were adjusted, the remaining short-term variations were regressed against rainfall, terperature, and macrotexture parameter. The short-term variations can be predicted by dry spell factor (DSF) and pavement temperature (T_p), but the introduction of the measured percent normalized gradient (PNG) was found to improve the regression. The developed model wes applied for predicting the level of skid resistance {{at the end of the}} year (SN_ 64 F) and for predicting the skid resistance at any day from a measurement taken on a different day.

Information from the Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) Program database was analyzed for this purpose. One of the experiments developed under the LTPP Program, is Specific Pavement Study number 2 (SPS- 2) on the structural design factors of rigid pavements. SPS- 2 planned to build 12 pavement sections in 16 States. The sets of 12 pavement sections included three types of base course, two slab thicknesses and two widths. Slab length and dowel bars were held constant. Two concrete mixtures were designed by each State with local materials for target 14 day flexural strengths of 3800 and 6200 kPa. Most States included supplemental sections, with typical mixtures used by the State. In most cases the component materials remained constant while the proportions varied for the two concrete mixtures. In several States the geological class of the stone was different for the two mixtures. In each State the construction practices, including finishing, texturing and curing were the same for both levels of concrete strength.

40|$|Skid {{resistance}} {{is an important}} parameter for highway designs, construction, management, maintenance and safety. The purpose of this manuscript is to propose the correlation between skid resistance, which is measured as skid resistance trailer, and mean profile depth (MPD) or the macro surface texture, which is measured by vehicle mounted laser, so that highway agencies can predict the skid resistance of pavement {{without the use of}} expensive and time consuming skid resistance trailer, which also causes disruption of traffic in use. In this research skid numbers and MPD from 5 new asphalt pavements and 4 old asphalt pavements were collected using a locked wheel skid trailer and a vehicle mounted laser. Using the data collected, a correlation between the <b>skid</b> <b>number</b> (SN 40 R) collected by locked wheel skid tester and the texture data or MPD collected by a vehicle mounted laser operating at highway speeds was developed. The proposed correlation for new pavements was positive for MPD values less than 0. 75  mm to reach a peak SN 40 R value, then there was a negative correlation as the MPD increases until the MPD value was equal to 1. 1  mm and beyond the MPD value of 1. 1  mm to the maximum value of 1. 4  mm, SN 40 R value remained almost constant. There were significant data scatter for the MPD value of 0. 8  mm. To explain these results, water film thickness during the friction test was calculated and the critical MPD was defined. The effect of sealed water pool on the SN 40 R was discussed. The test result showed a similar trend for older asphalt pavements, but with lower SN 40 R values due to the polishing of pavement micro-texture by traffic. Hence, a reduction factor was proposed for older pavements based on cumulative traffic volume for the above correlation to predict the skid resistance of older pavements...|$|E
40|$|Rehabilitation of poor {{conditioned}} airport pavements can be {{very expensive}} compared to the rehabilitation of relatively good conditioned airport pavements. Determining the conditions of airport pavements {{is a first step}} to determine appropriate rehabilitation method and timing. In this study, the conditions of 10 airport pavements in New Mexico are evaluated. Those airports include a total of 19 runway pavements. The major goal is to rank these airport pavements based on their functional and structural conditions. The functional conditions of the pavements are evaluated based on the field collected surface distress data and skid resistance. Field collected distress data such as rutting, cracking, and shoving are processed using MicroPaver, a commercial pavement management software, to calculate the Pavement Condition Index (PCI). Field collected skid resistance test data are processed to obtain a single value <b>Skid</b> <b>Number</b> (SN). Drilling and field coring are performed to collect samples of asphalt cores, base aggregate, and soils. These samples are then transferred to the Pavement Laboratory at the University of New Mexico for testing. Soil tests include index properties, moisture, and classification tests. Using these laboratory test results, a strength parameter called the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) value of the subgrade soils is determined. Also, the CBR value of base aggregate is determined. These CBR values are used to rank the airport pavements according to the FAA’s Advisory Circular 150 / 5320 – 6 D. Asphalt concrete cores are tested for parameters such as resilient modulus (MR), indirect tensile strength (ITS), void ratio, asphalt content, and aggregate gradation. These parameters are used to determine the structural strength of a pavement in this study. Based on the PCI value, 5 out of 19 runway pavements are found to be in poor condition. These pavements have a PCI value of less than 55. The PCI value is used in pavement rehabilitation design. Based on the SN value, 6 out of 18 runway pavements are found to be in poor condition. Their SN values are below the minimum required value of 50. Low skid resistance can pose a threat to the safe operation of aircrafts on pavements during wet weather conditions. When PCI and SN values are combined to estimate the overall functional condition, 7 runway pavements are shown to be in poor condition, 7 in fair condition, and 4 in good condition. Based on the subgrade CBR value, all the runway pavements look good because they passed the minimum required CBR value of 15 for subgrade. Based on the base course CBR value, all the pavements can be considered to have a fair to good base course. Ranking based on subgrade and base course CBR is important. A subgrade with a poor CBR value may need expensive rehabilitation measures because it requires removing the surface and base course in order to fix the subgrade. CBR value is useful for Aircraft Classification Number – Pavement Classification Number (ACN-PCN) based rating of pavements. Based on the resilient modulus of asphalt concrete (MR), only one runway has shown to have poor performance with a value of 183. 6 ksi, 3 runways have fair MR values, and 10 runways have satisfactory MR values. An indirect tension modulus of 300 ksi is considered to be good for existing surface course. The MR value is used in mechanistic design of roadway pavements, however, it has not been adopted in airport pavement design yet. Based on the ITS value, all the pavements are in good condition. A pavement having an ITS value of greater than 100 psi is considered to be in good condition in this study. A pavement with a low ITS value is more likely to develop low temperature cracks during winter seasons. In addition to strength and modulus of asphalt cores, mix design parameters such as asphalt content, air voids, and aggregate gradation of surface course are determined. Five runways have over 7 % air voids, 7 runways have between 4 - 7 % air voids, and 2 runways have less than 3 % air voids. A high percent of air voids can lead to higher permeability and moisture damage problems. Low air voids can lead to rutting problems. Five runways have more than 7 % asphalt content, and nine runways have 5 - 7 % asphalt content. Low asphalt content (2 - 3 %) can be a problem in terms of pavement durability. Based on the structural strength calculated using CBR, MR, and ITS, 1 runway is in poor condition, 9 in satisfactory condition, and 4 in good condition. Overall, based on combined functional and structural strength, 2 runways are in poor condition, 6 runways in fair condition, 4 runways in satisfactory condition, and 2 runways in good condition. It is hoped that this ranking will help design the future alternative rehabilitations when it is time to apply such rehabilitation alternatives.

40|$|Pavements {{encompass}} {{a significant}} {{component of the}} total civil infrastructure investment. In Ontario, the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) {{is responsible for the}} maintenance and construction of approximately 39, 000 lane-kilometres of highway. In 2004, the province estimated the value of the total highway system at $ 39 billion dollars. Thus, managing this asset is an important factor to ensure a high level of service to the traveling public. One of the most important indicators of level of service for a road network is safety. Each year, thousands of motorists across North America are involved in motor vehicle collisions, which result in property damage, congestion, delays, injuries and fatalities. The MTO estimated that in 2002, vehicle collisions in Ontario cost nearly $ 11 billion. Despite the importance of highway safety, it is usually not considered explicitly in the pavement management framework or maintenance analysis. A number of agencies across North America collect skid data to assess the level of safety at both the project and network level (Li et al, 2004). However, a number of transportation agencies still do not collect friction data as part of their regular pavement data collection programs. This is related to both liability concerns and lack of knowledge for how this data can be effectively used to improve safety. The transportation industry generally relies on information such as collision rates, black-spot locations and radius of curvature to evaluate the level of safety of an alignment (Lamm et al., 1999). These are important factors, but the use of complementary skid data in an organized proactive manner would also be beneficial. In preparation for a considered Long Term Area Maintenance Contract, a project was initiated by the MTO to collect network level friction data across three regions in the Province of Ontario. This project represents the first time friction data was collected at the network level in Ontario. In 2006, approximately 1, 800 km of the MTO highway network was surveyed as a part of this study. This research utilized the network level skid data along with collision data to examine the relationships and model the impacts of skid resistance on the level of safety. Despite the value of collecting network level skid data, many Canadian transportation agencies still do not collect network level skid data due to the costs and potential liability associated with the collected data. The safety of highway networks are usually assessed using various levels of service indicators such as Wet-to-Dry accident ratio (W/D), surface friction (SN), or the collision rate (CR). This research focused on developing a framework for assessing the level of safety of a highway network in terms of the risk of collision based on pavement surface friction. The developed safety framework can be used by transportation agencies (federal, state, provincial, municipal, etc.) or the private sector to evaluate the safety of their highway networks and to determine the risk or probability of a collision occurring given the level of friction along the pavement section of interest. As a part of the analysis, a number of factors such as Region, Season of the Year, Environmental Conditions, Road Surface Condition, Collision Severity, Visibility and Roadway Location were all investigated. Statistical analysis and modeling were performed to developed relationships which could relate the total number of collisions or the collision rate (CR) to the level of available pavement friction on a highway section. These models were developed using over 1, 200 collisions and skid test results from two Regions in the Province of Ontario. Another component of this study examined the Wet-to-Dry accident ratio and compared it to the <b>Skid</b> <b>Number.</b> A number of Transportation Agencies rely on the Wet-to-Dry accident ratio to identify potential locations with poor skid resistance. The results of the comparison further demonstrated the need and importance of collecting network level skid data. Another component {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of various preservation treatments used within the Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) study. In addition, modeling was performed which examined the historical friction trends over time within various environment zones across North America to investigate skid resistance deterioration trends. The results of the analysis demonstrated that commonly used preservation treatments can increase skid resistance and improve safety. The cost effectiveness of implementing preservation and maintenance to increase the level of safety of a highway using Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) was evaluated. A Decision Making Framework was developed which included the formulation of a Decision Matrix that can be used to assist in selecting a preservation treatment for a given condition. The results of this analysis demonstrate the savings generated by reducing the number of collisions as a result of increasing skid resistance. 	The results of this research study have demonstrated the importance of network level friction testing and the impact of skid resistance on the level of safety of a highway. A review of the literature did not reveal any protocol or procedures for sampling or minimum test interval requirements for network level skid testing using a locked-wheel tester. Network level friction testing can be characterized as expensive and time-consuming due to the complexity of the test. As a result, any reduction in the required number of test points is a benefit to the transportation agency, private sector (consultants and contractors) and most importantly, the public. An analysis approach was developed and tested that can be used to minimize the number of required test locations along a highway segment using common statistical techniques...|$|E
