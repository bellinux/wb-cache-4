5000|$|Tragopan is a genus of bird in {{the family}} Phasianidae. These birds are {{commonly}} called [...] "horned pheasants" [...] because of two brightly colored, fleshy horns on their heads that they can erect during courtship displays. The scientific name refers to this, being a composite of tragus (billy goat) and the ribald half-goat deity Pan (and {{in the case of}} the <b>satyr</b> <b>tragopan,</b> adding Pan's companions for even more emphasis). Their habit of nesting in trees is unique among phasianids.|$|E

The male is a stocky red-and-orange bird with white-spotted plumage, black bill and pink legs. It has a bare blue facial skin, inflatable dark-blue lappet and horns. The female is a white-spotted brown bird with blue circular eye skin.Its appearance resembles the <b>satyr</b> <b>tragopan,</b> {{but unlike the}} latter species it has all red upperbody plumage and orange collar. The diet consists mainly of berries, grass and plants.|$|E
50|$|Phrumsengla is a {{temperate}} {{park with}} {{large tracts of}} old-growth fir forests, its altitudes ranging from 700 m to 4,400 m. Phrumsengla is home to six species of threatened birds: the rufous-necked hornbill (Aceros nipalensis), rufous-throated wren-babbler (Spelaeornis caudatus), <b>satyr</b> <b>tragopan</b> (Tragopan satyra), beautiful nuthatch (Sitta formosa), Ward's trogon (Harpactes wardi) and Chestnut-breasted partridge (Arborophila mandellii), {{as well as the}} near-threatened wedge billed wren babbler (Sphenocichla humei). Phrumsengla has scenic views, including forests ranging with elevations from alpine to sub-tropical. Because the soil of Phrumsengla's biomes is particularly fragile, the land is unsuitable for logging or other development.|$|E
50|$|The zoo {{includes}} an off-display breeding center for snow leopards and red pandas. Captive breeding of snow leopards {{was started in}} 1983, with leopards which {{were brought to the}} zoo from Zurich, the United States, and Leh-Ladakh. The red panda program was started in 1994 with individuals from the Cologne Zoo, the Madrid Zoo, Belgium, and the Rotterdam Zoo. In addition to these species, the zoo is breeding the Himalayan tahr, blue sheep, Himalayan monal, grey peacock pheasant, Himalayan salamander, blood pheasant and <b>satyr</b> <b>tragopan.</b> The zoo is famous for its conservation breeding programmes of the red panda, Himalayan salamander, Tibetan wolf, and snow leopard.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} diet composition of threatened pheasant species i. e. <b>Satyr</b> <b>Tragopan</b> Tragopan satyra, Himalayan Monal Lophophorus impejanus, Kaleej Lophura leucomelana and Koklass Pucrasia macrolopha in their native forest which was never studied earlier. A study was conducted in the Kumaon region of western Himalaya for two years by collecting dropping material. Faeces were identified through direct sighting of defecating species. The diet items of each pheasant species mainly comprised plant materials followed by invertebrates and grit. A significant difference was observed in consuming food items by all pheasant species. Monal emerged as a specialist feeder on plants which were not eaten by other species. The Satyr and Koklass were more similar in terms of diet composition in both seasons while Kaleej and Monal were least similar, only invertebrates and grit were common in the diet of these species. No significant difference was observed in diet composition in different seasons of all pheasant species. The results expected to provide valuable information for the management of these pheasants in Himalayas...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Altitudinal {{migration}} {{systems are}} poorly understood. Recent advances in animal telemetry which enables tracking of migrants across their annual cycles will help illustrate unknown migration patterns and test existing hypotheses. Using telemetry, we show {{the existence of}} a complex partial altitudinal migration system in the Himalayas and discuss our findings to help better understand partial and altitudinal migration. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used GPS/accelerometer tags to monitor the migration of <b>Satyr</b> <b>tragopan</b> (Tragopan satyra) in the Bhutan Himalayas. We tagged 38 birds from 2009 - 2011 and found that tragopans are partially migratory. Fall migration lasted from the 3 (rd) week of September till the 3 (rd) week of November with migrants traveling distances ranging from 1. 25 km to 13. 5 km over 1 to 32 days. Snowfall did not influence the onset of migration. Return migration started by the 1 (st) week of March and lasted until the 1 (st) week of April. Individuals returned within 4 to 10 days and displayed site fidelity. One bird switched from being a migrant to a non-migrant. Tragopans displayed three main migration patterns: 1) crossing multiple mountains; 2) descending/ascending longitudinally; 3) moving higher up in winter and lower down in summer. More females migrated than males; but, within males, body size was not a factor for predicting migrants. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our observations of migrants traversing over multiple mountain ridges and even of others climbing to higher elevations is novel. We support the need for existing hypotheses to consider how best to explain inter- as well as intra-sexual differences. Most importantly, having shown that the patterns of an altitudinal migration system are complex and not a simple up and down slope movement, we hope our findings will influence the way altitudinal migrations are perceived and thereby contribute {{to a better understanding of}} how species may respond to climate change...|$|E
40|$|The Blood Pheasant Ithaginis cruentus, <b>Satyr</b> <b>Tragopan</b> Tragopan Satyra, Koklass Pheasant Pucrasia macrolopha, and Himalayan Monal Lophophurus impeyanus, {{were studied}} {{for seven months}} in the South Annapurna region, North of Pokhara, Nepal, in 1979 and 1980. Study was {{concentrated}} in the Pipar area, between 3000 m and 4000 m altitude, where population densities were estimated by counting the numbers of calling males (Tragopan and Koklass), and by Direct Counts of birds (Blood Pheasant and Monal). Population densities ranged from 2. 5 t o 4. 8 pairs per km {{for the first three}} species, and although a slight decline was noted in the 1980 densities, the populations were considered to be quite healthy. An assessment of the habit at preferences of each species was made, which showed that these overlapped considerably. Diet and feeding behaviour were studied and compared with observations made by previous workers. All species showed overlapping food preferences, but these were different in detail. Aspects of the behaviour of each species were studied, including protective behaviour, daily activities, breeding behaviour, and vocalizations. The latter were tape recorded, analysed sonagraphically, and most are described here in detail. The male Tragopan and Koklass were observed to make dawn challenge calls; the function of these and the calls of the other species are discussed. Observations made on breeding biology and territoriality were compared with those in the literature and are also discussed. A fifth species, the Cheer Pheasant Catreus wallichii, was sought for in the Athhazar Parbat region, North-west of Pokhara, Nepal. A small population was located in 1980, and observations were made on these for four days in May. The Cheer is included in the relevant sections along with the other four species. A study of human influence on all the species was undertaken, which included the effects of livestock herds, hunting, burning, and forest clearance. In the South Anna puma region, pressure on the pheasants was not considered to be too great at present, but it is thought likely to increase in the near future. The status of the study species is considered and recommendations for their conservationare made. These include the setting up of a reserve, regulations for hunting, forest production and pastoralism, and recommendations for education and research...|$|E
