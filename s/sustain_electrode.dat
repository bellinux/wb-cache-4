40|$|The {{width of}} an address {{electrode}} {{is an important}} parameter to affect both the address and sustain discharge characteristics in AC-PDP. It is found numerically that as the width of an address electrode is wider, the capacitance between the <b>sustain</b> and address <b>electrodes</b> (CAY) increases but the capacitance between the two <b>sustain</b> <b>electrodes</b> (CXY) decreases. The resultant changes in the sustain and address discharge characteristics, such as a firing voltage, sustain voltage, discharge delay time and full-white luminance were examined in the 50 -in. ac-PDP with a high Xe (> 10 %) content. The increase in the address electrode width causes {{an increase in the}} firing and sustain voltage between the <b>sustain</b> <b>electrodes,</b> which are due to the decrease in the capacitance between two <b>sustain</b> <b>electrodes</b> and the increase in the wall charges accumulation toward the address electrode. In particular, the full-white luminance increases with an increase in the address electrode width. As the address electrode width becomes broaden, the sustain discharge path is lengthened toward the address electrode and the discharge volume is also enlarged. Therefore, the amount of the IR, VUV and Ne rays can be emitted considerably. 1...|$|R

The result shows that the surface charge distributions on <b>sustain</b> and address <b>electrodes</b> after reset period are almost same independent of the initial conditions which are result from the sustain discharge at previous subfield.

Many research works are done to optimize the operation of these panels. A positive column discharge application seems an appreciable solution. A study of a plasma display panel cell functioning in the positive column regime is undertaken. The two-dimensional fluid model on which this work is based shows that the geometry and the physical parameters of the cell play an important role in the limitations of the discharge efficiency.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{importance}} and/or mechanisms of biological mineral oxidation in sediments, partially due to the difficulties associated with culturing mineral-oxidizing microbes. We demonstrate that electrochemical enrichment is a feasible approach for isolation of microbes capable of gaining electrons from insoluble minerals. To this end we constructed sediment microcosms and incubated electrodes at various controlled redox potentials. Negative current production was observed in incubations and increased as redox potential decreased (tested - 50 to - 400 mV vs Ag/AgCl). Electrode-associated biomass responded to the addition of nitrate and ferric iron as terminal electron acceptors in secondary sediment-free enrichments. Elemental sulfur, elemental iron and amorphous iron sulfide enrichments derived from electrode biomass demonstrated products indicative of sulfur or iron oxidation. The microbes isolated from these enrichments belong to the genera Halomonas, Idiomarina, Marinobacter, and Pseudomonas of the Gammaproteobacteria, and Thalassospira and Thioclava from the Alphaproteobacteria. Chronoamperometry data demonstrates <b>sustained</b> <b>electrode</b> oxidation from these isolates in the absence of alternate electron sources. Cyclic voltammetry demonstrated the variability in dominant electron transfer modes or interactions with electrodes (i. e., biofilm, planktonic or mediator facilitated) and the wide range of midpoint potentials observed for each microbe (from 8 to - 295 mV vs. Ag/AgCl). The diversity of extracellular electron transfer mechanisms observed in one sediment and one redox condition, illustrates the potential importance and abundance of these interactions. This approach has promise for increasing our understanding the extent and diversity of microbe mineral interactions, as well as increasing the repository of microbes available for electrochemical applications...|$|R

Subsequently, the theory and applications of faradaic rectification due to a single electrode reaction have been developed by several workers 2 - 5. The theory and application of faradaic rectification {{in the case of}} a corrosion cell <b>sustaining</b> mixed <b>electrode</b> reactions on a corroding metal was reported recently 6 " 7. This led to the development of a new electrochemical method of corrosion rate determination. It was shown that changes in the instantaneous corrosion rates of a metal are readily evaluated by faradaic rectification measurements at the corrosion potential of the metal in a given medium. The aim of the present work is to show that absolute values of instantaneous corrosion rates may also be obtained by the new method under certain conditions. The practical advantages that arise from this development are pointed out...|$|R
40|$|The design, fabrication, and {{characterization}} of a surface micromachined plasma generator is described {{for the first}} time. The plasma is <b>sustained</b> without <b>electrodes</b> by inductively coupling a 450 MHz current into a region of lowpressure gas. Both argon and air plasmas have been generated over a range of gas pressures from 0. 1 torr to 10 torr (13. 3 Pa- 1333 Pa). Typically, the power used to sustain the plasma is 350 mW, although ~ 1. 5 W is required to initiate the discharge. Network analysis of the plasma generator circuit shows that over 99 % of the applied RF power can be absorbed by the device. Of this, ~ 50 % is absorbed by the plasma and {{the remainder of the}} power is dissipated as ohmic heating. An argon ion current of up to 4. 5 mA/cm 2 has been extracted from the plasma and the electron temperature is 52, 000 K at 0. 1 torr. This plasma source is intended for electronic excitation of gas samples so that the presence of A miniaturized device for th...|$|R
40|$|An off-on {{switching}} {{scheme is}} introduced which blocks a waveguide {{path in the}} passive off-state and transmits the signal in the active on-state. The operating principle {{is based on the}} self-diffraction of a narrow guided beam when it escapes from a waveguide with two-dimensional confinement into a region of appropriate length with basically one-dimensional confinement. In particular, a remaining interface of the initial waveguide superimposes reflection, which in sum results in a very efficient asymmetrical blow out of the guided power. In the active on-state, low-loss waveguiding is <b>sustained</b> when an <b>electrode</b> causes an appropriate refractive index change, e. g., due to the thermo-optical effect. Thus, the signal is received in the output waveguide, the identical counterpart of the input guide. The switching behaviour is almost binary with minimal wavelength dependence. This makes the device useful for switching and modulation in a multi-wavelength optical network. For a realistic poly meric waveguide configuration, simulations indicate on-off signal ratios of > 30 dll. This satisfies the requirements for crosstalk reduction in switching networks...|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{conductance}} {{of a series}} of amine-terminated oligophenyl and alkane molecular junctions formed with Ag and Au electrodes using the scanning tunneling microscope based break-junction technique. For these molecules that conduct through the highest occupied molecular orbital, junctions formed with Au electrodes are more conductive than those formed with Ag electrodes, consistent with the lower work function for Ag. The measured conductance decays exponentially with molecular backbone length with a decay constant that is essentially the same for Ag and Au electrodes. However, the formation and evolution of molecular junctions upon elongation are very different for these two metals. Specifically, junctions formed with Ag <b>electrodes</b> <b>sustain</b> significantly longer elongation when compared with Au due to a difference in the initial gap opened up when the metal point-contact is broken. Using this observation and density functional theory calculations of junction structure and conductance we explain the trends observed in the single molecule junction conductance. Our work thus opens a new path to the conductance measurements of a single molecule junction in Ag electrodes...|$|R

The theory assumes, {{that the}} {{particles}} of the dielectric (now an electrolyte) {{are in the}} first instance brought, by ordinary inductive action, into a polarized state, and raised to a certain degree of tension or intensity before discharge commences; the inductive state being, in fact, a necessary preliminary to discharge. By taking advantage of those circumstances which bear upon the point, {{it is not difficult to}} increase the tension indicative of this state of induction, and so make the state itself more evident. Thus, if distilled water be employed, and a long narrow portion of it placed between the electrodes of a powerful voltaic battery, we have at once indications of the intensity which can be <b>sustained</b> at these <b>electrodes</b> by the inductive action through the water as a dielectric, for sparks may be obtained, gold leaves diverged, and Leyden bottles charged at their wires. The water is in the condition of the spermaceti (1322. 1323.) a bad conductor and a bad insulator; but what it does insulate is by virtue of inductive action, and that induction is the preparation for and precursor of discharge (1338.).|$|R
40|$|A new off-on {{switching}} {{scheme is}} introduced which blocks a waveguide {{path in the}} passive off-state and transmits the signal in the active on-state.

Calculations sh ow on-off signal ratios of better than 30 dB e. g. in a polymeric waveguide configuration of 3 min length. This is nicely adapted to the demands of crosstalk reduction in switching networks.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 An {{atmospheric}} pressure argon glow discharge {{is shown to}} detect trace levels of carbohydrates in aqueous flowing systems, using either of two glow discharge solution interface configurations. The first configuration consists of an oscillating glow discharge sustained between a flowing aqueous cathode and platinum anode. Picomole and micromolar mass and concentration detection limits, respectively, are obtained for sucrose in an aqueous flow injection system when monitoring discharge oscillation frequency or discharge current. The second configuration consists of a non-oscillating glow discharge <b>sustained</b> between metallic <b>electrodes</b> near the flowing output of a high performance liquid chromatography system. A conductivity detector detects the acidic product formed when each carbohydrate elutes and is exposed to the glow discharge. This detector yields femtomole and nanomolar mass and concentration detection limits, respectively, {{for a variety of}} carbohydrates and competes with the best of the commercially available liquid chromatography carbohydrate detectors. An increase in the discharge electrode spacing or reduction in the liquid flow rate increases detector sensitivity, since the discharge area and solution exposure time are increased, respectively. The aqueous carbohydrate products formed from exposure to the glow discharge are similar to those formed from exposure to high energy radiation. Acid, hydrogen peroxide, and an absorbing species all form in amounts proportional to carbohydrate concentration and glow discharge exposure time, with yields approximating those encountered when using high energy radiation...|$|R
40|$|Department of Energy Engineering(Battery Science and Technology) In {{order to}} keep pace with the {{increasing}} energy demands for advanced electronic devices and to achieve commercialization of electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESSs), improvements in high energy battery technology are required. In this regard, Si anodes have been studied as one of the most promising alternative electrode materials for next-generation high energy LIBs systems. Pristine Si exhibits high reversible capacities of 3579 mAh g- 1 which is 10 times higher than conventional graphite anode at room temperature. However, even though Si has high gravimetric and volumetric capacities, it undergoes intrinsic drawbacks such as low initial Coulombic efficiency, electrical disconnection and fracture as well as continuous formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) caused by huge volume changes during cycling, leading to rapid capacity fading and increase in internal impedance. Although intensive researches with variously engineered Si have provided some enhanced electrochemical performances, they could not be a comprehensive solution, which prevent practical applications in high energy LIB anodes. In this study, to overcome this barrier, novel structure characterization methods and fundamental understanding are proposed in this dissertation. 1) 	Amorphous (a) silicon nanoparticles backboned-graphene nanocomposite (a-SBG) for high-power lithium-ion battery anodes allows improved electrical conductivity and stable <b>electrode</b> deformation with <b>sustaining</b> interconnectivity between <b>electrode</b> components. The a-SBG provides ideal electrode structures-a uniform distribution of amorphous silicon nanoparticle islands (particle size < 10 nm) anchored on both sides of graphene sheets-which address the improved kinetics and cycling stability issues of the silicon anodes. Especially, a-Si in the composite shows elastic behavior during lithium alloying and dealloying reactions: the pristine particle size is restored after cycling, and the electrode thickness decreases during the cycles as a result of self-compacting. This noble architecture facilitates superior electrochemical performance in Li-ion cells, with a specific energy of 468 Wh kg- 1 and 288 Wh kg- 1 under a specific power of 7 kW kg- 1 and 11 kW kg- 1, respectively. 2) 	With developing an industrial-relevant equipment using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, Si nanolayer-embedded graphite/carbon hybrid (SGC) has succeeded in achieving high energy density (1043 mAh l- 1), and unprecedented Coulombic efficiency (92...|$|R
40|$|Epilepsy is a {{neurological}} disorder with varied expression. Patients with focal onset seizures that {{are resistant to}} medications can benefit from ablative surgery. However, localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and characterization of propagation to secondary areas can be challenging. The present study aimed at developing the appropriate signal processing methodology to detect bursts of interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), as a possible signature of the SOZ, in patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Additionally, invasive interictal and ictal intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data and non-invasive electromagnetic source imaging with magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from three subjects were analyzed. We developed a novel algorithm that extracts HFO bursts from the envelope of iEEG and MEG traces in the [80 - 300] Hz range. Clusters of HFO events across multichannel iEEG traces were subsequently analyzed to investigate their relative time delays and to infer possible propagation patterns during the interictal period and episodes of ictal onset (iEEG only). The location of iEEG <b>electrodes</b> <b>sustaining</b> the HFO bursts were labeled {{with respect to the}} chronometry of the local HFOs. The recording site bearing the smallest rank was labeled as the lead generator of HFO discharges. The aim of using MEG traces was essentially to determine probable SOZ locations non-invasively by extending the results obtained with iEEG. We proposed a new metric referred to as `spiking index 2 ̆ 7 that was computed at each cortical site in the vicinity of iEEG electrode locations (iEEG and MEG data were obtained for the same patients: iEEG was considered as the standard of reference for MEG results). The sensitivity and specificity of the HFO detector operating from ongoing brain traces were evaluated. Our results indicate that higher values of spiking index and higher rates of HFOs corresponded to brain regions that were identified independently as the SOZ by an expert clinician and as determined by the location and extent of the cortical resection that freed the patients from the seizures. Interictal and ictal iEEG HFO localization showed good concordance with the location of resected areas. The use of interictal data only, if used for surgical planning, would reduce the time required for making decisions regarding the resection of cortex and improve the chances of success of surgery in making patients become seizure-free. Obtaining iEEG data is invasive, with possible risks to the patients, and requires an expensive procedure. Another fundamental disadvantage of iEEG is that the implanted electrode grids and strips needed to cover the supposed abnormal cortical areas for proper determination of the SOZ. Our results indicate that the spiking index and rate map obtained from MEG source maps may provide a non-invasive alternative for determination of the SOZ and may provide greater accuracy to the placement of the implantable electrodes, and eventually avoid an invasive exploratory procedure before surgery...|$|R
