40|$|Members of the spectrin {{superfamily}} {{of proteins}} contain different numbers of homologous repeats arranged in tandem. Each of these {{consists of a}} three-alpha-helix motif, comprising two similarly and one oppositely directed alpha-helical segment joined by nonhelical linkers of characteristic length. The right-handed alpha-helices each display a heptad repeat in their amino acid sequences indicative of left-handed coiled-coil-like packing. We have calculated the potential number of inter-helix ionic interactions that specify the spatial arrangement of the helices in the motif {{in terms of both}} the handedness of helix connectivity (left or right) and the relative axial <b>stagger</b> <b>between</b> the three alpha-helices. All of the models examined were constrained to have optimal coiled-coil packing. For alpha-spectrin and alpha-actinin the results provide strong support for a left-handed connectivity of the three helices and axial repeat lengths of 5. 05 and 6. 24 nm, respectively. Furthermore, the axial <b>staggers</b> <b>between</b> homologous segments in the preferred models are identical. The insights provided into the topography of this widespread tertiary fold may prove of value to those concerned with the problem of de novo protein design...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} The authors undertook {{an updated}} systematic {{review of the}} relationship <b>between</b> <b>body</b> mass index and dental caries in children and adolescents.

All empirical papers that tested associations <b>between</b> <b>body</b> mass index and dental caries in child and adolescent populations (aged 0 to 18 years) were included. Results Dental caries is associated with both high and low body mass index. Conclusion A non-linear association <b>between</b> <b>body</b> mass index and dental caries may account for inconsistent findings in previous research. We recommend future research investigate {{the nature of the}} association <b>between</b> <b>body</b> mass index and dental caries in samples that include a full range of body mass index scores, and explore how factors such as socioeconomic status mediate the association <b>between</b> <b>body</b> mass index and dental caries. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate the correlation <b>between</b> <b>body</b> weight and body conformation of two broiler strains. A total of 200 broiler chickens comprising of 100 Hubbard and 100 Arboracre strains were used in the determination of their correlation <b>between</b> <b>body</b> weight and body conformation from day old to 8 weeks (0 - 8 weeks) of age. Weekly body weight and body conformations like shank length, keel length, breast width, back length and neck length were taken thrice in a week and the correlation <b>between</b> <b>body</b> weight and the body conformations were computed at the 8 th week of the experiment for both strains. Hubbard broiler strain had the correlation of 0. 9416, 0. 894, 0. 861, 0. 897 and 0. 963 <b>between</b> <b>body</b> weight and other body conformation while for Arboracre strain, the correlation of 0. 967, 0. 974, 0. 882, 2. 935, 0. 981 and 0. 969 were obtained <b>between</b> <b>body</b> weight and back length, shank length, thigh length, keel length, breast width and back length respectively. The correlation <b>between</b> other <b>body</b> conformations range <b>between</b> 0. 977 and 0. 795, all indicating strong positive correlations.
