5|$|The third {{match on}} the card was a Straight Edge Society pledge vs. hair match, between CM Punk and Rey Mysterio. For this match, the other Straight Edge <b>Society</b> <b>members</b> (Serena and Luke Gallows) were banned from ringside. Early on in the match, Punk threw Mysterio headfirst {{out of the ring}} into the barber chair at ringside. Punk had {{suffered}} a cut to the head prior to the exchange, and while Mysterio was on the floor, the match was halted so that the blood could be cleaned up. While Punk's wound was being attended, he dropkicked Mysterio, who was on the ring apron, and began attacking him on the floor to restart the match. After Mysterio missed a splash from the top rope, Punk went to pin him, but Mysterio was able to perform a crucifix cradle on Punk for the victory. The other Straight Edge <b>Society</b> <b>members</b> attacked Mysterio after the match, but he was saved by Kane, which allowed Mysterio to handcuff Punk to the ring ropes and shave his head.|$|E

5|$|A flashforward {{occurs in}} the narration, to find Daniel's ship under attack by the fleet of Edward Teach (Blackbeard) in 1713. Then the story returns to the past as Daniel and Newton return to London: Newton is under the {{patronage}} of Louis Anglesey, the Earl of Upnor, and Daniel becomes secretary of the Royal Society when Henry Oldenburg is detained by the King for his active foreign correspondence. During his stint in London, Daniel encounters {{a number of important}} actors from the period. Daniel remains one of the more prominent actors in the Royal Society, close to Royal <b>Society</b> <b>members</b> involved in court life and politics.

Daniel convinces Newton to present his work on calculus to the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{difficulties}} prevented Breckinridge's {{return to}} college. He {{did not seek}} reelection in 1782; instead, he spent a year earning money by surveying, and was reelected to the House of Delegates in 1783, joining his legislative colleagues in May. He also joined the Constitutional Society of Virginia; fellow <b>society</b> <b>members</b> included future U.S. presidents James Madison and James Monroe. The House adjourned June 28, 1783, and Breckinridge returned to William and Mary, studying {{through the end of}} the year, excepting the legislative session in November and December. With the war over, he urged that no economic or political penalties be imposed on former Loyalists. In contrast to his later political views, he desired a stronger central government than provided for in the Articles of Confederation; he argued that the national government could not survive unless it could tax its citizens, a power it did not have under the Articles.|$|E
5|$|Following the war's end, only 400 {{out of the}} library's nearly 3,000 volumes {{could be}} recovered, with only 200 of those books {{remaining}} on the library's shelves. Between 10 and 20 of the library's recovered volumes only contained three to four of their original books. The value of the recovered volumes was degraded, as many were damaged or broken. The <b>society</b> <b>members</b> that returned home to Romney were too war-weary to revive the society when they discovered {{the ruins of the}} Romney Classical Institute and its library, which had been an expensive endeavor to accumulate and took almost a half-century of labor to amass. The Romney Classical Institute was not restored and was in effect disestablished on account of the war.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by Hirschfeld's {{work with}} the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Gerber {{resolved}} to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (the English translation of Bund für Menschenrecht) and took {{on the role of}} secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined the goals and purposes of the Society: o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as they protect the rights of others, and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to the public welfare. An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation. Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement, <b>Society</b> <b>members</b> were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter.|$|E
