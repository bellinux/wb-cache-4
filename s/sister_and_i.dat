In New York in 1930, and later in London (where it flopped), he starred in Ralph Benatzky's My <b>Sister</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> (aka Meet My Sister). He also appeared in at least ten films for London Film Productions Ltd. in the 1930s. In 1930, he appeared in a 20th Century Fox film, Are You There?.|$|E
25|$|Around 1954, {{parties were}} held at Florance's house, {{referred}} to as 'The Hovel'. According to Peter Oyston: over those years my <b>sister</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> worked out that we had 82 callers a week, not counting those who came more than once. It was constant open house. My stepfather would start a party with his muso friends while my mother was at the theatre. And then my mother would bring back the cast and any {{people who came to}} see the shows. And the taxi drivers and, if the police called to quieten us up, then the police would be invited in and they'd join the party too. It really was an extraordinary time.|$|E
25|$|Howes {{moved to}} the family's country house in Essendon, Hertfordshire for the {{duration}} of World War II. She was a show-business baby who lived a quiet, orderly childhood where she grew up with a nanny and was surrounded by a variety of pets and her parents' theatrical peers, including actor/writer Jack Hulbert and his wife, actress Cicely Courtneidge, who had an adjoining house. Her first taste of the stage was school productions, but as she came from a theatrical family, it was inevitable that another family friend, an agent who was visiting the Howes family for dinner, became impressed with her and not long after suggested the young Sally Ann for a role in a movie. Two hundred young girls had already been screen tested without success, and the producers were desperate to find a talented little girl to play the lead, and they asked her father to please rush in some pictures on the recommendation of the agent. The movie, Thursday's Child, was written by playwright and screenwriter Rodney Ackland, also a close neighbour to the Howes family, and it would become Ackland's directorial debut. Thursday's Child (1943) launched her career. A second film, The Halfway House (1944), led to her being put under contract by Michael Balcon of Ealing Studios, and this was followed by many other film roles as a child actress, including Dead of Night (1945) with Sir Michael Redgrave, Pink String and Sealing Wax (1946), Nicholas Nickleby (1947), My <b>Sister</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> (1948) and Anna Karenina (1948), with Vivien Leigh.|$|E

500|$|The former {{president}} {{was quoted in}} 1957 as saying to then-House Majority Leader John McCormack, [...] "Had {{it not been for}} the fact that I was able to sell some property that my brother, <b>sister,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> inherited from our mother, I would practically be on relief, but with the sale of that property I am not financially embarrassed." [...] The following year, Congress passed the Former Presidents Act, offering a $25,000 yearly pension to each {{former president}}, and it is likely that Truman's financial status played a role in the law's enactment. The one other living former president at the time, Herbert Hoover, also took the pension, even though he did not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing Truman.|$|E
500|$|The subplot with Stan getting beat up by {{his sister}} Shelley came from Parker's real-life {{experiences}} getting beat up as a child by his sister, also named Shelley, who is three years his elder. Parker said although his sister would later deny it, she regularly beat him up or locked {{him out of the}} house for hours; Parker stated that the scene when Stan says [...] "You're my <b>sister</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> love you" [...] in order to try to avoid a beating, but was subsequently beat even harder, was based on an actual experience with his sister. The scene in which Stan asks the giant mutant Stan to attack Shelley is based on Parker's childhood fantasy of having a larger version of himself beat up his sister. The resolution to the subplot, in which Shelley takes the blame for Stan's mistakes, and then beats up Stan when he tries to thank her, was also based on experiences Parker had when his sister would bail him out of trouble.|$|E
500|$|On May 10, 1983, Howard Emerson, the {{adviser to}} the journalism class, {{submitted}} page proofs of the May 13 issue of the newspaper to principal Robert Eugene Reynolds for approval, a practice that was customary at the time. Reynolds objected {{to two of the}} stories scheduled to run. One was about teen pregnancy, containing interviews with three students who had been pregnant. The story used false names to keep the girls' identities a secret, but Reynolds was concerned that the students would still be identifiable from the text. He was also concerned that the references to sexual activity and birth control were inappropriate for younger students at the school. The second story was about divorce and featured an interview with a student whose parents were divorced, in which she complained that her father [...] "wasn't spending enough time with my mom, my <b>sister,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> ... was always out of town on business or out late playing cards with the guys ... always argued about everything". Reynolds, unaware that the girl's name would also be changed, argued that her family should have been given an opportunity to respond within the story, or to object to its publication.|$|E

Prince Edward arrived in France, and gave homage in September. At this point, however, rather than returning, Isabella remained firmly in France with her son. Edward began to send urgent messages to the Pope and to Charles IV, expressing his concern about his wife's absence, but to no avail.
