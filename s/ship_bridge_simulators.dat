While the technical developmentof <b>ship</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>simulators</b> continues at a breathtaking pace, little is known on how developments fulfiltheir intended safety critical purpose during actual simulator training exercises. In order to investigate this, a mixed-methods quasi-experimental field study (N = 6) was conductedaiming at discerning the systemic causes behind committed human errors {{and to what extent}} thesecauses can be related to the technical layout of the simulator in general and a decision supportingdisplay in particular. The nautical students’ performance in terms of committed errors was analysedwhen the decision supporting display was either inactive or active during two different exercisebatches. Drawing upon eye tracking evaluation, interviews and simulator video recordings, systemiccauses leading to human errors were identified. Results indicate that all errors occur under the samekind of (stressful) interaction. Based on this design requirements aiming at promoting resilient crewbehaviour were propose...|$|E

Common sense is usually employed by professional mariners; however, mistakes sometimes occur on training or merchant ships with multinational crews. Japanese maritime colleges have made entrance examinations and sea aptitude training easier. But professors need to pinpoint student aptitude by developing an evaluation method of kansei measuring the center of gravity and/or heart rate variability utilizing the effects of “Human Computer Interaction ” on a simulator with a visual system...|$|R

40|$|Augmented reality (AR) is an {{advanced}} technology that integrates augmentations {{with the real}} world. This technology {{has been used to}} provide training and education along with other purposes. This work has been focused on enriching the learning experience of the maritime trainee by applying AR technology. In this work, a proof of concept AR application (App) is developed for the training of the maritime students. The App was designed to introduce the selected stations and panel in the Kongsberg <b>Ship</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>Simulator</b> in Department of Engineering and Safety, UiT The Arctic University of Norway. The App is designed with four main options namely: Stations, Panel, Help and Quit. Microsoft® HoloLens has been chosen as a wearable AR device for the execution of the App. The primary reason for selecting Microsoft® HoloLens was its standalone ability. In this App design, marker-based tracking and markerless-based tracking were compared. The marker-based tracking was found to be appropriate for the maritime training. The main reason is that marker-based tracking allows to adapt to the different <b>Ship</b> <b>Bridges</b> without much of a hassle. Within marker-based tracking method, various types of markers were considered. After thoughtful consideration, AR image markers and 2 D-barcode markers were chosen. AR image markers are effective within larger range (up to 1. 5 m) hence useful to highlight the stations on the <b>Ship</b> <b>Bridge.</b> However, 2 D-barcode markers are easy to detect (consume less processing power and allow multiple markers to be detected at the same time) and hence useful on the control panels. The camera on the HoloLens has to be calibrated for the accurate tracking of the markers. The App was designed in Unity 5. 5. 1 f 1 Personal version, Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 and Windows 10 environment. The scripts were written in C# Programming Language and libraries from ARToolKit SDK, OpenCV, HoloToolKit were incorporated. Developed App is limited to operate only with the Microsoft® HoloLens.

40|$|In 2006, {{a review}} of {{maritime}} accidents found that non-technical skills (NTSs) are the single largest contributing factor towards such incidents. NTSs are composed of both interpersonal and cognitive elements. These include things such as situational awareness, teamwork, decision making, leadership, management and communication skills. In a crisis situation, good NTSs allow a deck officer to quickly recognise that a problem exists and then harness the resources that are at their disposal to safely and efficiently bring the situation back under control. This paper has two aims. The first {{is to develop a}} methodology which will enable educators to quantitatively assess the impact of Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) -approved Human Element, Leadership and Management (HELM) training on deck officer’s NTSs with a view to identifying further training requirements. The second is to determine whether the HELM training provided to develop the NTSs of trainee deck officers is fit for purpose. To achieve these aims, a three-phase approach was adopted. Initially, a taxonomy for deck officer’s NTSs is established, behavioural markers are identified and the relative importance of each attribute is calculated using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Subsequently, a set of scenarios were identified for the assessment of deck officer’s NTSs in a <b>ship</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>simulator</b> environment. A random selection of students that have completed the Chief Mate (CM) programme was performed, and data regarding their NTS-related performance in the scenarios was collected. Finally, the collected data was fed into the evidential reasoning (ER) algorithm, utility values were produced and, having established these values, the effectiveness of the HELM training that the students have received was then evaluated...|$|R

The simulated situation required the officer to act immediately and resolutely, taking into account all his/her knowledge about the ship, and interpreting the available data correctly. Outcome of this test was compared with gaze data and it was proved that experienced group with best results suffered lowest level of mental workload and was most efficient in decision making process.

40|$|Empirical {{research}} have often criticise {{the weaknesses of}} passive learning approaches to student learning i. e. traditional lecture-based and classroom-based methods, and that it falls short in many areas. These areas include the inability to accommodate {{a wide variety of}} learning styles; support of differing skills and learner capabilities of individuals; and effectively assist learners to understand complex or ill-structured problems. However, the arrival and impact of technology into education institutions have shifted the traditional paradigm of teaching and student learning. One such technology is the computer simulator. The computer simulator is designed to facilitate user-centric learning for specific applications in a simulated, virtual environment. However, relatively little research is conducted into how the simulator engage users, and specifically, the impact it has on the perceptions of higher education learners. This research explores the perceptions of engaged learning held by students of the Australian Maritime College (AMC), particularly in a team-oriented setting, in employing the use of the <b>ship</b> handling <b>bridge</b> <b>simulator.</b> The aim is to reveal selected participants' underlying attitudes, beliefs and perceptions to better understand the impact of student simulation learning. The findings from this research program will provide insight into why the AMC's ship handling simulator is so highly regarded by its students and the influence it has on the users' mindsets and behaviour towards learning. It may have contributed to why the simulation program has been so successful since its inception approximately four years ago...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{discusses}} central {{aspects of}} decision making on a <b>Ship</b> <b>Bridge</b> in its natural context with focus {{on the task of}} navigating in fairway. The background springs from the fast development of instruments related to work on the <b>ship</b> <b>bridge.</b> If not implemented and used correctly new technology may even contribute to accidents. Initially a field study and a Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) are described. These exemplify how the task of navigation in fairway can be described and uncover aspects worth further investigation. Examples of results of the field study are examples of risk, differences in expected workload between Masters and Pilots and Pilots preferences of instruments. The HTA work model is used to identify and describe ordinary problems of navigating in fairway. This is followed by a detailed proposal of a study in a full mission <b>bridge</b> <b>simulator</b> using a composite of data collection methods. The main objective of the proposed study is to compare two <b>ship</b> <b>bridge</b> types, one equipped with advanced technology and the other one equipped with traditional instruments.

40|$|Introduction: Vehicle motion {{characteristics}} differ between air, road, and sea environments, both vestibularly and visually. Effects {{of vision}} on motion sickness {{have been studied}} before, though less systematically in a naval setting. It is hypothesized that appropriate visual information on self-motion is beneficial in a naval setting and that task performance is likely reduced as sickness increases. Methods: Using a within-subjects design, 24 subjects were exposed to 30 min of motion in a <b>ship's</b> <b>bridge</b> motion <b>simulator</b> with 3 visual conditions: an Earth-fixed outside view; an inside view that moved with the subjects; and a blindfolded condition. Subjective sickness symptoms and severity were rated repeatedly before, during, and after motion exposure. During the motion, subjects performed a mental task. Results: Though not excessive, sickness was highest in the inside viewing condition, intermediate in the outside viewing condition, and least in the blindfolded condition. The blind-folded condition was equally {{as bad as the}} inside viewing condition during the first 5 - 10 min of motion exposure. The overall temporal increase of sickness during motion was about equal to the decrease during recovery. No effect of sickness on task performance was observed. Discussion: Most sickness in a naval setting is observed when the visual environment moves with the subjects, as has been reported in other environments, such as cars. Only mild sickness, caused by moderate motions, was provoked in this study and was alleviated by the performance task. A non-linear brain mechanism integrating visual and vestibular information may explain why the least sickness was observed when subjects were blindfolded...|$|R
