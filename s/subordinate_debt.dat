40|$|One of {{the aims}} of {{mandatory}} <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> is to enhance both direct and indirect market discipline.

40|$|Increasing the {{effectiveness}} of market discipline in regulated financial markets {{has emerged as a}} major policy issue for banking regulators. Perhaps the most prominent proposal for increasing market discipline is the proposal to require banks to issue publicly held <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt.</b> <b>Subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> holders can discipline banks either directly by demanding higher yields for riskier institutions or indirectly by means of market signals. This paper explores the fundamental rationale behind mandatory <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> proposals, and discusses {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the most prominent proposals. To more clearly focus the analysis, the paper concentrates on proposals for requiring publicly traded <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt,</b> and therefore our analysis is relevant only to relatively large institutions that can feasibly issue such securities. The paper does not consider the various alternative proposals for issuing <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> specifically designed for small institutions. Our analysis indicates that a <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> requirement will only modestly increase the risk sensitivity of bank costs at most large banks; however, we argue that there are substantial benefits to using <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> as a market-based trigger for regulatory action.

Estimating a discrete-time proportional odds hazard model, we find borrowers with a second loan were 62. 7 % more likely to default each month on their primary loan when conditioning alone on the attributes of the primary loan. However, borrowers of second loans were 58. 3 % less likely to default on their primary loan as compared to single loan borrowers with equivalent current combined attributes (i. e., loan-to-value, balance, and interest rate). We hypothesize and provide empirical evidence this occurs because borrowers with second loans have the option to sequentially default on each loan since subordinate lenders will not pursue foreclosure if borrowers have insufficient equity.

40|$|Abstract—With the {{drafting}} of new banking regulation via the Basel II capital accord, bank regulatory capital and its adequacy has become {{the subject of much}} debate. In our contribution, we strive to construct a stochastic dynamic model to describe the evolution of bank capital that incorporates capital gains and losses. In our paper, such gains and losses are represented by loan loss reserves and the unexpected loan losses, respectively. In this regard, we recognize that bank capital consists of Tier 1 capital (mainly equity which is modeled via an exponential Lévy process), Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital (collectively known as supplementary capital). The latter two types of capital mainly consist of (short- and long-term) <b>subordinate</b> <b>debt</b> held by debtholders and loan losses reserves. Furthermore, we setup an optimal capital management problem which maximizes the expectation of bank capital under a risk constraint on the Capital-at-Risk (CaR), where CaR is defined in terms of Valueat-Risk (VaR). In particular, we seek an optimal bank capital management strategy in a mean-CaR paradigm. Historical evidence from Organization for Economic Corporation and Development (OCED) countries assists us in establishing the relationship between output gap (as the proxy of business cycle) and capital adequacy ratios (CARs). Finally, we provide a brief analysis of some of the optimal capital management issues and suggestions for topics of possible future direction...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} effects of debt {{structure}} on conservatism. The analysis is conducted in two steps. First, I examine the direction of causality between capital structure and conditional conservatism by using a unique sample of zero leverage firms that transition to non-zero leverage. Also I investigate whether off-balance-sheet leverage incrementally explains conditional conservatism. Second, I study whether the various characteristics of debt also affect conditional conservatism. Specifically, the characteristics I investigate include: (1) whether the debt is public or private, (2) maturity, (3) convertibility, (4) seniority, and (5) securitization. Since these different characteristics of debt affect agency costs to varying degrees, I predict that differences in the type of debt will lead to cross-sectional differences in conditional conservatism. I find that entering the debt market is an important factor driving demand for conditional conservatism, and that off-balance-sheet leverage incrementally increases conditional conservatism relative to on-balance-sheet leverage. Consistent with my predictions, I find that firms with greater levels of public debt, short-term debt, <b>subordinate</b> <b>debt,</b> and unsecured debt provide more timely loss recognition. After controlling for the likelihood of conversion, I also find firms with a greater level of convertible debt provide less timely loss recognition. Overall my results indicate that accounting conservatism not only varies with the presence of debt, but also with the contractual features of debt...|$|E

The views stated herein {{are those of}} the authors and are not necessarily the views of the Federal Reserve Banks of San Francisco or New York, or the Federal Reserve System. Do banks propagate debt market shocks? Over the years, U. S. banks have increasingly relied on the bond market to finance their business. This created the potential for a link between the bond market and the corpo-rate sector whereby borrowers, including those that do not rely on bond funding, became exposed to the conditions in the bond market. We investigate the importance of this link. Our results show that when the cost to access the bond market goes up, banks that rely on bond financing charge higher interest rates on their loans. Banks that rely exclusively on deposit funding follow bond financing banks and increase the interest rates on their loans, though by smaller amounts. Further, banks pass the bond market shocks predominantly to their risky borrowers that have access to the bond market and to their borrowers that do not have access to the bond market. These results show that banks propagate shocks to the bond market by passing them through their loan policies to their borrowers, including those that do not use bond financing. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Applied Mathematics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. A topical {{issue in}} {{financial}} economics {{is the development}} of appropriate stochastic dynamic models for banking items and behavior. The issue here is to fulfil the need to generalize the more traditional discrete-time models of banking activity to a Levy process setting. In this thesis, under the assumption that the loan market is imperfectly competitive, we investigate the evolution of banking items such as bank assets (cash, bonds, shares, Treasuries, reserves, loans and intangible assets), liabilities (demand deposits) and bank capital (bank equity, <b>subordinate</b> <b>debt</b> and loan loss reserves). Here we consider the influence of macroeconomic factors and profitability as well as its indicators return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). As far as bank assets are concerned, we note that loan pricing models usually reflect the financial funding cost, risk premium to compensate for the risk of default by the borrower, a premium reflecting market power exercised by the bank and the sensitivity of the cost of capital raised to changes in loans extended. On the other hand, loan losses can be associated with an offsetting expense called the loan loss provision (LLP), which is charged against Nett profit. This offset will reduce reported income but has no impact on taxes, although when the assets are finally written off, a tax-deductible expense is created. An important factor influencing loan loss provisioning is regulation and supervision. Measures of capital adequacy are generally calculated using the book values of assets and equity. The provisioning of loans and their associated write-offs will cause a decline in these capital adequacy measures, and may precipitate increased regulation by bank authorities. Greater level of regulation generally entail additional costs for the bank. Currently, this regulation mainly takes the form of the Basel II Capital Accord that has been implemented on the worldwide basis since 2008. It is clear that bank profitability is a major indicator of financial crises for households, companies and financial institutions. An example of this from the 2007 - 2008 subprime mortgage crisis (SMC) is the U. S. bank, Wachovia Corp., who reported a big loss as from the first quarter of 2007 and eventually was bought by the world's largest bank, Citigroup, on 29 September 2008. A further example from the SMC is that both the failure of the Lehman Brothers investment bank and the acquisition in September 2008 of Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns by Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase, respectively, were preceded by a decrease in profitability and an increase in the price of loans and loan losses. The subprime mortgage crisis is characterized by contracted liquidity in the global credit markets and banking system. The level of liquidity in the banking sector affects the ability of banks to meet commitments as they become due without incurring substantial losses from liquidating less liquid assets. Liquidity, therefore, provides the defensive cash or near-cash resources to cover banks' liability. An undervaluation of real risk in the subprime market is cascading, rippling and ultimately severely adversely affecting the world economy. The downturn in the U. S. housing market, risky lending and borrowing practices, and excessive individual and corporate debt levels have caused multiple adverse effects tumbled as the US housing market slumped. Banks worldwide are hoarding cash and showing a growing reluctance to lend, driving rates that institutions charge to each other on loans to record highs. Also, global money markets are inoperative, forcing increased injections of cash from central banks. The crisis has passed through various stages, exposing pervasive weaknesses in the global financial system and regulatory framework. The stochastic dynamics of the aforementioned banking items assist in formulating a maximization problem that involves endogenous variables such as profit consumption, the value of the bank's investment in loans and provisions for loan losses as control variants. In particular, we demonstrate that the bank is able to maximize its expected utility of discounted profit consumption over a random time interval, [t,r], and terminal profit at time r. Here the term profit consumption refers to the consumption of the bank's profits by dividend payments on equity and interest and principal payments on <b>subordinate</b> <b>debt.</b> The associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation has a smooth solution when the optimal controls are computed by means of power, logarithmic and exponential utility functions. This enables us to make a direct comparison between the economic properties of the solutions for different choices of the utility function. In keeping with the main theme of this thesis, we simulate the financial indices ROE and ROA that are two measures of bank profitability. We further discuss optimization with power utility where we show the convergence of the Markov Chain Approximation Method (MCAM) and the impact of varying the model parameters in the form of loan loss severity, P, and loan loss frequency,. We investigate the connections between the banking models and Basel II capital accord as well as the current subprime mortgage crises. As a way of conclusion, we provide remarks about the main issues discussed in the thesis and speculate about future research directions. The contents of this thesis is based on 3 peer-reviewed journal articles (see [105], [106] and [107]) and 1 peer-reviewed conference proceedings paper (see [104]).

40|$|This {{research}} empirically investigates how and to {{what extent}} bank <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> plays a role in providing market discipline whereby the private sector is deployed to monitor and influence bank risk taking, hence complement government supervision and regulation of banks. The study comprises four essays on the use of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> as an instrument for creating direct and indirect market discipline, with specific reference to the case of the UK banking industry. Broadly, Chapters 2, 3 and 4 examine the effectiveness of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> as an instrument of direct market discipline; Chapter 5 approaches the issue of indirect market discipline. First, we analyse whether the risk premiums or yield spreads of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> indicate banks’ financial health. Our results show that yield spreads contain timely and accurate information on issuing banks’ risk taking, and this underpins the proposals that advocate forcing large financial institutions to issue <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> to the public on a regular basis. Then we examine whether the issued <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> and its price have any impact on banks’ performance. The results have positive signs, implying that the signalling and influencing effects of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> can induce banks to act prudently and restrain them from assuming unsound risk. However, the final chapter finds that the UK financial regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has little enthusiasm for utilizing the <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> to indirectly discipline financial institutions. This reflects the FSA’s doubt as to the usefulness of the market in providing disciplining effects. In contrast, the evidence documented in this research shows that the subordinated market proves to be sensitive to bank risk, and banks do respond to market information, hence it can be an effective mechanism for generating useful market discipline. In reforming the financial regulation regime, adding new regulations to the old is therefore not the best way forward. Rather, priority should be given to reforming the paradigm of financial regulation by allowing more room for the subordinated market to discipline the regulators to take more prompt and rigorous corrective actions. ...|$|R
40|$|Academics, {{policymakers and}} bank {{supervisors}} have expressed considerable interest in using <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> and other market {{data in the}} surveillance of banking organizations, especially large and complex financial institutions. However, {{little research has been}} devoted to developing practical means of implementing such an approach for <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt.</b> This paper attempts to fill a portion of this gap. A major problem with using <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> spreads is that accurate prices of individual <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> issues are difficult to come by. The bond market is largely an over-the-counter market where dealer prices are proprietary. The approach used here is to evaluate a number of data sources, including price series from vendors and broker-dealers. Our results indicate that <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> spreads are most consistent across sources for the most liquid bond issues. We also find that the most liquid bonds are those that have a relatively large issuance size, have a relatively young age, have been issued by a relatively large banking organization, and are traded in a relatively robust overall bond market. Moreover, although there are substantial differences in spread levels for individual bonds across data sources, there is a high degree of concordance in rankings of banking organizations by their minimum spreads across issues. There is especially strong agreement about which large banking organizations are in the tails of the spread distribution at a given point in time. However, time series results indicate that movements of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> spreads at individual institutions are sensitive to the data source for bond prices, thus complicating interpretation of such movements. On balance, our results support and provide guidance for the use of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> spreads in supervisory monitoring.
