40|$|With {{significant}} decrease in the background noise in present day automobiles, liquid slosh noise from an automotive fuel tank is considered as a great irritant during acceleration and deceleration. All major international OEMs and their suppliers try to reduce <b>sloshing</b> <b>noise</b> by various design modifications in the fuel tank. However, most major activities reported in open literature are primarily based on performing various CAE and experimental studies in isolation. At the same time, noise generation and its propagation is a multiphysics phenomenon, where uid mechanics due to liquid sloshing affects structural behaviour of the fuel tank and its mountings which in turn affects noise generation and propagation. In the present study, a multiphysics approach to noise generation {{has been used to}} predict liquid <b>sloshing</b> <b>noise</b> from a rectangular tank. By taking Computational Fluid dynamics (CFD) data, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Boundary Element Method (BEM) simulation studies have been performed in a semi-coupled manner to predict noise. <b>Sloshing</b> <b>noise</b> generated due to uid interaction with structural walls is simulated using Vibro-acoustic model. An integrated model is developed to predict dynamic forces and vibration displacement on tank walls due to dynamic pressure loading on tank walls. Noise radiated from tank walls is modelled by Harmonic Boundary Element Method and transient Finite Element method. Experimental and numerical studies have been performed to understand the mechanics of <b>sloshing</b> <b>noise</b> generation. Images from high speed video camera and noise measurement data have been used to compare numerical result...|$|E
40|$|Liquid <b>sloshing</b> <b>noise</b> from an {{automotive}} fuel tank {{is becoming increasingly}} important during frequent accelerating/decelerating driving conditions. It is becoming more apparent due to significant decrease in other noise sources in a vehicle, particularly in hybrid vehicles. As a step toward understanding the dynamics of liquid sloshing and noise generation mechanism, an experimental study was performed in a partially filled rectangular tank. A systematic study was performed to understand the effects of critical parameters like fill level and acceleration/deceleration magnitude. Response parameters like dynamic pressure, dynamic force, dynamic acceleration and sound pressure levels along with high speed video images were recorded. The proposed experimental setup was able to demonstrate major events leading to <b>sloshing</b> <b>noise</b> generation. These events in the sloshing mechanism have been analysed from the dynamic sensor data and correlated with high speed video images...|$|E
