The purposive sample consisted of 30 <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> farming operations in Kansas and Missouri with revenue less than 250, 000 per annum. Data analysis was 3 -tiered and involved use of horizontalization, thematic clustering, and synthesis. Using the Van Kaam method of data analysis, 4 themes emerged: (a) <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> farmers have a family-oriented farming experience with complex factors that lead to the reliance on fellow farmers for information and support; (b) <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> farmers rely on fellow farmers for advice and support as well as the use of established procedures in their farming operations; (c) while <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> farmers see the value in ICT in farming, many view it as either impractical or non-applicable for their own operations; and (d) <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> farmers recognized that ICT has a positive impact on farms productivity, income, and growth. However, some <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> farmers were reluctant to adopt ICT due to expenditure, location, and farm size concerns.

5|$|British rule {{came at a}} {{price for}} many {{ordinary}} {{people as well as}} traders. The Shetlanders' nautical skills were sought by the Royal Navy: some 3,000 served during the Napoleonic Wars from 1800 to 1815 and press gangs were rife.

By the late 19th century 90% of all Shetland was owned by just 32 people, and between 1861 and 1881 more than 8,000 Shetlanders emigrated. With the passing of the Crofters' Act in 1886 the Liberal prime minister William Gladstone emancipated crofters from the rule of the landlords.

5|$|In the Greco-Roman {{world of}} Classical antiquity, Roman {{agriculture}} {{was built on}} techniques originally pioneered by the Sumerians, transmitted to them by subsequent cultures, with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export. The Romans {{laid the groundwork for}} the manorial economic system, involving serfdom, which flourished in the Middle Ages. The farm sizes in Rome can be divided into three categories. <b>Small</b> <b>farms</b> were from 18-88 iugera (one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre). Medium-sized farms were from 80-500 iugera (singular iugerum). Large estates (called latifundia) were over 500 iugera. The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers; tenant farming or sharecropping in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm’s produce; and situations in which a farm was leased to a tenant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{many of the}} large country estates in the area, with their mansions and {{associated}} grounds and outbuildings, were split up into smaller plots of land, attracting haphazard housing development and <b>small</b> <b>farms.</b> By {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914 Crawley had grown into a small but prosperous town, serving a wide rural area and those passing through on the A23 London–Brighton road. Three-quarters of the population had piped water supplies, all businesses and homes had electricity, and piped gas and street lighting had been in place for 50years. An airfield was opened in 1930 on land near the racecourse. This was a private concern until the Second World War when it was claimed by the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{tensions}} in the western and southwestern states was the influx of Mexicans to the U.S. following the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Many Mexicans also smoked marijuana to relax after working in the fields. It was also seen as a cheaper alternative to alcohol, due to Prohibition (which went into effect nationally in 1920). Later in the 1920s, negative tensions grew between the <b>small</b> <b>farms</b> and the large farms that used cheaper Mexican labor. Shortly afterwards, the Great Depression came which increased tensions as jobs and resources became more scarce. Because of that, {{the passage of the}} initial laws is often described as a product of racism, yet use of hashish by near eastern immigrants was also cited, as well as the misuse of pharmaceutical hemp, and the laws conformed with other legislation that was being passed around the country. Mexico itself had passed prohibition in 1925, following the International Opium Convention (see below).|$|E
40|$|The {{repetition}} of droughts in France {{has led to}} a growing demand for irrigation water and consequently to an increase in requests for the construction of <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> dams. Although such dams are small, their accumulation in a basin affects river flows, because the water collected in these <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> dams is used for irrigation and thus does not contribute to river flow. In order to gain more insight into their impact on the annual and monthly discharges, especially during dry years, a <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> dam model was built and connected to a hydrometeorological model. Several scenarios with different volume capacities, filling catchment sizes and filling periods were tested for such dams. The results were analysed in a small basin in western France, where the pressure for building such dams is high, and then extended to the entire country. It was found that, due to the hydrometeorological conditions (mainly low precipitation compared to other regions in France), the development of <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> dams in north-western France would result in greater decreases in river flows and less efficient filling of <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> dams than in other regions. Therefore, such dams might not be as efficient as expected in supplying water to farmers when needed. Moreover, the ability to fill <b>small</b> <b>farm</b> dams is projected to decrease in a context of climate change, despite the uncertainty on the evolution of precipitation, thus worsening the situation...|$|R
