Though he nearly dies, Frank still covers for Delia and they try to repair their marriage. In November 1976, Delia shoves Frank's lover, Jill Coleridge (Nancy Addison), falling over Little John's tricycle, and she sustains some injuries, being shoved {{in the same manner}} as <b>she</b> <b>shoved</b> Frank, which angers the Ryan family towards her, and imperils her chances of getting custody of her son. However, when Delia begins an affair with Dr. Roger Coleridge (Ron Hale), Jill's brother, Frank divorces her in February 1977. Delia then turns to her first love, Patrick (Malcolm Groome) and seduces him. After Delia announces her pregnancy, Pat proposes marriage. Delia {{secretly}} miscarriages on April 1, 1977, but keeps quiet as she marries Pat several weeks later. During the marriage, Delia resorts to extremes to keep Patrick's attention including faking a miscarriage and a mental breakdowns. When Pat turns to drugs and pushes her down the stairs during a confrontation, Delia is left temporarily blind; though she recovers, Delia continues to fake blindness. During a cruise in April 1978, Pat finds out that Delia was faking the blindness. When they return to Riverside, he also finds out from Roger and Faith all of Delia's schemes over the past year. The Ryan family then confront Delia on all her crimes, then decide to detach from her behavior. [...] Delia goes into therapy, then agrees to having the marriage annulled in September 1978. Roger convinces Delia that she is fine just the way she is. [...] He helps Delia establish her independence. They marry in October 1978. Delia (Edwards) becomes heavily involved in the stock market and her investments begin to pay off. However, when Roger suspects her of cheating with her stock broker, her divorces her. Delia later opens her own restaurant, The Crystal Palace [...] and begins dating Ryan family cousin, Barry (Richard Backus). When Delia finds out Barry has been cheating on her, she runs him over and frames her former sister-in-law, Faith Coleridge (Karen Morris-Gowdy) for the crime. Due to lack of finances, Delia loses her business to mob boss, Joe Novak (Roscoe Born); however she is forced to shut The Palace down in 1982. Delia leaves Riverside in November 1983 after getting a job offer. In actuality, Frank (Geoff Pierson) sets up the job with the help of Rae Woodard so he can get custody of Little John.

60|$|With {{thumb and}} {{forefinger}} she swept the dripping suds first from one arm and then from the other. He put his arms round her massive waist and kissed her wet steamy lips. The tears welled into her eyes--not so much from strength of feeling as from the weakness of chronic overwork. <b>She</b> <b>shoved</b> him away from her, but not before he {{caught a glimpse of}} her moist eyes.|$|E
60|$|It {{was at this}} {{juncture}} that a loud knock sounded upon {{the door of the}} outer room. Springing from the couch, the girl seized the man by the arm and dragged him after her to the wall close by the head of the couch. Here she drew back one of the hangings, revealing a little niche behind, into which <b>she</b> <b>shoved</b> the Englishman and dropped the hangings before him, effectually hiding him from observation from the rooms beyond.|$|E

60|$|A {{relation}} {{between mother and}} child to-day is practically never parental. It is personal--which means, it is critical and deliberate, and adult in provocation. The mother, in her new rôle of idealist and life-manager never, practically for one single moment, gives her child the unthinking response from the deep dynamic centers. No, she gives it {{what is good for}} it. <b>She</b> <b>shoves</b> milk in its mouth as the clock strikes, <b>she</b> <b>shoves</b> it to sleep when the milk is swallowed, and <b>she</b> <b>shoves</b> it ideally through baths and massage, promenades and practice, till the little organism develops like a mushroom to stand on its own feet. Then she continues her ideal shoving of it through all the stages of an ideal up-bringing, she loves it as a chemist loves his test-tubes in which he analyzes his salts. The poor little object is his mother's ideal. But of her head she dictates his providential days, and by the force of her deliberate mentally-directed love-will she pushes him up into boyhood. The poor little devil never knows one moment when he is not encompassed by the beautiful, benevolent, idealistic, Botticelli-pure, and finally obscene love-will of the mother. Never, never one mouthful does he drink of the milk of human kindness: always the sterilized milk of human benevolence. There is no mother's milk to-day, save in tigers' udders, and in the udders of sea-whales. Our children drink a decoction of ideal love, at the breast.|$|R

After Lily rejects him, {{he attempts to}} attack her, but <b>she</b> <b>shoves</b> {{him to the ground}} and berates him, mocking his ugliness and naivety. She reveals that she knows exactly what she is, and that she knows her resurrection made her immortal. Lily promises that she will never serve another man again, and instead swears that they will kneel to her. She offers the Creature to overthrow mankind with her, but he is terrified and refuses.|$|R

She was by no means an uncomely maiden, with pleasant Scotch features, and a quiet intelligence of aspect, gleaming into a smile when spoken to; much tanned with all kinds of weather, and, though slender, yet so agile and muscular that it was no shame for a man to let himself be rowed by her.|$|E

This translates into more offspring for her. Once <b>she</b> <b>shoves</b> the egg sac down his throat, Flash will give birth to thousands of Ero's children, but die in the process.|$|R
50|$|Justin {{tries to}} meet up with her as soon as he acquires the weed, but she convinces him to meet at the school the next day instead. He slips it into Naomi's purse, and she tries to give him money. Justin refuses, insisting that the weed is a gift to her to prove just how much he cares about her. Knowing that she can't {{properly}} bust him without the sealing the deal with a monetary transaction, <b>she</b> <b>shoves</b> it into Justin's hands just as the teacher comes into the room-keeping him from returning it to Naomi and Justin kisses her. ("The Money").|$|R
60|$|Then it {{was that}} there came into my head {{the first of the}} mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives. If six men were left by Silver, it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship; and since only six were left, it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance. It {{occurred}} to me at once to go ashore. In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the fore-sheets of the nearest boat, and almost at the same moment <b>she</b> <b>shoved</b> off.|$|E
60|$|The {{shivering}} slowly lessened {{and at last}} ceased, {{but this}} seemed to make Grizel no less unhappy. To her vehement attempt to draw her mother's attention she got no response; the Painted Lady was hearkening intently for some sound other than Grizel's voice, and only once did she look at her child. Then it was with cruel, ugly eyes, {{and at the same}} moment <b>she</b> <b>shoved</b> Grizel aside so viciously that it was almost a blow. Grizel sat down sorrowfully beside her doll, like one aware that she could do no more, and her mother at once forgot her. What was she listening for so eagerly? Was it for the gallop of a horse? Tommy strained his ears.|$|E
60|$|They trailed up-stairs, {{after he}} had turned out the lights and twice tested {{the front door to}} make sure it was fast. While they talked they were {{preparing}} for bed. Carol still sought to maintain privacy by undressing behind the screen of the closet door. Kennicott was not so reticent. Tonight, as every night, she was irritated by having to push the old plush chair out of the way before she could open the closet door. Every time she opened the door <b>she</b> <b>shoved</b> the chair. Ten times an hour. But Kennicott liked to have the chair in the room, and there was no place for it except in front of the closet.|$|E

She yells at him at first, but then {{in a moment of}} anger, <b>she</b> <b>shoves</b> him and he falls down a flight of stairs. Dawn has a meeting with Principal Wood and Buffy about the incident and informs them that the jock just tripped and fell down the stairs. Buffy realizes though that Dawn may have been motivated by her love for R.J. and actually pushed O'Donnell down the stairs.|$|R

She turned over {{and went to sleep}} again, and at five when she woke up she could distinctly ’ear Bill working ’is ’ardest. Then she went to the winder and nearly dropped as she saw Bill in his shirt and trousers digging away like mad.

60|$|He ground {{his soul}} in uneasiness and fear. But she {{rose to a}} real {{outburst}} of house-work, turning him away as <b>she</b> <b>shoved</b> the furniture aside to her broom. He stood hanging miserable near. He wanted her back. Dread, and desire for her to stay with him, and shame at his own dependence on her drove him to anger. He began to lose his head. The wonder was going to pass away again. All the love, the magnificent new order {{was going to be}} lost, she would forfeit it all for the outside things. She would admit the outside world again, she would throw away the living fruit for the ostensible rind. He began to hate this in her. Driven by fear of her departure into a state of helplessness, almost of imbecility, he wandered about the house.|$|E
60|$|The wild {{note of the}} hound manifestly stirred Bo to irrepressible action. Snatching up Dale's lighter rifle, <b>she</b> <b>shoved</b> it {{into her}} saddle-sheath, and, leaping on the mustang, she ran him over brush and brook, {{straight}} down the park toward the place Pedro was climbing. For an instant Helen stood amazed beyond speech. When Bo sailed over a big log, like a steeple-chaser, then Helen answered to further unconsidered impulse by frantically getting her saddle fastened. Without coat or hat she mounted. The nervous horse bolted almost before she got into the saddle. A strange, trenchant trembling coursed through all her veins. She wanted to scream for Bo to wait. Bo was out of sight, but the deep, muddy tracks in wet places and the path through the long grass afforded Helen an easy trail to follow. In fact, her horse needed no guiding. He ran {{in and out of}} the straggling spruces along the edge of the park, and suddenly wheeled around a corner of trees to come upon the gray mustang standing still. Bo was looking up and listening.|$|E

She bites and scratches him. He hits her with a chair, he didn’t mean it and tries to apologize but <b>she</b> <b>shoves</b> him away. He falls backward off the tallest tower in Kabul screaming, falls into the street and gets run over by Qassim's truck.|$|R

6000|$|... 'It {{got to be}} Sunday all the time. Seven Sundays in the week--to us, anyway. We hadn't {{anything}} to do, and time hung heavy. Seven Sundays, {{and all of them}} broken up at one time or another, in the day or in the night, by a few hours of the awful storm of fire and thunder and iron. At first we used to shin for the holes a good deal faster than we did afterwards. The first time, I forgot the children, and Maria fetched them both along. When she was all safe in the cave she fainted. Two or three weeks afterwards, when she was running for the holes, one morning, through a shell-shower, a big shell burst near her, and covered her all over with dirt, and a piece of the iron carried away her game-bag of false hair from the back of her head. Well, she stopped to get that game-bag before <b>she</b> <b>shoved</b> along again! Was getting used to things already, you see. We all got so that we could tell a good deal about shells; and after that we didn't always go under shelter if it was a light shower. Us men would loaf around and talk; and a man would say, 'There she goes!' and name the kind of shell it was from the sound of it, and go on talking--if there wasn't any danger from it. If a shell was bursting close over us, we stopped talking and stood still;--uncomfortable, yes, but it wasn't safe to move. When it let go, we went on talking again, if nobody hurt--maybe saying, 'That was a ripper!' or some such commonplace comment before we resumed; or, maybe, we would see a shell poising itself away high in the air overhead. In that case, every fellow just whipped out a sudden, 'See you again, gents!' and shoved. Often and often I saw gangs of ladies promenading the streets, looking as cheerful as you please, and keeping an eye canted up watching the shells; and I've seen them stop still when they were uncertain about what a shell was going to do, and wait and make certain; and after that they sa'ntered along again, or lit out for shelter, according to the verdict. Streets in some towns have a litter of pieces of paper, and odds and ends {{of one sort or another}} lying around. Ours hadn't; they had IRON litter. Sometimes a man would gather up all the iron fragments and unbursted shells in his neighborhood, and pile them into a kind of monument in his front yard--a ton of it, sometimes. No glass left; glass couldn't stand such a bombardment; it was all shivered out. Windows of the houses vacant--looked like eye-holes in a skull. WHOLE panes were as scarce as news.|$|E

That's a d--d underhand thing to do, by the way--coming round to sound a fellow upon the woman {{you are going to}} marry. You deserve {{anything}} you get. Then of course you rush and tell her, and she takes care to make it pleasant for the poor spiteful wretch the first time he calls. I will do you the justice to say, however, that you don't seem to have told Madame de Cintre; or if you have she's uncommonly magnanimous. She was very nice; she was tremendously polite. She and Lizzie sat on the sofa, pressing each other's hands and calling each other chere belle, and Madame de Cintre sent me with every third word a magnificent smile, as if to give me to understand that I too was a handsome dear. She quite made up for past neglect, I assure you; she was very pleasant and sociable. Only in an evil hour it came into her head to say that she must present us to her mother--her mother wished to know your friends. I didn't want to know her mother, and I was on the point of telling Lizzie to go in alone and let me wait for her outside. But Lizzie, with her usual infernal ingenuity, guessed my purpose and reduced me by a glance of her eye. So they marched off arm in arm, and I followed as I could. We found the old lady in her arm-chair, twiddling her aristocratic thumbs. She looked at Lizzie from head to foot; but at that game Lizzie, to do her justice, was a match for her. My wife told her we were great friends of Mr. Newman. The marquise started a moment, and then said, 'Oh, Mr. Newman! My daughter has made up her mind to marry a Mr. Newman.' Then Madame de Cintre began to fondle Lizzie again, and said it was this dear lady that had planned the match and brought them together. 'Oh, 'tis you I have to thank for my American son-in-law,' the old lady said to Mrs. Tristram. 'It was a very clever thought of yours. Be sure of my gratitude.' And then she began to look at me and presently said, 'Pray, are you engaged in some species of manufacture?' I wanted to say that I manufactured broom-sticks for old witches to ride on, but Lizzie got in ahead of me. 'My husband, Madame la Marquise,' she said, 'belongs to that unfortunate class of persons who have no profession and no business, and do very little good in the world.' To get her poke at the old woman she didn't care where <b>she</b> <b>shoved</b> me. 'Dear me,' said the marquise, 'we all have our duties.' 'I am sorry mine compel me to take leave of you,' said Lizzie. And we bundled out again. But you have a mother-in-law, in all the force of the term." ...|$|E

When he turns around to attack her again, Yulia shoots him in the head, causing his brains to be splattered on the wall.
