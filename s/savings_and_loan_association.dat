5|$|The Keating Five scandal was {{prompted}} by the activities of one particular savings and loan: Lincoln <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>Association</b> of Irvine, California. Lincoln's chairman was Charles Keating, who ultimately served {{five years in prison}} for his corrupt mismanagement of Lincoln. In the four years after Keating's American Continental Corporation (ACC) had purchased Lincoln in 1984, Lincoln's assets had increased from $1.1 billion to $5.5 billion.|$|E

The five senators – Alan Cranston (Democrat of California), Dennis DeConcini (Democrat of Arizona), John Glenn (Democrat of Ohio), John McCain (Republican of Arizona), and Donald W. Riegle, Jr. (Democrat of Michigan) – were accused of improperly intervening in 1987 on behalf of Charles H. Keating, Jr., Chairman of the Lincoln <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>Association,</b> which was the target of a regulatory investigation by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB).

25|$|In 1956, Mardian, already {{active in}} the Republican Party, was {{appointed}} to a vacant seat on the Pasadena School Board. He was elected in 1957 but resigned shortly afterwards through pressure of work. From 1962, Mardian left his law practice to become {{vice president and chief}} legal officer of a <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> <b>association.</b> In the 1964 presidential election he managed the Goldwater campaign in four western states; although Goldwater was unsuccessful, his campaigning ability impressed Richard Nixon and he was appointed to the same position in Nixon's 1968 campaign.

25|$|He {{attended}} Gilman School in Baltimore, {{and then}} went to Harvard University, graduating in 1968 with a degree in Dutch art history. During his time at Gilman, Symington met Thomas Caplan, who would later introduce him to Bill Clinton during college. At 19 years old, Symington rescued Clinton from nearly drowning during a trip to Hyannis Port, Massachusetts near the Kennedy compound. While studying at Harvard, Symington discovered the works of Nobel Prize winner Friedrich Hayek, an economist, social theorist and political philosopher who promoted limited government and free markets. Hayek's work would serve as an influence for Symington's political beliefs in regards to fiscal and taxation policy as Governor. Symington was also a supporter of Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election against Lyndon B. Johnson. Beginning in 1967, he served in the United States Air Force during the Vietnam War, and was stationed at Luke Air Force Base near Glendale, Arizona. In 1971, he was awarded the Bronze Star for meritorious service, before being honorably discharged. He remained in Arizona and became involved in real estate development, founding his own company, The Symington Company, in 1976. In 1983, he was appointed to Southwest <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>Association</b> board of directors which was based in Salt Lake City, Utah.|$|E

500|$|John McCain's upward {{political}} trajectory was jolted when {{he became}} enmeshed in the Keating Five scandal, a highly visible part of the Savings and Loan crisis of the 1980s. Charles Keating Jr.'s Lincoln <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>Association,</b> a subsidiary of his American Continental Corporation, was insolvent {{as a result of}} some bad loans. In order to overcome its debt, Lincoln violated [...] "direct investment" [...] rules by directing accounts by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation into commercial real estate ventures.

500|$|In 1984, American Continental Corporation bought Lincoln <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>Association</b> {{for just}} over $50 million. Up {{through the early}} 1980s, Lincoln had been a conservatively-run enterprise, with almost half its assets in home loans and {{only a quarter of}} its assets {{considered}} at risk. It made slow growth at best, and had shown a loss for several years until it made a profit of a few million dollars in 1983. Once he took over, Keating fired the existing management. Savings and loan associations had been deregulated in the early 1980s, allowing them to make high-risk investments with their depositors' money, a change of which Keating and other savings and loan operators took advantage. When Keating later was asked why he got into savings and loans, he said, [...] "I know the business inside out, and I always felt that an S & L, if they'd relax the rules, was the biggest moneymaker in the world." ...|$|E

500|$|McCain became {{embroiled in}} a scandal during the 1980s, as one of five United States {{senators}} comprising the so-called Keating Five. Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in lawful political contributions from Charles Keating Jr. and his associates at Lincoln <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>Association,</b> along with trips on Keating's jets that McCain belatedly repaid, in 1989. In 1987, McCain {{was one of the}} five senators whom Keating contacted in order to prevent the government's seizure of Lincoln, and McCain met twice with federal regulators to discuss the government's investigation of Lincoln. In 1999, McCain said: [...] "The appearance of it was wrong. It's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators, because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence. And it was the wrong thing to do." [...] In the end, McCain was cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee of acting improperly or violating any law or Senate rule, but was mildly rebuked for exercising [...] "poor judgment". In his 1992 re-election bid, the Keating Five affair was not a major issue, and he won handily, gaining 56percent of the vote to defeat Democratic community and civil rights activist Claire Sargent and independent former governor, Evan Mecham.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the economy}} {{recovered}} in 1983, the residual effects of high inflation and {{high interest rates}} {{had a profound impact}} on the <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> industry. <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> <b>associations</b> were limited by interest rate ceilings. As a result of rising interest rates, many <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> institutions experienced frequent account withdrawals, as depositors moved their money to higher-earning accounts offered by commercial banks. The already struggling <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> industry posted large losses in 1981 and 1982.
