5|$|At {{the start}} of the 200708 season, she made her senior debut for the New South Wales Breakers in the Australian {{domestic}} one-day league. She was used as a specialist batsman in the top-order, as Leonie Coleman, a wicket-keeper in the Australian squad, also played for New South Wales. She made her debut against South Australia and was unsuccessful to begin with, scoring only 24 runs in her first five innings. After one month at senior level, she broke through with a match-winning performance in her sixth senior game. After Queensland had made 170, Healy came in with the score at 5/99 after 32 overs, with 18 overs remaining. <b>She</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> run rate, scoring 41 not out from 50 balls, with eight fours, shepherding the tail-enders and guiding her state to a two-wicket win with 17 balls to spare.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her deputy leadership role, Lamont was appointed Chief of Staff with special responsibility for Equalities. While in that post she gave her support to Scottish Government plans to introduce a Bill outlawing forced marriage, which was announced in September 2010. In February 2011, she criticised Scottish Conservative MSP and Justice Committee Convener, Bill Aitken after the Sunday Herald quoted him making a controversial statement about a rape victim, and later welcomed his subsequent resignation. As Gray's deputy Lamont also represented Labour at First Minister's Questions in his absence. At a session of First Minister's Questions in October 2009, <b>she</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> issue of the Scottish Futures Trust with Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, asking whether the public body planned to spend any money on improving school infrastructure before the 2011 election.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in the scientific literature in 1928 as Collybia cirrhata var. cookei by the Italian mycologist Giacomo Bresadola. In a 1935 publication, Jean D. Arnold reported a series of cultural studies with monokaryon isolates (hypha having only a single haploid nucleus) of several Collybia species to determine their mating type. All attempts to produce hybrids between C.cirrhata var. cookei and C.cirrata or mycelial fusions between the two species failed. This sexual incompatibility indicated that the two taxa were separate species, and <b>she</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> taxon from varietal to specific status, calling it Collybia cookei. The species has also been called Microcollybia cookei in a 1979 publication by Joanne Lennox, but the genus Microcollybia has since been folded into Collybia. Marcel Bon and Régis Courtecuisse considered the species a variety of Collybia tuberosa in a 1988 publication. A 2001 molecular analysis based on the ribosomal DNA sequences confirmed that C.cookei is phylogenetically related to C.tuberosa and C.cirrhata, and that the three species form a monophyletic group that comprise the genus Collybia.|$|E

25|$|At the European Indoor Championships in Madrid, Spain Isinbayeva {{won gold}} {{with a new}} indoor world record of 4.90m. In July 2005, Isinbayeva broke the world record four times over three {{separate}} meetings. First in Lausanne, Switzerland, she added an extra centimetre to her own mark clearing 4.93m. It was the 14th world record of Isinbayeva's career coming just three months after she broke her own indoor mark (4.89m) in Lievin. Eleven days later, in Madrid, Spain, she added an additional 2cm to clear 4.95m. In Crystal Palace, London on 22 July, after improving the record to 4.96m, <b>she</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> bar to 5.00m.

25|$|On 4 October 1941, Suur Tõll was {{transferred}} to the Soviet Navy and armed with four 45mm anti-aircraft guns. Two weeks later, her Estonian crew was replaced by Soviet Navy sailors and on 11 November she was given back her old name, Volynets. However, it was not until 25 January 1942 that <b>she</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> naval ensign. At the same time, her armament was increased with two 76mm anti-aircraft guns and later she received two more guns of the same type. During the Siege of Leningrad and the resulting shortage of coal, Volynets mostly remained in the port as a stationary anti-aircraft battery. She had also struck naval mines twice, first on 24 November 1942 when three small mines caused minor damage to her bow and then again in January 1945.|$|E

25|$|The floods come in {{the wake}} of {{government}} cuts to flood protection, which has seen 294 flood defence schemes cut which had indicative funding in place in 2010, with major schemes in Leeds, Thirsk, Ipswich, Fleetwood and Croston, Lancashire not built. The UK government announced on 30 November that £120million of new funding would be released to speed up building of 50 flood defences by Defra, which would prioritise schemes in Leeds city centre, Sheffield, Exeter, Derby and Ipswich. Anne McIntosh MP for Thirsk and Malton and vice-president of the Association of Drainage Authorities questioned whether the government had prioritised the right schemes in their announced package of new funding. Noting that the Pitt Review of the UK floods of 2007 demanded that Government prove rivers are being dredged regularly, <b>she</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> issue of whether this could be maintained as the maintenance spend of the Environment Agency was being cut.|$|E
25|$|In early 2011, Christy Clark, former Deputy Premier, {{would become}} {{leader of the}} Liberal Party.

Among her early accomplishments <b>she</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> minimum wage, created the new holiday of Family Day and pushed the development of BC's liquified natural gas. In the 2013 election, the Liberals lagged behind the NDP with a double-digit gap in the polls, but were able to come to a surprise victory on election night with a majority, making Clark the first elected female premier in BC history. While Clark lost her seat to NDP candidate David Eby, she later won a by-election in the riding of Westside-Kelowna. Her government would go on to balance the budget, implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines.|$|E
25|$|In {{the time}} of Richard's son, Walter Leveson (1551–1602), the family and its estates got into serious difficulties. Walter became {{involved}} in piracy against allied shipping in the North Sea. He suffered a series of huge fines and several spells in the Fleet Prison, as well as developing a persecutory delusion. By {{the time of}} his death, he was massively in debt. Richard, a noted admiral, was well aware of the desperate situation even before he inherited it. However, he had no time to improve matters, as he died without issue less than two years later, leaving still further massive debts, as he was accused of stealing the contents of a captured carrack. It was left to a cousin, John Leveson of Halling, Kent, to resolve the issue as trustee of the estate. He died in 1610, but his wife Christian took up the struggle. She improved the lodge, and when the Crown seized Lilleshall in 1616, <b>she</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> money to lease it back. In 1623 she finally paid off all the debts. The abbey and manor passed later that year to another Sir Richard Leveson, John and Christian's son. A notable Cavalier in the English Civil War, in 1643 he fortified the site and installed a garrison of 160 men. Parliamentary forces besieged and bombarded the abbey. Before the garrison surrendered, the towers, lady chapel, and north transept were destroyed. After Sir Richard's death in 1661, the manor passed to his widow, Katherine, for life and then to his great nephew, William Leveson-Gower. Thereafter it became a seat of the Leveson-Gower family.|$|E

500|$|Labour campaigned {{to secure}} a fourth {{consecutive}} term in office and to restore support lost since 1997, while the Conservative Party sought to gain a dominant position in British politics after losses in the 1990s, and to replace Labour as the governing party. The Liberal Democrats hoped to make gains from both sides, and possibly hold {{the balance of power}} in a hung parliament. After the televised debates between the three leaders–the first of their type during an election campaign in the United Kingdom–their poll ratings had risen to the point where many considered the possibility of a Liberal Democrat role in Government. While Cameron and Clegg were generally well received by the viewers of the three debates, Brown's performance was considered to have been less successful. Brown's image was further harmed when he privately described Gillian Duffy, a 65-year-old pensioner, as a [...] "bigoted woman" [...] after <b>she</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> issue of benefits and immigration with him during a campaign trip to Rochdale, Greater Manchester.
