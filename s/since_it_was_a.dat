25|$|In 1879, O'Neill left home, {{heading for}} Arizona Territory. In 1880, he settled in Tombstone, Arizona. During {{this time the}} Earp Brothers, the city policemen, and the Clanton-McLaury Gang, a group of rustlers and murderers, were at war with each other. O'Neill joined the Tombstone Epitaph; <b>since</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pro-Earp newspaper, he {{frequently}} talked with, and became a casual acquaintance of, the Earps.

25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{widely held}} {{belief in the}} United States that a {{shipbuilding}} boom would follow the end of hostilities, the USSB declined to cancel many of its wartime shipbuilding contracts {{at the end of}} the war.

In 1920 however, the USSB cancelled a contract for an additional 25 ships, prompting the company to launch a $17 million claim against the government for lost anticipated profits, later reduced to a $9 million claim.|$|E
25|$|On 12 November 2007, a 13-ft long {{reticulated}} python {{was found}} in a ventilator inside the pygmy hippopotamus enclosure in the zoo. According to the zoo officials, the rescued python could have escaped from its enclosure, when it was young, 4 to 5 years ago. When the workers tried to take the reptile, it bit one of the animal keepers, but <b>since</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> non-poisonous one, the animal keeper was not harmed fatally and was provided treatment for the injury. The reptile was feeding on small mammals, roaming freely inside the zoo, which helped it survive without any problem.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the members of}} the court, two auxiliary figures existed that collaborated with the Holy Office: the familiares and the comissarios (commissioners). Familiares were lay collaborators of the Inquisition, who had to be permanently at the service of the Holy Office. To become a familiar was considered an honour, <b>since</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> public recognition of limpieza de sangre — Old Christian status — and brought with it certain additional privileges. Although many nobles held the position, most of the familiares came from the ranks of commoners. The commissioners, on the other hand, were members of the religious orders who collaborated occasionally with the Holy Office.|$|E
25|$|DATAR {{was similar}} in concept to Benjamin's display. The {{trackball}} used four disks {{to pick up}} motion, two each for the X and Y directions. Several rollers provided mechanical support. When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball. By counting the pulses, the physical movement of the ball could be determined. A digital computer calculated the tracks and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using pulse-code modulation radio signals. This trackball used a standard Canadian five-pin bowling ball. It was not patented, <b>since</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> secret military project.|$|E
25|$|PennDOT {{also tried}} {{acquiring}} a local pizza shop, Pizza Dude, {{for the southern}} end of the new right-of-way, but the owner didn't want to sell the property since it would potentially lose business from the college students as well as no other suitable property nearby that would adequately replace his old building, a former Burger Chef location. PennDOT and the owner agreed to a compromise in which the owner got to stay on his property, but had to tear down the front portion of the building (which, for the time being, eliminated seating at the building) so that the right-of-way would have enough clearance from the building. The owner also gave up a portion of his parking lot, but the building itself would be protected by a grandfather clause requiring a certain length between a road and a building <b>since</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pre-existing building. In 2010, Pizza Dude moved on its own to downtown Beaver Falls, and the building is currently vacant.|$|E

25|$|It {{is certain}} that John Paul I would not have {{reversed}} Paul VI's teaching, namely on contraception, <b>since</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> question of sexual ethics and Church doctrine, rather than one of personal opinion. Nevertheless, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgment in Humanae vitae as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did. Luciani had mixed feelings in regards to the traditional stance on contraception. In 1968, as Bishop of Vittorio Veneto, he submitted a report to his predecessor as the Patriarch of Venice, Giovanni Urbani, that argued that the contraceptive pill should be permitted. It was agreed on by fellow Veneto bishops and was later submitted to Pope Paul VI. When Humanae vitae was released, Luciani defended that document. But he seemed to contradict that defence in a letter he wrote to his diocese four days after the release of the encyclical. In May 1978, Cardinal Luciani was invited to speak at a Milanese conference to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the encyclical. He refused to speak at the event or even attend it.|$|E
25|$|After un-assembled {{planes were}} strafed {{on the ground}} on May 30 at Ekron {{airfield}} the fighters were moved to makeshift strip located around the current Herzliya Airport. The airfield was used {{as it was a}} bit back from the front-lines, and was clandestine <b>since</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> purpose built strip, that was constructed after the beginning of hostilities, in between the orange orchards around Herzliya, and didn't appear on published maps. The Israeli Air Force scored its first aerial victories on June 3 when Modi Alon, flying Avia D.112, shot down two Egyptian Air Force DC-3s which had just bombed Tel Aviv. The first dogfight against enemy fighters took place a few days later, on June 8, when Gideon Lichtaman shot down an Egyptian Spitfire. During these initial operations, the squadron operated with a few planes versus almost complete Arab theater Air supremacy and the airplanes were parked dispersed between the orange trees. The fighters were moved in October to Hatzor Airbase from the Herzliya strip in due to its unsuitability in rainy conditions, probable loss of clandestine status, moving front lines which made former British bases safe for use, and a shift in the balance of air superiority towards the Israelis.|$|E
25|$|Although {{reaction}} to the game's announcement satisfied the studio, they realized that its fast pace would make extensive use of the GamePad while muting the TV display's utility; players must focus on one screen while ignoring the other. The tiny monsters were problematic, since shooting them was unsatisfying. The issues were singled out by Ubisoft management at a Ubisoft Paris meeting, and the team decided to slow the game's pace. The enemies were changed from small monsters to zombies, since their movement is slower and they are easily identified as monsters. According to Jean-Karl Tupin-Bron, the team was sorry to realize that Killer Freaks would not work but delighted {{by the results of}} the transition. By September 2011, most of the Killer Freaks team had joined the zombie-game team. During the transition, the game's tone became more serious. The team tried to distinguish itself from other zombie games in the video-game market, making the GamePad its central feature. They were inspired by the 2007 film, I Am Legend, in which the protagonist is the only survivor left in a city and must be constantly on guard against zombies. ZombiU, the game's working title, became its official name <b>since</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> zombie game for Wii U.|$|E

25|$|Up {{until the}} 19th century, India was the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer, with Bengal and Mysore {{the centers of}} cotton production. In order to compete with India, Britain {{invested}} in labour-saving technical progress for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, while implementing protectionist policies such as bans and tariffs to restrict Indian imports. At the same time, the British East India Company's rule in India contributed to its deindustrialization, with the decline of native industry opening up a new market for British goods. British colonization forced open the large Indian market to British goods while restricting Indian imports to Britain, and raw cotton was imported from India without taxes or tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from Indian cotton and sold {{them back to the}} Indian market. India thus served as both an important supplier of raw goods such as cotton to British factories and a large captive market for British manufactured goods. In addition, the capital amassed from Bengal following its conquest after the Battle of Plassey in 1757 was used to invest in British industries such as textile manufacturing and greatly increase British wealth. Britain eventually surpassed India as the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer in the 19th century. British colonial rule has been blamed for the subsequently dismal state of British India's economy, with investment in Indian industries limited <b>since</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> colony.|$|E
