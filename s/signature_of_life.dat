40|$|The single-handedness of {{biological}} molecules has fascinated scientists and laymen alike since Pasteur's first painstaking {{separation of the}} enantiomorphic crystals of a tartrate salt more than 150 yr ago. More recently, a number of theoretical and experimental investigations have helped to delineate models for how one enantiomer might have come to dominate over the other from what presumably was a racemic prebiotic world. This article highlights mechanisms for enantioenrichment that include either chemical or physical processes, {{or a combination of}} both. The scientific driving force for this work arises from an interest in understanding the origin of life, because the homochirality {{of biological}} molecules is a <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>life...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Detecting {{microbial}} life in extraterrestrial locations {{is a goal}} {{of space}} exploration because of ecological and health concerns about possible contamination of other planets with earthly organisms, and vice versa. Previously we suggested a method for life detection {{based on the fact}} that living entities require a continual input of energy accessed through coupled oxidations and reductions (an electron transport chain). We demonstrated using earthly soils that the identification of extracted components of electron transport chains is useful for remote detection of a chemical <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> The instrument package developed used supercritical carbon dioxide for soil extraction, followed by chromatography or electrophoresis to separate extracted compounds, with final detection by voltammetry and tandem mass-spectrometry. Results Here we used Earth-derived soils to develop a related life detection system based on direct observation of a biological redox signature. We measured the ability of soil microbial communities to reduce artificial electron acceptors. Living organisms in pure culture and those naturally found in soil were shown to reduce 2, 3 -dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) and the tetrazolium dye 2, 3 -bis(2 -methoxy- 4 -nitro- 5 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium- 5 -carboxanilide inner salt (XTT). Uninoculated or sterilized controls did not reduce the dyes. A soil from Antarctica that was determined by chemical signature and DNA analysis to be sterile also did not reduce the dyes. Conclusion Observation of dye reduction, supplemented with extraction and identification of only a few specific signature redox-active biochemicals such as porphyrins or quinones, provides a simplified means to detect a <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in the soils of other planets or their moons. </p...|$|E

A novel miniaturized space polarimeter, called the SETH Cigar, is described {{which could be used}} to detect optical rotation as the homochiral <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> on other planets.

40|$|Abstract The high {{concentration}} of molecular oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere {{is arguably the most}} conspicuous and geologically important <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Earth’s early atmosphere lacked oxygen; accumulation began after the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria around 3. 0 – 2. 5 billion years ago (Gya). Concentrations of oxygen have since varied, first reaching near-modern values * 600 million years ago (Mya). These fluctuations have been hypothesized to constrain many biological patterns, among them the evolution of body size. Here, we review the state of knowledge relating oxygen availability to body size.

40|$|The {{biggest change}} to NCED {{structure}} {{resulting from the}} new SIP is {{the organization of the}} research into three “Integrated Projects” (IPs) : Desktop Watersheds, Stream Restoration, and Subsurface Architecture. The intellectual foundation of the IPs was provided by NCED research since its inception. The restructuring resulted in a major improvement in integration among disciplines and PIs, as documented below. Highlights of new collaborations include: (a) major efforts involving the Minnesota and Berkeley groups on coupling geomorphology and nutrient dynamics and on understanding variability of bedload grain size and ﬂ ux along channels and channel networks; (b) a growing effort between the Minnesota and Princeton groups on quantifying the spatial properties of deltaic channel networks and how these can be used to predict statistics of subsurface deposits; and (c) an accelerated transfer of theoretical results to practical application related to stream restoration. A major research highlight of this year was publication of a major review (and cover) article in the Jan. 26, 2006 issue of Nature, by Bill Dietrich and Taylor Perron. It would be hard to think of a clearer expression of NCED’s emphasis on combining biological and physical processes in shaping the Earth’s surface than this study of the topographic <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Examining a wide range of topographic indicators from the form of mountain ridges to river planforms, the article concludes that, beyond direct organic constructions such as termite mounds, there is no single unambiguous biotic indicator in the Earth’s topography. Rather, the topographic <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is to shift the frequency of biologically inﬂ uenced features such as meandering river channels. The question of how life imprints itself on topography is a fundamental research question but also has important implications for detection of life on other planets.

40|$|The astrobiological {{search for}} life, both extinct and extant, on other solar system bodies {{will take place}} via several planned lander {{missions}} to Mars Europa and Titan. The detection and identification of organic molecules that {{have been associated with}} life is a major technical challenge. Terrestrial life utilizes organic molecules, such as amino acids, as its basic building block. Amino acids can be synthesized by natural processes as is demonstrated by their detection in meteoritic material. In this process, the organic molecules are produced roughly in a even mixture of D and L forms. Biological process, however, can utilize almost uniquely one form or the other. In terrestrial biology, only the L-amino acids is common in biological processes.

40|$|Phosphate {{groups are}} found and used widely in {{biological}} chemistry. We have asked whether phosphate groups {{are likely to}} be important to the functioning of genetic molecules, including DNA and RNA. From observations made on synthetic analogs of DNA and RNA where the phosphates are replaced by nonanionic linking groups, we infer a set of rules that highlight the importance of the phosphodiester backbone for the proper functioning of DNA as a genetic molecule. The polyanionic backbone appears to give DNA the capability of replication following simple rules, and evolving. The polyanionic nature of the backbone appears to be critical to prevent the single strands from folding, permitting them to act as templates, guiding the interaction between two strands to form a duplex in a way that permits simple rules to guide the molecular recognition event, and buffering the sensitivity of its physicochemical properties to changes in sequence. We argue that the feature of a polyelectrolyte (polyanion or polycation) may be required for a “self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution. ” The polyelectrolyte structure therefore may be a universal <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> regardless of its genesis...|$|E

To address this concern, DNA in plasmid form was deposited onto different surfaces and exposed to UVC radiation. The surviving DNA was quantified via the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results demonstrate increased survivability of DNA attached to surfaces versus non-adsorbed DNA. The DNA was also tested for biological activity via transformation into the bacterium Acinetobacter sp. and assaying for antibiotic resistance conferred by genes encoded by the plasmid. The success of these methods to detect DNA and its gene products after UV exposure (254 nm, 3. 5 J/m(2) s) not only supports the use of the DNA molecule as a biosignature on mineral surfaces but also demonstrates that the DNA retained biological activity...|$|E

30|$|The {{detection}} {{of life in}} the universe is one of the driving forces behind astrobiology. A key component of a search for life in the universe is the identification of a signature unique to biological material. Many complex organic molecules exist in two mirror-symmetric forms, a dichotomy known as chirality. On Earth, biological molecules are typically found to be composed of only one of these two forms, e.g. “left-handed” amino acids or “right-handed” sugars. This preference, known as homochirality, is a potential <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> because non-biological processes lead to equal (racemic) mixtures of right-handed and left-handed chiral constituents. Multiple authors have suggested that homochirality may be a universal property of life (Cohen, 1995; Toxvaerd, 2009), as it may be a necessity for self-replication (Popa, 2004). It is already known that chirality is not a purely terrestrial phenomenon; excesses in left-handed amino acids have been found in meteorites (Cronin and Pizzarello, 1997; Pizzarello and Cronin, 2000). It has also been suggested that homochirality may explain circular polarization observed in comets (Rosenbush et al., 2007, 2008). Although the origin of homochirality is still not determined, there is evidence that it may be connected to early stages of the development of planetary systems, e.g. star forming regions, where homochiral organics may be produced by asymmetric photolysis and asymmetric photochemical synthesis of the organic molecules in the dust particles (e.g., Hough et al., 2001).|$|E

While DNA analysis has become central to work on natural gene exchange, forensic analyses, soil bioremediation, genetically modified organisms, exobiology, and palaeontology, fundamental questions about DNA resistance to degradation remain. This paper investigated on the presence of plant DNA in groundwater and artesian fountain (groundwater-fed) samples, which relates to the movement and persistence of DNA in the environment. The study was performed in the groundwater and in the fountains, which are considered as a traditional artesian drinking water in Geneva Champagne Basin. DNA from water samples was extracted, analysed and quantified. Plant gene sequences were detected using PCR amplification based on 18 S rRNA gene primers specific for eukaryotes. Physicochemical parameters of water samples including temperature, pH, conductivity, organic matter, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total organic carbon (TOC) were measured throughout the study. The results revealed that important quantities of plant DNA can be found in the groundwater. PCR amplification based on 18 S rDNA, cloning, RFLP analysis and sequencing demonstrated the presence of plant DNA including Vitis rupestris, Vitis berlandieri, Polygonum sp.

40|$|Abstract The {{detection}} of exolife {{is one of}} the goals of very ambitious future space missions that aim to take direct images of Earth-like planets. While associations of simple molecules present in the planet’s atmosphere (O 2,O 3,CO 2, etc.) have been identified as possible global biomarkers, this paper reviews the detectability of a <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> from the planet’s surface, i. e. the green vegetation. The vegetation reflectance has indeed a specific spectrum, with a sharp edge around 700 nm, known as the “Vegetation Red Edge ” (VRE). Moreover, vegetation covers a large surface of emerged lands, from tropical evergreen forest to shrub tundra. Thus, considering vegetation as a potential global biomarker is relevant. Earthshine allows us to observe the Earth as a distant planet, i. e. without spatial resolution. Since 2001, Earthshine observations have been used by several authors to test and quantify the detectability of the VRE in the Earth spectrum. The vegetation spectral signature is detected as a small “positive shift ” of a few percentage points above the continuum, starting at 700 nm. This signature appears in most spectra, and its strength is correlated with the Earth’s phase (visible land versus visible ocean). The observations show that detecting the VRE on Earth requires a photometric relative accuracy of 1 % or better. Detecting something equivalent on an Earth-like planet will therefore remain challenging, especially considering the possibility of mineral artifacts and the question of “red edge ” universality in the Universe...|$|E

However, recent studies of Earth's geochemical proxy record suggest that {{for all but the}} last ~ 500 million years, atmospheric O 2 would have been undetectable to a remote observer [...] and thus a potential false negative for life. During an extended period in Earth's middle history (2. 0 - 0. 7 billion years ago, Ga), O 2 was likely present but in low concentrations, with pO 2 estimates of ~ 0. 1 - 1 % of present day levels. Although O 2 has a weak spectral impact at these low abundances, O 3 in photochemical equilibrium with that O 2 would produce notable spectral features in the UV Hartley-Huggins band (~ 0. 25 um), with a weaker impact in the mid-IR band near 9. 7 um.

Additional goals of the mission would include the characterization of the surfaces and atmospheres of newfound planets, and looking for the chemical <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> [...] The two planned architectures were: ...|$|R

Habitable planets could be discovered elsewhere in the Universe, yet there are many hypothetical scenarios whereby the search for life on them could yield negative results. Scenarios for habitable worlds with no remotely detectable <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> include: planets that are habitable, but have no biosphere (Uninhabited Habitable Worlds); planets with life, but lacking any detectable surface <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> that <b>life</b> (laboratory examples are provided) and planets with life, where the concentration of atmospheric gases produced or removed by biota are impossible to disentangle from abiotic processes {{because of the lack}} of detailed knowledge of planetary conditions (the 'problem of exoplanet thermodynamic uncertainty'). A rejection of the hypothesis would require that the origin <b>of</b> <b>life</b> usually occurs on habitable planets, that spectrally detectable pigments and/or metabolisms that produce unequivocal biosignature gases (e. g. oxygenic photosynthesis) usually evolve and that the organisms that harbour them usually achieve a sufficient biomass to produce biosignatures detectable to alien astronomers.
