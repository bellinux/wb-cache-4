5|$|Virginia {{made some}} {{attempts}} {{to phase out}} slavery, and manumissions had increased {{in the first two}} decades after the war. Thomas Jefferson Randolph gained passage of an 1832 resolution for gradual abolition in the state, but by that time, increased demand from development in the Deep South created a large internal market for slavery. The invention of the cotton gin in the late-eighteenth century had enabled the profitable cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> in the uplands, which was widely used.|$|E
25|$|In the US as a whole, by 1810 {{the number}} of free blacks reached 186,446, or 13.5 percent of all blacks. After that period, few slaves were freed, as the {{development}} of cotton plantations featuring <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> in the Deep South drove up the internal demand for slaves in the domestic slave trade and high prices were paid.|$|E
25|$|With {{the entire}} area still {{occupied}} primarily by Cherokee, the city developed to serve the agrarian needs of the new cotton-based economy. Invention of the cotton gin {{in the late eighteenth}} century made processing of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> profitable. This was the type of cotton that best thrived in the upland areas, in contrast to that grown on the Sea Islands and in the Low Country.|$|E
60|$|The seed of the long-stapled cotton, now {{cultivated}} in America, was sent there in 1786 from the Bahama Islands, {{by some of}} the royalist refugees, who had settled there. The inferior <b>short-stapled</b> <b>cotton</b> had been previously cultivated for domestic purposes. The seeds of every other variety have been tried without success. The kind now grown was first introduced into Georgia. Thus to the refugees America owes as much of her prosperity as is due to the cotton-crops, and much of whatever harm is to result from slavery.|$|R
50|$|Steaming or {{artificial}} humidity was {{the process}} of injecting steam from boilers into cotton weaving sheds in Lancashire, England, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The intention was to prevent breakages in <b>short-staple</b> Indian Surat <b>cotton</b> which was introduced in 1862 during a blockade of American cotton {{at the time of}} the American Civil War. There was considerable concern about the health implications of steaming. Believed to cause ill health, this practice became the subject of much campaigning and investigation from the 1880s to the 1920s. A number of Acts of Parliament imposed modifications.|$|R
50|$|By 1870 three {{principal}} railroads—the Central of Georgia, the Savannah and Charleston and the Savannah and Gulf—connected {{the city}} to markets along the coast and the interior. The Central of Georgia, whose principal shareholder was the city of Savannah, established its own docks and canals {{to the west of}} the existing Savannah riverfront. This marks the first shift of industrial-commercial activity outside of the central plan of the city. An additional railroad was built extending from the Drayton Street Depot out to Tybee Island in 1887. The rate, 1 cent per mile or 17.7 cents each way, enabled city dwellers to escape to the ocean and spend their newfound leisure hours at the beach on Tybee Island. This became the first commuter line from Savannah to an outlying area.19th-century development in Savannah was dominated by the emergence of cotton as a widespread cash crop and a subsequent shift in the economy of the city. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 by Eli Whitney changed the face of agriculture in the American South. Whitney’s gin was produced in response to the state of Georgia’s appointed commission for the promotion of a gin suitable to remove seed from fibers on the <b>short-staple,</b> green-seed <b>cotton.</b> Whitney developed the gin at Mulberry Grove Plantation outside Savannah while he was a tutor to the children of Revolutionary War General Nathanael Greene.|$|R
25|$|The {{entrepreneur}} Jamsetji Tata (1839–1904) {{began his}} industrial career in 1877 with the Central India Spinning, Weaving, and Manufacturing Company in Bombay. While other Indian mills produced cheap coarse yarn (and later cloth) using local <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> and cheap machinery imported from Britain, Tata did much better by importing expensive longer-stapled cotton from Egypt and buying more complex ring-spindle machinery from the United States to spin finer yarn that could compete with imports from Britain.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} decades, Goldsborough's growth continued {{in part by}} new railroad connections to Charlotte and Beaufort. By 1861, the town's population {{was estimated to be}} 1,500. It was the trading center of a rural area that started with yeoman farmers. By this time, it had been developed as large cotton plantations dependent on the labor of enslaved African Americans, as the invention of the cotton gin had enabled profitable cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> in the upcounties.|$|E
25|$|Eli Whitney's {{invention}} of the cotton gin in 1793, made processing of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> profitable, and it was cultivated throughout the South to satisfy US and international demand. Statistical data shows that while less than 10% of {{the inhabitants of the}} North were slaves, by 1790, Virginia held 44% of the total slave population. It was common in agriculture, with a more massive presence in the South – the region where climate was more propitious for widescale agricultural activity.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time that the {{importation}} of slaves from Africa was being restricted or eliminated, the United States was undergoing a rapid expansion of cotton, sugar cane and rice production in the Deep South and the West. Invention of the cotton gin enabled the profitable cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton,</b> which could be produced more widely than other types; this led to King Cotton throughout the Deep South. Slaves were treated as a commodity by owners and traders alike, and were regarded as the crucial labor for the production of lucrative cash crops that fed the triangle trade.|$|E
25|$|Although Columbia {{replaced}} {{it as the}} state capital in 1788, Charleston became even more prosperous as Eli Whitney's 1793 invention of the cotton gin sped the processing of the crop over 50 times. The development made <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> profitable and opened the upland Piedmont region to slave-based cotton plantations, previously restricted to the sea islands and Lowcountry. Britain's Industrial Revolution—initially built upon its textile industry—took up the extra production ravenously and it was swiftly Charleston's major export commodity. The Bank of South Carolina, the second-oldest building {{in the nation to}} be constructed as a bank, was established in 1798. Branches of the First and Second Bank of the United States were also located in Charleston in 1800 and 1817.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the cotton gin in 1793 enabled the cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> {{in a wide variety}} of mainland areas, leading in the 19th century to the development of large areas of the Deep South as cotton country. Tobacco was very labor-intensive, as was rice cultivation. In South Carolina in 1720, about 65% of the population consisted of enslaved people. Planters (defined by historians in the Upper South as those who held 20 enslaved people or more) used enslaved workers to cultivate commodity crops. They also worked in the artisanal trades on large plantations and in many southern port cities. Backwoods subsistence farmers, the later wave of settlers in the 18th century who settled along the Appalachian Mountains and backcountry, seldom held enslaved people.|$|E
25|$|Slater {{constructed}} a new mill in 1793 {{for the sole}} purpose of textile manufacture under the name Almy, Brown & Slater, as he was now partners with Almy and Brown. It was a 72-spindle mill; the patenting of Eli Whitney's cotton gin in 1794 reduced the labor in processing cotton. It also enabled profitable cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton,</b> which could be grown in the interior uplands, resulting in a dramatic expansion of cotton cultivation throughout the Deep South in the antebellum years. The New England mills and their labor force of free men depended on southern cotton, which was based on slave labor. Slater also brought the Sunday School system from his native England to his textile factory at Pawtucket.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, {{the state had}} voted to reopen its ports to {{importing}} slaves from Africa; this decision was highly controversial and opposed by many planters in the Lowcountry, who feared the disruptive influence of new Africans on their slaves. Planters in Upland areas were developing new plantations of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> and needed workers, so the state approved the trade. The profitability of this type cotton had been {{made possible by the}} invention of the cotton gin. From 1804 to 1808, Charleston merchants imported some 75,000 slaves, more than were brought to South Carolina in the 75 years before the Revolution. Some of these slaves were sold to the Uplands and other areas, but many of the new Africans were held in Charleston and on nearby Lowcountry plantations.|$|E
25|$|Settlers, {{mostly from}} Georgia and the Carolinas, flooded into the fertile land that the Creeks {{had been forced}} to give up. With its {{strategic}} location at the river confluence, Wetumpka quickly became an important center of agricultural trade. The city was formally incorporated in 1834. Cotton was the commodity crop of the new state of Alabama, with cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> in the upland areas made possible by Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin, which reduced the labor of processing. From the scattered fields and large plantations worked by slave labor in the interior, cotton was carted overland to Wetumpka. Located at the fall line of the Coosa River, the port shipped out cotton bales by steamboats which went downriver to the markets at Mobile for sale.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the population in South Carolina was black, with concentrations in the plantation areas of the Low Country: by 1860 the population of the state was 703,620, with 57 percent or slightly more than 402,000 classified as enslaved African Americans. Free blacks numbered slightly less than 10,000. A concentration of free people of color lived in Charleston, where they formed an elite racial caste of people who had more skills and education than most blacks. Unlike Virginia, where most of the larger plantations and slaves were concentrated {{in the eastern part of}} the state, in South Carolina plantations and slaves became common throughout much of the state. After 1794, Eli Whitney's cotton gin allowed cotton plantations for <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> to be widely developed in the Piedmont area, which became known as the Black Belt.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{economic}} {{enterprise of}} the county was rice planting, particularly along the Satilla River. Sea Island cotton was grown on Cumberland Island, and <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> was grown on the mainland along with sugar cane. Various forest products including turpentine and timber were produced, mainly for consumption in the naval industry and the West Indies. Camden County {{also served as a}} hub of backcountry trade with American settlers and various Indian groups, and as a shipyard and shipping center centered around the town of St. Marys. The land in Camden County was owned by fewer than 300 people throughout the colonial and antebellum eras. Most of the white population worked in trades or as tenant farmers, while nearly all black residents were slaves. Until the 1840s (and increasingly strict black codes), Camden County had a small population of free black workers, mainly involved in day labor or maritime industry.|$|E
25|$|After {{invention}} of the cotton gin made profitable the processing of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton,</b> {{there was a major}} push by whites to develop lands in the Deep South for such cultivation. This greatly increased the demand for slave labor, especially after the US ended the legal Atlantic slave trade in 1808. The rate of manumission fell sharply in southern states. Through the domestic slave trade, some one million slaves were transported from the Upper South to the Deep South in the following years. Most southern states tightened restrictions on manumission, effectively ending it. They enacted laws requiring legislative approval for each act of manumission, making it so difficult that few slaveholders pursued this, even for their own mixed-race children. At the same time African Americans attempted to resist racialized definitions of freedom. Petitions for freedom suits were {{one of the most powerful}} strategies to redefine racial categories, claim freedom, and reconstitute families in the face of enslavement.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} decades, the colony {{cultivated}} cotton on plantations {{of the sea}} islands and Low Country, along with rice, indigo and some tobacco as commodity crops, all worked by African slaves, most from West Africa. In the 19th century, invention of the cotton gin enabled profitable processing of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton,</b> which grew better in the Piedmont than did long-staple cotton. The hilly upland areas, where landowners were generally subsistence farmers with few slaves, were much poorer; a regional conflict between the coastal and inland areas developed in the political system, long dominated by the Low Country planters. With outspoken leaders such as John C. Calhoun, the state vied with Virginia as the dominant political and social force in the South. It fought federal tariffs in the 1830s and demanded that its rights to practice slavery be recognized in newly established territories. With the 1860 election of Republicans under Abraham Lincoln, who vowed to prevent slavery's expansion, the voters demanded secession. In December 1860, the state seceded from the Union; in February 1861, it joined the new Confederate States of America.|$|E
2500|$|Augusta {{developed}} {{rapidly as}} a market town as the Black Belt in the Piedmont {{was developed for}} cotton cultivation. Invention of the cotton gin made processing of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> profitable, and this type of cotton was well-suited to the upland areas. Cotton plantations were worked by slave labor, {{with hundreds of thousands}} of slaves shipped from the Upper South to the Deep South in the domestic slave trade. Many of the slaves were brought from the Lowcountry, where their Gullah culture had developed on the large Sea Island cotton and rice plantations ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, {{during the}} 1820s and 1830s the Creek, Cherokee, and {{virtually}} all the southeastern Indians were removed to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). The Cherokee removal is remembered as the Trail of Tears. [...] The Cherokee capital city of New Echota was located on the headwater tributaries of the Coosa River, in Georgia, until the tribe's removal. The Creek and Choctaw removals were similar to the Cherokee Trail of Tears. After the removals, the Coosa River valley and the southeast in general was wide open for American settlers. The cotton gin made <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> profitable to process, {{and it was a}} new cotton hybrid that could be grown in the upland regions; large-scale migrations known as [...] "Alabama Fever" [...] filled Alabama with new settlers.|$|E
2500|$|The growing {{international}} {{demand for}} cotton led many plantation owners further west {{in search of}} suitable land. In addition, {{the invention of the}} cotton gin in 1793 enabled profitable processing of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton,</b> which could readily be grown in the uplands. The invention revolutionized the cotton industry by increasing fifty-fold the quantity of cotton that could be processed in a day. At the end of the War of 1812, fewer than 300,000 bales of cotton were produced nationally. By 1820 the amount of cotton produced had increased to 600,000 bales, and by 1850 it had reached 4,000,000. There was an explosive growth of cotton cultivation throughout the Deep South and greatly increased demand for slave labor to support it. As a result, manumissions decreased dramatically in the South.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prohibition}} of the African slave-trade after 1807 limited {{the supply of}} slaves in the United States. [...] Slaveholders looked at the fertility of slave women {{as part of their}} productivity, and intermittently forced the women to have large numbers of children. The invention of the cotton gin enabled expanded cultivation in the uplands of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton,</b> leading to clearing lands cultivating cotton through large areas of the Deep South, especially the Black Belt. The demand for labor in the area increased sharply and an internal slave market expanded. At the same time, the Upper South had an excess supply of slaves because of a shift to mixed crops agriculture, which was less labor-intensive than tobacco. During this time period, the terms [...] "breeding slaves", [...] "child bearing women", [...] "breeding period", and [...] "too old to breed" [...] became familiar.|$|E
50|$|Settled {{first because}} of its coastal access, the Lowcountry had the greater population. It had {{achieved}} early economic dominance because of wealth derived from the cultivation of both rice and long-staple cotton, a major crop. This was easier to process by hand than <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton.</b> In the Upcountry's soil, only <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> could be cultivated. It was extremely labor-intensive to process by hand.|$|E
50|$|During {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, colonists used enslaved African Americans to clear land, {{cultivate}} plantations, and process cotton in this area. Long-staple cotton would not grow in this area and <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> required much labor to process. In 1793, Mount Pleasant, a cotton plantation east of Washington, was the site where Eli Whitney first perfected his revolutionary invention, the cotton gin. It allowed mechanization of processing of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton,</b> making its cultivation profitable in the upland areas. As a result, there was a dramatic increase in the development of new cotton plantations throughout the Deep South to cultivate <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton.</b> Settlers increased pressure on the federal government to remove Native Americans, including the Five Civilized Tribes from the Southeast. Congress passed the Indian Removal Act in 1830.|$|E
50|$|Although {{planters}} {{tried to}} grow {{it on the}} uplands of Georgia, the quality was inferior, {{and it was too}} expensive to process. The invention of the cotton gin {{by the end of the}} 18th century utterly changed the production of cotton as a commodity crop. It made processing of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> profitable. This cotton, known as upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), could be grown successfully in the interior uplands. <b>Short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> became the prime commodity crop of the developing Deep South, and King Cotton was the basis of southern wealth in the antebellum years. This cotton in the early 21st century represents about 95% of U.S. production.|$|E
50|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, the districts and {{counties}} were developed chiefly as cotton plantations for <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton.</b> This development followed {{the invention of}} the cotton gin in the late eighteenth century, which made the processing of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> profitable. The county became a center of labor by black slaves on the plantations, who were transported from coastal areas and the Upper South to cultivate and process cotton. Those brought from the coastal areas were likely of the Gullah culture and language. The enslaved African Americans greatly outnumbered the white planters and non-slaveholding whites. Reflecting the patterns of nineteenth-century settlement, the area is still chiefly agricultural and majority-African American in population.|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} {{developed}} for the cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> after Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin in 1793, which made processing {{of this type of}} cotton profitable. Previously it was considered too labor-intensive. <b>Short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> was widely cultivated on plantations in upland areas throughout the Deep South, through an interior area that became known as the Black Belt. The increased demand for slave labor resulted in the forced migration of more than one million African-American slaves into the area through sales in the domestic slave market. By the time of the Civil War, the county's population was majority black and majority slave.|$|E
50|$|Bulloch also {{developed}} a plantation in the uplands, where his workers cultivated and processed <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton,</b> the chief commodity crop. This cotton had been made profitable by invention of the cotton gin, and was planted throughout the piedmont.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{this area}} was {{developed}} for the cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> in the antebellum era after {{the invention of the}} cotton gin. The area was also a center of lumbering and turpentine production in the early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The city of Bennettsville {{was founded}} in 1819 on the Great Pee Dee River and named after Thomas Bennett, Jr., then {{governor}} of South Carolina. The area was developed for <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> cultivation, dependent on the labor of enslaved African Americans. Many {{were brought to the}} upland area from the Lowcountry, carrying their Gullah culture with them. Others were transported from the Upper South by slave traders. This shift to cotton cultivation in the uplands was based {{on the development of the}} cotton gin, which made <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton,</b> cotton with relatively short fibers, profitable. The advent of the gin in turn led to development of large cotton plantations throughout the Deep South.|$|E
50|$|More than {{a century}} ago the Meches used to {{practice}} ‘jhum’ cultivation, that is cutting and burning the jungles and then sowing different seeds in each hole made by dibblers and sowers. <b>Short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> was their cash crop. They had no idea of cultivation with bullocks and the plough.|$|E
50|$|In the US as a whole, by 1810 {{the number}} of free blacks reached 186,446, or 13.5 percent of all blacks. After that period, few slaves were freed, as the {{development}} of cotton plantations featuring <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> in the Deep South drove up the internal demand for slaves in the domestic slave trade and high prices were paid.|$|E
50|$|The upland area {{also was}} {{developed}} for cotton plantations, after invention of the cotton gin made growing <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> profitable. Several mansions and a plantation have been preserved from this era: Blocker House, Cedar Grove, Darby Plantation, and together with the Edgefield Historic District, Horn Creek Baptist Church, and Pottersville, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
50|$|This {{area was}} {{developed}} for cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> in the 19th century, after {{the invention of the}} cotton gin, which made processing this type of cotton profitable. The antebellum residence was identified as notable by the state of South Carolina in 1983 and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.|$|E
50|$|In the Southern states, {{slavery was}} {{integral}} {{to the economy and}} expanded after the Revolution, due largely {{to the development of the}} cotton gin, making cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> profitable as a commodity crop throughout the Deep South, in the early to mid-19th century. Slavery in the states was protected from Federal interference by the new Constitution of the United States.|$|E
