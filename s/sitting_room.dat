5|$|As {{a popular}} and {{acceptable}} activity, botany {{had been taken}} up by many middle class ladies, and Darwin included these botany enthusiasts in his correspondence.

5|$|As Nazi Germany was {{collapsing}} {{towards the}} end of the war, Braun swore loyalty to Hitler and went to Berlin to be by his side in the heavily reinforced Führerbunker beneath the Reich Chancellery. As Red Army troops fought their way into the neighbourhood on 29 April 1945, she married Hitler during a brief civil ceremony; she was 33 and he was 56. Less than 40 hours later, they committed suicide together in a <b>sitting</b> <b>room</b> of the bunker, she by biting into a capsule of cyanide, and he by a gunshot to the head. The German public was unaware of Braun's relationship with Hitler until after their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Filming for {{the episode}} {{took place between}} 12 and 27 October 2005. The scenes set in Versailles were filmed elsewhere; the first scenes filmed in which Reinette's body is taken away from city were filmed at Culverhouse Cross in Cardiff, Madame de Pompadour's <b>sitting</b> <b>room</b> and bedroom scenes were filmed at Tredegar Housea 17th-century mansion in Newport, Dyffryn Gardens in the Vale of Glamorgan {{was used as the}} set for the palace gardens, and Ragley Hall near Alcester was used for the ballroom scenes. The scenes on the spaceship, which were shot by the second unit, were also filmed in Newport.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{there were}} servants quarters and spaces {{on the ground}} floor, and a library in the north room on the second floor, {{as well as a}} <b>sitting</b> <b>room</b> over the octagonal drawing room. According to Repton, the design should allow ground floor rooms where the garden is visible and directly accessible, meaning that servants quarters needed to be placed in their own wing, but without prominence so as to maintain the hierarchy. In the south-east corner of the building there was a gothic loggia which was glazed in the 19th century to create a conservatory, some time after the conservatory in the American Garden was removed.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, the old Butler Wright house {{became the}} golf house. It {{was at the}} center of the club's {{sporting}} operations, originally holding a pro shop, dining room, bar, and bedrooms. In 1931, it was refurbished with more showers and dressing rooms, an addition to the locker room to double its space and increase the lounge space, an enlarged kitchen, a new women's locker room and <b>sitting</b> <b>room,</b> a larger dining veranda, an enclosed porch on the northwest corner of the building, and a new porch on the building's east side. The club's first pool was constructed adjoining the house in 1930, necessitating the construction of the showers and dressing rooms. The building was demolished in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Nash's {{designs for}} the house {{included}} a three-storey octagonal tower, with two wings coming off it and a second square tower above a porte-cochère. Inside the drawing room occupied {{the ground floor of}} the tower, with a <b>sitting</b> <b>room</b> above. The dining room was designed to hold views across the valley, and the asymmetric rooms allowed for a panorama of views. To allow easy access to the gardens, the servant's quarters were moved to a separate wing, but made to be less prominent. A chapel was added in approximately 1862, and the house's loggia was converted into a conservatory.|$|E
5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Lincoln Room is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln painted by 19th-century American portraitist Edward Dalton Marchant; {{it is one of}} a number of drawings, paintings, and photographs of Lincoln used to decorate this room.

5|$|This was {{the main}} family <b>sitting</b> <b>room</b> on the ground floor, with the south-facing grand window giving views to the gardens, and was remodelled by John Lyte in 1533. In the early 17th century Thomas Lyte added the wood {{paneling}} (including Ionic pilasters) and the internal porch: these decorative features also had the practical benefit of keeping out the drafts. In the 20th century the room was {{being used as a}} store for farm equipment. Sir Walter Jenner had the paint stripped from the panelling to reveal the original warm-coloured oak.|$|E
5|$|In December 2001, aged 101, she {{fractured}} her pelvis in a fall. Even so, {{she insisted}} on standing for the National Anthem during the memorial service for her husband on 6 February the following year. Just three days later, her second daughter Princess Margaret died. On 13 February 2002, the Queen Mother fell and cut her arm in her <b>sitting</b> <b>room</b> at Sandringham House; an ambulance and doctor were called, and the wound was dressed. She was still determined to attend Margaret's funeral at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, two days later on the Friday of that week, even though the Queen {{and the rest of}} the royal family were concerned about the journey the Queen Mother would face to get from Norfolk to Windsor; she was also rumoured to be hardly eating. Nevertheless, she flew to Windsor by helicopter, and so that no photographs of her in a wheelchair could be taken—she insisted that she be shielded from the press—she travelled to the service in a people carrier with blacked–out windows, which had been previously used by Margaret.|$|E
5|$|In the White House, Clinton placed donated {{handicrafts}} {{of contemporary}} American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating {{display in the}} state rooms. She oversaw {{the restoration of the}} Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II. Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter. These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines. Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln <b>Sitting</b> <b>Room</b> being criticized the most. Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration {{at the turn of the}} 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.|$|E
