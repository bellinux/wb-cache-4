5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, CMLL left the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) but {{retained}} {{control of the}} NWA World Welterweight Championship as their main championship of the welterweight division. They also promoted the Mexican National Welterweight Championship as a <b>secondary</b> <b>title</b> for the Welterweight division. In 1991 they decided to create a series of CMLL-branded world championships, {{one of which was}} for the welterweight division. They held a four-man tournament on February 15, 1992, to crown the first welterweight champion. The participants were Fuerza Guerrera, El Felino, América and El Khalifa; in the finals, Fuerza Guerrera defeated El Khalifa to become the first champion. On July 16, 1992, the Mexican National Welterweight Champion defeated CMLL Welterweight Champion América, vacating the Mexican National Welterweight Championship.

5|$|The Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship was {{originally}} {{created in the}} late 1960s or early 1970s by Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL; who would change their name to CMLL around 1990) as a <b>secondary</b> <b>title</b> to the Mexican National Tag Team Championship, which was the promotion's top tag team title at the time. Records of champions from that era are sparse with no records of {{who was the first}} champion; nor are there any records of exactly when the title was abandoned in the 1980s. Due to sparse record keeping of local wrestling in Mexico between the 1960s and early 1980s no clear history exists from that time, it has been verified that Los Villanos (Villano I and Villano II), Kung Fu and Kato Kung Lee, and the team of Dios Rojo and Dios Negro all held the Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship due to references to the teams defending the championship at an EMLL show.|$|E

The repackaging of the original names of Lau Pa Sat in Roman script, and inclusion of the appearance of an English translation as a <b>secondary</b> <b>title</b> {{can be seen as a}} way of heightening the sense of authenticity and heritage of the attraction as it is marketed as a culturally-rich area in Singapore, similar to Chinatown and Little India; both of which were formerly cultural enclaves of the distinctive races. Similarly in places that bear cultural significance, the signs are printed in the language associated with the culture, such as The Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall which has an entirely Chinese sign without any translations.|$|E
