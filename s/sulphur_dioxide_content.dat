40|$|Grapes {{have long}} been {{appreciated}} for their rich content of phenolic compounds such as gallic acid, (+) -catechin, anthocyanins and resveratrol, and a wide diversity of proanthocyanidins (PAs). In the grape berries, the flavan- 3 -ols ((+) -catechins and PAs) {{are present in the}} solid parts of grapes (stems, skins and particularly seeds) and exist with different degrees of polymerization (dimers, trimmers, tetramers and polymers). Several factors could determine the grape PA content, namely, grape variety, viticulture practices and environment conditions. On the other hand, during winemaking process, the extraction rate from grape to must during maceration and alcoholic fermentation, depends on several factors, such as concentration of PAs in grape, alcohol content, <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>content,</b> maceration time and temperature. Also, several winemaking techniques could enhance their extraction, such as, cold soak, must freezing with dry ice and treatments using pectolytic enzymes. However, the application of protein fining agents, mannoproteins or oenological tannins could also have an important impact on the wine PAs concentration and composition. Thus, the main purpose of this chapter is to show a review about the structural characteristics and composition of PAs in grapes and wines, including the main factors that could determine PAs concentration. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Beer, as manufactured, {{is not at}} {{chemical}} equilibrium and undergoes complex {{chemical reactions}} during storage {{which can lead to}} undesirable changes in the sensory characteristics of beer. Since beer contains more than 600 volatile compounds, beer flavour change is a complex field of research and the dependable prediction of shelf life remains a top research priority. Chapter 1 places the work described in this thesis into this context. Chapters 2 and 3 provide details of the experimental methods used and their development, respectively, to evaluate flavour stability. The methods used and developed include: (i) the determination of one of the major antioxidants present in beer, sulphur dioxide (SO 2), via distillation; (ii) a solid phase micro extraction (SPME) -GC-MS method with on fibre derivatization as a reliable detection method for aldehydes related to off flavours perceived in aged beer; (iii) measurement of the oxidative stability using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Chapter 4 describes oxidative stability measurements via EPR spectroscopy for three different lager-style beer qualities pre- and post-filtration. The trial included a large scale Kieselguhr frame filter, and two pilot-scale membrane filtration system. The results illustrate how EPR spectroscopy is sensitive to metal ion pick-up from traditional filter media and oxidative stability measures were evaluated versus oxygen pick up during filtration and <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>content</b> of the beer samples. The effect of a brewhouse addition of gallotannins on the flavour stability of a lager-style beer was investigated in Chapter 5. Pilot scale (16 hl) and large scale production line (1500 hl) experiments with gallotannins additions in the Brewhouse were performed. The effects of the different additions were monitored at key points of the production process and through to the final beer. Despite showing significant improvements in the pilot scale wort samples, the results for the related packed beer samples did not show clear flavour stability improvements. For the production-scale trials, only a very limited effect of improved flavour stability could be observed. In Chapter 6 a factorial experimental design was adopted to probe the interactions between seven factors known to impact on beer flavour stability. Chemical additions were made to a bright beer prior to bottling, to vary the following factors: total in pack oxygen, SO 2, total iron, iso-α-acid and α-acid content, (+) -catechin and glutathione. Increased SO 2 concentrations had the largest impact across the entire design space, resulting in reduced radical formation, staling aldehyde concentrations and improved sensory scores. The impacts of increased TIPO levels were rather limited. In contrast, a significant impact regarding the oxidative stability could be observed for increasing Fe concentration, highlighting the significance of pro-oxidative effects of transition metals...|$|E
40|$|Overall, {{chemical}} and microbiological analyses {{are very important}} for the quality of wine during and after winemaking process. One of the most important factors during wine storage is the temperature of storage. During storage of red wines in tanks, barrique barrels or glass bottles underway many physical, {{chemical and}} biochemical changes, which have significant influence for the stabilize of taste, scent, colour and general character of wine. The aim of our study we used two different wines, specifically Cabernet Sauvignon and Blaufränkisch and chemically and microbiologically analysed these wines during storage at different temperatures. These wines were bottled in 2011 and 2013. We stored these samples at different temperatures. The first four samples were stored at 6 - 8 °C in refrigerator, and the next four were stored at 20 - 25 °C in room temperature. We had together eight wine samples. We had determined in all wine samples sequentially the free and total <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>content,</b> ethyl-alcohol content, extract, sugars, total and volatile acids.

40|$|The {{emission}} of green house gases is becoming of ever increasing worries {{to the international}} community. The fossil fuel consumption is still increasing and therefore the {{emission of}} the green house gases. Many uncertainties exist around the negative effects arising from large concentrations of green house gases in the atmosphere. To prevent possible negative effects in the future many countries start taking action to reduce the emission of these gases {{a good example is}} off course the Kyoto protocol. With the actions taken by the different countries new legislations are made. To be able to comply with these increasingly stricter rules the performance of the treatment installations of plants that produce large quantities of green house gases has to be improved. Large producers of green house gases are the coal fired power plants. Therefore in this project a conceptual design for a process is made that removes SO 2 and CO 2 from the flue gas of such a power plant. The first important action taken in making the conceptual design is to define a clear task for the process. The defined task demanded that a conceptual design is made for a process that removes at least 99. 3 % of the <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>content</b> from the flue gas. The process captures as well at least 6 % of the carbon dioxide from the flue gas. The sulphur dioxide is converted to a useful product and the carbon dioxide is just separated and the further processing is outside the scope of this project. For the separation of carbon dioxide and the separation and conversion of sulphur dioxide different process options are investigated from literature. From the results of this literature study the process options are compared and the best options are selected for further design. For the separation of carbon dioxide scrubbing the flue gas stream with Mono Ethanol Amine (MEA) is selected as the most realistic and feasible process. The separation of sulphur dioxide is done by hollow fibres which show great potential in the field of selectivity consumption of energy. For the conversion of sulphur dioxide two potentially good options were found. One biochemical process and one chemical process were selected. These processes were combined with the membrane separation section. From these combinations two preliminary bases of design have been made. The comparison between the two preliminary BOD’s resulted in the selection of the biotreatment process. However after further investigation that assumptions made in integrating the membrane with the conversion sections caused too many uncertainties concerning the feasibility of this process that the chemical process is further developed. The chemical process is based on a process developed at the international research institute ISPRA and is called Mark- 13 A. In this process the sulphur dioxide is together with bromine and water converted to sulphuric acid and hydrogen bromide and the sulphuric acid. The sulphuric acid is concentrated and sold. The hydrogen bromide is regenerated back to bromine with electrolysis. During this electrolysis hydrogen is formed in the same amount as bromine. The overall process converts almost 99. 8 % of the sulphur dioxide and separates 6 % of the carbon dioxide. A total amount of 50000 t/a technical grade sulphuric acid is produced. From conceptual process equipment design the total investment is estimated to be around 150 M. The largest part of this investment goes to the sulphur dioxide separation membrane section. The meet the specified separation 177 membrane units of 1 x 2 m are needed. However when comparing this required investment with other flue gas desulphurization units like a unit build in Bulgaria at the Maritza coal plant which costs 650 M the investment seems feasible...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc Food Sc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2003. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{study shows}} the {{potential}} of near infrared spectroscopy for both qualitative and quantitative analyses of wine and brandy in the distilling industry. Wines intended for further processing by the distillation industry have to meet certain specifications to ensure an efficient and cost-effective distilling process with a suitable product yield. Certain compounds have, therefore, been recognised as significant quality parameters and through their regulation, a product of consistent quality can be ensured. These quality parameters include alcohol, total acid, volatile acid, total sulphur dioxide, total phenolics, reducing sugars and acetaldehyde concentrations and pH. The effective control of all these compounds in the wines prior to distillation, is critical to maintain the feasibility and efficiency of the process. Fourier transform near infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) {{can be used as}} a rapid and accurate analytical method for the determination of alcohol concentrations in distilling and brandy base wine. The choice of path length for the liquid sampling cell is an important consideration. In this study, alcohol with its strong absorption of OH bands in the near infrared region was not significantly affected, but difference in path length showed a significant influence on the prediction of the volatile acid concentration in distilling wine. Very strong correlations were found between the spectral data and the alcohol concentration data in distilling wine (r = 0. 99, SEP = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 30) and brandy base wine (r = 0. 92, SEP = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 11. 1). Good predictions were obtained for the volatile acid content of brandy base wine (r = 0. 85, SEP = 0. 04 g. L- 1) but better accuracy could be obtained by incorporating a wider concentration range and more sensitive, although not the accepted reference methods, such as HPLC and GC, into the modelling. In contrast to the brandy base wine, the much cruder, turbid distilling wine (r = 0. 67, SEP = 0. 33 g. L- 1) yielded poor calibration results for volatile acid. FT-NIRS can also be used as a rapid screening method to measure the total acid content, pH and total phenol levels in brandy base wine samples. Satisfactory predictions were obtained for the total acid content (r = 0. 89, SECV = 0. 38 g. L- 1), pH (r = 0. 84, SEP = 0. 09) and total phenol levels (r = 0. 71, SEP = 16. 4 mq. L" GAE). The SEP of all the parameters compared well with the SEL and were within acceptable limits. The range of the concentration measurements were, however, very narrow and the accuracy of these models (measured as the ratio of the range to the standard error of prediction) were all below 10, indicating that modelling of these parameters in brandy base wine should be attempted with reference values covering a wider range. Poor correlations and predictions were obtained between the wine spectral data and the acetaldehyde (r = 0. 39, SECV = 1. 45 rnq. L"), residual sugar (r = 0. 58, SECV = 0. 49 mq. L") and total sulphur dioxide (r = 0. 35, SEP = 10. 9 mq. L") concentration data. The unique character of potstill distillates, originating from the grape cultivar, type and age of the oak casks, lends itself to the development and blending of different brandies. The process of blending and correcting the brandy is necessary to obtain a product and brand of established and recognised character. The brandy is generally divided into different classes prior to blending based on the degree of "smoothness" or "hardness" of the matured distillate as determined by a sensorial panel. The ideal would, however, be to replace this subjective evaluation method with a more objective approach, such as an instrumental method like NIRS. Near infrared spectroscopy showed potential to successfully discriminate and classify brandy samples in terms of their sensorial classification status. The near infrared spectra of unblended three-year old brandies were measured and discriminant analysis performed using the subjective sensory classification data of the brandy. SIMCA (soft independent modelling of class analogy) models were developed by calculating separate peA (principal component analysis) models for each of the classes for which qualitative analysis were required. An assessment of class membership of an unknown sample was made on the basis of the distance to the cluster centroid. Two types of NIRS instruments, a Fourier transform near infrared system and a diode array spectrophotometer were employed to examine the discriminatory abilities of NIRS. Excellent predictions (90. 9 %- 100 %) were obtained for the "smoothest" and "hardest" classes within the 2000 and 2001 seasons with FT-NIRS. For the diode array spectra reasonable classification data were obtained for all the classes within the 2000 and 2001 seasons, as well as an excellent classification rate (100 %) of the smoothest class in the 1999 season. Prediction results for class membership of the brandy samples from the three season's combined data did not deliver satisfactory discriminatory results. By applying NIRS and SIMCA, rapid and objective classification of brandy samples within seasonal context can be established to enhance the blending processes. Having accurate reference data in the calibration set is essential in near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The precision (usually decided by blind duplicate determination) of the reference data serves as the performance target for correlation-based near infrared analysis. The differences between reference values obtained from two independent laboratories and the Foss Winescan FT 120, which is also a predictive method, for the alcohol and volatile acid determinations in distilling wine and between two independent laboratories for the measurement of the total <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>content,</b> were investigated. ANOVA and post-hoc analysis (Bonferroni testing) revealed statistically significant differences (p<O. OS) between all three measurements for the volatile acid analysis. One laboratory differed significantly from the other two measurements in its measurement of the alcohol content in distilling wine. A paired t-test performed on the two laboratories' values obtained for total sulphur dioxide revealed statistically significant differences (p<O. OS) between the two sets of results. This study restated the importance of obtaining reliable reference data for calibration purposes to maintain the efficiency and accuracy and therefore the reputability of NIRS as an accurate and reliable analytical method. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Hierdie studie dui op die potensiaal van naby infrarooi spektroskopie (NIRS) vir beide die kwalitatiewe en kwantitatiewe analise van wyn en brandewyn in die distillasie industrie. Sekere spesifikasies word gestel waaraan wyn met voldoen voor dit verdere prosessering tydens distillasie kan ondergaan. Die regulering van wynkwaliteit is noodsaaklik om die distilleringsproses ekonomies volhoubaar te maak. Sekere komponente in die wyn het 'n direkte invloed op die kwaliteit van die eindproduk en word beskou as betekenisvolle parameters wat beheer moet word om 'n produk van konstante hoë kwaliteit te lewer. Hierdie parameters sluit alkohol, titreerbare suur- en vlugtige suurinhoud, asook die pH, totale swaweidioksied, totale fenol vlakke, reduserende suikers en asetaldehied konsentrasies in. Die regulering van al hierdie komponente in die wyne is essensieel voor die aanvang van distillasie om die effektiwiteit en produktiwiteit van die proses te verseker. Fourier transformasie naby-infrarooi spektroskopie (FT-NIRS) kan benut word as 'n vinnige en akkurate analitiese metode om die alkohol konsentrasie in stook- en rabatwyn te bepaal. 'n Geskikte padlengte kuvet moet gekies word vir die ontleding van vloeistof monsters met NIRS. In hierdie studie is gevind dat die voorspelling van alkoholkonsentrasie in wyn, nie soseer beïnvloed is deur die keuse van padlengte nie. 'n Vlugtige komponent soos asynsuur, wat die maatstaf van die vlugtige suurinhoud van die wyn is, word egter regstreeks beïnvloed deur die keuse van padlengte. 'n Sterk korrelasie is gevind in die datastel vir die alkoholinhoud van die stookwyn (r = 0. 99, SEP = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 30) en rabatwyn (r = 0. 92, SECV = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 11. 1). Baie goeie voorspellings is ook gevind vir die vlugtige suurinhoud van rabatwyn (r = 0. 85, SEP = 0. 04 g. L- 1). Die akkuraatheid van die metode (uitgedruk as die RER waarde) het egter aangedui dat 'n wyer konsentrasie omvang en meer akkurate verwysingswaardes gebruik moet word om 'n geskikte model vir vlugtige suur kwantifikasie in rabatwyn te bewerkstellig. In teenstelling met die resultate verkry vir die rabatwyn, het die ruwer, turbiede stookwyn swak gekalibreer vir die vlugtige suurinhoud (r = 0. 67, SEP = 0. 33 g. L- 1). FT-NIRS kan ook gebruik word as 'n vinnige seleksie metode om titreerbare suur vlakke, pH en totale fenolinhoud van rabatwyn monsters te bepaal. Sterk korrelasies is in die datastel gevind vir die titreerbare suurinhoud (r = 0. 89, SECV = 0. 38 g. L- 1), pH (r = 0. 84, SEP = 0. 09) en totale fenol vlakke (r = 0. 71, SEP = 16. 4 rnq. L" GAE) van rabatwyn. Die SEP waardes verkry vanaf die NIRS bepalings het baie goed vergelyk met die standaard foute wat verkry is vir die chemiese bepalings. Die konsentrasie omvang van die verwysingswaardes was, egter, beperk en die akkuraatheid van die NIRS modelle (uitgedruk as die verhouding tussen die konsentrasie omvang en die standaard fout van voorspelling) was laer as 10. Dit het daarop gedui dat die NIRS kalibrasie van die parameters eerder uitgevoer moet word met monsters wat 'n wyer konsentrasie omvang dek en gemeet is met meer sensitiewe analitiese metodes soos HPLC en GC. Die kalibrasie en voorspelling van die asetaldehied inhoud (r = 0. 39, SECV = 1. 45 rnq. L"), reduserende suiker konsentrasie (r = 0. 58, SECV = 0. 49 mq. L") en totale swaweldioksiedinhoud (r = 0. 35, SEP = 10. 9 rnq. L") het onaanvaarbare voorspellings gelewer. Die unieke karakter van potketel distillate wat bepaal word deur die druifkultivar, tipe en ouderdom van die eikehoutvate, bied die potensiaal vir die ontwikkeling en versnyding van verskillende style brandewyn. In 'n poging om 'n produk en handelsnaam van erkende en gevestigde karakter te verkry, moet die brandewyn eers versny word na veroudering. Die brandewyn word geklassifiseer in verskillende style op grond van sensoriese gehalte. NIRS is gebruik as 'n vinnige tegniek om te onderskei tussen verskillende style onversnyde drie jaar-oue brandewyn. SIMCA (soft independent modelling of class analogy) modelle is ontwerp deur aparte PCA (hoof komponent analise) modelle vir elke klas waarvoor kwalitatiewe analise vereis is, te ontwikkel. 'n Skating van klas lidmaatskap van 'n onbekende monster is gemaak deur die afstand van die monster na die groepsmiddelpunt te bereken. Twee soorte NIRS instrumente, 'n FT-NIR en 'n diode array spektrofotometer is gebruik tydens die studie om die diskrimineringsvermoë van elk te ondersoek. Uitstekende voorspellings (90. 9 %- 100 %) is gekry vir die "sagste" en "hardste" klasse binne die 2000 en 2001 seisoene met FTStellenbosch NIRS. Met die diode array spektra is redelike klassifikasie resultate verkry vir al die klasse binne die 2000 en 2001 seisoene, asook 'n uitstekende klassifikasie (100 %) vir die sagste klas binne die 1999 seisoen. Voorspellings vir klas lidmaatskap van die brandewyn monsters vir die drie seisoene se gekombineerde data het egter onaanvaarbare diskriminasie resultate gelewer. NIRS en SIMCA sal 'n vinnige en objektiewe klassifikasie proses van onversnyde brandewyn monsters kan meebring wat tot voordeel van die versnydings- en produksieproses sal wees. Hierdie voorspellings sal egter binne seisoensverband moet geskied. Akkurate verwysingsdata in die kalibrasie datastel is 'n essensiële fasset van naby infrarooi spektroskopie. Die presisie (bepaal deur blinde duplikaat bepalngs) van die verwysingsdata dien as 'n prestasie teiken vir korrelasie-gebaseerde naby infrarooi voorspellings. Die verskille tussen die data verkry vir die alkohol- en vlugtige suurinhoud van stookwyn deur twee onafhanklike laboratoriums en 'n instrumentele metode (Foss Winescan FT 120) asook die verskille tussen die data verkry van twee laboratoriums vir die totale swaweidioksied metings, is ondersoek. ANOVA en post-hoc toetse het aangedui dat al die data verkry vir die vlugtige suur bepalings, statisties betekenisvol van mekaar verskil het (p< 0. 05). Vir die alkohol bepalings in stookwyn, het die data verkry van een laboratorium betekensvol verskil van die ander twee datastelle. Gepaarde t-toetse uitgevoer op die data verkry vir totale swaweldioksiedinhoud, het ook betekinisvolle verskille aangedui tussen die twee laboratoriums. Hierdie studie het die belangrikheid van betroubare verwysingsdata vir kalibrasie doeleindes beklemtoon, veral waar 'n tegniek soos NIRS se werksverrigting afhang van die akkuraatheid van dié waardes...|$|E

40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of free molecular and bound forms of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and oxygen on the viability and culturability of a selected strain of Acetobacter pasteurianus and a selected strain of Brettanomyces bruxellensis in wine. Methods and Results: Acetic acid bacteria and Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts associated with wine spoilage were isolated from bottled commercial red wines. One bacterium, A. pasteurianus strain A 8, and one yeast, B. bruxellensis strain B 3 a, were selected for further study. The resistance to <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and the effect of oxygen addition on these two selected strains were determined by using plating and epifluorescence techniques for monitoring cell viability in wine. Acetobacter pasteurianus A 8 was more resistant to <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> than B. bruxellensis B 3 a, with the latter being rapidly affected by a short exposure time to free molecular form of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> As expected, neither of these microbial strains was affected by the bound form of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> The addition of oxygen negated the difference observed between plate and epifluorescence counts for A. pasteurianus A 8 during storage, while it stimulated growth of B. bruxellensis B 3 a. Conclusions: Acetobacter pasteurianus A 8 can survive under anaerobic conditions in wine in the presence of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Brettanomyces bruxellensis B 3 a is more sensitive to <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> than A. pasteurianus A 8, but can grow in the presence of oxygen. Care should be taken to exclude oxygen from contact with wine when it is being transferred or moved. Significance and Impact of the Study: Wine spoilage can be avoided by preventing growth of undesirable acetic acid bacteria and Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts through the effective use of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and the management of oxygen throughout the winemaking process. © 2005 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

40|$|Iron(II), <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and sugars such as lactose are {{potential}} reducing agents for manganese dioxide to produce manganese(II) for subsequent hydrometallurgical treatment. The leaching of limonitic laterite and manganiferrous ores with <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> produces iron(II) {{which in turn}} can catalyse the leaching of manganese dioxide in acid media. This paper presents a critical analysis of the kinetics of reductive dissolution of synthetic manganese dioxide and manganese ore to compare and contrast the effect of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and iron(II) in acid media containing sulphate or perchlorate anions. Both one-electron and two-electron mechanisms are considered {{in the case of}} <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> The current knowledge on chemical speciation is used to construct an Eh-pH diagram to show the effect of complexation of Mn(II), Fe(II) and Fe(III) with sulphate.

40|$|Abstract. Intact chloroplasts {{isolated}} from <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> fumigated Hardwickia binata leaves showed inhibition of PS II electron transport activity without any {{significant effect on}} photosystem I. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> exposed leaves accumulated more hydrogen peroxide than those from non-fumigated plants and this was caused by increase in superoxide radical production. Hydrogen peroxide formation was inhibited by addition of cytochrome C and superoxide disrnutase. In <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> fumigated leaves, increase in superoxide dismutase activity showed resistance to sulphite toxicity. The localization of ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities in chloroplasts provide evidence for the photogeneration of ascorbate.

40|$|For {{technological}} and economical reasons, in the grape juices production the long time storage of the must {{is made by}} addition of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> (up to 2000 mg/l).

Therefore a mathematical model was given to predict the <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> stripping by the steam generated from the must; {{in fact it is}} forbidden to utilise steam of the boiler.

40|$|The {{polarographic}} or voltammetric behaviour of {{a selected}} group of tetra-alkyl ammonium halides and related compounds in liquid <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> was investigated, using a stationary disk platinum indicating micro-electrode and a silver/silver-bromide reference electrode with {{compensation for the}} IR drop of the solution. The electrochemical oxidation-reduction patterns are characteristic of the natures of the cation and anion composing the compound. Generally, good reproducible polarograms are obtained. The anodic patterns indicate that the oxidation of each halogen ion can occur in multiple stages, although the bromides generally show only a single anodic wave. The order of ease of electrolytic oxidation in <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> is iodide (easiest), bromide and chloride. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> solutions of the tetra-alkyl ammonium salts show a characteristic cathodic discharge potential {{in the range of}} - 0 [middle dot] 3 to - 0 [middle dot] 6 V vs Ag/AgBr.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen {{dioxide in the}} presence of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> over a standard Pt/SiO 2 catalyst (EuroPt- 1) was studied. The gas-phase reactions between nitric oxide, <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and oxygen were found to be insignificant under the experimental conditions concerned. The Pt/SiO 2 catalyst was observed to be very active in catalyzing the reactions both of NO + O 2 to NO 2 and of SO 2 + O 2 to SO 3. In the presence of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide,</b> the catalytic activity for nitric oxide oxidation dropped dramatically, and in contrast, the presence of nitric oxide promoted <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> oxidation. There is significant influence of NO/NO 2 on <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> oxidation; there are indications from temperature-programmed desorption and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) that some sort of complex species (e. g.

It is believed that the deactivation of the catalyst was mainly caused by the build-up of some nitrogen and sulphur compounds on the active sites of the platinum catalyst. Another reason for the deactivation could be the sintering of platinum particles in the reaction environment.
