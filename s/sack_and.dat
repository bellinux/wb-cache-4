5|$|After {{removing}} her corpse {{from the}} canvas <b>sack</b> <b>and</b> beginning the post mortem examination, pathologist Keith Simpson told Ranson {{he was certain}} that Rivett had been killed before her body was placed in the <b>sack,</b> <b>and</b> that in his opinion the lead pipe found at the scene could be the murder weapon. Her estranged husband, Roger, had an alibi for the night concerned, and was eliminated from police inquiries. Other male friends and boyfriends were questioned and discounted as suspects. Her parents confirmed that Sandra had a good working relationship with Lady Lucan, and was extremely fond of the children. Meanwhile, Lucan had yet to make an appearance, and so his description was circulated to police forces across the country. Newspapers and television stations were told only that Lucan was wanted by the police for questioning.|$|E
50|$|On defense, the 2000 Purdue {{team had}} true {{freshman}} safety Stuart Schweigert, who intercepted five passes and also lead {{the team in}} tackles with 85.

50|$|In 1999-2000, {{the mill}} had 1,939 looms for hessian, 1,103 for <b>sacking</b> <b>and</b> 234 for carpet backing cloth (CBC). The looms in {{operation}} were 1085 for hessian, 726 for <b>sacking,</b> <b>and</b> 172 for CBC. Budgeted weaving production was 19,002 ton of hessian, 34,609 ton of <b>sacking</b> <b>and</b> 6,004 ton of CBC for the year. Actual production, {{on the other}} hand, was 10,284 ton of hessian, 21,236 ton of <b>sacking,</b> <b>and</b> 3,254 ton of CBC. The mill had 515 officers, 1,561 support staff and 16,443 workers. Man-days per ton estimated for 1999-2000 were 218 for hessian, 94 for <b>sacking</b> <b>and</b> 131 for CBC, which were 189, 88 and 112 respectively in 1995-1996. The Adamjee Jute Mill has more manpower than it actually requires for production of hessian, <b>sacking</b> <b>and</b> CBC. Also, the man-days required to produce these items have also increased {{in the last five}} years. The mill has, however, achieved some improvements in terms of use of raw materials. In 1995-1996, the raw jute required to produce a ton of hessian per ton was 1,672 kg, a ton of <b>sacking</b> 1,494 kg <b>and</b> a ton of CBC 1,813 kg. The comparative figures for 1999-2000 were 1,281 kg for hessian, 1,104 kg for <b>sacking,</b> <b>and</b> 1,447 kg for CBC. A rise in the wage cost per ton from Tk 23,092, 15,780 and 22,248 for hessian, <b>sacking</b> <b>and</b> CBC respectively in 1995-1996 to Tk 27,248, Tk 18,596 and Tk 25,800 respectively in 1999-2000 has, however, offset the economy achieved in use of raw materials.|$|R

5|$|Thus, {{it is seen}} in {{the time}} of Emperor Hadrian (r.117–138 CE), the {{punishment}} for parricide was basically made optional, in that the convict might be thrown into the arena instead. Furthermore, a rescript from Hadrian is preserved in the fourth century CE grammarian Dositheus Magister that contains the information that the cart with the <b>sack</b> <b>and</b> its live contents was driven by black oxen.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2007 season, Alston {{competed with}} Ron Warner and Jabari Issa for a {{starting}} {{role on the}} Eskimos. He made the active roster and originally split time with Warner and Robert Brown as a defensive lineman. In August, Alston replaced Adam Braidwood as the starting defensive end, but he was injured with a hip pointer {{in his first game}} in that role.

5|$|Strong safety Ray Austin, who {{had been}} named most {{valuable}} player in the Volunteers' loss to Penn State during the 1993 Citrus Bowl, had 50 tackles—second-best among Tennessee defensive backs—two fumble recoveries, a <b>sack,</b> <b>and</b> two tackles for loss despite playing in only six games. The Volunteers' defense also featured a cornerback named Tony Edge, a player from Virginia's Phoebus High School {{who had been}} heavily recruited by both Virginia Tech and Tennessee. Edge suffered a dislocated shoulder in the Volunteers' last regular-season game, but pledged he would play against the Hokies despite doctors' disapproval.|$|E
5|$|Tech's {{first drive}} began inauspiciously for the Hokies. Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} {{pass on the}} first Tech play, then was sacked for a four-yard loss. Facing third down, Druckenmiller evaded another <b>sack</b> <b>and</b> connected with Oxendine on a 41-yard pass that picked up a first down and pushed Tech into the Nebraska side of the field. Despite the gain, the Hokies were unable to gain another first down as Oxendine ran for one yard before Druckenmiller threw two successive incomplete passes. Virginia Tech punter Jimmy Kibble kicked the ball back to Nebraska, which returned it to its 15-yard line, and the Nebraska offense returned to the field.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee's Herman Lathers led all {{defenders}} with 12 total tackles, including 2 tackles for loss, both career highs.

50|$|<b>Sacks</b> <b>and</b> blocks may be {{used during}} flooding, where sacks are filled with material, {{allowing}} for blocks to encourage drainage and vegetation growth.

25|$|The Chargers had an {{excellent}} defensive line, anchored by Pro Bowl defensive end Leslie O'Neal, who led the team with 12.5 <b>sacks</b> <b>and</b> forced four fumbles, defensive tackle Chris Mims, who recorded 11 <b>sacks,</b> <b>and</b> Shawn Lee, who added 6.5 <b>sacks</b> <b>and</b> a fumble recovery. Their linebacking corps was led by Junior Seau, who was a Pro Bowl selection for the fourth consecutive year, recording 123 tackles, 5.5 <b>sacks,</b> <b>and</b> 3 fumble recoveries.

Safety Rodney Harrison was a rookie on the team.|$|R
5|$|The Green Bay Packers {{had seven}} {{different}} players each contribute a <b>sack,</b> <b>and</b> Randy Wright's 190 yards passing {{made him the}} second player in Packers history to throw for 3,000 yards in a season. The crowd cheered the news that an Indianapolis Colts win moved the Buccaneers into first place {{for the rights to}} the first overall draft pick, and pelted Buccaneer players with lemons. Ron Holmes's sack of Wright was the Buccaneers' first since Oct. 12, and Ivory Sully recorded the first blocked punt in Buccaneers (regular-season) history. Both teams went to their second-string quarterbacks in the second half, but Steve Young returned to the game after Steve DeBerg suffered a concussion, and Wright was reinserted after the Buccaneers threatened to start a comeback.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, {{both teams}} found success at times. In the first half, Texas' defense held the Hokies {{to just one}} touchdown, {{and that was not}} {{recorded}} until the second quarter. Virginia Tech's offense was extremely successful in shutting down the Longhorns' offense {{in the second half of}} the game. The Hokies shut out the Longhorns in that half, setting a bowl-game record for fewest points allowed in a half. Texas' 10 points, 78 yards rushing and 226 yards total offense were all season lows. In total, Tech's defense had nine tackles for loss, including five sacks of Brown. Linebacker Brandon Semones was Tech's leading tackler, and he had nine tackles, a <b>sack,</b> <b>and</b> a pass breakup. In pass defense, Torrian Gray had two interceptions, and William Yarborough had one. Gray's interceptions tied a Virginia Tech bowl-game record. Defensive tackle Jim Barron's fumble return for a touchdown was the first such score in the Sugar Bowl since a rule change in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Following Thermopylae, the Persian army {{proceeded}} to <b>sack</b> <b>and</b> burn Plataea and Thespiae, the Boeotian cities {{that had not}} submitted, before it marched on the now evacuated city of Athens. Meanwhile, the Greeks (for the most part Peloponnesians) preparing to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, demolished the single road that led through it and built a wall across it. As at Thermopylae, making this an effective strategy required the Greek navy to stage a simultaneous blockade, barring {{the passage of the}} Persian navy across the Saronic Gulf, so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese. However, instead of a mere blockade, Themistocles persuaded the Greeks to seek a decisive victory against the Persian fleet. Luring the Persian navy into the Straits of Salamis, the Greek fleet was able to destroy much of the Persian fleet in the Battle of Salamis, which essentially ended the threat to the Peloponnese.|$|E

5|$|Mr. McGregor {{does not}} notice the substitution, and carries the sack home, {{continually}} counting the six rabbits. His wife claims the skins for herself, intending to line her old cloak with them. But when she {{reaches into the}} <b>sack</b> <b>and</b> feels the vegetables and discovers them, she becomes very, very, angry. Then, as a result, she accuses her husband of playing a trick with her. And Mr. Mc Gregor becomes very angry too, and he throws a rotten vegetable marrow out through the window, hitting {{the youngest of the}} eavesdropping bunnies who has been sitting on the window-sill (leaving the Mc Gregors to argue). Their parents decide it is time to go home. At Christmas, they send the heroic little wood mouse a quantity of rabbit-wool. She makes herself a cloak and a hood, and a muff and mittens.|$|E
5|$|Veteran quarterback Bill Kenney, {{making the}} {{start for the}} Kansas City Chiefs {{in place of the}} {{struggling}} Todd Blackledge, completed 15 of 29 passes for 230 yards and a touchdown. The Chiefs' offensive line protected Kenney well, allowing only one <b>sack</b> <b>and</b> few hurries. Although the Buccaneers led at halftime on a 10-yard pass from Steve Young to Calvin Magee and two Donald Igwebuike field goals, they were unable to hold the lead in the second half. They tied the game at 20 on a fourth-quarter touchdown run, James Wilder's first of the year, but immediately allowed the Chiefs to drive the length of the field for the winning touchdown. The sloppily played game included four fumbles, six sacks, two interceptions, and 17 penalties for 146 yards. Art Still contributed three of the Chiefs' five sacks.|$|E
5|$|Yoshikawa {{develops}} {{misgivings about}} Asami after {{he is unable}} to reach any of the references on her résumé, such as a music producer she claimed to work for, who is missing. However, Aoyama is so enthralled by her that he pursues her anyway. She lives in an empty apartment, containing a <b>sack</b> <b>and</b> a phone. For four days after the audition, she sits perfectly still next to the phone waiting for it to ring. When it finally does, she answers pretending that she never expected Aoyama to call. After several dates, she agrees to accompany him to a seaside hotel, where a smitten Aoyama intends to propose marriage. At the hotel, Asami reveals burn scars on her body. Before making love, Asami demands that Aoyama pledge his love to her and no one else. A deeply moved Aoyama agrees. In the morning, Asami is nowhere to be found.|$|E
