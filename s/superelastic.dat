5000|$|Nitinol {{acts as a}} super spring {{through the}} <b>Superelastic</b> effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Superelastic</b> alloys {{belong to}} the larger family of shape-memory alloys. When {{mechanically}} loaded, a <b>superelastic</b> alloy deforms reversibly to very high strains (up to 10%) by {{the creation of a}} stress-induced phase. When the load is removed, the new phase becomes unstable and the material regains its original shape. Unlike shape-memory alloys, no change in temperature is needed for the alloy to recover its initial shape.|$|E
50|$|<b>Superelastic</b> devices take {{advantage}} of their large, reversible deformation and include antennas, eyeglass frames, and biomedical stents.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the high}} damping {{capacity}} of <b>Superelastic</b> nitinol, it is also used as a golf club insert.|$|E
50|$|While the R-phase {{transformation}} {{is a first}} order transformation and the R-phase is distinct and separate from martensite and austenite, it {{is followed by a}} second order transformation: a gradual shrinking of the rhombohedral angle and concomitant increased transformational strain. By suppressing martensite formation and allowing the second order transformation to continue, the transformational strain can be maximized. Such measures have shown memory and <b>superelastic</b> effects of nearly 1%. In commercially available <b>superelastic</b> alloys, however, the R-phase transformational strain is only 0.25 to 0.50 percent.|$|E
5000|$|The R-phase is a phase {{found in}} nitinol, a shape-memory alloy. It is a {{martensitic}} phase in nature, {{but is not}} the martensite {{that is responsible for}} the shape memory and <b>superelastic</b> effect.|$|E
5000|$|When {{austenite}} transforms to the R-phase, {{its energy}} is reduced and its propensity to transform to martensite is lessened, {{leading to a}} larger austenite-martensite hysteresis. This, in turn reduces actuator efficiency and <b>superelastic</b> energy storage capacity.|$|E
50|$|Freelance {{journalist}} Paul Brown, {{who wrote}} the original FourFourTwo article on the UFWC and maintains the UFWC website, wrote {{a book on the}} championship which was published by <b>Superelastic</b> in 2011. Written in English, it has also been translated into Japanese.|$|E
50|$|Nitinol {{is highly}} {{biocompatible}} and has properties {{suitable for use}} in orthopedic implants. Due to Nitinol's unique properties it has seen a large demand for use in less invasive medical devices. Nitinol tubing is commonly used in catheters, stents, and <b>superelastic</b> needles.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Superelastic</b> Nitinol finds {{a variety}} of {{applications}} in civil structures such as bridges and buildings. One such application is Intelligent Reinforced Concrete (IRC), which incorporates Ni-Ti wires embedded within the concrete. These wires can sense cracks and contract to heal macro-sized cracks.|$|E
5000|$|Niti wires {{are known}} to have another unique {{property}} known as Superelasticity. It is the [...] "rubber-like" [...] behavior present in the Niti shape memory alloy. <b>Superelastic</b> Niti wires have excellent springback compared to other niti wires. They can also deliver constant forces over large wire-deflection.|$|E
50|$|Fistula clip closure (OTSC Proctology) is {{the latest}} {{surgical}} development, which involves {{the closure of the}} internal fistula opening with a <b>superelastic</b> clip made of nitinol (OTSC). During surgery, the fistula tract is debrided with a special fistula brush and the clip is transanally applied {{with the aid of a}} preloaded clip applicator. The surgical principle of this technique relies on the dynamic compression and permanent closure of the internal fistula opening by the <b>superelastic</b> clip. Consequently, the fistula tract dries out and heals instead of being kept open by continuous feeding with stool and fecal organisms. This minimally-invasive sphincter-preserving technique has been developed and clinically implemented by the German surgeon Ruediger Prosst. First clinical data of the clip closure technique demonstrate a success rate of 90% for previously untreated fistulae and a success rate of 70% for recurrent fistulae.|$|E
50|$|NiTinol {{is used in}} a {{wide range}} of medical devices, in {{particular}} in the cardiovascular field. In fact, its <b>superelastic</b> properties are ideal for the manufacturing of the devices used in the field of non-invasive surgery, such as catheters to navigate within the cardiovascular system and self-expanding devices (aortic and peripheral stents or heart valves).|$|E

Usually 0 ≤ e ≤ 1, in which e = 1 for completely elastic collisions, and e = 0 for completely inelastic collisions. It's possible for e ≥ 1 to occur - for <b>superelastic</b> (or explosive) collisions.|$|E
50|$|Five {{affiliate}} societies {{focused on}} {{specific areas of}} materials science also fall under the ASM umbrella: The Heat Treating Society (HTS), the Thermal Spray Society (TSS), the International Metallographic Society (IMS), the Electronic Device Failure Analysis Society (EDFAS), and Shape Memory and <b>Superelastic</b> Technology (SMST). Each society is led by volunteers, produces specific technical content for members, and holds its own international event.|$|E
5000|$|In bearing lifing tests {{conducted}} by NASA, SM-100 {{has been shown}} to have over twice the life of 440C stainless steel and over ten times the life of conventional titanium alloys with a significantly lower coefficient of friction. [...] The <b>superelastic</b> nature of the material gives it the ability to withstand compression loading of well over [...] with no permanent yielding.|$|E
50|$|In 1994 Ormco Corporation {{introduced}} this alloy. This alloy was developed {{with the help}} of Rohit Sachdeva and Suchio Miyasaki. Initially, it was available in three temperature transition forms: <b>Superelastic</b> (CuNiTi 27oC), heat-activated (CuNiTi 35oC) and (CuNiTi 40oC). This alloy is composed of nickel, titanium, copper (5%) and chromium (0.2% - 0.5%). Addition of copper leads to better defined transition temperatures in this alloy.|$|E
50|$|SMA are {{materials}} that can exhibit {{the property of}} remembering their original shape even after being severely deformed. Thanks to their intrinsic shape memory and <b>superelastic</b> effects, they represent an enabling technology for implantable medical devices and actuators. SAES Getters deals with designing new materials on a theoretical level, developing new alloys on an industrial scale as well as modeling and manufacturing new components.|$|E
5000|$|NiTiNOL 60, or 60 NiTiNOL, is a Nickel Titanium alloy (nominally Ni-40wt% Ti) {{discovered}} in the late 1950s by the U. S. Naval Ordnance Laboratory (hence the [...] "NOL" [...] portion of the name NiTiNOL). [...] Depending upon the heat treat history, 60 NiTiNOL {{has the ability to}} exhibit either <b>superelastic</b> properties in the hardened state or shape memory characteristics in the softened state.|$|E
50|$|Nitinol {{biocompatibility}} is {{an important}} factor in biomedical applications. Nitinol (NiTi), which is formed by alloying nickel and titanium (~ 50% Ni), is a shape memory alloy with <b>superelastic</b> properties more similar to that of bone, when in compared to stainless steel, another commonly used biomaterial. Biomedical applications that utilize Nitinol include stents, heart valve tools, bone anchors, staples, septal defect devices and implants. It is a commonly used biomaterial especially in the development of stent technology.|$|E
50|$|SMAs {{are being}} {{explored}} as vibration dampers for launch vehicles and commercial jet engines. The {{large amount of}} hysteresis observed during the <b>superelastic</b> effect allow SMAs to dissipate energy and dampen vibrations. These materials show promise for reducing the high vibration loads on payloads during launch {{as well as on}} fan blades in commercial jet engines, allowing for more lightweight and efficient designs. SMAs also exhibit potential for other high shock applications such as ball bearings and landing gear.|$|E
50|$|This law {{actually}} holds only approximately, {{and only}} when the deformation (extension or contraction) is small compared to the rod's overall length. For deformations beyond the elastic limit, atomic bonds get broken or rearranged, and a spring may snap, buckle, or permanently deform. Many materials have no clearly defined elastic limit, and Hooke's law can not be meaningfully applied to these materials. Moreover, for the <b>superelastic</b> materials, the linear relationship between force and displacement is appropriate only in the low-strain region.|$|E
5000|$|... e > 1: This would {{represent}} a collision in which energy is released, for example, nitrocellulose billiard balls can literally explode {{at the point of}} impact. Also, some recent articles have described <b>superelastic</b> collisions in which it is argued that the COR can take a value greater than one in a special case of oblique collisions. These phenomena are due to the change of rebound trajectory caused by friction. In such collision kinetic energy is increased in a manner energy is released in some sort of explosion. It is possible that [...] for a perfect explosion of a rigid system.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{passivation}} {{techniques can}} greatly increase the corrosion resistance of nitinol. In order for nitinol {{to have the}} desired <b>superelastic</b> and shape memory properties, heat treatment is required. After heat treatment, the surface oxide layer contains a larger concentration of nickel {{in the form of}} NiO2 and NiO. This increase in nickel has been attributed to the diffusion of nickel out of the bulk material and into the surface layer during elevated temperature treatments. Surface characterization methods have shown that some surface passivation treatments decrease the concentration of NiO2 and NiO within the surface layer, leaving a higher concentration of the more stable TiO2 than in raw, heat-treated Nitinol.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the feasibility of Cu-Al-Mn <b>superelastic</b> alloy bars as possible self-sensor components, taking electrical resistance measurement as a feedback. <b>Superelastic</b> alloy bars change their crystallographic structure with phase transformation, as well as electrical resistance during loading–unloading process at ambient temperature. This work studies the relationship between strain and electrical resistance measurements of <b>superelastic</b> alloys at room temperature.

Quasi-static cyclic tensile tests are conducted in this article to investigate the relationship between electrical resistance and strain for a 4 -mm-diameter Cu-Al-Mn <b>superelastic</b> alloy bar. It was demonstrated that linear relationship with little hysteresis can be achieved up to 10 % strain.

40|$|Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are a {{relatively}} new class of functional materials, exhibiting special thermomechanical behaviors, such as shape memory effect and superelasticity, which enable their applications in seismic engineering as energy dissipation devices. This paper investigates the properties of <b>superelastic</b> NiTi shape memory alloys, emphasizing the influence of strain rate on <b>superelastic</b> behavior under various strain amplitudes by cyclic tensile tests. A novel constitutive equation based on Graesser and Cozzarelli’s model is proposed to describe the strain-rate-dependent hysteretic behavior of <b>superelastic</b> SMAs at different strain levels.

30|$|The {{reduction}} in the tensile strength of Ni-Ti <b>superelastic</b> alloy in 0.2 % acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) solution with pH 5.0 has been confirmed when {{the total amount of}} absorbed hydrogen exceeds 200 mass ppm (Yokoyama et al. 2003 a). However, the total amount of hydrogen obtained in that study (Yokoyama et al. 2003 a) was the average value of the entire specimen. Thus, the distribution of absorbed hydrogen in Ni-Ti <b>superelastic</b> alloy immersed in 0.2 % APF solution has not yet been evaluated quantitatively, although the hydrogen distribution can influence the hydrogen embrittlement behavior of the alloy. It has been suggested that changes in the distribution and state of hydrogen due to aging at room temperature dominate the tensile properties of cathodically hydrogen-charged Ni-Ti <b>superelastic</b> alloy (Yokoyama et al. 2007). In addition, the cathodically hydrogen-charged Ni-Ti <b>superelastic</b> alloy was reported to contain diffusive hydrogen, hydride, hydrogen in a solid solution, and trapped hydrogen (Yokoyama et al. 2007). Aging at room temperature caused diffusive hydrogen to diffuse out, and hydrogen in a solid solution, weakly trapped hydrogen, and hydrogen generated by the dissociation of hydride diffused {{into the center of the}} Ni-Ti <b>superelastic</b> alloy. The hydrogen state in the cathodically hydrogen-charged Ni-Ti <b>superelastic</b> alloy varies significantly by aging at room temperature; therefore, the mechanism for the hydrogen embrittlement of Ni-Ti <b>superelastic</b> alloy aged at room temperature has not yet been clarified sufficiently.|$|E
