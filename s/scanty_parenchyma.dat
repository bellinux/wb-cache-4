40|$|The {{secondary}} xylem of Craterispermeae, Coussareeae, Morindeae s. str., Prismatomerideae, Pauridiantheae, Urophylleae, and Triainolepideae (Rubiaceae, Rubioideae) is described and illustrated in detail. Genera {{that were previously}} placed in the Morindeae or Psychotrieae such as Damnacanthus, Lasianthus, Saldinia, and Trichosfachys are also included. Wood anatomical characters are compared with recent phylogenetic insights into the study group {{on the basis of}} molecular data. The observations demonstrate that the delimitation and separation of several taxa from the former Coussareeae/Morindeae/Prismatomerideae/Psychotrieae aggregate is supported by wood anatomical data. The Coussareeae can be distinguished from the other Rubioideae by their <b>scanty</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> septate libriform fibres, and the combination of uniseriate and very high multiseriate rays with sheath cells. Axial parenchyma bands and fibre-tracheids characterise Gynochtodes and some species of Morinda (Morindeae sstr.), but the latter genus is variable with respect to several features (e. g. vessel groupings and axial parenchyma distribution). Wood data support separation of Rennelia and Prismatomeris from Morindeae s. str.; vessels in both genera are exclusively solitary and axial parenchyma is always diffuse to diffuse-in-aggregates. Damnacanthus differs from the Morindeae alliance by the occurrence of septate fibres, absence of axial parenchyma, and the occasional presence of fibre wall thickenings. There are interesting similarities between members of the Lasianfhus clade and the Pauridiantheae/Urophyleae group such as the sporadic occurrence of spiral thickenings in axial parenchyma cells...|$|E
40|$|Features {{in which}} Agdestis differs from Phytolaccaceae s. s. include {{presence}} of both libriform fibers and vasicentric tracheids (rather {{than one or}} the other); bands and strands of thin-walled apotracheal parenchyma (in addition to paratracheal <b>scanty</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> and raylessness (also reported for Bougainvillea of Nyctaginaceae, a family close to Phytolaccaceae). Dimorphism in vessel diameter in Agdestis (narrow vessels like libriform fibers in diameter) is attributable to the lianoid habit. Packets of crystals coarser than typical for raphides occur idioblastically in Agdestis, as do raphides in Phytolacca. ln Phytolacca and in other Phytolaccaceae, one finds an unusual feature that occurs in Agdestis: nonbordered simple perforation plates. Anatomical data support Agdestis as forming a mono- generic subfamily within Phytolaccaceae s. l. The nature of successive cambia in Agdestis is compared with those in other Phytolaccaceae and in Nyctaginaceae. A common pattern is probably present, although differences in terminology and observations obscure the pattern. The term 2 ̆ 2 interxylary phloem 2 ̆ 2 is a misnomer because conjunctive tissue is not secondary xylem as generally understood. After cessation of the cambium in the first cylinder, radial rows of cells form outside the phloem and inside the cortex; this activity may constitute a lateral meristem. Apparently within the radial rows of cells, successive cambia form; each of these cambia produce secondary phloem externally and secondary xylem internally. There {{is little or no}} cambial activity in interfascicular areas...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} the single species of Plakothira, a {{recently}} discovered genus from the Marquesas Islands, is described qualitatively and quantitatively. Features new for the family include presence of vasicentric <b>scanty</b> axial <b>parenchyma</b> and presence of perforated ray cells. Plakothira has several wood features specialized for Loasaceae: vasicentric axial parenchyma, extremely reduced borders on fibertracheids, and storying in fiber-tracheids. Wood of Plakothira is clearly loasaceous. Storying in fibertracheids is reported here for the loasaceous genera Fuertesia and Mentzelia. Wood anatomy of Plakothira represents paedomorphosis in great length of vessel elements, erectness of ray cells, lack of change in large primary rays, and in presence of occasional scalariform perforation plates. Plakothira has wood features maximally mesomorphic for the family, correlating with its cloud-forest habitat and semisucculent wood and cortex structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{circumscription}} of Bignoniaceae genera and tribes {{has undergone}} major changes following an increased understanding of phylogenetic relationships within the family. While DNA sequence data have repeatedly reconstructed major clades within the family, {{some of the}} clades recovered still lack diagnostic morpho-anatomical features, complicating their recognition. In this study we investigated the wood anatomy of all major lineages of Bignoniaceae (except Tourrettieae) in search for anatomical synapomorphies for clades. We sampled 158 species of Bignoniaceae, representing 67 out of the 82 genera currently recognized. Detailed descriptions of quantitative and qualitative wood anatomical features are presented for each clade and interpreted {{in the light of}} a molecular phylogeny for the family. Jacarandae are characterized by a paratracheal winged-aliform parenchyma, with the traditional subdivision of Jacaranda into sections Monolobos and Dilobos supported by the uniseriate and homocellular rays of Monolobos versus the wide and heterocellular rays of Dilobos. Tecomeae s. s. are characterized by <b>scanty</b> paratracheal <b>parenchyma,</b> septate fibers, and heterocellular rays, traits also found in Delostoma, a genus previously included in Tecomeae s. l., but recently shown to represent a separate lineage. Crescentiina includes two sub-clades, the Tabebuia alliance and the Paleotropical clade, which share abundant aliform parenchyma, short and mainly homocellular rays, less commonly with heterocellular rays with body procumbent and one row of marginal square cells. Members of the Tabebuia alliance and the Paleotropical clade can be distinguished from each other by the narrow vessels with a widespread storied structure found in members of the Tabebuia alliance, versus the vessels with medium to wide width and a non-storied structure found in members of the Paleotropical clade. Oroxyleae are characterized by a combination of simple and foraminate perforation plates and homocellular rays, while Catalpeae are characterized by <b>scanty</b> paratracheal <b>parenchyma,</b> abundant tyloses and vessel-ray pits simple to semi-bordered. Bignonieae differ from all other clades by a variant secondary growth and a typically lianoid wood anatomy. Overall, wood anatomical characters are not very labile within the family, being distributed across clades in a very predictive manner. Several anatomical characters represent good anatomical synapomorphies and provide further support to clades identified in molecular phylogenetic studies...|$|R
40|$|Anatomical {{properties}} {{is necessary}} for wood species identification. This paper observes anatomical properties of six wood species originated from Papua. Wood species studied include: ketapang (Terminalia complanata K. Schum.); pala hutan (Gymnacranthera paniculata (A. DC.) Warb.); bipa (Pterygota horsfieldii (R. Br.) Kosterm).; kelumpang (Sterculia shillinglawii F. Muell.); manggis/kandis (Pentaphalangium parviflorum); and lancat/lebani (Mastixiodendron pachyclados (K. Schum) Melch.). Anatomical properties were observed according to IAWA (International Association of Wood Anatomists) checklist. The anatomical main properties observed in ketapang wood were vestured pits, prismatic crystals in non-chambered axial parenchyma cells, and druses. Pala hutan main anatomical properties were the presence of tannin tubes and oil cells which were associated with axial parenchyma. Prismatic crystals in axial parenchyma cells, and rays of two distinct sizes were two main anatomical characteristics of bipa and kelumpang wood. Prismatic crystals in chambered axial parenchyma cells was one of characteristics of manggis wood. Vestured pits and <b>scanty</b> paratracheal <b>parenchyma</b> were two main characteristics of lancat wood. For identification pur poses, bipa wood could be distinguished by banded parenchyma; polygonal alternate pits; and prismatic crystals in non- chambered axial parenchyma cells...|$|R

40|$|In Southern Brazil, in the Plateau of the State of Santa Catarina, {{species of}} Salix (willow), vernacularly called "vime", are {{cultivated}} for weaving crafts. The hybrid Salix x rubens Schrank (Salicaeae) is the widely cultivated {{species in the}} region. The research institute "Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecuária e Extensão Rural de Santa Catarina (EPAGRI) " {{in the city of}} Lages, is developing a program {{to improve the quality of}} the willow for basketry. Wood samples of young rods and the main trunk of Salix x rubens were collected, fixed and sectioned according to usual techniques in wood anatomy. Qualitative and quantitative features were described, following the IAWA Committee recommendations. Wood anatomy is characterized by solitary vessels, with simple perforation plate, alternate bordered intervessel pits, vessel-ray pits similar to intervessel pits, axial <b>parenchyma</b> <b>scanty</b> apotracheal to diffuse, septate and non-septate fibres, with simple to minutely bordered pits, uniseriate rays.

40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} Shorea mujongensis P. S. Ashton was {{investigated}} {{in order to ensure}} this species belongs to yellow meranti group. Such study is very important since this species is already listed in the red list of IUCN and classified as critically endangered species. The microscopic slides were prepared according to the Johansen 2 ̆ 7 s method, while the anatomical features observed according to the IAWA List. The results show that S. mujongensis wood exhibit brown heartwood, light brown sapwood, rough texture, straight grain sometimes interlocked and somewhat rough. The main microscopic characters are growth rings indistinct; vessel diffuse, mostly solitary, rounded to oval; simple perforation plate and alternate intervessel pits; <b>parenchyma</b> <b>scanty</b> paratracheal to thin vasicentric; axial intercellular canals in long tangential line, radial intercellular canal and vasicentric tracheids present; rays uniseriate and multiseriate, prismatic crystal in procumbent cells; fiber length 1, 294 µm, diameter 26 µm and wall thickness 4 µm. Macroscopic and microscopic observation of S. mujongensis wood confirms the species belongs to yellow meranti group. The assesment on fiber dimensions and derived values of the wood fibers classified the wood into class quality II. It indicates that this species is moderately favorable as raw material for pulp and paper manufacture...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} wood features are reported for 38 species representing 22 genera, including the scandent genera Mendoncia and Thunbergia. Woods of Acanthaceae {{are characterized by}} relatively narrow vessels with simple perforation plates and alternate lateral wall pitting, septate libriform fibers, <b>scanty</b> vasicentric axial <b>parenchyma,</b> rays both multiseriate and uniseriate, erect ray cells abundant in rays (some species rayless or near-rayless), numerous small crystals or cystoliths in ray cells in a few genera (first documented reports of both characters in woods of Acanthaceae), and nonstoried structure. This constellation of features is very closely matched by woods of Gesneriaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Pedaliaceae, Martyniaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Myoporaceae (families listed in order ofdecreasing resemblance). Narrowness ofvessels in tropical Acanthaceae appears related to understory ecology. A few species in warm and seasonally dry areas have narrow, short vessel elements numerous per unit transection. Vasicentric tracheids occur in two nonscandent genera in dry areas. Vessel grouping is roughly proportional to dryness of habitat. Thunbergia alata, T. laurifolia, and all collections of Mendoncia have interxylary phloem (first report for Mendoncia). That feature, plus presence of occasional acicular crystals in rays and axial parenchyma and presence of large gelatinous fibers in phloem ally Mendoncia closely with Thunbergia, and Mendonciaceae is not justified for this and other reasons. Species of Thunbergia differ among themselves, and T. erecta and T. holstii resemble shrubby Acanthaceae {{more than they do}} Mendoncia in wood features. Thunbergia thus should not be segregated from Acanthaceae...|$|R
40|$|Anatomy of Brazilian Cereeae (subfamily Cactoideae, Cactaceae) : Arrojadoa Britton & Rose, Stephanocereus A. Berger wâBrasilicereus Backeberg). Arrojadoa, Stephanocereus and Brasilicereus are endemic Brazilian Cereeae, {{occurring}} {{along the}} Espinhaço Range, in the campos rupestres, cerrados and caatingas, from northern Minas Gerais to southern Bahia. The genera are columnar, erect to semi-erect cacti, {{except for one}} species, A bahiensis, which is globose. This study describes the anatomy of dermal, fundamental and vascular systems, aiming to find diagnostic characters for the genera and species. Basal portions of stems were sectioned transversely and longitudinally, and stained with Astrablue and Safranin. The species share a uniseriate epidermis, with thick cuticle; well developed collenchymatic hypodermis, containing prismatic crystals; cortex with numerous mucilage cells, druses and vascular bundles; outside cortex as a palisade parenchyma; periderm composed of lignified cork cells alternating with suberized cells; pheloderm consisting of a few layers of thin-walled cells; phloem composed of solitary or multiple of two to three sieve tube elements, companion cells, axial and radial parenchyma; secondary xylem with solitary to multiple vessels, with simple perforation plates and alternate bordered to semi-bordered pits; axial <b>parenchyma</b> <b>scanty</b> vasicentric to incomplete; libriform septate fibres; large rays. Unlignified parenchyma {{is seen in the}} secondary xylem, varying from a few cells to bands among axial and radial elements. The following are considered diagnostic characters: the shape of lignified phellem cells, cubic to radially elongate, which individualizes S. leucostele; an underdeveloped hypodermis and the occurrence of sclereids in the cortex are exclusive to Brasilicereus markgrqfii...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for 44 collections representing 42 species in 27 genera. Lamiaceae basically have: vessels with simple perforation plates; vessel-to-vessel pitting alternate; imperforate tracheary elements all libriform fibers, fibers commonly septate; axial <b>parenchyma</b> <b>scanty</b> vasicentric; rays Heterogeneous Type IIB. These features ally Lamiaceae closely with Verbenaceae. In {{addition to the}} Mesomorphy ratio (based on vessel element dimensions), features that indicate wood xeromorphy in Lamiaceae, in probable increasing order of importance are: presence of indistinct to marked growth rings; presence of helical thickenings in vessels; presence of vasicentric or vascular tracheids; presence of vessel groups averaging three or more vessels per group. More mesomorphic woods in Lamiaceae occur in species that are arborescent to shrubby, and that occur in areas that have no prolonged drought. Helical sculpture in vessels is expressed not only as thickenings, but also as grooves interconnecting pit apertures (coalesced pit apertures), and inconspicuous thickenings in pairs along the grooves. Vascular tracheids (at ends of growth rings) occur in several genera. Where growth rings are very narrow (Salvia, Trichostema), vessels and tracheids are intermixed, thereby justifying description as vasicentric tracheids of what may have originated phylogenetically as vascular tracheids. This may represent one pathway for origin of vasicentric tracheids. Wide bands of axial parenchyma in Cuminia and Leptosceptrum have originated {{as a result of}} fiber dimorphism. Abundance of upright cells in numerous Lamiaceae is indicative ofpaedomorphosis, and may point to secondary woodiness in some instances; the family as a whole appears ancestrally moderately woody. The ratio between libriform fiber length and vessel element length marks Lamiaceae as specialized. Crystal presence and cambial variants are newly reported for the family...|$|R
