Whilst the Saracens were establishing themselves in former Byzantine territory, the Avars and Bulgars still remained along the Danube river, as did the Slavs, whose annual payment to the Empire was falling short. Constans II then decided to move his capital to Syracuse in Sicily in 662. Some <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> to escape horrible visions of his brother whom he had murdered 2 years past. His stay in Italy and Sicily can only be imagined as unpleasant for the locals. Everything of any value in Rome was requisitioned by the Byzantine army— even copper from the rooftops. It was to many people's relief that Constans II was murdered while bathing by his Greek servant on 15 September 668.|$|E

In the parking lot, Pam admits to Jim that it was she who wrote the graffiti. She begins to ask Jim a question, but stops when she notices the camera. A Chili's employee then talks to the camera and says that Pam apparently was sneaking drinks off of others' tables, which is against the restaurant's rules. [...] He then tells the audience that he Xeroxed her driver's license and she is never welcome at Chili's again. Jim helps Pam into Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) car and smiles as they leave.|$|E

Despite this, he wrote a mixed review, opining that [...] "as far as mysteries go, this was a so-so one," [...] that [...] "the Hearst campus rapist story just doesn't {{seem to be getting}} the proper weight it requires," [...] and that [...] "there's also some strange tonal issues currently." [...] However, he praised the return of Weevil. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, was also relatively critical, while focusing praise on Weevil's storyline. He referred to [...] "Wichita Linebacker" [...] as [...] "what I would expect were the show not so ambitious. Here, Veronica isn't going to Hearst College, she's going to Television College, where things that are college-y happen." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C+". [...] "I don't think it's being overly harsh to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not one of this show's stronger or more exciting episodes. The writing was oddly flat, in the first place, and the attention to detail was subpar as well." [...] In addition, the reviewer criticized the show's treatment of its relationships. [...] "That's one of the things that's made this show great in the past -- layering in complex and important relationships while not actually being a relationship-centered show. I only hope they go somewhere with the gambling thing, because otherwise, in my opinion, this episode will have been a total waste of time." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{belief that}} free trade would promote peace was widely shared by English liberals of the 19th and early 20th century, leading the {{economist}} John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), {{who was a}} classical liberal in his early life, to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a doctrine on which he was [...] "brought up" [...] and which he held unquestioned only until the 1920s. In his review {{of a book on}} Keynes, Michael S. Lawlor argues that it may be in large part due to Keynes' contributions in economics and politics, as in the implementation of the Marshall Plan and the way economies have been managed since his work [...] "that we have the luxury of not facing his unpalatable choice between free trade and full employment". A related manifestation of this idea was the argument of Norman Angell (1872–1967), most famously before World War I in The Great Illusion (1909), that the interdependence of the economies of the major powers was now so great that war between them was futile and irrational (and therefore unlikely).|$|E

2500|$|Among {{these objects}} is a wide-brimmed hat, the petasos, widely used by rural people of antiquity to protect {{themselves}} from the sun, and that in later times was adorned with a pair of small wings; sometimes the hat is not present, and may have been replaced with wings rising from the hair. [...] Another object is the Porta: a stick, called a rhabdomyolysis (stick) or skeptron (scepter), which is referred to as a magic wand. Some early sources <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the bat he received from Apollo, but others question the merits of this claim. It seems {{that there may have been}} two canes, one of a shepherd's staff, as stated in the Homeric Hymn, and the other a magic wand, according to some authors. His bat also came to be called kerykeion, the caduceus, in later times. [...] Early depictions of the staff show it as a baton stick topped by a golden way that resembled the number eight, though sometimes with its top truncated and open. Later the staff had two intertwined snakes and sometimes it was crowned with a pair of wings and a ball, but the old form remained in use even when Hermes was associated with Mercury by the Romans.|$|E
