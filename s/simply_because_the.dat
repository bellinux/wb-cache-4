5|$|An {{applicant}} has {{the burden}} of proving that a legislative restriction on {{the freedom of speech}} {{has nothing to do with}} public order, public health or morality. There must be some substance in the applicant's complaint – the Government does not have an immediate duty to justify making a decision that restricts the applicant's right to freedom of speech <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> applicant complains of an alleged infringement of Article 15(1).|$|E
5|$|Interestingly, the funerary {{complex of}} the layer pyramid shows {{no trace of}} an {{enclosure}} wall, which is present in both earlier and later pyramid complexes. This could be because the stones constituting the wall were robbed over time, or <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> wall was never started, being usually the last element of the pyramid complex to be built.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E

5|$|Rights of {{the poor}} was another area that was {{expanded}} by the ACLU. In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system, and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals. The ACLU {{played a key role}} in the 1968 King v. Smith decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could not be denied by a state <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> mother cohabited with a boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{victories}} in the 1930s cemented the ACLUs campaign to promote free speech. In Stromberg v. California, decided in 1931, the Supreme Court sided with the ACLU and affirmed {{the right of a}} communist party member to salute a communist flag. The result {{was the first time the}} Supreme Court used the Due Process Clause of the 14th amendment to subject states to the requirements of the First Amendment. In Near v. Minnesota, also decided in 1931, the Supreme Court ruled that states may not exercise prior restraint and prevent a newspaper from publishing, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> newspaper had a reputation for being scandalous.|$|E
5|$|Stringer also struggles, {{having been}} cut off by Avon's drug {{suppliers}} and left with increasingly poor-quality product. He again goes behind Avon's back, giving up half of Avon's most prized territory to a rival named Proposition Joe {{in exchange for a}} share of his supply. Avon, unaware of the arrangement, assumes that Joe and other dealers are moving into his territory <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Barksdale organization has too few enforcers. He contracts a feared assassin named Brother Mouzone. Stringer deals with this by tricking his old adversary Omar into believing that Mouzone was responsible for the vicious killing of his partner in their feud in season one. Seeking revenge, Omar shoots Mouzone but, realizing Stringer has lied to him, calls 9-1-1. Mouzone recovers and leaves Baltimore, and Stringer (now with Avon's consent) is able to continue his arrangement with Proposition Joe.|$|E

50|$|Prader-Willi {{syndrome}} is often misdiagnosed as other syndromes due {{to many in}} the medical community's unfamiliarity with PWS. Sometimes it is misdiagnosed as Down syndrome, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> relative frequency of Down syndrome compared to PWS.|$|R
5|$|Wrecking Racing {{was meant}} to enable {{a broad range of}} strategies, such as keeping up but {{watching}} out for destruction opportunities, destroying the cars in front, and destroying everything without concern for position. This was hard to balance, but it proved possible to win with each of those strategies. Edmondson came up with Stock Car Racing after watching the Banger World Finals at Arena Essex and noticing that there were some cars simply racing rather than trying to destroy each other. The normal race mode was implemented <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> engine could support running a traditional race. For Destruction Derby mode, more varied arenas were implemented {{to take advantage of a}} new physics system developed by Reflections. Edmondson decided against implementing features such as speed boosts and collectibles because he did not want the game to feel like an arcade game and wanted the car physics to be as realistic as possible. Destruction Derby 2 was released on the PlayStation in 1996, and a PC version soon followed. The next instalment in the Destruction Derby series, Destruction Derby Raw, was released in 2000.|$|E

50|$|Even today, {{marketing}} {{is seen by}} many a CEO as a post-manufacturing activity, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> all <b>the</b> elements (packaging, branding, distribution, selling, advertising, sales promotion), take place usually after the basic product is made.

25|$|A {{survey in}} the United States {{of more than}} 10,000 {{physicians}} came to the result that while 24% of physicians would prescribe a treatment that is a placebo <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> patient wanted treatment, 58% would not, and for the remaining 18%, it {{would depend on the}} circumstances.|$|E
25|$|When {{speed limits}} are arbitrary, {{such as when}} set through {{political}} rather than empirical processes, the speed limit's relationship to the maximum safe speed is weakened or intentionally eliminated. Therefore, a crash can be counted as speed-related even if it occurs at a safe speed, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> speed was in excess of a politically determined limit.|$|E
25|$|Even many {{of those}} who never {{received}} a deferment or exemption never served, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> pool of eligible men was so huge compared to the number required for service, that the draft boards never got around to drafting them when a new crop of men became available (until 1969) or because they had high lottery numbers (1970 and later).|$|E
50|$|One of his {{earliest}} suspended mobiles, McCausland Mobile (1933), {{is different from}} many other contemporary mobiles <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> shapes of the two objects.

25|$|Many {{different}} factors {{combine to}} influence levels of utility cycling. In developing economies, {{a large amount}} of utility cycling may be seen <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> bicycle is the most affordable form of vehicular transport available to many people. In richer countries, where people can have the choice of a mixture of transport types, a complex interplay of other factors influences the level of bicycle use.|$|E
25|$|Verdi made {{a number}} of cuts in 1866, after {{finishing}} the opera but before composing the ballet, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> work was becoming too long. These were a duet for Elisabeth and Eboli in Act 4, Scene 1; a duet for Carlos and the King after the death of Posa in Act 4, Scene 2; and an exchange between Elisabeth and Eboli during the insurrection in the same scene.|$|E
25|$|They {{discouraged}} the alum mining near Volterra in Italy, apparently pushing {{its inhabitants}} to revolt against Florentine rule. At Lorenzo's direction, the insurrection was brutally suppressed. The mines reduced output safely under Florentine (and thus, Medici) control. The sad {{outcome of this}} episode was that the sack was entirely unnecessary: exploitation of this mine was abandoned in 1483 <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> mine was so poor that it was unprofitable.|$|E

50|$|In Western Christian art, {{the fruit}} of the tree is {{commonly}} depicted as the apple, which originated in central Asia. This depiction may have originated as a Latin pun: by eating the mālum (apple), Eve contracted malum (evil).

25|$|The US Army had {{considered}} {{the issue of}} ballistic missile defense (BMD) as early as late in World War II, {{but a series of}} studies on the topic suggested attacking a V-2 rocket would be difficult <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> flight time was so short that it would leave little time to forward information through command and control networks. Bell Labs pointed out that although longer-range missiles flew much faster, their longer flight times would address the timing issue and their very high altitudes would make long-range detection easier.|$|E
25|$|The {{second issue}} confronting the Court was the effect which {{inflation}} {{had on the}} sale price of the property. The Court flatly refused to overturn the contract on grounds of equity <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> assessed value had exceeded the anticipated rate of inflation. The parties had considered the effect inflation might have, and had agreed on the terms. No objection had been raised at any time by either party prior to agreement, and the contract was (as Field previously noted) fair. But the Court also recognized that forcing Tayloe to accept paper currency valued at one-half that of coin would also be unjust.|$|E
25|$|The {{organic acids}} are mainly malic and tartaric acids. Tartaric acid is a {{characteristic}} of grapes; in its leaves its content ranges from 5 to 7 grams per litre. Malic acid is present in green grapes and its ratio decreases with maturation to give between 2 and 7 grams per litre at harvest. The range is very wide depending on the variety and soil with hot climates giving lower rates as the heat accelerates its degradation. There are many other acids in small quantities: citric acid, ascorbic acid, α-ketoglutaric, fumaric acid, galacturonic acid, coumaric acid, etc. Their variable quantity varies the pH of the wort. The must of white wine is generally more acidic than red grape must <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> grape maturity is less advanced.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "color charge" [...] of quarks and gluons is {{completely}} {{unrelated to the}} everyday meaning of color.
