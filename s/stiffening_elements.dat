They enhance the bending {{resistance of the}} plate {{to allow it to}} carry local wheel loads and distribute those loads to main girders. They also increase the total cross-sectional area of steel in the plate, which can increase its contribution to the overall bending capacity of the deck (i.e. the deck plate acts as a top flange in a box or I beam girder). Finally, the stiffeners increase the resistance of the plate to buckling.|$|E

50|$|Homaxinella balfourensis is {{attached}} to the substrate by roots and has creeping stolons. It is usually arborescent with a main trunk and a dichotomous branching habit of growth but can also be clavate, thickening upwards like a club. The lower branches are stout and cylindrical while the upper branches are soft and spongy and are sometimes clavate themselves. It can grow to a length of 50 cm with flattened branches up to 10 cm long and 0.8 cm wide. The surface of the sponge is smooth and ranges in colour from white, cream or orange to light grey. The silicaceous <b>stiffening</b> <b>elements</b> in the sponge's skeleton are called spicules, and the type and shape of these plays an important part in the identification of sponges. Homaxinella balfourensis has an axially condensed, choanosomal skeleton of spicules with an extra-axial skeleton of bundles of larger spicules known as megascleres. These come in various sizes but all are of the type known as styles, with one end pointed and the other end rounded. There are also a large number of randomly arranged, disconnected styles. There are no microscleres.|$|E
40|$|This brief note {{discusses}} {{a change}} to the effective width determination for elements with intermediate stiffeners (e. g., the compression flange of deck sections) in local buckling. Current provisions (Section B 5. 1. 1 of AISI-S 100 - 07) can lead to erroneously conservative solutions, particularly for sections with a single stiffener located at mid-width of the element. The problem is easily rectified by using the more general expressions for local buckling already available in Specification section B 5. 1. 2. A ballot has been proposed to remedy the problem. The AISI Specification provisions for determining the effective width of elements with intermediate stiffeners have undergone significant revisions in recent editions. In 2001 entirely new provisions were adopted for stiffened and edge <b>stiffened</b> <b>elements</b> with multiple intermediate stiffeners {{based on the work}} of Schafer and Peköz (1998). In 2007 the provisions for single intermediate stiffeners were removed and the 2001 multiple intermediate stiffener provisions expanded to cover both single and multiple intermediate stiffeners in stiffened and edge <b>stiffened</b> <b>elements</b> {{based on the work of}} Yang and Schafer (2006). The basic basis of the current intermediate stiffener provisions is the determination of (a) plate sub-element local buckling, and (b) distortional buckling of the intermediately <b>stiffened</b> <b>element</b> as illustrated in the AISI commentary, reprinted here as Fig. 1. Once the plate buckling coefficient (i. e., the “k ” value) is determined for each of the modes, the smaller of the two is selected for effective width determination...|$|R

5000|$|In this method, the {{exterior}} {{surface of the}} fuselage is also the primary structure. A typical early form of this (see the Lockheed Vega) was built using molded plywood, where the layers of plywood are formed over a [...] "plug" [...] or within a mold. A later form of this structure uses fiberglass cloth impregnated with polyester or epoxy resin, instead of plywood, as the skin. A simple form of this used in some amateur-built aircraft uses rigid expanded foam plastic as the core, with a fiberglass covering, eliminating the necessity of fabricating molds, but requiring more effort in finishing (see the Rutan VariEze). An example of a larger molded plywood aircraft is the de Havilland Mosquito fighter/light bomber of World War II.No plywood-skin fuselage is truly monocoque, since <b>stiffening</b> <b>elements</b> are incorporated into the structure to carry concentrated loads that would otherwise buckle the thin skin.The use of molded fiberglass using negative ("female") molds (which give a nearly finished product) is prevalent in the series production of many modern sailplanes.

50|$|The {{equation}} for {{the equilibrium}} of cylindrical shells introduced by Donneli in NACA Report No. 479 {{to find the}} critical stresses of cylinders in torsion is applied to find critical stresses for cylinders with simply supported edges under other loading conditions. It is shown that by this method solutions may be easily obtained, with results {{expressed in terms of}} two nondimenslonal parameters, one dependent on the critical stress and the other essentially determined by the geometry of the cylinder. The influence of boundary conditions related to edge displacements in the shell median surface is discussed. The accuracy of thesolutions found is established by comparing them with previous theoretical solutions and with test results. The solution to a number of problems concerned with buckling of cylinders with simply supported edges {{on the basis of a}} unified viewpoint are presented in a convenient form for practical use.The continuing emphasis on aircraft designed for very high speed has resulted in a trend toward thicker skin and fewer <b>stiffening</b> <b>elements.</b> As a result, more of the aerodynamic load is being carried by the skin, and thus ability to predict accurately the behavior of thin molded sheets under load has become more important. Accordingly, it was considered desirable to provide the designer with more information on the buckling of curved sheet than has been available in the past. In carrying out a theoretical research program for this purpose, a method of analysis was developed which is believed to be simpler to apply than those generally appearing in the literature. The specific problems solved as a part of this research program are treated in detail in other papers. The purpose of the present investigation, which is discussed in two papers, is to present the method of analysis that was developed to solve these problems. In the present paper the method is briefly outlined and applied to a number of the simpler problems in the buckling of cylindrical shells.

40|$|An {{inflatable}} {{structural system}} to deploy a space system {{such as a}} solar shield, an antenna or another similar instrument requires a <b>stiffening</b> <b>element</b> after it is extended by the inflated gas pressure. The <b>stiffening</b> <b>element</b> has to be packaged in folded configuration before the deployment. It must be relatively small, lightweight, non-damaging to the inflated system {{and be able to}} become stiff in a short time. One stiffening method is to use a flexible material inserted in the deployable system, which, upon a temperature curing, can become stiff and is capable of supporting the entire structure. There are two conditions during the space operations when the inflated volume could be damaged: during the transonic region of the launch phase and when the curing of the rigidizing element occurs. In both cases, an excess of pressure within the volume containing the rigid element could burst the walls of the low-pressure gas inflated portion of the system. This paper investigates those two conditions and indicates the vents, which will prevent those damaging overpressures. Vent openings at the non-inflated volumes have been calculated for the conditions existing during the launch. Those vents allow the initially folded volume to exhaust the trapped atmospheric gas at approximately the same rate as the ambient pressure drops. That will prevent pressure gradients across the container walls which otherwise could be as high as 14. 7 psi. The other condition occurring during the curing of the <b>stiffening</b> <b>element</b> has been investigated. This has required the testing of the element to obtain the gas generation during the curing and the transformation from a pliable material to a rigid on The tested material is a composite graphite/epoxy weave.

The test provided the mass of gas evolved during the test. That data, including the chemical nature of the evolved gas, provided the data for the calculation of the pressure produced within the volume.

The AISC W-section is selected as the geometry for the comparisons. The local cross-section stability of all W-sections in the AISC Manual is assessed using finite strip analysis and compared with plate buckling solutions in common use. Significant web-flange interaction in local buckling is observed in the majority of sections. The design strength formulas for a locally slender W-section column performed by the AISC Q-factor approach, AISI Effective Width Method, and AISI Direct Strength Method are all provided in a common set of notation. The role of cross-section stability in the prediction equations is highlighted. The potential to use cross-section stability solutions for local stability instead of plate buckling solutions is investigated.

In the work described in this thesis, the use of <b>stiffening</b> <b>elements</b> to decrease low-frequency noise transmission through lightweight panels was explored. The effect of elastic mounting as a possible contributor to low-frequency noise transmission was also considered. A finite element model allowing for both panel stiffening from clamping {{and the addition of}} variable-stiffness beams within the panel was constructed. The model allows for variable positioning of such elements as part of a stiffened panel configuration. Several double-panel configurations, representing double-pane windows typically seen in energy-efficient constructions were also tested with various clamped-stiffening elements.

In addition to the FEM and Rayleigh-Ritz models, experimental sound transmission loss testing of panels with variable edge stiffness was performed to verify the character of the predictions seen in the models.

40|$|A {{finite element}} {{analysis}} of laminated shells reinforced with laminated stiffeners is described in this paper. A rectangular laminated anisotropic shallow thin shell finite element of 48 d. o. f. is {{used in conjunction with}} a laminated anisotropic curved beam and shell <b>stiffening</b> finite <b>element</b> having 16 d. o. f. Compatibility between the shell and the stiffener is maintained all along their junction line. Some problems of symmetrically stiff ened isotropic plates and shells have been solved to evaluate the performance of the present method. Behaviour of an eccentrically stiffened laminated cantilever cylindrical shell has been predicted to show the ability of the present program. General shells amenable to rectangular meshes can also be solved in a similar manner...|$|R
