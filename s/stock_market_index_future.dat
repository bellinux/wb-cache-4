40|$|During a few intense {{minutes on}} May 6, 2010, major equity indices {{in both the}} US futures and {{securities}} markets plummeted 5 - 6 % before rebounding almost as quickly.

Regulatory agencies have shown that the flash crash was triggered by a large, automated sell-off in a <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>index</b> <b>futures</b> contract called E-mini S&P. The crash was made worse by high frequency trading firms first driving up trading volume and then suddenly withdrawing from markets when market data started to show anomalies. A key lesson risk managers can draw from the crash is to make sure their firms have clear routines for reviewing the reliability of market data and handling large, short-term increases in uncertainty.

5000|$|Former Federal Reserve Board member Robert Heller, in the Wall Street Journal, {{opined that}} [...] "Instead of {{flooding}} the entire economy with liquidity, and thereby increasing {{the danger of}} inflation, the Fed could support the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> directly by buying market averages in the futures market, thereby stabilizing the market as a whole." [...] His statement {{has been used to}} claim that the Fed actually did act in that way. Some mainstream analysts call those claims a conspiracy theory, explaining that such claims are simplistic and unworkable. Author Kevin Phillips wrote in his 2008 book Bad Money that while he had no interest [...] "in becoming a conspiracy investigator", he nevertheless drew the conclusion that [...] "some kind of high-level decision seems to have been reached in Washington to loosely institutionalize a rescue mechanism for the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> akin to that pursued...to safeguard major U.S. banks from exposure to domestic and foreign loan and currency crises."

40|$|We empirically {{analyze the}} scaling {{properties}} of daily Foreign Exchange rates, <b>Stock</b> <b>Market</b> <b>indices</b> and Bond <b>futures</b> across different financial markets. We study the scaling behaviour {{of the time}} series by using a generalized Hurst exponent approach. We verify the robustness of this approach and we compare the results with the scaling properties in the frequency-domain. We find evidence of deviations from the pure Brownian motion behavior. We show that these deviations are associated with characteristics of the specific markets and they can be, therefore, used to distinguish the different degrees of development of the markets. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} between the Mib 30 <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>index</b> and its <b>future</b> contract are examined. Using daily data for the 1994 – 2002 period, {{it is found that}} the cost-of-carry model holds as an equilibrium relationship between spot and futures prices. Deviations from equilibrium are corrected by movements in the spot market, but cross-market dynamics are also important in the short run. We model the time varying volatility of daily returns’ as an autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic process; this model used to estimate minimum-variance hedge ratios. In- and out-ofsample comparisons with static hedging show that, by carefully choosing the ARCH specification, a significant improvement in variance reduction can be achieved...|$|R

Using dynamic panel techniques to analyze panel data from 18 developed and 18 emerging markets, we find a positive and significant relationship between bank stock returns and future GDP growth that is independent of the previously documented relationship between <b>market</b> <b>index</b> returns and economic growth. We also find {{that much of the}} informational content of bank stock returns is captured by country-specific and institutional characteristics, such as bank-accounting-disclosure standards, banking crises, enforcement of insider trading law and government ownership of banks. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We derive {{equilibrium}} {{restrictions on}} {{the range of the}} transaction prices of American options on the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>index</b> and <b>index</b> <b>futures.</b> Trading over the lifetime of the options is accounted for, in contrast to earlier single-period results. The bounds on the reservation purchase price of American puts and the reservation write price of American calls are tight. We allow the market to be incomplete and imperfect due to the presence of proportional transaction costs in trading the underlying security and due to bid-ask spreads in option prices. The bounds may be derived for any given probability distribution of the return of the underlying security and admit price jumps and stochastic volatility. We assume {{that at least some of}} the traders maximize a time- separable utility function. The bounds are derived by applying the weak notion of stochastic dominance and are independent of a trader’s particular utility function and initial portfolio position. 1...|$|R
40|$|In the {{business}} sector, {{it has always}} been a difficult task to predict the exact daily price of the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> index; hence, {{there is a great deal}} of research being conducted regarding the prediction of the direction of stock price index movement. Many factors such as political events, general economic conditions, and traders' expectations may have an influence on the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>index.</b> There are numerous research studies that use similar indicators to forecast the direction of the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>index.</b> In this study, we compare two basic types of input variables to predict the direction of the daily <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>index.</b> The main contribution of this study is the ability to predict the direction of the next day's price of the Japanese <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>index</b> by using an optimized artificial neural network (ANN) model. To improve the prediction accuracy of the trend of the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>index</b> in the <b>future,</b> we optimize the ANN model using genetic algorithms (GA). We demonstrate and verify the predictability of stock price direction by using the hybrid GA-ANN model and then compare the performance with prior studies.

40|$|Commodities {{are back}} {{following}} a stellar run of price performance, attracting financial investor attention. What are the fundamental reasons to hold commodities? One {{reason is the}} exposure offered to underlying risk factors. In this paper, I assess the macro risk exposure offered by commodity futures and test whether these risks are priced, using Merton''s (1973) intertemporal capital asset pricing model for a sample of commodity prices covering the period January 1973 - February 2008. I find that commodity futures offer a hedge against lower interest rates and that investors {{are willing to accept}} lower expected returns for this position. Although some commodities are also a hedge against U. S. dollar depreciation, this risk is not priced.

40|$|We {{provide an}} {{explanation}} for the explosive growth in the popularity of Stock <b>Index</b> <b>Futures</b> contracts. In our economy there are three broad classes of traders that place orders with a competitive market maker that sets a bid-ask spread arising from adverse selection. Informed traders trade {{on the basis of their}} private information about the value of particular securities. Liquidity traders trade either specific stocks, or wish to trade diversified portfolios. We show that the Stock Index is the efficient trading vehicle for this last class of traders, who abandon the spot securities markets with consequences for the liquidity of individual stocks. The reason is that the costs faced by diversified traders will be lower in the <b>Index</b> <b>market</b> than in <b>markets</b> for individual <b>stocks,</b> because any idiosyncratic information flowing in the <b>Index</b> <b>market</b> is substantially lower than that brought by insiders to the spot <b>market.</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Index</b> <b>Futures</b> contracts are, therefore, convenient innovations for financial institutions that trade large portfolios of securities to match the liquidity needs of their clients. We predict that the innovation of index contracts adversely affects the liquidity of individual stocks. Trading in the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> becomes more costly for those traders whose strategies involve the purchase or sale of specific securities...|$|R
