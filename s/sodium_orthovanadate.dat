MethodsConfluent cultures of bovine corneal epithelial cells were treated with different concentrations of general phosphate inhibitors andsodium orthovanadate for varying periods. An MTS assay was used to confirm no cellular death under the treatment profile. Immunocytochemical (ICC) analysis was performed to demonstrate protein tyrosine phosphorylation after treatment with <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate,</b> {{and the effect of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate</b> on junctional proteins such as p 120, α-catenin, occludin, ZO- 1, and ZO- 2. Western blot analysis was used to analyze the changes in p 120, α-catenin, occludin, ZO- 1, and ZO- 2 after treatment. Paracellular permeability was evaluated by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). ResultsDuring the whole course of treatment, no significant cellular death was noticed. Dose- and time-dependent effects of <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate</b> on protein tyrosine phosphorylation were confirmed by ICC. ICC also demonstrated the dose- and time-dependent effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate</b> on the disruption of p 120, α-catenin, occludin, ZO- 1, and ZO- 2.

We found that, in vitro, dexamethasone inhibits both preosteoblast proliferation and mitogenic kinase activity in response to mitogens, and that inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) using <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate</b> prevents this. Therefore, dexamethasone may act by either upregulating antiproliferative PTPs or downregulating promitogenic tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates. In this study, osteoporosis was induced in 3. 5 -month-old rats by subcutaneous injection with methylprednisolone 3. 5 mg/kg per day for 9 weeks. Rats were treated with steroid alone or in combination with 0. 5 mg/mL <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate,</b> administered continuously in drinking water. Steroid-treated bones were significantly (p < 0. 005) osteopenic (according to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and physically weaker (p < 0. 05) than controls.

40|$|The pars tensa of {{the tympanic}} {{membrane}} is composed of three layers: an epidermal layer, a fibrous layer, and a mucosal layer. Recent studies (Kuijpers et al, 1999; Henson and Henson, 2000; Henson et al, 2005) suggest that the fibrous layer in several mammalian species contains contractile fibers, which are located primarily within the thickened border of the pars tensa known as the annulus fibrosis. These contractile fibers resemble smooth muscle fibers. Yang and Henson (2002) studied the physiological effects of pharmacological modulators on the pars tensa of the annulus fibrosis by measuring the sound-induced cochlear response. Their results suggest a dose-dependent change in cochlear response after application of <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate</b> and norepinephrine. Application of saline induced no change in cochlear response. Based on their data, Yang and Henson proposed that the pharmacological agents altered {{the function of the}} smooth muscle fibers of the annulus fibrosis to produce a mechanical change in {{the tympanic membrane}}. In this study two measurements, cochlear response and Laser Doppler Vibrometry, were used to assess the sound-induced velocity of the tympanic membrane of the gerbil before and after application of saline and varying concentrations of three smooth muscle antagonists (<b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate,</b> norepinephrine, and carbachol) to the pars tensa. It was demonstrated that applications of saline and varying concentrations of <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate</b> were associated with both increases and decreases in the magnitude of the cochlear response in two out of three ears tested. There was no evidence of a dose-dependent change in the cochlear response. (cont.) Applications of saline and varying concentrations of <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate,</b> norepinephrine, and carbachol were associated with increases and decreases in the magnitude of the Laser Doppler Vibrometry response in eight of fourteen ears tested.

40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) exerts a {{positive}} effect on the transcription of genes coding for several extracellular matrix-related products, including collagen I. We have previously identified a strong TGF-beta 1 -responsive element (TbRE) in the upstream promoter sequence of the alpha 2 (I) collagen (COL 1 A 2) gene. Our experiments have shown that TGF-beta 1 stimulates COL 1 A 2 transcription by increasing binding of an Sp 1 -containing complex (TbRC) to the TbRE. They have also suggested that the change occurs via posttranslational modification of a protein(s) directly or indirectly interacting with Sp 1. Here, we provide evidence showing that tyrosine dephosphorylation of nuclear proteins mimics the stimulation of COL 1 A 2 transcription by the TGF-beta 1 -activated signaling pathway. Preincubation of nuclear extracts with protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) but not with protein phosphatase type 2 A (PP 2 A), a serine/threonine phosphatase, enhanced binding of the TbRC to the same degree as culturing cells in TGF-beta 1. Consistent with these in vitro findings, genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, led to markedly increased COL 1 A 2 gene expression, whereas <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate,</b> a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, decreased it substantially. These results were supported by transfection experiments showing that genistein and <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate</b> have opposite effects on TbRE-mediated transcription. Moreover, nuclear proteins isolated from genistein-treated cells were found to interact with the TbRE significantly more than those from untreated cells. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate</b> virtually abrogated nuclear protein binding to the TbRE, but not to a neighboring cis-acting element unresponsive to TGF-beta 1. The results of this study, therefore, provide the first correlation between tyrosine dephosphorylation, increased binding of a transcriptional complex, and TGF-beta 1 stimulation of gene expression...|$|E

At physiological pH 7. 4, in 25 mImage sodium phosphate buffer, addition of the synthetic thiol, dithioerythritol (DTE) results in a marked increase of NADH oxidation {{in the presence}} of <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate,</b> but not {{in the presence of}} vanadyl sulfate. Other reductants, such as dithiothreitol and cysteine, can also increase NADH oxidation, whereas glutathione and ascorbate cannot. In all reactions, superoxide dismutase and catalase completely inhibit the vanadium-stimulated oxidation of NADH. Inhibition occurs in a concentration-dependent manner, and the boiled enzymes do not inhibit the thiol reaction. The hydroxyl radical scavenger, thiourea, inhibits the reaction, whereas urea cannot. ESR studies show that the ability of the thiol to reduce vanadate can be correlated with the degree of NADH oxidation. Using spin trapping techniques, hydroxyl radicals are detected {{during the course of the}} reaction. Addition of hydrogen peroxide to vanadyl in the presence of DTE greatly increases NADH oxidation; however, no NADH oxidation occurs when hydrogen peroxide is added to vanadyl and ascorbic acid.

The present study was conducted to examine the role of tyrosine kinases in the norepinephrine-induced vascular smooth mus-cle contraction of isolated aortae from two-kidney, one clip (2 K 1 C) hypertensive rats. Materials and Methods： 2 K 1 C hypertension was made by clipping the left renal artery of the rats, with age-matched rats receiving a sham treatment serving as controls. Thoracic aortae denuded of endothelium were mounted in tissue baths to measure the isometric tension. Results：The putative tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and tyrphostin 25, significa-ntly inhibited the contractile responses of the aorta to norepinephrine in the control rats, but not in the 2 K 1 C rats. The protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate,</b> selectively potentiated the contractile response to norepinephrine, but only in the controls.

The <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate</b> increases the level of the fructose- 2, 6 -biophosphate and kinase activity of PFK- 2 /FBP- 2 in the liver tissue and hepatocytes obtained from diabetic rats. The obtained data promote {{to the development of the}} new antidiabetic preparations on base of the vanadium-containing compounds.

40|$|Previously {{we found}} that {{interleukin}} 2 (IL- 2) induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the serine/threonine-specific kinase encoded by the raf- 1 protooncogene in a T-cell line, CTLL- 2. Here we extended these findings by exploring the effects of selective removal of phosphate from tyrosines in p 72 - 74 -Raf- 1 kinase that had been immunoprecipitated from IL- 2 -stimulated CTLL- 2 cells. Treatment in vitro of IL- 2 -activated Raf- 1 with the tyrosine-specific phosphatases CD 45 and TCPTP (formerly called T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase) reduced Raf kinase activity to nearly baseline levels. This effect was completely inhibited by the phosphatase inhibitor <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate.</b> In contrast, treatment of Raf- 1 with a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase, protein phosphatase 1 (PP- 1), resulted in a more modest decrease in Raf in vitro kinase activity, and this effect was prevented by okadaic acid. Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed the selective removal of phosphate from tyrosine by CD 45 and from serine and threonine by PP- 1. The immunoreactivity of p 72 - 74 -Raf- 1 with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies was also completely abolished by treatment with CD 45 in the absence {{but not in the}} presence of <b>sodium</b> <b>orthovanadate.</b> These findings provide evidence that the IL- 2 -stimulated phosphorylation of Raf- 1 on tyrosines {{plays an important role in}} upregulating the activity of this serine/threonine-specific kinase in CTLL- 2 cells and, as such, provides a model system for studying the transfer of growth factor-initiated signals from protein tyrosine kinases to serine/threonine-specific kinases...|$|E
