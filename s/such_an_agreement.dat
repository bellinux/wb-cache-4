5|$|After the Dutch {{had driven}} the Swedish out of Butre, the {{director}} general of the Dutch West India Company, with headquarters in St. George d'Elmina in the central Gold Coast, decided that it would be beneficial to negotiate a treaty with the local political leadership in order to establish a peaceful long-term relationship. The Ahanta leaders found it equally beneficial to enter into <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement.</b> The 1656 treaty signalled the definitive switch in European jurisdiction in the area until 1872.|$|E
5|$|The Whitestone Branch {{would have}} had to be rebuilt if it were leased to the subway, with {{railroad}} crossings removed and the single track doubled. The PSC located 14 places where crossings needed to be eliminated. However, by early 1917, there was barely enough money to build the subway to Flushing, let alone a link to Whitestone and Bayside. A lease agreement was announced on October 16, 1917, but the IRT withdrew from the agreement a month later, citing that it was inappropriate to enter <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> at that time. Thereafter, the PSC instead turned its attention back to the Main Street subway extension.|$|E
5|$|The few {{courts that}} have {{considered}} the antitrust implications of concurrent use registration have determined {{that it does not}} raise any violation of antitrust laws. Although it is considered a violation of such laws for companies to agree to divide up geographic territories for the sale of goods, concurrent use agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E

5|$|Most {{concurrent}} use proceedings {{result in a}} legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its {{concurrent use}} claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> is that the parties can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely to result from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E
5|$|The {{negotiations}} were inaugurated on 15 July 1963 at the Kremlin with Khrushchev in attendance. Khrushchev reiterated that the Anglo-American inspection plan {{would amount to}} espionage, effectively dismissing {{the possibility of a}} comprehensive ban. Following the script of his 3 July 1963 speech, Khrushchev did not demand a simultaneous moratorium on underground testing and instead proposed a non-aggression pact. Under instruction from Washington, Harriman replied that the US would explore the possibility of a non-aggression pact in good faith, but indicated that while a test ban could be quickly completed, a non-aggression pact would require lengthy discussions. Additionally, such a pact would complicate the issue of Western access to West Berlin. Harriman also took the opportunity to propose a non-proliferation agreement with would bar the transfer of nuclear weapons between countries. Khrushchev said that <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> should be considered in the future, but in the interim, a test ban would have the same effect on limiting proliferation.|$|E
5|$|Pius II {{continued}} to support Skanderbeg, {{but did not}} provide him as much financial aid as Calixtus had since he believed that Skanderbeg's military skill and his soldiers' aptitude for battle were enough {{to hold back the}} Turkish armies. However, the pope still considered Skanderbeg's assistance essential for his plans for an anti-Ottoman crusade. In 1459, after Mehmed II completed his conquest of Serbia, Ottoman envoys appealed for a three-year armistice between Skanderbeg's Albania and the Ottoman Empire. The sultan's purpose was to distance Skanderbeg from the pope's crusade as he believed the crusade's only hope for success was Skanderbeg. In order to give Albania a break from fifteen years of continuous Ottoman invasion, Skanderbeg considered accepting the proposal but he had to get the pope's approval. Pius did not allow <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> and began to doubt Skanderbeg's loyalty. As the Ottomans were operating in the Western Balkans, Pius feared that the Ottoman soldiers would break the truce and pour into Albania. In order to regain the pope's trust, Skanderbeg did not agree to the peace. Skanderbeg, nevertheless, was disappointed by Rome's response and he responded by not participating in the Council of Mantua which was held to plan the future crusade. The Council ended in failure, signifying that Skanderbeg would receive no help from the West. He thus sent ambassadors to the pope saying that he would only be willing to land in Italy if a ceasefire with the Turks were arranged, something which Rome soon allowed.|$|E

25|$|Senate {{procedure}} depends {{not only}} on the rules, but also on a variety of customs and traditions. The Senate commonly waives some of its stricter rules by unanimous consent. Unanimous consent agreements are typically negotiated beforehand by party leaders. A senator may block <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement,</b> but in practice, objections are rare. The presiding officer enforces the rules of the Senate, and may warn members who deviate from them. The presiding officer sometimes uses the gavel of the Senate to maintain order.|$|E
25|$|Where a {{subordination}} agreement {{places a}} later mortgage in higher priority than one previously granted, {{the validity of}} releases granted by the previous mortgagors will {{have a significant impact}} on the priority assigned to each of the secured debts in question.

25|$|Despite the {{establishment}} of <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> with the British, Nasser's position remained tenuous. The loss of Egypt's claim to Sudan, coupled with the continued presence of Britain at Suez for a further two years, led to domestic unrest including an assassination attempt against him in October 1954. The tenuous nature of Nasser's rule caused him to believe that neither his regime, nor Egypt's independence would be safe until Egypt had established itself {{as head of the}} Arab world. This would manifest itself in the challenging of British Middle Eastern interests throughout 1955.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch {{government}} in The Hague made several attempts {{to reach an}} agreement with the Republic of Indonesia.

Under the auspices of the Security Council of the United Nations an agreement was achieved in May 1949 to hold a Round Table Conference in The Hague in order to prepare the transfer of sovereignty. Beel made efforts to thwart the agreement. However he was unsuccessful and he resigned from his Office of High Commissioner of the Crown.|$|E
25|$|Consensus (ijma) {{could in}} {{principle}} elevate a ruling based on probable evidence to absolute certainty. This classical doctrine drew its authority {{from a series}} of hadiths stating that the Islamic community could never agree on an error. This form of consensus was technically defined as agreement of all competent jurists in any particular generation, acting as representatives of the community. However, the practical difficulty of obtaining and ascertaining <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> meant that it had little impact on legal development. A more pragmatic form of consensus, which could be determined by consulting works of prominent jurists, was used to confirm a ruling so that it could not be reopened for further discussion. The cases for which there was a consensus account for less than 1 percent of the body of classical jurisprudence.|$|E

25|$|In June 2015, {{the state}} {{government}} agreed to renew the 421-a tax abatement program, extending it for another four years. The state increased the affordability requirement from 20% to 25-30%. However, the state extended the program conditionally. Specifically, the state set a requirement that workers and development workers {{come to an agreement}} on whether workers on 421-a construction projects would be paid union-level wages, something that developers stated would increase construction costs drastically. The city's Independent Budget Office estimated that the union-level wages requirement would increase the cost of Mayor Bill de Blasio's affordable housing plan by $2.8 billion. The extension of the program would be voided if <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> on union-level wages was not reached by January 15, 2016. Advocates of not renewing the program claimed that the program unfairly benefited real estate developers {{at the expense of the}} New York City taxpayer; the funds for the program essentially came from the New York City government. Because an agreement was not reached by the deadline, the 421-a program expired in New York on January 15, 2016.|$|E
25|$|From this position, Michener angered Diefenbaker by {{allowing}} the loyal opposition a great degree of latitude during Question Period, {{so much so that}} at one point, on May 25, 1959, Diefenbaker became so flustered that he refused to sit down when called to order by Michener. Actions like these, among others, impressed parliamentary observers and a group of university professors initiated a campaign to make Michener's position as speaker permanent; they proposed that, as is the tradition with the Speaker of the British House of Commons, Michener run as an independent in general elections and that the political parties agree not to run candidates against him. <b>Such</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement,</b> however, failed to materialize, and when Michener ran for re-election in the 1962 race, he was defeated. This was the first time since 1867 that a speaker had lost his riding in an election in which his party formed the government. After Diefenbaker declined to advise the Governor General to summon Michener to the Senate, the latter returned to Toronto and dedicated his time to his law practice, Lang Michener LLP.|$|E
25|$|After {{hearing about}} the incident, the Douglas County sheriff Samuel L. Jones journeyed to Hickory Point to investigate. Jones was a pro-slavery {{advocate}} and so he let Coleman go free while he arrested Dow's affiliate, Jacob Branson, for disturbing the peace. Branson, however, was eventually rescued by Free-Staters, causing the pro-slavery faction to seethe with anger. Within a matter of days, {{the governor of the}} Kansas Territory, Wilson Shannon, called for the Kansas militia to settle the issue, but this resulted in a small army of 1,500 Missourians entering Kansas. The group, led by Jones, made their way to Lawrence, prepared to eradicate the free-staters. Meanwhile, the citizens of Lawrence, bracing for the impending battle, raised up a militia of 800 men. Dr. Charles Robinson was commander-in-chief of the city's troops, and the future state senator James Lane was appointed as his second-in-command. The citizens of Lawrence were also aided by the abolitionist John Brown and his sons. However, the Missourians never attacked, and the Lawrencians and the Missourians were encouraged by the governor to sign a peace treaty. <b>Such</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> was finally made in December of 1855, and eventually the Missouri army reluctantly left the area.|$|E
