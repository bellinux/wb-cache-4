5|$|Eric and Leslie Ludy {{met when}} Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a {{friendship}} {{for several months}} before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but {{to wait for the}} life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool {{in the creation of the}} reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contained}} several {{scenes that}} were reminiscent of past episodes of the series. The shot in which Jim and Dwight survey {{the office was}} filmed {{to be similar to}} a scene that featured Dwight and Michael in the third season installment [...] "Gay Witch Hunt". In addition, Dwight pulling Angela over was filmed in a way that recalled the sixth season episode [...] "The Delivery". Although the scene wherein Jim gives advice to Dwight was shot in a similar manner to Jim's farewell to Michael in the seventh season episode [...] "Goodbye, Michael", it was not intentionally <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> it, according to Rogers. In addition, the obstacle course was not a direct reference to the second season episode [...] "Office Olympics", although Rogers understood that there were similarities.|$|E

The gimmick was created for Konnan, but Konnan left the WWF after a backstage disagreement. Since Diamond fit the costume, he was chosen {{to take over the}} character. The suit was a very elaborate powder blue bodysuit with markings that were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a circuit board and white protruding rings around his arms making him look rather [...] "outlandish". The elaborate outfit also came with two wrist devices that shot out fireworks and a jet pack that was supposed to make Max Moon look like a man of the future.|$|E

Between the mail-ing of that issue and the writing of this one, yet another “missing link ” {{has been reported in}} the scientific and popular media. The April 26, 2001 issue of Nature contained an article on a newly announced “feathered dinosaur” from China that supposedly represents the missing link between reptiles and birds. The May 7, 2001 issue of Time presented—with great flourish—an artist’s concept of what the crea-ture is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> You will find our comments on this new discovery in the section of our article titled “The Quest Continues. ”...|$|R
2500|$|... 10-for-200: Also {{known as}} Bidding A Flight or Wheels. Bidding 10-for-200 commits a side {{to win at}} least 10 tricks; if successful, the team scores 200 points. If the side wins fewer than 10 tricks, they lose 200 points. Some play a lost bid only loses 100, not 200. In some variations, to make a 10-for-200 bid, the side must win exactly 10 tricks. If a team pulls more than 10 the extra tricks are still bags or [...] "ob's" [...] Some play that any bid of 10 is {{automatically}} a 10-for-200 bid. In some places the 10-for-200 bid is called 10-for-2, which is written on the score sheet as 10-4-2. Another way of writing the 200 score is with the two zeros linked together at the top; this is called Wheels, as the zeroes are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> train wheels. Making this bid is also significant in that the other team is automatically set if Nils are not allowed, since they would not even make Board, thus the winning team will be ahead by at least 240 points (200 for the score + 40 point penalty of the other team).|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Doesn't Really Matter", Jackson {{speaks of}} looking past {{physical}} appearance, choosing {{to love the}} person inside. Using a vocal falsetto, Jackson assures [...] " [...] doesn’t really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm {{in love with the}} inner being," [...] considered a [...] "sweet song of unconditional love." [...] Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said [...] "It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> – all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, {{is the most important thing}} as well as being happy with who you are." [...] The song is based on Jackson's character Denise's [...] "unconditional love" [...] for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, [...] "I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that – how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him. [...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside." [...] Jimmy Jam added, [...] "It lyrically goes with her character in the movie. The song is about 'it's what's inside that counts.' You think it's funny when you hear that Janet and Klump have a relationship, but they make it believable." ...|$|E

5000|$|The book {{generated}} {{some controversy}} because [...] "society is {{not accustomed to}} seeing beauty in young males", Greer claims. Greer has described the book as [...] "full of pictures of 'ravishing' pre-adult boys with hairless chests, wide-apart legs and slim waists". She {{goes on to say}} that, [...] "I know that the only people who are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> at pictures of boys are a subgroup of gay men," [...] she wrote in London's Daily Telegraph. [...] "Well, I'd like to reclaim for women the right to appreciate the short-lived beauty of boys, real boys, not simpering 30-year-olds with shaved chests." [...] She was criticized for these comments with some writers labeling her a paedophile.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, a {{comprehensive}} reconstruction was undertaken in the Wendish church. In order to gain more space, two-storey galleries were inserted. The previously flat roof, which inhibited the galleries, was replaced with a barrel vault. Because the galleries blocked the access of light into the church, a half-rounded window was made where the altar now stands. At the same time, a new organ from the Kaltschmidt firm in Stettin was added. The old pulpit, which is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have <b>looked</b> more <b>like</b> a barrel, made way for a pulpit altar which was crowned with a cross. There were originally quotes from the Bible in a predella to both sides of the pulpit, but these were painted over later.|$|R
5000|$|The Kit Car, made {{in honor}} of NASCAR legend Richard Petty, was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> as much <b>like</b> a race car as possible. The wheels had no hubcaps, the wheel opening flares had a bolted on look, and even the {{windshield}} had metal tie downs just like the race cars. Unlike a race car, the Kit Car came standard with an automatic transmission. A special addition was a decal kit with large door mountable [...] "43" [...] decals and 360 decals for the hood. These decals were shipped in the trunk either to be installed by the dealer or by the owner. Most people however, left them in the trunk. It only came in one color - a special two-tone red. The Kit Car {{would prove to be}} one of the rarest Aspens ever built, as only 145 were ever built.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{response}} to a personal problem I have with modern day bathrooms. The bathroom is a room we frequent daily, yet it is often times the room with the least visual interest. The design of a bathroom is no small task; it has many parameters that need to be addressed. One must consider the functional aspects as well as the practicality of the bathroom. Yet its aesthetics must not be overlooked. As a furniture designer and a craftsman I decided to challenge myself with the task of designing a bathroom. The goal was to create a unique setting for a bathroom, that evoked a positive emotional response from the user The sterile environment often found in today 2 ̆ 7 s bathrooms is not welcoming. Most rooms in a home are decorated to express the inhabitant 2 ̆ 7 s personal style. When decorating a house, close attention is paid to rooms such as living rooms and dining rooms, yet the bathroom, which is frequented more often than either of these rooms, tends to have a generic look. In The Essential Home Book, Getting Back To Basics, Terence Conran states, 2 ̆ 2 Until the move towards more hygienic surfaces {{at the turn of the}} century, people tended to furnish their bathrooms much like other rooms in the house, with bathroom fixtures treated like pieces of furniture, often encased in fine dark woods such as mahogany. With the drive against dirt, the bathroom became rather less hospitable, with hard tiled surfaces and free-standing white cast-iron bathtubs. 2 ̆ 21 Through my extensive research I 2 ̆ 7 ve come across several designers and architects who would tend to agree with my thoughts on this matter. They have attempted, as I have with this thesis, to challenge the conventional concept of what a bathroom is <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> The designs I 2 ̆ 7 ve come across through my research range from the exotic to the minimalist. It seems everybody has their own view on what the ideal bathroom should <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> My ideal bathroom would be one which I could spend time in, forgetting the everyday worries and pressures of the outside world. A place of contemplation and privacy, where one can collect one 2 ̆ 7 s thoughts before starting their day and recapitulate them at the end of the day. The visual statement I chose to communicate in my design is one of comfort, elegance and serenity. Before delving into the design of this bathroom, it is important <b>to</b> take a <b>look</b> at the history of the bathroom and its role in human history. In view of the fact that what we consider a bathroom has only been in existence since the early 19 th century. This will help us understand why the bathroom came to be what it is today...|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in 2001, Takara first {{released}} new Blythe dolls sporadically, {{but then}} began releasing new versions of Blythe each month. Under the creative direction of Junko Wong, CWC has produced 207 of the Neo Blythes, 211 of Petites, and 17 {{of the newest}} addition to the Blythe line, the Middie Blythe dolls. Every one of these Blythes were exhibited at Parco Factory at the 10th Anniversary from June-July 2011. Newer releases of the Petit Blythe dolls have [...] "sleepy eyes" [...] and bendable bodies. The Middies' heads tilt and their eyes look left and right without changing color. The bodies of the full-size dolls {{vary depending on the}} time of the release. Early releases in 2001-2002 used the body of the Licca doll. In June 2002, in commemoration of 1 year of Blythe releases by Takara/CWC, the doll Miss Anniversary was released featuring the [...] "Excellent Body" [...] that was quite similar to the original Blythe released by Kenner. Early dolls also had a glossy surface texture, but some had matte face too. The earliest face molds of the reproduction Blythe dolls are referred to as BL. Two more face molds followed the BL mold, the Excellent mold, or EBL, and the Superior mold, or SBL, in 2003. In 2006 a new face mold, the Radiant mold or RBL, was introduced <b>to</b> <b>look</b> more Kenner-like, including slightly wider eyes. In 2009 another new face mold, the Fairest mold or FBL, was released with matte texture and smaller eye holes. The BL and EBL mold are actually the same mold. The difference in the EBL mold were important internal changes to make the eye mechanism more resistant. In 2013, due to wearing in the Radiance mold, or RBL, a new mold called Radiance+, or RBL+, was released and it's <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> exactly <b>like</b> the Radiance mold. Some changes were made in the eye mechanism as well, it became a lot lighter and easier to change the eyes compared to older releases.|$|R
5000|$|The {{strengths}} of larger breweries, {{combined with a}} flat growth rate in the beer market, played {{a large role in}} the demise of Walter. The major national brewers—which used advertising, their economies of size, and an efficient national distribution system—essentially traded the same customers with other national brewers and grew at the expense of smaller breweries, whose dwindling market share ultimately led to bankruptcy and closure in all but a handful of cases. Through expansive and expensive advertising campaigns, the national brewers were able to convince American beer drinkers that what they were offering was what beer was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> and taste <b>like.</b> However, an increasing number of consumers complained of a taste profile bordering on blandness. Unable to spend any money on advertising/promotion, Walter increasingly opted for discount pricing in an effort to sell more beer, joining in the failing footsteps of many small local brewers that attempted to create sales volume with low prices. They found that their products acquired a lasting reputation for lower quality, thereby harming sales still further. At the same time, Walter failed to recognize a critically important change taking place as consumer tastes were moving toward more flavorful, stylistically distinctive brews, demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} only true growth in the industry at the time was exhibited by the imported beer segment. As the 1980s progressed, the key to survival for small brewers lay in recognizing and catering to this change in consumer demand, and in turn offering products that the national brewers did not produce and could not make in limited quantities. As Healy noted at the time, “A small brewer cannot compete with the big guys on their terms. We came in with plans to do something different, and everyone welcomed us with open arms.” [...] Unfortunately, under Walter's management, which had continued to try to compete with the national brewers by offering identical-looking, nondescript-tasting adjunct beers, no thought was given to producing all-malt products. The firm made only lager beers, and its entire product mix contained not a single ale.|$|R
