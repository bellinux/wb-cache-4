Bearing temperature, torque, vibration, noise, strain, cage speed, etc., were monitored to establish those measurements most suitable as indicators of ball bearing health. Tape records were made under steady-state conditions of a variety of speeds and loads. Sample sections were selected for narrowband spectral analysis with a real time analyzer. An artificial flow was created across the inner race surface of one bearing using an acid etch technique to produce the <b>scratch.</b> <b>Tape</b> records obtained before and after established a characteristic frequency response that identifies the presence of the flow. The signals found most useful as indicators of performance degradation were ultrasonic outputs...|$|E

40|$|Laser-induced surface {{modification}} of different polymers {{is presented as}} a suitable pretreatment of surfaces in a two-step metallization process. Materials such as polyamide (PA), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene(PS), polycarbonate (PC), acrylbutadienestyrene (ABS), styreneacrylnitrile (SAN), polybutadieneterehthalate (PBT), and polyoxymethylene (POM) were treated by excimer-laser radiation a 248 nm in air. The aim the study is to investigate different processing regimes of {{surface modification}} and ablation to increase surface roughness. Therefore, the laser-processing variables fluence F, repetion rate v and pulse number N are varied and the ablation depth, optical penetration depth, absorption coefficient and ablation threshold are determined. The metallization of pretreated (laser, wet chemical and plasma etching) polymers is investigated for different surface morphologies. The used metallization processes were electroplating and physical vapour deposition (PVD). The adhesion of the deposited films is measured with <b>scratch</b> and <b>tape</b> test methods {{in order to determine the}} regimes of suitable surface modification for metallization...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{infrequently}} measured but essential {{properties for}} thin-film (T-F) module reliability are the interlayer adhesion and cohesion within a layer. These can be cell contact layers to glass, contact layers to the semiconductor, encapsulant to cell, glass, or backsheet, etc. We use an Instron mechanical testing unit to measure peel strengths at 90 {sup o} or 180 {sup o} and, in some cases, a <b>scratch</b> and <b>tape</b> pull test to evaluate inter-cell layer adhesion strengths. We present peel strength data for test specimens laminated {{from the three}} T-F technologies, before and after damp heat, and in one instance at elevated temperatures. On laminated T-F cell samples, failure can occur uniformly at {{any one of the}} many interfaces, or non-uniformly across the peel area at more than one interface. Some peel strengths are 10 N/mm. We measure a wide range of adhesion strengths and suggest that adhesion measured under higher temperature and relative humidity conditions is more relevant for module reliability...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} a screen printable piezoelectric paste formulated from a blend of PZT-Pz 29 powders of different mean particle size mixed in an organic vehicle. In order to enhance d 33 properties of the thick-film (a piezoelectric coefficient), no binder material was mixed into the paste. The d 33 coefficient and maximum applied electrical field of devices processed at peak temperatures of 150 ºC, 200 ºC, 750 ºC, 850 ºC and 1000 ºC were measured and the film adhesion assessed using <b>scratch</b> and <b>tape</b> tests. The applications that would benefit from these enhanced properties are also discussed. The thick-films produced at these processing temperatures showed good adhesion to 96 % alumina substrates. They also showed the ability to withstand high electrical fields and a significant enhancement in d 33 when compared to thick-film materials processed at similar temperatures using polymer or glass binders. A maximum average d 33 value of 168 pCN- 1 was obtained for samples processed at a peak temperature of 1000 ºC. This is 28 % higher than the reported d 33 value for a conventional piezoelectric thick-film processed at the same temperature. All samples withstood electric field strengths of over 14 MVm- 1 which is between 2. 5 to 4. 5 times higher than that used for conventional piezoelectric thick-films...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} restoring video images taken from scratched 2 -inch video tape. Because {{of the way that}} the video tracks are laid down, a <b>scratch</b> along this <b>tape</b> causes severe degradation. The paper adopts a detect and repair strategy, the detection being accomplished automatically with a rank order model-based approach that makes use of the EM algorithm. The detection is improved by exploiting the known periodicity of the degradation artefacts. Results demonstrate the method's improved preservation of image features over previous methods, while retaining a high percentage of correct detections. 1 Introduction By the early 1970 s a type of video tape recorder that read a 2 -inch (50. 80 mm) wide tape using transversal scanning was employed by most TV broadcasting organisations, including the BBC. This system dominated TV production at the time, although helical scanning is the method used these days. For reasons which will be given later, the video sequences from [...] ...|$|R
40|$|My {{abstract}} {{moving image}} making {{has provided a}} foundation for my practice since I first started processing and solarizing my own 16 mm film {{in one of those}} LOMO Russian processing tanks in 1973. Feyers, Zoomfilm (1976) and Running (1976) rework some of those early strips of black and white film. Whenever funding dried up I always fell back on my abstract direct on film work. It was cheap. Like knitting, it gave me a space to process the dilemmas and incongruities of daily life and to escape its clutches. I also began to understand that these forces were still there, embedded implicitly in the work. Now, more than ever, I understand this as a survival response to corporate doublespeak. I would never throw anything away. New <b>scratching,</b> painting, <b>taping</b> or bleaching strategies could be added later. Intensive cluster editing of single frames became an obsession. The translated difference between what you saw over a light-box and what was projected drew me in. Like the migrant position I was allocated from childhood I survived in the space between these two territories. As well as an archive of images and movement I collect optical effects. The flash frame. The trail of afterimages resulting from flickering between positive and negative images. At their liveliest these images float above the screen. Now the digital allows me to amplify the material presence of 16 m and 35 mm film and a whole new world opens up before me. I cobble together found footage films from my own archive of discarded data and unfinished sentences...|$|R
40|$|The {{scratch test}} method {{is widely used}} for {{adhesion}} evaluation of thin films and coatings. Usual critical load criteria designed for scratch testing of coatings were not applicable to thin atomic layer deposition (ALD) films on silicon wafers. Thus, the bases for critical load evaluation were established and the critical loads suitable for ALD coating adhesion evaluation on silicon wafers were determined in this paper as LCSi 1, LCSi 2, LCALD 1, and LCALD 2, representing the failure points of the silicon substrate and the coating delamination points of the ALD coating. The adhesion performance of the ALD Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, TiN, and TaCNþRu coatings with a thickness range between 20 and 600 nm and deposition temperature between 30 and 410 C on silicon wafers was investigated. In addition, {{the impact of the}} annealing process after deposition on adhesion was evaluated for selected cases. The tests carried out using <b>scratch</b> and Scotch <b>tape</b> test showed that the coating deposition and annealing temperature, thickness of the coating, and surface pretreatments of the Si wafer {{had an impact on the}} adhesion performance of the ALD coatings on the silicon wafer. There was also an improved load carrying capacity due to Al 2 O 3, the magnitude of which depended on the coating thickness and the deposition temperature. The tape tests were carried out for selected coatings as a comparison. The results show that the scratch test is a useful and applicable tool for adhesion evaluation of ALD coatings, even when carried out for thin (20 nm thick) coatings...|$|R
3000|$|We {{report the}} {{activation}} energy, ΔEa, for the quantum yield in thermally assisted photoelectron emission (TAPE) under 210 -nm-wavelength light irradiation, {{and the associated}} X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results. Samples were cleaned only in acetone and scratched in air, water, methanol, ethanol, acetone, benzene, and cyclohexane. Glow curves, describing the temperature dependence of photoelectron emission (PE) quantum yield (emitted electrons/photon), Y, were obtained. A simple method of determining ΔEa using Y, called Y GC, at seven temperatures up to 353 °C, for the same Y glow curve, was proposed. The ΔEa obtained using this method was almost {{the same as that}} obtained from Y for seven stationary temperatures (Y ST [...]). For <b>scratched</b> samples, the <b>TAPE</b> was measured over two cycles of temperature increase and subsequent decrease (Up 1, Down 1 and Up 2, Down 2 scans) in the 25 – 339 °C range, and ΔEa was obtained from Y GC [...]. The Arrhenius plot was approximated by a straight line, although a convex swelling peak appeared in the Up 1 scan. ΔEaUp 1 was in the 0.212 – 0.035 eV range, depending on the environment in which scratching was performed; ΔEaUp 1 for water was much higher than that for acetone. This was explained in terms of the mode of the acid–base interaction between the liquid molecules and the hydroxyl group of Fe–OH. The values of ΔEaDown 1, ΔEaUp 1, and ΔEaDown 2 were in the 0.038 – 0.012 eV range. The total count of electrons emitted during the Up 1 and Up 2 scans was found to decrease with increasing ΔEaDown 1 and ΔEaDown 2, respectively. ΔEaUp 2 was found to increase with increasing presence of the FeO component in the analyzed Fe oxides. The convex swelling peak was attributed to the removal of carbon materials from the scratched surface and the effect of the increased electron density of the surface hydroxyl group of FeOH under the light irradiation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Infinite time Turing {{machines}} {{with only one}} tape are in many respects fully as powerful as their multi-tape cousins. In particular, the two models of machine give rise to the same class of decidable sets, the same degree structure and, at least for functions f. R → N, the same class of computable functions. Nevertheless, there are infinite time computable functions f: R → R that are not one-tape computable, and so the two models of infinitary computation are not equivalent. Surprisingly, the class of one-tape computable functions is not closed under composition; but closing it under composition yields the full class of all infinite time computable functions. Finally, every ordinal which is clockable by an infinite time Turing machine is clockable by a one-tape machine, except certain isolated ordinals that end gaps in the clockable ordinals. Infinite time Turing machines, introduced in [HamLew∞a], extend the usual operation of Turing machines into transfinite ordinal time. By doing so, they provide a model for supertask computations, computations involving infinitely many steps, {{and set the stage}} for a mathematical analysis of what is possible in principle to achieve via supertasks. For example, it is easy to see that every arithmetic set is decidable by such machines; a bit more sophistication reveals that every Π 1 1 set and more is supertask decidable. A rich degree structure has emerged on the class of reals and sets of reals, stratified by two natural jump operators. For this and more analysis we refer the reader to the small but rapidly growing body of literature on the subject: [HamLew∞a], [HamLew∞b], [Wel∞a], [Wel∞b] and [Wel 98]. Let us review how the machines work. Using a three-tape Turing machine model, with separate input, <b>scratch</b> and output <b>tapes,</b> an infinite time Turing machine progresses through the successor stages of computation just as an ordinary Turing machine does, according to the rigid instructions of a finite program running wit...|$|R
