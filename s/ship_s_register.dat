Survey results also indicated that hospitals use diverse resources and approaches to provide information services to {{a wide array of}} health care providers and consumers. These baseline data, combined with an assessment of key environmental factors affecting hospitals, can provide guidance to hospital libraries as they face the challenges of the 1990 s.
