40|$|Sea lamprey (Petromyzon Marinus) is a {{parasitic}} {{species that}} have affected Great Lakes fisheries in many ways. Control of seal lamprey populations through binational efforts started in 1950 s and continues today. The primary technique {{used to control}} sea lamprey is the application of lampricides to streams to kill larvae before they become parasites. The Great Lakes Fishery Commission is looking for an alternative method of control to complement lampricides to reduce sea lamprey abundance. Trapping adult sea lamprey as they migrate upstream is used for assessment of spawining population in the <b>stream.</b> <b>Trapping</b> efficiency needs to be improved before this method {{could be used as}} an alternative method of control. Thus, the understanidng of sea lamprey behavior at traps is important to try to improve trap success. A male mating pheromone component (3 kPZS) used as an attractant in traps has been shown to increase trap capture. Also, other external factors are likely to affect the behavior of sea lamprey at traps. Video was used to record sea lamprey behavior at five traps across five migration seasons, with one trap being baited with 3 kPZS. I found sea lamprey are 31 % more likely to enter after approaching the trap when it was baited with pheromone.

30|$|The abundances of the mayfly Ephemera danica reached {{relevant}} numbers only on {{the later}} sampling dates of the study (day 35 – 57), but apparently depended on the test concentration (Fig.  6 d). No individuals {{were found in the}} stream treated with 120  µg/L during the whole study {{and at the end of}} the study, but also in the lowest test concentration the abundance was lower than per average in the controls. Thus, this mayfly is perhaps more sensitive than Gammarus sp. In laboratory studies with sediment, the 96  h-LC 50 of carbaryl for E. danica was 153  µg/L [13]. This result suggests no effects to be expected for E. danica in the lower carbaryl concentrations in this study. However, it is not clear if the dissipation was similar and which stages of larvae were tested. E. Danica is a semivoltine organism and the life cycle can last from 1 to 3  years. During the first sampling dates in July and August, the larvae of the newly hatched generation are very small, which makes it difficult to detect them during these months [53, 54]. Younger organisms are usually more sensitive than older and larger organisms, for example because the higher surface to volume ratio results in higher uptake rates. Thus, effects on survival of the very young but sensitive larvae might have been overlooked in our study and became only visible when the survivors were larger and detected in the samples later in the study. Similar observations were also made in a stream mesocosm study by Beketov et al. [42] on long-term effects of the insecticide thiacloprid, where the stonefly larvae Nemoura cinerea and the mayfly larvae Ephemera vulgata were only found in control streams 27  weeks after application. Because of the fact that on every macroinvertebrate sampling day two <b>stream</b> biota A <b>traps</b> were removed from every stream mesocosm (with exception of stones and remaining leaf material), potential habitats for E. danica and other taxa were reduced and more concentrated on the remaining <b>stream</b> biota <b>traps</b> with every following sampling day.

The DPF’s main function is to trap particulate matter (soot) from the exhaust <b>stream.</b> The <b>trapped</b> soot is removed by regeneration of the filter. The regeneration process involves soot oxidation via oxygen and nitrogen dioxide. Simulations on kinetics and pressure drop are widely used in the assessment of the DPF.

40|$|Reserve {{corridors}} {{in production}} forestry landscapes are frequently concentrated in riparian areas. This study describes the numerical response of ground-dwelling beetles to increasing distance from streams, {{with the aim}} of evaluating the effectiveness of such a bias in reserve allocation. Patterns in abundance and diversity of epigaeic beetles were quantified at four first order streams in wet eucalypt forest in Tasmania, Australia. The depth and pattern of beetles' riparian response varied between <b>streams.</b> Commonly <b>trapped</b> beetles were less abundant near to three of the four streams, and the numerical response model differed in each case. Species richness of common beetles was also lower near one of the streams. Pooled abundance and richness of rare species did not vary in response to the riparian-upslope transition. No riparian or upslope specialist species were identified among the most commonly collected species. Compared to upslope habitat, the riparian-upslope transition encompassed greater variability in species composition without actually increasing overall richness. The study findings demonstrate the need for ecosystem-specific data to optimize reserve placement, since the results were not predicted from general vegetation patterns, ecological theory, or the widely held assumption that riparian areas support greater abundance and diversity of organisms than adjacent upslope areas. Reserves encompassing more upslope habitat are recommended to complement those located in riparian areas...|$|R
40|$|Retention of coarse {{particulate}} {{organic matter}} (CPOM) in streams is affected by channel com-plexity, especially three-dimensional structures in stream channels. Much attention has focused on woody debris as retention structures, but macrophytes should function similarly. Retention and flow characteristics were measured in 5 m long reaches at four-replicate sites in the Breitenbach (Hessen, Germany). CPOM retention was measured by releasing chips of paper (6 mm diameter) as analog CPOM. Triplicate releases (200 chips each) were done before and after submerged, emergent and overhanging macrophytes were removed. Discharge ranged between 3 and 4. 5 l s− 1 during the experimental releases. Macrophyte biomass removed was 3. 047, 3. 012, 0. 164, and 1. 392 kg m− 2 (fresh weight) respectively from sites 1 to 4. Instantaneous retention rates, calculated with an ex-ponential decay function, were significantly higher (P < 0. 001) with macrophytes than without macrophytes (0. 8 ± 0. 2 versus 0. 2 ± 0. 1). Velocity also was significantly reduced by macrophyte presence (P < 0. 001). Macrophyte biomass {{was a significant predictor}} of retention (P < 0. 001), whereas discharge was not (P = 0. 3).

Additional <b>trapping</b> was also undertaken in the South Esk River and farm dams. Sites were trapped during late spring/mid summer and early autumn. A total of 78 individuals were caught in the study area. Platypuses were caught at all sites trapped in the second-fourth order and fifth order stream reaches and in nine of the twenty first order streams. Catch success was greatest in the fifth order stream reach and lowest in the first order streams. There was a trend toward a higher proportion of juvenile/subadult males in the lower order stream sites. For the higher stream orders, a higher proportion of individuals was caught during the summer, however for the first order streams, a higher proportion was caught during the autumn trapping period. Information collected on the body mass, body length and condition of individuals indicated smaller individuals with a higher tail fat index in the lower order streams. There was a trend toward a lower occurrence of platypuses in the first order streams, which had been disturbed 15 years previously by forestry operations compared to first order streams with relatively undisturbed catchments. Differences in occurrence of platypuses were related to differences in the 'in-stream' and riparian characteristics of disturbed streams compared to undisturbed streams. Headwater streams form a large proportion of a river system. Although they provide more marginal habitat for the platypus than larger river reaches, their disturbance may be an important land management issue in the conservation of this species, particularly in river catchments where the species is impacted by other environmental changes or disease...|$|R

The following development is proposed: given that there exist eastward or westward longitudinal gradients in the geomagnetic field resulting from distortion of the geomagnetic field by solar <b>streams,</b> if the <b>trapped</b> radiation is adiabatic in character, radial drift separation {{of positive and negative}} charged particles must occur. It follows that, for bounded or irregular distributions of plasma number density in such an adiabatic - drift region, electric fields will arise.

An adiabatic acceleration mechanism is described, which is based on incorporating the electrostatic energy of the particle in the energy function for the particle. Direct consequences of polarization of the geomagnetically trapped radiation will be the polar electrojet current systems and the polar aurora...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA multidirectional cage trap (MDC-Trap) was {{developed}} {{in order to assess}} small-scale directional movements of benthic invertebrates in <b>streams.</b> The <b>trap</b> can be operated with causing minimal disturbance to the stream bed and enables repeated sampling of identical patches of stream bottom. The MDC-Trap combines characteristics of net samplers with features of colonization-substrate samplers. It is made out of a perforated plywood box which is divided into nine compartments. Each compartment is loaded with a gravel-filled directional cage that can be colonized from one direction only. The modular design of the MDC-Trap allows assessing of up to nine different types of invertebrate movement simultaneously: upstream, downstream and lateral on the substrate surface as well as subsurface movements upstream, downstream and lateral. If necessary, distinctions can be made between left and right oriented movements. Furthermore, movements vertically upward from within the hyporheos can be recorded. The MDC-Trap was designed to be used in streams with coarse sand, gravel or pebble substrates. The device is constructed so that there is no clogging and, once exposed, the trap can be left in the stream indefinitely. The results of first field tests show that the MDC-Trap is suitable to characterize small-scale movements of invertebrates in gravel streams. Net longitudinal movement was in the downstream direction for most species, although the taxon-specific patterns varied considerably. In particular, Baetis rhodani and Hydropsyche spp. exhibited a clear preference for downstream movement by drifting or crawling and seldom displayed upstream or lateral movement. Preference for downstream movement was less pronounced for chironomids, Eucyclops serrulatus and Gammarus pulex. Other taxa were about equally distributed among the direction-sensitive subunits. No taxon exhibited large-scale upstream movement. These findings are in contrast to the idea of compensatory migrations...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a three-dimensional spatially evolving compressible mixing layer is investigated numerically using a parallel implementation of Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) on a Cray C- 90. The parallel implementation allowed the flow to be highly resolved while significantly reducing the wall-clock runtime. A sustained computation rate of 5. 3 Gigaflops including I/O was obtained for a typical production run on a 16 processor machine. A novel mixing layer configuration is investigated where a pressure mismatch is maintained between the two inlet streams. In addition, the sonic character of the two streams is sufficiently different so that the pressure relief wave is trapped in the high speed <b>stream.</b> The <b>trapped</b> wave forces the mixing layer to form a characteristic cellular pattern. The cellular structure introduces curvature into the mixing layer that excites centrifugal instabilities characterized by large-scale counter-rotating vortical pairs embedded within the mixing layer. These are the dominant feature of the flow. Visualizations of these structures in cross-section show the pumping action which lifts dense fluid up into light gas. This effect has a strong impact on mixing enhancement as monitored by a conserved scalar formulation. Once the large-scale structures axe well established in the flow and undergo intensification from favorable velocity gradients, the time-averaged integrated product shows almost a four-fold increase. A spectral analysis of the flow-field over the cellular structures, {{as part of a}} full space-time analysis, shows these structures to be zero-frequency modes that develop from low level essentially broad-banded noise. This characterization of the vortical structures and their appearance is consistent with a recent linear stability analysis, of a mixing layer over a curved wall that predicts the most unstable modes to be zero frequency streamwise vortices...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasound-driven {{oscillating}} micro-bubbles {{have been}} used as active actuators in microfluidic devices to perform manifold tasks such as mixing, sorting and manipulation of microparticles. A common configuration consists on side-bubbles, created by trapping air pockets in blind channels perpendicular to the main channel direction. This configuration consists of acoustically excited bubbles with a semi-cylindrical shape that generate significant streaming flow. Due to the geometry of the channels, such flows have been generally considered as quasi two-dimensional. Similar assumptions are often made in many other microfluidic systems based on flat micro-channels. However, in this paper we show that microparticle trajectories actually present a much richer behavior, with particularly strong out-of-plane dynamics in regions close to the microbubble interface. Using Astigmatism Particle Tracking Velocimetry, we reveal that the apparent planar streamlines are actually projections of a streamsurface with a pseudo-toroidal shape. We therefore show that acoustic streaming cannot generally be assumed as a two-dimensional phenomenon in confined systems.

40|$|The Goukou Wetland is a 700 ha unchannelled {{valley bottom}} wetland {{near the town}} of Riversdale in the Western Cape of South Africa. The wetland is {{approximately}} 16 km long and between 200 and 800 m wide, with peat deposits up to 8 m deep that get progressively shallower downstream. The Goukou Wetland {{is one of the last}} remaining intact peatlands of significant size in the Western Cape. However, there is increasing human pressure on these peat wetlands, where the dominant plant is palmiet (Prionium serratum), which is endemic to the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces of South Africa. Palmiet is viewed as a problem plant by farmers as it is believed to block waterways and promote inundation of arable land and infrastructure. Many landowners therefore actively remove palmiet from peatlands, threatening the integrity of these wetlands. Although the hydrogeomorphic origin of large, non-peat floodplain and valley bottom wetlands has been investigated in South Africa, unchannelled valley-bottom wetlands with deep peat accumulations are rare features and have not been well studied. The hydrogeomorphic factors leading to peat accumulation have been documented elsewhere in Southern Africa, where aggradation due to sedimentation along trunk streams may block a tributary stream, elevating the local base level of the tributary, creating the accommodation space for organic sedimentation. Alternatively, sedimentation along a trunk stream at the toe of a tributary stream may similarly block a trunk stream, promoting organic sedimentation along the trunk stream upstream of the tributary. This pattern of peat accumulation is associated with declining peat thickness upstream of the blocked valley. In the case of the Goukou Wetland, however, peat depth and organic content was found to increase consistently upstream from the toe to the head of the wetland. The Goukou Wetland was graded along its length, with gradient increasing consistently upstream in response to longitudinal variation in discharge. There was no clear relationship between peat formation and tributary streams blocking the wetland. Instead, the distribution of peat and the extent of the wetland appeared to be controlled by the plant palmiet, whose clonal nature and robust root, rhizome and stem system allowed it to grow from channel banks and islands into fast-flowing river channels, slowing river flows and ultimately blocking the channel. The promotion of diffuse flows within the dense, monospecific stands of palmiet creates conditions conducive to water retention and peat accumulation. By growing across the full width of the valley floor, the plant is able to constrict the <b>stream,</b> <b>trapping</b> sediment and slowing flows such that the fluvial environment is changed from a fast flowing stream to one with slow, diffuse flow. These processes appear to lead to the formation of organic sediment, accumulating to form a deep peat basin. The sustained input of water from the folded and fractured quartzite lithologies of the Cape Supergroup that make up the Langeberg Mountains, which provide the bulk of the water supply to the wetland, is also important in promoting permanent flooding in the wetland. A feature that characterized the wetland was the fact that bedrock across the valley beneath the peat deposits exhibited a remarkably uniform elevation. This suggests that over long periods of time (tens to hundreds of thousands of years), bedrock has been laterally planed across the valley floor. It is proposed that valley widening associated with lateral planning of Uitenhage Formation rocks has taken place during periods of episodic very high flows. During these episodes, erosion cuts into the peat wetland and valley sides, cutting to bedrock and planing the valley floor to a uniform elevation for a given distance from the head of the wetland. Periods of episodic degradation are followed by periods of renewed peat accumulation associated with palmiet establishment, such that the wetland valley is shaped by repeated cycles of cutting and filling. Palmiet can be considered an “ecosystem engineer” that is integral to the formation of these deep peat basins. Removal of palmiet from these systems is likely to have negative consequences for the wetland and its functions in that water storage will be reduced, erosion will increase dramatically, and the water-purification function of the wetlands will be lost. Management of these wetlands, which are close to the geomorphic threshold slopes for their size, is therefore essential if they are to be preserved for the benefit of human well-being...|$|R

The coastal wetlands of California have dwindled in acreage to one-fourth of their former extent. While much of this loss has come from diking, filling, and dredging development, indirect filling from sedimentation is a major problem. With the passage of the California Coastal Act in 1976, the direct filling of wetlands became severely restricted. However, indirect filling is a largely unregulated and ubiquitous problem involving large land areas, many government jurisdictions and all sorts of land uses. What does the sedimentation of coastal marshes have to do with riparian habitats? There is a very direct relationship. The California State Coastal Conservancy through its efforts to restore and preserve coastal wetlands has had to look upstream into watersheds and stream systems to find the sources of sediment and reduce erosion problems. The following two examples demonstrate how the preservation and restoration of riparian systems helps protect coastal marshes and estuaries...|$|R
40|$|Larges {{uncertainties}} {{are attached}} to hazard prediction in mountain streams, because of some limitations in our knowledge of physical processes, and overall, {{because of the lack}} of measurements for validation. This is particularly true for hydrological data, making the hydrology assessment of a mountain river a very difficult task, usually associated with large uncertainties. On the other hand, contrarily to lowland rivers, bed-load in mountain <b>streams</b> is often <b>trapped</b> in mitigation-structures, such as open check dams. This study aims to take advantage of these additional information for compensating the general lack of hydrological data, in order to converge toward a comprehensive diagnosis of the catchment hydrological behavior. A hydrology and sediment transport study has been done on the Roize torrent (16. 1 -km 2 - Voreppe - 38 -FR). After a classical historical study, a regional analysis of raingauges and water-discharge-stations situated in the calcareous north Pre-Alps massifs of the Vercors, Chartreuse and Bauges has been done. A catchment geomorphology study has been performed to get insight about the Roize torrential activity and sediment transport. The volumes of bed-load transported each year on average and during extreme floods have been computed using the estimated hydrology. The good bed-load predictions compare to the volume dredged in the Voreppe sediment trap are considered an indirect validation of the hydrology study...|$|R
40|$|This study, on the {{immature}} {{stages of}} the Simuliidae, was undertaken in streams draining bogs in Upper Teesdale. There were four parts to the investigation: Firstly, a qualitative survey of fourteen sites showed eleven of the thirty-five British species of Simuliids to be present. Secondly, quantitative programmes showed streams to have three types of population structure: those with larvae present mainly in winter; mainly in summer; and throughout the year. Most streams were in the latter two categories, larval numbers being lower in winter at the higher altitudes. In summer 1972, absolute population estimates were obtained from two <b>streams</b> by removal <b>trapping.</b> More larvae occurred in the lower sections of the streams and, in the streams where the winter populations were low, larval numbers were larger early in summer; this was not true of the lower altitude stream. Thirdly, cumulative frequency x size-measurement plots were made on probability paper from which the modal size-classes corresponding to the larval instars of each species could be determined. All species had seven larval instars and percentage frequency distributions for each sampling date were constructed. The detailed population biology could then be determined. Larval life was much shorter in summer at 30 - 40 days than in winter. Two generations were distinguished, that in winter commonly having two cohorts and that in summer often as many as four...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: A {{study to}} {{determine}} the composition of tsetse flies species was conducted between January and December, 2007 in Kamuku National Park, Nigeria, using Biconical and Nitse traps. Tsetse flies were trapped along gallery forest in five <b>streams</b> for two <b>trapping</b> days and were collected daily. Approach: All tsetse flies caught were identified to species level, sexed, separated into teneral and non-teneral, hunger staged and Mean Hunger Stage computed. Fly density were calculated, the age structure examined using wing fray techniques for males and ovarian technique for females; the reproductive status of female flies were assessed. Two species of tsetse flies (Glossina palpalis palpalis robineau-desvoidy and Glossina tachinoides Westwood) were caught in total of five hundred and two (502) flies. Out of these, 309 (61. 6 %) Glossina tachinoides and 193 (38. 4 %) G. palpalis were caught. Male catches (309, 61. 6 %) were significantly (P Results: The estimated mean age for males was 11 days and females were 8 days. The insemination rate of 93. 8 % generally was high, G. tachinoides recorded 95. 5 % more than G. palpalis of 91. 6 %. Whereas parity rate (25. 8 %) was low; G. palpalis was 37. 4 % while G. tachinoides parity rate is 17. 2 %. Conclusion: The study shows that two species of tsetse flies abound in the park although at low densities their presence may bear semblance to Trypanosomiasis and its impact to ecotourism...|$|R
40|$|Coal {{combustion}} by-products {{production in}} USA and EU is estimated in around 115 million tons per year. A {{large portion of}} this production is accounted for the coal fly ash (CFA). Cement and concrete manufacturing consumes most of the CFA produced. Zeolite synthesized from CFA is a minor but interesting product, with high environmental applications. Zeolites may be easily obtained from CFA by relatively cheap and fast conversion processes. This paper provides an overview on the methodologies for zeolite synthesis from CFA, and {{a detailed description of}} conventional alkaline conversion processes, with special emphasis on the experimental conditions to obtain high cation exchange capacity (CEC) zeolites. Zeolitic products having up to 3 meq g− 1 may be easily obtained from high-glass CFA by direct conversion. A review of potential applications of different zeolitic products for waste water and flue gas treatment is also given. The examination of the data presented by different authors reveals that one of the main potential application of this material is the uptake of heavy metals from polluted waste waters. The zeolitic material may be also used for the uptake of ammonium from polluted waters but high concentrations of other cations may considerably reduce the ammonium absorption efficiencies due to ion competition. Some of the zeolites synthesized may be also used as molecular sieves to adsorb water molecules from gas <b>streams</b> or to <b>trap</b> SO 2 and NH 3 from low-water gaseous emissionsPostprint (published version...|$|R
