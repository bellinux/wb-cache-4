5|$|The normal resting {{heart rate}} {{is called the}} <b>sinus</b> <b>rhythm,</b> created and {{sustained}} by the sinoatrial node, a group of pacemaking cells found in {{the wall of the}} right atrium. Cells in the sinoatrial node do this by creating an action potential. The cardiac action potential is created by the movement of specific electrolytes {{into and out of the}} pacemaker cells. The action potential then spreads to nearby cells.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} <b>sinus</b> <b>rhythm</b> of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the heart muscle. This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E

Several spectral characteristics are extracted from the power spectrum density, representing the energy distribution on the time-frequency plane.

After direct current (DC) cardioversion, the patient regained vital signs and defibrillation converted the VT into an accelerated idioventricular rhythm with resolution of the ST-segment elevation. The patient was referred to our hospital for close observation and further evaluation. At our hospital, an ECG showed normal <b>sinus</b> <b>rhythms</b> and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. We diagnosed the patient with variant angina rather than ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), because his clinical manifestations were quite distinct; ST-segment elevations disappeared slowly at the reperfusion stage.

40|$|With tens of {{thousands}} of electrocardiogram (ECG) records processed by mobile cardiac event recorders every day, heart rhythm classification algorithms are an important tool for the continuous monitoring of patients at risk. We utilise an annotated dataset of 12, 186 single-lead ECG recordings to build a diverse ensemble of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that is able to distinguish between normal <b>sinus</b> <b>rhythms,</b> atrial fibrillation, other types of arrhythmia and signals that are too noisy to interpret. In order to ease learning over the temporal dimension, we introduce a novel task formulation that harnesses the natural segmentation of ECG signals into heartbeats to drastically reduce the number of time steps per sequence. Additionally, we extend our RNNs with an attention mechanism that enables us to reason about which heartbeats our RNNs focus on to make their decisions. Through the use of attention, our model maintains a high degree of interpretability, while also achieving state-of-the-art classification performance with an average F 1 score of 0. 79 on an unseen test set (n= 3, 658).

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{an abnormal}} {{rhythm of the}} heart, which can increase heart-related complications. Paroxysmal AF episodes occur intermittently with varying duration. Human-based diagnosis of paroxysmal AF with a longer-term electrocardiogram recording is time-consuming. Here we present a fully automated ensemble model for AF episode detection based on RR-interval time series, applying a novel approach of information-based similarity analysis and ensemble scheme. By mapping RR-interval time series to binary symbolic sequences and comparing the rank-frequency patterns of m-bit words, the dissimilarity between AF and normal <b>sinus</b> <b>rhythms</b> (NSR) were quantified. To achieve high detection specificity and sensitivity, and low variance, a weighted variation of bagging with multiple AF and NSR templates was applied. By performing dissimilarity comparisons between unknown RR-interval time series and multiple templates, paroxysmal AF episodes were detected. Based on our results, optimal AF detection parameters are symbolic word length m = 9 and observation window n = 150, achieving 97. 04 % sensitivity, 97. 96 % specificity, and 97. 78 % overall accuracy. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy vary little despite changes in m and n parameters.

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) and reduced pulmonary function. Subjects and Methods: Eighty-six chronic AF patients who were enrolled from annual health examination programs were studied using echocardiography and pulmonary function tests (PFT). Echocardiography and PFT matched for age, gender, and year performed were selected by the control group who had normal <b>sinus</b> <b>rhythms.</b> Patients with ejection fractions < 50 %, valvular heart disease, or ischemic heart disease were excluded. Results: In the chronic AF patients, the forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1), FEV 1 %, and FEV 1 /forced vital capacity (FVC) were significantly reduced, and the right ventricular systolic pressure was significantly increased. Episodes of heart failure were more frequently associated with the chronic AF patients than the controls. In particular, the FEV 1 % had the most meaningful relationship to chronic AF after an adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors {p= 0. 003, Exp (B) = 0. 978, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 963 - 0. 993 }. Conclusion: Reduced FEV 1 %, which represents the severity of airway obstruction, was associated with chronic AF, and the greater the pulmonary function impairment, the greater the co-existence with AF and congestive heart failure in those with preserved left ventricular systolic function.

40|$|Contemporary {{methods of}} atrial flutter (AFL), atrial {{tachycardia}} (AT), and atrial fibrillation (AF) monitoring, although {{superior to the}} standard 12 -lead ECG and symptom-based monitoring, are unable to accurately discriminate between AF, AFL and AT. Thus, {{there is a need}} to develop accurate, automated, and comprehensive atrial arrhythmia detection algorithms using standard ECG recorders. To this end, we have developed a sensitive and real-time realizable algorithm for accurate AFL and AT detection using any standard electrocardiographic recording. Our novel method for automatic detection of atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia uses a Bayesian approach followed by a high resolution time-frequency spectrum. We find the TQ interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) corresponding to atrial activity by using a particle filter (PF), and analyze the atrial activity with a high resolution time-frequency spectral method: variable frequency complex demodulation (VFCDM). The rationale for using a high-resolution time-frequency algorithm is that our approach tracks the time-varying fundamental frequency of atrial activity, where AT is within 2. 0 - 4. 0 Hz, AFL is within 4. 0 - 5. 3 Hz and NSR is found at frequencies less than 2. 0 Hz. For classifications of AFL (n = 22), AT (n = 10) and normal <b>sinus</b> <b>rhythms</b> (NSR) (n = 29), we found that our approach resulted in accuracies of 0. 89, 0. 87 and 0. 91, respectively; the overall accuracy was 0. 88.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Systems {{providing}} computer-based {{analysis of}} the resting electrocardiogram (ECG) seek {{to improve the quality}} of health care by providing accurate and timely automatic diagnosis of, for example, cardiac rhythm to clinicians. The accuracy of these diagnoses, however, remains questionable. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that (a) 2 independent automated ECG systems have better accuracy in rhythm diagnosis than nonexpert clinicians and (b) both systems provide correct diagnostic suggestions in a large percentage of cases where the diagnosis of nonexpert clinicians is incorrect. METHODS: Five hundred ECGs were manually analyzed by 2 senior experts, 3 nonexpert clinicians, and automatically by 2 automated systems. The accuracy of the nonexpert rhythm statements was compared with the accuracy of each system statement. The proportion of rhythm statements when the clinician's diagnoses were incorrect and the systems instead provided correct diagnosis was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 420 <b>sinus</b> <b>rhythms</b> and 156 rhythm disturbances were recognized by expert reading. Significance of the difference in accuracy between nonexperts and systems was P =. 45 for system A and P =. 11 for system B. The percentage of correct automated diagnoses in cases when the clinician was incorrect was 28 % ± 10 % for system A and 25 % ± 11 % for system B (P =. 09). CONCLUSION: The rhythm diagnoses of automated systems did not reach better average accuracy than those of nonexpert readings. The computer diagnosis of rhythm can be incorrect in cases where the clinicians fail in reaching the correct ECG diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: In this study, our aim is {{to examine}} the role of the {{neutrophil}} to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the predictions of recurrence under long-term follow-up in patients whose <b>sinus</b> <b>rhythms</b> (SRs) were restored with amiodarone in acute atrial fibril-lation (AF). Methods: Retrospectively, patients with acute AF, which successfully converted to the SR with amiodarone treatment, were recruited into the study. Patients experiencing the first AF attack were enrolled to the study and followed up for 5 years (median 23 months, 25 - 75 percentiles 12 - 24 months). Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was computed as absolute neu-trophil count divided by lymphocyte count. Results: A total of 218 patients were recruited into the study and followed up for 21. 6 + 13. 9 months; 87 (40 %) patients had 1 recurrent AF attack within this period. The follow-up of 131 (60 %) patients resulted in persisted SR without any other AF attack. Groups were similar in terms of age and gender. Left atrium (LA) diameter and NLR were increased, and platelet count and lymphocyte count were decreased in patients with AF recurrence in univariate analysis (P <. 05 for all). Only LA diameter (for per mm, 1. 077 [1. 021 - 1. 136], P. 006) and NLR (1. 584 [1. 197 - 2. 095], P. 001) were independent predictors of AF recurrence in the multivariate analysis.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{specific}} problem {{using the}} public access defibrillators (PADs) arises at the railway stations. Some countries as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden are using AC railroad net power-supply system with rated 16. 7 Hz frequency modulated from 15. 69 Hz to 17. 36 Hz. The power supply frequency contaminates the electrocardiogram (ECG). It {{is difficult to}} be suppressed or eliminated {{due to the fact}} that it considerably overlaps the frequency spectra of the ECG. The interference impedes the automated decision of the PADs whether a patient should be (or should not be) shocked. The aim of this study is the suppression of the 16. 7 Hz interference generated by the power supply of the railway systems. Methods Software solution using adaptive filtering method was proposed for 16. 7 Hz interference suppression. The optimal performance of the filter is achieved, embedding a reference channel in the PADs to record the interference. The method was tested with ECGs from AHA database. Results The method was tested with patients of normal <b>sinus</b> <b>rhythms,</b> symptoms of tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Simulated interference with frequency modulation from 15. 69 Hz to 17. 36 Hz changing at a rate of 2 % per second was added to the ECGs, and then processed by the suggested adaptive filtering. The method totally suppresses the noise with no visible distortions of the original signals. Conclusion The proposed adaptive filter for noise suppression generated by the power supply of the railway systems has a simple structure requiring a low level of computational resources, but a good reference signal as well. </p...|$|R
25|$|AF {{is often}} treated with {{medications}} {{to slow the}} heart rate to a near normal range (known as rate control) or to convert the rhythm to normal <b>sinus</b> <b>rhythm</b> (known as rhythm control). Electrical cardioversion {{can also be used}} to convert AF to a normal <b>sinus</b> <b>rhythm</b> and is often used emergently if the person is unstable.
