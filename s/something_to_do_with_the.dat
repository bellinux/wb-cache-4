5|$|On 15 November 2004, Shaftesbury's Nice-based lawyer, Thierry Bensaude {{reported}} him missing, {{after being}} contacted by his girlfriend, Orche. The peer divided {{his time between}} the Riviera and a home in Hove, East Sussex. He had been due to return home on 10 November. After not hearing from Shaftesbury in a week, they remained concerned when he failed {{to return to his}} rented flat in Adelaide Crescent, Hove. Bensaude and Orche both expressed fears for his safety. Shaftesbury had been taking legal action in relation to the theft of some family antiques and artwork. Some friends and acquaintances mentioned that he had complained of money problems, so they surmised that his disappearance may have had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> theft and financial loss.|$|E
5|$|High {{school student}} Alex Browning boards Volée Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates for their senior trip to Paris, France. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition {{that the plane}} will suffer a catastrophic engine failure, causing the plane to explode mid-air and kill {{everyone}} on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics and a fight breaks out between Alex and his rival, Carter Horton. This leads to several passengers being removed from the plane, including Alex; Carter; Alex's best friend, Tod Waggner; Carter's girlfriend, Terry Chaney; teacher Valerie Lewton; and students Billy Hitchcock and Clear Rivers. None of the passengers, except for Clear, believe Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take-off, killing the remaining passengers on board. Afterwards, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, who believe that Alex had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> explosion.|$|E

25|$|By birth Jeanne was {{connected}} to Clan Forbes. The marriage {{seems to have taken}} place a few years before Clan Leslie joined with Clan Gordon in their feud against Clan Forbes. The Leslie's were supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots, Catholic pretender to the throne of England, who was imprisoned (and eventually executed) by Queen Elizabeth I and her son, the future James I of England, taken away to be raised protestant. These events {{may or may not have}} <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> later accusations that Thomas was an intelligencer for James I.|$|E

He was then forty-three years old, and his previous printed productions had been comparatively trivial, though much of his work was handed about in manuscript long before it was regularly published.|$|E

25|$|In December 2006, two Nithari {{residents}} {{claimed they}} knew {{the location of the}} remains of children who had gone missing in the previous two years: the municipal water tank behind house D5. Both had daughters who were missing, and they suspected Surinder Koli, the domestic help at D5, had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> disappearances. The residents claimed they had been repeatedly ignored by local authorities; therefore, they sought the help of former Resident Welfare Association (RWA) President S C Mishra. That morning, Mishra and the two residents searched the tank drain. One of the residents claimed to have found a decomposed hand, after which they called the police.|$|E
25|$|A 13th century {{northern}} English source {{claims that}} William was Mormaer of Moray. As this source {{had no reason}} to deceive, it is highly likely that William was made the ruler of Moray after the defeat of King Óengus of Moray in 1130. It is feasible that this grant had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> coming of age of David's son, Prince Henry and may also be a factor in his marriage to a daughter of Óengus. As well as being the ruler of Moray, William controlled the English lands of Allerdale, Skipton and Craven, making him one of the greatest barons of northern England.|$|E
25|$|In 1805, while a {{territorial}} legislator, Floyd {{became involved}} in the plot of Aaron Burr.

The company, believed to have had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conspiracy, was to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio on the Indiana side of the river. The company failed and the investors lost their money, which was believed to have been used to help finance Burr's plot. It was never proven that the money was stolen. The company had an initial investment of $120,000 and handled over one million dollars during its duration.|$|E

25|$|Patients with {{anterograde}} amnesia have trouble recalling new information and new autobiographical events, but {{the data are}} less consistent {{in regard to the}} latter. Medveds and Hirst recorded the presence of islands of memory– detailed accounts– that were described by such patients. The island memories were a combination of semantic and episodic memories. The researchers recorded patients giving long narratives with a fair amount of detail that resembled memories that the patients had prior to the trauma. The appearance of islands of memory could have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> functioning of adjacent cortical areas and the neocortex. In addition, the researchers suspect that the amygdala {{played a role in the}} narratives.|$|E
25|$|Miklos frequented the Académie de La Palette, {{where he}} learned Cubist techniques. There he {{studying}} under Henri Le Fauconnier, and later entered the studio of Jean Metzinger. He visited the group of artists, poets and writers of the Section d'Or. Shortly after the Armory Show in New York, Miklos participated in the Exhibition of Cubist and Futurist Pictures, Boggs & Buhl Department Store, Pittsburgh, July 1913. The exhibition included works by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Jacques Villon, Fernand Léger, Pierre Dumont and Arpad Kesmarky. Sponsored by the Gimbel Brothers department store, the Cubist and Futurist show toured Milwaukee, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and New York from May through the summer of 1913. Walter Pach, knowing practically all the artists in the exhibition, probably had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> organization of the show.|$|E
25|$|Producing metric {{drawings}} and analyzing {{the materials used}} in the Derwent V went fairly quickly, but finding {{a substitute for the}} high-temperature, creep-resistant Nimonic 80 steel alloy was a more difficult challenge. Eventually an alloy that matched Nimonic 80's high-temperature properties was found in KhN 80T, but it was not creep-resistant. The first Derwent V copy, designated as the RD-500 (Reaktivnyy Dvigatel — jet engine) after the Factory No. 500 where the engine was first produced, was being tested on 31 December 1947, but problems cropped up quickly. Combustion was uneven and this cracked the combustion chambers. This may have had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> modifications made by the Soviets to the fuel, speed and starter systems. But these problems were resolved by September 1948 when the engine passed its 100-hour State acceptance test.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of Awole there was a {{scramble}} for the throne by numerous contenders; some {{were reported to have}} spent less than six months on the throne; there was also a period of interregnum of almost twenty years where the various factions could not agree on a candidate for the throne. This period of vacuum led to the rise of powerful military and regional commanders like Adegun, the Onikoyi and others like the Otun to the Are-Ona Kakanfo, called Solagberu, and also Shehu Alimi, who was the leader of a growing Muslim population in Oyo. These new powers had lost regard for the office of the Alaafin due to the various political wranglings and the lack of a central authority at the time; this situation eventually led up to Afonja seceding Ilorin from Oyo in 1817 with the help of Oyo Muslims. In 1823, after Afonja had been killed by his allies, Shehu Alimi and Solagberu (Solagberu was also later killed by Alimi's son), Ilorin became part of the Sokoto Caliphate. By the time Captain Hugh Clapperton visited Oyo-Ile in 1825 during the reign of Alaafin Majotu, the empire was already in a state of decline. Clapperton's party recorded passing numerous Oyo villages burned by the Fulani (Ilorin) while Majotu had also sought the help of the English king and the Oba of Benin in putting down the Ilorin rebellion. Clapperton also noticed a shortage of horses, even though the Oyo were renowned as a great cavalry force; this might have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fact that most of the empire's soldiers and hence cavalry were stationed at Ilorin under the command of Afonja and later on Alimi's successors.|$|E
500|$|Though {{a common}} theme was not purposefully {{established}} for the album, some journalists noted similar feelings of travel and adventure when listening to the record.

500|$|Seizures in {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy {{can affect the}} normal development of new neurons and can cause tissue damage. Hippocampal sclerosis {{is the most common}} type of such tissue damage. It is not yet clear, however, whether the epilepsy is usually caused by hippocampal abnormalities or whether the hippocampus is damaged by cumulative effects of seizures. However, [...] in experimental settings where repetitive seizures are artificially induced in animals, hippocampal damage is a frequent result. This may be a consequence of the concentration of excitable glutamate receptors in the hippocampus. Hyperexcitability can lead to cytotoxicity and cell death. It may also have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hippocampus being a site where new neurons continue to be created throughout life, and to abnormalities in this process.|$|E
500|$|Pattycake moved {{permanently}} to the Bronx Zoo on December 20, 1982. For a few years, {{she lived}} in a cage with Pansy, a chimpanzee. [...] In June 1999, Pattycake moved into the Wildlife Conservation Society's $43 million Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit. [...] The exhibit includes a Great Gorilla Forest viewing area that separates gorillas and visitors with a glass window. Two troops of gorillas inhabited the 6.5 acre exhibit, with a dozen gorillas in Pattycake's troop alone, including Fubo, Pattycake, Tunko, Triska, Halima, Fran, Layla, Kumi, Suki, Babatunde, Barbara, and M'domo. The general curator of the Bronx Zoo, James Doherty, described Pattycake as [...] "independent" [...] with [...] "few close friends" [...] in the Congo Gorilla Forest. [...] "It may have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fact that she didn't live with her parents that long, and lived with that chimpanzee for a few years," [...] Doherty said.|$|E
