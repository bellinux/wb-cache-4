In almost all the <b>spherical</b> <b>robots,</b> communication between the internal driving unit and the external control unit (data logging or navigation system) is wireless because of the mobility and closed nature of the spherical shell.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{efficient}} locomotion and natural tolerance to hazardous environments, <b>spherical</b> <b>robots</b> have wide applications in security surveillance, exploration of unknown territory and emergency response. Numerous {{studies have been}} conducted on the driving mechanism, motion planning and trajectory tracking methods of <b>spherical</b> <b>robots,</b> yet very limited {{studies have been conducted}} regarding the obstacle avoidance capability of <b>spherical</b> <b>robots.</b> Most of the existing <b>spherical</b> <b>robots</b> rely on the “hit and run” technique, which has been argued to be a reasonable strategy because <b>spherical</b> <b>robots</b> have an inherent ability to recover from collisions. Without protruding components, they will not become stuck and can simply roll back after running into bstacles. However, for small scale <b>spherical</b> <b>robots</b> that contain sensitive surveillance sensors and cannot afford to utilize heavy protective shells, the absence of obstacle avoidance solutions would leave the robot at the mercy of potentially dangerous obstacles. In this paper, a compact magnetic field-based obstacle detection and avoidance system has been developed for miniature <b>spherical</b> <b>robots.</b> It utilizes a passive magnetic field so that the system is both compact and power efficient. The proposed system can detect not only the presence, but also the approaching direction of a ferromagnetic obstacle, therefore, an intelligent avoidance behavior can be generated by adapting the trajectory tracking method with the detection information. Design optimization is conducted to enhance the obstacle detection performance and detailed avoidance strategies are devised. Experimental results are also presented for validation purposes...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to develop a}} control method which can reduce {{oscillation}} of lateral motion for a pendulum driven <b>spherical</b> <b>robot</b> operating on flat surface. The <b>spherical</b> <b>robot</b> provides a unique mobility and has several applications in surveillance and entertainment. Controlling a <b>spherical</b> <b>robot</b> is a challenging problem till today due to its nature of kinematics and dynamics. Firstly, its nonholonomic nature prohibits the use of conventional state feedback control laws. Secondly, kinematics of a <b>spherical</b> <b>robot</b> cannot be expressed as a chained-form system to utilize nonholonomic control algorithms. However, various types of nonlinear control algorithms were proposed to settle the problem though none of them provided satisfactory result. The kinematics and dynamics of the pendulum driven <b>spherical</b> <b>robot</b> was investigated followed by linearization for longitudinal and lateral motions through frequency and state space transformation. Moreover, the controllability of the states of the system was maintained during linearization. A robust self-tuning sliding mode con troller which suspends oscillation, maintains desired speed and compensates for unmodeled parameters was developed. The implemented control system consists of control station, prototype robot equipped with on-board microcontroller and sensors, and wireless communication link. Simulation and experimentation were conducted to test peformance of the control laws in suppressing oscillation and maintaining desired speed of the robot. The robot traveled to the commanded trajectory containing straight line and curve with relatively minimum oscillation at desired speed. Thus, the sliding mode control is an effective controller...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to compare barycenter offset based designs of <b>spherical</b> <b>robots</b> to control moment gyroscope (CMG) based designs in order to determine which approach is most effective. The first objective was to develop a list of current state of the art designs in order to gain an overall understanding of what the obstacles in this area of research were. The investigation showed that barycenter offset designs can produce a low, continuous output torque, whereas CMG based designs can usually only produce a high, momentary output torque. The second objective was to develop a CMG based design that has the potential to outperform current state barycenter offset based designs. A design consisting of a dual, scissored-pair CMG (DSP-VSCMG) configuration was proposed and the dynamics derived from first principles. The third objective was to develop a set of equations that can describe performance characteristics of <b>spherical</b> <b>robots.</b> The equations that were modeled were power consumption, translational velocity, maximum incline plane, step size from rest, as well as CMG inertias and geometries. The fourth objective was to perform a series of parametric analysis using the developed equation set to compare barycenter and DSP-VSCMG based designs in a controlled environment. The analysis showed that DSP-VSCMG based designs can be more agile than barycenter designs, but require more power to do so...|$|R
