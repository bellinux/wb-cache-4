5|$|A {{more recent}} theory, with broad support among archaeologists, is that Celtic culture and {{language}} arrived in Ireland {{as a result}} of cultural diffusion.

40|$|In an {{international}} research climate of increasingly demanding ethical review, {{based on a}} biomedical model, reflection on best practices in <b>social,</b> behavioural <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> science research is necessary. It is widely believed that these sciences cannot be held to the same practical requirements as those for biomedical research, although the principles of ethical research are surely universal. This article considers the ethical requirements, principles and guidelines directing research in the <b>social,</b> behavioural <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> sciences, recognised in the national and international arena. By means of a systematic review of available best practices, it is anticipated that general guidelines for <b>social,</b> behavioural <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> science research could be developed and offered to researchers in these fields. Specific consideration {{is given to the}} unique characteristics of <b>social,</b> behavioural <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> science research...|$|R

5|$|The {{principal}} governing {{institutions of}} medieval Birmingham – including the Guild of the Holy Cross and the lordship of the de Birmingham family – collapsed between 1536 and 1547, leaving {{the town with}} an unusually high degree of <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> freedom and initiating a period of transition and growth.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between <b>social</b> cohesion <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> vulnerability in Europe. The analyses are build around two main research hypotheses. The first one argues {{the existence of a}} direct and negative association between <b>economic</b> inequality <b>and</b> <b>social</b> cohesion. The second supposition states that this connection is mediated by some factors which include the individuals’ position in the stratification system (i. e. social class). Finally, we believe that welfare state could be relevant because it influences both the relationship between <b>social</b> class <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> vulnerability <b>and</b> the link between <b>social</b> cohesion <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> vulnerability. The empirical analysis –based on the European Social Survey (ESS) carried out in 2003 – shows the central role played by the welfare state and the existence of a direct and negative connection between <b>social</b> cohesion <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> vulnerability, only partially mediated by the effect of social class...|$|R
