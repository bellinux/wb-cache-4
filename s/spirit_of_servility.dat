60|$|The {{spirit of}} oppression, the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>servility,</b> {{and the spirit}} of fraud, these are the {{immediate}} growth of the established administration of property. They are alike hostile to intellectual improvement. The other vices of envy, malice, and revenge are their inseparable companions. In a state of society where men lived in the midst of plenty and where all shared alike the bounties of nature, these sentiments would inevitably expire. The narrow principle of selfishness would vanish. No man being obliged to guard his little store or provide with anxiety and pain for his restless wants, each would lose his individual existence in the thought of the general good. No man would be an enemy to his neighbour, for they would have no subject of contention, and, of consequence, philanthropy would resume the empire which reason assigns her. Mind would be delivered from her perpetual anxiety about corporal support, and free to expatiate in the field of thought, which is congenial to her. Each would assist the inquiries of all.|$|E

50|$|The {{study of}} slavery in Ancient Greece remains a complex subject, {{in part because of}} the many {{different}} levels <b>of</b> <b>servility,</b> from traditional chattel slave through various forms of serfdom, such as Helots, Penestai, and several other classes of non-citizen.|$|R

5000|$|The British jurist Basil Montagu {{wrote in}} Bacon's defence, {{concerning}} the episode of his public disgrace: Bacon {{has been accused}} <b>of</b> <b>servility,</b> <b>of</b> dissimulation, of various base motives, and their filthy brood of base actions, all unworthy of his high birth, and incompatible with his great wisdom, and the estimation {{in which he was}} held by the noblest <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> the age. It is true that there were men in his own time, and will be men in all times, who are better pleased to count spots in the sun than to rejoice in its glorious brightness. Such men have openly libelled him, like Dewes and Weldon, whose falsehoods were detected as soon as uttered, or have fastened upon certain ceremonious compliments and dedications, the fashion of his day, as a sample <b>of</b> his <b>servility,</b> passing over his noble letters to the Queen, his lofty contempt for the Lord Keeper Puckering, his open dealing with Sir Robert Cecil, and with others, who, powerful when he was nothing, might have blighted his opening fortunes for ever, forgetting his advocacy of the rights {{of the people in the}} face of the court, and the true and honest counsels, always given by him, in times of great difficulty, both to Elizabeth and her successor. When was a [...] "base sycophant" [...] loved and honoured by piety such as that of Herbert, Tennison, and Rawley, by noble spirits like Hobbes, Ben Jonson, and Selden, or followed to the grave, and beyond it, with devoted affection such as that of Sir Thomas Meautys.|$|R

It was {{distinctly}} more fitting to his newborn dignity to be as rude as possible; it was a sure sign <b>of</b> <b>servility</b> to meekly reply to civil questions.|$|R
60|$|When he had gone, Alday advanced, hat in hand, {{and gave}} me back my revolver, which I had {{forgotten}} all about. I took it with my left hand, {{and put it in}} my pocket.

60|$|Nikasti moved a step nearer towards her. Something <b>of</b> the <b>servility</b> <b>of</b> {{his manner}} had gone.

The insidious images exacted a devastating toll on Black Americans and continue to undermine race relations.|$|R

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 12th {{century the}} term miles—theretofore {{reserved}} for free warriors—was also being applied to ministerials. Over the course of the 13th century their status was slowly assimilated to that of the free nobility, or vassals.

60|$|When his servant entered, {{he looked}} at him steadfastly, and {{wondered}} if he had thought of peering behind the screen. The man was quite impassive, and waited for his orders. Dorian lit a cigarette, {{and walked over to the}} glass and glanced into it. He could see the reflection of Victor's face perfectly. It was like a placid mask <b>of</b> <b>servility.</b> There was nothing to be afraid of, there. Yet he thought it best to be on his guard.|$|R
50|$|In 1849, {{he became}} prime {{minister}} and minister of foreign affairs of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies until 1852. His government, because of the revolution of 1848 against the monarchy, was absolute and conservative. Accused <b>of</b> <b>servility</b> to the king, he was strongly criticized by Giuseppe Ricciardi, Giacomo Racioppi, Pier Silvestro Leopardi and, in particular, Luigi Settembrini, who considered him an insatiable and fierce hyena. However, Fortunato seconded the sovereign in the convictions against the liberals.|$|R

Several times, during the course of the series, Stevens has been at the sharp end of some gentleman's displeasure through no fault of his own, but his tact and devotion to the Jones family resolves every situation in a face saving gesture <b>of</b> <b>servility.</b>|$|R
50|$|With his calibre {{to perform}} any {{challenging}} role and a flexible mindset that {{prompted him to}} occasionally do minor roles (with some new elements), Krishnan Nair was probably the pioneering Kathakali artiste who was a hardcore professional—in {{the sense that he}} was the arguably the first to dictate the rate for each of his performances. It was a watershed move in an art form that had huge feudal hangovers and its entailing element <b>of</b> <b>servility</b> that patrons expected from the artistes.|$|R
40|$|Philip Pettit and Quentin Skinner find Hobbes's {{understanding}} of freedom as non-interference inadequate because {{it fails to}} appreciate {{what is wrong with}} a life lived as a slave. Though their critiques have some force, however, Hobbes's view of freedom has virtues of its own. It is highly sensitive to the fact that freedom is a matter of degree. It is also unlikely to mistake freedom for something else, like security or dignity. Moreover, Hobbes is not as unmindful of the dangers <b>of</b> <b>servility</b> as many think...|$|R
60|$|Christianity inculcates the {{necessity}} of supplicating the Deity. Prayer may be considered under two points of view;--as an endeavour to change the intentions of God, or as a formal testimony of our obedience. But the former case supposes that the caprices of a limited intelligence can occasionally instruct the Creator of the world how to regulate the universe; and the latter, a certain degree <b>of</b> <b>servility</b> analogous to the loyalty demanded by earthly tyrants. Obedience indeed is only the pitiful and cowardly egotism of him who thinks {{that he can do}} something better than reason.|$|R

40|$|I {{advance a}} novel natural duty account of {{political}} obligation in my dissertation. A satisfactory account of political obligation {{must be able}} to show that there is a prima facie duty to do as the law commands because the law commands it. Extant natural duty accounts are vulnerable to the charge that the best they can do is establish that there is a duty to comply with a special subset of laws, namely those laws general compliance with which is necessary for the state’s ability to administer justice or rescue people from the perils of the state of nature. The view I develop overcomes this objection. My strategy is to argue that justice intrinsically requires not only that we enter into political society, but further that we establish a particular kind of society – one in which every person has an equal democratic say. I argue that there is an important kind <b>of</b> <b>servility</b> that has been overlooked in the literature. This servility consists in the willingness to subordinate one’s capacity for moral judgement to another’s. I draw upon this account <b>of</b> <b>servility</b> in developing a new argument for the right to an equal democratic say. Finally, I argue that laws which issue from a democratic process, a process that is itself intrinsically required by justice, have authority. 2019 - 05 - 3...|$|R
60|$|Miss Jervois, who is Richardson's {{idea of a}} jeune {{personne}} bien elevee, is {{a compound}} <b>of</b> tears, <b>of</b> <b>servility,</b> and <b>of</b> undisguised love for her guardian. She is much more like the heroine of a French drama than an English girl of fourteen, and I dread to think what effect she would have on a free-born American! Harriet, as you know, is not quite hopeless at first, but the descent is easy, and, in the end, we quite agree with all the admiring circle, that they were made for each other. They were equally pompous, and used stilts of equal height.|$|R

60|$|While {{hardly any}} one will {{question}} that a naval officer should {{be surrounded by}} circumstances calculated to impart a requisite dignity to his position, {{it is not the}} less certain that, by the excessive pomp he at present maintains, there is naturally and unavoidably generated a feeling <b>of</b> <b>servility</b> and debasement in the hearts of most of the seamen who continually behold a fellow-mortal flourishing over their heads like the archangel Michael with a thousand wings. And as, in degree, this same pomp is observed toward their inferiors by all the grades of commissioned officers, even down to a midshipman, the evil is proportionately multiplied.|$|R
60|$|The valet stole up, self-accused, a timid, servile creature, {{rubbing his}} hands nervously, and suspecting mischief. He was a rat in trouble. He had thin brown hair, neatly brushed and {{plastered}} down, {{so as to}} make it look still thinner, and his face was the average narrow cunning face of the dishonest man-servant. It had an ounce of wile in it to a pound or two <b>of</b> <b>servility.</b> He seemed just the sort of rogue meanly to join in an underhand conspiracy, and then meanly to back out of it. You could read at a glance that his principle in life was to save his own bacon.|$|R
5000|$|In 1848, Uspensky {{joined the}} Tula seminary {{where he was}} flogged on a daily basis. According to Korney Chukovsky, [...] Executions of this sort were the only {{pedagogical}} method known in this school. Flogging, vodka, bribery, cards, the atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>servility</b> and betrayal, outward piety and secret debauchery—such were {{the basic elements of}} Nikolai's upbringing for more than ten years. One thing he could take refuge in were wild shenanigans... in which his brilliant talents, otherwise pent up, could be realized to some extent. For, despite things that were going on around him his mirth was fountain-like, making him perform every minute some kind of trick, practical joke or mystification.|$|R

60|$|Was she in {{love with}} Ditmar? The {{question}} was distasteful, she avoided it, for enough of the tatters of orthodox Christianity clung to her to cause her to feel shame when she contemplated the feelings he aroused in her. It was when she asked herself what his intentions were that her resentment burned, pride {{and a sense of}} her own value convinced her that he had deeply insulted her in not offering marriage. Plainly, he did not intend to offer marriage; on the other hand, if he had done so, a profound, self-respecting and moral instinct in her would, in her present mood, have led her to refuse. She felt a fine scorn for the woman who, under the circumstances, would insist upon a bond and all a man's worldly goods in return for that which it was her privilege to give freely; while the notion <b>of</b> <b>servility,</b> <b>of</b> economic dependence--though she did not so phrase it--repelled her far more than the possibility of social ruin.|$|R
