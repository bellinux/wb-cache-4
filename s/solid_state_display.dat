Reaction with uranyl nitrate in water–acetonitrile at 180 °C gives the complex [(UO 2) 3 (L) (HL) O(OH) 3]· 2. 5 H 2 O·CH 3 CN (2), different from the previously reported [UO 2 (L) (OH) ] (1). Complex 2 crystallizes as a ribbon-like one-dimensional coordination polymer, with an oxo/hydroxo-bridged skeleton, in which the uranyl cation is bound to the bridging bidentate carboxylate groups, the pyridyl groups (one of them protonated) being directed sideways. In the additional presence of copper nitrate, the reaction gives the heterometallic complex [(UO 2) 2 Cu(L) 3 (O) (H 2 O) ](NO 3) (3), in which the harder uranium atom is bound to two m 3 -oxo anions to generate a tetranuclear secondary building unit, and to chelating and bridging carboxylate groups, while the softer copper cations are bound to three pyridyl groups and only one carboxylate donor. The copper atoms are further involved in cation–cation interactions with uranyl oxo groups, the Cu–O(oxo) bond lengths of 2. 162 (13) and 2. 248 (16) Å being among the shortest measured up to now. 3 crystallizes as a three-dimensional assembly displaying narrow channels, and it illustrates the ability of copper cations, in association with a ditopic ligand, to assemble discrete uranylcontaining units into a framework structure.

While [UO 2 (L) (H 2 O) ]· 1. 25 CH 3 CN (1) and [UO 2 (L) (DMF) ] (2) are one-dimensional (1 D) species analogous to that previously known, [H 2 NMe 2] 2 [(UO 2) 2 (L) 3]· 1. 5 H 2 O (3), which includes dimethylammonium counterions generated in situ, is a three-dimensional (3 D) framework, and [UO 2 (L) (NMP) ] (4) (NMP = N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone) is a braid-shaped 1 D polymer. When 3 d block metal ions are present and bound to 2, 2 ?-bipyridine (bipy) coligands, their role is reduced to that of decorating species attached to uranyl-containing 1 D polymers, as in [UO 2 M(L) 2 (bipy) 2]· 0. 5 H 2 O with M = Co (5) or Ni (6), and [(UO 2) 2 Cu 2 (L) 3 (NO 3) 2 (bipy) 2]· 0. 5 H 2 O (9), or of counterions, as in [Ni(bipy) 3][(UO 2) 4 (O) 2 (L) 3]· 3 H 2 O (7), in which a two-dimensional (2 D) assembly is built from tetranuclear uranyl-containing building units.

40|$|International audienceReaction of {{uranyl nitrate}} with 1, 3, 5 -benzenetriacetic acid (H 3 BTA) in the {{presence}} of additional species, either organic bases or their conjugate acids or metal cations, has provided 12 new crystalline complexes, all but one obtained under solvo-hydrothermal conditions. The complexes [C(NH 2) 3][UO 2 (BTA) ]·H 2 O (1) and [H 2 NMe 2]-[UO 2 (BTA) ] (2) crystallize as one-or two-dimensional (1 D or 2 D) assemblies, respectively, both with uranyl tris-chelation by carboxylate groups and hydrogen-bonded counterions but different ligand con-formations. One of the bound carboxylate units is replaced by chelating 1, 10 -phenanthroline (phen) or 3, 4, 7, 8 -tetramethyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline (Me 4 phen) in the complexes [(UO 2) 3 (BTA) 2 (phen) 3]· 4 H 2 O (3) and [(UO 2) 3 (BTA) 2 (Me 4 phen) 3]·NMP· 3 H 2 O (4) (NMP = N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone), which are a 2 D network with honeycomb topology and a 1 D polymer, respectively. With silver(I) cations, [UO 2 Ag(BTA) ] (5), a three-dimensional (3 D) framework in which the ligand assumes various chelating/bridging coordination modes, and the aromatic ring is involved in Ag(I) bonding, is obtained. A series of seven heterometallic complexes results when lead(II) cations and N-chelating molecules are both present. The complexes [UO 2 Pb(BTA) (NO 3) (bipy) ] (6) and [UO 2 Pb 2 (BTA) 2 (bipy) 2]· 3 H 2 O (7), where bipy is 2, 2 ′-bipyridine, crystallize from the one solution, as 1 D and 2 D assemblies, respectively. The two 1 D coordination polymers [UO 2 Pb(BTA) (HCOO) (phen) ] (8 and 9), again obtained from the one synthesis, provide an example of coordination isomerism, with the formate anion bound either to lead(II) or to uranyl cations. Another 2 D architecture is found in [(UO 2) 2 Pb 2 (BTA) 2 (HBTA) (H 2 O) 2 (phen) 2]· 2 H 2 O (10), which provides a possible example of a Pb−oxo(uranyl) " cation−cation " interaction. While [UO 2 Pb(BTA) (HCOO) 0. 5 (NO 3) 0. 5 (Me 2 phen) ] (11), where Me 2 phen is 5, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline, is a 1 D assembly close to those in 6 and 8, [UO 2 Pb 2 (BTA) 2 (Me 4 phen) 2] (12), obtained together with complex 4, crystallizes as a 2 D network {{as a result of the}} high degree of connectivity provided by the chelating/bridging tricarboxylate ligand. Emission spectra measured in the <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>display</b> vibronic fine structure attributable to uranyl luminescence (except for complex 5, in which emission is quenched), with variations in maxima positions associated with modifications of the uranyl ion environment. ■ INTRODUCTION The formation of solid frameworks incorporating cavities suited to selective absorption of molecular species and involving uranyl ion centers within the framework 1 has, as obvious potential applications, sensing due to changes in luminescence and catalytic photo-oxidation of any absorbed species. 2 Although an isolated uranyl center is a one-electron photo-oxidant, 2 c,d the possibility of arranging multiple uranyl centers about a single cavity in a solid raises the prospect of performing a variety of multielectron oxidations. Despite the extensive characterization of uranyl−organic coordination polymers and frameworks, however, systems that might be suitable for such applications have been obtained more by chance than design, and in the majority of cases only those that can be considered polyuranate derivatives have uranium(VI) centers in close proximity. The remarkable family of peroxo-bridged poly-uranates provides elegant examples of this situation. 3 It is known that uranyl luminescence is subject to numerous influences, 4 including the presence of other uranyl centers and of a variety of transition metal ions, 5, 6 so that the systematic investigation of mixed-metal uranyl coordination polymers would seem a rational pathway to applications of uranyl ion photochemistry. Recent reports by us and other groups have dealt with the investigation of the crystal structure and luminescence properties of uranyl ion complexes, coordination polymers or frameworks including 3 d block metal cations either as additional metal centers in the complex unit or as counterions, the ligands used being polycarboxylates or polyphosphonates. 5, 6 The present work is an extension of this survey to a poly(carboxylic acid), which has been little used in uranyl chemistry, 1, 3, 5 -benzenetriacetic acid (H 3 BTA), th...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGlobular {{proteins}} are peculiar solids {{that display}} both local stability of their conformation {{and the ability}} to undergo large cooperative changes of shape (conformational changes). If one forces a large deformation of the molecule, such that the structure is necessarily changed, it is not obvious whether the deformed globule can still remain a solid or whether it will melt. Is it possible to plastically deform a protein? Here we investigate this question with a micro-mechanical experiment on a small region (∼ 10 molecules) of a protein monolayer adsorbed on a rigid surface. For the two proteins studied, albumin and myoglobin, we observed that the molecules can be substantially deformed (∼ 1 – 2 nm deformation) by comparatively small stresses applied for sufficiently long times. The deformation is irreversible, and the protein remains in the <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> (i. e., <b>displays</b> a nonzero shear modulus). The dynamics of the deformation is approximately logarithmic in time, similar to creep in solids. These results show that globular proteins adsorbed on a surface can be plastically deformed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A recent {{advance in}} the field of light {{emitting}} polymers has been the discovery of electroluminescent conjugated polymers, that is, kind of fluorescent polymers that emit light when excited by the flow of an electric current. These new generation fluorescent materials may now challenge the domination by inorganic semiconductor materials of the commercial market in light-emitting devices such as light-emitting diodes (LED) and polymer laser devices. This review provides information on unique properties of conjugated polymers and how they have been optimized to generate these properties. The review is organized in three sections focusing on the major advances in light emitting materials, recent literature survey and understanding the desirable properties as well as modern <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> lighting and <b>displays.</b> Recently, developed conjugated polymers are also functioning as roll-up displays for computers and mobile phones, flexible solar panels for power portable equipment as well as organic light emitting diodes in displays, in which television screens, luminous traffic, information signs, and light-emitting wallpaper in homes are also expected to broaden the use of conjugated polymers as light emitting polymers.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{provides a}} panoramic {{overview of the}} recent progress in nanoglass plasmonics, challenges, excitement, applied interests and the future promises. Enhanced optical properties of rare earth (RE) doped glasses for sundry applications are current challenges in materials science and technology. Nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed up-converted (UC) glasses {{seem to be the}} ideal candidates in terms of both efficiency and large area coverage provided the absorption cross-section be enhanced. The glasses containing gold NPs (AuNPs) and silver NPs (AgNPs) doped with optimum concentration of RE ions are of particular interest to us. We report the influence of embedded NPs on the luminescence and absorbance characteristics of RE ions doped tellurite glass prepared by melt-quenching method. The absorption and emission spectra displays several prominent peaks corresponding to the transitions from the ground state to the excited states of RE ion. The observed efficient enhancement of up-conversion emissions and absorbance in the entire visible region is attributed to strong localized electric field in vicinity of NPs. Improvements of radiative emissions suggests that the proposed glasses are potential for the development of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> lasers, color <b>displays</b> and nanophotonic devices...|$|R
