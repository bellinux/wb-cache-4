40|$|AbstractThe {{biological}} {{benefits of}} certain carotenoids {{may be due}} to their potent antioxidant properties attributed to specific physico-chemical interactions with membranes. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effects of various carotenoids on rates of lipid peroxidation and correlated these findings with their membrane interactions, as determined by small angle X-ray diffraction approaches. The effects of the homochiral <b>carotenoids</b> (<b>astaxanthin,</b> zeaxanthin, lutein, β-carotene, lycopene) on lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) generation were evaluated in membranes enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids. Apolar carotenoids, such as lycopene and β-carotene, disordered the membrane bilayer and showed a potent pro-oxidant effect (> 85 % increase in LOOH levels) while astaxanthin preserved membrane structure and exhibited significant antioxidant activity (40 % decrease in LOOH levels). These findings indicate distinct effects of carotenoids on lipid peroxidation due to membrane structure changes. These contrasting effects of carotenoids on lipid peroxidation may explain differences in their biological activity...|$|R

Results: We have found that fluorescent lectins can often be advantageously replaced in such sensors by fluorescently labeled phospholipids. A coumarin-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine donor and a bis(1, 3 -dihexyl- 2 -thiobarbiturate) trimethineoxonol acceptor gave the largest sensitivity of fluorescence ratio (> 50 % per 100 mV) ever reported.
