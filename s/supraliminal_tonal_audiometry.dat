40|$|Introduction: The noise causes {{effects on}} the hearing and all organism. In hearing it may produce a {{threshold}} temporary shift (TTS) : for a short term the auditory sensitivity is increased due to the metabolic exhaustion of the hair cells {{in the presence of}} intense sounds. When the noise is eliminated, the hearing returns to its normal threshold. The individuals who work exposed to noise may acquire a permanent threshold shift (PTS). One of the ways to avoid the TTS/PTS is using the auditory protection when in the presence of noise. Objective: The objective of this research was to verify the efficacy of the auditory protections used by workers exposed to noise of 96. 5 dB (L) in a metallurgic factory in the countryside of the State of São Paulo. Method: <b>Tonal</b> <b>audiometry</b> before and after the working journey in 13 workers users of auditory protection of insertion type, exposed to 96. 5 dB (L), to determine whether there is TTS.

The APS was altered in 72. 7 % of the children and 45. 5 % of them presented altered results on the Dichotic Listening Test. Children with cleft lip/palate had altered results on BAE and APS, which justifies audiological and medical follow-up...|$|R
40|$|SummaryMismatch Negativity is an {{endogenous}} potential which reflects {{the processing of}} differences incurred in the acoustic stimulus. Aimto characterize MMN responses in elderly subjects and compare with adult subjects. Materials and methodsprospective study involving 30 subjects, 15 men and 15 women, aged between 60 and 80 years and 11 months. Statistical test: Mann-Whitney. The subjects went through medical evaluation, threshold <b>tonal</b> <b>audiometry,</b> immittance tests, otoacoustic emissions and short and long latency auditory potentials (MMN). Resultsmean latency was 161. 33 ms (CZA 2) and 148. 67 ms (CZA 1), in women; of 171 ms (CZA 2) and 159. 07 ms (CZA 1), men. Mean amplitude was − 2. 753 μV (CZA 2) and − 2. 177 μV (CZA 1), women; − 1. 847 μV (CZA 2) and − 1. 953 μV (CZA 1), men. As {{to the right and}} left hemispheres, mean latency variable of 166 ms (CZA 2) and 153. 87 ms (CZA 1); for the amplitude variable, mean value of − 2. 316 μV (CZA 2) and − 2. 065 μV (CZA 1). Conclusionthere is no statistically significant difference between the latency and amplitude when we compared males and females, right and left sides in the elderly and between chronologic ages between adults and elderly subjects...|$|R
40|$|Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (TL) is a neglected, non-contagious, {{infectious}} disease, {{caused by}} different protozoa {{species of the}} Leishmania genus that affects skin and mucous membranes. Meglumine Antimoniate (MA), the first drug of choice for TL treatment in Brazil, has already been associated with cochlear toxicity, which is defined as damages of the cochlea caused by exposure to chemical substances, resulting in reversible or irreversible hearing loss. Auditory monitoring for cochlear toxicity aims at the early detection of auditory disorders, enabling, when possible, hearing to be preserved or an early auditory rehabilitation. Although otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are used in this monitoring, {{there is no consensus}} on the criteria that define cochlear toxicity by this examination. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe the characteristics of the OAEs in cochlear toxicity monitoring in TL patients using MA. Prospective and longitudinal study of auditory monitoring of 35 patients with parasitological diagnosis of TL, with liminal <b>tonal</b> <b>audiometry,</b> high frequency audiometry, immitanciometry, distortion product evoked otoacoustic emissions (DPEOAEs) and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) before treatment, at the end of treatment, one month after the end of treatment and two months after the end of treatment. 80 % male, with median age of 44 years (IIQ: 22 - 59). In the pre-treatment evaluation: 11. 4 % complained of hearing loss and 20 % of tinnitus, 48. 6 % presented auditory alterations in liminal <b>tonal</b> <b>audiometry</b> (LTA, 65. 2 % in high frequency audiometry (HFA), 26. 6 % in DPEOAE and 51. 4 % in TEOAE. No association was verified between genre and alterations in the EOAE examinations. We observed that patients that presented disorders in DPEOAE examinations were 17 years older than those without alterations and that patients that showed disorders in TEOAEO examinations were 34 years older than those without disorders. The presence of alterations in DPEOAE and TEOAE before beginning treatment was associated with each other and with the presence of alterations in LTA and HFA, and only DPEOAE was associated with hearing loss. We observed a significantly higher number of alterations of DPEOAE at the end of treatment than during pre-treatment and values of the ratio signal/noise significantly smaller at the end of treatment than during pre-treatment in the frequencies of 2 kHz (difference of 1. 7 dB; p = 0. 016) and 4 kHz (difference of 2. 45 dB; p = 0. 016) in DPEOAE and in the range 1. 75 / 2. 5 kHz in TEOAE (difference of 2. 9 dB; p = 0. 039). The ototoxic signals observed in our study using EOAE indicated that both, DPEOAE and TEOAE are adequate and sensitive techniques for clinical monitoring of ototoxicity by MA. Their application is very simple, and their results help the physician to take the most adequate steps for each patient, thus avoiding permanent hearing damage...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficiency and applicability of a water-soluble formulation of CoQ 10 (Q-TER®) in subjects with presbycusis. Methods: A total of 60 patients with presbycusis were included and divided into three numerically equal groups. Group A underwent therapy with Q-TER®, 160 mg, once a day for 30 days; group B underwent therapy with vitamin E (50 mg), once a day for 30 days; group C received placebo, once a day for 30 days. Before and at the end of the treatment, all patients underwent pure tone audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, otoacoustic products of distortion, auditory brainstem response, and speech audiometry. Results: Compared with group B, at the end of the treatment in group A the liminar <b>tonal</b> <b>audiometry</b> showed a significant improvement of the air and bone thresholds at the 1000 (14 / 20 vs 9 / 20), 2000 (14 / 20 vs 7 / 20), 4000 (15 / 20 vs 6 / 20), and 8000 Hz (13 / 20 vs 5 / 20). We found no significant differences in the other parameters and in group C. Conclusion: These preliminary data are encouraging for a larger clinical trial to collect additional evidence on the effect of Q-TER® in preventing the development of hearing loss in subjects with presbycusis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) {{can involve}} the incudomalleolar or incudostapedial articulations. Objective. To know the punctual prevalence of audiological alterations {{in patients with}} RA. Patients and Methods. RA patients and their controls (Cs), were evaluated by <b>Tonal</b> <b>Audiometry</b> (AU); if there were alterations in the air conduction (AC), bone conduction (BC), Logoaudiometry (LG), and Tympanometry (T) were performed. Results. 45 RA patients and 45 Cs were evaluated. RA patients had 40 % of bilateral and 17. 8 % unilateral alteration versus Cs with 22. 2 % bilateral and 4. 4 % unilateral alteration versus Cs with 22. 2 % bilateral and 4. 4 % unilateral in AC audiometry. In conventional T (CT) As-type curves in patients with RA, there were 22 [*]LE (48. 8 %) and 26 RE (57. 7 %) versus Cs, there were 16 RE (35. 5 %) and 20 [*]LE (44. 4 %). In High-frequency T (HFT) : the 3 B 1 G pattern in RA more frequent versus Controls (Cs) in RE (P =. 002 and LE (P =. 01). There were no differences according to RA activity or RA disease evolution.
