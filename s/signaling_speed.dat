40|$|AbstractGlobal-motion {{perception}} {{is the perception}} of coherent motion in a noisy motion stimulus. Thresholds for coherent motion perception were measured for different combinations of <b>signal</b> and noise <b>speeds.</b> Previous research [Edwards, M., Badcock, D. R., & Smith, A. T. (1998). Independent speed-tuned global-motion systems. Vision Research, 38 (11), 1573 – 1580; Khuu, S. K., & Badcock, D. R. (2002). Global speed processing: evidence for local averaging within, but not across two speed ranges. Vision Research, 42 (28), 3031 – 3042. ] showed that thresholds were elevated when <b>signal</b> and noise <b>speeds</b> were similar, but not when they were different. The regions of increased threshold values for low and high <b>signal</b> <b>speeds</b> showed little overlap. On {{the basis of this}} evidence two independent speed-tuned systems were proposed: one for slow and one for fast-motion. However, in those studies only two <b>signal</b> <b>speeds</b> were used. We expanded the results by measuring threshold-curves for four different <b>signal</b> <b>speeds.</b> Considerable overlap of the threshold-curves was found between conditions.

It is a contemporary competitor to V-by-One HS that is promoted by the Video Electronics Standards Association. It removes all DRM, the auxiliary data channel, allows the designer to use more lanes than regular DisplayPort to deal with higher bandwidth needs, and requires one <b>signaling</b> <b>speed,</b> 3.24 GHz, instead of a clock speed that {{is tied to the}} incoming pixel rate. This interface allows the designer to use one to an unlimited number of lanes unlike regular DisplayPort which is restricted to 4 lanes maximum. Each iDP lane runs at 3.24 GHz. Due to 8b/10b overhead which enables clock recovery without a separate clock signal lane, each lane carries 2.592 gigabits per second after the overhead is removed. Padding is used to deal with the difference between the throughput supplied by iDP and the raw video throughput.|$|E
5000|$|Mu-metal was {{developed}} by British scientists Willoughby S. Smith and Henry J. Garnett and patented in 1923 for inductive loading of submarine telegraph cables by The Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Co. Ltd. (now Telcon Metals Ltd.), a British firm that built the Atlantic undersea telegraph cables. The conductive seawater surrounding an undersea cable added a significant capacitance to the cable, causing distortion of the signal, which limited the bandwidth and slowed <b>signaling</b> <b>speed</b> to 10-12 words per minute. The bandwidth could be increased by adding inductance to compensate. This was first done by wrapping the conductors with a helical wrapping of metal tape or wire of high magnetic permeability, which confined the magnetic field. Telcon invented mu-metal to compete with permalloy, the first high-permeability alloy used for cable compensation, whose patent rights were held by competitor Western Electric. Mu-metal {{was developed}} by adding copper to permalloy to improve ductility. 50 miles of fine mu-metal wire were needed for each mile of cable, creating a great demand for the alloy. The first year of production Telcon was making 30 tons per week. In the 1930s this use for mu-metal declined, but by World War II many other uses {{were found in the}} electronics industry (particularly shielding for transformers and cathode ray tubes), as well as the fuzes inside magnetic mines.

However, the maximum fluorescent enhancement associated with these 8 - 17 constructs is typically ≤ 10 -fold, due to a high fluorescent background.

The circuit consists of two mutually inhibiting and self-activating genes, forced by two external signals with identical stationary values but different transient times. Under these conditions, slow passage through the decision point leads to a consistently biased decision due to the transient signaling asymmetry, whereas fast passage reduces and eventually eliminates the switch imbalance.

40|$|SummaryAnimal {{signals are}} {{optimized}} for particular signaling environments [1 – 3]. While signaling, senders often choose favorable conditions that ensure reliable detection and transmission [4 – 8], {{suggesting that they}} are sensitive to changes in signal efficacy. Recent evidence has also shown that animals will increase the amplitude or intensity of their acoustic signals at times of increased environmental noise [9 – 11]. The nature of these adjustments provides important insights into sensory processing. However, only {{a single piece of}} correlative evidence for signals defined by movement suggests that visual-signal design depends on ambient motion noise [12]. Here we show experimentally {{for the first time that}} animals communicating with movement will adjust their displays when environmental motion noise increases. Surprisingly, under sustained wind conditions, the Australian lizard Amphibolurus muricatus changed the structure and increased the duration of its introductory tail flicking, rather than increasing <b>signaling</b> <b>speed.</b> The way these lizards restructure the alerting component of their movement-based aggressive display in the presence of increased motion noise highlights the challenge we face in understanding motion-detection mechanisms under natural operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{creation}} of protein from DNA {{is a dynamic}} process consisting of numerous reactions, such as transcription, translation and protein folding. Each of these reactions is further comprised of {{hundreds or thousands of}} sub-steps that must be completed before a protein is fully mature. Consequently, {{the time it takes to}} create a single protein depends on the number of steps in the reaction chain and the nature of each step. One way to account for these reactions in models of gene regulatory networks is to incorporate dynamical delay. However, the stochastic nature of the reactions necessary to produce protein leads to a waiting time that is randomly distributed. Here, we use queueing theory to examine the effects of such distributed delay on the propagation of information through transcriptionally regulated genetic networks. In an analytically tractable model we find that increasing the randomness in protein production delay can increase <b>signaling</b> <b>speed</b> in transcriptional networks. The effect is confirmed in stochastic simulations, and we demonstrate its impact in several common transcriptional motifs. In particular, we show that in feedforward loops signaling time and magnitude are significantly affected by distributed delay. In addition, delay has previously been shown to cause stable oscillations in circuits with negative feedback. We show that the period and the amplitude of the oscillations monotonically decrease a...|$|E

Drilling fluid pulse transmission method is the main method of wireless information transmission in the drilling guidance parameter transmission. The transmission speed of drilling fluid pulse signal is an important point in the transmission characteristics of drilling fluid pulse signal, which is of great significance {{to the design of}} drilling guidance parameter transmission system, drilling fluid pulse signal transmission speed and drilling fluid temperature, drilling fluid composition and pulse pressure, and drilling fluid solid content and gas content, drill string diameter, and other factors. In the actual mining conditions, the drilling fluid is a kind of solid, liquid, and gas multi-phase mixed fluid. Drilling fluid contains solid material such as cuttings and contains gaseous substances such as air bubbles. The theoretical formula of pulse transmission speed of drilling fluid pulse generator is proposed. Considering the influence of drilling fluid temperature, drilling fluid composition, pulse pressure, drilling fluid solid content, gas content, diameter of drill string and other factors, the unsteady flow theory is used to deduce the pulse transmission velocity of drilling fluid pulse generator The theoretical formula is in the mud pulse transmission system; the signal transmission speed is a basic parameter.

After a prolonged search, permalloy was discovered in 1914 by Gustav Elmen of Bell Laboratories, who found it had higher permeability than silicon steel.
