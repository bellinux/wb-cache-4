5|$|A {{city can}} be created from a town by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 39 of The Cities Act {{if it has a}} {{population}} of 5,000 or more and the change in <b>status</b> <b>is</b> requested by the town council. A city does not automatically revert to town status if the population drops below 5,000; this only occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote to revert to town status, or the minister is of the opinion that the reversion to town <b>status</b> <b>is</b> in the public interest. Melville retains its city status despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Remaining {{sperm whale}} populations are large {{enough that the}} species' {{conservation}} <b>status</b> <b>is</b> rated as vulnerable rather than endangered. However, the recovery from centuries of commercial whaling is a slow process, particularly in the South Pacific, where the toll on breeding-age males was severe.|$|E

The primary threats are from habitat loss, but also from overexploitation and introduced species.|$|E
5|$|Because of its numbers, ubiquity, and {{association}} with human settlements, the house sparrow is culturally prominent. It is extensively, and usually unsuccessfully, persecuted as an agricultural pest. It has also often been kept as a pet, {{as well as}} being a food item and a symbol of lust, sexual potency, commonness, and vulgarity. Though it is widespread and abundant, its numbers have declined in some areas. The animal's conservation <b>status</b> <b>is</b> listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Government's unequivocal {{view that}} the right to vote is an implied {{constitutional}} right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution. Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's <b>status</b> <b>is</b> not likely to be brought before the courts in a dispute, the Cabinet should refer the matter to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution for an authoritative opinion.|$|E
5|$|Em's reviver <b>status</b> <b>is</b> {{discovered}} {{and she is}} confined to the dairy farm.

One of the main drivers of malnutrition is gender specific selection of the distribution of food resources.|$|E
