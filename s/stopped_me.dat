500|$|In 2006, Flea {{revealed}} that he once again considered leaving the band whilst touring {{in support of the}} album, stating that [...] "throughout the By the Way tour I would play a show and then go and sit on the end of my bed staring into space." [...] He planned to teach full-time at the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, but ultimately decided to remain within the band. Flea later stated that [...] "the most painful part of quitting, and the thing that <b>stopped</b> <b>me,</b> was the idea of telling Anthony." ...|$|E
500|$|Was it his ambitious poetry, {{which was}} written to win you, that stopped my ability to think? Did it cause all of my ideas to die {{as soon as they}} were born? Was it his heaven given ability, writing [...] which was blessed by the gods, that <b>stopped</b> <b>me</b> in my tracks? Neither he nor his companions who helped him were able to stop my poetic ability. Neither he nor the Muse which aids him each night can claim to have silenced me. For I am not afraid. However, when your beauty was gifted to him then I was lost and destroyed.|$|E
500|$|Money {{was very}} tight in Villeneuve's early career. He was a {{professional}} racing driver from his late teens, with no other income. In {{the first few years}} the bulk of his income actually came from snowmobile racing, where he was extremely successful. He could demand appearance money as well as race money, especially after winning the 1974 World Championship Snowmobile Derby. His second season in Formula Atlantic was part-sponsored by his snowmobile manufacturer, Skiroule. He credited some of his success to his snowmobiling days: [...] "Every winter, you would reckon on three or four big spills — and I'm talking about being thrown on to the ice at 100 miles per hour. Those things used to slide a lot, which taught me a great deal about control. And the visibility was terrible! Unless you were leading, you could see nothing, with all the snow blowing about. Good for the reactions — and it <b>stopped</b> <b>me</b> having any worries about racing in the rain." ...|$|E

And by God! you can't <b>stop</b> <b>me.</b> Put that in your pipe." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>Me</b> is a {{compilation}} album by English band The Smiths. It compiles the band's then-latest (but not last) three singles and their B-sides in reverse-chronological order. <b>Stop</b> <b>Me</b> {{was released in}} January 1988 by their Japanese record company, RCA Victor.|$|R
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Wild Night", {{a hybrid of}} R, soul and country music influences, which {{utilizes}} a moderate 4/4 time signature and features the lead guitar playing of Ronnie Montrose. The song's intro was created, according to Montrose, [...] when [...] "One afternoon I was messing around with {{what is now the}} intro on the record, [...] <b>stopped</b> <b>me</b> and ... said ' ... that thing you just played ... that's the intro, don't forget it'". This guitar driven intro in Clinton Heylin's opinion made it one of Morrison's most memorable singles. [...] "Wild Night", which has been described by biographer Ken Brooks as [...] "a great start to the album", was first recorded after the Astral Weeks sessions in Autumn 1968 and was re-recorded numerous times before its eventual release on Tupelo Honey. Morrison recalled during an interview that the song was originally [...] "a much slower number, but when we got to fooling around with it in the studio, we ended up doing it in a faster tempo." ...|$|E
500|$|Two riders very {{disappointed}} with their results were Michael Matthews and Fabian Cancellara. Matthews crashed {{at high speed}} shortly before the Cipressa and arrived at the finish with a bandaged right elbow. He said: [...] "Obviously I'm devastated. [...] This was everything, this was my world championships {{for the start of}} the season. [...] I was really looking forward to making a good finale, it's really unfortunate that a crash <b>stopped</b> <b>me</b> from doing that." [...] Cancellara, who was riding the event for the last time before retirement at the end of the 2016 season, was held up in Gaviria's crash after having stayed in the leading group. He described his final kilometres as difficult, as he had been isolated from his teammates, saying that the other riders mainly attacked him and did not work with him. Another rider who was almost involved when Gaviria fell was Peter Sagan, who confirmed that the peloton had covered Cancellara in particular. He went on to describe the moment of Gaviria's crash: [...] "Then I got away with Boasson Hagen, Gaviria and someone else. Then with about 500 metres to go, Gaviria looked around because the group was coming up. He went down and I only just managed to avoid him. I stayed up but I lost a lot speed and never managed to get going again in the final metres." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1987 Harrison {{released}} the platinum album Cloud Nine. Co-produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, the LP included Harrison's rendition of James Ray's [...] "Got My Mind Set on You", which went to {{number one in}} the US and number two in the UK. The accompanying music video received substantial airplay, and another single, [...] "When We Was Fab", a retrospective of the Beatles' career, earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988. Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Jim Keltner, and Jim Horn, who recalled Harrison's relaxed and friendly demeanour during the sessions: [...] "George made you feel at home, in his home... He once had me sit on a toilet and play my soprano sax, and they miked it {{at the end of the}} hall for a distant sound. I thought they were kidding... Another time he <b>stopped</b> <b>me</b> in the middle of a sax solo and brought me 3 p.m. tea—again I thought he was kidding." [...] Cloud Nine reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively, and several tracks from the album achieved placement on Billboards Mainstream Rock chart – [...] "Devil's Radio", [...] "This Is Love" [...] and [...] "Cloud 9".|$|E
60|$|MAUD. Should I {{naturally}} {{put my hand}} on them; {{or would}} there be a reaction quick enough to <b>stop</b> <b>me?</b> You see, I'm alone--and the point is whether the fear of being seen would <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> although I knew I couldn't be seen. It's rather subtle.|$|R

2500|$|Many {{parents have}} since <b>stopped</b> <b>me</b> {{on the street}} or in {{airports}} to thank me for helping them to raise fine children, and they've often added, [...] "I don't see any instant gratification in Baby and Child Care" [...] I answer that they're right--I've always advised parents to give their children firm, clear leadership and to ask for cooperation and politeness in return. On the other hand I've also received letters from conservative mothers saying, in effect, [...] "Thank God I've never used your horrible book. That's why my children take baths, wear clean clothes and get good grades in school." ...|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} fight, Henderson stated that [...] "I hit him hard, but I got that last blow in just to {{shut him up}} a little bit." [...] After UFC {{president}} Dana White said Henderson had made the comment in jest, Henderson clarified by stating, [...] "When you're {{in the heat of}} the moment, the ref hadn't <b>stopped</b> <b>me</b> yet, who knows what's going to happen, if he's going to recover. I really only hit him twice, once on my feet, once on the ground. I didn't keep going. I didn't go after him after the ref tried to stop me, it was nothing like that. It was a reaction of mine to keep going until I was stopped—and you know, it did feel good though." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1981, Adam & the Ants {{released}} another {{highly successful}} album, Prince Charming. The album featured two United Kingdom No.1 singles – [...] "Stand and Deliver" [...] {{and the title}} track [...] "Prince Charming" [...] – {{as well as the}} No.3 UK hit [...] "Ant Rap". This trio of singles was promoted by some of the most lavish music videos of the period and paved the way for Adam Ant's later acting career. The work schedule Adam Ant imposed upon himself was punishing. [...] "I took no holidays – and I mean no holidays. When Kings of the Wild Frontier took off, I was halfway through making Prince Charming, and so on, because we had to bring out an album and four singles a year. But the price you pay... I split my cartilage in Cleveland doing [...] "Goody Two Shoes", it was my body saying, 'Look, no!' Then I was back onstage doing the Motown 25 [...] show 10 days later, having had the operation. Nobody could have <b>stopped</b> <b>me,</b> or make me do it. I did it. I was very, very bad at pacing," [...] he later remembered.|$|E
2500|$|Ethel {{became a}} popular and well-loved {{character}} from {{very early on}} in the series. Ethel was a gossip who did not always get her facts right, and this was often used for comic effect, as was her use of malapropisms. She became famous for owning a pug named Willy. Ethel's famous lines being either, [...] "Where's my Willy?" [...] or, in a double entendre, [...] "Has anyone seen my Willy". It was originally intended for Ethel's dog to be a Yorkshire Terrier, but as no suitable Yorkie could be found, a pug was used instead. Over the seven years they worked together Willy (the actor) and Franklin became very attached to each other. So much so that Franklin even tried to buy Willy at one stage, commenting: [...] "I tried to buy him from the BBC but he's too valuable now, he earns a bomb in personal appearances." [...] Franklin was heart-broken in 1992 when the producers made the decision to retire Willy. On-screen Willy became ill and had to be put down. However just over two weeks after his last appearance on the programme the dog who played Willy died. Franklin has commented: [...] "A woman <b>stopped</b> <b>me</b> in the street and said: 'It was like him committing suicide. When he knew he wasn't wanted on that programme no more, he just turned over and died.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2001, Sehwag was {{involved}} in controversy in the Second Test match between India and South Africa at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, when {{he was given a}} one Test ban for [...] "excessive appealing" [...] by ICC Match referee Mike Denness. He was one of six Indian players to receive bans, four of which were suspended bans. The unprecedented severity of the bans precipitated an international cricketing, political and administrative crisis, with the Indian cricket establishment threatening to call off the tour unless Mike Denness was removed as match referee from the third test match. ICC backed Mike Denness and the South African board backed the Indian cricket establishment and did not allow Mike Denness to enter the stadium {{on the first day of}} the third test match. ICC declared that the match was 'unofficial' and 'friendly five day match' and the series was officially declared as a 2 match series and South Africa as 1–0 winners. The subsequent England tour to India was placed in jeopardy when India picked Sehwag in the Test squad. Subsequent to this development, ICC issued a warning that any match with Sehwag in the cricket team will not be considered an [...] "official" [...] Test match until Sehwag had served his one match ban. After negotiations with ECB and ICC and in general interest of cricket, Sehwag was dropped from the team for the first Test against England. In October 2015, Sehwag told to Zee News [...] " [...] I was planning to retire in 2007 when dropped from the team but Tendulkar <b>stopped</b> <b>me</b> from doing so." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Attack" [...] {{had been}} around for a while and the band was unconvinced of its worth. The song proved to be {{somewhat}} problematic, and was nearly excluded from the album. During an interview in 2005, Jared Leto said [...] "'Attack' was a song that wasn't scheduled to be recorded at all. I'd been playing it – I'd play it in the desert in Morocco, I was playing it in Thailand – I was playing it everywhere." [...] When Jared tried performing the song {{with the rest of the}} band, something was wrong. [...] "On acoustic it was great; but when we played it as a band, it just fell flat on its face." [...] "As soon as the bass got in there…" [...] Matt Wachter continued. [...] "Yeah, so it was either replace Matt or throw the song out." [...] Jared played it acoustically for Josh Abraham; [...] "I was playing it outside of the studio one night on acoustic guitar and Josh walked out and, as a joke, I said 'Hey, you wanna hear a hit song?' I was just talking. I started playing the verse and went into the chorus and he <b>stopped</b> <b>me</b> on the first chorus and said 'It's the best song you have. You have to record it'. So we all got in a circle and something about it changed. Something about us changed. And it became the first song on the record and the first single off our album. So he did a great job on encouraging us to do that song. And now I really love it." [...] Jared told Josh Abraham that night [...] "This song deserves to be a hit just so we can tell this story." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{said that}} they are hoping for success like fellow British artists, One Direction, Adele, Cher Lloyd, the Wanted and Emeli Sandé have enjoyed. It was {{revealed}} by Perez Hilton that the band had been working with Demi Lovato in the recording studio. It was revealed that Sean Paul would feature on the album. When the band were introducing themselves to the American public, Rochelle Humes said she was the [...] "mum of the group", they call Mollie King the [...] "Disney characters" [...] although she said [...] "I'm not. I don't think life's a fairy tale, but I do {{like to see the}} good in situations." [...] Vanessa White revealed she loved to party: [...] "I love going out.

[...] Frankie Sandford said they the music industry was all she knew as she had been in the industry since she was a child in band, S Club 8, along with Humes. Where as Una Healy introduced herself along with her daughter Aoife Belle and husband, Ben Foden. The band said that the album would be [...] "obviously the Sats sound" [...] Sandford said that the album would be Dancey and upbeat but would ultimately be pop. King revealed that the band had written most of the songs on the album, which they were most excited about. The band {{said that they}} would like to bring [...] "girl power" [...] back to the US like the Spice Girls did. King said: [...] "Since the Spice Girls there hasn't been a British girlband to make it in the US, it would be nice for us to bring a little girl power into the scene." [...] However, fellow girl group Little Mix's debut album, DNA, set new records for a British girl group in the US in June 2013. Healy said she was [...] "overwhelmed" [...] with the people she has got the chance to work with on the album.|$|E
