5|$|The depots and airbases {{depended}} on an efficient road network, so the engineers gave this a high priority. A major {{effort was made}} to bring the roads up to all-weather standard before onset of the 1942 wet season. New roads were also built. One of the first was the By Pass Road, which was designed to divert traffic from the main road, which ran around the south eastern end of Jackson Drome, and was therefore an operational hazard. The By Pass Road ran between Jackson and Wards Dromes, and was later extended to Berry, Schwimmer and Durand Dromes. The opening of the new wharf at Tatana Island in October caused a sudden jump in road traffic, so a new Barune Road was opened in November that provided a loop to Jackson and Wards Dromes. Fortunately, the local red shale contained clay and rock fragments, and when laid on a prepared subgrade and watered, either by sprinklers or rain, became hard like concrete. This could take motor vehicle traffic, although it became dusty when dry and slippery when wet. <b>Surfacing</b> <b>material</b> was obtained from the Nine Mile Quarry. Wood was found to be unsuitable for culverts, as it was quickly destroyed by the action of climate and insects. Oil drums were found to be superior, but they rusted, and using them for culverts depleted the drum supply.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} other methods and {{materials}} to create pavements that have appearance of brick pavements. The first method to create brick texture is to heat an asphalt pavement and use metal wires to imprint a brick pattern using a compactor to create stamped asphalt. A similar {{method is to}} use rubber imprinting tools to press over {{a thin layer of}} cement to create decorative concrete. Another method is to use a brick pattern stencil and apply a <b>surfacing</b> <b>material</b> over the stencil. Materials that can be applied to give the color of the brick and skid resistance can be in many forms. An example is to use colored polymer-modified concrete slurry which can be applied by screeding or spraying. Another material is aggregate-reinforced thermoplastic which can be heat applied to the top layer of the brick-pattern surface. Other coating materials over stamped asphalt are paints and two-part epoxy coating.|$|E
2500|$|Applying gravel, or [...] "metalling," [...] {{has had two}} {{distinct}} usages in road surfacing. The term road metal refers to the broken stone or cinders used in the construction or repair of roads or railways, and {{is derived from the}} Latin metallum, which means both [...] "mine" [...] and [...] "quarry". [...] The term originally referred to the process of creating a gravel roadway. [...] The route of the roadway would first be dug down several feet and, depending on local conditions, French drains {{may or may not have}} been added. [...] Next, large stones were placed and compacted, followed by successive layers of smaller stones, until the road surface was composed of small stones compacted into a hard, durable surface. [...] "Road metal" [...] later became the name of stone chippings mixed with tar to form the road <b>surfacing</b> <b>material</b> tarmac. [...] A road of such material is called a [...] "metalled road" [...] in Britain, a [...] "paved road" [...] in Canada and the US, or a [...] "sealed road" [...] in parts of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E

50|$|The <b>surfacing</b> <b>material</b> {{selected}} for the building of advanced landing grounds during the first weeks after the Normandy invasion was known as square-mesh track (SMT). SMT, a British development, was material composed of heavy wire joined in three-inch squares. It was chosen over other surfacing materials because it was very lightweight, allowing sufficient quantities to be transported across the English channel on over-tasked landing craft. Easily workable, a SMT landing mat for fighters could be laid like a carpet in about one week.|$|E
50|$|The {{stabilization}} {{of the front}} lines in the Netherlands, Belgium, and eastern France in mid-September 1944, which would last into the new year, allowed aviation engineers a chance to reorganize and prepare for the upcoming winter season. As expected, they could not build new PHS and SMI airstrips during the fall rain and winter snow seasons because of the moist ground. Besides concrete, the American-made PSP was the only available <b>surfacing</b> <b>material</b> that could be laid down during this inclement weather in Europe.|$|E

50|$|Wood chips can be {{reprocessed}} into {{an extremely}} effective playground <b>surfacing</b> <b>material,</b> or impact-attenuation surface. When used as playground surfacing (soft fall, cushion fall, or play chip, {{as it is}} sometimes known), woodchips can be very effective in lessening the impact of falls from playground equipment. When spread to depths of one foot (30 centimeters) playground wood chips can be effective at reducing impacts in falls up to 11 feet (3 meters). Playground woodchip is also an environmentally friendly alternative to rubber type playground surfaces.|$|E
50|$|After {{the initial}} batch of airfields was {{completed}} using SMT, the Army aviation engineers switched {{almost exclusively to}} another <b>surfacing</b> <b>material</b> known as prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing (PBS). Light and easily transportable, PBS did not create the dust problem encountered with SMT fields. Made of an asphalt-impregnated jute delivered in rolls 300 feet in length and 36 inches or 43 inches in width, PBS was laid in overlapping layers to produce a dust-free fair weather surface. It was also common to build airstrips using both SMT and PBS, laying SMT on top.|$|E
