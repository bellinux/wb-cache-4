Some wine labels suggest opening the bottle and letting the wine [...] "breathe" [...] {{for a couple of hours}} before serving, while others recommend drinking it immediately. Decanting (the act of pouring a wine into a <b>special</b> <b>container</b> just for breathing) is a controversial subject among wine enthusiasts. In addition to aeration, decanting with a filter allows the removal of bitter sediments that may have formed in the wine. Sediment is more common in older bottles, but aeration may benefit younger wines.|$|E
