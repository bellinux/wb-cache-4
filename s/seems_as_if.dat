5|$|Lucy only {{appears in}} the second half of the poem, where she is linked with the English landscape. As such, it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> nature joins with the narrator in {{mourning}} for her, and the reader is drawn into this mutual sorrow.|$|E
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} time, it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{the dog is}} cured, in {{that he is now}} {{friendly}} towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner, who has come to claim him, and who presumably trained him to attack black people. She angrily tells him in front of his grandchildren, who only know the dog as a loving family pet, that the dog has been cured by a black man.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to copying and restoring portraits, the serjeant-painters also undertook decorative tasks, {{such as the}} painting of banners and stage scenery. Parchment rolls of the Office of the Works record that De Critz oversaw the decorating of royal houses and palaces. Since Peake’s work is not recorded there, it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> De Critz took responsibility for the more decorative tasks, while Peake continued {{his work as a}} royal portrait painter. However, Peake and Paul Isackson painted the cabins, carvings, and armorials on the ship the Prince Royal in 1611.|$|E

This in {{particular}} would <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> made {{with some kind of}} sharp wedge; the flesh round it <b>seems</b> torn <b>as</b> <b>if</b> with lateral pressure." ...|$|R

5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he has been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience {{and goes on to}} steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
5|$|Half-Life 2 {{picks up}} the story, in which the G-Man takes Freeman out of stasis and inserts him on a train en route to City 17 an {{indeterminate}} number of years after {{the events of the}} first game, with Earth now enslaved by the transhuman forces of the Combine. The player guides Gordon to aid in humanity's struggle against the Combine and its human representative, Dr. Wallace Breen. He oversees the occupation from his base of operations in the Citadel, a monolithic building at the heart of City17. Fighting alongside Gordon is an underground resistance led by former colleague Dr. Eli Vance, as well other allies including Dr. Vance's daughter Alyx Vance and the enigmatic Vortigaunts, an alien species. Half-Life 2 ends with a climactic battle atop the Citadel that inflicts critical damage to its dark fusion reactor. When it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Alyx and Gordon are to be engulfed by the explosion, the G-Man appears once more. After giving a cryptic speech, he extracts Gordon from danger and places him in stasis once again.|$|E
25|$|In 1590 when Aodh Ruadh Ó Domhnaill (Red Hugh O'Donnell) {{was held}} in Dublin Castle, his half-brother, Domhnall, {{attempted}} to wrest Tír Conaill from his father Aodh. Aodh Ruadh's mother in response mustered a large force of Scots and also the Mac Suibhne branches of Na Tuatha and Fanad to oppose Domhnall. During this time Donnchadh. lord of Banagh took Domhnall's side, along with Ó Baoighill. The opposing forces met near Glencolumbkille, in September 1590, and Domhnall's force was defeated. By 1592 Aodh Ruadh was in power of Tír Conaill and it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Donnchadh was pardoned for opposing him, as Donnchadh was present at Aodh Ruadh's inauguration at Kilmacrenan.|$|E

25|$|T-72Z/Type 72Z/Safir-74 - Iranian {{upgraded}} T-54/55 and Type-59 (Chinese {{copy of the}} T-54A), T-72Z {{being the}} name given to the upgraded T-55s, Safir 74 being the name given to the upgraded T-54s and Type 72Z being the name given to the upgraded Type-59s. The upgrades Include the new fire control system Fotona EFCS-3B (with laser rangefinder, cross-wind sensor, ballistic computer and gunner's passive night vision device), a 105mm tank gun, side skirts, smoke grenade launchers, ERA package, a new power-pack with 780hp 12-cylinder V-46-6 diesel engine and new tracks. Iranian sources state {{there was also a}} plan to arm the tanks with a 2A46 125mm tank gun, but it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> this project was canceled.|$|E
25|$|Psycho-physical {{parallelism}} is a {{very unusual}} view about the interaction between mental and physical events which was most prominently, and perhaps only truly, advocated by Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz. Like Malebranche and others before him, Leibniz recognized the weaknesses of Descartes' account of causal interaction taking place in a physical location in the brain. Malebranche decided that such a material basis of interaction between material and immaterial was impossible and therefore formulated his doctrine of occasionalism, stating that the interactions were really caused by the intervention of God on each individual occasion. Leibniz's idea is that God has created a pre-established harmony such that it only <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> physical and mental events cause, and are caused by, one another. In reality, mental causes only have mental effects and physical causes only have physical effects. Hence the term parallelism is used to describe this view.|$|E
25|$|The fashion {{industry}} is a prime target of body image issues, with models often facing second-hand criticism. Fashion industry insiders believe that clothes hang better on tall, thin women; however, critics argue that catwalk models communicate an unhealthy and unrealistic body image to the public. In the world of fashion, it often <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> measurements, or the number or alphabet carried defines an individual. Based on a survey participated by 13 to 17 year olds in the U.S., 90% “felt pressured by fashion and media industries to be skinny”, with 65% believing that the body image portrayed were too thin. Furthermore, more than 60% habitually compare themselves to models, while 46% will strive to achieve it. The underlying issue with brands featuring underweight models, therefore revolves around expressing “the message that an unhealthy body type is the most socially valued”. For eating disorders sufferers, viewing these images could consequently strengthen desires to lose weight.|$|E

60|$|When {{the coroner}} asked the hall porter about the stick {{and the man}} gave his reply, Luke turned and met Louisa's fixed gaze. The marble-like stillness of his face {{remained}} unchanged, only the eyes <b>seemed</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they darkened visibly. At least to her it <b>seemed</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a velvety shadow crept over them, an inscrutable, an un-understandable shadow, and the rims assumed a purple hue.|$|R

25|$|In {{numerous}} {{cases in}} both the 1794 print and the 1795 print, it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the acid has eaten away {{too much of the}} relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and wash, often touching the text and design outlines with pen. This ink and wash work may have been executed in 1818, along with the addition of the frame lines, although this cannot be ascertained for certain. Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary colour printing, a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of white line engraving, a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be eaten away by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.|$|E
25|$|All Religions are One {{comprises}} ten plates, each {{of which}} is roughly 5.4 X 4cm., with each paragraph on a separate plate, except Plate 10, which contains both Principal 7d and a short paragraph which functions as a conclusion to the series. In numerous cases, it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the acid has eaten away too much of the relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and wash, often touching the text and design outlines with pen.

500|$|In {{the weeks}} before Lincoln's assassination, Whitman {{observed}} the planet Venus shining brightly in the evening sky. He later wrote of the observation, [...] "Nor earth nor sky ever knew spectacles of superber beauty {{than some of the}} nights lately here. The western star, Venus, in the earlier hours of evening, has never been so large, so clear; it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it told something, as if it held rapport indulgent with humanity, with us Americans" [...] In the poem, Whitman describes the disappearance of the star: ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opened to}} laudatory reviews from the {{television}} critic community, with much praise reserved for John Slattery's direction and the acting work of Vincent Kartheiser. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, his highest grade for the season so far, calling it [...] "transfixing and incredible" [...] and [...] "season five's first instant classic". He praised {{the symbol of the}} dripping faucet as well as the editing choices that suggested [...] "the way that time passes, so that it almost <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you’ve lost yourself in the mists of your own life". Alan Sepinwall, writing for HitFix, exalted Slattery's [...] "strong command of the comedic moments", and recognized that [...] "most of the carnage" [...] of the episode [...] "comes out of failed attempts by Pete, Lane and Ken to be more than they are by building bridges from one world to another." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Led Zeppelin II was not positive originally. John Mendelsohn wrote a negative {{review of the}} record for Rolling Stone, in which he mocked the group's heavy sound and white blues, while writing that [...] "until you've listened to the album eight hundred times, as I have, it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it's just one especially heavy song extended over the space of two whole sides". Robert Christgau jokingly referred to the band as [...] "the best of the wah-wah [...] groups, so dirty they drool on demand", while complaining that [...] "all the songs sound alike". He nonetheless conceded that [...] "Led Zeppelin simply out-heavied everyone" [...] in 1969, [...] "pitting Jimmy Page's repeated low-register fuzz riffs against the untiring freak intensity of Robert Plant's vocal. This trademark has only emerged clearly on the second album, {{and more and more}} I am coming to understand it as an artistic triumph." ...|$|E

500|$|Vonnegut's {{difficulties}} materialized {{in numerous}} ways; most distinctly though, was the painfully slow progress {{he was making}} on his next novel, the darkly comical Breakfast of Champions. In 1971, Vonnegut stopped writing the novel altogether. When it was finally released in 1973, it was panned critically. In Thomas S. Hischak's book American Literature on Stage and Screen, Breakfast of Champions was called [...] "funny and outlandish", but reviewers noted that it [...] "lacks substance {{and seems to be}} an exercise in literary playfulness." [...] Vonnegut's 1976 novel Slapstick, which meditates on the relationship between him and his sister (Alice), met a similar fate. In The New York Timess review of Slapstick, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said Vonnegut [...] "seems to be putting less effort into [...] than ever before", and that [...] "it still <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he has given up storytelling after all." [...] At times, Vonnegut was disgruntled by the personal nature of his detractors' complaints.|$|E
500|$|Upon arriving, {{the quartet}} takes {{a back door}} into the Wizard's {{quarters}} and discovers {{that he is a}} [...] "phony". The [...] "great and powerful Oz" [...] is actually Herman Smith, a failed politician from Atlantic City, New Jersey, who was transported to Oz when a balloon he was flying to promote his campaign to become the city dogcatcher was lost in a storm. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion are distraught that they will never receive their respective brain, heart, and courage, but Dorothy makes them realize that they already have had these things all along. Just as it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she {{will never be able to}} get home, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, appears and implores her to find her way home by searching within and using the magic of the silver slippers by clicking the heels together three times. After thanking Glinda and saying goodbye to her friends, she takes clicks her heels together three times. She is then back near home with Toto in her arms and walks into the apartment.|$|E
500|$|Commenting on the combat, Paprocki {{said that}} despite the {{simplified}} combo system, the developers have [...] "managed to infuse the sheer brutality and force God of War is known for {{within the confines of}} the [...] platform." [...] Because of the simplified system, situations which call for Kratos' magical abilities are rare. [...] However, if players do choose to use these abilities, selecting them is a [...] "burden in the haste of a battle", requiring players to cycle through their entire inventory. Paprocki also criticized the lack of an autosave feature, as the game does not save the player's position when receiving a phone call, which [...] "can lead to unbearable frustration." [...] Freeman said that the combination of the weapons and quick time events make the combat [...] "a convincing interpretation of the action in the original console games". Davis said that although there are puzzle and platforming elements, the focus is [...] "clearly on the combat" [...] and felt that the combat system was [...] "a little shallow". He said it <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the abundance of enemies [...] "exist solely to act as punching (or slicing, as it were) bags for Kratos".|$|E
