5|$|Another {{significant}} human {{impact is}} roadkill—dead turtles, especially females, are commonly seen on summer roads. In addition to direct killing, roads genetically isolate some populations. Localities {{have tried to}} limit roadkill by constructing underpasses, highway barriers, and crossing signs.

5|$|The {{opening of}} the Great Western Railway in 1841 removed much of the canal's traffic, and in 1852 the railway company took over its running. Bath Spa railway station is the {{principal}} railway station in Bath. It was built in 1840 by Brunel. It is in an asymmetrical Tudor style with curving gables, and lies on the north bank of the Avon, with the line <b>swerving</b> elegantly across from the southern bank to the station and then back again.|$|E

5000|$|The {{question}} remains how random <b>swerves</b> {{can help to}} explain free action. In her 1992 book, The Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind, Julia Annas wrote: ...since <b>swerves</b> are random, {{it is hard to}} see how they help to explain free action. We can scarcely expect there to be a random <b>swerve</b> before every free action. Free actions are frequent, and (fairly) reliable. Random <b>swerves</b> cannot account for either of these features. This problem would be lessened if we could assume that <b>swerves</b> are very frequent, so that there is always likely to be one around before an action. However, if <b>swerves</b> are frequent, we face the problem that stones and trees ought to be enabled to act freely. And even in the case of humans random <b>swerves</b> would seem to produce, if anything, random actions; we still lack any clue as to how they could produce actions which are free.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in 1952, the bonfires were {{constructed}} entirely from fresh-cut logs. The event suffered its first fatality in 1955, {{when a student}} {{was struck by a}} <b>swerving</b> car. The same year (for unrelated reasons), Bonfire was moved from Simpson Drill Field in front of the Memorial Student Center to Duncan Field, near the dorms of the Corps of Cadets (whose leaders oversaw construction). In 1957, the structure collapsed two days before Bonfire was to be held, but students worked around-the-clock to rebuild it, and the bonfire burned as scheduled.|$|E
5|$|Nelson Piquet Jr. won {{the pole}} {{position}} by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and maintained his startline advantage {{on the first}} lap. He {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field and held first place until he collided with a barrier after <b>swerving</b> to avoid José María López's crashed car on the 17th lap allowing Sam Bird to move into the lead. Some drivers elected to make pit stops to switch to their second cars with Bird choosing to remain on the circuit until his own stop eight laps later. He had technical problems with his second car and Buemi inherited the first position. Di Grassi was no more than two seconds behind Buemi but was unable to get close enough to challenge him because he had to conserve electrical energy usage and Buemi remained the leader for the rest of the race to win. There were three lead changes among four different drivers during the course of the race.|$|E
5|$|The return {{match at}} Anfield took place the {{following}} week. Celtic's Alan Thompson and Liverpool's Dietmar Hamann both {{came close to}} scoring for their respective sides in the opening quarter-hour with long range shots. On 19 minutes, Jerzy Dudek turned a 30-yard free kick from Henrik Larsson around the post. Two minutes from half time, Celtic were awarded a free kick 25 yards from goal. Thompson struck a low shot past Dudek from the set piece, with the ball going under the defensive wall, which had jumped up and appeared to distract the Liverpool goalkeeper. Celtic sealed their victory on 82 minutes when John Hartson played a one-two with Larsson, and then drove a <b>swerving</b> shot from 25 yards out into the top-right corner of Dudek's goal. Celtic's 20 win saw them win the tie 31 on aggregate and progress to the semi-finals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Swerve</b> {{made another}} {{appearance}} as the fifteenth Alternator, {{where he was}} a red redeco of the Chevrolet Corvette C5 Z06 Tracks with a new head sculpt.

5|$|German Bundesliga team VfB Stuttgart were Celtic's fourth round {{opponents in}} the Spring of 2003. Celtic came from behind to win the first leg 3–1 at Parkhead, while in the second leg, despite Celtic going up 2–0 early, a {{comeback}} from Stuttgart saw the Bundesliga side win 3–2 on the night, although Celtic would progress 5–4 on aggregate. The quarter-finals saw another English Premier League opponent for Celtic, this time Liverpool. The first leg took place at Celtic Park on 13 March 2003, ending 1–1 through a first-minute Larsson goal; the away goal, however, gave Liverpool an advantage entering their home tie at Anfield. In the first leg, Liverpool player El Hadji Diouf spat at a Celtic supporter, and was later fined £5,000 at Glasgow's Sheriff Court for the incident. The return match at Anfield took place the following week. Two minutes from half-time, Celtic were awarded a free-kick 25 yards from goal. Alan Thompson struck a low shot past Jerzy Dudek from the set piece, with the ball going under the defensive wall which had jumped up and appeared to distract the Liverpool goalkeeper. Celtic sealed a 20 victory on 82 minutes when John Hartson played a one-two with Larsson, then drove a <b>swerving</b> shot from 25 yards out into the top-right corner of Dudek's goal.|$|E

25|$|A player {{could also}} try to get around a defender by stepping, <b>swerving,</b> or goose-stepping past them. To sidestep a defender, the attacking player takes a wide step in one {{direction}} while running forward and then shifts their body weight in the opposite direction. If successful the defender will be off balance, allowing the attacker to accelerate past. When <b>swerving,</b> an attacker runs straight at the defender, but before making contact accelerates and sways to the outside. Although similar to a side step, the swerve involves less sideways movement, but results in less loss of speed. The goose-step is a move made famous by David Campese and involves slowing down while running {{on the outside of}} the opponent, causing them to also slow, before accelerating away.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{case for}} a {{coordination}} game is choosing {{the sides of the}} road upon which to drive, a social standard which can save lives if it is widely adhered to. In a simplified example, assume that two drivers meet on a narrow dirt road. Both have to swerve in order to avoid a head-on collision. If both execute the same <b>swerving</b> maneuver they will manage to pass each other, but if they choose differing maneuvers they will collide. In the payoff matrix in Fig. 2, successful passing is represented by a payoff of 10, and a collision by a payoff of 0.|$|E

25|$|The {{draw for}} the Sixth Round {{took place on}} 18 February 2008, and drew United at home against Portsmouth. The tie, which was the only all-Premier League tie of the round, was played on 8 March 2008. United went into the game with the {{prospect}} of another Treble still on the cards, and started the match full of confidence. However, when the referee, Martin Atkinson, failed to award the Red Devils a penalty in the seventh minute after Sylvain Distin clearly bodychecked Cristiano Ronaldo, it was clear that {{it was not to be}} United's day. United continued to produce the better of the chances in the first half – Portsmouth's best effort was a <b>swerving</b> 25-yarder from Pedro Mendes that tested Van der Sar to the extent that the Dutch keeper injured himself and had to be substituted at half-time.|$|E
25|$|Despite Beckham's {{achievements}} in the 1998–99 season, {{he was still}} unpopular among some opposition fans and journalists, and he was criticised after being sent off for a deliberate foul in Manchester United's World Club Championship match against Necaxa. It was suggested in the press {{that his wife was}} a bad influence on him, and that it might be in United's interests to sell him, but his manager publicly backed him and he stayed at the club. During the 1999–2000 season, there was a talk of a transfer to Juventus in Italy, but this never happened. Beckham helped United retain the Premier League title in 1999–2000 by an 18-point margin – after being pushed by Arsenal and Leeds United for much of the season. United won their final 11 league games of the season, with Beckham scoring five goals during this run, with his last goal coming from a <b>swerving</b> shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area in their final home game against Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009–10 Premier League season, Essien {{put in an}} {{excellent}} performance against Blackburn Rovers on 24 October 2009 and scored his first goal {{of the season with}} a <b>swerving</b> 35-yard shot on 52 minutes in a 5–0 victory at Stamford Bridge. He scored his first brace for Chelsea against Wolverhampton Wanderers with a header and a low shot from outside the box, and came close to completing his first hat-trick for the club with a flurry of second half shots, one of which was tipped onto the bar by Wolves goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey. Essien was injured on international duty during the 2010 African Nations Cup and missed the remainder of the English domestic season. On 4 June 2010, he signed a two-year extension to his existing contract which would have kept him at the club until 2015. Essien returned to action on 17 July 2010 in a friendly against Crystal Palace, and scored the only goal of the match to give Chelsea the win.|$|E
