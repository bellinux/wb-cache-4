25|$|Pyrethroids are direct stimulators {{of sodium}} {{channels}} in neuronal cells, inducing rapid depolarization and <b>spastic</b> <b>paralysis</b> leading to death. The effect is {{specific to the}} parasite since the drugs used are only slowly absorbed by the host and rapidly metabolized once absorbed. Cypermethrin (Excis, Betamax) and deltamethrin (Alphamax) are the two pyrethroids commonly used to control sea lice. Resistance to pyrethroids {{has been reported in}} Norway and appears to be due to a mutation leading to a structural change in the sodium channel which prevents pyrethroids from activating the channel. Use of deltamethrin has been increasing as an alternate treatment with the rise in resistance observed with emamectin benzoate.|$|E
500|$|The virus {{enters the}} central nervous system in about 1 percent of infections. Most {{patients}} with CNS involvement develop nonparalytic aseptic meningitis, with symptoms of headache, neck, back, abdominal and extremity pain, fever, vomiting, lethargy, and irritability. About one to five in 1000 cases progress to paralytic disease, in which the muscles become weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and, finally, completely paralyzed; this condition is known as acute flaccid paralysis. [...] Depending on the site of paralysis, paralytic poliomyelitis is classified as spinal, bulbar, or bulbospinal. Encephalitis, an infection of the brain tissue itself, can occur in rare cases, and is usually restricted to infants.

Subsequently, their active moiety (the light chain) is translocated from the endocytic compartment into the cytosol. Here, it cleaves one among three synaptic proteins (viz. the vesicle-associated membrane protein [VAMP]/synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and synaptosomal-associated protein of Mr 25 kDa [SNAP- 25] which are also known under the collective term of SNAREs) involved in docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles at the active zone (i. e., release site...|$|R

40|$|Neuroexcitatory {{peptides}} (NEX) in the A-superfamily of peptides in {{the venom}} of fish-hunting cone snails {{are known to}} cause tetanic <b>paralysis</b> (<b>spastic</b> movements due to overstimulation of neurons). The precise mechanism by which NEX peptides cause tetanic paralysis and their molecular target remains unknown. One prevalent NEX peptide in the prey-injected venom of Conus catus is c 4 a, which is similar in sequence and mass to another NEX peptide of C. catus, c 4 e. Based on previous research done in our lab, we hypothesized that a possible molecular target for NEX peptides is the persistent sodium current. In this study we used a spinal motility assay of larval zebrafish, Danio rerio, to compare the physiological effects of our NEX peptides with pharmacological reagents. We tested two pharmacological reagents: SKA- 31, an activator of certain types of Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels and veratridine, which activates persistent-like sodium currents. Our data showed that at high doses SKA- 31 interferes with the stimulation of the CPG and antagonizes the effect of c 4 a/e in zebrafish larva. This is notable because the activation of Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels interferes with the persistent sodium current. Our data also shows that veratridine induces low levels of c 4 a/e-like spastic activity {{at a very high}} dose suggesting different selectivities of veratridine and c 4 a/e for their targets. Veratridine is the first neuroexcitatory molecule, beside c 4 a/e, to induce motility in our assay. This helps to strengthen our hypothesis that NEX peptides, like c 4 a/e, target the persistent sodium current...|$|R

Encephalitis may also occur after an initial infection with mumps, measles and other childhood diseases, or following a vaccination, or {{as a result of a}} non-infectious process such as poisoning. Since encephalitis affects the brain, which in turn controls all body functions, encephalitis from any cause can show symptoms of general illness throughout the body such as headache, nausea and vomiting, fever, sore throat, and chills. Severe cases begin suddenly and severely and may be followed by stiff neck, drowsiness, trembling, mental confusion, convulsions and coma. Most encephalitis cases recover completely, but others suffer serious after effects such as mental deficiency, <b>spastic</b> or other <b>paralysis,</b> or emotional instability. Some cases die, with babies and the elderly being the most seriously affected. Treatment is symptomatic in most cases as antibiotics cannot kill viruses which are the most common cause of encephalitis.

40|$|Boophone disticha is {{a highly}} {{poisonous}} bulb. It has been used systemically in traditional medical practice in Zimbabwe and neighbouring countries {{for the management of}} various central nervous system conditions including hysteria. Abuse of the plant by teenagers in Zimbabwe for its claimed hallucinogenic effects has also been reported, with the advent of serious toxicity in some cases. The aim of the present work was to describe the symptomatology, neurotoxicological effects and lethality of acute and subacute ingestion and of a hydro-ethanolic plant extract of the bulb of Boophone disticha in rats. Initially, we set out to estimate the LD 50 of this extract using a modified Up-and-down procedure for acute toxicity determination. We then used a Functional Observational Battery (FOB) to identify the neurotoxicological effects of the extract after both acute and repeated oral intake. Additionally we studied the genotoxic potential of the Boophone extract using the Ames test. Finally we sought to investigate the putative neuropharmacological effects i. e. anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like activity in a murine model. Findings in the acute toxicity and neurotoxicological assessment, showedan estimated oral LD 50 of between 120 and 240 mg/kg. For doses of 240 mg/kg and less, signs of toxicity began approximately 10 minutes after gavage, and the most prominent initial signs were head tremors (at 50 mg/kg) and body tremors, severe body tremors(> 360 mg/kg) followed by convulsions. Generally, symptoms of toxicity lasted approximately 2 hours for doses of 240 mg/kg and less; and 3 hours for doses over 240 mg/kg for animals that survived. These results point to a rapid gastrointestinal absorption of the active principles in the plant extract. The most prominent neurotoxicological effects were increased flaccid limb <b>paralysis</b> and <b>spastic</b> hind-limb <b>paralysis.</b> Tachypnoea was noted at low doses and higher doses produced laboured breathing. The retropulsion observed with higher doses could indicate the reported hallucinogenic effects of the plant extract. Subacute assessment showed the similar profile symptoms as with acute toxicity. The main subacute toxic effects of Boophone disticha like the acute effects seem to be mediated via interference with the neuronal pathways especially the central dopaminergic and motor neurons. Target organs, as observed by changes in organ weight appear to be liver, small and large intestines, stomach, central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Boophone disticha extract was genotoxic from concentrations 1000 Î¼g/plate and above with both TA 98 and TA 100 Salmonella typhimurium species irrespective of the metabolic status of the system. The 500 Î¼g/plate concentrations of the Boophone extract were not associated with any genotoxicity and 2500 Î¼g/plate concentration is potential cytotoxic which could have masked the genotoxic effects at this concentration. P a g e | vi Boophone disticha extract showed Anxiolytic-like activity in the elevated plus maze test by significantly changing the percentage time spent in open arms, number of open arm entries, rearing, unprotected head dips and stretch attend postures. The 10 m/kg dose had the most prominent effects compared to the higher dose which were comparable to the positive control. Repeated dosing enhanced the antidepressant-like activity of the Boophone extract. Therefore from the pharmacological findings of our studies, despite being very toxic Boophone disticha proved to be an important source of lead compounds for future drug development. Therefore further investigations are necessary to determine the target site and efficacy of Boophone alkaloids with in vivo models.,This work was supported by IFS grant number F/ 4187 -...|$|R

Abstract The inspection of 114 children is carried out: 102 children with children's cerebral paralysis at the age of 3 - 10 years: 55 children at the age of 3 - 10 years (milk dentition), 47 children at the age of 6 - 10 years (mixed dentition) and 12 clinically healthy children with the physiological bite. In children with children's cerebral infantile paralysis the frequency of maxillodental anomalies on the average composes 61, 7 %, from them 52, 9 % composed the anomalies of bite. In children with children's cerebral infantile paralysis are established the high indices of the intensity of caries of milk and permanent teeth, inflammatory diseases of the tissues of periodontium and the poor level of the hygiene of the mouth cavity, and so the delay of the mineralization of the roots of permanent teeth. In children with children's cerebral infantile paralysis and dentoalveolar anomalies is increased the tone of masticatory muscles, which testifies about the disturbance of muscular equilibrium and need of using the myofunctional orthodontic appliances. The purpose of the research. To study the prevalence and intensity of dental caries, incidence of dentoalveolar anomalies, the state of oral hygiene and periodontium children with children’s cerebral infantile paralysis. Material and methods. The inspection of 114 children is carried out. The intensity and prevalence of caries teeth, periodontal tissue condition and the delay of the mineralization of the roots of permanent teeth were studied. Conclusions. Analysis of research suggests that children with children’s cerebral infantile paralysis frequency dentoalveolar anomalies on average 61, 7 %. High caries intensity determined in all age groups. All children surveyed had a poor oral hygiene, which accompanied by inflammation of the periodontal tissues. Assessments of maturity stages of permanent teeth in children with children’s cerebral infantile paralysis indicate delay mineralization roots of permanent teeth.
