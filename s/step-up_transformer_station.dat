The nacelle {{containing}} the gearbox and generator {{is mounted on}} a tubular steel 80 m tower. The assembly of blades, hub, gearbox, and generator, in total weighs around 220 tonnes. The blades turn at 14 revolutions per minute when the generator is turning at 1200 RPM; the speed increase makes the generator more compact and the overall system more efficient. Each tower has a 4 m concrete foundation which extends between 10 and 15 m below grade. The generators produce AC power at around 600 Volts and 60 Hertz. Each tower has a step-up transformer connecting the turbine by an underground cable to the 35 kV overhead wood pole line collection network. The collection network connects the turbines to a <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> <b>station,</b> where the voltage is increase to 230 kV and connection is made to the Manitoba Hydro transmission network.

40|$|Abstract: Conventional {{high-voltage}} generators {{are designed}} with voltage levels rated to maximum of 30 kV. The power grids with voltages as high as 1, 100 kV cannot be directly supplied from these generators, power <b>step-up</b> <b>transformers</b> are used to transform the generated voltage to high transmission voltage level suitable for the interface with the transmission grid. These transformers impose significant drawbacks on the power plant as a whole- reduction in efficiency, high maintenance costs, more space, less availability, and an increased environmental impact. During the last century, a number of attempts were made at developing a high-voltage generator, the Powerformer, that could be connected directly to the power grid, without <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer.</b> When XLPE-insulated cables were introduced in the 1960 s there were some initial problems with their reliability, caused by poor control of the manufacturing processes. These problems have since been overcome, and today’s high-voltage XLPE-insulated cables have an impressive track record. Therefore, {{the development of the}} Powerformer is inherently linked to the reliability and the development of the XLPE insulated cables. The powerformer has opened a new technological chapter in the generation and transmission of electrical energy. The technological advantage offered by the powerformer was studied in good detail and their impact on reliability in particular and environment in general was highlighted.
