5|$|Because {{of their}} size, shape, and {{well-defined}} chemical structures, viruses {{have been used}} as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify <b>signals</b> <b>in</b> DNA microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. Another example is the use of CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.|$|E

5|$|Many arctiid moths make clicks when hunted by echolocating bats; {{they also}} often contain {{unpalatable}} chemicals. Some such as dogbane tiger moths (Cycnia tenera) have ears and conspicuous coloration, {{and start to}} make clicks when echolocating bats approach. An experiment by Canadian zoologists John M. Ratcliffe and James H. Fullard, using dogbane tiger moths and northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis), suggests the <b>signals</b> <b>in</b> fact both disrupt echolocation and warn of chemical defence. The behaviour of these insects is thus both deimatic and aposematic.|$|E

5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic <b>signals</b> <b>in</b> blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E

We discuss the physiology and alterations of calcium <b>signaling</b> <b>in</b> interstitial cells, and in particular in telocytes. We describe the physiological contribution of calcium <b>signaling</b> <b>in</b> interstitial cells to the pacemaking activity (e. g., intestinal, urinary, uterine or vascular pacemaking activity) and to the reproductive function.

40|$|Hepatic Notch {{signaling}} is inappropriately activated in obese/ insulin-resistant mouse models. Genetic or pharmacologic in-hibition of hepatic Notch <b>signaling</b> <b>in</b> obese mice simultaneously improves glucose {{tolerance and}} reduces hepatic triglyceride content. As such, we predicted that Notch <b>signaling</b> <b>in</b> human liver would be {{positively associated with}} insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Here, we systematically survey Notch <b>signaling</b> <b>in</b> liver biopsy specimens, and show active Notch <b>signaling</b> <b>in</b> lean and obese adults, with expression of multiple Notch receptors and ligands. In morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, we show that Notch activation positively correlates with glucose- 6 -phosphatase (G 6 PC) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy-kinase (PCK 1) expression, key regulators of hepatic glucose out-put.

5|$|As Krovanh was {{approaching}} the Philippines, Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau cautioned {{the residents of}} the island against strong winds and warning ships in the Bashi Channel. After the typhoon entered the South China Sea, sea warnings were issued for areas offshore Hainan. Additional warnings were issued and expanded as Krovanh moved closer to the Chinese coast. In preparation for the storm, shipping routes across the Qiongzhou Strait were suspended, while security measures for river dykes and reservoirs were strengthened in both Hainan and Guangdong. In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a Standby Signal No.1 on August23, which was upgraded to a Strong Wind Signal No.3 at around noon the following day.

40|$|Hedgehog (Hh) {{signaling}} regulates multiple {{aspects of}} metazoan development and tissue homeostasis, and is constitutively active in numerous cancers. We identified Ubr 3, an E 3 ubiquitin ligase, as a novel, positive regulator of Hh <b>signaling</b> <b>in</b> Drosophila and vertebrates. Hh signaling regulates the Ubr 3 -mediated poly-ubiquitination and degradation of Cos 2, a central component of Hh <b>signaling.</b> <b>In</b> developing Drosophila eye discs, loss of ubr 3 {{leads to a}} delayed differentiation of photoreceptors and a reduction <b>in</b> Hh <b>signaling.</b> <b>In</b> zebrafish, loss of Ubr 3 causes a decrease <b>in</b> Shh <b>signaling</b> <b>in</b> the developing eyes, somites, and sensory neurons. However, not all tissues that require Hh <b>signaling</b> are affected <b>in</b> zebrafish. Mouse UBR 3 poly-ubiquitinates Kif 7, the mammalian homologue of Cos 2. Finally, loss of UBR 3 up-regulates Kif 7 protein levels and decreases Hh <b>signaling</b> <b>in</b> cultured cells. In summary, our work identifies Ubr 3 as a novel, evolutionarily conserved modulator of Hh signaling that boosts Hh in some tissues...|$|R

5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad <b>signals</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century.

In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E
5|$|In Escherichia coli, SOS {{boxes are}} 20-nucleotide long {{sequences}} near promoters with palindromic structure {{and a high}} degree of sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short <b>signals</b> <b>in</b> the genome. The high information content of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response. The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response. The error-prone translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD'2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later on as a last resort. Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer, which then binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression.|$|E

It intercepted radio <b>signals</b> <b>in</b> the hamlet of Ap Tan Thoi in Dinh Tuong Province where the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was headquartered. The radio intercept and other information obtained by Jim Drummond, Vann's intelligence officer, indicated that the Viet Cong were using Ap Tan Thoi as a headquarters location. Furthermore, South Vietnamese and American intelligence personnel believed the Viet Cong had deployed a reinforced company of about 120 men to protect the transmitter. Certain that the Viet Cong unit was no larger than the reported number, the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was instructed to attack Ap Tan Thoi.|$|E
5|$|Semaphore signals {{were used}} on the very first railway lines, but only a bare minimum were {{provided}} as the time interval system being relied upon instead. The first interlocking of signals to protect trains was provided in 1874, as before this time conflicting moves could be made. The design of the signals also progressed, with the disc type siding signals first introduced in 1885, and the lower quadrant somersault type main line signals adopted in 1887, {{both of which are}} still in use today. Green was not adopted as the All Right colour until 1898, with white being used before this time. Red was the usual colour of all signal arms, until yellow was chosen as the colour for distant <b>signals</b> <b>in</b> 1926, with full adoption made in 1930.
