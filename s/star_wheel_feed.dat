In this grinding method, workpiece surface speed and sum of both wheel working surface speed and <b>wheel</b> <b>feed</b> rate crossed each other.

40|$|The single screw {{compressor}} {{is used in}} many fields such as air compression, chemical industry and refrigeration. During operation, different gas pressures and temperatures applied on the components can cause different degrees of deformation, {{which leads to a}} difference between the thermally induced clearance and the designed clearance. However, limited research about clearance design is reported. In this paper, a temperature measurement instrument and a convective heat transfer model were described and used to establish the temperature of a single screw air compressor’s casing, screw rotor and <b>star</b> <b>wheel.</b> 3 -D models of these three main components were built. The gas force deformation, thermal-structure deformation and thermal-force coupling deformation were carried out by using a finite element simulation method. Results show that the clearance between the bottom of the groove and the top of <b>star</b> <b>wheel</b> is reduced by 0. 066 mm, the clearance between the side of groove and the <b>star</b> <b>wheel</b> is reduced by 0. 015 mm, and the clearance between the cylinder and the rotor is reduced by 0. 01 mm. It is suggested that these deformations should be taken into account during the design of these clearances...|$|R

40|$|The wear of <b>star</b> <b>wheel</b> teeth is an {{importance}} {{issue in the}} single screw compressor. In order to enhance the wearresistance of <b>star</b> <b>wheel</b> teeth, some new profiles of the meshing pair were proposed to replace the currently used straight line envelope profile, such as single column envelope, multi-straight line (or multi-column) envelope. In this paper, a curved surface of the tooth flank is suggested. The groove flank is the envelope surface corresponding to the curved surface of the tooth flank. Section profile of the new tooth flank is a curved line, which could be elliptical, hyperbolic or involute. During the tooth meshing with the groove, the contact line between the tooth flank and the groove flank could {{move back and forth}} in the whole area of the tooth flank. This design is expected to improve the lubricating between the tooth flank and the groove flank, and to prolong the service life of the single screw compressor. Geometric and kinematic investigation of the <b>star</b> <b>wheel</b> and the screw rotor is established. And a new designed tooth flank of the meshing pair is introduced in this paper. Numerical control high-velocity cutting technology is suggested to fabricate the new star-wheel and the screw rotor...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the wear {{resistance}} of the meshing pair in Single Screw Compressor, our team developed the 2 ̆ 2 multi-cylinders compound profile 2 ̆ 2 {{which could be used}} in the meshing pair instead of the traditional profile. In this paper, the reliability and utility of the new profile was verified by an experiment. In this experiment, a designed multi-cylinders compound profile meshing pair was applied in an oil-flooded single screw air compressor as the experimental prototype, then the prototype ran 2000 hours continuously in the experimental platform. and the displacement was detected with changing discharge pressure and rotating speed. It is shown that the prototype has a steady displacement, and the energy efficiency grade is very close to the best grade. The displacement is slightly reduced with the discharge pressure arising, but the reduction is far less than the original single line profile meshing pair machine. These prove that the new pair has good sealing performance. A comparative observation on the <b>star</b> <b>wheel</b> profile is conducted at the end of test, and the results demonstrate that the nodular cast iron <b>star</b> <b>wheel</b> new designed has high wear resistant property and good hydrodynamic lubrication characteristic. Thus, the nodular cast iron {{can be used to make}} <b>star</b> <b>wheel</b> to reduce the cost of the single screw instead of the expensive PEEK material...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a mechanism with the following specifications: continuous alternate motion, wide motion phases with constant angular velocity, parallel input and output shafts, and great strokes. Those specifications derive from a possible application in the textile field. The mechanism is composed of two <b>star</b> <b>wheels</b> properly coupled together: there are two counter-rotating input wheels, alternately coupling with slots first, then teeth at each side of the output wheel. As usual for <b>star</b> <b>wheels,</b> pins and slots handle the acceleration and deceleration phases, while the constant velocity phase is performed by coupling sectors of toothed gears. A proper design of pins and slots is performed, so {{that at the same time}} when a pin from one input wheel is releasing a slot, a pin from the other input wheel engages a slot on the other side of the output wheel, forcing the latter to an opposite motion. In this way the output wheel has a continuous and smooth alternate motion. By annihilating the arrest phases typical of <b>star</b> <b>wheels,</b> the proposed system eliminates the discontinuities in the acceleration diagram. The paper develops a complete parametrical analysis of the device, underlining the effect of the constraints on the shape of the motion laws with particular emphasis on the acceleration and deceleration phases. In this way the output wheel has a continuous and smooth alternate motion. With respect to an analogous mechanism realizing the same laws of motion, e. g., cams, this device is very compact and economical, also presenting parallel input and output shafts, and significantly reduces sliding and wea...|$|R
