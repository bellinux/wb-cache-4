60|$|It was battle without quarter--a massacre. The scabs {{and their}} protectors, surrounded, backed against Saxon's fence, fought like cornered rats, {{but could not}} {{withstand}} the rush of a hundred men. Clubs and pick-handles were swinging, revolvers were exploding, and cobblestones were flung with crushing effect at arm's distance. Saxon saw young Frank Davis, a friend of Bert's and a father of several months' <b>standing,</b> <b>press</b> the muzzle of his revolver against a scab's stomach and fire. There were curses and snarls of rage, wild cries of terror and pain. Mercedes was right. These things were not men. They were beasts, fighting over bones, destroying one another for bones.|$|E
5000|$|Strict press: Also {{called the}} {{military}} press or <b>standing</b> <b>press,</b> the kettlebell {{is held in}} the rack position and pushed overhead with one arm, keeping the body rigid. The tree press, a press standing on one leg, performs a similar function. Other variations include the walking press, taking a step forward with each press, perhaps alternating hands, and the seated press, where the trainee sits {{on the ground with}} straight legs while pressing overhead.|$|E

Get-ups are sometimes combined to make get-up presses, with a press at each position of the get-up: floor press, leaning seated press, high bridge press, single-leg kneeling press, <b>standing</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E

50|$|Although {{in early}} 1998 {{he was still}} able to do five reps in the bench press with 495 lbs, three reps in the squat with 855 lbs (with no suit and no knee wraps), and three reps in the <b>standing</b> <b>press</b> with 405 lbs in training, while {{traveling}} with the World Wrestling Federation, he never returned to compete again in official championships in favor of his wrestling career. He weighed 380 lbs at that time, and his right upper arm was measured at 24” by Terry Todd. By basically ending his lifting career at the age of 26, it is probable that he never reached his full physical potential as a professional lifter. Henry remains the youngest man in history to squat more than 900 pounds without a squat suit as well as the youngest to total more than 2,300 pounds raw - he's the only person ever to have accomplished any of these feats at under 25 years of age.|$|E

5000|$|Tresadern, a left-half, {{began his}} career with non-league Wanstead, moving on to Barking Town before joining West Ham United in July 1913. He {{was part of the}} West Ham side elected to the Football League in 1919 and became a regular in their league side. Tresadern made his England debut in April 1923, in the 2-2 Home International draw with Scotland, {{although}} he was not pleased with his performance. [...] "I was the best player Scotland had on the field", he said. He was part of the West Ham side that lost to Bolton Wanderers in the first ever FA Cup final to be held at Wembley. After just two minutes Tresadern became entangled in the crowd after taking a throw-in and was unable to return to the pitch immediately. This gave Bolton's David Jack the opportunity to shoot for goal, this shot beat West Ham goalkeeper Ted Hufton to give Bolton the lead, and hit a spectator who was <b>standing</b> <b>pressed</b> against the goal net, knocking him unconscious.|$|R

500|$|Both teams {{employed}} the 2-3-5 formation {{typical of the}} era: two full-backs, three half-backs, comprising one centre-half and two wing-halves, and five forwards, comprising two outside-forwards, two inside-forwards and a centre-forward. [...] West Ham's game plan initially centred on the two fast-moving outside-forwards Dick Richards and Jimmy Ruffell, but Bolton set out from the start to keep the two players contained, rushing at them whenever they got the ball. [...] After just two minutes West Ham half-back Jack Tresadern became entangled in the crowd after taking a throw-in {{and was unable to}} return to the pitch immediately. [...] This gave Bolton's David Jack the opportunity to shoot for goal. [...] His shot beat West Ham goalkeeper Ted Hufton to give Bolton the lead, and hit a spectator who was <b>standing</b> <b>pressed</b> against the goal net, knocking him unconscious. Three minutes later Vic Watson received the ball a few yards in front of the Bolton goal but his shot flew over the crossbar. Eleven minutes into the game the crowd surged forward once again and a large number of fans encroached onto the pitch, leading to the suspension of play while the mounted police again cleared the playing area. A number of fans required first aid from members of the British Red Cross while the players looked on and awaited the resumption of play. Policemen patrolled the perimeter of the pitch to keep it clear for the linesmen, after play was resumed.|$|R

40|$|Click on {{the link}} to access this {{abstract}} at the publisher's website. Serratus anterior (SA) and upper trapezius (UT) are commonly targeted in exercise programs to address prevention and treatment of poor scapular control (e. g., shoulder impingement, scapular winging). While modified push-ups are often {{used for this purpose}} due to their good SA/UT activation ratio, a better understanding of SA and UT activation during different upper-body exercises is needed. For example, the ability of common exercises such as suspended push-ups and <b>standing</b> cable <b>press</b> to activate the SA and UT is unknown. Furthermore, while sensory manipulation demonstrates enhanced muscle activation in other stabilizer muscles, there is no knowledge regarding this variation during suspended push-ups and its effect on SA and UT activation. PURPOSE: To compare muscle activation and activity ratios during standard push-ups on the floor, suspended push-ups with/without visual input, and <b>standing</b> cable <b>press</b> at 70 % 1 RM. METHODS: 29 physically fit and healthy male participants took part in a randomized, within-subject design assessment. The maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) was used to normalize data. Each participant performed three repetitions in all conditions using the same grip width, speed, and range of movement. Mean %MVIC values of the SA, UT, and ratios were compared using Analysis of Variance with a Bonferroni post-hoc analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between conditions for all muscles (p< 0. 001) (Table 1). CONCLUSIONS: Suspended push-ups are not an optimal exercise for those with shoulder impingement or scapular winging. Visual input manipulation does affect SA or UT muscle activity. These data provide an understanding of SA and UT activation during upper-body exercises...|$|R

60|$|As Mary {{advanced}} in years, she grew very beautiful. In {{some of the}} great processions and ceremonies, the ladies were accustomed to walk, magnificently dressed and carrying torches in their hands. In one of these processions Mary was moving along with the rest, through a crowd of spectators, and the light from her torch fell upon her features and upon her hair in such a manner as to make her appear more beautiful than usual. A woman, <b>standing</b> there, <b>pressed</b> up nearer to her to view her more closely, and, seeing how beautiful she was, asked her if she was not an angel. In those days, however, people believed in what is miraculous and supernatural more easily than now, so that it was not very surprising that one should think, in such a case, that an angel from Heaven had come down to join in the procession.|$|R
