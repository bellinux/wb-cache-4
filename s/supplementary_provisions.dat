This has enabled Eurostar rail services to travel at [...] for this part of their journey. A similar high-speed line in Belgium, from the French border to Brussels, HSL 1, opened in 1997. In Britain, Eurostar trains had to run at a maximum of [...] on existing tracks between London Waterloo and the Channel Tunnel. These tracks were shared with local traffic, {{limiting the number of}} services that could be run, and jeopardising reliability. The case for a high-speed line similar to the continental part of the route was recognised by policymakers, and the construction of the line was authorised by Parliament with the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996, which was amended by the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (<b>Supplementary</b> <b>Provisions)</b> Act 2008.|$|E

Designated artworks could be from any of the following categories: painting, sculpture, calligraphy, books, and handicrafts. Swords were added later. The law limited protection to items held at religious institutions, while articles in private ownership remained unprotected. Funds designated for the restoration of works of art and structures were increased from 20,000yen to 150,000yen, and fines were set for the destruction of cultural properties. Owners were required to register designated objects with newly created museums, which were granted first option of purchase in case of sale. Initially, 44 temple and shrine buildings and 155 relics were designated under the new law, including the kon-dō at Hōryū-ji.|$|E

2500|$|This {{first law}} was {{followed}} by a second law on December 15, 1897 giving <b>supplementary</b> <b>provisions</b> for designating works of art in the possession of temples or shrines as religious architecture could be designated as [...] The main criteria for designation were [...] "artistic superiority" [...] and [...] "value as historical evidence and wealth of historical associations", but also age was considered in the designation.

60|$|There was {{a lovely}} Sunday in particular, spent by him almost all in Balaklava Place--he arrived so early--when, in the afternoon, every sort of odd person dropped in. Miriam held a {{reception}} in the little garden and insisted on all the company's staying to supper. Her mother shed tears to Peter, in the desecrated house, because they had accepted, Miriam and she, an invitation--and in Cromwell Road too--for the evening. Miriam had now decreed they shouldn't go--they would have so much better fun with their good friends at home. She was sending off a message--it was a terrible distance--by a cabman, and Peter {{had the privilege of}} paying the messenger. Basil Dashwood, in another vehicle, proceeded to an hotel known to him, a mile away, for <b>supplementary</b> <b>provisions,</b> and came back with a cold ham and a dozen of champagne. It was all very Bohemian and dishevelled and delightful, very supposedly droll and enviable to outsiders; and Miriam told anecdotes and gave imitations of the people she would have met if she had gone out, so that no one had a sense of loss--the two occasions were fantastically united. Mrs. Rooth drank champagne for consolation, though the consolation was imperfect when she remembered she might have drunk it, though not quite so much perhaps, in Cromwell Road.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the additional <b>supplementary</b> pension <b>provision</b> through the Riester pension reform led to {{a fundamental change in}} the retirement provision system in Germany. Private providers accordingly assumed tasks which had up to then been incumbent on the statutory social security system. The reform defined a system break, which redefined the role of the private providers. Up to now the effect on the pension provision has thereby remained unexplained and worthy of discussion in research. The question is raised which consequences the {{introduction of}} the additional <b>supplementary</b> pension <b>provision</b> with products from private providers has on tangible pension provision in Germany. This survey deals with the publicly funded and consequently socially relevant methods of privately financed <b>supplementary</b> pension <b>provision</b> via the Riester pension provision as well as through company pension schemes. It analyses to what extent private providers meet the requirements of social security with their products. The survey design builds on quantifying providers, qualifying the application and the propagation of the <b>supplementary</b> pension <b>provision</b> and evaluating the offered products. The focus of the evaluation is the reconstruction of the actuarial pension annuity calculation. Since – according to the thesis adopted here – only the reconstruction of the product calculation can explain and determine the performance level of the pension annuity...|$|R

40|$|Demographic change {{confronts the}} German Pay-As-You-Go pension system with serious problems. For this reason, {{reductions}} {{in the level of}} public pensions were adopted under the pension reform in 2001, which also strengthened significantly the funded second and third pillars of old-age provision. The introduction of the <b>supplementary</b> pension <b>provision</b> brings with itself two major risks we are going to analyse in the present paper. One risk is implied by the voluntariness of supplementary arrangements. There is uncertainty over whether households � in particular the less affluent ones � will show the willingness and/or the capability to accumulate supplementary savings for their old age consistently. A further risk for <b>supplementary</b> old-age <b>provision</b> - which could as well be seen as a chance � rests in the return on contributions. Critics of funded private retirement provision often point at the return risk, in particular {{against the backdrop of the}} recent developments on capital markets. This paper asks whether under these risks, households will be able to close the gap arising from a reduction of public pension levels and to which degree there is scope for temporary suspensions of contributions to supplementary schemes. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Reference {{values are}} highly {{required}} parameters for all {{tests in the}} clinical laboratory, and the <b>supplementary</b> <b>provision</b> of reliable reference intervals is an important task for both clinical laboratories and diagnostic test manufacturers. Despite the progress {{that has been made}} in the conceptual aspects of reference intervals, in practice their use is still not completely satisfactory. Most of the laboratories have used various methods to calculate statistic-based reference intervals, and they have mainly focused on extracted data, yet its use is considerably limited. We {{had to deal with the}} inconvenience of using a number of programs (SPSS or SAS, MS Excel) in order to calculate the results of reference intervals. Methods: In order to obtain standardized reference intervals, we developed an integrated program that can calculate, by a nonparametric method, reference intervals with using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) processes as its guideline. We also developed a grouping interface that enables users to customize classification of each group (age, gender, blood group, race, etc) when calculating reference intervals. Results: To verify the developed program, we compared the reference intervals of the current data on 281 persons for 8 total areas, and the reference intervals were was already calculated beforehand with by using this new program. As a result, both results perfectly matched. Conclusions: This integrated program will be convenience for calculating reasonable values through continual datainspection at an inspection lab for calculating referenc...|$|R

40|$|Supplementary feeding {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{techniques}} used to alleviate threats to scavengers species related to the quality and availability of food resources. Because supplementary feeding may have undesired effects, the management of supplementary sites should be optimized from an ecological and conservation perspective. We installed high-resolution videocameras at six Spanish feeding stations recording more that 7500 h of observations at 105 feeding events. We analyzed food preferences in the four European vulture species (Eurasian griffon vulture Gyps fulvus, Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, bearded vulture Gypaetus barbatus and cinereous vulture Aegypius monachus) as they relate to the characteristics of the food remains and carcasses provided at feeding sites. Our results suggest that carrion features (format, scattering, prey species, biomass and items) influence differential selection between species and age-classes. At a species level, large inputs of unscattered carrion increased the abundance of actively feeding griffon vultures. The ratio of the abundance of bearded vultures, Egyptian vultures and cinereous vultures with respect to griffon vultures was favored when less biomass was supplied and when the food provided was not presented as whole carcasses. Thus, using medium-size ungulates (i. e. sheep and goats) presented as small, abundant and scattered pieces favors the consumption of the resource by the most endangered species. Our findings can be used to optimize the <b>supplementary</b> <b>provisioning</b> of vultures in cases where this conservation tool is considered essential for managing targeted species or population groups...|$|R
