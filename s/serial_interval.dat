SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: In addition to alloantigen-dependent events, antigen-independent factors can influence chronic rejection of organ allografts. Initial injury, including early ischemia and acute rejection, may contribute. METHODS: Kidney isografts were transplanted orthotopically into bilaterally nephrectomized rat recipients and studied functionally, morphologically and immunohistologically, at <b>serial</b> <b>intervals</b> up to 72 weeks after transplantation. Controls included chronically rejecting kidney allografts using a well-established model, non-nephrectomized and uninephrectomized animals with a native kidney that had undergone initial ischemia and uninephrectomized rats whose remaining kidney had been manipulated operatively. RESULTS: Allograft recipients developed progressive proteinuria after 12 weeks, with gradual renal failure ultimately leading to death. At the same time, morphologic changes, including progressive arteriosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis, developed. Immunohistologically, macrophages infiltrated glomeruli during this period and cytokines became upregulated. Comparable changes occurred in isografts, but later, beginning after week 24 and progressing thereafter. The single ischemic kidney in uninephrectomized controls also developed the same lesions; no comparable changes were noted in other control kidneys. CONCLUSIONS: Antigen-independent functional and morphologic changes occur in long-term kidney isografts that resemble those appearing considerably earlier in allografts that reject chronically. Initial injury and extent of functioning renal mass may be important factors for such late changes...|$|R

DESIGN: Enhanced surveillance of norovirus outbreaks between November 2009 and November 2011. METHODS: Data were gathered during 149 outbreaks of norovirus in hospital wards from five hospitals in two major cities in England serving a population of two million. We used the time between the first two cases of each outbreak to estimate the <b>serial</b> <b>interval</b> for norovirus in this setting. This distribution and dates of illness onset were used to calculate epidemic trees for each outbreak. We then used a permutation test to assess whether proximity, for all outbreaks, was more extreme than would be expected by chance under the null hypothesis that proximity {{was not associated with}} transmission risk. RESULTS: 65 outbreaks contained complete data on both onset dates and ward position. We estimated the <b>serial</b> <b>interval</b> to be 1. 86 days (95 % CI 1. 6 to 2. 2 days), and with this value found strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that proximity was not significant (p< 0. 001).

Recent theoretical work has focused on making best use of data from the initial exponential phase of growth of incidence in large populations. We measured generational transmissibility by the basic reproductive number R 0 and the <b>serial</b> <b>interval</b> by its mean Tg. First, we constructed a simulation algorithm for case data arising from a small population of known size with R 0 and Tg also known. We then developed an inferential model for the likelihood of these case data {{as a function of}} R 0 and Tg. The model was designed to capture a) any signal of the <b>serial</b> <b>interval</b> distribution in the initial stochastic phase b) the growth rate of the exponential phase and c) the unique combination of R 0 and Tg that generates a specific shape of peak incidence when the susceptible portion of a small population is depleted. Extensive repeat simulation and parameter estimation revealed no bias in univariate estimates of either R 0 and Tg. We were also able to simultaneously estimate both R 0 and Tg. However, accurate final estimates could be obtained only much later in the outbreak. In particular, estimates of Tg were considerably less accurate in the bivariate case until the peak of incidence had passed. The basic reproductive number and mean <b>serial</b> <b>interval</b> can be estimated simultaneously in real time during an outbreak of an emerging pathogen.

Appropriate public health responses to this pandemic depend in part on early estimates of key epidemiological parameters of the virus in defined populations. Methods: We use a likelihood-based method to estimate the basic reproductive number (R 0) and <b>serial</b> <b>interval</b> using individual level U. S. data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We adjust for missing dates of illness and changes in case ascertainment. Using prior estimates for the <b>serial</b> <b>interval</b> we also estimate the reproductive number only. Results: Using the raw CDC data, we estimate the reproductive number to be between 2 · 2 and 2 · 3 and the mean of the <b>serial</b> <b>interval</b> (μ) between 2 · 5 and 2 · 6 days. After adjustment for increased case ascertainment our estimates change to 1 · 7 to 1 · 8 for R 0 and 2 · 2 to 2 · 3 days for μ. In a sensitivity analysis making use of previous estimates of the mean of the <b>serial</b> <b>interval,</b> both for this epidemic (μ = 1 · 91 days) and for seasonal influenza (μ = 3 · 6 days), we estimate the reproductive number at 1 · 5 to 3 · 1. Conclusions: With adjustments for data imperfections we obtain useful estimates of key epidemiological parameters for the current influenza H 1 N 1 outbreak in the United States. Estimates that adjust for suspected increases in reporting suggest that substantial reductions in the spread of this epidemic may be achievable with aggressive control measures, while sensitivity analyses suggest the possibility that even such measures would have limited effect in reducing total attack rates. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{determinant of}} a pathogen’s {{success is the}} rate at which it is transmitted from infected to susceptible hosts. Although there are anecdotal reports that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones vary in their transmissibility in hospital settings, attempts to quantify such variation are lacking for common subtypes, as are methods for addressing this question using routinely-collected MRSA screening data in endemic settings. Here we present a method to quantify the time-varying transmissibility of different subtypes of common bacterial nosocomial pathogens using routine surveillance data. The method adapts approaches for estimating reproduction numbers based on the probabilistic reconstruction of epidemic trees, but uses relative hazards rather than <b>serial</b> <b>intervals</b> to assign probabilities to different sources for observed transmission events. The method is applied to data collected as part of a retrospective observational study of a concurrent MRSA outbreak in the United Kingdom with dominant endemic MRSA clones (ST 22 and ST 36) and an Asian ST 239 MRSA strain (ST 239 -TW) in two linked adult intensive care units, and compared with an approach based on a fully parametric transmission model. The results provide support for the hypothesis that the clones responded differently to an infection control measure based on the use of topical antiseptics, which was more effective at reducing transmission of endemic clones. They also suggest that in one of the two ICUs patients colonized or infected with the ST 239 -TW MRS...|$|R

BackgroundGlomerular macrophage accumulation in diabetes implicates monocyte recruitment mechanisms in {{the pathogenesis of}} diabetic nephropathy. To test the hypothesis that overexpression of monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1), a monocyte chemoattractant, is attenuated by renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition, we assessed expression of genes regulating monocyte transmigration in the glomeruli of diabetic rats. MethodsCompetitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to semiquantitate mRNA expression in glomeruli harvested by sieving at <b>serial</b> <b>intervals</b> after the induction of diabetes by streptozotocin in Munich-Wistar rats. Although subject to limitations, competitive RT-PCR provides an objective measure suited to the minute quantities of RNA extractable from glomerular isolates. ResultsTime-dependent elevation of MCP- 1 expression was dramatically suppressed by treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril or the AT 1 receptor antagonist candesartan, and was closely associated with effects on proteinuria and glomerular macrophage number. By contrast, no sustained suppression of the cell adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 or vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 or the classic MCP- 1 stimulators tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin- 1 β followed RAS inhibition, and suppression of transforming growth factor-β 1 expression was transient. ConclusionThese data suggest that glomerular macrophage recruitment in experimental diabetes is largely determined by angiotensin-stimulated MCP- 1 expression. We conclude that the RAS is an important regulator of local MCP- 1 expression, either directly or through glomerular hemodynamic effects, and that our data strongly implicate macrophage recruitment and activation in the pathogenesis of early diabetic glomerular injury...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Although the {{generation}} time of an infectious disease {{plays a key}} role in estimating its transmission potential, the impact of the sampling time of generation times on the estimation procedure has yet to be clarified. The present study defines the period and cohort generation times, both of which are time-inhomogeneous, as a function of the infection time of secondary and pri-mary cases, respectively. By means of analytical and numerical approaches, it is shown that the period generation time increases with calendar time, whereas the cohort generation time decreases as the incidence increases. The initial growth phase of an epidemic of Asian influenza A (H 2 N 2) in the Netherlands in 1957 was reanalyzed, and estimates of the basic reproduction number, R 0, from the Lotka-Euler equation were examined. It was found that the sam-pling time of generation time during the course of the epidemic introduced a time-effect to the estimate of R 0. Other historical data of a primary pneu-monic plague in Manchuria in 1911 were also examined to help illustrate the empirical evidence of the period generation time. If the <b>serial</b> <b>intervals,</b> which eventually determine {{the generation}} times, are sampled during the course of an epidemic, direct application of the sampled generation-time distribution to the Lotka-Euler equation leads to a biased estimate of R 0. An appropriate quan-tification of the transmission potential requires the estimation of the cohort generation time during the initial growth phase of an epidemic or adjustment of the time-effect (e. g., adjustment of the growth rate of the epidemic during the sampling time) on the period generation time. A similar issue also applies to the estimation of the effective reproduction number as a function of cal-endar time.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Mathematical {{modelling}} of Clostridium difficile infection dynamics {{could contribute}} to the optimisation of strategies for its prevention and control. The objective of this systematic review was to summarise the available literature specifically identifying the quantitative parameters required for a compartmental mathematical model of Clostridium difficile transmission. METHODS: Six electronic healthcare databases were searched and all screening, data extraction and study quality assessments were undertaken in duplicate. Results were synthesised using a narrative approach. RESULTS: Fifty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. Reproduction numbers for hospital based epidemics were described in two studies with a range from 0. 55 to 7. Two studies provided consistent data on incubation periods. For 62 % of cases, symptoms occurred in less than 4 weeks (3 - 28 days) after infection. Evidence on contact patterns was identified in four studies but with limited data reported for populating a mathematical model. Two studies, including one without clinically apparent donor-recipient pairs, provided information on <b>serial</b> <b>intervals</b> for household or ward contacts, showing transmission intervals of < 1 week in ward based contacts compared to up to 2 months for household contacts. Eight studies reported recovery rates of between 75 %- 100 % for patients who had been treated with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Forty-nine studies gave recurrence rates of between 3 % and 49 % but were limited by varying definitions of recurrence. No study was found which specifically reported force of infection or net reproduction numbers. CONCLUSIONS: There is currently scant literature overtly citing estimates of the parameters required to inform the quantitative modelling of Clostridium difficile transmission. Further high quality studies to investigate transmission parameters are required, including through review of published epidemiological studies where these quantitative estimates {{may not have been}} explicitly estimated, but that nonetheless contain the relevant data to allow their calculation...|$|R

It has the same worst case delay as the <b>serial</b> <b>interval</b> multiplier, yet requires only one or three cycles to compute the interval product. Compared to previous hardware interval multipliers, our designs are one to three times faster and require less area...|$|E

This paper reanalyzes the temporal distribution of pandemic influenza in Prussia, Germany, from 1918 – 19 using the daily numbers of deaths, which totaled 8911 from 29 September 1918 to 1 February 1919, {{and the distribution of}} the time delay from onset to death in order to estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case at a given time. Results A discrete-time branching process was applied to back-calculated incidence data, assuming three different serial intervals (i. e. 1, 3 and 5 days). The estimated reproduction numbers exhibited a clear association between the estimates and choice of serial interval; i. e. the longer the assumed <b>serial</b> <b>interval,</b> the higher the reproduction number. Moreover, the estimated reproduction numbers did not decline monotonically with time, indicating that the patterns of secondary transmission varied with time. These tendencies are consistent with the differences in estimates of the reproduction number of pandemic influenza in recent studies; high estimates probably originate from a long <b>serial</b> <b>interval</b> and a model assumption about transmission rate that takes no account of time variation and is applied to the entire epidemic curve. Conclusion The present findings suggest that in order to offer robust assessments it is critically important to clarify in detail the natural history of a disease (e. g. including the <b>serial</b> <b>interval)</b> as well as heterogeneous patterns of transmission. In addition, given that human contact behavior probably influences transmissibility, individual countermeasures (e. g. household quarantine and mask-wearing) need to be explored to construct effective non-pharmaceutical interventions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{estimate}} the transmissibility of the Ice Bucket Challenge among globally influential celebrities {{and to identify}} associated risk factors. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Social media (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). Participants David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, Benedict Cumberbatch, Stephen Hawking, Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah Winfrey, Homer Simpson, and Kermit the Frog were defined as index cases. We included contacts up to the fifth generation seeded from each index case and enrolled a total of 99 participants into the cohort. Main outcome measures Basic reproduction number R 0, <b>serial</b> <b>interval</b> of accepting the challenge, and odds ratios of associated risk factors based on fully observed nomination chains; R 0 {{is a measure of}} transmissibility and is defined as the number of secondary cases generated by a single index in a fully susceptible population. <b>Serial</b> <b>interval</b> is the duration between onset of a primary case and onset of its secondary cases. Results Based on the empirical data and assuming a branching process we estimated a mean R 0 of 1. 43 (95 % confidence interval 1. 23 to 1. 65) and a mean <b>serial</b> <b>interval</b> for accepting the challenge of 2. 1 days (median 1 day). Higher log (base 10) net worth of the participants was positively associated with transmission (odds ratio 1. 63, 95 % confidence interval 1. 06 to 2. 50), adjusting for age and sex. Conclusions The Ice Bucket Challenge was moderately transmissible among a group of globally influential celebrities, in the range of the pandemic A/H 1 N 1 2009 influenza. The challenge was more likely to be spread by richer celebrities, perhaps in part reflecting greater social influence...|$|E
