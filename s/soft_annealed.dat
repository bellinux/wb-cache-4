40|$|Abstract. Pearlite {{spheroidisation}} of 100 CrMn 6 steel was investigated. This {{process is}} well known and studied during conventional <b>soft</b> <b>annealing.</b> Presented paper describes cementite lamellae fragmentation during accelerated carbide spheroidisation. Mechanism of cementite lamellae fragmentation during conventional <b>soft</b> <b>annealing</b> depends on carbon and iron diffusion in ferrite-cementite system. On the other hand, accelerated carbide spheroidisation relies on partial pearlite austenitization and backward austenite decomposition. Aim of presented experiments was to examine shape evolution of cementite particles during transition from lamellar to globular form. Pearlite spheroidisation is normally quantified by image analysis of 2 D metallographic section. Conventional metallographic observation was used for globular-lamellar particle ratio estimation. However, whole lamellae observation is necessary for spheroidisation process revelation. Ferrite matrix deep etching and cementite separation was performed to study morphological aspects of acceolerated carbide spheroidisation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the concept of ECAP applied to a {{commercial}} Al Mg-Si alloy (AA 6082. 50). A detailed analysis of the strains introduced by ECAP in a single passage through the die has been made, based on direct measurements on partially pressed samples. Further, the mechanical properties of ECAP’ed samples have been investigated. The effect of initial material temper and post-ECAP artificial aging was investigated in addition to the effect of strain accumulation and processing route. Finally, a detailed study of the textural and microstructural development was made. The continuous evolution of texture and microstructure was followed through the ECAP deformation zone up to an accumulated strain of 2 (2 passes) by route A, and linked to strain measurements from the same zone. Strain measurements on sectioned samples have validated the plane strain assumption for ECAP. The shear angle has been measured and some typical features of ECAP have been corroborated, i. e. friction and material temper affect the strain distribution, the strain homogeneity and the workpiece corner angle, friction being the most significant here. Also, new conclusions have been drawn. The analysis of material element deformation histories along path lines reveals that ECAP can be interpreted as the combination of shearing and stretching (i. e. tension and/or compression). Furthermore, the final shear strain angle obtained in ECAP appears to be friction and material temper independent in the zone of homogeneous deformation. The 6082 alloy has been successfully processed by ECAP at room temperature to strains ε = 6 to ε = 8. The alloy has been pressed in the solutionized, T 4, homogenized and <b>soft</b> <b>annealed</b> states. The highest tensile strength was obtained from the solutionized material, followed by T 4, homogenized and <b>soft</b> <b>annealed.</b> This behaviour is linked to the solid solution content prior to ECAP and the potential for dynamic precipitation during ECAP processing. The tensile elongation to failure drops to a constant level between 4 % and 9 % after ECAP and is highest for the <b>soft</b> <b>annealed</b> and lowest for the solutionized material. The ductility in the solutionized material can, however, recover to ~ 18 % elongation to failure (i. e. an increase by a factor 2 - 3) by low temperature heat treatment with only a small drop in tensile strength. <b>Soft</b> <b>annealed</b> and ECAP’ed material has been compared to cold rolling to similar strains. The tensile strength response to accumulated strain is similar, but the ductility and post uniform deformation is different. However, the ECAP’ed material can be processed to higher strains and, thus, achieving higher strength. The tensile yield strength behaviour of the homogenized and ECAP’ed material can be described by a simple relation to the grain size and the fraction high and low angle boundaries. The typical texture components related to ECAP of aluminium, pressed by route A, have been identified. The typical ECAP texture starts to develop already at ~ 25 % strain and increases in intensity during the first pass. In the second pass, two of the stable texture components continue to increase in intensity, while the other texture components decrease. The microstructural development during the first pass is dominated by deformation banding leading to grain-subdivision. The average linear intercept distance (grain size) is reduced from ~ 80 μm to ~ 4 μm for high angle boundaries and from ~ 10 μm to ~ 0. 7 μm for low angle boundaries. During the second pass, the linear intercept distance is further reduced to ~ 1. 8 μm for high angle and ~ 0. 3 μm for low angle boundaries. Deformation twins are observed during the second pass and are believed {{to play an important role}} in severe plastic deformation when the grains reach the sub-micron or nano-metre scale. The deformation banding have been explained in terms of the low energy dislocation structure (LEDS) theory, and has been shown to be an important mechanism in the early stages of grain subdivision, and is further believed to be the main source of high angle grain boundary formation by grain subdivision down to a grain size of approximately ~ 0 6 μm, when other deformation mechanisms may be energetically more favourable. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to record heating curves between 20 and 600  °C. Heating rates were studied from 0. 01  K/s to 5  K/s. We paid particular attention to control baseline stability, generating flat baselines and allowing accurate quantitative evaluation of the resulting DSC curves. As the heating rate increases, the individual dissolution and precipitation reactions shift to higher temperatures. The reactions during heating are significantly superimposed and partially run simultaneously. In addition, precipitation and dissolution reactions are increasingly suppressed as the heating rate increases, whereby exothermic precipitation reactions are suppressed earlier than endothermic dissolution reactions. Integrating the heating curves allowed the enthalpy levels of the different initial microstructural conditions to be quantified.

First results indicate efficient photoactivity under UV and visible irradiation...|$|R
