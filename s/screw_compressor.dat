It is therefore of interest to present the authors? recent experiences and share the acquired knowledge by comparing features with reciprocating compressors and/or centrifugal compressors. High reliability, low maintenance costs, simple foundations, low operational costs, low initial consts, low consumed power at unloaded condition, and suitability for process fluctuation such as gas composition and pressure are some of the basic attributes of the rotary <b>screw</b> <b>compressors.</b> These attributes have resulted in a significant demand for such machine, primarily as an alternate to reciprocating compressors...|$|R

50|$|Economizer screw {{compressors}} {{are being built}} by several manufacturers like Refcomp, Mycom, Bitzer and York. These machines merge both compressors of a two staged system into one <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> and have two inputs: the main suction and an interstage side entrance for higher pressure gas. This means {{there is no need}} to install two compressors and still benefit from the booster concept.|$|E
50|$|The Roots-type blower may {{achieve an}} {{efficiency}} of around 70% while achieving a maximum pressure ratio of two. Because a Roots type blower pumps air in discrete pulses (unlike a <b>screw</b> <b>compressor),</b> pulsation noise and turbulence may be transmitted downstream. If not properly managed (through outlet piping geometry) or accounted for (by structural reinforcement of downstream components), the resulting pulsations can cause fluid cavitation and/or damage to components downstream of the blower.|$|E
50|$|Oil-free {{compressors}} {{are used}} in applications where entrained oil carry-over is not acceptable, such as medical research and semiconductor manufacturing. However, this does not preclude the need for filtration, as hydrocarbons and other contaminants ingested from the ambient air must also be removed prior {{to the point of}} use. Subsequently, air treatment identical to that used for an oil-flooded <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> is frequently still required to ensure a given quality of compressed air.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to Roots blowers, <b>screw</b> <b>compressors</b> {{are made with}} different profiles on the two rotors: the male rotor has convex lobes which mesh with the concave cavities of the female rotor. Usually the male rotor has fewer lobes than the female rotor, so that it rotates faster. Originally, <b>screw</b> <b>compressors</b> were made with symmetrical rotor cavity profiles, but modern versions use asymmetrical rotors, with the exact rotor designs being the subject of patents.|$|R

Nowadays the spool efficiency controlled oil-flooded <b>screw</b> <b>compressors</b> are widely used for the fuel gas supply into the gas turbine unit (GTU). This paper presents the existing types of the spool configurations whereby the <b>screw</b> <b>compressors</b> control is realized as well as the new spool design construction that allows to implement the gas bypass from the higher pressure paired chamber to the low pressure one is offered.

50|$|The rotary <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> has low leakage {{levels and}} low {{parasitic}} losses vs. Roots type. The supercharger is typically driven {{directly from the}} engine's crankshaft via a belt or gear drive. Unlike the Roots type supercharger, the twin-screw exhibits internal compression which {{is the ability of}} the device to compress air within the housing as it is moved through the device instead of relying upon resistance to flow downstream of the discharge to establish an increase of pressure.|$|E
50|$|An Air Start Unit is {{a device}} used {{to start the}} aircraft's engines when the aircraft's APU is not operational. There are three primary types of these devices that exist currently: a stored air cart, a gas turbine based unit, and a diesel engine driven <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> unit. All three devices create a source of high {{pressure}} air to start the aircraft engines. Typically one or two hoses are connect to these units, with the largest aircraft engines requiring three.|$|E
50|$|Most {{compressors}} {{are either}} positive displacement compressors or radial compressors. Positive displacement compressors are currently {{the most efficient}} type of compressor, and have the largest refrigerating effect per single unit (400-2500 RT). They have a large range of possible power supplies, and can be 380 V, 1000 V, or even higher. The principle behind positive displacement compressors utilizes a turbine to compress refrigerant into high-pressure vapor. Positive displacement compressors are of four main types: <b>screw</b> <b>compressor,</b> rolling piston compressor, reciprocating compressor, and rotary compressor.|$|E

40|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>compressors</b> {{are complex}} flow systems, but operate upon simple considerations: they are {{positive}} displacement machines consisting of meshing rotors {{contained in a}} casing to form a working chamber, whose volume depends only on the angle of rotation. Although the basic operation of twin <b>screw</b> <b>compressors</b> is well understood and the analytical methods for performance prediction are well established, the CFD analysis of such machines {{is still in its}} early days and requires more research in order to mature to the level of standardised application, {{as is the case with}} most turbomachinery applications. The performance of <b>screw</b> <b>compressors</b> is highly affected by leakages, which are dependent on various clearances and the pressure differences across these clearances. The numerical simulation of the leakage flows is the challenging aspect of running CFD in <b>screw</b> <b>compressors,</b> as the flow domain reduces in tip areas to the order of several microns. Commercial grid generators struggle in reproducing the flow path with good quality elements and user defined meshing techniques are currently available to allow the remeshing of the rotors domain to capture the modified aspect of the compression chamber at the start of each time step. This technique allows the full compressor performance prediction by means of CFD but does not allow for local mesh refinement in the tip area, where the turbulent character of the flow requires adequate boundary layer considerations. This is the area of concern in the present paper, where several means of investigating the flow in the very tight tip clearance area are proposed: 1) a three-dimensional model of all interacting compression chambers to investigate the effects of employing mesh-deforming techniques for the compressor simulation; 2) a simplified two-dimensional leakage model to identify the mesh refinement requirements for appropriate turbulence modelling.

50|$|Utilized by {{compressor}} companies Quincy Compressor, Kobelco, Gardner Denver, and Sullair, {{variable displacement}} alters {{the percentage of}} the <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> rotors working to compress air by allowing air flow to bypass portions of the screws. While this does reduce power consumption when compared to a modulation control scheme, a load/unload system can be more effective with large amounts of storage (10 gallons per CFM). If a large amount of storage is not practical, a variable-displacement system can be very effective, especially at greater than 70% of full load.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{economizer}} setups for these compressors, flash and subcooling. The latter works under the same principle as the two staged booster displays with subcooling. The flash economizer is different because it doesn’t use a heat exchanger to produce the subcooling. Instead, it has a flash chamber or tank, in which flash gas is produced to lower the temperature of the liquid before the expansion. The flash gas that is produced in this tank leaves the liquid line and goes to the economizer entrance of the <b>screw</b> <b>compressor.</b>|$|E

The dynamic and regenerative braking system operates under all three NJT electrical systems. In addition, the locomotive, while in diesel mode, is capable of routing power generated by the electric brake to HEP and locomotive auxiliary power requirements {{in addition to the}} dynamic brake resistor.|$|E

However, <b>screw</b> <b>compressors</b> are positive displacement machines with a working principle similar to reciprocating <b>compressors,</b> which gives <b>screws</b> some advantages compared to centrifugals, such as: The suction volume flow and power consumption grow linearly with the compressor speed, at a constant discharge pressure; The suction volume flow is nearly constant for variation of pressure ratio or gas molecular weight with no surging limit; The achievable pressure ratio per compressor stage does not depend on the gas molecular weight but is limited mostly by the allowable discharge temperature or by mechanical limits; By using liquid injection for cooling, pressure ratios up to 10 and in some cases higher are possible in one compressor stage. The largest dry <b>screw</b> <b>compressors</b> built up to now have a suction volume flow of 45, 300 acfm (77, 000 m 3 /h). Driver power may reach 9 MW.

The silencer design consisted of resonators combined with acoustic absorption material. The paper describes some general aspects of pulsations in <b>screw</b> <b>compressors.</b> A field case is used to demonstrate different design evaluations such as one- and three-dimensional acoustic modeling, fluid-structure interaction, mechanical response, testing of absorption material and scale-model testing.

5000|$|On March 24, 1878 Heinrich Krigar of Germany {{obtained}} patent #4121, patenting {{the first}} ever screw-type compressor.

His designs show a two-lobe rotor assembly with each rotor having the same shape as the other.

Unfortunately, the technology of the time was not sufficient to produce such a unit, and Heinrich made no further progress with the <b>screw</b> <b>compressor.</b> Nearly half a century later, in 1935, Alf Lysholm, who was working for Ljungstroms Angturbin AB (later known as Svenska Rotor Maskiner AB or SRM in 1951), patented a design with five female and four male rotors. He also patented the method for machining the compressor rotors.|$|E
