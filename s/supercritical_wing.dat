5|$|The Boeing 757 is a mid-size, narrow-body {{twin-engine}} jet airliner {{that was}} designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft and was produced from 1981 to 2004. The twinjet has a two-crew member glass cockpit, turbofan engines of sufficient power to allow takeoffs from relatively short runways and higher altitudes, a conventional tail and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a <b>supercritical</b> <b>wing</b> design. Intended to replace the smaller three-engine 727 on short and medium routes, the 757 can carry 200 to 295 passengers for a maximum of , depending on variant. The 757 was designed concurrently with a wide-body twinjet, the 767, and owing to shared features pilots can obtain a common type rating {{that allows them to}} operate both aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 767 is a mid- to large-size, mid- to long-range, {{wide-body}} twin-engine jet airliner {{built by}} Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was Boeing's first wide-body twinjet and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has two turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a <b>supercritical</b> <b>wing</b> design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft {{such as the}} 747, the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 people, and a design range of , depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow-body twinjet, the 757, resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Different sources {{claim the}} ARJ21 closely resembles either the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 or the MD-90 which were license-produced in China. Chinese {{factories}} producing parts for the MD-90 {{went on to}} produce the ARJ21 using tooling retained {{after the end of}} the MD-80/MD-90 licensed production program.. China claims that the ARJ21 is a completely indigenous design in spite of the fact that production drawings seen for the fuselage during development were simply McDonnell Douglas drawings with the identifying legend overlaid with a Chinese legend. The ARJ21's development did depend heavily on foreign suppliers, including engines and avionics from the United States. The ARJ21 features an all-new <b>supercritical</b> <b>wing</b> having a sweepback of 25degrees and designed by Ukraine’s Antonov Design Bureau. It is fitted with winglets to improve aerodynamic performance. Antonov also assisted the project with geometrical determination and integral analysis of the construction strength of ARJ21. Some of China's supercomputers have been used to design parts for ARJ21.|$|E

40|$|Work {{done under}} the Energy Efficient Transport {{project in the}} field of {{advanced}} aerodynamics and active controls is summarized. The project task selections focused on the following: the investigation of long-duct nacelle shape variation on interference drag; the investigation of the adequacy of a simple control law for the elastic modes of a wing; the development of the aerodynamic technology at cruise and low speed of high-aspect-ratio <b>supercritical</b> <b>wings</b> of high performance; and the development of winglets for a second-generation jet transport. All the tasks involved analysis and substantial wind tunnel testing. The winglet program also included flight evaluation. It is considered that the technology base has been built for the application of high-aspect-ratio <b>supercritical</b> <b>wings</b> and for the use of winglets on second-generation transports...|$|R
25|$|The 328 is {{furnished}} {{with the same}} <b>supercritical</b> <b>wing</b> design that had been originally developed from Dornier's earlier Do 228, this wing provides the aircraft with both excellent cruise and climb capabilities. The straightforward construction techniques of the Do 228 were also reproduced for the 328, despite making increased use of composite materials {{in areas such as}} the rear fuselage and empennage. The 328 reportedly made greater use of composites than any of its direct competitors at launch, the use of the Kevlar-carbon fiber composites is claimed to have reduced its weight by 20 per cent. Various materials are used across the airframe; amongst these, an aluminium alloy is used for the pressure fuselage and much of the wingbox, a titanium alloy for the tail cone, and glass fibre reinforced plastic for the radome and leading edge of the vertical stabilizer. Noise-absorbent material is located across the fuselage, while the cabin wall is hung from isolator brackets to reduce vibration and noise transference.|$|E
500|$|The {{technological}} advances {{incorporated into the}} Harrier II, compared with the original Harrier, significantly reduce the workload on the pilot. The <b>supercritical</b> <b>wing,</b> hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) control principle, and increased engineered [...] stability make the aircraft fundamentally easier to fly. Ed Harper, general manager for the McDonnell Douglas Harrier II development program, summarized: [...] "The AV-8B {{looks a lot like}} the original Harrier and it uses the same operating fundamentals. It just uses them a lot better". A large cathode-ray tube multi-purpose display, taken from the F/A-18, makes up much of the instrument panel in the cockpit. It has a wide range of functions, including radar warning information and weapon delivery checklist. The pilots sit on UPC/Stencel 10B zero-zero ejection seats, meaning that they are able to eject from a stationary aircraft at zero altitude.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{thorough}} redesign {{was of the}} wing, the objective being to match {{the performance of the}} cancelled AV-16 while retaining the Pegasus engine of the AV-8A. Engineers designed a new, one-piece <b>supercritical</b> <b>wing,</b> which improves cruise performance by delaying the rise in drag and increasing lift-to-drag ratio. Made of composites, the wing is thicker and has a longer span than that of the AV-8A. Compared to the AV-8A's wing, it has a higher aspect ratio, reduced sweep (from 40° to 37°), and an area increased from [...] to [...] The wing has a high-lift configuration, employing flaps that deploy automatically when maneuvering, and drooped ailerons. Using the leading edge root extensions, the new wing allows for a 6,700lb (3,035kg) increase in payload compared with the first-generation Harriers after a 1,000ft (300m) takeoff roll. Because the wing is almost exclusively composite, it is [...] lighter than the AV-8A's smaller wing.|$|E

2500|$|While the Challenger {{would be}} similar in general {{configuration}} to other aircraft of its type already on the market, certain of its features would stand out, for example, {{the use of a}} widened fuselage that allowed a [...] "walk-about cabin".

2500|$|By 1973, North American had {{merged with}} Rockwell Standard {{under the name}} Rockwell International. In 1976 Rockwell {{contracted}} Raisbeck Engineering to redesign the wing of the Sabreliner series. The resulting Raisbeck Mark V wing was the first <b>supercritical</b> <b>wing</b> in service in the United States. [...] The Mark V wing was combined with Garrett AiResearch TFE731 turbofan engines, to create the Series 65. Sabreliner models 60 and 80 were retrofitted with the Mark V wing as the Series 60A (STC SA687NW) and Series 80A (STC SA847NW).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to improved transonic performance, a supercritical wing's enlarged leading edge gives it excellent high-lift characteristics. Consequently, aircraft utilizing a <b>supercritical</b> <b>wing</b> have superior takeoff and landing performance. This makes the <b>supercritical</b> <b>wing</b> a favorite for designers of cargo transport aircraft. A notable {{example of one}} such heavy-lift aircraft that uses a <b>supercritical</b> <b>wing</b> is the C-17 Globemaster III.|$|E

40|$|Pressure {{data from}} a number of {{previous}} wind tunnel and flight investigations of high speed transport type wings were analyzed with the intent of developing a procedure for extrapolating low Reynolds number data to flight conditions. These analyses produced a correlation of the development of trailing-edge separation resulting from increases in Mach number and/or angle of attack and show that scale effects on this correlated separation development and the resulting shock location changes fall into a regular and apparently universal pattern. Further studies appear warranted to refine the correlation through a detailed consideration of boundary layer characteristics, and to evaluate scale effects on <b>supercritical</b> <b>wings...</b>|$|R
