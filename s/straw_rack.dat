40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} four preventive measures and two curative treatments of tail biting. The preventive measures were: chain, rubber hose, <b>straw</b> <b>rack</b> (5 g/pig/day) and the provision of straw on the floor twice daily by hand (2 × 10 g/pig/day). The two curative treatments, which were applied following the onset of tail biting in a pen were: straw twice daily (as in the fourth preventive measure) and the removal of the biter. In total, 960 undocked weaned piglets (10 piglets per pen) were observed during 5 weeks. Tail lesions (none, bite marks and wounds) were recorded daily. The incidence of pens with wounded pig tails was significantly lower when straw was provided twice daily (8 % of pens) compared to the chain (58 % of pens) and rubber hose (54 % of pens) treatment, but did not differ significantly from the <b>straw</b> <b>rack</b> treatment (29 % of pens). Tails with bite marks were significantly less common in pens with twice daily straw (16 % of pens) compared to chain (88 % of pens), rubber hose (79 % of pens) and <b>straw</b> <b>rack</b> (75 % of pens). No significant difference was found between the curative treatments. Both treatments showed a reduced incidence of red fresh blood on the tails at days 1 ¿ 9 following curative treatment, compared to day 0. However, neither curative treatment eliminated tail biting entirely. In conclusion, this study indicates that tail biting is best prevented {{with a small amount of}} straw, provided twice daily, and to a lesser extent with a <b>straw</b> <b>rack,</b> compared to providing a chain or a rubber hose. Once tail biting has occurred, providing a small amount of straw twice daily and removing the biter appears to be equally effective...|$|E
40|$|Pigs {{are often}} housed in barren {{intensive}} housing systems {{but according to}} council directive 2008 / 120 /EC, they must have access to enrichment materials. In order to be successful, enrichment should be destructible, edible, nutritional and dung-free. Straw {{seems to be an}} interesting enrichment material but is not a practical option for fully-slatted systems. Producers must therefore provide straw applications to reduce straw waste through the slatted floor. Both the type of straw used and the design of the application might influence the interest for and the effectiveness of the materials. It is therefore designated to verify differences in ways to present enrichment materials, in order to detect applications which are less interesting for pigs. To this end, four straw applications were tested simultaneously (1 enrichment application per pen) during 4 cohorts, presenting them each time during two weeks to 6 pigs (total n = 96) in pens with slatted floors. The four applications tested were a <b>straw</b> <b>rack</b> (long-stemmed straw), a straw feeder (long-stemmed straw), a MIK Toy (in rolls pressed chopped straw) and the Ikadan Straw Dispenser with chopped straw. All pigs had ad libitum access to straw from one of the applications. Behaviour was recorded using video cameras. Data were analysed per individual pig for week 1 and week 2 separately using the logistic mixed model. The daily used straw quantity per pen was registered during the entire test period. The quantity of straw use was the highest in presence of the <b>straw</b> <b>rack</b> (P < 0. 0001), with an average straw use of approximately 2 kg per pen (6 pigs) per week. Straw use did not differ between week 1 and week 2 for any of the applications, but manipulative behaviour towards the application decreased for all applications during week 2 compared to week 1. This suggests a decrease in the required time to intake straw from the applications. In presence of the straw feeder, most of the time only one pig was occupied with the application, while in presence of the <b>straw</b> <b>rack,</b> the MIK Toy and the Funbar, more pigs interacted simultaneously with the device (P < 0. 0001). Pigs spent more consecutive scans interacting with the <b>straw</b> <b>rack</b> and the straw feeder (P = 0. 0003), which could be explained by the use of long straw with these applications. The results show that the duration of interactions with the applications might depend on the type of straw that is used.

40|$|Chewing and rooting {{are high}} {{behavioural}} priorities in pigs. Lack of suitable materials {{can lead to}} abnormal behaviours such as tail and ear biting.

The {{aim of this study}} was to test three low-cost objects: branching metal chains, polythene pipe crosses and fresh wood. The study was carried out on undocked growing-finishing pigs on a commercial farm in Finland, housed on partly slatted floors in 10 -m 2 pens of 11 pigs.

40|$|The {{short-term}} {{effects of}} four straw applications on pigs housed on slatted floors were investigated to determine differences in behavior, straw use and growth. Both {{the type of}} straw used and {{the design of the}} application might influence the attractiveness and effectiveness of the applications. To this end, four straw applications were tested simultaneously (1 application per pen), presenting them during two weeks to six pigs. This experimental set-up was repeated three times. The four applications tested were a straw dispenser (Funbar) with fully chopped straw, a MIK Toy (in rolls pressed chopped straw), a rack (long-stemmed straw) and a straw feeder (long-stemmed straw). All pigs (total n = 96) had ad libitum access to straw from one of the applications. Behavior was recorded using video cameras and analyzed per individual pig for week 1 and week 2 of each experimental set-up separately using the logistic mixed model. The rack and straw feeder were explored and manipulated the most (P = 0. 02). In addition, the duration of sustained contact with the application was longer in presence of these applications (P = 0. 0009). This result might be related to the use of long straw. The straw use in presence of the rack was very high, with an average straw use of 2 kg per pen (6 pigs) per week. For all applications, direct contact with the application decreased during the second week compared to the first week. However, this decrease was the smallest in pens with the MIK Toy. Synchronized use of the applications was seen to a small extent, as in most cases not more than two pigs showed application interaction simultaneously. The presence of the Funbar (straw dispenser) was associated with a higher frequency of belly-nosing (P = 0. 03), nosing other body-parts of pen mates (P = 0. 06) and manipulating pen fittings (P = 0. 0002). It has been shown that the use of chopped straw might be related to a higher frequency of manipulating pen-mates, {{but it is not clear}} whether the type of straw explains this result. Growth and the presence of skin lesions did not differ between the applications. It can be concluded that the <b>straw</b> <b>rack</b> and feeder attract 35 pigs to a larger extent. In addition, these applications are associated with longer durations of sustained contact. Straw use however is very high in presence of the rack.

40|$|Pigs need to {{have access}} to {{suitable}} enrichment materials to enable behaviors they are highly motivated to do, in order to prevent the development of unwanted and harmful behavior. These materials are, however, not always easy to apply in intensive housing systems. To our knowledge, only little information is available about enriching strategies that are both easy to apply in these housing systems and fulfill the pig’s needs. The aim of this research was therefore to study the effects of such enriching strategies in practice and, as all pigs {{need to have}} access to enrichment materials, study them in the different production stages at pig farms. In the first study, the effects of a dispenser filled with fully chopped straw on the behavior of confined sows in farrowing crates were investigated. In addition, the behavior and performance of the suckling piglets was also studied. As the effect might depend on the site where the application is provided, two different positions were studied, being in front of and next to the sow. In the latter position, the suckling piglets also had access to the dispenser. Although no significant effects were found on abnormal behavior in sows, differences in straw use between individual sows suggest that the enriching effect might be individually determined. The results also suggest that positioning the dispenser in reach of both sows and piglets is not desirable, as this led to disturbance of the sow’s lying behavior (more ventral lying). In addition, this position of the dispenser was associated with more behavior indicative of discomfort and less udder activity performed by the piglets, which seemed to have resulted in lower weaning weights. Positioning the dispenser in front of the sow resulted in positive effects on lying behavior (more lateral lying) and an indirect positive effect on suckling behavior of the piglets. Because of these positive effects in sows, the same dispenser was applied in pens with weanling pigs in a second study. The intended effect (a lower frequency of pen mate manipulation in pens with a dispenser) was not observed in these pigs. Moreover, behavior related to competition (aggressive behavior) was seen in pens with boars with access to the dispenser. This effect might be related to the position of the dispenser (above the feed trough) and the number of dispensers per pen (one dispenser per 10 – 15 animals). As the frequency of unwanted behavior was not decreased when weanling pigs were given access to a straw dispenser with chopped straw, it was decided to perform a more detailed comparison of different straw-applications in growing pigs, to investigate which one would be the most suitable. Four different applications providing pigs with different straw forms were chosen, being the straw dispenser with chopped straw from the previous studies, a straw feeder (long straw), a <b>straw</b> <b>rack</b> (long straw) and a dispenser filled with compressed straw blocks. Differences in behavioral effects were indeed seen, as well as differences in straw use. The results indicate that the straw dispenser with chopped straw is the least preferred application when considering behavior, as this application was associated with more manipulation of pen fittings and more nosing of pen mates. The straw feeder and <b>straw</b> <b>rack</b> attracted pigs to a larger extent, but the latter application was associated with high amounts of straw used. Taking into account behavioral effects and the amount of straw used per application, the dispenser with compressed straw blocks seemed to be the most suitable application. However, this study only studied effects over a short period (14 days) and, therefore, the effects of the dispenser with straw blocks over a longer period were also investigated. Long-term effects of the dispenser filled with compressed straw blocks were studied by applying this type of dispenser in pens with fattening pigs during the whole fattening period (± 30 to ± 115 kg). Behavior, lesion scores and performance (growth, slaughter results) of these pigs were compared with pigs in pens with only a chain as enrichment material. A distinction was made between pigs based on their genetic background: pigs from boars selected for better growth (type G) and pigs from boars selected for better carcass traits (type C). A lower frequency of harmful behavior (manipulation of pen mates) was recorded in pens with straw blocks, but only in type G pigs. In general, tail-biting levels were higher in type C pigs (leaner pigs) and the presence of straw blocks {{did not seem to be}} sufficient to decrease this behavior. Application interaction was observed during the whole study, suggesting that the straw blocks remained attractive to the pigs. At the beginning of the fattening period (± 30 - ± 60 kg), more mounting and fighting were observed in pens with a straw dispenser when compared to control groups. Thus, it seemed that competition for the dispensers was present. However, this effect was only seen during the first period, suggesting that it was related to introduction in a new environment with enrichment material, which was novel to the pigs. In conclusion, not all straw applications affected the behavior of pigs equally and the effect depended on the production stage. The straw dispenser filled with fully chopped straw increased lateral lying in confined sows, which can be considered as a positive effect as it increased udder access for the suckling piglets. This effect was only seen when the dispenser was positioned outside the reach of the suckling piglets. However, the intended effect (decrease of pen mate manipulation) was not observed in pens with weanling pigs, and it seemed to be a less suitable application for growing/finishing pigs when compared to other straw applications. For the latter group of pigs, compressed straw blocks appeared to be effective in reducing pen mate manipulation and remain attractive to pigs over a longer period when replenished regularly, but the results also show that the genetic background of the pigs should be taken into account. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The broad aims of this {{dissertation}} were {{to investigate}} the motivation of gestating sows for access to environmental enrichments in both stall and group settings and to determine the impact of resource provision on sow behavior. The overarching hypothesis, that sow motivation and behavior would {{vary according to the}} resource provided and due to dominance status when housed in a social context, was tested. To assess motivation, sows were trained to press an operant panel on an increasing schedule for access to resources. The highest schedule pressed (i. e. highest price paid) indicated motivational strength and could be used as an indicator of resource value. ^ In Chapter 2, the impact of rubber mats on the health, behavior and welfare of group-housed sows was explored. Little work exists on the provision of rubber mats to swine; therefore, mat use and value was investigated prior to testing sow motivation for this resource in Chapters 4 and 6. When sows were housed in pens with rubber mats or full concrete flooring, sow behavior varied due to treatment (P 3 ̆c 0. 001), especially resting behaviors. In particular, time spent in different resting postures (sternal versus lateral lying) varied (P = 0. 03), where sows on mats spent more time lying laterally (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), which is thought to indicate increased comfort. Additionally, sows on mats stood up and laid down more frequently (P = 0. 001), which may indicate reduced slipping or reduced pain when making postural adjustments. Sows with mats had a lower total lesion score (P = 0. 03), though lameness scores did not differ between treatments, likely due to the short length of this experiment. These results imply that the provision of rubber mats may provide welfare benefits to sows, especially in relation to lying comfort. ^ In Chapter 4, the motivation of dominant and subordinate sows housed in standard gestation stalls for access to an enriched group pen, containing <b>straw</b> in a <b>rack,</b> compost in a trough, cotton ropes and a rubber mat, was investigated. Additionally, behavioral measures were obtained to determine the effect of social status on sow enrichment use while in the group pen. Subordinate sows compensated for early low enrichment use by increasing their use the following morning during non-peak times (P = 0. 001). These findings demonstrate that regardless of social status, sows were able to access enrichments and valued an enriched group pen. ^ In Chapters 5 and 6, the motivation of sows for access to environmental enrichment in an individual stall was investigated. In Chapter 5, sow motivation for access to compost in a trough or <b>straw</b> in a <b>rack,</b> in comparison to a positive (food) and negative (empty trough) control, was tested. This study demonstrates that compost (as indicated by operant responding) and straw (as indicated by behavioral measures) are valued by sows housed in barren stalls and the provision of these enrichments should be considered as a method to improve sow welfare on farms. ^ In the final experiment, presented in Chapter 6, sow motivation for access to a cotton rope or a rubber mat, in comparison to a positive (food) and negative (empty trough) control, was tested. Sows showed high motivation for food compared to all treatments (all comparisons, P 3 ̆c 0. 05), as indicated by an increase in the highest price paid and a reduction in latency to press the operant panel and enter the treatment stall. However, sow behavior did not differ due to treatment. Although sow motivation for a mat did not differ from an empty trough, previous work has demonstrated the welfare benefits associated with comfort flooring (see Chapter 2). ^ The hypothesis that sow motivation and behavior would vary according to the resource provided and due to dominance status when sows were housed in a social context was supported by the results of all of the experiments described in this dissertation. In particular, sows showed high motivation for access to compost in a trough and <b>straw</b> in a <b>rack,</b> and the provision of these resources should be considered to improve sow welfare in captive settings. However, sows were not highly motivated for a cotton rope or a rubber mat, though mats may offer welfare benefits to sows and warrant further investigation. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
40|$|Summary of thesis entitled: “Food for Rumination – Developing novel feeding {{strategies}} {{to improve the}} welfare of veal calves”, Laura Webb Veal calves are typically fed high levels of milk replacer supplemented with solid feed, which tends to contain a relatively small roughage component. Feeding strategies used in veal production {{have been associated with}} welfare issues, including the development of abnormal oral behaviours (AOB) and poor gastrointestinal health. AOB include tongue playing, excessive oral manipulation of the environment, grazing of the coat of other calves, and sham chewing, and are thought to develop in calves when chewing activity (i. e. eating and rumination) is not adequately stimulated. Common gastrointestinal health issues include poor rumen development and lesions in the abomasum. The aim of this thesis was to develop novel feeding {{strategies to}} improve the welfare of veal calves, i. e. to minimise the development of AOB and gastrointestinal health disorders as well as maximise chewing activity. The EU legislation stipulates a minimum of 250 g of `fibrous feed&# 39; for 20 week-old calves, but this amount does not seem supported by previous research in terms of it optimising calf welfare. In addition, it does not specify what fibrous feed refers to in terms of source and particle length of roughage. Developing novel feeding strategies for calves necessitates {{a better understanding of how}} different roughage characteristics might affect behaviour and gastrointestinal health, and this is what was investigated in Chapter 2. Because none of the single roughage sources investigated were able to improve both behaviour and health, it is likely that a combination of roughage sources would be optimal. For example, an appropriate diet choice may include a combination of roughage sources that facilitate good ruminal papillae development (e. g. maize silage), minimise plaque formation, and encourage both rumen muscularisation and rumination (e. g. straw). This chapter also suggested that hay, as a roughage source with both high levels of structure and high levels of fermentable fibre, could achieve both objectives of encouraging rumination and rumen development. Hay, however, is not used in veal production due to its high iron content that would lead to darker meat colour, which is less preferred by consumers. In Chapter 3, different amounts of a solid feed mixture were fed to calves and behaviour was monitored. The results showed that calves fed no solid feed on top of their milk replacer still displayed a rumination-like behaviour, which was in previous literature referred to as `sham chewing&# 39;. This result gives an indication as to the importance of rumination in calves. Moreover, this chapter failed to find a straightforward linear relationship between amount of solid feed provided and level of AOB displayed. Certain amounts of solid feed were found to initially stimulate chewing activity to a high level, but later, as calves grew older and more experienced with roughage, failed to stimulate chewing above the level displayed by calves fed no solid feed. Providing such an amount of roughage seemed to be more detrimental in terms of behaviour than providing an amount that results in a constant level of chewing activity throughout the fattening period. In order to develop animal-friendly feeding strategies, it is important to know what the animals would choose when given free choice. Therefore, in Chapter 4, the feed preferences of calves for milk replacer, concentrate, hay, straw and maize silage were investigated. This study showed that at 6 months, calves selected on average approximately 1250 g dry matter (DM) milk replacer, 1000 g DM roughage and 2000 g DM concentrate. Although all calves with free choice showed high levels of chewing activity and subsequently low levels of AOB, large individual differences existed in intake levels and feed preferences. Moreover, outcomes were dependent on the variable used to assess preferences: i. e. intake (in g DM relative to metabolic body weight), duration of feeding, or number of visits to each diet component. On average, however, calves showed a preference for milk replacer, concentrate and hay, over straw and maize silage. In contrast to free choice testing, as was used in Chapter 4, double demand operant conditioning gives an indication as to the strength of a preference. In Chapter 5, different methods to analyse data collected from double demand operant conditioning studies were investigated. Due to the dependence level between the two resources presented simultaneously, i. e. at any given time the test animal can only work for one resource, it would seem that proportions of rewards achieved for one resource over the total number of rewards achieved for both resources would be an adequate dependent variable in this type of analysis. In Chapter 6 the statistical method developed in Chapter 5 was used to assess the preference of calves for long and chopped hay and straw, and their preference for hay versus straw. Two to five month-old calves learned the double demand operant task and were motivated to work for roughage on top of a high energy diet of milk replacer and concentrate. They showed a preference for long over chopped hay, but not for long over chopped straw, and showed a strong preference for hay over straw.  In Chapter 7 it was investigated whether temperament might affect learning of a double demand operant task in calves. Studies in horses and voles previously found that certain individuals seemed unable to learn certain tasks. If one could find out why, individual training programs could be designed and non-learners would not be removed from studies, potentially avoiding biases in data due to only certain temperament profiles making it through the learning criteria. Chapter 7 gave some indication that temperament may affect learning in calves, and it is the first study in calves to do so. However, due to the low number of animals used, further research is necessary to confirm which temperamental traits affect learning ability in calves. Relationships between tongue playing and: 1) hypothesised measures of chronic stress, and 2) hypothesised temperamental traits were investigated in Chapter 8. Large individual differences in the performance of tongue playing in calves subjected to similar husbandry conditions were found. This suggests that although tongue playing might well be a warning sign for chronic stress, and hence poor welfare, individual variation in the propensity to tongue play in response to stressful conditions exists. This could be due to differences in temperament. In contrast to what theoretical papers suggest, calves that showed more tongue playing showed characteristics of a reactive coping style. This result is, however, consistent with previous experimental papers on calves and other species. Results from Chapters 2 to 8 were combined into the design of the experiment described in Chapter 9. In this chapter, various feeding strategies (i. e. different amounts of solid feed combined with different concentrate to roughage ratios, different types of ad libitum choice diets, and feeding milk replacer via an open bucket or automated milk dispenser[AMD]) were applied and the effect on behaviour was recorded. Rumination was mainly affected by roughage provision, regardless of concentrate provision. Therefore, increasing solid feed provision without increasing the roughage content would most likely have little effect on rumination, although it would probably increase eating time to a certain extent. Because of the timing of tongue playing and oral manipulation of the environment (found in both Chapters 3 and 9), we suggest that the first of these two AOB is related to chewing activity in general, whereas the second may be more related to anticipation of an upcoming meal and positive reinforcement of feeding behaviours following an unsatisfactory meal. Calves provided ad libitum access to long straw in racks showed high levels of chewing activity and low levels of AOB relative to calves that did not have access to a <b>straw</b> <b>rack</b> but otherwise received the same diet. Six-month-old calves with ad libitum access to straw, maize silage and concentrate (but a restricted milk replacer allowance of 1050 g DM/d) consumed on average approximately 900 g DM/d roughage and 2300 g DM concentrate at 6 months of age. Feeding milk replacer via an AMD seemed to have little impact on behaviour, although it led to lower levels of tongue playing at 15 wk relative to bucket-fed calves. In Chapter 10, I first reflect on possible underlying mechanisms of AOB and on the best methods to assess animal preferences. AOB seem to develop in veal calves due to a number of factors, starting with the thwarting of chewing activity, of which rumination at least is most likely a behavioural need. Other factors involved in the development of AOB include chronic stress resulting from the thwarting of chewing activity, anticipation of an upcoming meal, and positive reinforcement of feeding behaviours following a meal that was unsatisfactory. Of great importance is the understanding of individual variation in the propensity to develop AOB, because stereotypic behaviours in sub-optimal environments have been linked to improvements in welfare (relative to non-stereotyping animals). Ruminants seem to be able to select a diet that maximises their comfort. Developing feeding strategies to improve veal calf welfare, therefore, requires the assessment of calf feed preferences. Choice tests and cross point analysis of double demand functions are two possible methods for the assessment of animal preferences, and both these methods include drawbacks and benefits. In contrast to choice tests, double demand offers a setting that closer mimics the complexity of natural environments by imposing a cost on access to resources and enables quantification of the strength of preferences. However, this procedure requires appropriate statistical methods, which take into account the dependence structure between the two simultaneously available resources. Finally, practical implications of the research presented in this thesis are described in Chapter 10. The development of novel feeding strategies to improve the welfare of veal calves is challenged by individual differences in feed preferences, chewing efficiency, and behavioural response to chronic stress caused by inadequate feeding. The latter is demonstrated by only certain calves developing AOB when chewing activity is not stimulated enough by the feeding strategy, whilst others do not develop such behaviours. This complicates the evaluation of the effects of feeding strategy on veal calf behaviour. However, based on the results of this thesis and previous research it seems that young calves should first receive a diet that optimises rumen development, before receiving coarser roughages that stimulate chewing activity, rumen muscularisation, and minimise plaque and hairball prevalence in the rumen. Adequate amounts of roughage and concentrate at 6 months of age seem to be 1000 and 2000 - 3000 g DM, based on voluntary intake.  ...|$|E
