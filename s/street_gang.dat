5|$|Baltimore {{was home}} to a major doo wop scene {{in the middle of}} the 20th century, which began with The Orioles, who are {{considered}} one of the first doo wop groups to record commercially. By the 1950s, Baltimore {{was home to}} numerous African American vocal groups, and talent scouts scoured the city for the next big stars. Many bands emerged from the city, including The Cardinals and The Plants. Some doo wop groups were connected with street gangs, and some members were active in both scenes, such as Johnny Page of The Marylanders. Competitive music and dance was a part of African American <b>street</b> <b>gang</b> culture, and with the success of some local groups, pressure mounted, leading to territorial rivalries among performers. Pennsylvania Avenue served as a rough boundary between East and West Baltimore, with the East producing The Swallows and The Cardinals, as well as The Sonnets, The Jollyjacks, The Honey Boys, The Magictones and The Blentones, while the West was home to The Orioles and The Plants, as well as The Twilighters and The Four Buddies.|$|E
5|$|Billy Boys {{originated}} in the 1920s as the signature tune of the Brigton Boys, also called The Billy Boys of Brigton Cross, who were a Protestant <b>street</b> <b>gang</b> in the Bridgeton area of Glasgow, led by Billy Fullerton. The gang often clashed with Roman Catholic gangs such as the Norman Conks. Fullerton was {{a former member of}} the British Fascists who was awarded a medal for strike-breaking during the 1926 General Strike and formed a Glasgow branch of the British Union of Fascists with the onset of World War II. The song's geographic roots relate to Bridgeton Cross in Bridgeton, an area of Glasgow historically associated with the city's Protestant population, and with Scottish unionism. Brigton is the Scots form of Bridgeton. The Billy Boys song was often sung loudly when the gang performed it. They regularly sang it when they marched through primarily Catholic areas of Glasgow on Catholic holy days. This often led to the Brigton Boys being attacked by members of the Norman Conks as a result. Despite being primarily based in Glasgow, in the 1930s the Brigton Boys were invited to march in Belfast and sang Billy Boys while they were there as part of The Twelfth celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Hasselbaink {{was born}} on 27 March 1972 in Paramaribo, Suriname (then part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), to Frank Ware and Cornelli Hasselbaink; he was the {{youngest}} of six children. At the age of three Hasselbaink was run over by a moped which broke his right leg. In October 1978, his mother took him and three siblings to live in Zaandam, Netherlands; his father remained in Suriname and rarely contacted the family. The next year Hasselbaink began playing youth football for Gestaagt Volharding Overwint (GVO), initially as a goalkeeper. He later played for Zaansche Football club (ZFC) and Zaanlandia as a right winger. He joined a <b>street</b> <b>gang</b> as a teenager and spent three months in a youth detention facility for stealing. After his release he joined the youth team at DWS, but was dismissed from the club for stealing the watch of a first-team player. He began his senior career with Telstar, while still a gang member, and had disciplinary issues at the club due to his persistent lateness. He made his Eerste Divisie debut on 27 October 1990, in a 2–0 defeat at VVV-Venlo. Head coach Niels Overweg dismissed him after he turned up late to a match.|$|E

40|$|<b>Street</b> <b>gangs</b> {{function}} as ongoing, open social systems {{in relation to}} their surrounding sociocultural context. Fundamentally, gangs are comparable to some family systems. In fact, most gangs do consider themselves to be “families. ” The same concepts used to describe family systems may also be applied to <b>street</b> <b>gangs.</b> <b>Street</b> <b>gangs</b> usually exhibit a highly complex organization, structure, process, and func-tionality. All of these aspects intertwine within and around the gang to form a web of interconnectedness and continuity. To better un-derstand <b>street</b> <b>gangs</b> and provide effective intervention plans, they must be viewed from this systematic and holistic perspective. <b>Street</b> <b>gangs</b> have been documented in cities in the U.
