As explained by his alternate timeline counterpart Black Zero and shown when Superboy himself was aged to an adult by Klarion, Superboy gained new powers such as heat vision and super hearing when he matured to full age as well as gained a higher form of increased telekinesis, strength and greater invulnerability.|$|E

50|$|Working with Bell Telephone {{scientists}} Daryl Chapin and Gerald Pearson, Fuller diffused boron into silicon {{to capture}} the sun's power.
