Braathens SAFE <b>started</b> <b>taking</b> {{delivery}} of Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F-28s in 1969, and these gradually took {{over most of}} the domestic routes. In 1970, Air France and Swissair started flying to Fornebu from Paris and Zurich, respectively. They were supplemented by Aeroflot's Moscow route in 1972.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} concerts, the group flew to New York's Record Plant Studios at Lambert's suggestion, for studio recordings. The group {{were joined by}} guests Al Kooper on Hammond organ, Ken Ascher on piano and Leslie West on guitar. Townshend used a 1957 Gretsch guitar, {{given to him by}} Joe Walsh, during the session and it went on to become his main guitar for studio recording. Lambert's {{participation}} in the recording was minimal, and he proved to be unable to mix the final recordings. He had <b>started</b> <b>taking</b> hard drugs, while Townshend was drinking brandy regularly. After returning to Britain, engineer Glyn Johns made safety copies of the Record Plant material but decided {{that it would be better}} to re-record it from scratch at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes.|$|E
5|$|Born's {{position}} at Cambridge {{was only a}} temporary one, and his tenure at Göttingen was terminated in May 1935. He therefore accepted an offer from C. V. Raman to go to Bangalore in 1935. Born considered taking a permanent position there, but the Indian Institute of Science did not create an additional chair for him. In November 1935, the Born family had their German citizenship revoked, rendering them stateless. A few weeks later Göttingen cancelled Born's doctorate. Born considered an offer from Pyotr Kapitsa in Moscow, and <b>started</b> <b>taking</b> Russian lessons from Rudolf Peierls's Russian-born wife Genia. But then Charles Galton Darwin asked Born if he would consider becoming his successor as Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, an offer that Born promptly accepted, assuming the chair in October 1936.|$|E
5|$|Brooks' first {{venture into}} wrestling was {{a stint in}} a {{backyard}} wrestling federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s. He first started using the ring name CM Punk when he was put into a tag team named The Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the card. Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely {{wanted to be a}} wrestler and saw it as more than simple fun. When the promotion <b>started</b> <b>taking</b> off, doing shows out of a warehouse in Mokena, Illinois, Punk found out that his brother Mike had embezzled thousands of dollars from the small company, causing them to become estranged. They have not spoken since.|$|E

He <b>started</b> <b>taking</b> an active interest {{in the politics of}} India's independence struggle against British rule, working behind the scenes as his position in the Baroda state administration barred him from overt political activity. He linked up with resistance groups in Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, while traveling to these states. He established contact with Lokmanya Tilak and Sister Nivedita. He arranged the military training of Jatindra Nath Banerjee (Niralamba Swami) in the Baroda army and then dispatched him to organise the resistance groups in Bengal.|$|E

5|$|Keen {{to follow}} up his {{interest}} in aviation, Johnson <b>started</b> <b>taking</b> flying lessons at his own expense. He applied to join the Auxiliary Air Force (AAF) but encountered some of the social problems that were rife in British society at the time. Johnson strongly felt he was rejected {{on the grounds of}} his class status. Johnson's fortunes were to improve. As the chances of war increased {{in the aftermath of the}} Munich Crisis, the standards of the RAF were relaxed, however, as the service expanded and brought in men from ordinary social backgrounds. Johnson re-applied to the AAF. He was informed that sufficient pilots were already available but there were some vacancies in the balloon squadrons. Johnson rejected the offer.|$|E
5|$|Laubenstein {{developed}} appendicitis in 1984 and {{was afraid}} to undergo surgery {{because of the risk}} that general anesthesia would pose to her lungs, already compromised from polio. After the operation, her surgeons had trouble weaning her off the ventilator and she suffered a psychotic breakdown requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital; the psychiatrists theorized that her hallucinations were caused by hypoxia from the anesthesia. In 1990, she fell ill with a combination of asthma, gastroenteritis and respiratory failure, though she continued to work. She <b>started</b> <b>taking</b> corticosteroids for her respiratory problems—which were exacerbated by allergies to her two pet cats—and was unable to wean herself off them despite experiencing side effects.|$|E

Around this time, II./JG 1 had moved to airfield at Marienehe and also <b>started</b> <b>taking</b> delivery of the He 162. These new jet aircraft would never see widespread combat with JG 1 due to their late introduction and a shortage of pilots, aircraft and fuel. JG 1 could no longer field their full complement or effectively fly operations as required.|$|E

5|$|Several actresses were {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Tatiana, including Italians Sylva Koscina and Virna Lisi, Danish actress Annette Vadim, and English-born Tania Mallet. 1960 Miss Universe runner-up Daniela Bianchi was ultimately cast, supposedly Sean Connery's choice. Bianchi <b>started</b> <b>taking</b> English classes for the role, but the producers ultimately chose to have her lines redubbed by British stage actress Barbara Jefford in the final cut. The scene in which Bond finds Tatiana in his hotel bed was used for Bianchi's screen test, with Dawson standing in, this time, as Bond. The scene later became the traditional screen test scene for prospective James Bond actors and Bond Girls.|$|E
