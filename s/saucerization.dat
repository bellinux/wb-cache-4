5000|$|Initial {{first-line}} antibiotic {{choice is}} determined by the patient's history and regional differences in common infective organisms. A treatment lasting 42 days is practiced in a number of facilities. Local and sustained availability of drugs have proven to be more effective in achieving prophylactic and therapeutic outcomes. Open surgery is needed for chronic osteomyelitis, whereby the involucrum is opened and the sequestrum is removed or sometimes <b>saucerization</b> can be done.

5000|$|A <b>saucerization</b> biopsy is {{also known}} as [...] "scoop", [...] "scallop", or [...] "shave" [...] excisional biopsy, or [...] "shave" [...] excision. A trend has {{occurred}} in dermatology over the last 10 years with the advocacy of a deep shave excision of a pigmented lesion. An author published the result of this method and advocated it as better than standard excision and less time consuming. The added economic benefit is that many surgeons bill the procedure as an excision, rather than a shave biopsy. This saves the added time for hemostasis, instruments, and suture cost. The great disadvantage, seen years later, is the numerous scallop scars, and a very difficult to deal with lesion called a [...] "recurrent melanocytic nevus". What has happened is that many [...] "shave" [...] excisions do not penetrate the dermis or subcutanous fat enough to include the entire melanocytic lesion. Residual melanocytes regrow into the scar. The combination of scarring, inflammation, blood vessels, and atypical pigmented streaks seen in these recurrent nevi may result in the dermatoscopic appearance of a melanoma. When a second physician later examines the patient, he or she {{has no choice but to}} recommend re-excision of the scar. If one does not have access to the original pathology report, it is impossible to distinguish a recurring nevus from a severely dysplastic nevus or melanoma. As the procedure is widely practiced, it is not unusual to see a patient with dozens of scallop scars, with as many as 20% of them showing residual pigmentation. The second issue with the shave excision is fat herniation, iatrogenic anetoderma, and hypertrophic scarring. As the deep shave excision either completely removes the full thickness of the dermis or greatly diminishes the dermal thickness, subcutanous fat can herniate outward or pucker the skin out in an unattractive way. In areas prone to friction, this can result in pain, itching, or hypertrophic scarring.|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionTreatment of {{symptomatic}} discoid meniscus {{in children}} is <b>saucerization</b> performed under arthroscopy. The strategy to adopt for associated meniscus lesions is discussed, from partial meniscectomy to meniscal repair. The latter was {{applied in the}} series studied herein. The objective was to assess this surgical strategy. PatientsThis was a retrospective study of 20  discoid menisci (18  patients) operated between 2004 and 2007. MethodThe patients first underwent arthroscopic <b>saucerization</b> and then, a procedure that depended on the residual meniscus: no additional procedure {{if there was no}} lesion, suturing or reinsertion in cases with a repairable lesion, and partial meniscectomy in cases of a non repairable lesion. All patients were assessed clinically and with postoperative MRI. ResultsThe mean follow-up was 37 months. Five discoid menisci presented no lesion and were treated with isolated <b>saucerization.</b> Fifteen discoid menisci presented a lesion. In four cases, <b>saucerization</b> removed this lesion. In eight cases, we performed meniscal repair after <b>saucerization.</b> In three cases, partial meniscectomy was necessary. The Lysholm score ranged from 67 to 88. Sixteen patients were satisfied or very satisfied in 16  cases. The mean Tegner score was 5. 9. Postoperative MRI showed no signs of chondral degeneration. The mean measurements of the residual meniscus corresponded to the guidelines. Patients having undergone <b>saucerization</b> associated with meniscal repair had better results than those who had partial meniscectomy or meniscus repair alone (P= 0. 007, Fisher test). DiscussionNo other study having evaluated discoid meniscus surgery with postoperative MRI has been reported and few studies have been published on <b>saucerization</b> associated with repair. This approach spares the meniscus, as confirmed by MRI, with the size of the residual meniscus within the guidelines. We obtained good clinical and anatomic results, with good healing of the meniscus and satisfactory measurements. Level of evidenceLevel III. Retrospective study...|$|E

40|$|The {{prevention}} of primary infections {{of the hand}} in injuries comprises essentially that of tetanus, gas gangrene, and the infection itself. The infections mentioned are panaris, phlegmon, the sequels of bites and gas gangrene. The treatment of panaris is immediate surgery. This consists of incision-excision without closure. That of the phlegmons is urgent. It depends {{on the stage of}} development of the infection and on the topography of the phlegmon. At stage 1 the authors advise filiform drainage. In stages II and III the treatment comprises <b>saucerization</b> and excision of the necrosed tissues, as well as cutaneous closure. The early treatment of bites may be medical if the portals of entry remain open. The only really efficacious treatment of gas gangrene is early surgical <b>saucerization.</b> The authors support their conclusions by a homogeneous series of 52 cases.

The use of RCM in assessing responses to <b>saucerization</b> or curettage and cautery of BCC has not been established. The aim {{of the present study}} was to expound the usefulness of RCM in assessing treatment responses of BCC to <b>saucerization</b> or curettage and cautery 8 - 12 weeks after treatment. Methods: Eight sequential patients, with 11 superficial BCCs, were recruited. Lesions were evaluated clinically and dermoscopically. Three operators performed RCM imaging for each BCC at baseline and 8 - 12 weeks after treatment. Diagnostic criteria for RCM diagnosis included streaming of basal cells and the presence of cord-like structures and horizontal vessels. Results were compared against histopathology. Difficulties in establishing tumour clearance were identified and the effectiveness of RCM in assessing the response to treatment was explored. Results: At baseline, all lesions were consistent with superficial BCC. At 8 - 12 weeks after treatment, RCM correctly diagnosed 10 of 11 lesions as tumour free. Furthermore, RCM was reliable across operators of variable experience and the findings were confirmed histopathologically. Limitations were identified, but appeared to be related to operator experience. Conclusion: The diagnosis of BCC was straightforward and reliable in the present study. Thus, RCM appears useful in assessing the early treatment response of superficial BCC treated with <b>saucerization</b> or curettage and cautery despite operator-dependant limitations. © 2011 The Authors.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{sought to}} examine the aspects of crestal bone {{resorption}} and to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the TiUnite 䠶 (Nobel Biocare, Sweden) anodized implant system. Materials and Methods: Among the 67 patients (211 fixtures) who were treated using TiUnite(r) implants at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital between March 2004 and January 2007, 26 (91 fixtures) were considered in this study. Initial and secondary stabilities were measured using Periotest 䠶 and Ostell(tm) Mentor. The radiographic evaluation of crestal bone resorption {{was carried out by}} measuring the change in crestal bone level at the time of surgery compared to that 1 year after loading. Panoramic radiograph and periapical radiograph were used. Based on the radiographic findings, the shapes of crestal bone resorption were classified. Results: The average amount of crestal bone resorption after 1 year of functional implant loading was 0. 30 mm. There was no <b>saucerization</b> in 40 implant fixtures (43. 9 %), although more than 1 thread were exposed in 51 implant fixtures (56. 6 %).

30|$|Histologic {{analysis}} was performed only on the resected fragment instead on the whole meniscus. In a previous study, Hamada et al. (Hamada, 1994) resected discoid lateral menisci “en-block” and analyzed the entire meniscus. Given {{the importance of the}} meniscus in load distribution, lubrication, and cushioning, the current trend in meniscal preservation surgery, and the long-term outcomes in favor of <b>saucerization</b> over total meniscectomy (Smuin et al., 2017), we believe it is not ethical to resect “en block” an entire meniscus in children and adolescents.

40|$|In World War II early, {{adequate}} surgical care, rapid evacuation, and t. hie use of chemothierapeutic and antibiotic agents {{made possible}} early closure of compotund wounds by delayed sutures. The {{number of cases}} of osteomyehitis developing from compound fractures was, therefore, creditably small. Delayed primary or early secondany closure was not attempted in all cases. Many wounds were healed or almost healed by the time the men reached a permanent installation. In other cases, cIounre was not attempted, because of the severity of the infection or ’ the multiplicity and extent of the wounds.

Surgical intervention is considered worthwhile in those cases that show a marked rocker-bottom foot deformity on lateral radiography and have a persistent ulcer after conservative treatment in a plaster cast. The neuropathic foot is an entity that can have 20 or more causes. A sensory neuropathy of some degree seems always to be present, but the exact etiology of the disorder is not perfectly understood.

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{classical}} {{method of}} treatment of chronic osteomyelitis with sequestrum needs <b>saucerization</b> and sequestrectomy which become quite difficult when small sequesrtrae are spread over a long span in medullary canal. To saucerize such a long segment is not only difficult, it may be dangerous because of excessive blood loss and mechanically the bone become weak. A pathological fracture or iatrogenic fracture is definite possibility. Intramedullary reaming has its selected indication in osteomyelitis of long bones when remnants of dead infected bone are intramedullary embedded in an endosteal new bone formation. Previously intramedullary reaming with irrigation and suction was devised for treatment {{of this type of}} chronic osteomyelitis of long bones. This needed complex and costly instrumentation which cannot be afforded by all the orthopaedic surgeons. So, a new technique was developed without any extra instrumentation and expenditure ensuring complete removal of sequestrum. MATERIALS AND METHODS The suitable patients coming to OPD were selected. Total of 5 patients were treated by this method and results noted in the form of recurrence, subsidence of discharge and range of motion of adjacent joints, hospital stay, need of dressing, morbidity, pain level. RESULTS In very short follow up of about 2 - 4 years there has been no recurrence (clinically and radiologically), complete subsidence of discharging sinuses and without any further loss of range of motion of adjacent joints. CONCLUSION The presenting operative procedure for achieving the goal of treating chronic intramedullary osteomyelitis in short term period was very well achieved in all the cases. Since there is no extra instrumentation and no extra learning needed, this procedure can be done by any orthopaedic surgeon without involving any extra cost to the patients...|$|E
