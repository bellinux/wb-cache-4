50|$|A <b>sand</b> <b>rammer</b> is a {{piece of}} {{equipment}} used in foundry sand testing to make test specimen of molding sand by compacting bulk material by free fixed height drop of fixed weight for 3 times. It is also used to determine compactibility of sands by using special specimen tubes and a linear scale.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>rammer</b> {{consists}} of calibrated sliding weight actuated by cam, a shallow cup to accommodate specimen tube below ram head, a specimen stripper to strip compacted specimen out of specimen tube, a specimen tube {{to prepare the}} standard specimen of 50 mm diameter by 50 mm height or 2 inch diameter by 2 inch height for an AFS standard specimen.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sand</b> <b>rammer</b> machine {{can be used}} {{to measure}} compactability of {{prepared}} sand by filling the specimen tube with prepared sand so that it is level with the top of the tube. The tube is then placed under the ram head in the shallow cup and rammed three times. Compactability in percentage is then calculated from the resultant height of the sand inside the specimen tube.|$|E
40|$|Occupational {{exposures}} to hand-arm vibration and dust {{have been shown}} to have deleterious human health effects. Exposure to vibration from pneumatic tools can result in Hand-arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS), which is a collection of vascular, sensorineural, and musculoskeletal disorders. Exposure to dust can result in a variety of adverse respiratory symptoms. The use of a low-frequency, high-magnitude <b>sand</b> <b>rammer</b> tool during mold-making processes at a foundry could result in significant exposure to these hazards, thus it is important to mitigate the associated risks in order to ensure worker safety. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether different pneumatic pressure levels and <b>sand</b> <b>rammer</b> types have an effect on reducing hand-arm vibration and dust exposures at a foundry. Vibration and dust measurements were obtained at three different pneumatic pressure levels (90 psi, 80 psi, 70 psi) and for three different <b>sand</b> <b>rammer</b> types (LM, SM, T). The primary concern of the study was reducing hand-arm vibration exposure. Measurements were taken in compliance with ISO 5349 - 1 resulting in frequency-weighted, root-mean-square (rms) acceleration values (m/s 2). Significant differences in mean rms acceleration were observed across all pneumatic pressure levels and <b>sand</b> <b>rammer</b> types. At 90 psi the mean rms acceleration value was 25. 53 m/s 2, decreasing to 19. 58 m/s 2 at 80 psi, and further decreasing to 18. 38 m/s 2 at 70 psi. The mean rms acceleration values were 19. 63 m/s 2 for <b>sand</b> <b>rammer</b> LM, 21. 46 m/s 2 for SM, and 19. 95 m/s 2 for T. The results of this study indicate that reducing pneumatic pressure levels can reduce vibration exposure in the workplace when using low-frequency, high-magnitude tools. The results also indicate that the use of different <b>sand</b> <b>rammer</b> types produces differences in vibration exposure when tested across all pneumatic pressure levels. Dust measurements were taken concurrently with vibration measurements. The number of dust particles was counted for each pneumatic pressure level and <b>sand</b> <b>rammer</b> type. Overall, the mean particle count for the dust measurements was the highest at 90 psi (41, 681) followed by 70 psi (33, 514), and 80 psi (26, 047). <b>Sand</b> <b>rammer</b> SM had the highest mean dust particle count at 35, 732, followed by T at 34, 460, and LM at 31, 382. The results indicate that lowering pneumatic pressure levels could potentially reduce dust exposure in the workplace when using a percussive tool such as a <b>sand</b> <b>rammer.</b> However, variability in the sampling conditions related to dust measurements weaken the association...|$|E

The Sand Muller was designed to help foundry industries in Nigeria as well as small-scale foundries acquire basic foundry equipment to test and control raw materials {{in order to improve}} castings quality. In designing the <b>Sand</b> <b>Rammer,</b> systematic design analysis of the basic theories required to make it functional were considered. The Sand Muller was fabricated from locally sourced materials, tested and found to produce sand mix of adequate strength for casting purposes...|$|E
