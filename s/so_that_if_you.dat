500|$|Ofcom {{estimates}} {{that even after}} extra spectrum has been allocated to DAB, around 90local radio stations {{will be unable to}} transmit on DAB, either because there is no space for them on a local DAB multiplex, or because they cannot afford the high transmission costs of DAB that the multiplex operators are charging. Ofcom announced in 2005 that it regarded Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) as an option for local stations unable to secure carriage or unable to pay the high transmission costs of DAB. The success of the small scale DAB multiplexes may alleviate this issue to some degree. One of the drawbacks of DAB and DAB+ has not been addressed. In simple terms the frequency of a broadcast is the carrier frequency (i.e. a sine wave). In order to carry any information the carrier frequency must be modulated. The signal at the receiver (radio) is then demodulated and the information is retrieved. The demodulators for FM signals are almost instantaneous so that one can have radios in different areas and move between those areas to hear the broadcast continuously. In contrast the demodulators for digital signals take a finite time and each digital radio takes a different time to demodulate the broadcast signal, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> move between different radios that are spatially apart you are likely to hear the same part of the broadcast twice or miss parts of it depending on the time to demodulate the signal of the individual radios. The other drawback with DAB is that it is all or nothing. If there is any interference or loss due to moving out of the footprint of the broadcast signal you will receive no signal, whereas in the case of FM you can hear something even if it is crackly.|$|E

And she lost a lot of weight <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> looked at her, you would say she could pass from the arms up as a dancer. She's an amazing actor. I can't act like that. But to say that she did all of the dancing is {{absolutely}} ridiculous to anyone that knows anything about ballet." ...|$|E

6000|$|... {{and left}} it {{indelible}} there, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> now <b>if</b> <b>you</b> thrust your finger through the grille and touch the place you get off three hundred years of purgatory: not much in the count of eternity, but still something.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, fie!--anything {{in the way}} of civility," [...] replied Smith. [...] "They are, in truth, the best-natured lads alive, when treated respectfully; <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would prefer----" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My {{own room}} {{is the second}} on the left, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should feel {{that you are in}} need of company a call would always bring me to your side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{history is}} <b>so</b> remarkable, <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{do not give}} it, [...] {{somebody}} else will most certainly give it; and perhaps so as nearly [...] {{to do as much}} harm as your own management of the thing might do [...] good.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{according}} as {{you happen}} to merit, sir," [...] said I: [...] "for your mode of speaking to this young lady is <b>so</b> unbecoming, <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do not change your tone, I shall think it worth while to chastise you myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] {{cried the}} girl, shaking her head. [...] "No! Couldn't find them. And {{she was so}} faint, and lame, and miserable, Oh <b>so</b> wretched, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had seen her, Mr. Snagsby, you'd have given her half a crown, I know!" ...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not think}} it very {{probable}} that anything win come of this, but I have thought best to notify you <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should see signs you may understand them.|$|E

6000|$|Jac. Apropos! I {{have been}} {{retrieving}} an old song of a lover, that was ever quarrelling with his mistress: I {{think it will}} fit our amour <b>so</b> well, <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please, I'll give it you for an epithalamium; and you shall sing it.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{put in the}} uncle, [...] "and I shall charge {{nothing for}} the use of the boat; <b>so</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> volunteer, Gar'ner, it will leave so much towards {{settling}} up the man's accounts, when settling day comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then {{have them}} all packed up,--as small as you can; never mind about wool and cases and all that. Have them close to your hand <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have to move you can take them with you. Do you understand?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As much as {{you think}} it best," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "I leave every thing to you.

6000|$|... "Not so. You {{will pass}} through a zone of heat, but <b>so</b> swiftly <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> hold your breath you will not suffer overmuch. Then you will come {{to a place where}} a great draught blows which will keep you cool, and thence travel on to the end." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Hardly," [...] {{said the}} bishop, [...] "but let me advise {{you not to}} go very far from the shore, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> feel tired you can come in easily, and if you will allow me I will walk down the shore in the {{direction}} in which you intend to row." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Mike," [...] Desmond said, [...] "I suppose, in a campaign, a {{good many}} of you carry what money you may have about you, and I dare say some of you hide it <b>so</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are taken prisoners, you may have means of adding to your prison fare." ...|$|E
60|$|But I, dear reader, {{am quite}} as {{communicative}} as Mrs. Patten, and much better informed; <b>so</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> care {{to know more}} about the Vicar's courtship and marriage, you need only carry your imagination back to the latter end of the last century, and your attention forward into the next chapter.|$|E

"The ledge is narrow," [...] he said, [...] "and {{the current}} {{crossing}} it is strong, {{but from what}} I've seen of you I think you will manage to wade out if you go cautiously, and don't lose heart.

6000|$|... "Be {{sure you}} don't show your head above the barricade, Bertie.

6000|$|No! sweet blue-eyed girl! my plots {{are not of}} that {{extremely}} guessable nature so {{admired by}} your adorable sex.
