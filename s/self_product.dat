Cold target competition {{studies at the}} lytic phase demonstrated three distinct patterns of cytotoxic responsiveness: (a) H- 2 b spleen cells generated approximately equivalent CTL responses against Kb and Db modified <b>self</b> <b>products,</b> (b) H- 2 d spleen cells generated preferential responses against Dd modified <b>self</b> <b>products,</b> and (c) H- 2 k spleen cells generated cytotoxic responses which could only be detected against Kk <b>self</b> <b>products</b> in association with TNP. F 1 spleen cells were sensitized against autologous TNBS-treated cells. The results showed that, although H- 2 b parental cells generated approximately equivalent Kb-TNP- and Db-TNP-specific CTL, {{the presence of the}} H- 2 b haplotype did not result in the generation of (a) Dk-TNP CTL response by (H- 2 b x H- 2 k) spleen cells, nor (b) a Db CTL response by (H- 2 b x H- 2 a) F 1 spleen cells. Additionally, (H- 2 d x H- 2 k) F 1 cells failed to generate detectable Dd-TNP-specific CTL, although H- 2 d parental cells generated D-regional-specific CTL. The findings demonstrated that these F 1 response patterns paralleled those of the H- 2 k and H- 2 a parents, i. e. weak or no D-region TNP-specific CTL were induced. Because (H- 2 d x H- 2 a) F 1 responders stimulated with H- 2 d TNBS-treated cells did generate good Dd TNP responses, the results illustrated that the presence of responder genes was not sufficient to result in a D-region TNP CML. It is suggested that the absence of Kk alleles on the stimulating population is necessary for the generation of D-region TNP CTL in these F 1 's. Mechanisms which could account for these response patterns in parental F 1 mice are discussed including immunodominance, suppression, T-cell response, and Ir-gene defects...|$|R

40|$|My goal is {{to prove}} the Hodge [H] and Tate [T 1] conjectures in certain {{situations}} where the appropriately defined monodromy group is as large as possible. In particular, that these conjectures hold for an arbitrary power (i. e. <b>self</b> <b>product)</b> of an odd dimensional hypersurface in a toric or flag variety, or for the moduli space UX(n, d) of vector bundles over a smooth projective curve X provided that the monodromy group of the hypersurface or curve is large. Over the field of complex numbers, almost all (in the sense of Baire category) hypersurfaces of a fixed degree of a given variety or curves of a fixed genus {{will turn out to}} have a large monodromy group. This yields a proof (not too different from the original) of a theorem of Biswas and Narasimhan [BN] that the Hodge conjecture is valid for UX(n, d) over a general curve. Over a countable field, subtler criteria are needed to ensure that the monodromy group is large.

The study investigates the effect of marketing medium of telecommunication as a proxy for advertisement on preference of telecommunication services as a proxy for consumer choice in Nigeria. The Binary Logit Model (BLM) and descriptive analytical frameworks are used to evaluate the statistical importance of advertisement, quality of services, income of the consumer, <b>product’s</b> <b>self</b> and related service charges for a consumer choice of telecommunication services through Wald test.

40|$|Abstract. We rst {{develop a}} notion of {{quadratic}} form on a locally compact abelian group. Under suitable hypotheses, we construct a probability measure {{on the set of}} closed maximal isotropic subspaces of a locally compact quadratic space over Fp. A random subspace chosen with respect to this measure is discrete with probability 1, and the dimension of its intersection with a xed compact open maximal isotropic subspace is a certain nonnegativeinteger-valued random variable. We then prove that the p-Selmer group of an elliptic curve is naturally the intersection of a discrete maximal isotropic subspace with a compact open maximal isotropic subspace in a locally compact quadratic space over Fp. By modeling the rst subspace as being random, we can explain the known phenomena regarding distribution of Selmer ranks, such as the theorems of Heath-Brown and Swinnerton-Dyer for 2 -Selmer groups in certain families of quadratic twists, and the average size of 2 - and 3 -Selmer groups as computed by Bhargava and Shankar. The only distribution on Mordell-Weil ranks compatible with both our random model and Delaunay's heuristics for p-torsion in Shafarevich-Tate groups is the distribution in which 50 % of elliptic curves have rank 0, and 50 % have rank 1. We generalize many of our results to abelian varieties over global elds.

Immune responses should however, be tightly controlled to ensure tolerance to the body’s own cells and proteins in order to limit damage to the host own cells and tissue. Autoimmune diseases can arise when the balance between pathogen-driven immunity (inflammatory immune response) and tolerance (regulatory immune response) to <b>self</b> <b>products</b> is dysregulated. Dendritic cells are immune cells with the ability to direct immune responses towards an inflammatory or regulatory immune reaction. During immune homeostasis, i. e. in the absence of infectious or inflammatory stimulation, dendritic cells reside in state that contributes to immune tolerance. In this condition, dendritic cells are a promising immunotherapeutic target in autoimmune diseases. These tolerance inducing properties can be enhanced and stabilized under laboratory conditions. Stress proteins are imperative for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and are especially produced after forms of stress like: increased temperature (fever), nutritional deficiency and exposure to toxins, inflammatory mediators and viral infections. Stress proteins are also highly immunogenic and have the potential to induce immuno-regulatory pathways. The research described in this dissertation focuses on the in vitro induction and stabilization of a regulatory phenotype in dendritic cells via administration of stress proteins to dendritic cells, or otherwise via treatment of dendritic cells with a physiological stress to ensure production of stress proteins by dendritic cells.
