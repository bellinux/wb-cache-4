Making a deep pit, many teeth they dropped therein. But they could not fill it. Hence, they called it the <b>Sinking</b> <b>Pit,</b> for bottom it had none. Nevertheless, the magi said, when this pit is filled, Bello's hump you'll see no more. [...] "Then, hurrah for the hump!" [...] cried the nobles, [...] "for he will never hurl it off. Long life to the hump! By the hump we will rally and die! Cheer up, King Bello! Stand up, old king!" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{colliery}} {{was started}} around 1750 by Richard Bingley but {{was taken over}} in 1752 by the 2nd Marquis of Rockingham and by 1757 comprised eight pits in and around Elsecar Green. The pits were sunk {{to a depth of}} 15 metres to exploit the Barnsley Bed. The pits were described as three air pits or ventilation shafts, two open pits, one closed pit, one working pit and one <b>sinking</b> <b>pit.</b> They were worked using a horse gin - a horse powered winch. From 1750 until about 1795 the pits employed around nine men. In 1782 the 2nd Marquis of Rockingham died and his estates were inherited by his cousin the 4th Earl Fitzwilliam. He expanded Elsecar Old Colliery and installed steam winding engines in 1796 and by 1848 the pit was employing 87 men and boys. The colliery was renamed Elsecar High Colliery in the same year. By now the colliery was centred on the Milton Foundry. The colliery closed when its reserves were exhausted in 1888.|$|E
50|$|Hulton {{established}} the Hulton Colliery Company in 1858 with a partner, Harwood Walcot Banner. After Hulton's death in 1864 his son, William F. Hulton succeeded him {{and became the}} sole owner in 1868 when the partnership was dissolved. The company <b>sank</b> <b>pits</b> near Chequerbent. The Arley Pits and the School Pit were sunk north of the Manchester road and older workings were abandoned. The new pits were linked to the Bolton and Leigh Railway line at Pendlebury Fold where the company built brickworks.|$|R

6000|$|According {{to local}} modern {{tradition}} this scatter of masonry {{was the original}} site of the settlement, called after the builder Bir el-Sa'idáni--"the Well of Sa'ídán." [...] For watering each caravan the proprietor demanded a camel by way of fee; at last a Maghribí, that is, a magician, refused to [...] "part;" [...] betook himself to the present camping ground, <b>sank</b> <b>pits,</b> and let loose the copious springs. The old wells then dried up, and the new sources gave to {{this section of the}} great Wady 'Afál its actual name, Wady el-Badá--"of the innovation," [...] so hateful to the conservative savage. Hence Rüppell's [...] "Beden," [...] which would mean an ibex.|$|R
6000|$|... [14] I quote Lieut. Cruttenden. The Berberah {{water has}} {{acquired}} a bad name because the people confine themselves to digging holes three or four feet deep in the sand, about half-a-mile from high-water mark. They are reconciled to it by its beneficial effects, especially after and before a journey. Good water, however, can be procured {{in any of the}} Fiumaras intersecting the plain; when the Hajj Sharmarkay's towers commanded the town wells, the people <b>sank</b> <b>pits</b> in low ground a few hundred yards distant, and procured a purer beverage. The Banyans, who are particular about their potations, drink the sweet produce of Siyaro, a roadstead about nineteen miles eastward of Berberah.|$|R
50|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 19th century and the early 20th century, the area was used by the local miners who <b>sank</b> <b>pits</b> to extract coal. This 'coal getting' was done {{extensively}} during the miners' strike in 1921. These pits were later capped by the National Coal Board to leave 16 acre of land being sold in 1932 for the sum of £500 to be re-developed as a park. Much of the landscaping of the park to the form that can be seen today was organised by the Miner's Institute Committee, the first sod being cut in June 1932 and the work being carried out by 50 local volunteers along with International Students.|$|R

60|$|Bull and Ryan both {{agreed with}} Terence and, at daybreak the next morning, the half {{battalion}} marched out, relieved the Portuguese troops holding the two redoubts, and established themselves there. They {{had brought with}} them a number of intrenching tools, and were accompanied by an engineer officer. So, {{as soon as they}} reached the redoubts, several parties of men were set to work, to begin to <b>sink</b> <b>pits</b> for driving galleries {{in the direction of the}} approaches that the French were pushing forward; while others assisted a party of artillerymen to work the guns. Some of the best shots in the corps took their places on the rampart, and were directed to maintain a steady fire on the French working parties.|$|R
50|$|Costeaning is {{the process}} by which miners seek to {{discover}} metallic lodes.

50|$|Bedford Park, on the {{northern}} outskirts of Cefn Cribwr, is now an area of 40 acre of ancient woodland and meadows, glades and open spaces. It was once an area of intense industrial activity after the Birmingham industrialist John Bedford built a blast furnace here in 1780. He also <b>sank</b> <b>pits</b> to mine the raw materials of ironstone and coal as well as founding a forge and brickworks. The ironworks were never as successful as Bedford had hoped, and began to decline {{after his death in}} 1791. Coal mining and brick making, however, continued throughout the 19th century, but industrial activity at Bedford Park ceased after World War I. The ironworks are now protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument — one of the most complete of its kind in Britain. Many parts of the ironworks and related buildings can still be seen.|$|R
50|$|In 1828, Foster {{acquired}} the Madeley Court estate. Here he commenced mining operations, <b>sinking</b> 17 <b>pits</b> in total. Later (in 1843), Foster had blast furnaces constructed nearby. In 1833, Foster acquired a lease of Stourton Castle for £10,000. He subsequently modernised {{and added to}} the building, employing the architect Sir Robert Smirke to provide the designs.|$|R
5000|$|In 1853, Sam and Joseph Thomas began <b>sinking</b> a <b>pit</b> shaft {{within the}} remote farming {{community}} {{at the top}} of the Dare Valley.

50|$|In 1806, {{two miles}} to the east of Harthill at Greenrigg, Lord Polkemmet <b>sank</b> a <b>pit</b> which {{employed}} thirteen miners, two boys and some labourers. The seam was about 25 m below ground and it produced 8,000 tons of coal per year, which was sold for 6 shillings and 4d (33 new pence) per ton into Edinburgh and generated annual revenues of around £1,000 per year.|$|R
50|$|Work {{restarted}} in 1919, {{six months}} later {{it was reported that}} the water ingress had practically stopped and the resulting work was up to standard. However the issues when <b>sinking</b> the <b>pit</b> prior to the Annual General Meeting of 1920 resulted in more delays and at this meeting the proprietors were informed it would take another three to four years to finish sinking operations.|$|R

40|$|Autologous split {{thickness}} miniature punch {{skin grafting}} {{is one of}} the surgical modes of treatment of stable vitiligo. Out of 87 different sites, of stable vitiligo, occurring in 62 cases, (32 focal, 22 segmental and 8 generalised) 75 sites showed total repigmentation with excellent cosmetic colour match. Out of the 62 cases, 46 cases who were treated postsurgically with PUVA therapy repigmented within 2 &#x 00 BD; to 3 months, 10 cases, who received no treatment postsurgically repigmented by 3 &#x 00 BD; to 6 months. In addition 6 cases in whom no treatment was given postsurgically had to be given PUVA therapy 3 months after surgery as there was poor repigmentation. The complications seen were graft rejection due to improper immobilization in 6 cases, graft rejection due to secondary infection in 1, contact allergic dermatitis to framycetin in 3, and reactivation of vitiligo in 2. Side effects seen were cobblestoning in 32, <b>sinking</b> <b>pits</b> in 12, variegated appearance in 4, and superficial scarring at donor site in all 62 cases...|$|R
40|$|In an arid climate, pit lake {{evaporation}} rates can exceed influx rates, {{causing the}} lake {{to function as a}} hydraulic terminal sink, with water levels in the pit remaining below surrounding groundwater levels. We present case studies from Western Australia for two mines nearing closure. At the first site, modelling indicates that waste dump covers for the potentially acid forming (PAF) material would not be successful over the long term (1, 000 years or more). The second site is a case study where PAF management is limited by the current waste rock dump location and suitable cover materials. Pit lake water balance modelling using Goldsim software indicated that both pit lakes would function as hydraulic terminal sinks if not backfilled above long-term equilibrium water levels. Poor water quality will likely develop as evapoconcentration increases contaminant concentrations, providing a potential threat to local wildlife. Even so, the best current opportunity to limit the risk of contaminant migration and protect regional groundwater environments may be to limit backfill and intentionally produce a terminal <b>sink</b> <b>pit</b> lake...|$|R
60|$|But the natives, as {{has been}} shown, can also work quartz, an art well known to the Ancient Egyptians. They either pick up {{detached}} pieces showing visible gold, or they <b>sink</b> <b>pits</b> and nibble at {{the walls of the}} reefs. But whereas the Nile-peoples pounded the stone in mortars and washed the dust on sloping boards, here the matrix must be laboriously levigated. A handful of broken quartz is placed upon the 'cankey-stone,' with which the gudewife grinds her 'mealies.' It is a slightly hollowed slab of granite or hard conglomerate, some two feet square, sloping away from the worker, and standing upon a rude tripod of tree-branches secured by a lashing of 'tie-tie.' The stuff is then rubbed with a hand-stone not unlike a baker's roll, and a slight deviation is given to it as it moves 'fore and aft.' The reduced stone is caught in a calabash placed {{at the lower end of}} the slab. This is usually night-work, and all the dark hours will be wasted in grinding down a cubic foot of stone.|$|R
50|$|In 1866 {{work began}} <b>sinking</b> a <b>pit</b> {{at the foot}} of the hill that began {{producing}} coal in 1869, and was then known as Boldon New Winning. The village that developed nearby in the 1870s became known as Boldon Colliery. When the mine was deepened and extended in the 1910s, further housing to accommodate the workforce was built to the south of the pit in an area known as Boldon New Town.|$|R
50|$|The Westminster and United Collieries Group {{began to}} <b>sink</b> the <b>pit</b> at Gresford in 1908. Two shafts were sunk 50 yd apart: the Dennis (named after the {{industrialist}} Dennis family of Ruabon {{who were the}} pit owners) and the Martin. Work was completed in 1911. The mine {{was one of the}} deepest in the Denbighshire Coalfield: the Dennis shaft reached depths of about 2264 ft and the Martin shaft about 2252 ft.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1840s, John Darlington leased {{the mineral}} rights of land {{belonging}} to Astley Hall and <b>sank</b> a <b>pit,</b> Astley Colliery, which subsequently became {{the site of}} Gin Pit Colliery.

60|$|Presently I {{arrived at}} the village of Abosu, a walk of about two hours from the Tákwá mine. Ten months ago it {{contained}} forty to fifty head of negroes; now it may number 3,000, although the May emigration had begun, when the workmen return to their homes, being unable to labour in the flooded flats. There was the hum of a busy, buzzing crowd, <b>sinking</b> <b>pits</b> and shafts, some in the very streets and outside their own doors. This alluvial bed {{must be one of}} the richest in the country; and it is wholly native property under King Angu, of Apinto. There is little to describe in the village; every hut is a kind of store, where the most poisonous of intoxicants, the stinkingest of pomatum, and the gaudiest of pocket-handkerchiefs are offered as the prizes for striking gold. There are also a few goldsmiths' shops, where the precious metal is adulterated and converted to coarse, rude ornaments. The people are able 'fences,' and powder, fuses, and mining-tools easily melt into strong waters. Hence Abosu is a Paradise to the Fanti police and to the Haussa garrison of Tákwá.|$|R
2500|$|In 1864 they leased the Garth land, <b>sank</b> the Garth <b>pit</b> and erected coke-ovens, {{which they}} worked until the {{depression}} in 1877 forced their closure. Richards (1982) says (re Garth Colliery, 1864), [...] "J. Brogden & Sons bought Garth Fach and Cwmdu Canol Farms and <b>sank</b> this <b>pit</b> in 1865. The sinking operations were supervised by James Barrow, who was later President of the South Wales Institute of Engineers. He was also mineral agent to the Margam Estate. In 1867 {{there was an}} explosion but no-one was hurt. It resulted in the closure of the colliery for a year. About 1880 the pit was idle for another year but in 1882 it was sunk to a depth of 250yards, 3 seams being worked. In addition there were 60 coke ovens producing 1,000tons of coke weekly. It was after the sinking of Oakwood and Garth Pits that the village of Garth developed. Garth Pit closed in 1930 when it employed 616 men.".|$|R

40|$|Pit lakes may {{form when}} open cut mining {{operations}} extend below groundwater level and then fill at cessation of mining and associated dewatering operations by ground and surface water influx. Pit lake hydrogeology may {{function as an}} evaporative “sink” when pit lake water evaporation rates exceed influx rates. Although not ideal closure, management of local surface and groundwaters contaminated by Acid and Metalliferous Drainage (AMD) through entrainment toward an evaporative terminal pit lake may provide a best-case scenario for protection of regional water resources required by typical mine closure time scales of hundreds to thousands of years. We present two case studies from Western Australia; the first where closure of above ground landforms such as waste dumps by covers would arguably not be successful over long terms (1, 000 years or more) and another where Potentially Acid Forming waste (PAF) management is limited by current waste rock dump location and suitable cover materials. Pit lake water balance modelling indicates both case study pit lakes will function as hydraulic sinks {{if they are not}} backfilled above their equilibrium water levels. A best closure outcome for these pit lakes may be to be backfilled with PAF encapsulated with alkaline/neutral waste and then filled as rapidly as possible to minimise PAF oxidation and ensure an evaporative <b>sink</b> <b>pit</b> lake is formed...|$|R
50|$|In 1225 Henry III gave {{every man}} {{the right to}} <b>sink</b> a marl <b>pit</b> on his own land. Spreading chalk on the fields was a common {{practice}} in the Middle Ages.

50|$|During {{this period}} {{it was evident}} that further mineral {{extraction}} was developing, and a special meeting of shareholders on 5 February 1872 approved the submission of a Bill to extend the line to Glencorse and Mauricewood. The Shotts Iron Company had promised to send 50,000 to 60,000 tons of ironstone annually on the branch and the Glasgow Iron Company was <b>sinking</b> new <b>pits</b> in the district. The Glencorse Extension Act was passed on 5 August 1872 with capital of £36,000. The Shotts Iron Company pit at Mauricewood was on high ground and was reached from the railway branch by a tramway on an inclined plane.|$|R
50|$|This {{led to an}} impasse, and {{the line}} was not used; the {{situation}} remained until the Dowlais Iron Company was <b>sinking</b> new <b>pits</b> at Aberdare Junction (Abercynon) and desired to send construction materials there from Dowlais. The GWR conveyed them to Llancaiach and the TVR took them on from there from November 1889, the first regular use of the Llancaiach branch for 19 years. From 1890 some traffic was brought down from the Llancaiach colliery, {{on the north side}} of the line; the TVR had to pay the GWR a toll to cross the Taff Vale Extension line. The volume of traffic was not great.|$|R
6000|$|At last we <b>sank</b> a <b>pit</b> {{some five}} feet {{deep in a}} {{re-entering}} angle of the northern or smaller branch; we lined it with stone down-stream, where the flow made the loose sand fall in, and we obtained an ample and excellent supply. Doubtless it was spoiled, as soon as our backs were turned, by the half-Fellah Jeráfín-Huwaytát, to whom the place belongs. The sea-breeze during the day was high and dust-laden, but we passed a cool delicious night upon the clean sweet sand, which does not stick or cling. At this altitude there is no fear of bugs and fleas--the only dread is Signor [...] "Pediculus." ...|$|R
