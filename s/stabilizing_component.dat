As in other plant tissues, B is needed for the maintenance of nodule cell wall structure. Moreover, several symbiotic events including rhizobial infection, nodule cell invasion and symbiosome development that involve membrane related functions (i. e., vesicle targeting, secretion, or cell surface interactions) are affected by B deficiency. Using anti-rhamnogalacturonan II (anti-RGII) antiserum and immunological techniques, we recently described membrane glycoproteins (RGII-glycoproteins) developmentally regulated in Pisum sativum nodules, which are not detected by the antibody in B-deficient nodules. RGII-glycoproteins appeared related with development processes involving extensive membrane synthesis, like symbiosome maturation or cell growth, both of them negatively affected by B deficiency.

We identified HCA 66, a protein that localizes to the centrosome from S-phase to mitosis and to the nucleolus throughout interphase. Silencing of HCA 66 expression resulted in failure of centrosome duplication and in the formation of monopolar spindles, reminiscent of the phenotype observed after γ-tubulin silencing. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that proteins of the γ-tubulin ring complex were absent from the centrosome in these monopolar spindles. Immunoblotting revealed reduced protein levels of all components of the γ-tubulin small complex (γ-tubulin, GCP 2, and GCP 3) in HCA 66 -depleted cells.

In fact, careful structural interpretation by ChemSpider and PubChem databases of empirical formulae obtained from Orbitrap mass spectra revealed that organosoluble fractions of both soils were dominated by aliphatic AD and saccharide ET, while aromatic AD, HN and saccharide ET were predominant in the hydrosoluble fractions. Hence, saccharide ET was found to be the class of compounds common in all types of fractions in both soils, although these components were bound to aromatic moieties in the hydrosoluble fractions. Therefore, these findings indicate that saccharide ET compounds, such as flavanon glycosides, are recalcitrant in grassland soils and represent a <b>stabilized</b> <b>component</b> of SOM.|$|R

We investigated the cerebrovascular transport of human SAP in animal experiments and in culture blood-brain barrier (BBB) models. After intravenous injection, no SAP could be detected by immunohistochemistry or ELISA in healthy rat brains. Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide injection increased BBB permeability for SAP and the number of cerebral vessels labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -SAP in mice. Furthermore, when SAP was injected to the rat hippocampus, a time-dependent decrease in brain concentration was seen demonstrating a rapid SAP efflux transport in vivo. A temperature-dependent bidirectional transport of FITC-SAP was observed in rat brain endothelial monolayers. The permeability coefficient for FITC-SAP was significantly higher in abluminal to luminal (brain to blood) than in the opposite direction. The luminal release of FITC-SAP from loaded endothelial cells was also significantly higher than the abluminal one. Our data indicate the presence of BBB efflux transport mechanisms protecting the brain from SAP penetration.

Survival {{probability}} depends on gall size; in small galls the larva is vulnerable to parasitoid oviposi-tion, whereas larvae in large galls are more frequently eaten by avian predators. Fly populations from 20 natural old fields in central Pennsylvania were monitored in 1983 and 1984 to examine {{the distribution of the}} selection intensity imposed by natural enemies, the parasitoids Eurytoma gi-gantea and E. obtusiventris, the inquiline Mordellistena un-icolor, and the predatory birds Dendrocopus pubescens and Parus atricapillus. Mordellistena and E. obtusiventris are able to attack galls of all diameters while E. gigantea and the predatory birds preferentially assaulted small and large diameter galls, respectively. Eurosta in intermediate sized galls had the highest survivorship, hence selection had a <b>stabilizing</b> <b>component.</b> However, parasitoid attack was more frequent than bird attack, and the two did not exactly balance, thus there was also a directional component.

40|$|AbstractThe {{testing of}} {{assemblies}} {{for use in}} cryogenic systems commonly includes evaluation at or near operating (therefore cryogenic) temperature. Typical assemblies include valves and pumps for use in liquid oxygen-liquid hydrogen rocket engines. One frequently specified method of cryogenic external leakage testing requires the assembly, pressurized with gaseous helium (GHe), be immersed in a bath of liquid nitrogen (LN 2) and allowed to thermally <b>stabilize.</b> <b>Component</b> interfaces are then visually inspected for leakage (bubbles). Unfortunately the liquid nitrogen will be boiling under normal, bench-top, test conditions. This boiling tends to mask even significant leakage. One little known and perhaps under-utilized property of helium is the seemingly counter-intuitive thermodynamic property that when ambient temperature helium is bubbled through boiling LN 2 at a temperature of − 195. 8 °C, {{the temperature of the}} liquid nitrogen will reduce. This paper reports on the design and testing of a novel proof-of-concept helium injection control system confirming {{that it is possible to}} reduce the temperature of an LN 2 bath below boiling point through the controlled injection of ambient temperature gaseous helium and then to efficiently maintain a reduced helium flow rate to maintain a stabilized liquid temperature, enabling clear visual observation of components immersed within the LN 2.

Specifically, our recent studies have {{provided}} evidence that the reduction of E-cadherin N-glycosylation promoted the recruitment of <b>stabilizing</b> <b>components,</b> vinculin and serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A), to adherens junctions (AJs) and enhanced the association of AJs with the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we examined the details of how N-glycosylation of E-cadherin affected the molecular organization of AJs and their cytoskeletal interactions. Using the hypoglycosylated E-cadherin variant, V 13, we show that V 13 /β-catenin complexes preferentially interacted with PP 2 A and with the microtubule motor protein dynein. This correlated with dephosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau, suggesting that increased association of PP 2 A with V 13 -containing AJs promoted their tethering to microtubules. On the other hand V 13 /γ-catenin complexes associated more with vinculin, suggesting that they mediated the interaction of AJs with the actin cytoskeleton. N-glycosylation driven changes in the molecular organization of AJs were physiologically significant because transfection of V 13 into A 253 cancer cells, lacking both mature AJs and tight junctions (TJs), promoted the formation of stable AJs and enhanced the function of TJs {{to a greater extent than}} wild-type E-cadherin. These studies provide the first mechanistic insights into how N-glycosylation of E-cadherin drives changes in AJ composition through the assembly of distinct β-catenin- and γ-catenin-containing scaffolds that impact the interaction with different cytoskeletal components...|$|R

To explore these relationships the chemical composition of EPS from Bacillus subtilis NCIB 3610 biofilms grown in sucrose-rich (SYM) and sucrose-poor (MSgg and Czapek) media was studied. We observed marked differences in composition of EPS polymers isolated from all three biofilms or from spent media below the biofilms. The polysaccharide levan dominated the EPS of SYM grown biofilms, while EPS from biofilms grown in sucrose-poor media contained significant amounts of proteins and DNA in addition to polysaccharides. The EPS polymers differed also in size with very large polymers (Mw. 2000 kDa) found only in biofilms, while small polymers (Mw, 200 kD) dominated in the EPS isolated from spent media. Biofilms of the eps knockout were significantly thinner {{than those of the}} tasA knockout in all media. The biofilm defective phenotypes of tasA and eps mutants were, however, partially compensated in the sucrose-rich SYM medium. Sucrose supplementation of Czapek and MSgg media increased the thickness and stability of biofilms compared to non-supplemented controls.

There was a response rate to TNF of 100 % among 37 control subjects whose leukocytes were tested in parallel. NR serum contained an activity that inhibited the cytotoxic function of TNF- and GM-CSF-stimulated normal human eosinophils. A similar activity was detected in 4 of 122 control sera and in sera of two subjects with hypereosinophilia. This activity (ECI) had an apparent molecular weight of 80, 000 - 100, 000 and was sensitive to heating at 80 degrees C or to trypsin treatment. HPLC sizing chromatography increased the titer of ECI by a factor of 50 to 2, 000 in experiments using NR serum or other sera with detectable inhibitory activity. In seven experiments using sera with no inhibitory activity, HPLC generated ECI of the same apparent molecular weight. The effect of HPLC on ECI activity required the separation of serum components and did not result from exposure to HPLC system components or other sample processing methods. This suggests that ECI in serum can be stabilized in an inactive or partially active form and that HPLC removes the <b>stabilizing</b> <b>component.</b> ECI suppressed TNF-stimulated eosinophil cytotoxic function when added to cultures up to 4 h after exposure of eosinophils to cytokine. However, ECI did not protect L 929 cells from the toxic effects of TNF. Thus, ECI did not act by preventing the initial interaction of TNF with eosinophils or by interfering with the binding of TNF to its receptor on L 929 cells. The results suggest that ECI is a component of a feedback mechanism that suppresses functions of cytokine-activated eosinophils in inflammation...|$|E

Etioplasts have been isolated in 16 different plant species (broad bean, pea, bean, mustard, kale, radish, cucumber, pumpkin, sunflower, castor bean, soybean, crupina, barley, maize, oat and wheat). All isolated etioplasts have been carefully observed by microscopic methods, especially by phase-contrast microscopy. In 5 plant species (pea, radish, sunflower, pumpkin and maize) the etioplasts have been investigated in detail with electron microscope. Depending on plant species the isolation of etioplasts has been attempted in different media, designated as medium A, B, C and D. The basic medium — medium A — corresponds to a slightly modified medium as used by Jacobson (1968). The following results have been obtained: Pea, broad bean, pumkin, sunflower, cucumber, crupina, radish, mustard, and all cereals have proved to be suitable plants for etioplast isolation, while bean, castor bean, soybean and kale {{have been shown to be}} unsuitable. The highest number of isolated etioplasts (Table 1) can be obtained from the etiolated leaves of pea, and the lowest one from the cotyledon of sunflower. The size distribution of the etioplasts varies in different plants (Hist. 1 — 5) and ranges from 2 — 2. 5 ¡xm in radish, 2. 5 — 3 ¡Jim in pea, pumpkin and maize, and 3 — 3, 5 pm in sunflower. The composition of the medium proved to be an important factor in the etioplast isolation. In most plants etioplasts can be successfully isolated in the medium A (see p. 71 and Figs. 1, 6); this medium, however, is less suitable for the isolation of etioplasts in broad bean (Fig. 3), radish (Fig. 8), and sunflower (Figs. 2, 7), and unsuitable in pea (Fig. 4).

The regulating activity of EMAP II was also observed for MARP (anti-Methyltransferase Antibody Recognizable Protein). IFN-α 2 b and Laferon-PharmBiotek with the activity of 200 and 2000 IU/ml were shown to cause an increase of the MGMT protein amount in Hep- 2 cells. Conclusions. The purified recombinant proteins EMAP II and IFN-α 2 b which are substrates for the medicinal preparations influenced on the amount of MGMT protein in the human cell cultures in a concentration-dependent manner. At the same time {{the effect of}} medicinal preparations differs from that of the purified protein IFN-α 2 b. Possibly it depends on the presence of <b>stabilizing</b> <b>components</b> in their compositions...|$|R
40|$|The {{viscosity}} of {{an optical}} fibre over 1000 - 1150 C is studied by inscribing an optical fibre Bragg grating that can withstand temperatures up to 1200 C and monitoring fibre elongation under load through the Bragg wavelength shift. This optical interrogation offers high {{accuracy and reliability}} compared with direct measurements of elongation, particularly at lower temperatures, thus avoiding significant experimental error. An excellent Arrhenius fit is obtained from which an activation energy for viscous flow of Ea = 450 kJ mol - 1 is extracted; addition of an additional temperature-dependent pre-exponential does not change this value. The log plot of viscosity is found overall {{to be consistent with}} that reported in the literature for silica measurements on rods and beams, but substantially higher than past work reported for optical fibres. The annealing and strain temperatures for an optical fibre were derived as 1114 C and 1010 C. However, it is shown that, because regenerated gratings already involve a post-annealing process at higher temperature, the structures are equilibrated and much more relaxed compared with normal fibres, making viscosity measurements meaningful. This work highlights the need to <b>stabilize</b> <b>components</b> for operation in harsh environments before their application, despite some mechanical compromise. Given the increasing expectation of all-optical waveguide technologies operating > 1000 C, the need to study the behaviour of glass over the long term brings added significance to the basic understanding of glass in this regime.

40|$|The apical {{surface of}} the toad urinary bladder is covered by an {{interconnected}} mesh of glycocalyx, which appears to attach to the plasma membrane bilayer. To evaluate the interrelationship between these extracellular elements and intramembrane structures, a strategy was devised to produce composite replicas that allow the simultaneous visualization of intramembrane particles by freeze-fracture while the glycocalyx mesh is replicated by rotary shadowing of the extracellular surface after freeze-drying. Evaluation of these composite replicas by electron microscopy reveals that contacts occur between extracellular filamentous elements and intramembrane particles. This structural organization may be important for <b>stabilizing</b> intramembrane <b>components</b> and for anchoring extracellular elements to the membrane...|$|R
