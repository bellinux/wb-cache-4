40|$|Advanced <b>SCOOP</b> 1 aspects play an {{important}} role in <b>SCOOP</b> projects. To support a full fledged <b>SCOOP</b> implementation we have to make sure that advanced <b>SCOOP</b> aspects are processed and translated correctly. The translation is done from <b>SCOOP</b> code which is processed and transformed into Eiffel code by running it through the <b>SCOOP</b> compiler. In order for <b>SCOOP</b> to be able and understand those advanced aspects we have to enrich the <b>SCOOP</b> compiler to know how to deal with those aspects while processing the <b>SCOOP</b> code. Modern <b>SCOOP</b> projects can include feature redeclaration involving separate and non-separate types. Cases of feature redeclaration including separate and non-separate types which are allowed under the <b>SCOOP</b> conformance rules fail being processed by the current <b>SCOOP</b> implementation 2. The solution is to simulate that no redeclaration was done on the feature signature while adapting the internal use of the changed type in the Eiffel code which was processed and translated from the <b>SCOOP</b> code. As well as feature redeclaration, casting is {{an important}} advanced aspec...|$|R

5|$|Despite a shaky {{start at}} the anchor desk, Jennings' {{broadcast}} began to climb in the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch. When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of Tom Brokaw and NBC News. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by <b>scooping</b> the other networks with news {{of the fall of}} the Berlin Wall. It was World News Tonight, however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks of the year in first place, and its average ratings for the entire year beat CBS for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Eva {{finds herself}} growing fonder of Albert {{and they have}} lunch with his teenage {{daughter}}, Tess, who, like Eva's daughter Ellen, is {{graduating from high school}} and moving away to attend college. A few days later, Eva goes to her massage appointment with Marianne and realizes that Albert is Marianne's ex-husband after Marianne tells a story about how he manages to pick out onions when <b>scooping</b> salsa â€” the same story Albert had told Eva, but about guacamole. Tess then arrives at the house and Eva's suspicions are confirmed. Marianne tries to introduce Eva to Tess, but Eva hides behind a tree to avoid the meeting. Eva continues seeing Albert, keeping her friendship with Marianne a secret; likewise, she does not tell Marianne that she is seeing him.|$|E
5|$|Pita {{bread is}} a {{double-layered}} flat or pocket bread traditional in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is baked plain, {{or with a}} topping of sesame or nigella seeds or za'atar. Pita is used in multiple ways, such as stuffed with falafel, salads or various meats as a snack or fast food meal; packed with schnitzel, salad and French fries for lunch; filled with chocolate spread as a snack for schoolchildren; or broken into pieces for <b>scooping</b> up hummus, eggplant and other dips. A lafa is larger, soft flatbread that is rolled up with a falafel or shawarma filling. Various ethnic groups continue to bake traditional flat breads. Jews from the former Soviet republic of Georgia make the flatbread, lavash.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{assessed the}} consumer {{acceptance of a}} recycled paper <b>scoop</b> versus the existing polystyrene (PS) <b>scoop</b> as a dosing device for synthetic powder laundry detergents. Specifically: (1) Were the consumers aware of and {{in agreement with the}} environmental benefits of a recycled paper <b>scoop</b> versus the current plastic <b>scoop?</b> (2) Did consumers consider a recycled paper <b>scoop</b> as an acceptable replacement for the current plastic measuring <b>scoop?</b> The implementation of a recycled paper <b>scoop</b> would reduce packaging waste by approximately 20 % by weight and a significant source reduction through decreased consumption of raw materials. Additionally, it would provide a substantial cost savings of approximately $ 30 M USD annually. The recycled paper <b>scoop</b> consisted of 50 % of post industrial (external) recycled fibres, 40 % of post consumer recycled fibres and 10 % of virgin fibres and internal waste sources. The 10 % virgin fibres and internal sources was used to help increase the board strength and improve printability. The TAPPI (1989) test methods were used in the selection of the paperboard grades in meeting the performance requirements of the paper <b>scoop</b> application. The results of the home performance test indicated that a recycled paper measuring <b>scoop</b> was not an acceptable replacement for the plastic measuring <b>scoop.</b> Although there were positive ratings on the recycled paper <b>scoop,</b> they related to generalities and environmental preference. The recycled paper measuring <b>scoop</b> cannot substitute several aspects of the plastic <b>scoop,</b> specifically, the technical functionality, durability, rigidity and utility...|$|R

5|$|The cuisine of the Galilee is {{very similar}} to Lebanese cuisine, due to the {{extensive}} communication between the two regions before the establishment of Israel. The Galilee specializes in a number of meals based on the combination of bulgur, spices and meat, known as kubbi by Arabs. Kubbi bi-siniyee is a combination of minced lamb or beef mixed with pepper, allspice and other spices wrapped in a bulgur crust, then baked. Kubbi bi-siniyee could serve as the main dish during a Palestinian lunch. Kubbi neyee is a variation of kubbi, that is served as raw meat mixed with bulgur and a variety of spices. It is mostly eaten as a side dish and pita or markook bread is used for <b>scooping</b> the meat. Since the dish is raw, whatever is not eaten is cooked the next day in either the baked version or as fried kibbee balls.|$|E

40|$|<b>SCOOP</b> is {{a minimal}} {{extension}} to the sequential object-oriented programming model for concurrency. The extension consists of one keyword (separate) that avoids explicit thread declarations, synchronized blocks, explicit waits, and eliminates data races and atomicity violations by construction, through {{a set of}} compiler rules. <b>SCOOP</b> was originally described for the Eiffel programming language. This paper makes two contributions. Firstly, it presents a design pattern for <b>SCOOP,</b> which makes it feasible to transfer <b>SCOOPâ€™s</b> concepts to different object-oriented programming lan-guages. Secondly, it demonstrates the generality of the <b>SCOOP</b> model by presenting an implementation of the <b>SCOOP</b> design pattern for Java. Additionally, we describe tools that support the <b>SCOOP</b> design pattern, and give a concrete example of its use in Java...|$|R

50|$|<b>Scoops</b> are {{important}} and likely to interest or concern many people. A <b>scoop</b> is typically a new story, or a new aspect to an existing or breaking news story. Generally the story is unexpected, or surprising, or formerly secret, so the <b>scoop</b> typically comes from an exclusive source. Events witnessed by many people generally cannot become <b>scoops,</b> (e.g., a natural disaster, or the announcement at a press conference). However, exclusive news content {{is not always a}} <b>scoop,</b> as it may not provide the requisite importance or excitement. A <b>scoop</b> may be also defined retrospectively; a story may {{come to be known as}} a <b>scoop</b> because of a historical change in perspective of a particular event. Due to their secret nature, scandals are a prime source of <b>scoops</b> (e.g., the Watergate scandal by Washington Post journalists Woodward and Bernstein).|$|R

50|$|Snow shovels {{designed}} for lifting snow generally have smaller <b>scoops</b> than snow shovels {{designed for}} throwing snow. A typical push-type shovel <b>scoop</b> {{would be about}} 24 inches across with a wide, blunt blade, while a lift-type shovel <b>scoop</b> may be half that size. A narrower <b>scoop</b> makes the removal of deep, wet, or heavy snow easier. <b>Scoops</b> with a large curve can carry more snow, while those with a shallow curve are intended to push snow rather than carry it. Metal <b>scoops</b> are studier than plastic but heavier, and they also require more maintenance. Steel and steel-edged <b>scoops</b> are heavier than aluminum or plastic, but are also more durable. Although they are very good for dealing with ice, they can also damage delicate outdoor home surfaces.|$|R
