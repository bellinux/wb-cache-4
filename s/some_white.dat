5|$|A turn-of-the-20th-century {{apartment}} construction boom {{allowed the}} expansion of Chicago's African American ghetto southward, and the original inhabitants mostly left the area. The transition was rapid and marked with conflicts such as the Race Riot of 1919. <b>Some</b> <b>white</b> Protestants left to form an exclusive residential community in the South Shore community area. In 1906 they formed the South Shore Country Club, which excluded Blacks and Jews from membership.|$|E
5|$|Others, {{such as the}} Traditionalist Youth Network, have praised The Daily Stormer for {{its reach}} and influence. Anglin's extreme tone has led <b>some</b> <b>white</b> nationalists to suspect {{that he is an}} {{undercover}} Jew, an accusation he finds analogous to believing that Jewish LGBT activist Allen Ginsberg was an undercover Nazi.|$|E

While <b>some</b> <b>white</b> {{nationalist}} authors have praised The Daily Stormers reach, others have taken issue with its content and tone, accusing Anglin of being an agent provocateur, used to discredit true white nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Kevin's code is {{revealed}} {{to be part of}} a Defense Department satellite transmission. NSA agents ransack the Morris household, looking for any other documentation that might supposedly compromise national security. After the Morrises are taken into custody (which causes Darlene to lose her trust towards Mulder and Scully), Mulder examines the charred roof of their RV, prompting him to head to Lake Okobogee. There, the agents discover sand turned to glass and a burned tree line, indicating the presence of a massive heat source. Upon encountering <b>some</b> <b>white</b> wolves, Mulder and Scully find Greg Randall's body in a shallow grave.|$|E
5|$|Many Portuguese colonials {{were not}} typical {{settlers}} in Mozambique. While most European communities in Africa {{at the time}} - {{with the possible exception}} of Afrikaners - were established from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, <b>some</b> <b>white</b> families and institutions in those territories still administered by Portugal had been entrenched for generations. Loss of their privileged status and fears of FRELIMO reprisal resulted in an exodus of up to 200,000 white civilians at independence (in Europe they were popularly known as retornados). Cities, towns and villages saw their Portuguese names changed after independence - Lourenço Marques to Maputo, Vila Pery to Chimoio, Vila Cabral to Lichinga, or Vila Junqueiro to Gurúè.|$|E
50|$|Most Southern whites, {{angry at}} their defeat during the Civil War (1861-1865), deeply resented {{teachers}} from the North. Although she was threatened with violence and shunned by <b>some</b> <b>whites,</b> Nelson {{taught in the}} South from 1870 until 1888.|$|R

5|$|The {{predominant}} club colours {{are green}} and white, {{which have been}} used since {{the formation of the}} club in 1875. The strip typically has a green body, white sleeves and a white collar. The shorts are normally white, although green has been used in recent seasons. The socks are green, usually with <b>some</b> <b>white</b> detail. Hibs have used yellow, purple, black, white and a dark green in recent seasons for their alternate kits. In 1977, Hibs became the first club in Scotland to bear sponsorship on their shirts. This arrangement prompted television companies to threaten a boycott of Hibs games if they used the sponsored kit, which resulted in the club using an alternate kit for the first time.|$|E
5|$|This bird is glossy {{black with}} a wide fork to the tail. Adults usually have a small white spot {{at the base of}} the gape. The iris is dark brown (not crimson as in the similar ashy drongo). The sexes cannot be told apart in the field. Juveniles are {{brownish}} and may have <b>some</b> <b>white</b> barring or speckling towards the belly and vent, and can be mistaken for the white-bellied drongo. First-year birds have white tips to the feathers of the belly, while second-years have these white-tipped feathers restricted to the vent.|$|E
5|$|As {{is common}} in {{frontier}} societies, the Southern Rhodesian settler community was mostly male: {{at the time of}} the First World War, white females were outnumbered by males almost two to one. Because white women were so marriageable and cheap black labour was easily available to handle domestic duties, most female settlers did not work and spent most of their days supervising the household and family. The average white woman in the colony continued to live this kind of life during the war, in marked contrast to her British counterpart, who in many cases went to replace the male factory workers and farm labourers who went to war. In Rhodesia little of this sort occurred: there were no munitions factories, and the idea of women working down the country's mines was not considered practical. <b>Some</b> <b>white</b> farmers' wives took over management of the land in their husbands' absence, but this was quite unusual.|$|E
5000|$|After the Civil War, Pleasant {{publicly}} {{changed her}} racial designation in the City Directory from [...] "White" [...] to [...] "Black", causing a little stir among <b>some</b> <b>whites.</b> She {{began a series}} of court battles to fight laws prohibiting blacks from riding trolleys and other such abuses.|$|R

5|$|In {{the regions}} (e.g. various regions within North America) where low {{selenium}} soil levels lead to low {{concentrations in the}} plants, some animal species may be deficient unless selenium is supplemented with diet or injection. Ruminants are particularly susceptible. In general, absorption of dietary selenium is lower in ruminants than other animals, and is lower from forages than from grain. Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g., <b>some</b> <b>white</b> clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher selenium requirements, presumably because cyanide is released from the aglycone by glucosidase activity in the rumen and glutathione peroxidases is deactivated by the cyanide acting on the glutathione moiety. Neonate ruminants at risk of white muscle disease may be administered both selenium and vitamin E by injection; some of the WMD myopathies respond only to selenium, some only to vitamin E, and some to either.|$|E
5|$|Winthrop Rutherfurd died in March 1944 {{after a long}} illness. Lucy {{continued}} to meet with Roosevelt {{in the months that}} followed more frequently. In June 1944, Franklin requested of his daughter Anna, who was then managing <b>some</b> <b>White</b> House social functions and acting as hostess, that she help him arrange to meet Lucy without Eleanor's knowledge. Aware of Rutherfurd's role in her parents' early marriage, Anna was at first angry that her father had put her in such a difficult position. However, she ultimately relented and set up a meeting in Georgetown. To her surprise, Anna found that she liked Lucy immediately, and the pair became friends. There were supposedly several dinners in the White House's second floor private quarters during Roosevelt's last year which were attended by Rutherfurd in a group with Anna's presence and obvious acceptance. When Eleanor discovered shortly after FDR's death from the female cousins of Anna's role in arranging for these meetings, the relationship between Eleanor and Anna became strained and cool for some time.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{official}} retirement as {{the flag of}} South Africa, the flag was adopted by <b>some</b> <b>white</b> South Africans as being a symbol of Afrikaner heritage and history. Many South Africans still {{view it as a}} symbol of apartheid, and therefore strongly discouraged its use. Despite the negative associations, it was never banned by the Government of South Africa post-1994 and the right to display it in South Africa is protected under Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa as an expression of free speech. In the 21st century, usage of the old South African flag experienced a revival of display as a symbol by white supremacists worldwide. A particular awareness of this followed the shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina black church in 2015, as the suspect Dylann Roof had previously been pictured wearing a jacket with the flag and the flag of Rhodesia on it. This association with apartheid and racism often led to calls for the flags that were used in a historical context, to be removed from display. An example of this is Cooma, Australia, where it is flown to commemorate South African workers in the Snowy Mountains Scheme alongside the Canadian Red Ensign and other flags from 1956 when the scheme was created.|$|E

5|$|These {{developments}} led to {{the white}} community also becoming increasing radicalised. <b>Some</b> <b>whites</b> planned to attempt a coup d'état if a black majority government took power.
