(Koza had previously had exposure to interstate compacts from his work with state lottery commissions after inventing the scratch-off lottery ticket.) That year, Koza, Barry Fadem and others formed National Popular Vote, a non-profit group to promote the legislation. The group has a transpartisan advisory committee including former US Senators Jake Garn, Birch Bayh, and David Durenberger, and former Representatives John Anderson, John Buchanan, and Tom Campbell.|$|E

25|$|On March 12, 2009, 115 {{supporters}} of Abdelrazik presented {{a ticket for}} his flight to the Canadian government.

25|$|The ongoing {{involvement}} of the Canadian Forces in Afghanistan may also influence voters. Desmond Morton, a political <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> McGill University suggested that the Conservatives could be blamed for the war because they have extended the mission twice, {{despite the fact that}} it was then Liberal Leader Jean Chrétien who was Canada's prime minister when Canada's current military involvement in Afghanistan first started in 2001. Both the Conservatives and Liberals have at various times agreed to extend the mission(s) to at least 2011, so this may result in some Canadians who are strongly against Canada's ongoing involvement, who might have otherwise typically voted either Liberal or Conservative in the past, to take their votes elsewhere in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Diệm {{applied for}} {{permission}} to travel to Rome for the Holy Year celebrations at the Vatican. After gaining French permission, he left in August 1950 with his older brother, Bishop Ngô Đình Thục. Before going to Europe, Diệm went to Japan, where he met with Prince Cường Để, his former ally, and discussed Cường Để's efforts to return to Vietnam and his capacity to play some roles in his homeland. Diệm's friend also managed to organize a meeting between him and Wesley Fishel, an American political <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> University of California who was working for CIA in Japan. Fishel was a proponent of the anti-colonial, anti-communist third force doctrine in Asia and was impressed with Diệm and helped him organize connections in the United States. In 1951, Diệm flew to the United States to seek the support of government officials. Nevertheless, Diệm was not successful in winning the US support for Vietnamese anti-communists. He continued on and flew to Europe.|$|E

[...] "As scientists, we publish our papers in Science and Nature, but very few people read those. Here's another way to get this message out.

500|$|Pat Buchanan, the {{conservative}} columnist who challenged President Bush in the 1992 presidential primaries, came to Ohio {{to campaign for}} McEwen, as did Vice President Dan Quayle and Oliver North. Though George H. W. Bush won the district, McEwen was narrowly defeated by Strickland {{in the general election}} on November 3. While he won 55-45 in the area he once represented, McEwen did not win in any of the counties that had once been in Miller's district, losing the unfamiliar territory 59-41. Strickland received 122,720 votes to McEwen's 119,252, a plurality of only 3,468. [...] "I think McEwen's loss was a case of bounced checks and some arrogance," [...] said Alfred Tuchfarber, a political <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> the University of Cincinnati who runs the Ohio Poll. [...] "He just had a certain personal arrogance about him that didn't go down well in a poor district." [...] Strickland said, [...] "I ran against Pat Robertson, Pat Buchanan, the National Rifle Association and Right-to-Life. They threw everything at me. I'm just so happy I beat back those guys.

500|$|Donkey Kong Jr. Math has {{received}} criticism for its qualities {{as an educational}} game. Elizabeth Sweedyk, associate computer <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> Harvey Mudd College, called Donkey Kong Jr. Math a realistic educational video game, criticizing such games as [...] "not fun." [...] 1UP.coms Kevin Gifford called it a game that children {{would never want to}} play. Fellow 1UP.com writer Jeremy Parish commented that the game shouldn't be judged on being an educational game, citing quality educational titles as The Oregon Trail and Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?. However, he noted that it should be judged for being a boring game. Ars Technica's Frank Caron compared it to other educational games, calling it [...] "no Brain Age" [...] and preferring to play Math Blaster instead. Educational video game developer Traci Lawson wondered whether the word game Bookworm would have been as well received by players when they were children; she felt that they would be intimidated by it, comparing this to how she felt when she played Donkey Kong Jr. Math. In contrast to the negative reception, Allgame's Skyler Miller called it a creative use of Donkey Kong Jr.s graphics and gameplay.|$|E
500|$|Scott Lasley, a {{political}} <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> Western Kentucky University {{and chairman of}} the Warren County Republican Party, criticized Bevin's appearance at the rally, saying, [...] "Either they were totally unvetted and unprepared for it, which says a lot about the campaign and its ability to compete at this level, or...they think that message is going to be receptive. Otherwise you don't go there." [...] On April 25, 2014, Bevin apologized for attending the event, saying [...] "I am genuinely sorry that my attendance at an event which, other than my comments, appears to have primarily involved a discussion of cockfighting, has created concern on the part of many Kentucky voters. I understand that concern. I am not and have never been a supporter of cockfighting or any other forms of animal cruelty." [...] The Daily Beast said the issue could be the [...] "nail in the coffin" [...] for Bevin's campaign, while The Washington Post wrote, [...] "On its own, the cockfighting story isn't enough to sink Bevin's campaign. But viewed {{in the context of the}} string of other distractions he's had to deal with, it reinforces the reality that his campaign is in serious need of repairs down the stretch." ...|$|E

500|$|First off, Pausch {{explained}} {{his dream of}} being in zero gravity. As a child, {{this had been a}} dream inspired by Apollo 11, and had stayed with him as an adult. When he was the computer <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> Carnegie Mellon, he learned of a program that NASA has that allows college students to go up into the air in NASA's Vomit Comet, which uses parabolic arcs to simulate the feeling of weightlessness. Faculty members were not allowed to go (Pausch called this a [...] "brick wall" [...] he faced), so he had to present himself as a web journalist, because local media was allowed on. Pausch proceeded to begin talking about his second childhood dream, playing in the National Football League. Although Pausch was never a player in the National Football League, he spoke about his childhood experiences with Pop Warner Football and how they had affected his life and taught him lessons. Pausch then moved on to his dream of publishing an article in the World Book Encyclopedia. As a child, Pausch always kept and read a World Book Encyclopedia in his home. As he progressed into a career, {{he became one of the}} leading professors in the field of virtual reality. World Book then called Pausch, interested in him writing for the encyclopedia. Currently, the article [...] "virtual reality" [...] in the World Book Encyclopedia is the one authored by Pausch.|$|E
500|$|Some legal scholars, {{opposed to}} the idea that jus soli should apply to the {{children}} of illegal aliens, have argued that the Wong Kim Ark precedent does not apply when alien parents are in the country illegally. [...] John C. Eastman, a former dean of the Chapman University School of Law, has argued that Wong Kim Ark does not entitle U.S.-born children of illegal aliens to gain automatic citizenship because, in his opinion, being subject to the jurisdiction of the United States requires a status of [...] "full and complete jurisdiction" [...] that does not apply to aliens who are in the country illegally. [...] Eastman further argues that the Wong Kim Ark decision was fundamentally flawed in the way it dealt with the concept of jurisdiction, and that the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924—which followed Wong Kim Ark—would not have been necessary if Congress had believed [...] "that the Citizenship Clause confers citizenship merely by accident of birth." [...] A similar analysis of the jurisdiction question has been proposed by Professor Peter H. Schuck of the Yale School of Law and Rogers M. Smith, political <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> Yale. According to law professor Lino Graglia of the University of Texas, even if Wong Kim Ark settled the status of children of legal residents, it did not do so for children of illegal residents; Graglia asserts that the case weighs against automatic birthright for illegal immigrants because the Court denied such citizenship for an analogous group, namely [...] "children of alien enemies, born during and within their hostile occupation". [...] Richard Posner, a judge of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, has also criticized the granting of citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, suggesting that Congress can and should act to change this policy. [...] Charles Wood, former counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on immigration, has also opposed the practice, urging (in 1999) that it be stopped as quickly as possible, either by an act of Congress or a constitutional amendment.|$|E
