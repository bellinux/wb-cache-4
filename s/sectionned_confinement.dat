40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effects of}} hooked-end steel fibre contents on the mechanical properties of high-performance concrete (HPC) and investigates the feasibility of utilizing steel fibres to simplify the complicated reinforcement detailing of critical HPC members under high shear stress. Mechanical properties of HPCs with specified compressive strength of 60 and 100 [*]MPa include the flow, air content, compressive strength, and flexural strength. The effectiveness of 1. 50 % steel fibre content on the shear behaviour of diagonally reinforced concrete coupling beam without additional transverse reinforcement was investigated to alleviate complex reinforcing details for the full <b>section</b> <b>confinement</b> of diagonal bar groups. The test results revealed the incorporation of steel fibres significantly affected the mechanical properties of the HPCs. For diagonally reinforced coupling beam (SFRCCB) without additional transverse reinforcement, the addition of 1. 5 % steel fibre content into 60 [*]MPa HPC coupling beam provides similar cracking and structural behaviours compared to those of diagonally reinforced coupling beam (CCB) with full <b>section</b> <b>confinement</b> details. However, the ductility of SFRCCB was {{less than that of}} CCB. It is recommended that both stirrups and steel fibre should be used for fully confining the diagonal bar groups of coupling beams to achieve the ductile behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{stress-strain}} {{behavior of}} concrete is necessary particularly when a member {{is subjected to}} combine bending and axial load and confinement effects should be accounted for. A unified theory for confinement of circular hollow sections is proposed herein, that can be extended {{to the case of}} solid and noncircular sections. The main aim of the model is to trace step-by-step the evolution of the three dimensional stresses in confined concrete and confining devices (i. e. FRP externally bonded jackets). The iterative model is able to estimate confinement effectiveness and to plot stress-strain relationships, which are different in the case of solid and hollow sections. Through the proposed improved model, a simplified closed form solution has been also derived to directly determine ultimate confined concrete properties and stress-strain curves. At present, theoretical results based on the proposed concrete circular hollow <b>sections</b> <b>confinement</b> model, in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data available in scientific literature, show that FRP jacketing can enhance the ultimate load and ductility significantly, also in the case of hollow concrete cross sections...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{analytical}} model of confined concrete proposed for square sections is {{extended to the}} case of rectangular ones. The new and generalized formulation, based on the elasticity theory, is developed under the key assumption that the confinement arises in plane-strain conditions.

In this procedure, as for the square confined <b>sections,</b> any active <b>confinement</b> model derived from triaxial tests on cylindrical specimens may be involved. The extended model is also suitable for evaluating the confining pressure offered by additional external strengthenings in any material, such as for example FRP wraps and/or steel jackets.

The design, fabrication and characterization of a novel triangular cross section nanobeam cavity produced in a single crystal diamond is demonstrated. The present cavity design, based on a triangular cross <b>section</b> allows vertical <b>confinement</b> and better signal collection efficiency than that of slab-based nanocavities, and eliminates the need for a pre-existing membrane. The nanobeam is fabricated by Focused-Ion-Beam (FIB) patterning. The cavity is characterized by a confocal photoluminescence. The modes display quality factors of Q ~ 220 and are deviated in wavelength by only ~ 1. 7 nm from the NV- color center zero phonon line (ZPL). The measured results are found in good agreement with 3 D Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) calculations. A more advanced cavity design with Q= 22, 000 is modeled, showing the potential for high-Q implementations using the triangular cavity design.

40|$|High-strength-concrete (HSC) is brittle, but its {{ductility}} can be {{dramatically increased}} when confined by steel tubes. However, {{the size of}} hot-rolled tubular sections is commonly limited to 600 mm, its capacity as mega columns in many high-rise buildings is inadequate. This paper details the use of fabricated and rolled sections as mega-columns by the direct analysis of design (DAM) which is further presented for application with high-strength-concrete-filled-tubular (HCFT) columns of circular and octagonal <b>sections</b> allowing for <b>confinement</b> effects in concrete. To capture the material yielding behaviors and to allow for an explicit simulation on the member initial curvatures, a curved-piecewise-Hermite (CPH) element is especially developed for simulating the behaviors of HCFT columns under extreme loading conditions. A plastic-fiber-hinge-model using the sectional strength-iteration surfaces is proposed for capturing the yielding behavior at the hinge locations and the analytical method for generating the yield surfaces is elaborated. To this, one-element-per-member is sufficient for numerical simulation; and the savings in computer time are considerable, making the proposed theory practical. The material model for the HSC in steel tubes is essential for a successful design. To this, an experiment on two groups of confined specimens, e. g. circular and octagonal, is established for investigating the properties of HSC, and an approximated calculation method is proposed and validated with the experiments. Consequently, the corresponding stress vs. strain relations of the confined HSC can be determined for use in analysis. Finally, examples are given for verifying and validating the proposed method for HCFT columns with circular and octagonal sections. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|A recent {{trend in}} bridge {{construction}} {{has been the}} optimization of the cost-to-performance ratio. The {{most effective way to}} optimize the cost-to-performance ratio is to maximize the efficiency of the superstructure. Currently, many bridge engineers and designers favor two- or three- girder plate superstructures, due to their cost advantages. However, research on the performance enhancements of the I-type girder in two- or three- girder plate bridges is lacking. One of the most important performance improvement technologies for the I-type girder is the “preflex” method. In the preflex method, the specimen is inverted during the construction process to apply prestressed cambering to the specimen by using self-weight. However, a problem with the preflex construction method is difficulty with inverting the girder/plate system during the concrete curing process. Therefore, a new inverting system called Turn-Over (TO) wheel was proposed. Using TO wheels, wider variations to the I-type girder design can be achieved. Using this TO construction method, various cross sectional designs of girder plate systems can be considered due to its easiness in inverting the girder/plate system. In this study, the location of concrete <b>confinement</b> <b>sections</b> between the steel I-beams and concrete plates was varied in an I-girder cross-sectional design. Design parameters included effective height, flange thickness, flange width, confining concrete section width, etc. From this study, the optimum cross-sectional design of the I-girder/concrete plate system was achieved. Then, a single 20 m TO girder/plate system and two 20 m TO girder bridges were constructed and tested to evaluate their performance. From the test, failure behavior, load carrying capacity, crack pattern, etc., are obtained. The results are discussed in detail in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Lateral channel {{migration}} is a naturally occurring process within meandering rivers when adjusting {{to a relatively}} stable state. Factors like stream power, soil, and streambank vegetation can influence the rate of migration along a channel. Understanding the processes controlling channel migration {{can be used to}} determine locations susceptible to nutrient and metal contaminant release and sources of suspended sediment. Many of the recent studies on bank erosion have worked at the small scale of individual sites or reaches, therefore, it is important to examine the spatial patterns and controlling processes at the watershed scale to gather new perspectives and determine the strength of relationships on a larger scale. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether migration rates have varied temporally and spatially within the Blue River watershed of southwestern Wisconsin. Furthermore, the effect of changing land use and land management practices on bank erosion were determined using historic survey data from 1830 and aerial imagery from 1940, 1968, 1995, and 2010 with geographic information science (GIS). Potential controlling factors were also determined by statistically comparing stream power and exanimating spatial links between stream power and geomorphic data. Results showed that changes in land management practices have impacted the watershed and the individual reaches within the watershed, wherein there was a general decline of migration rates within two of the reaches as land management practices improved, whereas relatively constant rates were observed within the other reaches. The individual reaches mostly experienced low migration rates within the headwater streams where valleys were narrow and underlain with resistant dolomites, either increased or were consistent throughout mid-reach locations, and generally decreased farther downstream as valleys widened in exposed friable Cambrian sandstones. Stream power was a not a strong, singular explanatory variable, however, there were several reaches where high stream power was associated with high migration rates. Changes in lithology, slope, and <b>sections</b> of channel <b>confinement</b> explain some of the spatial variability in downstream trends. These results can be used in future studies estimating suspended sediment volumes and metal contaminant release from bank erosion within the Blue River watershed. This study also provides evidence of the importance of conducting studies at the watershed scale to better understand the spatial variability of geomorphic process and therefore potentially provide more organized and time-efficient approaches to watershed management...|$|R

H 577 M CEE 2015 Zhuxxi, 172 pages :illustrations (some color); 30 cmConfining {{concrete}} columns with fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) jackets is {{now widely}} {{used as a}} strengthening method for concrete structures as it can significantly improve the compressive strength and ductility of concrete columns. Many existing {{studies have shown that}} FRP confinement is highly effective for concrete columns with a circular section but is much less effective for concrete columns with a rectangular or square <b>section.</b> The reduced <b>confinement</b> effectiveness for square/rectangular columns is due to the existence of flat sides and sharp corners in these columns. Although confinement effectiveness for these columns can be enhanced by rounding the corners, the radius of the rounded corners is limited by the existence of internal steel reinforcement. Therefore, rounding corners alone can only achieve limited improvement to the effectiveness of FRP confinement for square/rectangular columns. This thesis is concerned with a new shape modification method called the section curvilinearization method or simply the SC method. In this method, the straight sides of a square/rectangular column are modified into slightly-curved sides before FRP jacketing; the resulting columns are referred to as curvilinearized columns. Following an introductory chapter and a literature review chapter, this thesis presents the results of an MPhil research programme that included both experimental and theoretical investigations into the behaviour of FRP-confined curvilinearized concrete columns. The experimental work was undertaken to investigate the behaviour of FRP-confined curvilinearized square concrete columns under monotonic concentric compression. In particular, the effects of the significant parameters, including the rise-to-span ratio of the curved sides, the level of confinement, and the size of column, were examined. A numerical study into FRP-confined curvilinearized concrete columns is next presented. Finite element models were developed using ABAQUS based on a damaged plasticity model previously proposed by the authors' group. The finite element predictions are shown to be in close agreement with the test results. The finite element approach was then employed to investigate a number of issues that were not adequately covered by the tests. Finally, a design-oriented stress-strain model for FRP-confined concrete in curvilinearized square concrete columns was proposed for use in practical design. Based on the results and discussions presented in this thesis, it can be concluded that the SC method can significantly enhance the effectiveness of confinement as reflected by the axial stress-strain response and the compressive strength of the confined concrete, and the second-stage slope of the axial stress-axial strain curves is almost linearly related to the rise-to-span ratio. Both small-scale columns and large-scale columns were tested, and a comparison of their results indicates that the axial stress-strain relationship is little affected by column size.

The thesis is divided into a theoretical and research part. In the theoretical part of my thesis history, conditions, indications and contraindications, and also complications during a caesarean section performance are described. Information about anesthesia which is used for a caesarean section is also given. Conditions for general, epidural and spinal anesthesia administration are described. Advantages, disadvantages, indications, contraindications and complications {{of different types of}} anesthesia are also mentioned. A substantial part of the theoretical part is devoted to perioperative nursing care. The preoperative nursing care is described, the preparation for it is divided according to the type of anesthesia. Nursing care during the intraoperative and mainly postoperative phases is mentioned in detail. The aim of my thesis was to identify differences in perioperative nursing care for women with a cesarean section in regional and general anesthesia. My work was also focused on women's level of awareness about possibilities of anesthesia for caesarean section. Another goal of my work was to make up standards of perioperative nursing care for women during a caesarean section delivery in regional and general anesthesia, which is administered in the delivery room. Two hypotheses were stated. The first hypothesis is the supposition that women after a caesarean section need a different nursing care, which depends on the type of anesthesia administered. The second hypothesis is the supposition that women are adequately informed about the possibilities of anesthesia for a caesarean section. Quantitative research conducted through questionnaires was chosen to conduct the survey. Questionnaires were distributed to women after a caesarean <b>section</b> at the <b>confinement</b> department. Research results are shown in graphs. The both hypotheses were confirmed by the research investigation. The research has revealed a new finding that women need different nursing care not only after a caesarean section, but also during the intraoperative phase. I used this finding to develop a standard of perioperative nursing care for women during a caesarean section delivery in regional and general anesthesia. The standard is designed for midwives and is intended to improve nursing care for women {{in the course of a}} caesarean section delivery during the intraoperative phase. The research has proved that women with a cesarean section need a different perioperative nursing care, which depends on the type of anesthesia administered. It is therefore necessary to differentiate between the two groups and provide them with a different nursing care. The research has also shown that women feel sufficiently informed about anesthesia for a caesarean section. Women´s awareness is a prerequisite for a good cooperation with the patient and successful nursing and medical care. The nursing care provision according to the perioperative care standard will ensure a quality professional nursing care for women before, during and after a caesarean section...|$|R
