Observe that the telephone number in this example is expressed as ten (10) digits, without the country code (1) and without dashes or other <b>separator</b> <b>characters</b> when composing the email address. The country code is not needed, as the 10-digit telephone number, together with the email domain, are sufficient to send the email from any location in the world.|$|E

5000|$|Intelligent code {{completion}} works {{using an}} automatically generated in-memory database of classes, variable names, and other constructs that the application being edited defines or references. The [...] "classic" [...] implementation of IntelliSense works by detecting marker characters such as periods, or other <b>separator</b> <b>characters,</b> {{depending on the}} language. When the user types one of these characters immediately after {{the name of an}} entity having one or more accessible members (such as contained variables or functions), IntelliSense suggests matches in a pop-up window. The user can either accept the suggestion by typing a statement completion character ( [...] or [...] )—or a language-specific marker (such as the semicolon for C++), or continue typing the name. Over time, IntelliSense determines which variable or function the user most likely wants.|$|E

The {{first step was to}} model health care demand in the Solihull Primary Care Trust (PCT) (now Solihull NHS Care Trust) area as defined by GP visits, inpatient visits and outpatient visits. The next step was to make forecasts of demand based on a range of scenarios. The aim was to provide the Trust with a model that they could use to run their own bespoke demographic and lifestyle scenarios to calculate future changes demand for health services. Main Topics : The data files comprise anonymised accident and emergency, general practitioner, inpatient and outpatient data from the Solihull PCT/NHS Care Trust from 2005 - 2011. The files are CSV outputs from a database. Users should note that many of the files are in. txt format and rather than commas, the <b>separator</b> <b>characters</b> may be '|' or '^'. The large size of the data files may mean that they are not suitable for analysis in Excel or standard text editors. <br...|$|E

5000|$|Adjacent fields must be {{separated}} by a single comma. However, [...] "CSV" [...] formats vary greatly in this choice of <b>separator</b> <b>character.</b> In particular, in locales where the comma {{is used as a}} decimal separator, semicolon, TAB, or other characters are used instead.|$|R
40|$|A fiat file is the {{simplest}} possible database. It {{consists of a}} single. unformatted text file in which each line corresponds to a record. k-l occurrences of a <b>separator</b> <b>character</b> divide each record into k variable length fields; the <b>separator</b> <b>character</b> does not otherwise appear in the file. Unlike most database systems, the fiat file system is not a single. large program. Instead, it con-sists {{of a set of}} small, independent programs. called primitives. that each perform one basic operation. The user composes a sub-set of the primitives by directing the output of one to the input of the next in order to perform complex retrieval or update opera-tions. Because they arc independent, primitives are easily modified or replaced, and one can add programs to the set of prim-itives. Both the selection of primltives as well as their implementa-tion are discussed. CSD-TR- 379 - 2...|$|R

The <b>separator</b> control <b>characters</b> are not overloaded; there is no general use of them except to separate data into structured groupings.

5000|$|As {{there is}} {{currently}} no agreement on what <b>character</b> this alternative <b>separator</b> should be, there can be interoperability difficulties between different Maildir-supporting programs on these systems. However, not all Maildir-related software needs {{to know what the}} <b>separator</b> <b>character</b> is, because not all Maildir-related software {{needs to be able to}} read or modify the flags of a message ("read", [...] "replied to" [...] etc.); software that merely delivers to a Maildir, or archives old messages from it based only on date, should work no matter what separator is in use. If only the MUA needs to read or modify message flags, and only one is used, then non-standard alternative separators may be used without interoperability problems.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 5). Segmentation is {{the most}} challenging part of Bangla optical character recognition (OCR). To {{solve the problems of}} joining errors, several algorithms have been proposed in the literature, with varying degrees of accuracy. The selection of the lower modifier container units and the subsequent extraction of the modifiers from the core unit during segmentation have not been studied extensively. We present a dissection based lower modifier segmentation method which solves the problem of segmenting lower modifiers under a wide range of document images. A key goal in our methodology is to avoid over-segmentation of the units that do not actually contain any lower modifier, leading to unacceptably high error rates during segmentation. Our methodology consists of four tasks: we first identify the lower modifier <b>separator</b> line using <b>character</b> height information, and then select the primary lower modifier containers; we filter this set to eliminate the units/characters that do not actually contain any lower modifier; we then extract the lower modifier unit using the features of the core units and the lower modifiers; the final step consists of a set of empirical rules, aided by dictionary lookups, to eliminate most of the errors, resulting in an accuracy of 99. 6 %.
