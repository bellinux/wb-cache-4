The piston engine tended to overheat until electrically operated cowl flaps were installed, the catapult hooks {{had to be}} moved and the nosewheel oleo <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> had to be lengthened by 3 in. Carrier suitability tests began aboard the escort carrier [...] in early January 1945. The aircraft successfully made five catapult takeoffs using the piston engine as well as three takeoffs using both engines. No problems were reported when landing aboard the carrier. The FR-1 Fireball was further developed into the XFR-2 which utilized a 1,425 hp (1,063 kW) Wright R-1820-74W {{in place of the}} -72W. One single airframe was converted to this configuration. No prototypes were built for the next proposed variant, the FR-3, which would have used a General Electric I-20 turbojet. Both of these projects were canceled {{with the end of the}} war. The fastest Fireball was the XFR-4, which had a Westinghouse J34 turbojet and was approximately 100 mph (161 km/h) faster than the FR-1. The turbojet's air intakes were moved from the wing roots to the fuselage in front of the wing; they were covered by electrically powered doors to lessen drag when the aircraft was flying only on its piston engine. The Fireball's fuselage was lengthened by 8 in to accommodate the larger engine and the leading edge extension of the wing root that housed the air intakes was also removed. The XFR-4 was intended to serve as a testbed for the turbojet installation on the XF2R-1 Dark Shark. This was the final variant; the piston engine was replaced with a General Electric XT31-GE-2 turboprop, but only one prototype was built.|$|E

40|$|Depending on the {{different}} sink speeds, angles of attack and masses; aircraft landing gears could face {{a wide range of}} impact conditions which may possibly cause structural damage or failure. Thus, in hard landing scenarios, the landing gear must absorb sufficient energy in order to minimize dynamic stress on the aircraft airframe. Semi-active control systems are the recent potential solutions to overcome these limitations. Among semi-active control strategies, those based on smart fluids such as magneto-rheological (MR) fluids have received recent attraction as their rheological properties can be continuously controlled using magnetic or electric field and they are not sensitive to the contaminants and the temperature variation and also require lower powers. This thesis focuses on modeling of a MR damper for landing gear system and analysis of semi-active controller to attenuate dynamic load and landing impact. First, passive landing gear of a Navy aircraft is modeled and the forces associated with the <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> are formulated. The passive <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> is then integrated with a MR valve to design MR <b>shock</b> <b>strut.</b> Here, MR <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> is integrated with the landing gear system modeled as the 2 DOF system and governing equations of motion are derived in order to simulate the dynamics of the system under different impact conditions. Subsequently the inverse model of the MR <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> relating MR yield stress to the MR <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> force and strut velocity is formulated.

40|$|Aircraft {{landing gears}} are {{subjected}} {{to a wide range}} of excitation conditions with conflicting damping requirements. A novel solution to this problem is to implement semi-active damping using magnetorheological (MR) fluids. In part 1 of this contribution, a methodology was developed that enables the geometry of a flow mode MR valve to be optimized within the constraints of an existing passive landing gear. The device was designed to be optimal in terms of its impact performance, which was demonstrated using numerical simulations of the complete landing gear system. To perform the simulations, assumptions were made regarding some of the parameters used in the MR <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> model. In particular, the MR fluid's yield stress, viscosity, and bulk modulus properties were not known accurately. Therefore, the present contribution aims to validate these parameters experimentally, via the manufacture and testing of an MR <b>shock</b> <b>strut.</b> The gas exponent, which is used to model the shock strut's nonlinear stiffness, is also investigated. In general, it is shown that MR fluid property data at high shear rates are required in order to accurately predict performance prior to device manufacture.

40|$|Aircraft {{landing gears}} are {{subjected}} {{to a wide range}} of excitation conditions, which result in conflicting damping requirements. A novel solution to this problem is to implement semi-active damping using magnetorheological (MR) fluids. This paper presents a design methodology that enables an MR landing gear to be optimized, both in terms of its damping and magnetic circuit performance, whilst adhering to stringent packaging constraints. Such constraints are vital in landing gear, if MR technology is to be considered as feasible in commercial applications. The design approach focuses on the impact or landing phase of an aircraft's flight, where large variations in sink speed, angle of attack and aircraft mass makes an MR device potentially very attractive. In this study, an equivalent MR model of an existing aircraft landing gear is developed. This includes a dynamic model of an MR <b>shock</b> <b>strut,</b> which accounts for the effects of fluid compressibility. This is important in impulsive loading applications such as landing gear, as fluid compression will reduce device controllability.

40|$|In {{support of}} the QTD II (Quiet Technology Demonstrator) program, aeroacoustic {{measurements}} of a 26 %-scale, Boeing 777 main landing gear model were conducted in the Virginia Tech Stability Tunnel. The objective of these measurements was to perform risk mitigation studies on noise control devices for a flight test performed at Glasgow, Montana in 2005. The noise control devices were designed to target the primary main gear noise sources as observed in several previous tests. To accomplish this task, devices to reduce noise were built using stereo lithography for landing gear components such as the brakes, the forward cable harness, the <b>shock</b> <b>strut,</b> the door/strut gap and the lower truck. The most promising device was down selected from test results.

Computations were also made for a simply {{modified version of the}} passive gear including a series-hydraulic active control system. Comparison of computed results for the passive gear with experimental data shows that the active control landing gear analysis is valid for predicting the loads and motions of an airplane during a symmetrical landing. Computed results for the series-hydraulic active control in conjunction with the simply modified passive gear show that 20 - to 30 -percent reductions in wing force, relative to those occurring with the modified passive gear, can be obtained during the impact phase of the landing.

40|$|Due to the {{environmental}} and health concerns with Electroplated Hard Chrome (EHC), the Hard Chrome Alternatives Team (HCAT) has been working to provide an alternative wear coating for EHC. The US Navy selected Tungsten-Carbide Cobalt (WC- 17 Co) High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) thermal spray coating for this purpose and completed service evaluations on select aircraft components to support the HCAT charter in identifying an alternative wear coating for chrome plating. Other benefits of WC-Co thermal spray coatings over EHC are enhanced corrosion resistance, improved durability, and exceptional wear properties. As part of the HCAT charter and to evaluate HVOF coatings on operational Navy components, the P- 3 aircraft was selected for a service evaluation to determine the coating durability as compared to chrome plating.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{detailed}} steady and unsteady aerodynamic measurements of a Gulfstream G 550 nose landing gear model. The quarter-scale, high-fidelity model includes part of the lower fuselage and the gear cavity. The full model configuration allowed for removal of various gear components (e. g. light cluster, steering mechanism, hydraulic lines, etc.) in order to document their effects on the local flow field. The measurements were conducted at a Reynolds number of 7. 3 ! 104 based on the <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> (piston) diameter and a freestream Mach number of 0. 166. Additional data were also collected at lower Mach numbers of 0. 12 and 0. 145 and correspondingly lower Reynolds numbers. The boundary layer on the piston was tripped to enable turbulent flow separation, so as to better mimic the conditions encountered during flight. Steady surface pressures were gathered from an extensive number of static ports on the wheels, door, fuselage, and within the gear cavity. To better understand the resultant flow interactions between gear components, surface pressure fluctuations were collected via sixteen dynamic pressure sensors strategically placed on various sub-components of the gear. Fifteen of the transducers were flush mounted on the gear surface at fixed locations, while the remaining one was a mobile transducer that could be placed at numerous varying locations. The measured surface pressure spectra are mainly broadband in nature, lacking any local peaks associated with coherent vortex shedding. This finding is in agreement with off-surface flow measurements using PIV that revealed the flow field to be a collection of separated shear layers without any dominant vortex shedding processes...|$|E
40|$|Magnetorheological (MR) fluids {{enable the}} rapid and {{continuous}} alteration of flow resistance via {{the application of}} a magnetic field. This unique characteristic can be utilised to build semi-active dampers {{for a wide variety of}} vibration control systems, including structural, automotive, and aeronautical applications. As an example, MR fluids could enhance the performance of aircraft landing gear, which are subject to widely varied and unpredictable impact conditions with conflicting damping requirements. In this thesis, a numerical sizing methodology is developed that enables the impact performance of MR landing gears to be optimised. Using real data provided by landing gear manufacturers, the sizing methodology is applied to both lightweight aircraft, and large-scale commercial jets in order to demonstrate scalability. For both aircraft types, results indicate that the peak force and the severity of fatigue loading can be enhanced over a wide range of impact conditions. However, it is shown that MR landing gears can be heavier than passive systems. To validate the numerical approach, a prototype MR landing gear <b>shock</b> <b>strut</b> is designed, fabricated, and tested. Good correlation between the model and experiment is demonstrated, particularly for low velocity excitations. MR dampers exhibit highly non-linear force-velocity behaviour. For landing gear impacts, it transpires that this behaviour can be used to an advantage, where it is shown that an acceptable performance can be obtained using open-loop control i. e. with a constant magnetic field. However, this non-linear behaviour is highly undesirable for other scenarios (e. g. an aircraft taxiing), and as a consequence, the choice of an effecti√© control strategy remains an unresolved problem. A further aim of this thesis is therefore to develop effective control techniques for broadband excited MR vibration systems. Through an extensive series of numerical and experimental investigations, case studics representative of the general single-degree-of-freedom and two-degree-of-freedom vibration isolation problem are presented. In the experiments, the hardware-in-the-Ioopsimulation method is adopted, which provides an excellent means to bridge the gap between theory and practice when the behaviour of a specific component is complex. Here, the MR damper is physically tested, whilst the remainder of the structure is simulated in real-time. The results demonstrate that the chosen control strategy can provide significant performance benefits when compared to more commonly used strategies and equivalent passive systems. Furthermore, the control strategy is shown to be insensitive to factors such as the type of input excitation...|$|E
