5|$|Some bathhouses have areas {{designed}} to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated {{only by a}} (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths in New York or the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those <b>so</b> <b>inclined.</b> Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.|$|E
5|$|Field's {{government}} {{was startled by}} Britain's announcement in October 1963 that Nyasaland would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date was set for Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised {{that it was going}} to follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were <b>so</b> <b>inclined,</b> go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the Labour Party might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to the polls, and preferably not after Nyasaland. The Federation dissolved as scheduled at the end of 1963.|$|E

25|$|As Universal Migrator {{had enough}} content {{to form a}} two-CD album, Arjen made a key {{decision}} to sell each disc as a separate release. He believed his fans to be fundamentally {{divided into two groups}} by genre of choice, being either progressive rock or heavy metal fans. The Dream Sequencer was meant to appeal to the prog enthusiasts, and Flight of the Migrator to the metal fans, so that each could simply purchase the album of their choice, if <b>so</b> <b>inclined,</b> but to his surprise, fans bought and loved both albums.|$|E

25|$|Watchmen, as {{guardians of}} {{the peace of the}} streets, were {{supposed}} to deal within the confines of their beat with drunkenness, soliciting, and petty tumults, and detaining suspicious characters. However, they were often willing to concede privileges to certain prostitutes, consequently provoking parishioners' complains about their inability to enforce the law. Indeed, even the prostitutes taken up by the watch were frequently released after a few hours in the watch house without seeing any magistrate. The circumstances changed when theft or some other kind of crimes were committed. Public opinion, and Moreton too, firmly believed that these women needed to be restrained in their liberties not only for their vices and immoralities but because they represented a real threat to common living. Unfortunately, most of the times this was easier said than done. Watchmen had the power to apprehend criminals within the boundaries of their parish, and they were liable to be reprimanded for leaving their beats. So they might not have been <b>so</b> <b>inclined</b> to chase a woman who crossed into another parish in order to avoid being taken.|$|E

500|$|Teenage Connor is an angry, brooding, intense, and {{volatile}} teenager who is vindictive towards Angel. Vincent Kartheiser {{described him as}} withdrawn and [...] "not willing {{to open up to}} the group happiness everyone is <b>so</b> <b>inclined</b> to be part of". He also highlighted his 'alienation' of this world and resulting caution and unwillingness to trust others. Tim Minear further characterizes Connor by his strong need for family which [...] "means everything to this kid because he's never had one" [...] and put emphasis on his [...] "conflicted" [...] personality triggered by his upbringing. David Fury and Minear also highlight Connor's similarity to Angel. Fury worked on the resemblance of strength, fighting style, and personality. Minear compared their trait of accepting responsibility even in the worst times. Intending to show Connor as a formidable fighter, Kelly A. Manners described him as [...] "quite the hunter, quite the killer." [...] Kartheiser notes him as [...] "truly badass", and jokingly compares his fighting style to that of 'Jackie Chan', He is attracted to women older than him, which becomes a running gag in the series.|$|E
500|$|Bathhouses {{are usually}} dimly lit and play music, {{although}} an outdoors, enclosed rooftop or pool area is not uncommon. They are often {{laid out in}} a manner that allows or encourages customers to wander throughout the establishment; a space laid out in this way {{is often referred to as}} a [...] "maze". Some bathhouses have a space where random, anonymous sex is all that can occur. These spacesrooms, hallways, or mazes, sometimes with glory holeshave as their only illumination a (dim) red [...] "Exit" [...] sign, so one can have sex but one cannot see with whom. Other clubs, such as the Continental Baths or the Club Baths of Washington, D.C., would have two or more bunk beds placed near each other, in a public area, thus providing a place to have sex for those who can afford only to rent a locker, and also maximizing the chances of being watched, for the exhibitionists <b>so</b> <b>inclined.</b> Rooms are usually grouped together, as are lockers. Bathhouses are frequently decorated with posters of nude or semi-nude men, and sometimes explicit depictions of sex. It is not uncommon to see pornographic movies playing on wall-mounted televisions throughout the bathhouse.|$|E
500|$|The {{preceding}} {{convictions and}} penalties applied to any person, minor or adult, Oregon resident or otherwise, when the offense occurred {{within the state}} of Oregon. [...] However, Oregon marijuana law is further complicated due {{to the existence of}} Oregon's medical marijuana program. [...] The Oregon Medical Marijuana Program allows individuals with a medical history of one or more qualifying illnesses and a doctor's recommendation to apply for registration with the program. [...] Accepted applicants are issued a Medical Marijuana Card, which entitles them to different treatment under the law. [...] Essentially, medical marijuana patients are allowed to possess, without fear of citation, arrest, or penalty, up to 1.5 pounds of marijuana at a time. [...] Possession of a greater amount, however, does become punishable by law. [...] In addition to legal possession, cardholders may also legally grow, without fear of citation, arrest, or penalty, up to 18 immature cannabis plants and 6 mature ones at a single time. [...] Cardholders are also allowed to designate a primary caregiver and a grower of their choice, if <b>so</b> <b>inclined.</b> [...] These people enjoy the same freedoms, in regard to possession, as the cardholder as long as they remain officially registered. [...] The above limits of legal possession apply to the total combined property of the cardholder, caregiver, and grower. [...] If a grower is growing plants for more than one cardholder, he or she may possess up to 18 immature plants per cardholder. [...] A grower may not grow plants for more than four cardholders at a time. [...] Also, in addition to legal possession and manufacture as outlined above, cardholders, caregivers, and growers may legally deliver marijuana to each other, and to other cardholders, so long as the delivery is made without consideration. [...] The privileges which normally protect cardholders, caregivers, and growers from citation, arrest, and penalty do not excuse possession, manufacture, or delivery in cases where they are simultaneously guilty of certain offenses listed in ORS 475.316, such as driving under the influence of marijuana or using marijuana in public.|$|E

That is why they <b>so</b> <b>incline,</b> by temperament, to the Left. For capitalism merely occurs; if no-one does anything to stop it. It is socialism {{that has to be}} constructed, and, as a rule, forcibly imposed, thus providing a far bigger role for intellectuals in its genesis.

2500|$|Pianist John Tilbury – {{previously}} {{an occasional}} AMM collaborator – joined in about 1980. His shimmering Feldmanesque playing brought {{a measure of}} conventionality to AMM (relatively speaking); unlike Rowe or Prévost, Tilbury's instrument was nearly always recognisable in conventional terms. This version of AMM generally explored quieter, more meditative sounds, perhaps having {{more in common with}} minimalism—though they could generate a cacophonous racket when <b>so</b> <b>inclined.</b> Of this period, one critic has noted that [...] "their ability, after more than 35 years as a functioning unit, to avoid routines and ruts while retaining an unmistakable [...] "AMM-ness" [...] is astonishing." [...] Perhaps the most notable shift was in Rowe's approach: his playing grew increasingly subtle, and was often described in painterly terms, as though he were offering a canvas for the other musicians to color.|$|E

2500|$|Although these {{specific}} indicia of California's intent in enacting 25524.2 {{are subject to}} varying interpretation, there are two further reasons why we should not become embroiled in attempting to ascertain California's true motive. First, inquiry into legislative motive is often an unsatisfactory venture. United States v. O'Brien, 391 [...] U.S. 367, 383 (1968). What motivates one legislator {{to vote for a}} statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it. Second, it would be particularly pointless for us to engage in such inquiry here when {{it is clear that the}} States have been allowed to retain authority over the need for electrical generating facilities easily sufficient to permit a State <b>so</b> <b>inclined</b> to halt the construction of new nuclear plants by refusing on economic grounds to issue certificates of public convenience in individual proceedings. In these circumstances, it should be up to Congress to determine whether a State has misused the authority left in its hands.|$|E
2500|$|Another current open {{question}} is whether genetic influences are important for the likeliness of co-twins {{to change in the}} same way over a period of time. A link was found between the personality trait of neuroticism and a polymorphism called 5-HTTLPR in the serotonin transporter gene, but this association was not replicated in larger studies. Other candidate gene studies have provided weak evidence that some personality traits are related to AVPR1A ("ruthlessness gene") and MAOA ("Warrior gene"). [...] Genotypes, or the genetic make up of an organism, influence but don't fully decide the physical traits of a person. Those are also influenced by the environment and behaviors they are surrounded by. For example, a person's height is affected by genetics, but if they are malnourished growth will be stunted no matter what their genetic coding says. [...] Environment is also not completely responsible for an outcome in personality. An example from Psychobiology of Personality by Marvin Zuckerman is alcoholism: [...] Studies suggest that alcoholism is an inherited disease, but if a subject with a strong biological background of alcoholism in their family tree is never exposed to alcohol, they will not be <b>so</b> <b>inclined</b> regardless of their genome.|$|E

Ironically, in 1599, Fox's father, also Hubert, had signed an agreement of [...] "surrender and regrant" [...] with the English crown to avoid the complete destruction of his estates following the Nine Years' War: the lands were returned to Fox senior in recognition of his fealty. [...] Hubert junior, however, was not <b>so</b> <b>inclined,</b> preferring to stand by the family's traditional allegiance. Cromwell proved victorious and Fox lost his lands which were given to Samuel Rust, a Cromwellian soldier. [...] He in turn sold the district to two families – the Armstrongs and the Bagots. [...] The Armstrongs settled in the town and would eventually establish industries, notably a Linen factory which proved quite lucrative. [...] Andrew Armstrong (1727–1802) built Clara House {{on the west side of}} the town in the 1770s – a fine neo-classical building. [...] Members of the Armstrong family distinguished themselves in other areas of life. [...] One of them, John Armstrong, uncle of Andrew, was Governor of Menorca and author of a history of the island in 1752. Andrew Armstrong died in 1802 and the estates were sold to a Cox family, another family with notable connections.|$|E
