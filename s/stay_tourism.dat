Homestay tourism cannot thrive without the convergence of the needs of {{the rich and the poor}} based on the principle of demand mechanism, since it is a key concept in need. Malaysia can exploit the advantage of the potential of tourism endemic in rural areas, where government programs for the poor. This form of tourism is based on three aspects, namely, services, facilities and attractions. Malaysia has a strong position in traction, and unfair.

Even if Romania has an important tourism potential, in the last nineteenth years tourism didn’t contribute of more than 2 - 3 % to the national GDP. In terms of non-monetary indicators (arrivals, overnight stays, occupancy rates, average length of <b>stay)</b> <b>tourism</b> has registered a signifi-cant decline comparing with the reference year 1990. Using Input-Output analysis, known as being a useful, efficient and trustable instrument, tourism contribution to the Romanian economy was meas-ured. The Input-Output model synthesizes the intersectoral relationships existing between hotels, restaurants and travel agencies and other economic sectors and also might predict the effects gener-ated by different changes that could take place in an economy. Backward and forward linkages are used to describe how {{the increase in the}} production of tourism sector generates an increase in the de-mand for inputs from other sectors in the economy and respectively in the supply to other economic sectors.

However, a large proportion of total tourist revenue can be lost from the local area as leak-age. Nature-based tourism is diverse and little is known about how locally retained revenue varies across different forms of tourism; this is information of great importance to policy makers. This article uses data from tourist interviews and local enterprise surveys to measure the total and locally retained spending from different forms of tourism at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. Whilst total spending increased with higher cost forms of tourism and length of stay, retained spending was predicted only by length of <b>stay.</b> High-cost <b>tourism</b> may therefore be no more effective than other forms of tourism as a tool for generating local benefits from conservation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the length of}} stay of cultural tourists in a mountain destination, on the North-East of Italy. A microeconomic perspective of cultural tourism is provided, where the interest is to analyse the attitude of visitors regarding culture and their overall vacation. To this aim, visitors’ behavior to the South Tyrol s Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano (Italy) is analysed through survey data. Unlike similar studies, empirically, a zero-truncated negative binomial model is estimated as a generalization of a Poisson distribution. The analysis shows which are the main determinants that influence length of stay of cultural tourists. Nationality, age, employment, income, {{costs associated with the}} travel have an impact on length of stay. Specifically, variations in such factors correspond to variation in the span of the vacation that is also positively affected by the presence of the icemen Ötzi in the museum {{as well as by the}} presence of other cultural attractions. These findings provide an essential tool to manage heritage resources and plan the future tourism development around the Ötzi museum. length of <b>stay,</b> cultural <b>tourism,</b> museum, zero-truncated negative binomial, management implications...|$|R

However, perhaps it is in particular areas (as was the case with the thrust of industrialisation) such as the Mediterranean basin, where this view can be identified more accurately. Both approaches are reflected in the key objectives of the work. In the first section of this research we discuss the major figures available on the growth of tourism since the Second World War, whilst at the same time outlining the fundamental theoretical keystones of the study: the claim with regard to a particular techno-economic paradigm in the case of mass tourism, involved in the fifth technological revolution seen since the Industrial Revolution.

40|$|International audienceFoie gras {{is today}} {{one of the}} most contested foods. The animal welfare and rights {{movement}} disputes this product which is concurrently considered as part of heritage and embedded in tourism attractions. Technical anthropologists argue that the inclusion of animal in food involves the processes of moving the animal away, legitimising the killings and masking the animal origin of the food. However, these processes are challenged by the structural changes of society such as urbanisation and industrialisation which have also led to awareness of animal treatment and sensitiveness. Another outcome of these social developments is mobility and tourism is therefore an important metaphor of the contemporary social life. Food tourism has developed as a strategic standpoint to analyse food model dynamics. In regard to this perspective, we can question how the link between eater and animal is influenced by tourism experiences in rural territories. This study emphasises the role of the different types of rural relations {{in the construction of the}} sensibilities toward force-feeding and their adjustement during a rural experience: the <b>tourism</b> <b>stay.</b> Results show that the influence of the tourists’ experience in the change of opinion about force-feeding varies according to the respondents’ level of socialisation with the rural area, particularly the influence of the tourists’ experience in the rural areas. For city- dwellers, local tourism experience and visits to animal farms contribute to the contemporary construction of the imageries and sensibilities toward farm animals.

40|$|During the 1980 s in New Zealand, government-led {{bouts of}} {{economic}} restructuring destabilised the traditional economic foundations upon which many rural communities survived. Since then, and to evade ensuing socio-economic decline, many rural communities {{have sought to}} strengthen their local economies by developing tourism. This thesis demonstrates that increasing rural tourism development in New Zealand {{can be understood as}} part of Christopher Ray's (1998) theory of emerging rural culture economies. The first stage of the study links Ray's (1998) theory and Typology of the (Rural) Culture Economy to theory found in tourism literature. As a result, four distinct dimensions of rural tourism development are identified and described: the commodification of rural culture, identity construction and rural place promotion, local initiatives to support rural tourism growth, and the community response to tourism. The link also leads to the conclusion that tourism is an ideal strategy for rural re-development because it relies on the use of a community's local/cultural resources-physical, symbolic and human - 'local' rudiments that ensure the social and economic benefits of <b>tourism</b> <b>stay</b> fixed in the community where the exchange between host and tourist takes place. The second stage of the study uses qualitative research methods to examine Ray's (1998) rural culture economy theory and typology at one rural location where tourism has manifest: the Inner Rural Bays, Banks Peninsula (New Zealand). Results show that Ray's (1998) theory is: (1) a useful theoretical framework for rural tourism research and (2) a concise explanation for the current rise of rural tourism. Evidence suggests, however, that Ray's (1998) concept of the rural culture economy might be constrained to the early stages of rural tourism development when control is firmly in the hands of local people. Based on the results, a Typology of the Rural Tourism Culture Economy is devised. It is proposed that the Typology will be useful for individuals, groups or communities interested in forming a local rural tourism industry...|$|R

Today the village is world-famous for its world cup ski races. The first ski race for the world cup was hosted in 1986. This was another important stimulus for winter tourism in Hinterstoder. Since the competition among the candidates for World Cup races is very large and the World Cup course on the Bärenalm {{did not meet the}} requirements of the FIS anymore, the chairman of the Ski Club Hinterstoder Rudolf Rohregger urged to rapidly construct a new, more attractive and selective World Cup slope in Hinterstoder. This ambitious goal has been achieved with the new World Cup Run on the Hoess. The construction of the race course was started in late summer 2004; in the winter of 2004/05, the runway was partially available and already then caused a stir. The first World Cup race on the new slope took place in the 2006-07 season. The new [...] "Hannes Trinkl valley descent" [...] honors its namesake, one of the world's best local downhill skiers in recent years. With a length of 2,250 meters, the piste runs more or less directly into the valley with an average slope of 35 percent. Natural terrain edges and steep slopes with a gradient of 55 and 60 percent make this run particularly spectacular. The slope meets all the required criteria to hold FIS World Cup Super G, giant slalom and slalom races for men and ladies. Special attention was paid to the design of the finish arena, from where spectators can view large parts of the slope and reach the finish area easily from the nearby parking. Since its completion Hinterstoder hosted a meeting of the 2011 World Cup with complete success.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{its wide}} range of {{economic}} ripple effects, tourism seems {{to be regarded as}} a major growth industry in Japan. Japanese government tries hard not only to promote domestic tourism, but also to expand inbound tourism, by organizing "Visit Japan Campaign". When dealing with the word "tourists", it usually means people who take a short <b>stay</b> for <b>tourism</b> or leisure activities. Working holiday makers (abbreviate as WHMs below), however, who take medium and long term stay, are not included at all. WHMs are the people who participate in "working holiday" (abbreviate as WH below) programs by using a special visa to travel overseas and staying in a country for {{a certain period of time}} to experience "travel" and "work" at the same time. Through their WH experiences, they might join some tourist activities or consumption activities in the country where they stay, and might be affected by the cultures of that country. The impact of the experiences is not only on the participants themselves but also on other people through the participants' actions of disseminating the information about their experiences. In this research, I would like to focus on the characteristics of WHMs and take Taiwanese WHMs with experiences in Japan in particular as the research object, and try to clarify the patterns of consumption activities and tourist activities during their stay, and actions they took to disseminate information about their experiences. By elucidating these, this reseach can reveal the tourism values of WH programs, present the direction of practical ways of inbound tourism promotions and improvements of the systems for accepting more WHMs. At the same time, this can become a reference for understanding the issues of inbound tourism and strengthening bilateral exchanges. In order to achieve the research objectives above, questionnaires and interviews were conducted in addition to the literature review. As a result, valid questionnaires from 60 people were I obtained and 26 of whom were also actually interviewed. The result of literature review, questionnaires and interviews is summarized in Chapter 2, 3 and 4. Research motivations and purposes are noted in Chapter 1, conclusions and recommendations, future works are explained in Chapter 5. The main conclusions derived 148 from this research are summarized in the five points below: 1. Many Taiwanese WHMs with experiences in Japan were interested in Japan even before they participated in WH programs, but became more aggressively and frequently visited through their WH experiences. 2. There is a tendency that Taiwanese WHMs with experiences in Japan would stay in one or several places stably, and enjoy travels when they have spare time from their part-time job. 3. Through the actions they took to disseminate information about their WH experiences, passively or actively, Taiwanese WHMs with experiences in Japan have actually played a role of interpreters of Japan towards the people around them. 4. Taiwanese WHMs with experiences in Japan are generally satisfied with their WH experiences, but if possible, they would like to travel more than what they had actually did in Japan. 5. Because of WH is not very well known in Japan as yet, the difficulies that Taiwanese WHMs with experiences in Japan faced are the interaction with Japanese people, the complicated local formalities and regulations of Japan...|$|R
