Although first intended for the print <b>shop,</b> these <b>manuals</b> also aimed at teaching authors the mechanics of printing, in order to maintain a valuable partnership between printer and author. At {{the turn of the twentieth}} century, these texts, along with readers’ and publishers’ guidebooks, constructed a technical, professional and ideological discourse on bookmaking. This analysis of some eighteen volumes published between 1870 and 1918 focuses on the tensions between the printing house and the author, largely induced by the acceleration of mechanical tasks. It thus attempts to highlight the specificities of a discourse on bookmaking that reflects both how printers were coming to terms with mechanisation (or the threat thereof), and how they required the author’s contribution in an effort, perhaps, to ascertain the artistic and intellectual dimension of printing...|$|R

All these happen because every job in the ration <b>shop</b> involves <b>manual</b> work and there are no specific high-tech technologies to automate the job. Because of intervention of manual work there are lots of illegal activity occurs. The illegal activities are like, wrong entry in register of shop about the amount of products that given to the people, sometimes there is chance of distribution of low quality products than actual product provided by government for poor people, people do not have idea about how much quantity of good provided by government to them etc. In this paper we propose the concept about to replace manual work in public {{distribution system}} (rationing distribution system) by automated system which will be installing at the ration shop. In this automated system we replace the convectional ration card by smart card in which all the details of user provided. This prompted us to interface smart card reader (RFID Based) to the ARM. Government should have control over all transaction happen at ration shop, to involve government in the process we can connect the system which is at ration shop to the government database via GSM module...|$|R

40|$|Heuristic {{dispatching}} {{rules are}} one of the most popular and widely used methods of scheduling in dynamic job <b>shop</b> environments. The <b>manual</b> development of such dis-patching rules is time consuming and requires substantial knowledge of the domain. There have been numerous works into using genetic programming (GP) as a frame-work for the automated generation of dispatching rules for job shop scheduling envi-ronments. However most existing works do not take into account the interpretability and semantic validity of the evolved dispatching rules. In this paper we propose the use of a grammar, implemented through strongly typedGP, to restrict the GP programs to only contain semantically meaningful expressions. Experimental results show that the dispatching rules evolved in the semantically constrained search space do not have (on average) performance that is as good as unconstrained. However the interpretabil-ity of evolved rules is substantially improved. This is the firstwork usingGP for the au-tomatic discovery of dispatching rules that has explored their interpretability in depth and considered it as an important trait of an effective dispatching rule...|$|R

The {{goal of the}} project and constructed system was to determine the validity and efficacy of a process that could flatten benthic macrofauna to a consistent thickness such that a biomass for the collected sample could be accurately determined. The system that was built and tested consists of a drive train that turns a mill subassembly where the organisms are flattened, supply and collection spools that hold the white fabric and clear film used to capture the organisms, a collection zone where the sample is injected, and a superstructure that supports the device for rigidity and positioning of components. Through clever design, we were able to minimize the parts required to locate and tension the spools, allowing them to be removed and resupplied quickly. Additionally, the number of lost organisms that were not captured was minimized to under 5 %. All components and fabrication were made using typical equipment found in a machine <b>shop</b> including a <b>manual</b> mill and lathe, laser cutter, 3 D printer, and general shop tools. A software package called Matlab was used for image processing to determine sample size and calculate a biomass given the interpreted surface area of the caught sample. Ultimately, we were able to design, build, and test a system and analytical process that could determine the biomass of a sample to within ± 10 % of its actual value. We consider our proof-of-concept design to be a success and can be further developed upon with new iterations. Eventually, this system could be incorporated into an autonomous underwater rover that simultaneously collects, filters, and scans benthic samples to determine biomass and biodiversity in oceanic environments...|$|R

His younger contemporary, Humphrey Prideaux, was, in the Oxford manner, a man of the world. He {{was the son of a}} Cornish squire, was educated at Westminster under Busby (that awful pedagogue, whose birch seems so near a memory), got a studentship at Christ Church in 1668, and took his B.A. degree in 1672. Here it may be {{observed}} that men went up quite as late in life then as they do now, for Prideaux was twenty-four years old when he took his degree. Fell was Dean of Christ Church, and was showing laudable zeal in working the University Press. What a pity it is that the University Press of to-day has become a trading concern, a <b>shop</b> for twopenny <b>manuals</b> and penny primers! It is scarcely proper that the University should at once organise examinations and sell the manuals which contain the answers to the questions most likely to be set. To return to Fell; he made Prideaux edit Lucius Florus, and publish the Marmora Oxoniensia, which came out 1676. We must not suppose, however, that Prideaux was an enthusiastic archaeologist. He did the Marmora because the Dean commanded it, and because educated people were at that period not uninterested in Greek art. At the present hour one may live a lifetime in Oxford and only learn, by the accident of examining passmen in the Arundel Room, that the University possesses any marbles. In the walls of the Arundel Room (on the ground-floor in the Schools' quadrangle) these touching remains of Hellas are interred.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on 6 months of ethnographic fieldwork at a youth centre {{in a suburb of}} Manchester, England. The area is a post-industrial ward, historically characterised by the dying industry previously dominating the area. Today, the industries are gone, and a vast number of the residents are still struggling to find work. The old factory buildings have reopened as daily markets and <b>shopping</b> centres, and <b>manual</b> labour in the industries has mainly been replaced by service sector jobs. The youth centre where I volunteered is one of the improvement measures set out to re-establish the local community. This thesis is an attempt to understand and interpret the individual experiences of the recent changes in the neighbourhood. The conduction of this research is primarily based on an investigation of the people I worked with at the local youth centre. I will draw parallels between political events and changes in British history and its effects on the neighbourhood, and the way people organise themselves socially, experience their everyday lives and the opportunities they perceive themselves as having. I will illustrate mechanisms for creation of distance utilised by individuals in order to establish perceived separation from people, places and social statuses they do not identify, or want to be identified with. In order to give my research more depth and validity, I have also investigated people’s experience of living in the local neighbourhood surrounding the youth centre. I consider this a necessity as the primary users of the centre, and the people I was working together with, were from the local neighbourhood. Of particular interest is the ambiguity in regards to people´s sense of belonging to this place where they lived and, at least for a vast majority of them, had spent their entire lives. This ambiguity took the form of an experienced tension between a deep sense of belonging to the local area and a strong insistence on the individual´s non-identification with the local area. I will also investigate how people were creating distance in confrontations with the class-status. I will discuss the argument made by some scholars before me that the resistance of middle-class values result in a strengthened working class identity. My findings suggest that the individuals commonly categorised as working-class did indeed distance themselves from the middle class, but also from their working-class categorisation. I will in this thesis explore the different nuances of this, the complexities that follow any socially connected group of people, which will necessarily consist of vast diversity...|$|R
40|$|The present state-of-art of the {{techniques}} of planning and controlling production in batch shops has been surveyed and the operational characteristic of batch shops have been identified. There is a need in <b>manual</b> <b>shops</b> to introduce methods of systematic capacity planning through balancing of workload by flexible labour assignment, assigning realistic and attainable due dates and processing information to aid management decisions. A methodology is required by which the multiplicity of batch-shop variables {{can be reduced to}} a manageable level so that the factors which have a direct effect upon shop performance can be identified and controlled. A stochastic model based on queueing-network theory is presented which describes the behavior of wip in batch shops by predicting the mean delay experienced by batches at individual work centres. A batch shop is modelled as a flow network with Markovian transitions between work centres which are determined by the routing probability matrices of a known product mix. A method of solution by decomposition is used, where each work centre is considered as a single-stage queueing system, for estimating the mean delay and wip. The queueing characteristics at a work centre are described by the first two moments of the arrival and processing time distributions. The effect of production uncertainties on the processing characteristics at work centres is accounted for by forming a composite processing time distribution with which the mean delay at the work centres are computed. The model was validated in two batch shops by predicting mean delays. Subsequently, the measures of wip and the expected flow-times of individual batches were predicted by the model. Poisson-exponential models were found to be inadequate for representing the operational characteristics of batch shops; the model employing general distributions of processing time which were approximated by the first two moments was found to be adequate. In this model the arrivals at work centres were represented by their first two moments which were not far from those of a Poisson process. The mathematical accuracy of the model, in predicting mean delays, was within ± 15 per cent. The mean delays predicted by the model were within ± 30 per cent of those observed in the shops; this result was within the random variation due to sampling error. A substantial proportion of wip which varied from 30 to 60 per cent was due to the planned operator unavailability at the work centres which had not been fully loaded. The interruptions to processing due to non-productive activities caused wip to increase by 40 to 60 per cent at fully-loaded work centres and 20 to 30 per cent at lightly-loaded work centres. Both shops were observed to carry wip which was nearly twice as large as the wip in the work-centre queues; this excess wip was located at the entry and exit or final assembly stages of the shops. This wip was attributed to the surplus shop time allowed to some batches under the constant shop time rule and it is proposed that the assignment of flow time based due dates and the use of a detailed scheduling system based on these for releasing and progressing batches would help reduce wip in the shops. The accuracy of the mean-delay formulae employed in the model is sensitive to the shape of the arrival distributions. It is hypothesised that the arrival distributions in batch shops will approach a Poisson process in which case the accuracy of the model would improve. This research has shown that mathematical models of batch shops can be developed and employed to predict wip; the lack of mathematical rigour does not necessarily limit the robustness of the model so long as it is based on empirical assumptions which can be verified. However, the model is expected to yield pessimistic measures of wip in shops where the scheduling system is capable of eliminating a proportion of the. random-flow conditions assumed in the model. The validation of the model, in a different production environment, would require minor adjustments of the model...|$|R
