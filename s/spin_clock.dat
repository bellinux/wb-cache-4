A NSE spectrometer measures small velocity changes of the neutrons encoded by the neutrons <b>spin</b> <b>clock</b> at a sample while the Neutron spin precesses in large magnetic fields following Bloch's equation. This instrument will be the best of its class both with respect to resolution and dynamic range. In order to reach this ambitious goal, a large magnetic precision field integral before and after the sample is required which directly scales linearly with the resolution of the instrument. Therefore superconducting technology will be used to allow for a higher magnetic field integral. Here, we present the design, manufacturing and test performance of the solenoids which are the result of a collaboration between Julich Research Center (FZJ) and Babcock Noell GmbH (BNG). The solenoids generate an integrated magnetic flux density of 1. 8 T*m and use active shielding to reduce the fringe field. The operation temperature of about 4 K is reached by means of pulse-tube coolers in order to minimize vibrations. A special feature of this magnet system is the very accurate measurement of the cold mass-position after cool-down and during operation. The accuracy of this measurement system is in the order of micrometers. This information is required for the adjustment of so called Fresnel coils outside the cryostat. Using these correction elements, a field integral homogeneity better than 10 (- 6) T*m for different Neutron paths through one of the solenoids can be achieved...|$|E

40|$|By {{using the}} Monte Carlo simulation, we {{investigate}} the critical {{behavior of the}} 1 -dimensional spin system with infinite long-range (LR) interaction r^{-(1 +σ) }. By changing the value σ, we compare the results {{with those of the}} d-dimensional spin system with the nearest-neighbor(NN) interaction only.

In the case of q-state <b>clock</b> <b>spin</b> model with σ = 1, we also confirm the BKT-like transition together with the similar q-dependence of the critical behavior to that of the 2 -dimensional NN model.

40|$|A {{problem of}} current {{interest}} is the estimation of spatially distributed processes at locations where measurements are missing. Linear interpolation methods rely on the Gaussian assumption, which is often unrealistic in practice, or normalizing transformations, which are successful only for mild deviations from the Gaussian behavior. We propose {{to address the problem}} of missing values estimation on two-dimensional grids by means of spatial classification methods based on <b>spin</b> (Ising, Potts, <b>clock)</b> models. The "spin" variables provide an interval discretization of the process values, and the spatial correlations are captured in terms of interactions between the spins. The spins at the unmeasured locations are classified by means of the "energy matching" principle: the correlation energy of the entire grid (including prediction sites) is estimated from the sample-based correlations. We investigate the performance of the spin classifiers in terms of computational speed, misclassification rate, class histogram and spatial correlations reproduction using simulated realizations of spatial random fields, real rainfall data, and a digital test image. We also compare the spin-based methods with standard classifiers such as the k-nearest neighbor, the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor, and the Support Vector Machine. We find that the spin-based classifiers provide competitive choices. Comment: 44 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
40|$|The Unmanifested Invisible Supreme Space is the {{ultimate}} reality. It is called Brahman in Hindu philosophy. When there is a slight movement / motion in that Brahman, sound begin to originate. This sound creates PHYSICAL spacetime. Then emerges the formation of material objects. The physical spacetime has meaning {{if and only if}} there is matter. So, in a sense matter is the prime source for the properties of physical spacetime. Then this invisible Supreme space gives energy for the formation of five fundamental boothas namely soil, water, fire, air and physical space. The combination of these five boothas is the cause for all kinds of life. So, in this universe each and everything is the manifestation of energy only.

40|$|Will be submiittedThe {{symmetry}} of spins, lattice dimension {{and the type}} of coupling interaction are all important for the existence of phase transition, firmly exemplified by the two dimensional (2 D) six-state clock model[1]. This is the discrete counterpart of the continuous XY model which is the native host for a unique type of phase transition called Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition, separating the quasi-long range order (QLRO) and the higher temperature paramagnetic phase. Due to the discrete {{symmetry of}} <b>spins,</b> the six-state <b>clock</b> model experiences an additional KT transition at low temperature, separating the QLRO and the lower temperature ordered phase. In probing the role played by the spatial dimension on the existing KT transition, here we study the six-state clock model on rewired square lattice. The lattice is obtained by adding an extra link to each site of square lattice, connecting each spin to one of its next-nearest neighbors. This type of structure had been previously studied in the context of non-canonical spin glasses[2, 3, 4]. The average number of nearest links increases from two to three, which corresponds to increase in dimensionality. We used Wang-Landau algorithm of Monte Carlo simulation[5] and calculated the correlation ratio in probing the properties of the native KT transition. We observed two KT transitions which shifted to higher temperatures. This indicates that the existing lower temperature ordered phase is more robust compared to that observed in the native square lattice[6]...|$|R
40|$|Semiconductor microcavities {{have emerged}} to present {{abundant}} opportunities for both device applications and basic quantum optics studies. Here we investigate {{several aspects of}} the cw and ultrafast optical response of semiconductor quantum well microcavities. The interaction of a high-finesse semiconductor microcavity mode with a quantum well (QW) exciton leads to normal mode coupling (NMC), where a periodic energy exchange develops between exciton and photon states, appearing as a double peak in the cavity transmission spectrum and a beating in the time resolved signal. The nonlinear saturation of the excitonic NMC leads to a reduction of the modulation depth of the NMC oscillations and corresponding transmission peaks with little change in oscillation period or NMC splitting. This behavior arises from excitonic broadening due to carrier-carrier and polarization scattering without reduction of the oscillator strength. The nonlinear NMC microcavity luminescence exhibits three excitation regimes, from reversible normal mode coupling, through an intermediate double-peaked emission regime, to lasing. The nonlinear PL spectrum is governed by density-dependent changes in both the bare QW emission and in the microcavity transmission. The temporal evolution of the microcavity emission {{is analogous to the}} density-dependent behavior, and can be attributed to a time-dependent carrier density which results from a combination of carrier cooling and photon emission. A strong magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane of a QW confines electrons and holes to Landau orbits in the QW plane, transforming the QW into a quantum dot (QD) whose radius shrinks with increasing magnetic field strength. This strong magnetic confinement enhances the normal mode coupling strength in the microcavity via an increase in exciton oscillator strength. The time-resolved stimulated emission of a QW microcavity which has been transformed to a QD laser by magnetic confinement reveals a fast relaxation which is uninhibited by the magnetic field, indicating the absence of a phonon bottleneck. As a novel manifestation of cavity-modified emission, we demonstrate synchronization of the stimulated emission of a microcavity laser to the electron spin precession in a magnetic field, achieved by modulating the optical gain for the circularly polarized emission via the Larmor precession. The oscillating laser emission is locked to the completely internal electron <b>spin</b> precession <b>clock,</b> and the GHz oscillation frequencies depend only on the magnetic field strength and the QW material parameters...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{make the}} first {{quantitative}} estimates of the magnetopause reconnection rate at Jupiter using extended in situ data sets, building on simple order of magnitude estimates made some thirty years ago by Brice and Ionannidis (1970) and Kennel and Coroniti (1975, 1977). The jovian low-latitude magnetopause (open flux production) reconnection voltage is estimated using the Jackman et al. (2004) algorithm, validated at Earth, previously applied to Saturn, and here adapted to Jupiter. The high-latitude (lobe) magnetopause reconnection voltage is similarly calculated using the related Gérard et al. (2005) algorithm, also previously used for Saturn. We employ data from the Ulysses spacecraft obtained during periods when it was located near 5 AU and within 5 ° of the ecliptic plane (January to June 1992, January to August 1998, and April to October 2004), along with data from the Cassini spacecraft obtained during the Jupiter flyby in 2000 / 2001. We include the effect of magnetospheric compression through dynamic pressure modulation, and also {{examine the effect of}} variations in the direction of Jupiter's magnetic axis throughout the jovian day and year. The intervals of data considered represent different phases in the solar cycle, such that we are also able to examine solar cycle dependency. The overall average low-latitude reconnection voltage is estimated to be ~ 230 kV, such that the average amount of open flux created over one solar rotation is ~ 500 GWb. We thus estimate the average time to replenish Jupiter's magnetotail, which contains ~ 300 - 500 GWb of open flux, to be ~ 15 - 25 days, corresponding to a tail length of ~ 3. 8 - 6. 5 AU. The average high-latitude reconnection voltage is estimated to be ~ 130 kV, associated with lobe "stirring". Within these averages, however, the estimated voltages undergo considerable variation. Generally, the low-latitude reconnection voltage exhibits a "background" of ~ 100 kV that is punctuated by one or two significant enhancement events during each solar rotation, in which the voltage is elevated to ~ 1 - 3 MV. The high-latitude voltages are estimated to be about a half of these values. We note that the peak values of order a few MV are comparable to the potential drop due to sub-corotating plasma flows in the equatorial magnetosphere between ~ 20 R J and the magnetopause, such that during these periods magnetopause reconnection may {{have a significant effect on}} the otherwise rotationally dominated magnetosphere. Despite such variations during each solar rotation, however, the total amount of open flux produced during each solar rotation varies typically by less than ~ 30 % on either side of the overall average for that epoch. The averages over individual data epochs vary over the solar cycle from ~ 600 GWb per solar rotation at solar maximum to ~ 400 GWb at solar minimum. In addition we show that the IMF sector with positive clock angle is favoured for reconnection when the jovian <b>spin</b> axis <b>clock</b> angle is also positive, and vice versa, although this effect represents a first order correction to the voltage, which is primarily modulated by IMF strength and direction...|$|R
