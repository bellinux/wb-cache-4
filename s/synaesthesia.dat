5|$|In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in {{the music}} (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the {{conductor}} in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's <b>synaesthesia,</b> which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he {{said that he did}} not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie ("Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple ("gold and brown") to the highly detailed ("blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant").|$|E
25|$|Since {{the rise}} of the Internet in the 1990s, synesthetes began {{contacting}} one another and creating web sites devoted to the condition. These rapidly grew into international organizations such as the American Synesthesia Association, the UK <b>Synaesthesia</b> Association, the Belgian <b>Synaesthesia</b> Association, the Canadian Synesthesia Association, the German Synesthesia Association, and the Netherlands Synesthesia Web Community.|$|E
25|$|These traits he {{integrated}} in Paradisul suspinelor, {{one of the}} most experimental (and possibly the earliest) avant-garde novel or novella by a Romanian—although it remains shadowed by Caragiale's Craii de Curtea-Veche. He added to the mix psychoanalytical and sexual themes, with an unreliable narrator that hinted the influence of André Gide. According to Vianu, much of the novel is also an imagist rearrangement of borrowings from Arghezi's prose, with echoes from Baudelaire's <b>synaesthesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Galton was a polymath {{who made}} {{important}} contributions in many fields of science, including meteorology (the anti-cyclone {{and the first}} popular weather maps), statistics (regression and correlation), psychology (<b>synaesthesia),</b> biology (the nature and mechanism of heredity), and criminology (fingerprints). Much of this was influenced by his penchant for counting or measuring. Galton prepared the first weather map published in The Times (1 April 1875, showing the weather from the previous day, 31 March), now a standard feature in newspapers worldwide.|$|E
500|$|He {{travelled}} {{widely and}} wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, {{the landscape of}} Bryce Canyon in Utah {{and the life of}} St. Francis of Assisi. He said he perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords (a phenomenon known as <b>synaesthesia</b> in its literal manifestation); combinations of these colours, he said, were important in his compositional process. For a short period Messiaen experimented with the parametrisation associated with [...] "total serialism", in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His style absorbed many global musical influences such as Indonesian gamelan (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works).|$|E
500|$|The {{greatest}} literary strengths in Tipping the Velvet, {{according to}} reviewers and literary scholars, are the vibrant {{portrayal of the}} districts and streets of London, and Waters' ability to create sympathetic and realistic characters. Her use of <b>synaesthesia</b> in lush descriptions particularly interested Harriet Malinowitz in The Women's Review of Books. For example, Malinowitz cites the scene when Nan first meets Kitty, removing her glove to shake Kitty's hand. Very much an oyster girl, Nan's hands are covered with [...] "those rank sea-scents, of liquor and oyster-flesh, crab-meat and whelks, which had flavoured my fingers and those of my family {{for so many years}} we had ceased, entirely, to notice them." [...] Nan is mortified that she smells like a herring, but Kitty assuages her fears, kissing her hand and telling her she instead smells like a mermaid. Malinowitz includes this and other descriptions of sights, sounds, and smells in Victorian London as examples of elements that are [...] "breathlessly and wittily detailed".|$|E
500|$|The second album, Barrett, was {{recorded}} more sporadically than the first, with sessions taking place between February and July 1970. The album {{was produced by}} David Gilmour, and featured Gilmour on bass guitar, Richard Wright on keyboard and Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley. The first two songs attempted were for Barrett to play and/or sing to an existing backing track. However, Gilmour thought they were losing the [...] "Barrett-ness". One track ("Rats") was originally recorded with Barrett on his own. That would later be overdubbed by musicians, despite the changing tempos. Shirley said of Barrett's playing: [...] "He would never play the same tune twice. Sometimes Syd couldn't play anything that made sense; other times what he'd play was absolute magic." [...] At times Barrett, who experienced <b>synaesthesia,</b> would say: [...] "Perhaps we could make the middle darker and maybe the end a bit middle afternoonish. At the moment it's too windy and icy".|$|E
500|$|In {{what has}} been called [...] "a brief moment of {{remarkable}} creativity", in 2000, Sega restructured its arcade and console development teams into nine semi-autonomous studios headed by the company's top designers. Studios included United Game Artists (UGA) (headed by former Sega Rally Championship producer Tetsuya Mizuguchi), Hitmaker (headed by Crazy Taxi creator and future Sega president Hisao Oguchi), Smilebit (headed by Shun Arai and including many former Panzer Dragoon and future Yakuza developers from Team Andromeda), Overworks (headed by Noriyoshi Oba and composed of developers from Sega franchises including Sakura Wars, Shinobi and Streets of Rage), Sega AM2 (Sega's most famous arcade studio and the developer of Sega's Virtua Fighter fighting game series, headed by the company's top developer, Yu Suzuki), and Sonic Team (the developer of Sega's flagship series, Sonic the Hedgehog, headed by Yuji Naka). Sega's design houses were encouraged to experiment and benefited from a relatively lax approval process, resulting in titles such as Rez (an attempt to simulate <b>synaesthesia</b> {{in the form of a}} rail shooter), The Typing of the Dead (a version of The House of the Dead 2 remade into a touch typing trainer), Seaman (a pet simulator in which players use a microphone to interact with a grotesque humanoid fish whose growth is narrated by Leonard Nimoy), and Segagaga (a Japan-exclusive role-playing-game employing commentary on the perceived over-abundance of sequels produced by the video game industry, in which players are tasked with preventing Sega from going out of business). Sega also revived franchises from the Genesis era, such as [...] Sega's internal studios were consolidated starting in 2003, with Mizuguchi leaving the company following the merger of UGA with Sonic Team.|$|E

2500|$|Synesthesia (also spelled <b>synæsthesia</b> or synaesthesia; {{from the}} Ancient Greek [...] syn, [...] "together", and [...] aisthēsis, [...] "") is a perceptual {{phenomenon}} in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences {{in a second}} sensory or cognitive pathway.

2500|$|Other notable synesthetes include musicians Billy Joel, Itzhak Perlman, Alexander Frey, Ida Maria, Brian Chase and Patrick Stump; actress Stephanie Carswell (credited as Stéphanie Montreux); {{inventor}} Nikola Tesla; electronic musician Richard D. James aka Aphex Twin (who {{claims to}} be inspired by lucid dreams as well as music); and classical pianist Hélène Grimaud. Drummer Mickey Hart of The Grateful Dead wrote about his experiences with <b>synaesthesia</b> in his autobiography Drumming at the Edge of Magic.

He considers that the contemporary civilization is living in a cultural [...] "dark age" [...] of [...] "musical pollution". He considers musical composing a science rather than an art, similar to Pythagoreanism. He has a mystical viewpoint on music as [...] "one of the greatest forces in the universe", that the [...] "music exists before we exist".

2500|$|Ordinal-linguistic {{personification}} (OLP, or personification for short) {{is a form}} of synesthesia {{in which}} ordered sequences, such as ordinal numbers, week-day names, months and alphabetical letters are associated with personalities or genders (...) [...] For example, the number 2 might be a young boy with a short temper, or the letter G might be a busy mother with a kind face. Although this form of synesthesia was documented as early as the 1890s ( [...] ; [...] ) researchers have, until recently, paid little attention to this form (see History of synesthesia research). [...] This form of synesthesia was named as OLP in the contemporary literature by Julia Simner and colleagues [...] although it is now also widely recognised by the term [...] "sequence-personality" [...] <b>synaesthesia.</b> [...] Ordinal linguistic personification normally co-occurs with other forms of synesthesia such as grapheme-color synesthesia.|$|E
2500|$|Demetriade's other poems were rhetorical, {{the imagery}} and themes romantic and Baudelairean; their {{subjects}} included demonism, genius, spiritual ascension and melancholy ("spleen"). His more experimental pieces included the 1906 sonnet Sonuri și culori ("Sounds and Colors"), which was heavily indebted to Rimbaud's <b>synaesthesia,</b> assigning deeper meanings to isolated vowels. Such work, often eroticized, received a radical critique from the traditionalist intellectuals of Transylvania: a reviewer for Rĕvașul newspaper, claiming {{to speak for}} his entire region, called Demetriade's [...] "orgiastic" [...] poems [...] "an ugly torrent". According to Davidescu, Demetrescu's poetry mainly stands out for its sensuality and eroticism, [...] "preserving the author's very character, which cannot but evoke to mind [...] that tanned man, as restless as a squirrel, with his black beard and eyes, always open to new sensations, always {{a man of his}} word, at once impulsive and self-contained, and always generous". Contrarily, the literary historian Șerban Cioculescu describes Demetriade, overall, as [...] "faint and subdued".|$|E
2500|$|The phrase synesthesia in art has {{historically}} {{referred to a}} wide variety of artists experiments that have explored the co-operation of the senses (e.g. seeing and hearing; the word synesthesia is from the Ancient Greek σύν (syn), [...] "together," [...] and αἴσθησις (aisthēsis), [...] "sensation") in the genres of visual music, music visualization, audiovisual art, abstract film, and intermedia (Campen 2007, Jewanski & Sidler 2006, Moritz 2003, 1999, Berman 1999, Maur 1999, Gage 1994, 1999). [...] The age-old artistic views on synesthesia have some overlap with the current neuroscientific view on neurological synesthesia, but also some major differences, e.g. in the contexts of investigations, types of synesthesia selected, and definitions. While in neuroscientific studies synesthesia is defined as the elicitation of perceptual experiences in the absence of the normal sensory stimulation, in the arts the concept of <b>synaesthesia</b> is more often defined as the simultaneous perception of two or more stimuli as one gestalt experience (Campen 2009).|$|E
2500|$|In 1993 James {{released}} Analogue Bubblebath 3; the [...] "On" [...] EP and its accompanying remix EP; {{his second}} Bradley Strider EP, Bradley's Robot; two more Caustic Window EPs {{and his first}} releases on Warp Records, Surfing on Sine Waves and [...] "Quoth EP", as Polygon Window. Warp Records released Selected Ambient Works Volume II in 1994, with a less beat- and melody-driven sound than the previous album. The track names were described with pie chart symbols, each of which {{was meant to be}} paired with a corresponding image in the album jacket (except [...] "Blue Calx"). To decipher the titles, listeners had to compare the length of each track with the size of the pie-chart symbols; for example, the first title (often called [...] "Cliffs"), is realised by pairing the first symbol with the first image (a rocky cliffside). James said in The Wire magazine and elsewhere that the tracks were inspired by lucid dreams and <b>synaesthesia.</b> Other releases were a fourth Analogue Bubblebath; GAK (derived from early demos sent to Warp Records), and Classics, a compilation album with [...] "Digeridoo" [...] EP and the Xylem Tube EP.|$|E
