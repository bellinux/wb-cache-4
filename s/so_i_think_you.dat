6000|$|... "I think you're hateful and mean," [...] exclaimed Felicity. [...] "It hasn't {{anything}} to do with Miss Reade, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> might tell us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do; and {{you will}} pardon me if I say {{improperly}} <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> were wrong in suffering Jane {{to go with him}} this afternoon." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> now, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> {{understand}} {{something of the}} general political surroundings of the great election in Missinaba County.|$|R
60|$|Serv. Yet {{that short}} time you staid at Barcelona <b>You</b> husbanded <b>so</b> well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> left A {{mistress}} there.|$|R
60|$|I'm afraid you'll {{think it}} silly and vain {{of me to}} say <b>so,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> should know that--that Ronny's in love with me. That is why I want him to go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Adela, you do; I {{think you}} do. I think I am honest and open. At any rate, I {{strive to be}} <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> do {{understand}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wrote {{three weeks}} ago. I suppose I shall hear about half-way through December, {{and you know}} they could {{telegraph}} {{if they wanted to}} stop it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> might be satisfied.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, boy, cussin' won't do any good. Now {{lay still}} an' let me work. You've {{had lots of}} good news this mornin'. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can stand to hear a little bad news." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh miss!" [...] said mild Liddy, looking pitifully into Bathsheba's face. [...] "I {{am sorry}} we mistook <b>you</b> <b>so!</b> <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>you</b> cared for him; but I see you don't now." ...|$|R
60|$|Mask. So, in short, sir, we drew, first I, {{and then}} my master; but, being overpowered, they have escaped us, <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> may go to bed, and trouble {{yourself}} no further, for gone they are.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Dr. Octopus pins Spider-Manto the wall. Episode {{director}} Jennifer Coyle {{opined that}} [...] "Those arms are amazing, {{and the timing}} has been really good for this show, so much <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> feel the impact of those arms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, certainly," [...] she answered; [...] "and if {{you will}} excuse me for saying <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are a very {{fortunate}} man. In trying to punish me you protected yourself,--that is, if you care to have secretaries from our institution." ...|$|E
6000|$|Longfellow, in his reply, said: [...] "I do {{not believe}} anybody [...] was much hurt. Certainly I was not, and Holmes tells me he [...] was not. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> may dismiss the matter from your [...] mind without further remorse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>so?</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{must have}} {{misunderstood}} my theory of life. When a woman elects to marry, and does so from sheer love and {{regard for the}} man, she should certainly make her duty to him the first motive of all her actions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{never do}} come to such little towns; <b>you</b> said <b>so,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are very cross, and I won't {{take care of}} Sanch, so, now!" [...] cried Bab, getting into a passion, yet ready to cry, she was so disappointed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Had {{to have a}} {{large piece}} of silver tube let into his throat, and if he wants to talk he puts his finger on it. It makes him <b>so</b> interesting, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>You</b> feel he's sincere somehow. A most charming man in every way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Weejee! Weejee!" [...] called Mrs. Sopley. [...] "How DARE you, sir! You're just a BAD dog!! Go and lie down, sir. I'm <b>so</b> sorry. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> know, it's your white trousers. For {{some reason}} Weejee simply HATES white trousers. I do hope he hasn't torn them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{smoke is}} not going either way," [...] said Rollo. [...] "It mounts right {{straight}} up into the air; but Philippe says he thinks {{it is going to}} be a fine day, and he has ordered breakfast. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> had better get up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] he {{hastened to}} assure her, [...] "they have not treated {{me at all}} badly--why should they? If I die they can collect no ransom on me. It is the same with you, Barbara, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> need {{apprehend}} no harsh treatment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} will find the berth a {{pleasant}} one. Of course, I don't know what arrangements will be made, or whether you would permanently live on board one of the boats. If <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would be envied by all of us, as you would get away from the dust, and all the discomforts of the encampment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word {{all this}} {{seems to me to}} be <b>so</b> very--very,--distasteful that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> had better say nothing more about it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Erwin Chemerinsky, {{the dean}} of the law school at the University of California, Irvine, stated, [...] "the California Supreme Court has never {{articulated}} criteria for what makes something an amendment versus a revision. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> donâ€™t <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can predict anything because there is so little law." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet it {{will find}} you out before all is done, or <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> Look <b>you,</b> pagan blood still runs in me, and, Christian though I am, I would not dare {{one of the great}} gods of Greece and Rome. I'd leave that to the priests. Do you fear nothing, Olaf?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he has {{wiped out}} the Amakoba, the enemies of his House, {{and there are the}} hundred cattle whereof he has many more, and now it is too late for you to keep your share of the bargain. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> must make {{yourself}} as comfortable as you can in the hole that your hands dug, Umbezi, which I would not share for all the cattle in Zululand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know," [...] he declared, [...] "if I {{might be}} {{permitted}} to say <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are taking the gaming here a little too seriously. If you have been unlucky, {{it is very easy}} to arrange an advance for you. Would you like some money? If so, I will see to it when I go to the bank to-morrow. I can let you have a hundred pounds at once, if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, father, but {{all that}} was meant in my case was that I would say nothing which would cause injury to those to whom I promised; and it will do them no injury {{whatever}} by telling you in confidence. Besides, it is probable you may learn about it in some other way; because, unfortunately, I broke the other fellow's leg very badly, {{and there is no}} saying what may come of it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> ought to know all the circumstances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{memory is}} good, Tell. <b>So</b> is mine. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{made a few}} remarks to me on that occasion, Tell--a few chatty remarks? Eh, Tell?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Georgiana, {{you make}} me very unhappy. I am wretched to see you <b>so</b> discontented. If <b>I</b> could do {{anything}} for you, I would. But I will not meddle about Mr Brehgert. I shouldn't dare to do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> know how angry your papa can be.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} is getting better," [...] said Fred. [...] "You always say <b>so,</b> but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have {{anything}} to show for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Olive," [...] said she, [...] "I {{will give}} you a piece of advice. When your father and his young wife come here, treat her exactly as if she were your old friend. If you do <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will get along very well. This is partly selfish advice, for I greatly desire the {{opportunity}} to treat your father hospitably. He was my friend when I was a girl, you remember, and I looked up to him with very great admiration." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I say, [...] "what you can,"' said Mrs. Dusautoy. 'You {{see before}} you a single-handed man. Only {{two of the}} ladies here can be called coadjutors, one being poor little Genevieve Durant, the other the bookseller's daughter, Clarissa Richardson, who made all the rest fly off. All the others do what good they mean to do {{according}} to their own sweet will, free and independent women, and we can't have any district system, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can only do what just comes to hand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. I do {{not like}} not to take your advice, but I do believe this is my duty. I do not think my {{determination}} is made in self-will,' said Guy, thoughtfully; 'I cannot think that I ought to neglect my uncle, because I happen {{to have been born}} in a different station, which is all I have heard proved against him,' he added, smiling. 'You will forgive me, will you not, for not following your advice? for really and truly, if you will let me say <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would not have given it if Philip had not been talking to you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|BROADBENT [delighted]. <b>I</b> hope <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> [Fluctuating] <b>You</b> really <b>think</b> so? <b>You</b> {{are sure}} you are not {{allowing}} your enthusiasm for our principles to {{get the better of}} your judgment? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, you know, {{there was}} a pause. I {{had a sort of}} intuition that the moment was coming. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> had she. <b>You</b> may scoff, of course, at these intuitions----" ...|$|R
6000|$|L. There is no stupidity; {{you could}} not {{possibly}} do more than guess at anything <b>so</b> vague. But <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you,</b> Sibyl, at least, might have recollected what first dyed the mulberry? ...|$|R
