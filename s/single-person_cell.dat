25|$|However, the {{majority}} of inmates have been sent there because they have an extensive history of committing violent crimes against corrections officers and fellow inmates in other prisons, {{up to and including}} murder. These inmates are kept in administrative segregation. They are confined in a specifically designed <b>single-person</b> <b>cell</b> for 23 hours a day. They are removed under restraint (handcuffed, shackled or both), on a 24-hour clock (e.g., their one-hour time out of their cell may occur at any time of the day or night). The hour outside of the cell is for showering; exercise, and with privileges, a phone call. Their diet is restricted as well; to ensure that the foods they are served (in their cell) can't be used to harm themselves, or to make unhygienic conditions in their cell.|$|E

As of 2002, one cell was being converted into a female shower block, two cells were set-aside for segregated detention and one cell had padded walls. Closed-circuit television is used to monitor detainees.|$|R

They were allowed no human contact, no light, and {{very little in the}} way of food or protection from the summer heat, or winter cold. There was no medical treatment for injuries caused by torture and diseases like tuberculosis. Also, the food rations were minimal. There are also allegations of executions. All in all, 35 prisoners, or more than half of the people incarcerated at Tazmamart during the eighteen years died, before the prison was finally closed in 1991.|$|R
