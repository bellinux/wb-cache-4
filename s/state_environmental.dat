5|$|On March 21, 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling {{in the case}} of Dunn v. Blumstein that found that a citizen who had lived in a state for 30 days was {{resident}} in that state and thus eligible to vote there. Kentucky's Constitution required residency of one year in the state, six months in the county and sixty days in the precinct to establish voting eligibility. This issue had to be resolved before the 1972 presidential election in November, so Ford called a special legislative session to enact the necessary corrections. In addition, Ford added to the General Assembly's agenda the creation of a <b>state</b> <b>environmental</b> protection agency, a refinement of congressional districts in line with the latest census figures and ratification of the recently passed Equal Rights Amendment. All of these measures passed.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Petr Nečas defended Drobil, {{and called}} Michálek untrustworthy despite his public {{reputation}} as a whistleblower. Since the Civic Democrats vowed to fight corruption, losing its first minister to corruption charges was {{a blow to the}} party's standing. The Drobil incident was the first of several high-profile resignations. On December 21, 2010, Czech Police Chief Oldrich Martinu resigned after Interior Minister Radek John's month-long call for his ouster in part due to the Drobil case's mishandling. Michálek returned to the <b>State</b> <b>Environmental</b> Fund as a financial analyst in 2011. The Drobil case is on indefinite hiatus for a lack of evidence as of September 2012. As of February 2013, the case against Knetig is on a similar hiatus for insufficient evidence.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Isabel, Governor Ed Rendell {{declared}} a state of emergency for the state. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency activated a support team to assist Urban Search and Rescue operations as part of the threat from the storm. The state's National Guard placed 2,990guardsmen on Emergency Condition 5 status to be deployed anywhere in the state for emergency support, with other guardsmen readying equipment such as generators, heavy trucks, water trailers, and engineer equipment for deployment. State police officers were readied for deployment, while the state health department contacted hospitals to ensure generators were in working condition. The <b>state</b> <b>Environmental</b> Protection Agency prepared for the storm by monitoring the status of all dams, water treatment facilities, and nuclear plants. In addition, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission stationed extra workers to patrol the highways in poor drainage areas, with extra equipment prepared for quick response for potential road blockage. Prior {{to the arrival}} of the storm, officials from PECO Energy prepared its largest workforce in its history with 1,500workers, including employees from Commonwealth Edison in Illinois and Detroit Edison.|$|E

Hybrid buses which run on both diesel and electricity are also being considered for the future. Because Porto Alegre has a ready supply of natural gas, the city's taxi fleet is gradually being converted to it from gasoline.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{favorable}} laws, promising institutional arrangements, {{and external}} funding, {{the government has}} not, on the whole, been effective in controlling damage to the environment. This failure is only in small measure because of the opposition of anti-environmental groups. In greater part, it {{can be attributed to}} the traditional separation between official rhetoric and actual practice in Brazil. It is also related to general problems of governance, fiscal crisis, and lingering doubts about appropriate tradeoffs between the environment and development. Some of the most effective governmental action in the environmental area has occurred at the state and local levels in the most developed states and has involved NGOs. In 1994 the PNMA began to stress decentralization and strengthening of <b>state</b> <b>environmental</b> agencies, a tendency that subsequently gained momentum.|$|E

25|$|On November 9, 2016, {{a massive}} fire struck the Industrial Materials Recycling {{facility}} {{located in the}} plant's former galvanizing, cold mill, and hot mill buildings. The fire, which began at about 7 AM after a lightbulb exploded over flammable materials, was fought by more than 100 firefighters from Lackawanna, Buffalo, and other towns. Several explosions were caused by the fire, which collapsed {{the roof of the}} structure and caused other heavy damage to it. Federal and <b>state</b> <b>environmental</b> officials rushed to the scene to monitor health hazards from the blaze, which caused the evacuation of a nearby neighborhood due to fire and the closure of two elementary schools due to smoke dangers. Burning debris fell on the towns of Lackawanna and Hamburg. The fire was contained but still burning on the morning of November 10, requiring the continued evacuation of the neighborhood and the schools.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} states without {{wetlands}} laws on their books still have other <b>state</b> <b>environmental</b> laws dealing with water quality or natural resources, and they may already provide substantial authority to regulate wetlands. However, a comprehensive picture of states' ability to protect wetlands, under various possible authorities, is difficult to draw together. To {{fill in the gap}} left by removal of some federal regulatory jurisdiction, states could adopt more comprehensive wetlands regulatory statutes or wetland amendments to state pollution control statutes (possibly including independent water quality certification programs) and rules. The latter, for example, could integrate wetlands, water quality, and watershed management. States do not have the constitutional constraints that the federal government does in enacting legislation (whether a legislative action exceeds Congress' power under the Commerce Clause). Also, CWA section 404(t) expressly provides that the existence of section 404 does not preempt state law governing the discharge of dredged or fill material. However, whether states will take steps to expand wetlands protection in response to the Court's decision raises difficult political and resource questions. It is quite likely that, among states, the SWANCC decision pleases some states and is opposed by others.|$|E
