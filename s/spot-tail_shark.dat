5000|$|Carcharhinus sorrah J. P. Müller & Henle, 1839 (<b>spot-tail</b> <b>shark)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>spot-tail</b> <b>shark</b> {{spends the}} day near the seabed {{and the night}} at the surface, most {{frequently}} around reefs. It is a predator and feeds on bony fish such as bonito and sea bass, cephalopods and crustaceans.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spot-tail</b> <b>shark</b> {{is found}} in the {{tropical}} Indo-Pacific on continental and insular shelves commonly to a depth of about 73 m but possibly as deep as 140 m. Its range extends from the East African coast, Madagascar and the Red Sea to India, Malaysia, China, the Philippines and northern Australia.|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{vital rate}} and life-history data {{essential}} for sustainable harvest management are rare in tropical fisheries. Two commercially important shark species, Australian blacktip (Carcharhinus tilstoni) and <b>spot-tail</b> (C. sorrah) <b>sharks</b> in northern Australia {{have changed in}} size and population status over the last 25 years. These populations were exploited heavily from the early 1970 s to the mid- 1980 s by foreign fishers, and since then have been harvested by a relatively small domestic fishery. We examined the differences in fork length of these species caught in 1983 - 1985 and 2002 - 2006 using Bayesian forms of generalised linear and mixed-effects models. We found clear regional differences and changes in size over time. For blacktips, sharks from the Gulf of Carpentaria have become smaller, and those from the western Northern Territory, larger over time. For <b>spot-tail</b> <b>sharks,</b> average size increased from the 1980 s in the Gulf of Carpentaria, {{but not in the}} western Northern Territory. On average, sharks from the Gulf of Carpentaria were larger than those on the west coast of the Northern Territory, and females were larger than males. We suggest that changes over time and between regions in the size of <b>spot-tail</b> <b>sharks</b> are most likely due to over-exploitation in the past and subsequent recovery of populations. We discuss the uncertainty in trends for blacktip sharks in relation to fishing effort, availability of resources and species identification errors. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Understanding spatio-temporal {{patterns}} in shark occurrence {{is critical for}} assessing the ecological role of a species, its vulnerability to human impacts and environmental change, and the efficacy of conservation and management strategies. Investigating these patterns can also {{develop an understanding of}} the functioning of coastal shark nurseries. In this context, we undertook a multi-year fisheries-independent survey of shark occurrence along a 400 -km stretch of tropical coastline. Logistic regression was used to identify spatial, seasonal and inter-annual variations in the occurrence of neonate and young-of-the-year (YOY) blacktip Carcharhinus limbatus/Carcharhinus tilstoni, pigeye Carcharhinus amboinensis, scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini and <b>spot-tail</b> Carcharhinus sorrah <b>sharks.</b> Results indicated interspecific variations in occurrence. Seasonal variations characterised the occurrence of YOY pigeye, YOY spot-tail and neonate blacktip sharks, whereas spatial variations were more pronounced for YOY blacktip and scalloped hammerhead sharks. These results suggested that the occurrence of young sharks may be more complex than would be predicted by the timing of parturition alone. In addition, spatial heterogeneity in occurrence suggested that proximate bays are likely to vary in terms of the services they provide to young sharks...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>spot-tail</b> <b>shark,</b> or sorrah shark (Carcharhinus sorrah), is {{a species}} of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, found in the {{tropical}} Indo-West Pacific ocean between latitudes 31° N and 31° S, from the surface {{to a depth of}} generally about 72 m. This shark grows to about 1.6 m. It is fished commercially over much of its range and the IUCN considers it to be [...] "near threatened".|$|E
5000|$|The <b>spot-tail</b> <b>shark</b> {{is caught}} by line and gillnet {{in many parts}} of its range by small scale {{commercial}} fisheries. The flesh is used for food, the liver for vitamins, the fins for shark fin soup and the offal for fish meal. The IUCN has listed this shark as being [...] "near threatened" [...] as it suffers from over-fishing throughout much of its range and many populations seem to be in decline. The fisheries in northern Australia are relatively well managed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spot-tail</b> <b>shark</b> is {{viviparous}} with a {{yolk sac}} placenta, giving birth {{once a year}} to a litter of one to eight live young. The gestation period is ten months and the pups measure about 50 cm at birth. The young develop in shallow inshore waters. They grow rapidly at first, increasing in length by about 20 cm during their first year but growth slows down thereafter. Females reach sexual maturity at {{two to three years}} and live for a maximum of seven years while males live up to five years.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spot-tail</b> <b>shark</b> is a {{spindle-shaped}} fish {{growing to}} about 1.6 m. It has a fairly long, pointed snout and moderately large eyes. The first dorsal fin {{is large and}} curved while the second dorsal fin is small and low. The back and sides are grey and the belly white, {{and there is a}} long white streak on the flank. This species can be distinguished from other requiem sharks found in tropical waters by the distinctive black tips to the second dorsal fin, the pectoral fins and the lower lobe of the caudal fin. There is a ridge over the spine extending from the first to the second dorsal fin and a pit {{just in front of the}} upper lobe of the caudal fin. The upper teeth are serrated, oblique and triangular. The Australian blacktip shark (Carcharhinus tilstoni), which occupies a similar range, has similar black tips to the fins but additionally has a black tip to its first dorsal fin. It lacks the ridge between the two dorsal fins and its upper teeth are also different, being slender, upright and pointed.|$|E
40|$|On 5 th June 2013, unusual {{landing of}} the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), the <b>spot-tail</b> <b>shark</b> (Carcharhinus sorrah), the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) and the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) {{belongs to the}} family Carcharhinidae was {{observed}} at Sassoon dock (Fig. 1). About 4 tonnes of sharks of the above species in the length range of 1. 5 – 3. 25 m and weight ranging from 50 to 120 kg were landed by trawler...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{microsatellite}} DNA markers {{were isolated}} in the <b>spot-tail</b> <b>shark</b> (Carcharhinus sorrah) and nine were isolated in Australian black-tip shark (Carcharhinus tilstoni). These loci plus 18 others developed for sharks from the genera Negaprion, Ginglymostoma, Carcharodon and Isurus were tested for amplification success on four species of Carcharhinus (including C. sorrah and C. tilstoni) and four other species representing three diverse families. Cross-amplification was most common within families. Five loci were subsequently tested for polymorphism on 50 C. sorrah and 60 C. tilstoni. The number of alleles per locus was two to 24 and the average heterozygosity was 0. 54 (range 0. 16 - 0. 87) for C. sorrah and 0. 64 (range 0. 44 - 0. 78) for C. tilstoni. These loci may be useful tools for genetic analyses of the Carcharhinidae...|$|E
40|$|This stock {{assessment}} provides detailed {{results for the}} most common sharks encountered by Queensland commercial fishers. These sharks come from the whaler (Carcharhinidae) and hammerhead (Sphyrnidae) families and comprise sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon taylori and R. oligolinx), the milk shark (R. acutus), the creek whaler (Carcharhinus fitzroyensis), the hardnose shark (C. macloti), the <b>spot-tail</b> <b>shark</b> (C. sorrah), the Australian blacktip shark (C. tilstoni), the common blacktip shark (C. limbatus), the spinner shark (C. brevipinna), bull and pigeye sharks (C. leucas and C. amboinensis), the winghead shark (Eusphyra blochii), the scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and the great hammerhead (S. mokarran). Reef sharks were excluded because fishery observer data {{indicated that they were}} largely spatially segregated from sharks caught in the inshore net fisheries. The three common species of reef sharks in Queensland, which are all whaler sharks, are the grey reef shark Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, the blacktip reef shark C. melanopterus and the whitetip reef shark Triaenodon obesus...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the life}} history of an {{exploited}} fish species {{is an integral}} part of successful fisheries management and this information can be used in quantitative population assessments. The present study describes the quantitative relationships among age, growth and reproductive biology of two commercially exploited sharks from the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), namely, the <b>spot-tail</b> <b>shark,</b> Carcharhinus sorrah (n = 659) and the Australian blacktip shark, C. tilstoni (n = 512). Longevity estimates based on vertebral ageing were 9 and 14 years for male and female C. sorrah and 13 and 15 years for C. tilstoni. However, an age-validation study failed to validate annual banding in larger individuals, suggesting that maximum age may be underestimated by vertebrae. C. sorrah grew to adult size relatively fast, reaching maturity at 2. 3 – 2. 4 years, whereas C. tilstoni grew slower, reaching maturity at 5. 2 – 6. 1 years. For both species, however, reproduction did not commence until approximately a year after maturity, at 3. 4 years for C. sorrah and 7. 2 years for C. tilstoni. The results of the present study suggest that in the GBRWHA, C. tilstoni, in particular, begins reproducing at an older age and lives longer than previously thought...|$|E
40|$|The {{status of}} five species of commercially {{exploited}} sharks within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) and south-east Queensland {{was assessed using}} a data-limited approach. Annual harvest rate, U, estimated empirically from tagging between 2011 and 2013, was compared with an analytically derived proxy for optimal equilibrium harvest rate, U-MSY(Lim). Median estimates of U for three principal retained species, Australian blacktip shark, Carcharhinus tilstoni, <b>spot-tail</b> <b>shark,</b> Carcharhinus sorrah, and spinner shark, Carcharhinus brevipinna, were 0. 10, 0. 06 and 0. 07 year(⁻¹), respectively. Median U for two retained, non-target species, pigeye shark, Carcharhinus amboinensis and Australian sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon taylori, were 0. 27 and 0. 01 year(⁻¹), respectively. For all species except the Australian blacktip the median ratio of U/U-MSY(Lim) was 1. Harvest of the Australian blacktip shark above U-MSY could place this species at {{a greater risk of}} localised depletion in parts of the GBRMP. Results of the study indicated that much higher catches, and presumably higher U, during the early 2000 s were likely unsustainable. The unexpectedly high level of U on the pigeye shark indicated that output-based management controls may not have been effective in reducing harvest levels on all species, particularly those caught incidentally by other fishing sectors including the recreational sector...|$|E
40|$|Although {{fish fauna}} in the Arabian/Persian Gulf {{have been studied}} for decades, shark {{diversity}} has only been recently investigated in the region. Here, we present a first comprehensive account of shark diversity from the United Arab Emirates based on fishery-dependent data collected at market and landing sites {{over a two-year period}} of field sampling. Landings across the country were dominated by carcharhinids, and six species were found to be most abundant, including the <b>spot-tail</b> <b>shark,</b> Carcharhinus sorrah, and the milk shark, Rhizoprionodon acutus, contributing 31. 8 % and 29. 9 %, respectively, {{of the total number of}} sharks. While observed landings varied among regions and across seasons, results showed that shark landings were dominated by small-sized species, which may be a reflection of overexploitation. We are now expanding the existing checklist of shark species in the Persian Gulf from 27 to 31, having utilized both morphological identification and genetic barcoding in validating the existence of the grey bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium griseum; the tawny nurse shark,Nebrius ferrugineus; the silky shark, Carcharhinus falciformis; and the sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus, in these waters. This inventory provides an urgently needed assessment of current regional diversity patterns that can now be used as a baseline for future investigations evaluating the effect of fisheries on shark populations. Results emphasize the need for research on life history traits of the various species in order to determine their regional conservation status, but also reveal that a precautionary approach to conservation will be necessary to mitigate anthropogenic impacts...|$|E
