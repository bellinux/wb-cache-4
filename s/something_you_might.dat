500|$|The {{ceremony}} was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new {{mood in the}} United Kingdom: it [...] "had barely finished before {{it had become a}} byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this {{was the most important thing}} he took away from the Olympic experience: [...] "How important it is to believe in <b>something.</b> <b>You</b> <b>might</b> make a fool of yourself and people will go, 'How can you believe in that, you stupid idiot?' But if you believe in something, you carry people with you." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 31, 2015, Billboard premiered a remix of {{the song}} by Dutch DJ Don Diablo, who changed the ballad into an EDM track. Another set of remixes were {{released}} later as a Remix EP. Two of the remixes were released on Madonna's Tidal streaming account, including one by DJ RedTop as well as Armand Van Helden, Offer Nissim and Roger Sanchez. According to Idolator, [...] "RedTop completely deconstructs 'Ghosttown' and turns it into <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> hear in a post-apocalyptic piano bar. It's sad and depressing yet defiantly groovy." [...] Another remix, by Paul Andrews, gave emphasis on Madonna's vocals while adding piano and orchestra in the production. Andrews explained that the music video of [...] "Ghosttown" [...] was how he had imagined it, [...] "two people in a dark place with destruction all around them, but they have each other". Hence he wanted the verse to represent {{the reality of the}} situation and the chorus would represent their view of the world because of their love. The non-dance remix was approved by Madonna and was another exclusive release to her Tidal account.|$|E

5000|$|Participating in Down Beat' s Blindfold Test {{shortly after}} the album's release, composer-arranger Clare Fischer was played track #7, [...] "Agra." [...] A {{longtime}} admirer and student of Ellington's work, Fischer had no trouble identifying the artist, awarding the track five stars, citing both [...] "Duke's immensely creative writing" [...] and his inexplicable ability to transcend [...] "this same old tired instrumentation of trumpets, trombones and saxophones," [...] while [...] "perfectly utilizing the men's specific sounds." [...] In addition, Fischer praised Ellington's ability to [...] "take an exotic-sounding idea and create <b>something</b> - <b>you</b> <b>might</b> call it sophisticated crudity. It gives both qualities that I look for - an earthy quality and the sophisticated quality." ...|$|R
6000|$|She was touched--she was pained; but it {{had already}} {{occurred}} to her that she might do something better than say so.

There is <b>something</b> else <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have that <b>you</b> don't look at--something better than I am. That is a reality!"

5000|$|The cover version {{received}} favorable reception {{from most}} music critics. Bradley Stern from MuuMuse was particularly positive off the collaboration, stating [...] "Happily, the result sounds exactly like <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{expect to hear}} on one of Ayu’s Ayu-mi-x Euro-dance compilations. It’s surging, non-stop nostalgic throwback — for both artists involved, really." [...] Because Hamasaki's version was released only as a digital download, it was made ineligible to chart on the Oricon Singles Chart, but it charted on the Japan Billboard Charts. The song peaked at number thirty-six on the Japan Hot 100 chart.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{had just}} gone through an {{experience}} that made me write this song about like knowing the second you see someone like, 'Oh, {{this is going to}} be interesting.

I think that for me, it was the first time I ever kind of noticed that in myself, like when you are curious about <b>something</b> <b>you</b> know <b>might</b> be bad for you, but you know that you are going to go for it anyway because if you don't, you'll have greater regrets about not seeing where that would go, but I think that for me it all went along with this record that was pushing boundaries, like the sound of this record pushes boundaries, it was writing about something I hadn't written before." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lyrically {{the album}} {{contains}} elements including depressing emotions, anger and recovery. Explaining to MTV, Bennington said: [...] "We don't talk about situations, {{we talk about}} the emotions behind the situations. Mike and I are two different people, so we can't sing about the same things, but we both know about frustration and anger and loneliness and love and happiness, and we can relate on that level." [...] In the same interview, Shinoda explained it as: [...] "What we really wanted to do was just push ourselves and push each other to really find new ways to be creative." [...] He continued: [...] "We wanted each sample that was in each song to be something that might perk your ear - <b>something</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not have ever heard before." ...|$|R
2500|$|In January 2013, Ryan stated, [...] "It's {{going to}} be a CBS procedural. We're going to solve a case every week, but we're going to do it with a lot of humor and a lot of fun. And I would say the stealth thing I would like to get in is, in a day and age when income {{inequality}} and class inequities dominate a lot of the country, this is {{going to be}} an opportunity to put a young working-class kid in Detroit in the middle of Beverly Hills, you can do a lot of stealth social commentary. My approach is to update it and make it feel modern and 2013. The pilot opens with a 4-5 minute sequence which I think is really harrowing and really dangerous, that would be <b>something</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have seen on Chicago Code or The Shield. I want it to feel grounded in that way. There'll be some opportunities for laughs after that. It's not a laughs come first show." ...|$|R
5000|$|Puggy has toured {{all over}} the world, opening for prestigious bands such as Smashing Pumpkins, Incubus, and Deep Purple. Their first album, Dubois Died Today, was {{released}} on independent label Talkieo in June 2007. In 2010, they appeared on the French television show Taratata, presented by Nagui, to promote their follow-up album, <b>Something</b> <b>You</b> <b>Might</b> Like. They also performed live on Belgian television. The album resulted in three music videos, for the songs [...] "I Do", [...] "When You Know" [...] and [...] "How I Needed you".

5000|$|In 2007, {{referring}} to the International Biographical Centre, the American Biographical Institute, {{as well as the}} far longer-lived Marquis Who's Who, Jan Margosian, consumer information coordinator for the Oregon Department of Justice, lumped all biographical reference volumes together in a [...] "warning to consumers" [...] to be wary and called all such companies [...] "pretty tacky", adding that [...] "I don't know why they would put you in there if they weren't hoping to get you to buy the book.

50|$|Adults make {{credibility}} judgments {{based on}} two factors: expertise and trustworthiness. For example, we might trust information from published research articles more than information from blogs {{because we know that}} anyone can write a blog, but scientists (experts) who write peer-reviewed articles are highly trained. With regards to trustworthiness, adults are less likely to believe someone who they think is trying to deceive them, and they take into account the intentions of the information-provider. For example, if someone’s intention is to sell you <b>something,</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be more skeptical of the accuracy of the information they provide because their motives cause you to question their honesty. Adults can effectively use these cues to make judgments about the credibility of different sources, but whether children can also do so is an important area for research.|$|E
5000|$|A. O. Scott of The New York Times {{also gave}} a {{positive}} review, writing, [...] "There is <b>something</b> remarkable - <b>you</b> <b>might</b> even say miraculous - {{about the way}} Higher Ground makes its gentle, thoughtful way across the burned-over terrain of the American culture wars. The film, directed with disarming grace and sharp intelligence by Vera Farmiga (who also stars in it), is about the conflict between skepticism and religious faith, {{but it does not}} treat that battle as an either/or, winner-take-all proposition. Movies about belief and believers frequently succumb to woozy piety or brittle contempt, but Higher Ground belongs, along with Robert Duvall's The Apostle and Michael Tolkin's under appreciated Rapture among the elect." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{seems like}} another rather odd way to {{introduce}} a chapter {{that is supposed to}} be about historicising legal theory, whatever that is. Yet it is precisely everything about this chapter and its place in this book. OK, so <b>you</b> <b>might</b> think that history {{has something to do with}} legal theory and that that is <b>something</b> completely different. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> think that legal theory is completely different from law - if so, we clearly have some way to go in this book. In this chapter we invite you to experience a very different way into thinking legally, immersing you into the known and the unknown, in order to find out how much our non-legal worlds - our NLDBs - affect legal interpretation and legal thinking. And that is something completely different from anything you would possibly expect from a book about legal theory, even an extravert one like this...|$|R
