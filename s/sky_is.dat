Weather depiction plots show ceiling height (level where {{at least half the}} <b>sky</b> <b>is</b> covered with clouds) in hundreds of feet, present weather, and cloud cover. Icing maps depict areas where icing can be a hazard for flying. Aviation-related maps also show areas of turbulence.|$|E

5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the <b>sky</b> <b>is</b> blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E
5|$|Many of the stelae that K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I erected became prototypes for monuments {{raised by}} his successors. The first stela raised, Stela 25, is the king's inaugural monument, and it {{established}} the precedent for the niche style. This type of stela features the newly installed king in a small hollow and seated on an intricately decorated scaffold, being symbolically lifted into the air. On Stela 25, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I is seated on a jaguar cushion, reached by a ladder covered in bloody footprints, symbolizing sacrifice. The cushion itself is raised on a reed effigy. The king is covered by a canopy that is symbolic of the sky; crowning the <b>sky</b> <b>is</b> a great celestial bird, an avian version of the Maya god Itzamna.|$|E
5|$|Orientation {{behaviour}} {{studies have}} been traditionally carried out using variants of a setup known as the Emlen funnel, which consists of a circular cage with the top covered by glass or wire-screen so that either the <b>sky</b> <b>is</b> visible or the setup is placed in a planetarium or with other controls on environmental cues. The orientation behaviour of the bird inside the cage is studied quantitatively using the distribution of marks that the bird leaves {{on the walls of}} the cage. Other approaches used in pigeon homing studies make use of the direction in which the bird vanishes on the horizon.|$|E

Somerset Maugham; Lucy Crown, an adaptation of the novel by Irwin Shaw; and Motive. In 1978, while touring England and Ireland in productions of Motive, Baker met stage actor Donald Burton, who became her third husband. She also appeared in American stage productions of Georges Feydeau's 13 Rue de l'Amour, Forty Carats, and Goodbye Charlie.|$|E
5|$|Taurus {{is a big}} and {{prominent}} constellation in the northern hemisphere's winter sky, between Aries {{to the west and}} Gemini to the east; to the north lie Perseus and Auriga, to the southeast Orion, to the south Eridanus, and to the southwest Cetus. In September and October, Taurus is visible in the evening along the eastern horizon. The most favorable time to observe Taurus in the night <b>sky</b> <b>is</b> during the months of December and January. By March and April, the constellation will appear to the west during the evening twilight.|$|E

5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the <b>sky</b> <b>is</b> one of the more important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, cloud cover {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. The circle in the middle of the station model represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the shape is a triangle. If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating sky cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the ceiling height in hundreds of feet. The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the <b>sky</b> <b>is</b> covered by clouds.|$|E
5|$|Beneath a Steel <b>Sky</b> <b>is</b> a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. The player uses a point-and-click interface {{to interact with}} the environment and to guide protagonist Robert Foster through the game's world. To solve puzzles and progress in the game, the player collects items that may be combined with one another, used on the environment, or given to non-player characters (NPCs). The protagonist converses with NPCs via dialogue trees to learn about the game's puzzles and plot. Clues and other information are obtained by clicking on items in the inventory and on objects in the environment. Unlike in most adventure games at the time, the protagonist's death is possible, after which the player starts from the last save point. In the remastered iOS version, the point-and-click interface is replaced with a touch user interface, a hint system is added, and hotspots are highlighted.|$|E

5|$|The {{inclination}} of {{a planet}} tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit lies. In the Solar System, the reference plane is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic. For extrasolar planets, the plane, known as the sky plane or plane of the <b>sky,</b> <b>is</b> the plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight from Earth. The eight planets of the Solar System all lie {{very close to the}} ecliptic; comets and Kuiper belt objects like Pluto are at far more extreme angles to it. The points at which a planet crosses above and below its reference plane are called its ascending and descending nodes. The longitude of the ascending node is the angle between the reference plane's 0 longitude and the planet's ascending node. The argument of periapsis (or perihelion in the Solar System) is the angle between a planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star.|$|E
