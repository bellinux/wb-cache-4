5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) <b>sense</b> <b>strand</b> and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) <b>sense</b> <b>strand</b> and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) <b>sense</b> <b>strand.</b> Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) <b>sense</b> <b>strand</b> and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E
25|$|The non-template (<b>sense)</b> <b>strand</b> of DNA {{is called}} the coding strand, because its {{sequence}} {{is the same as}} the newly created RNA transcript (except for the substitution of uracil for thymine). This is the strand that is used by convention when presenting a DNA sequence.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of siRNAs in RNAi is largely dependent on its binding ability to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Binding of the duplex siRNA to RISC {{is followed by}} unwinding and cleavage of the <b>sense</b> <b>strand</b> with endonucleases. The remaining anti-sense strand-RISC complex can then bind to target mRNAs for initiating transcriptional silencing.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{satellite}} viruses - viruses {{that require the}} assistance of another virus to complete their life cycle - are also known. Thei taxonomy {{has yet to be}} settled. The following four genera have been proposed for positive <b>sense</b> single <b>stranded</b> RNA satellite viruses that infect plants - Albetovirus, Aumaivirus, Papanivirus and Virtovirus. A family - Sarthroviridae which includes the genus Macronovirus - has been proposed for the positive <b>sense</b> single <b>stranded</b> RNA satellite viruses that infect arthropods.|$|R
5000|$|Viruses in {{the family}} Reoviridae have genomes {{consisting}} of segmented, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Because of this, replication occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm and the virus encodes several proteins which are needed for replication and conversion of the dsRNA genome into (+)-RNAs. The virus can enter the host cell via a receptor on the cell surface. The receptor is not known but is thought to include sialic acid and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). [...] The virus is partially uncoated by proteases in the endolysosome, where the capsid is partially digested to allow further cell entry. The core particle then enters the cytoplasm by a yet unknown process where the genome is transcribed conservatively causing an excess of (+) <b>sense</b> <b>strands,</b> which are used as mRNA templates to synthesize (−) <b>sense</b> <b>strands.</b> Viral particles begin to assemble in the cytoplasm 6-7 hours after infection.Translation takes place by leaky scanning, suppression of termination, and ribosomal skipping. The virus exits the host cell by monopartite non-tubule guided viral movement, cell to cell movement, and existing in occlusion bodies after cell death and remaining infectious until finding another host.|$|R
25|$|The alphaviruses are small, spherical, enveloped viruses with a genome of {{a single}} {{positive}} <b>sense</b> <b>strand</b> RNA. The total genome length ranges between 11,000 and 12,000 nucleotides, and has a 5’ cap, and 3’ poly-A tail. The four non-structural protein genes are encoded in the 5′ two-thirds of the genome, while the three structural proteins are translated from a subgenomic mRNA colinear with the 3′ one-third of the genome.|$|E
25|$|Only {{one of the}} two DNA strands {{serve as}} a {{template}} for transcription. The antisense strand of DNA is read by RNA polymerase from the 3' end to the 5' end during transcription (3' → 5'). The complementary RNA is created in the opposite direction, in the 5' → 3' direction, matching the sequence of the <b>sense</b> <b>strand</b> with the exception of switching uracil for thymine. This directionality is because RNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing mRNA chain. This use of only the 3' → 5' DNA strand eliminates the need for the Okazaki fragments that are seen in DNA replication. This also removes the need for an RNA primer to initiate RNA synthesis, {{as is the case in}} DNA replication.|$|E
500|$|In eukaryotes, {{two primary}} models for how {{homologous}} recombination repairs double-strand breaks in DNA are the double-strand break repair (DSBR) pathway (sometimes called the double Holliday junction model) and the synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) pathway. In {{the case of}} double strand breakage, the 3' end is degraded and the longer 5' end invades the contiguous sister chromatid, forming a replication bubble. As this bubble nears the broken DNA, the longer 5' antisense strand again invades the <b>sense</b> <b>strand</b> of this portion of DNA, transcribing a second copy. When replication ends, both tails are reconnected to form two Holliday Junctions, which are then cleaved {{in a variety of}} patterns by proteins. An animation of this process can be seen [...]|$|E
50|$|Due to inverted, {{complementary}} long terminal repeats (LTRs) at {{each end}} of the genome, a T shaped secondary structure is formed. The complementary areas leave a 3' hydroxyl group single stranded for the replication to begin. This 3' hydroxyl group is used as a primer for the leading strand synthesis. Both positive and negative <b>sense</b> <b>strands</b> of DNA are made. Double stranded intermediates are formed throughout the replication; this means the two strands, positive and negative sense, will be matched up.|$|R
50|$|Short interfering RNA (siRNA) {{is a very}} {{powerful}} new tool that can interfere with and silence the expression of specific disease gene. To improve cellular uptake of siRNA, CPP strategies have been applied to facilitate the delivery of siRNA into cells through either covalent or non-covalent linkages. In one study, siRNA is covalently linked to transportan and penetratin by disulfide-linkage at 5’-end of the <b>sense</b> <b>strands</b> of siRNA to target luciferase or eGFP mRNA reporters. In another study, TAT-siRNA conjugate through a stable thiomaleimide linkage at 3’-end of siRNA was delivered into HeLa cells for eGFP gene silencing.|$|R
50|$|Cis-acting {{replication}} elements {{brings together}} the 5' and 3' ends during replication of positive <b>sense</b> single <b>stranded</b> RNA viruses (for example Picornavirus, Flavivirus, coronavirus, togaviruses, Hepatitis C virus) and double stranded RNA viruses (for example rotavirus and reovirus).|$|R
500|$|Exogenous dsRNA initiates RNAi by {{activating}} the ribonuclease protein Dicer, which binds and cleaves double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) in plants, {{or short}} hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in humans, to produce double-stranded fragments of 20–25 base pairs with a 2-nucleotide overhang at the 3' end. Bioinformatics {{studies on the}} genomes of multiple organisms suggest this length maximizes target-gene specificity and minimizes non-specific effects. These short double-stranded fragments are called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These siRNAs are then separated into single strands and integrated into an active RISC, by RISC-Loading Complex (RLC). RLC includes Dicer-2 and R2D2, and is crucial to unite Ago2 and RISC. TATA-binding protein-associated factor 11 (TAF11) assembles the RLC by facilitating Dcr-2-R2D2 tetramerization, which increases the binding affinity to siRNA by 10-fold. Association with TAF11 would convert the R2-D2-Initiator (RDI) complex into the RLC. R2D2 carries tandem double-stranded RNA-binding domains to recognize the thermodynamically stable terminus of siRNA duplexes, whereas Dicer-2 the other less stable extremity. Loading is asymmetric: the MID domain of Ago2 recognizes [...] the thermodynamically stable end of the siRNA. Therefore, the [...] "passenger" [...] (<b>sense)</b> <b>strand</b> whose 5′ end is discarded by MID is ejected, while the saved [...] "guide" [...] (antisense) strand cooperates with AGO to form the RISC.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{reported}} method of methylation analysis using bisulfite-treated DNA utilized PCR and standard dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing to directly determine the nucleotides resistant to bisulfite conversion. [...] Primers {{are designed to}} be strand-specific as well as bisulfite-specific (i.e., primers containing non-CpG cytosines such that they are not complementary to non-bisulfite-treated DNA), flanking (but not involving) the methylation site of interest. [...] Therefore, it will amplify both methylated and unmethylated sequences, in contrast to methylation-specific PCR. [...] All sites of unmethylated cytosines are displayed as thymines in the resulting amplified sequence of the <b>sense</b> <b>strand,</b> and as adenines in the amplified antisense strand. [...] This technique required cloning of the PCR product prior to sequencing for adequate sensitivity, and therefore was a very labour-intensive method unsuitable for higher throughput. [...] Alternatively, nested PCR methods can be used to enhance the product for sequencing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Programmed {{mutagenesis}} is a DNA {{computing system}} that uses cycles of DNA annealing, ligation, and polymerization to implement programatic rewriting of DNA sequences. We report that programmed mutagenesis is theoretically universal by showing how Minsky’s 4 -symbol 7 -state Universal Turing Machine [11] {{can be implemented}} using a programmed mutagenesis system. Each step of the Universal Turing Machine is implemented by four cycles of programmed mutagenesis, and progress is guaranteed {{by the use of}} alternate <b>sense</b> <b>strands</b> for each rewriting cycle.

5000|$|The two {{complementary}} {{strands of}} double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are usually differentiated as the [...] "sense" [...] strand and the [...] "antisense" [...] strand. The DNA <b>sense</b> <b>strand</b> {{looks like the}} messenger RNA (mRNA) {{and can be used}} to read the expected protein code; for example, ATG in the sense DNA may correspond to an AUG codon in the mRNA, encoding the amino acid methionine. However, the DNA <b>sense</b> <b>strand</b> itself is not used to make protein by the cell. It is the DNA antisense strand which serves as the source for the protein code, because, with bases complementary to the DNA <b>sense</b> <b>strand,</b> it is used as a template for the mRNA.
