50|$|In 1973, {{a tighter}} {{monetary}} policy made this arrangement less profitable, but Wells Fargo {{saw an opportunity}} in the new interest limits on <b>passbook</b> <b>savings.</b> When the allowable rate increased to 5%, Wells Fargo {{was the first to}} begin paying the higher rate. The bank attracted many new customers as a result, and within two years its market share of the retail savings trade increased more than two points, a substantial increase in California's competitive banking climate. With its increased deposits, Wells Fargo was able to reduce its borrowings from the Federal Reserve, and the 0.5% premium it paid for deposits was more than made up for by the savings in interest payments. In 1975, the rest of the California banks instituted a 5% <b>passbook</b> <b>savings</b> rate, but they failed to recapture their market share.|$|R

Penalties are levied for redemption before maturity. 3. Christmas (holiday) clubs. Usually little or not interest is paid on "club " accounts. Major advantages, however, are reinforcement of systematic savings with weekly coupon books and the ability to save small weekly amounts. 4. Corporate bonds.

The swordsman reveals that he is Fubukimaru, the heir of the castle Kasukabe, which was destroyed due to Unkokusai's attacks. Fubukimaru's parents, the lord and lady of the castle, were killed by Unkokusai, and her sister was kidnapped by him. She recounts the prophecy, [...] "When the castle fell into crisis, 3 heroes and a dog appeared, to save everyone from crisis and ruin", and seeks {{the cooperation of the}} Nohara family and Shiro, believing them to be the [...] "3 heroes and a dog".

50|$|In Communist Romania, CEC {{created a}} number of types of accounts, {{including}} <b>passbook</b> <b>savings</b> accounts with various combinations of interest and prizes, and opened branches throughout Romania. From 1970 to 1985, CEC made housing loans as well. After the 1989 revolution, CEC began activities such as granting loans to other banks and dealing in government securities. In 1996, Law No. 66 reorganized CEC as a joint-stock company with the Finance Ministry as its sole shareholder. Beginning in 2005, moves were made toward privatization. A 2006 attempt at privatization was cut short when the government was dissatisfied with the bids. The possibility of privatization has been in play as recently as January 2011.|$|R
40|$|Well-functioning {{financial}} services are key for consumption smoothing {{and to take}} advantage of investment opportunities. Even though poor households badly need {{financial services}} for their day-to-day money management, a commonly held view is that they are ‘too poor’ to save and to repay loans with flexible terms. This paper explores whether this view holds true for two specific flexible financial products, namely <b>passbook</b> <b>savings</b> accounts and credit lines. Analyzing the daily transactions and balances in more than 10, 000 SafeSave accounts—a microfinance institution based in Dhaka, Bangladesh—over nine years (2004 - 2012) shows that clients make extensive use of their flexible savings-and-loan accounts to accommodate changing availability of and needs for liquidity in the face of three kinds of events: paydays, Islamic festivals (Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha), and political protests (hartals). Cash-in (savings deposit and loan repayment) flexibility is used to cope with both positive (paydays) and negative shocks (Islamic festivals and political protests); cash-out (withdrawal and loan taken) flexibility is used if the negative shock is anticipated well in advance (as in the case of Islamic festivals). We show that, while interest rates on loans are higher than in competing MFIs, repayment rates are comparably high. We also show that SafeSave is covering its operational costs, indicating that this type of flexible financial services can be offered to the poor in a sustainable fashion. Overall, analysis of the SafeSave experience shows that flexible financial products are much in demand by the poor and that they can be profitable for the microfinance institution that offers them. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{research}} on financial services in low-income countries has focused on micro-credit programs. Much less {{attention has been paid to}} the design of depository services, although many more low-income people use depository services than get access to credit. Having access to depository services is important for household well-being: to safeguard funds, to save for large purchases, and as insurance against unexpected expenditures. Economic reform programs in recent years have encouraged banks to push up nominal interest rates to keep deposit rates positive in real terms, and to motivate savings in financial assets. But once deposit rates are positive in real terms, banks typically increase minimum deposit size or find other ways to discourage small depositors because of the high costs of maintaining and servicing low-balance accounts. Traditional <b>passbook</b> <b>savings</b> accounts, the main product used by low-income households, are being phased out because of high costs. After South Africa's move to democracy in 1994, it was politically imperative that the country's major financial institutions help redress the historically weak system of services for low-income people. The authors describe one of the more interesting experiments. In 1993 Standard Bank of South Africa created an affiliate, called E Bank, to deliver basic banking services to the urban poor. E Bank provides a package of financial services designed specifically for low-income clients, offering greater convenience for the user while keeping under control the costs to the bank of providing services. E Bank combines the innovative technology of modified ATM services with staff available to help all clients. By rethinking the needs of the basic banking customer, E Bank was able to bundle services valued by poorer clients to justify a fee high enough to cover costs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} and compare the impact of the flow of deposits on the balance sheets of the mutual savings banks (MSBs) and the savings and loan associations (SLAs) of New York State (NYSTATE). They were compared to each other for the years 1966 to 1980 with a 1981 update. The State was divided into two sections, NYCITY, basically the New York City SMSA plus Nassau and Suffolk counties and NYOTHER, the balance of the State. These were also compared to each other. ^ A substantial review of the literature investigated 5 major commissions and studies. Major industry problems were also examined. Finally the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 was examined and summarized. ^ It was hypothesized that the two subareas of each institution would have different reactions to the same influences, and also that the two thrifts would have different reactions. The statistical tool was a correlation coefficient analysis with 60 data points. ^ Chapter 3 analyzed the liability accounts. Chapter 4 analyzed asset account management, including a discussion of liquidity. Chapter 5 analyzed net worth as a proxy for profit. The balance sheet accounts were compared for relationships to the flow of deposits, the market place yields, and to each other. ^ The major findings for these chapters can be summarized as follows: (1) the MSBs and SLAs are not different in their reactions except in their asset management; (2) that the inflows have not 2 ̆ 2 suffered 2 ̆ 2 from high interest rates; (3) that mortgage loans were not terribly affected until 1980, only the rate of increase was affected; (4) there has been an increasing sensitivity of deposit flows to interest rates; (5) the liquidity ratios have improved, but the improvement is deceptive; (6) that regular <b>passbook</b> <b>savings</b> held up in NYOTHER until 1979. ^ The evidence presented supports the hypothesis that NYCITY will have different reactions than will NYOTHER to the same type of influences with each type of thrift institution. ^ The evidence presented supports the hypothesis that the two types of institution of NYSTATE will have different reactions to the same type of influences. ^ There is a major public policy issue pinpointed by this study. The thrifts have been historically viewed as separate and distinct institutions which react differently and which are viewed as different by the public. The evidence does not confirm this. The liability accounts did not support the hypotheses. Should the regulators, the legislatures, and the various banking authorities continue to view them as separate. This study suggests that they do not do so and regulate for them as if they are identical and equal. ...|$|R
