5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a <b>single</b> <b>grain</b> thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|The {{geologic}} formations {{that have}} the most influence on the Everglades are the Miami Limestone and the Fort Thompson Formation. The Miami Limestone forms {{the floor of the}} lower Everglades. The Miami Limestone is made up of ooids: tiny formations of egg-shaped concentric shells and calcium carbonate, formed around a <b>single</b> <b>grain</b> of sand. The Miami Limestone was formerly named the Miami Oolite, which comprises facies of ooids and fossilized bryozoan organisms. The unique structure was some of the first material used in housing in early 20th-century South Florida. The composition of this sedimentary formation affects the hydrology, plant life, and wildlife above it: the rock is especially porous and stores water during the dry season in the Everglades, and its chemical composition determines the vegetation prevalent in the region. The Miami Limestone also acts as a dam between Fort Lauderdale and Coot Bay.|$|E

Unpeated malt is almost always used, the main exception being Connemara Peated Malt whiskey. There are several types of whiskey common to Ireland: single malt, <b>single</b> <b>grain,</b> blended whiskey and pure pot still whiskey.|$|E
25|$|Once {{inserted}} into a TEM, the sample {{has to be}} manipulated to locate the region {{of interest to the}} beam, such as in <b>single</b> <b>grain</b> diffraction, in a specific orientation. To accommodate this, the TEM stage allows movement of the sample in the XY plane, Z height adjustment, and commonly a single tilt direction parallel to the axis of side entry bolders. Sample rotation may be available on specialized diffraction holders and stages. Some modern TEMs provide the ability for two orthogonal tilt angles of movement with specialized holder designs called double-tilt sample holders. Some stage designs, such as top-entry or vertical insertion stages once common for high resolution TEM studies, may simply only have X-Y translation available. The design criteria of TEM stages are complex, owing to the simultaneous requirements of mechanical and electron-optical constraints and specialized models are available for different methods.|$|E

40|$|Identification {{of astronomical}} dust {{composition}} rests on comparison of Infrared (IR) spectra with standard laboratory spectra; frequently, however, a single mineralogical composition is assumed for spectral matching. Advances in laboratory instrumentation have enabled very precise IR spectra {{to be measured}} on <b>single</b> <b>grains</b> and zones within grains; with a more complete set of spectral data for planetary dust, better compositional matches will be achieved for astronomical dust. We have compared several FT–IR spectroscopy techniques (open path transmission spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy of powders; microspectroscopy of <b>single</b> <b>grains</b> and powders and ATR spectroscopy of thin sections) to determine their utility for the direct measurement of the mid-IR spectra of small amounts of extraterrestrial grains. We have focussed our investigation on the spectra of the olivine series of silicates, (Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4, a species frequently identified {{as one of the}} major constituents of interstellar dust. The positions of three characteristic SiO 4 stretching bands at 10. 4, 11. 3 and 12 μm were measured for comparison of the techniques. All methods gave satisfactory results, although care must be taken to guard against artefacts from sample thickness and orientation effects. <b>Single</b> <b>grains</b> hand-picked from meteorites can be analysed, but results are inaccurate if the grain size is too large (> 1 – 10 μm). Spectra for <b>single</b> <b>grains</b> also show variations that arise from sample orientation effects.

2500|$|The first {{unambiguous}} {{consequence of}} the existence of stardust within meteorites came from the laboratory of Edward Anders in Chicago, who found using traditional mass spectrometry that the xenon isotopic abundances contained within an acid-insoluble carbonaceous residue that remained after the meteorite bulk had been dissolved in acids matched almost exactly the predictions for isotopic xenon in red giant stardust. It then seemed certain that stardust grains were contained within Anders' acid-insoluble residue. Finding the actual stardust grains and documenting them was a much harder challenge that required locating the grains and showing that their isotopes matched those within the red-giant star. [...] There followed a decade of intense experimental searching in the attempt to isolate individual grains of those xenon carriers. But what was really needed to discover stardust was a new type of mass spectrometer that could measure the smaller number of atoms in a <b>single</b> <b>grain.</b> Sputtering ion probes were pursued by several laboratories in the attempt to demonstrate such an instrument.

40|$|AbstractSurface {{formation}} for three-body abrasion {{is essentially}} {{more difficult to}} model than for two-body abrasion. In contrast to grains embedded in the polishing pad and therefore time-invariant tool geometry for two-body abrasion, here a variable tool geometry is prevailing {{as a result of}} the rolling abrasive grains. Nevertheless, three-body abrasion is an important abrasive process in the surface finishing of glass and ceramics and the modelling of the surface formation for mechanical abrasive machining with loose grains is required for a better process understanding and enhanced process design. The modelling of the surface formation for three-body abrasion is dealt with by splitting the integral removal volume under the polishing pad into the removal of <b>single</b> <b>grains</b> and distributing the total polishing force according to the interaction of individual grains with the workpiece material. This new methodical approach intends to determine the material removal in discrete time steps for every grain and further on the generated new surface topography. Data from polishing experiments like concentration and form of abrasives, polishing load, surface topography and integral removal are applied to set up this analytic-empiric model. Crucial elements of this model are the geometry of <b>single</b> <b>grains,</b> their rolling motion under load and the principle of material removal.
