After a methionine methyl ester-induced disruption of lysosomes and two density gradient centrifugations we obtained a homogeneous membrane fraction and another one enriched in particulate inclusions. The latter exhibited a yellow-brown coloration and contained bodies lacking a delimiting membrane, which were characterised by a granular pattern and high electron density. The lipofuscin-like inclusion materials were rich in tripeptidyl peptidase I, β-glucuronidase, acid ceramidase and apolipoprotein D and contained proteins originating from diverse <b>subcellular</b> <b>localisations.</b> Here we show that human term placenta contains lipofuscin-like lysosomal inclusions, a phenomenon usually associated with senescence in postmitotic cells. These findings imply that a simple pelleting of a lysosomal lysate is not appropriate for the isolation of lysosomal membranes, as the inclusions tend to be sedimented with the membranes...|$|R

The finding that these proteins are often deregulated or mutated in diseases such as cancers and diabetes, together with their potential as clinical therapeutic targets, has further highlighted the necessity for understanding the signaling functions of these important proteins. The mechanisms of RTK regulation and function have been recently reviewed by Lemmon & Schlessinger (2010) but in this review we instead focus on the results of several recent studies that show receptor tyrosine kinases can function from <b>subcellular</b> <b>localisations,</b> including in particular the nucleus, in addition to their classical plasma membrane location.

50|$|PIPKs {{are today}} {{divided into three}} groups, type I, II and III that share {{significant}} sequence homology but differ in the substrate specificities, <b>subcellular</b> <b>localisations</b> and functions.Type 1 are PIPKs that phosphorylate PtdIns4P to PtdIns(4,5)P2 and are called PtdIns4P 5-kinases because they phosphorylate on the D-5 hydroxyl group. Type II PIPKs phosphorylate PtdIns5P at the D-4 site and are called PtdIns5P 4-kinases. And finally PIPKs of type III are PtdIns3P 5-kinases that phosphorylate PtdIns to PtdIns(3,5)P2, which prototype is Fab1 in yeast (see http://jcs.biologists.org/content/vol114/issue12/images/large/JCS8533F1.jpeg for descriptive picture). The substrate specificity of type I and II depends on the so-called activation loop. The activation loop is a segment of 22 to 27 amino acid residues, located close to the C-terminal end of the catalytic domain in all PIPKs. When the activation loops of a type I and a type II PIPK were swapped, the chimera with type I backbone showed specificity for type II substrate, and vice versa for the other chimera.|$|R

In line with their diverse <b>subcellular</b> <b>localisations</b> ranging from the ER (SPP, SPPL 2 c), the Golgi (SPPL 3), the plasma membrane (SPPL 2 b) to lysosomes/late endosomes (SPPL 2 a), the different members of the SPP/SPPL family seem to exhibit distinct functions.

Several methods {{have led to}} the assignment of proteins to specific <b>subcellular</b> <b>localisations</b> by partial separation of organelles across a fractionation scheme coupled with computational analysis. Methods developed to analyse organelle data have largely employed supervised machine Assignment learning algorithms to map unannotated abundance profiles to known protein-organelle associations. Such approaches are likely to make association errors if organelle-related groupings present in experimental output are not included in data used to create a protein-organelle classifier. Currently, there is no automated way to detect organelle-specific clusters within such datasets. In order to address the above issues we adapted a phenotype discovery algorithm, originally created to filter image-based output for RNAi screens, to identify putative subcellular groupings in organelle proteomics experiments. We were able to mine datasets to a deeper level and extract interesting phenotype clusters for more comprehensive evaluation in an unbiased fashion upon application of this approach. Organelle-related protein clusters were identified beyond those sufficiently annotated for use as training data.

We have analysed the significance of sequence identities observed after structure alignment and provide statistical evidence that these beta-trefoil proteins are all homologues, having arisen from a common ancestor. In addition, we have explored the sequence space of all beta-trefoil proteins and have determined that the actin-binding proteins fascins, and other proteins of unknown function, are beta-trefoil family homologues. Unlike other beta-trefoil proteins, the triplicated repeats {{in each of the four}} beta-trefoil domains of fascins are significantly similar in sequence. This hints at how the beta-trefoil fold arose from the duplication of an ancestral gene encoding a homotrimeric single-repeat protein. The combined analysis of structure and sequence databases for detecting significant similarities is suggested as a highly sensitive approach to determining the common ancestry of extremely divergent homologues...|$|R

Human and Drosophila SALL proteins are modified by Sumo, which influences their subnuclear localisation. Here, we analyse the transcriptional activity of Drosophila Sall proteins in cultured cells.

Furthermore, using the UAS/Gal 4 heterologous system, Drosophila Sal and Salr repress transcription in human cells.

Interestingly, GG neurons display an atypical mammalian olfactory morphology with neurons bearing deeply invaginated cilia mostly covered by ensheathing glial cells. We had previously noticed their morphological resemblance with the chemosensory amphid neurons found in the anterior region of the head of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). We demonstrate here further molecular and functional similarities. Thus, we found an orthologous expression of molecular signalling elements that was furthermore restricted to similar specific <b>subcellular</b> <b>localisations.</b> Calcium imaging also revealed a ligand selectivity for the methylated thiazole odorants that amphid neurons are known to detect. Cellular responses from GG neurons evoked by chemical or temperature stimuli were also partially cGMP-dependent.

The results revealed associations with membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, mobile granules, small round structures (1 - 2 &# 181;m in diameter) and chloroplasts. Expression of mRFP-TGB 2 in epidermal cells enabled cell-to-cell movement of a TGB 2 defective PMTV reporter clone, indicating that the mRFP-TGB 2 fusion protein was functional and required for cell-to-cell movement. Protein-lipid interaction assays revealed an association between TGB 2 and lipids present in chloroplasts, consistent with microscopical observations where the plastid envelope was labelled later in infection. To further investigate the association of PMTV infection with chloroplasts, ultrastructural studies of thin sections of PMTV-infected potato and Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by electron microscopy revealed abnormal chloroplasts with cytoplasmic inclusions and terminal projections. Viral coat protein, genomic RNA and fluorescently-labelled TGB 2 were detected in plastid preparations isolated from the infected leaves, and viral RNA was localised to chloroplasts in infected tissues.

We expressed different isoforms of Tensin 2 and their individual domains as recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP) -fusion constructs in DU 145 human prostate cancer cells. Under fluorescence confocal microscopy, the isolated domains of Tensin 2 all displayed discrete distributions throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In particular, partial constructs containing the C 1 domain localised preferentially to the nucleus, including the isolated C 1 domain and the PTPase domain. In contrast, all three full-length isoforms of Tensin 2 were present exclusively in discrete punctate bodies throughout the cytoplasm. This punctate staining showed colocalisation with the tumour suppressor protein DLC- 1 {{as well as with}} actin (phalloidin). Furthermore, DU 145 cells transiently expressing partial Tensin 2 constructs containing the PTB domain showed an increased haptotactic migration. In addition, stimulation of renal carcinoma cells stably expressing Tensin 2 by the survival factor Gas 6 caused phosphorylation of its receptor Axl, but no effect on Tensin 2, which was already maximally phosphorylated at time 0.
