500|$|At the Ipatiev House, Olga and {{her sisters}} were {{eventually}} required {{to do their own}} laundry and learned how to make bread. The girls took turns keeping Alexandra company and amusing Alexei, who was still confined to bed and suffering from pain after his latest injury. Olga was reportedly deeply depressed and lost a great deal of weight during her final months. [...] "She was thin, pale, and looked very sick", recalled one of the guards, Alexander Strekotin, in his memoirs. [...] "She took few walks in the garden, and spent most of her time with her brother." [...] Another guard recalled that the few times she did walk outside, <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> [...] "gazing sadly into the distance, making it easy to read her emotions." [...] Later, Olga appeared angry with her younger sister Maria for being too friendly to the guards, reported Strekotin. After late June, when a new command was installed, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the guards and the conditions of their imprisonment became even more stringent.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Penniman, as I say, {{had stopped}} short; and <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{with her eyes}} fixed brilliantly on her companion.|$|E
6000|$|MRS BUILDER, who {{has so far}} {{seemed to}} {{accompany}} him, shuts the door [...] quickly and remains in the studio. <b>She</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> with that faint [...] smile on her face, looking at the two young people.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> to-day--legislation [...] Has {{failed to}} remove her. The trains [...] No longer pull {{up at that}} station; [...] And over the ghastly remains [...] Of the army that waited and died of [...] old age fall the snows and the rains.|$|R
2500|$|Arshtat is an assayer of deeds at the Chinvat bridge, {{the bridge}} of {{judgement}} that all souls must cross. in Bundahishn (37.10â€“14), Arshtat plays this role together with the Amesha Spenta Ameretat, of whom Arshtat is a hamkar [...] "co-operator"; and in the Book of Arda Wiraz (5.3), <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> with Mithra, Rashnu, Vayu-Vata, and Verethragna.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> realizing her deliverance, {{with the}} dark and tragic glory of her eyes passing from her father to Duane.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{blushing}} before him, {{over her}} cheeks and up to her forehead; but yet did not turn away her face.|$|E
60|$|While <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> a buggy came {{driving up}} the lane and wheeled about at the steps. In it was Spencer Morgan.|$|E
6000|$|... "See," [...] screamed Emlyn; [...] "did I {{not tell}} you that Harflete's seed should live to be avenged upon all your tribe, and <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> who will bear it? Now where shall we shelter till England hears this tale? Cranwell is down, though it shall rise again, and Shefton is stolen. Where shall we shelter?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, British {{archaeologist}} Mortimer Wheeler {{described the}} item as his favorite statuette:"She's about {{fifteen years old}} I should think, not more, but <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> with bangles {{all the way up}} her arm and nothing else on. A girl perfectly, for the moment, perfectly confident of herself and the world. There's nothing like her, I think, in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|I saw poor Ellen {{kneeling}} still, [...] So pale! I guessed not why: [...] 325 [...] When <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> up, <b>there</b> plainly was [...] A {{trouble in}} her eye.|$|R
60|$|Still she was silent. He {{watched her}} dark figure as <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{on the edge}} of the faint darkness, and he waited.|$|E
60|$|One tense moment <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> {{lightning}} scorn {{and passion}} in her gaze, {{and then she}} rushed out, impetuously, as she had come.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{making this}} magnificently extravagant claim; her eyes blazing blue, her hair a little dishevelled with a strand across her cheek.|$|E
6000|$|... "Run!" [...] I cried to the girl, as I {{bent and}} seized my rifle. But <b>she</b> only <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> at my side, her bared blade ready in her hand.|$|R
60|$|We are {{not sure}} that Miss Diana is not {{thinking}} of him quite {{as much as he}} of her, as <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> with the long kitchen shovel in one hand, and one plump white arm thrust into the oven, and her little head cocked on one side, her brows bent, and her rosy mouth pursed up with a solemn sense of the importance of her judgment as she is testing the heat of her oven.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned to}} her directly. If I had {{received}} a musket-ball in the heart, and <b>she</b> had <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> I almost believe I should have {{turned to her}} before I dropped.|$|R
60|$|For {{three days}} <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> till every hearth in Rome was alight, {{and then she}} was {{suffered}} to go where she would.|$|E
60|$|Lady Janet {{advanced}} {{no further}} than the threshold. <b>She</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> and looked at her nephew and her adopted daughter in stern silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "It 's Angela," [...] she cried, and <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{waiting and}} listening, smiling at Bernard, with her {{handkerchief}} pressed to her lips.|$|E
60|$|At 1 o'clock {{when the}} hod-carriers were making ready {{to close up}} the front and keep the inside open, a woman slips {{in the door of}} the {{restaurant}} and comes up to Old Jack's table. You've seen the kind--black shawl, creepy hair, ragged skirt, white face, eyes a cross between Gabriel's and a sick kitten's--the kind of woman that's {{always on the lookout for}} an automobile or the mendicancy squad--and <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> without a word and looks at the money.|$|R
2500|$|A bronze {{statuette}} {{dubbed the}} [...] "Dancing Girl", [...] high and about 4,500 years old, {{was found in}} 'HR area' of Mohenjo-daro in 1926. In 1973, British archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler described the item as his favorite statuette:"She's about fifteen years old I should think, not more, but <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> with bangles {{all the way up}} her arm and nothing else on. A girl perfectly, for the moment, perfectly confident of herself and the world. There's nothing like her, I think, in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{you ask me}} to {{help you}} with {{evidence}} against her?' the girl murmured. <b>She</b> had <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> passive, waiting while he talked, covering her face with her hands, which she parted a little, looking at him.|$|R
6000|$|Madame Merle {{dropped her}} eyes; <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{in a kind}} of proud penance. [...] "You're very unhappy, I know. But I'm more so." ...|$|E
60|$|Margaret Maynard knew <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> in the flesh, yet {{the shimmering}} white satin, the flowing veil, covered some {{one who was}} a {{stranger}} to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you like}} it?" [...] Cyril asked, turning round to her full face and {{fronting}} her as <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> all beautiful blushes through her creamy white skin.|$|E
50|$|In Ju-on Kobayashi {{is claimed}} by Kayako {{during his visit}} to the house. As he watches her crawl down the stairs he backs up to the door which opens from behind him. <b>She</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there,</b> says his name, then comes down and gives him a kiss of death. When the angle changes Kayako is gone, Kobayashi is sitting there dead, and Toshio is still {{standing}} facing forward with a phone in his hand and his mouth open. In The Grudge, Peter kills himself by throwing himself over his balcony in front of his wife.|$|R
60|$|There she stands-painted by herself. No witness but {{herself has}} been allowed to testify. <b>She</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> painted by her acts, and {{decorated}} by her words. When she talks, she has only a decorative value as a witness, either for or against herself, for she deals mainly in unsupported assertion; and in the rare cases where she puts forward a verifiable fact she gets out of it a meaning which it refuses to furnish to anybody else. Also, when she talks, she is unstable, she wanders, she is incurably inconsistent; what she says to-day she contradicts tomorrow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Leave us, Sylvia, please," [...] she said. [...] "Forgive me, dear. But you {{see they}} will not mention these things while you are present." [...] She made a piteous little figure as <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> {{trembling}} <b>there,</b> her fingers tearing in agitation at one of Samoval's roses.|$|R
60|$|As <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> hesitating, Ramdass came out. He {{was a man}} of some {{forty years}} of age, with a {{pleasant}} and kindly face. He looked at her enquiringly.|$|E
60|$|He {{opened his}} fingers. She {{turned her head}} away. It seemed to him an eternity that <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there.</b> When she spoke her voice was {{scarcely}} more than a whisper.|$|E
60|$|He {{was still}} looking at her as <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> before him meeting his gaze {{steadily}} and unafraid. He felt the hot passion of his love mounting higher and higher.|$|E
6000|$|... [He {{goes to his}} daughter, {{and they}} pass out. FERRAND remains [...] at the picture. MRS. MEGAN dressed in some of ANN's {{discarded}} [...] garments, {{has come out of}} the model's room. She steals up [...] behind FERRAND like a cat, reaches an arm up, and curls it [...] round his mouth. He turns, and tries to seize her; she [...] disingenuously slips away. He follows. The chase circles the [...] tea table. He catches her, lifts her up, swings round with [...] her, so that her feet fly out; kisses her bent-back face, and [...] sets her down. <b>She</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> smiling. The face at the [...] window darkens.] ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{seemed to}} Hoopdriver {{that he heard}} her sob. <b>She</b> <b>stood</b> dimly <b>there,</b> holding her machine, and he, holding his, could go no nearer to her {{to see if she}} sobbed for weeping or for want of breath. [...] "What are we to do now?" [...] her voice asked.|$|R
60|$|Angela {{did nothing}} {{whatever}} {{to defend herself}} against this ingenious sally; <b>she</b> simply <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> in graceful abstraction. Bernard was vaguely vexed at her neither looking at him nor speaking to him; her indifference seemed a contravention of that right of criticism which Gordon had bequeathed to him.|$|R
