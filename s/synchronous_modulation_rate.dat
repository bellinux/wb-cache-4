40|$|When stimulated {{with complex}} action {{potential}} sequences synapses exhibit spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with modulated pre- and postsynaptic contributions to long-term synaptic modifications. In order {{to investigate the}} functional consequences of these contribution dynamics (CD) we propose a minimal model formulated in terms of differential equations. We find that our model reproduces data from to recent experimental studies with {{a small number of}} biophysically interpretable parameters. The model allows to investigate the susceptibility of STDP to arbitrary time courses of pre- and postsynaptic activities, i. e. its nonlinear filter properties. We demonstrate this for the simple example of small periodic modulations of pre- and postsynaptic firing rates for which our model can be solved. It predicts synaptic strengthening for <b>synchronous</b> <b>rate</b> <b>modulations.</b> Modifications are dominant in the theta frequency range, a result which underlines the well known relevance of theta activities in hippocampus and cortex for learning. We also find emphasis of specific baseline spike rates and suppression for high background rates. The latter suggests a mechanism of network activity regulation inherent in STDP. Furthermore, our novel formulation provides a general framework for investigating the joint dynamics of neuronal activity and the CD of STDP in both spike-based as well as rate-based neuronal network models. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{advancement}} in power electronics devices like Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) {{has increased the}} low voltage ac drive to the medium voltage drive system. These IGBTs have higher voltage capability. For eliminating the harmonic content three level converters are chosen rather than two level converters. But these inverter switches using IGBTs should be operated in low switching frequency so that the huge loss associated with switching loss is reduced to large extent. When switching frequency is low then conventional asynchronous modulation technique is not appropriate because {{of the formation of}} sub-harmonic components. Therefore, it is wise to apply <b>synchronous</b> <b>modulation</b> technique. Programmed Modulation is one of best <b>synchronous</b> <b>modulation</b> technique which pre-calculates the optimum switching angles. If those switching angles are calculated by minimizing total harmonic contents then it is called <b>Synchronous</b> Optimal <b>Modulation.</b> These optimized PWM strategies are extremely difficult to realize with conventional analog circuitry, but they can be effectively implemented in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) which has extremely fast computation capability and allows a few microseconds real-time computation of complex control algorithms. FPGA is a microchip which consists of matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLB) made up of flip flops and lookup tables. VHDL is Hardware Descriptive Language which is utilized to synthesize hardware designs in FPGA. VHDL creates digital circuitry, which performs operations in parallel so FPGA is extremely fast and performs various time critical tasks in the system.

The existence of the MFB suggests that a certain form of the spectral analysis of any acoustic signal envelope may be performed in the auditory system after initial filtering in the auditory filter bank.

40|$|Sensitivity to {{interaural}} time differences (ITDs) conveyed in the temporal fine structure of low-frequency tones and the modulated envelopes of high-frequency sounds are considered comparable, particularly for envelopes shaped to transmit similar fidelity of temporal information normally present for low-frequency sounds. Nevertheless, discrimination performance for envelope <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> above {{a few hundred}} Hertz {{is reported to be}} poor—to the point of discrimination thresholds being unattainable—compared with the much higher (> 1, 000 ?Hz) limit for low-frequency ITD sensitivity, suggesting the presence of a low-pass filter in the envelope domain. Further, performance for identical <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> appears to decline with increasing carrier frequency, supporting the view that the low-pass characteristics observed for envelope ITD processing is carrier-frequency dependent. Here, we assessed listeners’ sensitivity to ITDs conveyed in pure tones and in the modulated envelopes of high-frequency tones.

Here, by using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) optimized for studying the auditory system, we report the existence of a topographically ordered spatial representation of temporal sound <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> in human auditory cortex. We found a topographically organized sensitivity within auditory cortex to sounds with varying <b>modulation</b> <b>rates,</b> with enhanced responses to lower <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> (2 and 4  Hz) on lateral parts of Heschl's gyrus (HG) and faster <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> (16 and 32  Hz) on medial HG.

While accurate rate estimation yields better rate-selection decisions and increased throughput, those methods must still choose between a handful of <b>modulation</b> <b>rates.</b> Each <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> is effective {{in a range of}} actual signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) but the limited number of practical rates means that transmitters are often forced to “step down ” to a lower data rate despite having a higher SNR than the minimum required for that lower rate. In this paper we describe, evaluate and implement a practical multiuser communication scheme that exploits these discrete “steps” in <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> to transmit two packets in the time normally needed to transmit a single packet, increasing aggregate throughput precisely when it is most needed- when the network is busy and suffers from rate unfairness. Because the method transmits a group of packets simultaneously, we call this scheme Group Rate Transmission with Intertwined Symbols, or GRaTIS. In addition to up to 120 % improvement in network throughput achieved by GRaTIS, the technique is backward compatible with 802. 11 and doesn’t require complex DSP algorithms as required by competing methods...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that multisensory integration may occur at an early phase in sensory processing and within cortical regions traditionally though to be exclusively unisensory. Evidence from perceptual and electrophysiological studies indicate that the cross modal temporal correspondence of multisensory stimuli plays {{a fundamental role in}} the cortical integration of information across separate sensory modalities. Further, oscillatory neural activity in sensory cortices may provide the principle mechanism whereby sensory information from separate modalities is integrated. In the present study we aimed to extend this prior research by using the steady-state EEG response (SSR) to examine whether variations in the cross-modality temporal correspondence of amplitude modulated auditory and vibrotactile stimulation are apparent in SSR activity to multisensory stimulation. To achieve this we varied the cross-modal congruence of <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> for passively and simultaneously presented amplitude modulated auditory and vibrotactile stimuli. In order to maximise the SSR response in both modalities 21 and 40 Hz <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> were selected.

The first experiment investigated peristimulus adaptation of the FFR for pure and complex tones {{as a function of}} stimulus frequency and fundamental frequency (F 0).
