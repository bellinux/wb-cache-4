Small fine grasses especially <b>sheep's</b> <b>fescue,</b> with fine-leaved <b>sheep's</b> <b>fescue,</b> hard fescue, squirrel-tail fescue, early hair-grass. Herbs include sheep's sorrel, mouse-eared hawkweed, cat's ear and yarrow.|$|R
50|$|Grass types present include {{perennial}} rye, <b>sheep's</b> <b>fescue,</b> sweet vernal, and timothy.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed {{on various}} grasses, such as <b>sheep's</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca ovina), smooth {{meadowgrass}} (Poa pratensis), and wheat (Triticum aestivum).|$|R
50|$|The main {{species of}} grass is upright brome (Bromus erectus), though {{tor-grass}} (Brachypodium pinnatum) is also common. In areas of heavy grazing, <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca ovina) and meadow oat-grass (Helictotrichon pratense) can take over. Blue sedge (Carex flacca), spring sedge (Carex caryophyllea), dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), burnet saxifrage (Pimpinella saxifraga), and devil’s bit (Succisa pratensis) are also common.|$|E
50|$|The area's dry and nutrient-poor {{sandy soil}} {{provides}} a habitat for numerous endangered {{plants such as}} the sea thrift, childing pink and wild thyme. The dominant species is <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue.</b> Other rare plants include filago and the hairgrass Corynephorus canescens. The grassland provides nesting for various birds, among them the woodlark, the skylark and the titlark. Leaving the paths is prohibited during the nesting season from April to July, dogs must be kept on a short leash. A herd of Heidschnucken sheep keeps the grass short.|$|E
50|$|Revegetation {{should be}} a part of any medusahead {{management}} plan. If medusahead is not first controlled, reseeding an infested area will not be successful. The existing medusahead has to be controlled and especially not allowed to produce more seed, and the seed bank in the soil also has to be reduced. This usually takes two or three years, depending on soil moisture and growing conditions. After this, seedling of desirable species can become established. Combining a tillage treatment followed by herbicide is most effective in controlling the weed and promoting desirable plant growth. Squirreltail, bluebunch wheatgrass, crested wheatgrass, intermediate wheatgrass, Thurber's needlegrass, needle and thread, Indian ricegrass, sandberg bluegrass, and <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> are all competitive grasses that work well when renovating an area previously infested with medusahead in the western United States.|$|E
50|$|There is grazing to {{maintain}} the short-grassland areas {{in the north and}} east of the site and <b>sheep's</b> <b>fescue</b> is prominent.|$|R
50|$|The larva feeds at {{the roots}} of various grasses {{including}} tussock grasses, orchard grass, ryegrass, reed grasses, and <b>fescues</b> such as <b>sheep's</b> <b>fescue.</b> This species overwinters as a larva.|$|R

50|$|This grass often {{occurs at}} high elevations. It {{can be found}} in alpine climates. It grows in several habitat types, usually in cool, dry areas. It is a {{dominant}} species in a number of regions throughout its range, growing in forest and woodland understory; it is an indicator species for a number of forest understory types. It occurs at elevations above Arizona fescue but below <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue,</b> with some overlap. It is more often a dominant grass at high elevations than the latter. It is associated with forests of quaking aspen in much of its region. In this habitat it can form a dense, tall, productive understory. In the Rocky Mountains it often begins its growth under the snowpack, producing chlorotic leaves until it encounters sunlight. Some meadows and grasslands are dominated by this species.|$|E

50|$|Tan spot {{is found}} {{primarily}} on wheat, {{but is also}} found to infect other cereals and grasses including triticale, barley, and rye, but are less frequently affected.Other grass species effected by the pathogen include Siberian wheat grass, sand bluestem, meadow brome, <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue,</b> June grass, little bluestem, green foxtail, needle and thread, and tall wheatgrass.While these are not necessarily agriculture crop hosts such as wheat, the pathogen is able to form and survive on many grass hosts, which can eventually venture into wheat fields. Other important grass susceptible hosts include smooth brome {{which can be found}} in pastures, as well as quack grass that is found in the environment and considered a weed in many agricultural crops. Lesions typically appear on both upper and lower leaf surfaces, and initially are tan to brown specks. Eventually, the tan to brown specks expand to larger irregular, oval, lens-shaped, ellipse, tan blotches with a yellow ring around them. The yellow ring {{is often referred to as}} a halo, yellow discoloration as chlorosis, and browning/death of leaf tissue as necrosis. The development of a dark brown to black spot in the center the lesion is characteristic of the disease. If warmer temperatures and moist conditions persist, spores known as conidia will move up plant as secondary inoculum and can also infect head/spikes. Symptoms on the head are indistinct, but can cause brownish glumes, and grains can have a reddish appearance similar to the pathogen Fusarium.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sheep's</b> <b>fescue</b> is a densely tufted {{perennial}} grass. Its greyish-green {{leaves are}} short and bristle-like. The panicles are both slightly feathery {{and a bit}} one-sided. It flowers from May until June, and is wind-pollinated. It has no rhizomes.|$|R
40|$|Wildlife: <b>Sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> {{provides}} {{very little}} cover for hiding or nesting habitat. Erosion control/reclamation: The primary use of <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> is ground cover. It {{is ideal for}} stabilization of disturbed soils because of its dense root system. Its low growth form and low maintenance requirements make it ideal for ground cover purposes. It is commonly used to protect roadsides, airport landing strips, industrial and residential areas, ditch and canal banks, skid trails, clear cuts, ski hills, camp sites and other recreation areas from erosion. It provides excellent cover and erosion control in areas between trees rows of shelterbelts, windbreaks and tree farms. <b>Sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> withstands moderate equipment traffic and requires minimal maintenance. This makes it useful in vineyards, orchards, and farm equipment yards. Its good drought tolerance combined with strong bunch type root systems and adaptations {{to a variety of}} soils make this species ideal for reclamation in areas receiving 12 to 24 inches annual precipitation. This grass can be used in areas where irrigation water is limited to provide ground cover. Weed control: <b>Sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> is an excellent weed control species because it has an extensive and dense bunch type root system. Once a good stand is established, it excludes the invasion of most weeds...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to 1) evaluate the establishment and peak standing crop of Berber Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata var. "Berber"), Palestine Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata var. "Palestine"), and <b>Sheep</b> <b>Fescue</b> (Festuca ovina var. "Covar"); 2) to assess establishment and production changes resulting from environmental gradients (elevation, slope, aspect, soil texture, precipitation, and resident annual community) across the foothill landscape; 3) develop a mathematical model that predicts site potential for restoration; and 4) evaluate the utility of Geographic Information Systems for creation and analysis of spatial data which identify site production potential. Sixteen sites were chosen which reflect the general character of the foothill rangelands in southwestern Oregon. A Randomized Complete Block design was used to select treatment arrangement on each site. Seeded treatments received both chemical (Glyphosate, Hoelon, and 2, 4 -D) and mechanical (residue removal) disturbance. Test species were seeded into three replications at each site. Each replication also included a non-treatment control. Standing crop data for test species and resident exotics were collected after three growing seasons. Berber orchardgrass did not establish at most sites and where establishment did take place production was less than 132 kgDM/ha. Palestine orchardgrass established on on {{a majority of the}} study sites and produced most aboveground phytomass at mid-elevations where coarser soil textures and deeper soil depths were common. <b>Sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> was the most successful of the three test species and did best on low elevation high clay sites. There was significantly (P= 0. 001) more phytomass produced by annual exotics on seeded plots than on undisturbed controls at most sites. Both Palestine orchardgrass and <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> treatments significantly suppressed the annual exotics when compared to the Berber treatments. Generally, "Covar" <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> can establish and successfully compete with exotics on heavier textured soils at low elevations.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate early establishment characteristics and germination pattern of fine-textured fescues (FF) under natural room temperature and to analyze differences between alternative and natural conditions for a practical application. Six cultivars from Chewings fescue (CF), creeping red fescue (CRF), hard fescue (HF) and <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> (SF) were evaluated in the study. Daily and cumulative germination pattern were measured and analyzed. Significant differences were greatly observed in germination pattern, days to the first germination, days to 60 % germination, and germination percentage with environments, species and cultivars. Final germination rate was 29. 7 to 80. 0 % under natural conditions. The first germination was initiated between 8 and 10 DAS (days after seeding) under natural conditions, being 3 to 4 days later as compared with ISTA conditions. Days to the 60 % germination were 12. 1 to 19. 0 DAS, being 3. 0 to 4. 2 days slower than that under ISTA conditions. CF ‘Jamestown II ’ was the fastest cultivar, while the slowest CRF ‘Audubon’. Turf establishment speed was faster with CRF < SF < HF and < CF in order.

40|$|Corn (Zea mays L.) stover {{has been}} {{identified}} as an important feedstock for biofuel production but its removal will likely increase soil erosion. To address this issue 35 species of grasses and legumes were evaluated as potential perennial ground covers (PGCs) in corn. Selection of species encompassed both C 3 and C 4 species {{with a wide range of}} developmental and morphological features. The objectives were to (i) identify species that could support a high level of corn production while requiring minimal management and (ii) identify morphological traits and growth habits of suitable entries as PGC. Over the 3 -yr study period species with slow growing and spreading habits were more conducive to corn production, even though these PGCs still caused an average 23 % reduction in corn grain yield. Meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca ovina L.), Canada bluegrass (Poa compressa L.), fowl bluegrass (Poa palustris L.), and colonial bentgrass (Agrostis capillaris L.) were identified as suitable PGC species. These species were generally shorter and slower to spread into the corn rows compared with other, more aggressive species. Based on these observations an ideotype for future PGC species should be low growing, clump forming, and shade tolerant and have delayed green-up in the spring...|$|E

The objective of the research is to assess the potential for revegetation of land affected by surface coal mining in this alpine area. Two plot areas approximately 300 m apart were established on a south-west facing slope to evaluate the suitability of two different "soil materials". These included "coversoil " or the indigenous soil material and "rock spoil" material. A total of 18 plots were established {{at each of the}} two locations to evaluate the suitability of Highlander slender wheatgrass (Agropyron trachycaulum), alpine bluegrass (Poa alpina), broadglumed wheatgrass (Agropyron violaceum), and <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca ovina) for revegetation in this area.

40|$|As {{cities in}} the Intermountain West {{continue}} to grow, water conservation becomes increasingly important. A substantial amount of municipal water is applied to turfgrass. Many lawns are low traffic ground cover and {{do not need to}} be the same high quality as a typical Kentucky bluegrass lawn. This study was designed to evaluate mixes and monostands of native and adapted grasses for their potential as low input turf. Twentyfive mixes and monostands were planted in four replications at Greenville Experimental Farm to be evaluated for color, quality, and cover/uniformity at two nitrogen levels (44 and 88 kg N/ha/yr). Color was evaluated using a hand-held chlorophyll meter and digital analysis of photographs. Quality was evaluated using a visual rating scale of 1 - 9 by a trained evaluator. Cover and uniformity were evaluated using digital analysis and the point-quadrat method. <b>Sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> had the highest visual ratings with ratings near or above 7 for all six months. Tall fescue had ratings no lower than 6 for all six months. Blue grama had ratings at or above 5 for 4 of 6 months.
