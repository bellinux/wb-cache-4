Commencing in the afternoon of 27 November, they began clearing operations between Bonga and North Hill along the coast with a <b>secondary</b> <b>task</b> of sending a company towards Pabu to facilitate the relief of the 2/32nd. In the vicinity, the Japanese 20th Division, consisting of {{the remnants of the}} 79th, 80th and 238th Infantry Regiments, numbered 4,670 men, of which 2,500 were combat effective. The lead company of the 2/28th Infantry Battalion moved off shortly after midday, passing through the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion's lines. Initially there was no opposition and by the afternoon they established a defensive position near a waterfall. The following morning, the advance continued. The ground astride the coastal track, although flat, was covered in dense jungle, which was not suitable for tracked vehicles to move across. The result of this was that the Australian tanks had to remain on the track, advancing behind the infantry, which limited the rate of their advance and prevented them from being able to apply the full weight of their firepower.|$|E

40|$|Distracted driving {{has long}} been {{acknowledged}} {{as one of the}} main contributors to crashes in the US. According to past studies, driving behavior proved to be influenced by the socioeconomic characteristics of drivers. However, only few studies attempted to quantify that influence. The study proposed a Crash Risk Index to estimate the crash risk associated with the socioeconomic characteristics of drivers and their tendency to experience distracted driving. The analysis is conducted using data from the SHRP 2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS). The proposed Crash Risk Index (CRI) is developed based on a grading system of three measures: the crash risk associated with performing <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks</b> during driving, the effect of socioeconomic attributes (e. g. Age) on the likelihood of engagement in <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks,</b> and the effect of specific categories within each socioeconomic attribute (e. g. Age 3 ̆e 60) on the likelihood of engagement in <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks.</b> Logistic Regression analysis was performed on the <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks,</b> socioeconomic attributes, and the specific socioeconomic characteristics. The results identified the significant <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks</b> with high crash risk and the socioeconomic characteristics with significant effect on determining drivers’ involvement in <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks</b> among each tested parameter. These results were used to quantify the grading system measures and hence estimate the proposed CRI. This index indicates the relative crash risk associated with the socioeconomic characteristics of drivers and considering the possibility of engagement in <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks.</b> The proposed CRI and the associated grading system are plausible methods for estimating auto insurance premiums...|$|R

500|$|Like the Allies, the Japanese also {{relied on}} water {{transport}} to ferry supplies and reinforcements around the New Guinea, using {{a force of}} three submarines to avoid interdiction by Allied aircraft which had previously inflicted heavy casualties during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. These submarines were augmented by [...] barges, although they were limited in supply and were subject to attack by Allied aircraft and PT boats. Once the supplies had been landed, resupply parties were used to carry the stores overland on foot along {{a number of key}} tracks to their main troop concentrations around Sattelberg and Finschhafen. Air support was provided by the 4th Air Army, consisting primarily of the 7th Air Division and 14th Air Brigade, along with some elements from the 6th Air Division. Based in Wewak, the Japanese aircraft were mainly used to escort Japanese shipping and attack Allied shipping around the main beachhead during the campaign, with a <b>secondary</b> <b>task</b> of undertaking ground attack missions in support of Japanese troops. The 11th Naval Air Fleet, based at Rabaul, also undertook anti-shipping missions. Despite having these units available, heavy Allied bombing of Japanese airfields around Wewak in August 1943 greatly reduced the number of aircraft available to the Japanese and limited their ability to apply airpower throughout the campaign.|$|E

A {{model of the}} Lae-Salamaua area was constructed in a secure room at St Lucia, the windows were boarded up and two guards were posted on the door round the clock. On 16 May, Blamey held a conference with Berryman and Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring, the commander of I Corps, around the model at which {{the details of the}} operation were discussed. Blamey's operational concept was for a double envelopment of Lae, using [...] "two of the finest divisions on the Allied side". Major General George Wootten's 9th Division would land east of Lae in a shore-to-shore operation and advance on Lae. Meanwhile, Major General George Alan Vasey's 7th Division, in a reprise of the Battle of Buna–Gona in 1942, would advance on Lae from the west by an overland route. Its primary role was to prevent reinforcement of the Japanese garrison at Lae by establishing itself in a blocking position across the Markham Valley. Its <b>secondary</b> <b>task</b> was to assist the 9th Division in the capture of Lae. The plan was generally known as Operation POSTERN, although this was actually the GHQ code name for Lae itself.|$|E

Thus a research area was dedicated to looking into attention selection mechanisms and the willingness of drivers to engage in <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks.</b> This area aims to understand why drivers are distracted and how they adapt when distracted. Video data will be used assessing the situation {{in front of the}} driver as well as identifying safety-critical events. A close view of the driver face is needed to see the gaze direction and a view inside the vehicle to identify whether and which <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks</b> are performed. A smart camera measures the distance to potential crash objects and pedal positions, vehicle speed, longitudinal and lateral accelerometers will be used to identify driver reactions such as avoidance manoeuvres. Positioning data will be used to determine road type and other environmental variables.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} Deft, a new multitask learning {{approach for}} rule learning algorithms. Like other multitask learning systems, the one proposed here {{is able to}} improve learning performance on a primary task {{through the use of}} a bias learnt from similar <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks.</b> What distinguishes Deft from other approaches is its use of rule descriptions as a basis for task similarity. By translating a rule into a feature vector or “description”, the performance of similarly described rules on the <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks</b> can be used to modify the evaluation of the rule for the primary task. This explicitly addresses difficulties with accurately evaluating, and therefore finding, good rules from small datasets. Deft is implemented on top of an existing ILP system and the approach is tested on a variety of relational learning <b>tasks.</b> Given appropriate <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks,</b> the results show that Deft is able to compensate for insufficient training examples. ...|$|R

Just before 14:00 one of the regiment's flank patrols, two miles north-east of Rafa, captured a Turkish officer and three Germans who, during questioning, claimed that the Rafa garrison consisted of 2,000 men, with four mountain artillery guns, and that the 160th Regiment was en route to reinforce the defenders. Another patrol reported that two infantry battalions were heading to Rafa from Abu Khatli, while a third patrol reported that around 2,000 men, about [...] away, were coming from Khan Younis.

50|$|Another set of {{paradigms}} used {{to study}} the P3b are dual task paradigms. There are several variations of the dual task paradigm, {{and they can be}} {{used to study}} cognitive workload (see Kok, 2001). Workload can be defined as the amount of processing resources required for a particular task. In a dual-task paradigm, participants are given two tasks to perform simultaneously; a primary task and a <b>secondary</b> <b>task.</b> Though the primary task can be of virtually any type, the <b>secondary</b> <b>task</b> should involve some traditional P300 paradigm (e.g., an oddball task). When these tasks are performed concurrently, we would expect to see a reduction in P3b amplitude in response to the <b>secondary</b> <b>task</b> if the primary task requires some stimulus evaluation resources. Furthermore, the extent of this reduction is presumed to reflect the amount of workload associated with the primary task. In fact, there should be a reciprocal relationship between the amplitudes of the P3b response elicited by the primary and secondary tasks, respectively. If the primary task is easier (i.e., requires less stimulus evaluation resources), participants have more resources left over to devote to the <b>secondary</b> <b>task.</b> Conversely, if the primary task is harder (i.e., requires more stimulus evaluation resources), participants have less resources left over to devote to the <b>secondary</b> <b>task.</b>|$|E

5000|$|To give an example, {{subjects}} might {{perform a}} primary task, such as tracking a visual object {{on a screen}} with a joystick, concurrently with a <b>secondary</b> <b>task</b> of mentally counting oddballs in an auditory stream. The difficulty of the primary task is usually manipulated in various ways, and the impacts of these manipulations on the P3b response to the <b>secondary</b> <b>task</b> are examined. For example, in one condition subjects might track the one-dimensional movement of an object (only up and down), and in the more difficult condition {{they might have to}} track two dimensional movement (any direction on a computer screen). [...] A motor manipulation like this will typically impact reaction times on the <b>secondary</b> <b>task,</b> but will not impact the P3b response. However, if you increase the demand on working memory or other cognitive resources during the primary task, for example by adding objects to the screen or only having subjects selectively attend to one part of the screen, the amplitude of the P3b in response to oddballs in the <b>secondary</b> <b>task</b> will diminish. The amount that it diminishes can be a measure of how many working memory or stimulus evaluation resources are being used by the primary task.|$|E

40|$|Dingus {{and colleagues}} {{recently}} estimated crash odds ratios (ORs) for “driver behavior errors” (hereafter, “Behaviors”) in the Strategic Highway Research Program Phase 2 naturalistic driving study. Behaviors are illegal, improper, aggressive, and/or reckless driving maneuvers. For example, the Dingus study OR estimate for “Speeding over limit and {{too fast for}} conditions,” (hereafter, “Speeding”), was 12. 8, with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) from 10. 1 to 16. 2. The current study identified four issues in the Dingus study. First, heterogeneous Behaviors were pooled; e. g., “Exceeded speed limit,” and “Exceeded safe speed but not speed limit” were apparently improperly pooled to form Speeding. Second, exposed drivers often had other Behaviors {{in the same time}} window, but unexposed drivers had none, a selection bias that inflated Behavior ORs by 30 %. Third, impairments were not filtered out. Fourth, <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks</b> were not filtered out, creating a confounding bias that deflated Behavior OR estimates by 50 %. To correct these issues, the current study stratified the heterogeneous categories, then filtered out other Behaviors, impairments, and <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks.</b> “Pure Behavior” (no other Behaviors, <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks,</b> or impairments) was thus compared to “Pure Driving” (no Behaviors, <b>secondary</b> <b>tasks,</b> or impairments). The Pure OR estimate for “Exceeded speed limit” was 5. 4 (CI 2. 7 - 10. 1), and for “Exceeded safe speed but not speed limit” was 71. 5 (CI 36. 0 - 136. 2), both substantially different than the Dingus study Speeding estimate.
