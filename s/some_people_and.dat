5|$|Before World WarII, all {{homes were}} {{required}} to display Hinomaru on national holidays. Since the war, the display of the flag of Japan is mostly limited to buildings attached to national and local governments such as city halls; it is rarely seen at private homes or commercial buildings, but <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> companies have advocated displaying the flag on holidays. Although the government of Japan encourages citizens and residents to fly the Hinomaru during national holidays, they are not legally required to do so. Since the Emperor's 80th Birthday on December 23, 2002, the Kyushu Railway Company has displayed the Hinomaru at 330 stations.|$|E
5|$|During this time, St. Anthony, on {{the east}} side, was {{separate}} from Minneapolis, on the west side. As a result of inferior management of the water power, St. Anthony found its manufacturing district declining. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> organizations started to talk about merging the two cities. A citizens' committee recommended merging the two cities in 1866, but a vote on this issue was rejected in 1867. Minneapolis incorporated as a city in 1867. The two cities found themselves competing with St. Paul, which had a larger population, the head of navigation of the Mississippi River, and more access to railroads.|$|E

5|$|Often {{considered}} a poor {{relation of the}} cep (Boletus edulis), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an allergic reaction in <b>some</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I.badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in cider vinegar, wine, or extra virgin olive oil, and later used in sauces or soups.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{quotation}} in the Holly Quran {{from the book}} of Psalms in 21 : 105 : “The righteous shall inherit the earth”. A similar sentence can be found in Psalm 37 : 29 : צַדִּיקִים יִֽירְשׁוּ־אָרֶץ וְיִשְׁכְּנוּ לָעַד עָלֶֽיהָ. A comparison between these verses would illustrate that “صالح” is the Quranic equivalent of the Hebrew word “צַדִּיקִ”. This equivalence would allow us to compare usages of “صالح” in Quran and “צַדִּיקִ” in the book of Psalms. This comparative study will show that: (a) on the one hand, “צַדִּיקִ” has been used in Psalms either as an attribute of God or as a description of <b>some</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>and</b> on the other, “صالح” has been used in Quran for describing either <b>some</b> <b>peoples</b> or their acts, (b) These two words have similar usages in Psalms and Quran {{to the extent that they}} have been used for the description of <b>some</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>and</b> (c) the Quranopsalmic use of this notion can be linked with the concept of “divine selection(istifā) ”...|$|R
25|$|One of {{the more}} debated {{questions}} {{in this regard is}} who had been the teacher of Li Luoneng, the founder of modern Xing Yi Quan. It is known that Li studied with the Dai clan, but remains unclear who taught him. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> lineages have traditionally claimed that he was taught by master Dai Longbang. However, many others point to the fact that Longbang had died before Luoneng was born, or when Luoneng was quite young. Combined with the fact that Luoneng only arrived at Dai territory as a traveling adult, others argue {{that it would have been}} impossible for him to have studied under Longbang, and suggest his teacher was actually Longbang's student, Guo Weihan.|$|E
25|$|On {{their journey}} back to Wu, the fleet passed by Baiwei (白圍), where Lu Xun {{announced}} {{that they would be}} getting off their vessels to go ashore for a hunting expedition. However, he actually gave secret orders to his subordinates Zhou Jun (周峻) and Zhang Liang (張梁) to lead their men to attack Xinshi (新市), Anlu (安陸) and Shiyang (石陽) counties in Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡). Outside Shiyang County, the common people were going about their daily activities in the marketplace when Zhou Jun and his men showed up. The people immediately packed up everything and attempted to rush to safety behind the city walls. The Wei soldiers in Shiyang wanted to close the city gates but the civilians were blocking the way, so they killed <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> forced the gates to be shut. Zhou Jun and his men killed and captured over 1,000 civilians in Shiyang. The captives were resettled in Wu. Lu Xun gave orders to his men, forbidding them from harassing the people. Those captives who had their families with them were given due attention and care while those who lost their loved ones during the raid were provided with food and clothing and treated well before they were sent home. Many people were so touched by Lu Xun's acts of kindness that they decided to move to Wu territory. When news of Lu Xun's kindness spread to the neighbouring regions, two Wei officers, Zhao Zhuo (趙濯) and Fei Sheng (斐生), and a tribal king, Meiyi (梅頤), led their followers to join Lu Xun. Lu Xun generously distributed rewards to them.|$|E

500|$|The game artists {{regularly}} drafted {{variations on}} Tali's face throughout the series' development. BioWare's position {{on whether to}} reveal her face was a long-standing internal debate, and the developers announced they were still unsure during Mass Effect 3s development. Concept artist Matt Rhodes felt it would {{interesting to see how}} players compared her personality to her appearance, and how they would respond to an appearance that challenged their expectations as [...] "a little too alien, just a little too repellant". They were aware that either decision would likely annoy <b>some</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> that no reveal could universally fit all views of Tali. BioWare wished to unveil her face in a [...] "tasteful way" [...] outside of the game engine, and decided that a gift from Tali would be the best way. A stock photo was used to ensure the face's closeness to a real photograph. An in-game photo of Tali's face is available as a gift to the player-character Commander Shepard upon pursuing her Mass Effect 3 romance event tree.|$|E
500|$|The Red Cross {{was criticized}} for claims of skimping on aid given to <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> even racial discrimination.

In Delray Beach, a woman who completely lost her home, said she was given only [...] "a few old pieces of clothes and a few cans of tomatoes and potted meat and a small can of milk for myself and kids." [...] Grace Campbell, a chair of a workers committee, was quoted in The Chicago Defender stating that only 20% of relief was being dispersed to African Americans. A rumor circulated, which even garnered sympathy from Governor Martin, that a black man named Levi Brown was eating ham in a mess tent and was struck {{in the head and}} shoulder with an ax by a Red Cross worker, told him [...] "ham was not for niggers." [...] Brown himself admitted that he was actually assaulted with a meat cleaver in a restaurant. The claims of partiality were refuted by the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and Mary McLeod Bethune in a telegraph to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{appeared}} {{to the justice}} to be a profoundly troubled young man. There was {{no doubt that he}} had killed Chaykoski and Woloch, he had not acted in self-defence and {{there was no evidence of}} provocation; the chances of reducing the murder charge to manslaughter were therefore slim. Nosanchuk felt obliged, in the light of Lamb's psychiatric and personal history, to explore an insanity plea. The lawyer interviewed Yaworsky and Dolan, secured them as witnesses for the trial, and also reviewed a report from four doctors at Penetanguishene who had previously interviewed his client. According to this report, Lamb had been amiable, fluent in his conversation and apparently plausible; he at first claimed amnesia for the events of 25 June, but on continued questioning related what had happened [...] "in detail". He admitted his responsibility but still did not appear to be concerned about what had happened. He did not seem to be able to emotionally appreciate the consequences of his actions, even though he understood on an intellectual level that he had shot at <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> that to do that was wrong. When he told the psychiatrists that he regretted what he had done, they wrote that he [...] "clearly did not have any real underlying feeling of remorse". He also did not appear to have considered that he might be suffering from any illness, mental or otherwise. The Penetanguishene report concluded that Lamb [...] "suffered from a disease of the mind as a pathological anti-social or psychopathic personality", which was a recognised psychiatric disorder under the Criminal Code and therefore grounds for an insanity defence in court.|$|E
