60|$|The princess herself led {{the child}} into {{the room where the}} twenty men were now seated. She stood in the centre of the ring for a moment, looking at one man after another, and then held out the apple to the Shifty Lad, who was {{twisting}} a <b>shaving</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> round his finger, and had the mouthpiece of a bagpipe hanging from his neck.|$|E
60|$|Wetting his hand, he {{took from}} the fire-place a small {{quantity}} of ashes, making them into a paste, and this he rubbed over the freshly cut space until it had been darkened to a shade like unto {{the remainder of the}} flooring, while I, eager to aid in whatsoever of work was being done, picked up carefully each tiny <b>shaving</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> throwing them on the embers that they might be consumed.|$|E
60|$|It came {{more easily}} than I could have expected. I rushed across the room, bearing it with me; but, as I rushed, the {{accident}} of my position put me upon the outer side. Had it been the other way, I might have come off scathless. As it was, there was a moment's pause as I stopped it and tried to pass in through the opening which I had left. That moment was enough to give time to the creature to toss off the coat with which I had blinded him and to spring upon me. I hurled myself through the gap and pulled the rails to behind me, but he seized my leg before I could entirely withdraw it. One stroke of that huge paw tore off my calf as a <b>shaving</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> curls off before a plane. The next moment, bleeding and fainting, I was lying among the foul straw with a line of friendly bars {{between me and the}} creature which ramped so frantically against them.|$|E
50|$|The balafon is {{generally}} {{capable of producing}} 18 to 21 notes, though some are built to produce many fewer notes (16, 12, 8 or even 6 and 7). Balafon keys are traditionally made from béné wood, dried slowly over a low flame, and then tuned by <b>shaving</b> off bits <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> from the underside <b>of</b> the keys. <b>Wood</b> is taken off the middle to flatten the key or the end to sharpen it.|$|R
40|$|This study {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} air quality by measuring gas concentrations, and assess the surface and inside temperatures of deep litter materials in a finishing swine building. The experiment was conducted during the months of June and July. It was compared three treatments: deep litter composed <b>of</b> <b>shaving</b> <b>woods</b> + sugarcane bagasse (M + B), deep litter composed of sugarcane bagasse (BAG) and deep litter consisting <b>of</b> <b>shaving</b> <b>woods</b> (MAR). The installation stalls had a concrete floor under the deep litter. Measurements of instantaneous concentrations of ammonia, NH 3 (ppm), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ppm) and carbon monoxide (CO, ppm) {{at the level of the}} animals were taken. Data relating to surface temperature and inside the deep litter for swine were collected at three different points within the stalls (center, in the frontal region and background of the stalls). It was observed that the "MAR" deep litter showed the highest average concentration of NH 3 (2. 88 ppm). The "BAG" deep litter showed the lowest values of NH 3 for all time intervals evaluated. In the morning period was observed significant differences for all treatments. The highest CO 2 concentration (1530 ppm) was observed in treatment "BAG" at 11 h 30 min. The surface temperatures of deep beddings showed no significant differences between the sampling points. The temperature inside the deep litter at the front of the stall treatment was higher (M + B) when compared to treatment (ABG) and (MAR). The concentration of CO, CO 2 and NH 3, measured, gases not reached levels that could cause harm to the health of animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{resistance}} of composites board on termite attack {{is one of}} the important parameters on its quality. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the resistance to the subterranean termite attack of composite board made from Indonesian community forest tree species which was combined with cement sack waste paper as face and back layers. The samples of composite board fabricated from <b>shaving</b> particles <b>of</b> gmelina <b>wood</b> (Gmelina arborea), candlenut wood (Aleurites mollucana), and sengon wood (Paraserianthes falcataria) bonded by melamine formaldehyde resin at 10 % based on oven dry weight of particles and face/back layers. The treatment of this study consists of three factors namely: wood species (3 levels), part of tree (2 levels: steam and branch), and layers (2 levels: no layers and using 4 layers each side). Each board type was tested in three replications, totally 36 boards were produced. The results obtained are as follows: 1) the higher of composite board subterranean termite resistant were composite board made of gmelina, sengon, and candlenut, respectively. 2) the {{resistance of}} composite board made of steam part were not significantly different with those of branch part, 3) composite board made <b>of</b> gmelina <b>wood</b> without face and back layers were more resistance compared to those with cement sack face/back layers. However, composite board made of candlenut and sengon wood with cement sack face/back layers were more resistance compared to those of without face/back layers...|$|R
40|$|In my {{left hand}} I hold a thin piece of scrap wood {{about the length of}} my forearm. In my right hand, a chisel-ground knife called a kiridashi. I push the knife into the wood, and I observe the shaving extend out and curl outward. This thesis is {{simultaneously}} a search of the meaning in that inflection initiated in wood, and an exploration of a way to continue that inflection. As I continue working the inflection of curling wood, I begin a process of making. First whittling pieces of wood, then making spoons and bowls, then making carving tools, then making copper-working tools, then making copper bowls and dishes, and finally renovating a tea pavilion which I built several years before. However, I am interested not so much in the process of making as I am in the process of remaking. As I carve the recess of a bowl, or hammer a curve into the cutting edge of an adze iron, I am not investigating the making of that object in isolation, but instead interpret the act of making that particular thing as an act of remaking the original inflection I first observed in a curling <b>shaving</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> I owe the conviction and patience needed for this thesis greatly to my studies in music. It prepared me for the slow and intuitive process of remaking...|$|E
