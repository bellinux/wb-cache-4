40|$|In this paper, we analyze a large {{published}} {{data set}} 1 of cross sections of frontal sinuses of 3 to 11 -year-olds (105 males and 87 females) from Central Europe to investigate several {{issues relating to}} frontal sinus ontogeny. Despite a large variation in every one year age cohort, we detect no asymmetry of the left average versus the right average frontal <b>sinus</b> <b>lobe</b> cross-sectional areas in the population, neither for males nor for females. The growth rate is shown to be nonuniform and differs between males and females. We demonstrate {{the use of a}} sigmoid function interpolation to characterize one aspect of ontogeny, namely, the functional relation between the cross-sectional area of the frontal sinus and the age of the individual. Ontogenetic trajectories of these crosssectional areas are remarkably well modeled by a sigmoid function (logistic curve) with suitably estimated parameters for development up to an age of 11 years (females) and 9 years (males). However, these developmental curves also reliably predict the average adult cross-sectional area at age 19 (99 % for females, 95 % for males). Apart from possible inadequacies of the data set, we also discuss the possibility of heterochrony in the ontogenetic trajectory before versus after puberty...|$|E

40|$|Leaf characters, such as angles between major veins, {{ratios of}} the length of leaf lobes, of leaf <b>lobes</b> and <b>sinuses,</b> and of {{petioles}} and leaf lobes, were measured on leaves of different sizes and compared against leaf blade length (an indirect measure of developmental time) to see if there were differences between them at different developmental stages, and between the 3 taxa studied. Two trends were observed. Characters dealing with angles between major leaf veins, and those dealing with the ratio of the distance to the first point of branching of the major leaf vein of a lobe and the length of that leaf lobe, showed relatively little change over leaf blade length compared with more variable characters such as those involving the leaf petiole, leaf <b>sinuses</b> or leaf <b>lobes.</b> If it is assumed that leaves of different lengths represent leaves at different stages of development, it appears that the characters dealing with angles or venation do not change extensively over time.

All spines are triangular and dissimilar in length; the outer and inner spines are longer than the middle one. The outer spine has a sigmoid outer margin. The anterior ventral margin of the lorica with two pairs of rounded lobules was located at {{both sides of the}} slender <b>sinus.</b> Inner <b>lobes</b> show a narrower base than the outer one. The lateral antennae are pointing medially. The foot opening is located subterminally on the ventral plate. The trophi are symmetrical and lobular.

40|$|Abstract. Primary {{carcinoma}} of the frontal sinus is quite rare, with an incidence of 0. 3 - 1. 0 % of all paranasal sinus carcinomas. The early diagnosis is often difficult and the condition is often mistakenly considered to involve muco-celes, pyoceles or osteomyelitis. The present study reports {{the case of a}} 66 -year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma originating in the frontal sinus. The presenting symptoms were a cutaneous nodule {{on the left side of}} the forehead and a gradually progressive headache. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated erosion of the ethmoid <b>sinus,</b> frontal <b>lobe</b> and orbit. The radical resection under frontal craniotomy was performed followed by post-operative radiotherapy. Six months after the surgery, the MRI examinations did not find any recurrence, and the patient currently lives symptom-free. The present study illustrates that frontal sinus cancer should be diagnosed early with caution. Total surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, used singly or in combination, may result in favorable outcomes. The current study discusses the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of the present case and reviews the associated literature to emphasize the importance of an early identification of this rare disease...|$|R

40|$|Aerial {{architecture}} of seed plants {{is determined by}} the development of repeating modules named phytomers. An important factor therein is the formation and fate of axillary meristems (AMs), influencing agronomically important traits, like inflorescence architecture and shoot branching. The present study in tomato represents a reverse genetics approach unveiling the function of genes homologous to the MYB and bHLH proteins, Blind and LAX, two key regulators of axillary meristem initiation. Public databases and PCR technology enabled the identification of three closely related paralogs of Blind, Blind-like 1 (Bli 1), Bli 2 and Bli 3. TILLING of Bli 2 led to the identification of the classical tomato mutant potato leaf (c), a mutant described already {{more than a hundred years}} ago. potato leaf mutants display leaves with reduced leaflet formation and lack leaf lobing and serration. Nine potato leaf alleles were identified, all carrying a mutation in the Bli 2 gene. RNA in-situ hybridisation revealed a distinct expression pattern in leaf primordia prior to leaflet formation, at positions axillary of outgrowing leaflets and marking the <b>sinuses</b> of leaf <b>lobes.</b> Ectopic expression of Blind (Bl) partially complemented the defects of c, indicating a conserved function of the two proteins. Silencing of Bli 3 revealed that this gene probably acts in the same process as C, because RNAi plants displayed reduced leaf complexity. The protein similarity of Bl and C, the partial complementation of c by Bl and the phenotype of Bli 3 RNAi plants represent further elements in the rising evidence that leaf dissection and AM initiation employ homologous mechanisms. Furthermore, silencing of Bli 1 and Bli 3 unveiled that these genes redundantly regulate AM initiation in vegetative and reproductive development. The defect in AM initiation along the shoot axis was complementary to the defect of blind mutants. RNA in-situ hybridisation showed major expression domains of Blind in the shoot apical meristem, at positions of presumptive leaf primordium formation and adaxially of leaf primordia. Additionally, Blind mRNA accumulated adaxially of new reproductive and vegetative meristems. Besides AM initiation, Bl, Bli 1 and Bli 3 act in the prevention of concaulescent fusions of vegetative and reproductive side-shoots. Moreover, a series of observations disclosed that Bl, Bli 1 and Bli 3 control the maintenance and reproductive identity of apical and axillary meristems. In a second project, silencing of the bHLH transcription factor SlLax in tomato, led to the identification of the classical mutant, uniflora. SlLax/Uniflora encodes an ortholog of the AM initiation regulators, LAX (rice), ba 1 (maize) and ROB (Arabidopsis). Uniflora (Uf) was known to control inflorescence architecture and flowering time in a condition dependent manner. Detailed analysis of organogenesis in different uniflora mutant lines, unveiled that Uf controls the initiation of reproductive axillary meristems and regulates reproductive meristem identity. RNA in-situ hybridisation indicated that Uf mRNA accumulates adaxially of newly initiated reproductive AMs, similar to the expression pattern of Blind in inflorescences. Heterodimers of bHLH and MYB proteins regulate several developmental processes. Previous studies showed that the Uf and Blind orthologous proteins ROB and RAX of Arabidopsis interact physically. The phenotypic similarities of Uf and Bl, Bli 1 and Bli 3 loss of function plants, and the overlapping expression patterns of Uf and Bl strongly suggest that also in tomato these MYB and bHLH proteins may act as heterodimers controlling AM initiation and meristem identity in reproductive development. Together, the observations in tomato, rice, maize and Arabidopsis propose that heterodimers of Blind and LAX orthologous MYB and bHLH proteins constitute a fundamental mechanism, controlling axillary meristem formation in flowering plants. In summary, the present study unveiled the identity of two classical mutants and demonstrated that genes of the Blind family and Uniflora regulate four important features of aerial plant architecture in tomato: leaf compoundness, organ separation, axillary meristem initiation and the development of apical meristems...|$|R
