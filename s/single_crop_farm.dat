40|$|Despite {{the efforts}} made to develop Ethiopian {{agriculture}} over the years, {{the problems of}} hunger, famine, and malnutrition and land degradation still linger and present {{the greatest threat to}} the survival of the nation. With the new thrust to produce more food using high input and <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> <b>farming,</b> today’s farmers grow only one or two crops in monoculture systems. The traditional diversification of farmlands, which arguably has been the source of sustenance in rural Ethiopia since time immemorial, has largely been abandoned. Furthermore, deforestation, accelerated soil erosion, and land degradation are now serious problems in Ethiopia. As a result crop and livestock yields are generally very low and the recent drought has aggravated the situation. The land use system is associated with the decrease in the size of holdings both for arable and grazing lands. Thus there is a continued trend toward the conversion of forested and marginal lands to agricultural lands, resulting in massive environmental degradation and a serious threat to sustainable agriculture and forestry. While agroforestry should not be taken as a panacea for land-use problems in Ethiopia, it may be considered as a potential alternative to some of the wasteful land-use practices in the country. Agroforestry is a dynamic, ecologically based, natural resources management system that, through integration of trees on farms and agricultural landscapes, diversifies and sustains production for increased social, economic, and environmental benefits for land users at all level...|$|R
40|$|The {{fear for}} serious {{shortage}} {{of food to}} be able to feed the exponentially growing world population in the relatively near future is widespread. As available arable land is limited, the discussions generally focus on either further expansion of intensive farming or on the need for eating less protein from meat. However, these arguments are mostly used by rich countries with very high animal protein intakes and not enough arable land. They would rather buy or lease land in developing countries to satisfy their consumption needs. In addressing food security in poor countries and emerging economies, the focus should not be so much on food in general but rather on the adequate availability of essential nutrients. In Africa, micronutrient malnutrition is a much bigger problem than undernourishment (under-nutrition). The lecture will address food security from a practical angle applicable to both rich and developing societies and focusing on essential dietary nutrients, agricultural efficiency (e. g. stay away from growing crops for fuel, avoid <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> <b>farming),</b> and food fortification. Other factors which strongly affect food security are food safety and quality. Food safety can be compromised by chemical and microbiological contamination, the latter of which poses a considerably higher risk than the former. The safety of food can also be challenged by food adulteration which, unfortunately, is and not restricted to the rich countries in Europe, the US and China, but happens also in developing countries where generally regulatory compliance monitoring and control systems are limited. The lecture will address several aspects of the food production and food processing chain, the pivotal role of small producers and consumers, responsibilities and tasks of governmental policy and monitoring authorities, and, last but not least, the need for broad education and training at higher (academic) as well as lower levels. The future of any country is defined by the level of education of its people...|$|R
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that growing coffee {{in tandem with}} trees improves the quality of coffee. Worldwide, coffee producers are suffering from low prices, with overproduction partly to blame. Countries such as Kenya and Brazil produce coffee in the full sun, a practice which produces higher yields, but poorer quality beans. One answer, according to researcher Ciro Righi, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, is to use agroforestry systems to grow coffee. Trees create a favourable climate for coffee growth and production. Shade coffee, grown under trees, results in better quality coffee that can be sold at a higher price, he says. Righi made the claim at a recent seminar on coffee and rubber agroforestry systems, held at the Nairobi headquarters of the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF). He cited research in his native Brazil which shows that shade reduces temperature variations and keeps coffee plants and upper soil layers from overheating, making them less vulnerable during the dry season. The cover provided by plant canopy reduces water loss through evapotranspiration. Fodder legume trees trimmed {{several times a year}} can improve coffee plant nutrition by fixing nitrogen and recycling nutrients. The Brazilian studies show that rubber production in agroforestry systems is 50 % higher than in <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> <b>farms.</b> The shade provided by trees also increases the formation of fruit buds on the coffee plants. Farmers benefit twice over they get better quality coffee and can sell products from the trees to earn extra income. In Brazil, rubber and coffee have proved to be a winning combination. But experts caution that care should be taken to avoid trees which do not lose leaves, as coffee still needs some sunlight. ICRAF s Dr Chin Ong says that in East Africa, Melia volkensi is the best tree species to use with coffee, since it has the same qualities as rubber.

40|$|The {{concept of}} water {{productivity}} (WP) or ‘more crop per drop’ has been revived recently in international water debates. Its application has notably been extended from <b>single</b> <b>crops</b> to mixed <b>farming</b> systems, integrating both crops and livestock, with the wider objective of reducing poverty. Using {{evidence from the}} Ganga Basin, India, we discuss the relevance of this concept {{as a tool to}} guide interventions for livelihood improvement and poverty alleviation. We argue that WP studies would benefit from greater attention to the role of capitals, inequities and institutions. Firstly, it is crucial to acknowledge the heterogeneity of capitals and capabilities of farmers to make changes in their farming systems and practices and avoid one-fix-all interventions. Identifying pre-existing inequities in water access within and among communities will support better targeting of poor communities. WP interventions can either reinforce or reduce interhousehold inequities within communities. We stress the need for assessment of institutional impacts of WP interventions on water access and development. ...|$|R
30|$|Hazell et al. (1986) {{are among}} the few who compare the costs of {{diversification}} with the benefits of crop insurance for managing the effects of drought risks. The more an area is suitable for a <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> (less diversified <b>farming</b> system), the higher its vulnerability to yield and price risk caused by drought. Smallholders being price takers and lacking basic market information implies that they should rely on diversification for adapting the effects of drought in the foreseeable future. This reinforces the need for improved varieties that are drought tolerant. Hence, the key challenge for crop/livestock breeders is to develop varieties capable of adapting to drought risk, while maintaining better yield and other desirable characteristics perceived by farmers. For instance, crop varieties with abiotic stress tolerance saved more than 50  % of the current yield loss in drought-prone areas (Wang et al. 2003). Hence, developing drought-tolerant varieties and investing in small-scale irrigation should also be key risk management strategies for low income countries in their medium- and long-term plans.|$|R

40|$|About {{three out}} of every four income-earners in Tanzania are {{small-scale}} farmers and food insecurity remains a chronic problem for many of them. Around 48 % of households in rural areas were either moderately or severely food energy deficient in 2011 and 39 % of rural children under 5 years were stunted in 2013. To improve food security in Tanzania, {{it is important to understand}} the existing farming systems and their relationship with household food security. This study was conducted in two distinctly different agro-ecological zones of Tanzania, namely Kishapu and Mvomero Districts, to determine the main factors which influence farm households’ choice of farming systems and how these associate with food security. Data were collected during both pre- and post-harvest seasons in 2014 from 506 farm households, and augmented with market surveys, key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Four main farming systems were identified based on: crops cultivated; degree of market orientation for particular crops; and the number of livestock units owned. Household food security status was measured and a combination of Expected Utility Theory and Theory of Planned Behaviour used to analyse the factors associated with household choice of farming system. The study found that households which diversified their income sources through off-farm activities were more likely to have better food access in the lean (pre-harvest) periods. The factors influencing decisions on farming systems were related to the household size, farming context and farm characteristics. In the semi-arid and remote areas of Kishapu, larger households were more likely to choose a Mixed <b>Crop</b> and Livestock <b>farming</b> system, indicating that larger family size ensured the supply of needed labour for both livestock keeping and cropping activities. In the higher rainfall and more accessible district of Mvomero, households were more likely to practice a <b>Single</b> Food <b>Crop</b> <b>farming</b> system and were compelled to seek out off-farm work. The study recommends that strategies to improve food security in rural areas should attempt to: enhance income from farming, promote off-farm income generating activities, and promote behavioural change communication on what is culturally regarded as food in the study area...|$|R
