5|$|Serbian–American {{relations}} are bilateral {{relations between the}} governments of <b>Serbia</b> and the United States. They were first established in 1882. From 1918 to 2006, the United States maintained relations with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later <b>Serbia</b> and Montenegro), of which <b>Serbia</b> is considered the legal successor.|$|E
5|$|While <b>Serbia</b> and Croatia never {{declared}} war on each other, <b>Serbia</b> was directly and indirectly involved in the war {{through a number of}} activities. Its foremost involvement entailed material support of the JNA. Following the independence of various republics from SFR Yugoslavia, <b>Serbia</b> provided the bulk of manpower and funding that was channeled to the war effort through Serbian control of the Yugoslav presidency and the federal defense ministry. <b>Serbia</b> actively supported various paramilitary volunteer units from <b>Serbia</b> that were fighting in Croatia. Even though no actual fighting occurred on Serbian or Montenegrin soil, involvement of the two was evident through the maintenance of prison camps in <b>Serbia</b> and Montenegro, which became places where a number of war crimes were committed.|$|E

5|$|Yugoslavia and <b>Serbia</b> and Montenegro {{were both}} dissolved, in 1991 and 2006 respectively. <b>Serbia</b> and Montenegro {{in the attempt}} to mask as Yugoslavia, participated in the 1992 Contest under its name but {{representing}} the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which consisted of only the two republics. Both Montenegro and <b>Serbia</b> have competed as separate countries since 2007.|$|E

5|$|After {{conducting}} a criminal investigation, verifying that Germany would honor its military alliance, and persuading the skeptical Hungarian Count Tisza, Austria-Hungary issued a formal {{letter to the}} government of <b>Serbia.</b> The letter reminded <b>Serbia</b> of its commitment to respect the Great Powers' decision regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to maintain good neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary. The letter contained specific demands aimed at preventing the publication of propaganda advocating the violent destruction of Austria-Hungary, removing the people behind this propaganda from the Serbian Military, arresting the people on Serbian soil {{who were involved in the}} assassination plot and preventing the clandestine shipment of arms and explosives from <b>Serbia</b> to Austria-Hungary.|$|E
5000|$|After it was {{determined}} that the two-candidate runoff would consist of Tadić and Nikolić, the period after the first round voting converged on <b>Serbia's</b> accession to the European Union, the status of Kosovo in <b>Serbia's</b> constitution, and various social issues.|$|R

40|$|The {{issues of}} Kosovo intependence and European Union {{membership}} have dominated Serbian domestic politics {{and foreign policy}} {{since the fall of}} Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. Despite the lack of formal conditionality on the Kosovo issue, <b>Serbia's</b> isnsitence on its uncompromising 'no recognition' Kosovo policy has been detrimental to its EU candidacy aspirations. This article examines <b>Serbia's</b> Kosovo policies in the context of EU integration, examining in particular the divergence between <b>SErbia's</b> stance towards Kosovo and its aspirations towards EU candidacy...|$|R
5|$|After two {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts by}} <b>Serbia,</b> supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, {{to obtain the}} Yugoslav Presidency's approval of a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991, and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March, the JNA itself, supported by <b>Serbia</b> and its allies, asked the federal Presidency to give it wartime authorities and declare a state of emergency. The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA came under control of Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. Milošević, preferring a campaign to expand <b>Serbia</b> rather than preservation of Yugoslavia, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared {{that he no longer}} recognized the authority of the federal Presidency. The threat caused the JNA to gradually abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of <b>Serbia.</b> By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated to the first fatalities. The JNA stepped in, supporting the insurgents, and preventing Croatian police from intervening. In early April, leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention of integration of the area under their control, viewed by the Government of Croatia as a breakaway region with <b>Serbia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{signed a}} new treaty of {{alliance}} with Leszek of Poland {{in the summer of}} 1216. Leszek and Andrew's son, Coloman, invaded Halych and expelled Mstislav Mstislavich and Daniel Romanovich, after which Coloman was restored. That same year, Andrew met Stephen Nemanjić, Grand Prince of <b>Serbia,</b> in Ravno (now Ćuprija, <b>Serbia).</b> He persuaded Stephen Nemanjić to negotiate with Henry, Latin Emperor of Constantinople, who was the uncle of Andrew's second wife, Yolanda de Courtenay. Stephen Nemanjić was crowned king of <b>Serbia</b> in 1217. Andrew planned to invade <b>Serbia,</b> but Stephen Nemanjić's brother, Sava, dissuaded him, according to both versions of the Life of Sava.|$|E

5|$|Diplomatic {{relations}} between the then-Kingdom of <b>Serbia</b> and the United States were established in the 19th century. In 1879, the Serbian Consulate-General in New York was opened. On February 3, 1882, the Serbian Parliament adopted a contract and Convention of diplomatic {{relations between}} the Kingdom of <b>Serbia</b> and the United States, given by King Milan Obrenović. The United States Senate adopted both documents on July 5, 1882 without debate or amendments. On November 10, 1882, Eugene Schuyler became the first United States ambassador in <b>Serbia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Duklja was {{an early}} medieval Serbian principality whose borders coincided {{for the most part}} with those of present-day Montenegro. The state rose greatly in power after the {{disintegration}} of <b>Serbia</b> that followed the death of its ruler, Prince Časlav, around 943. Though the extent of Časlav's <b>Serbia</b> is uncertain, it is known that it included at least Raška (now part of Central <b>Serbia)</b> and Bosnia. Raška had subsequently come under Duklja's political dominance, along with the neighboring Serbian principalities of Travunia and Zachlumia (in present-day Herzegovina and south Dalmatia). The Byzantines often referred to Duklja as <b>Serbia.</b>|$|E

5|$|From 1945, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was governed as {{a federal}} socialist state {{comprising}} six newly created republics– Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, <b>Serbia,</b> Montenegro and Macedonia. The current border between <b>Serbia</b> and Croatia was defined in 1945 by a Yugoslav federal government commission which assigned areas with a majority Serb population to the Socialist Republic of <b>Serbia</b> and those with a Croatian majority to the Socialist Republic of Croatia. This left a large Serb minority in Croatian territory.|$|E
5|$|Golubac {{was held}} by the Habsburg Monarchy between 1688 and 1690 and 1718 and 1739. Serb rebels {{controlled}} it during Kočina Krajina in 1788–91, and again from 1804–13, during the First Serbian Uprising. Afterwards, it fell back under Ottoman control until 1867 when it, along with Kalemegdan and other towns in <b>Serbia,</b> was given to Knez Mihailo of <b>Serbia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Greece emerged victorious {{after the}} 1912-1913 Balkan Wars, with her {{territory}} almost doubled. The unstable international political {{climate of the}} early 20th century placed Greece in a difficult position. The ownership of the Greek occupied eastern Aegean islands was contested by the Ottoman Empire which claimed them as their own. In the north, Bulgaria, defeated in the Second Balkan War, was engineering revanchist strategies against Greece and <b>Serbia.</b> The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against <b>Serbia.</b> This caused Germany and Austria-Hungary, and countries allied with <b>Serbia</b> (the Triple Entente) to declare war on each other, starting World War I.|$|E
