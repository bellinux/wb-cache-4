50|$|Interferometry {{has been}} used for various {{quantitative}} characterisation of optical systems indicating their overall performance. Traditionally, Fizeau interferometers have been used to detect optical or polished surface forms but new advances in precision manufacturing has allowed industrial point diffraction interferometry possible. PDI is especially suited for high resolution, high accuracy measurements in laboratory conditions to noisy factory floors. Lack of reference optics makes the method suitable to visualise absolute surface form of optical systems. Therefore, a PDI is uniquely suitable to verify the reference optics of other interferometers. It is also immensely useful in analysing <b>optical</b> <b>assemblies</b> used in Laser based systems. Characterising optics for UV lithography. Quality control of precision optics. Verifying the actual resolution of an <b>optical</b> <b>assembly.</b> Measuring the wavefront map produced by X-ray optics.

Alternately, the gratings may be electrically connected to the energy supply and energized, e. g., with alternating voltages, to change the refractive index. A data recorder may record the predetermined spectral characteristic. A method of detecting a spectral characteristic of a predetermined wavelength of source light includes generating collimated light using an <b>optical</b> <b>assembly,</b> directing the collimated light onto the micro-ring grating assembly, and selectively energizing the micro-ring grating assembly to diffract the predetermined wavelength onto the target focal point, and detecting the spectral characteristic using a photon detector...|$|R

5000|$|Reflector sights have {{unlimited}} eye relief, {{meaning that}} the user may place his eye at any distance from the sight and the reticle will remain visible. This allows flexibility in mounting and shooting position. The CompM4 uses Aimpoint's [...] "parallax-free" [...] optical correction system, meaning there is minimal induced optical error that would shift the point of aim relative to the <b>sight's</b> <b>optical</b> axis as the user's eye moves off-center {{in relation to the}} sight. The sight itself is parallax-free at around 50 yards, {{meaning that the}} red dot will not change position relative to the target based on eye position at that range. As in other reflex sights, the point of aim will change position based on eye position at other ranges with the maximum error being equal to the diameter of the <b>sight's</b> <b>optical</b> window at short range. There are currently two variants available; the standard CompM4 and the CompM4S, the latter being the same in terms of features and functionality, but having the battery compartment & power control knob mounted {{near the bottom of the}} sight instead of near the top.|$|R

Thermal responses of the TMT telescope structure were predicted and the temperature distributions of the <b>optical</b> <b>assembly</b> systems were calculated under sample thermal loading conditions. The thermo-elastic analysis was made to obtain the thermal deformation based on the resulting temperature distributions. The line of sight calculation was made using the thermally induced structural deformations. The goal of this thermal analysis is to establish thermal models by the FEA programs to simulate for an adequate thermal environment.
