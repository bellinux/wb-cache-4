50|$|Of {{the various}} thermal spray methods, {{one of the}} more ideal and {{commonly}} used techniques for coating superalloys is plasma spraying. This is due to the versatility of usable coatings, and the high-temperature performance of plasma-sprayed coatings. Plasma <b>spraying</b> <b>can</b> accommodate a very wide range of materials, much more so than other techniques. As long as the difference between melting and decomposition temperatures is greater than 300 Kelvin, a material can be melted and applied as a coating via plasma spraying.|$|E
50|$|One {{of the key}} {{attributes}} of atomised spraying is giving excellent tip coverage to components. When conformal coatings are applied to a PCB they {{have a tendency to}} slump. The first layer of a coating can give a thin edge on the corner of components. This can be countered with a second coat through double dipping or over brushing but this is a repeat process and may not be acceptable. To counter this problem the technique of atomised <b>spraying</b> <b>can</b> be used.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, artist Ricardo Carvalho and {{programmer}} Alias Cummings {{created an}} interactive urinal entitled Global Warming {{in which the}} trail of urine hits on a grid of ultra sensitive piezos housed within the urinal. The strength {{and direction of the}} urine is calculated and used to control the navigation of a 3D Earth globe, leaving a trail of thousands of Google Earth place markers on its surface. The spectator's action is reminiscent of spraying, the animal behaviour of identifying and marking territory. Global Warming, besides its obvious environmental connotation, is an ironic take on how primitive territorial instincts, such as the visceral act of <b>spraying,</b> <b>can</b> be exercised through supposedly intelligent and networked devices {{and at the same time}} disguised by them.|$|E
50|$|Thermal <b>spraying</b> <b>can</b> provide thick {{coatings}} (approx. {{thickness range}} is 20 micrometers to several mm, {{depending on the}} process and feedstock), over a large area at high deposition rate as compared to other coating processes such as electroplating, physical and chemical vapor deposition. Coating materials available for thermal spraying include metals, alloys, ceramics, plastics and composites. They are fed in powder or wire form, heated to a molten or semimolten state and accelerated towards substrates {{in the form of}} micrometer-size particles. Combustion or electrical arc discharge is usually used as the source of energy for thermal spraying. Resulting coatings are made by the accumulation of numerous sprayed particles. The surface may not heat up significantly, allowing the coating of flammable substances.|$|E
50|$|Black sigatoka is a fungal {{leaf spot}} disease first {{observed}} in Fiji in 1963 or 1964. Black Sigatoka (also known as black leaf streak) {{has spread to}} banana plantations throughout the tropics from infected banana leaves that were used as packing material. It affects all main cultivars of bananas and plantains (including the Cavendish cultivars), impeding photosynthesis by blackening parts of the leaves, eventually killing the entire leaf. Starved for energy, fruit production falls by 50% or more, and the bananas that do grow ripen prematurely, making them unsuitable for export. The fungus has shown ever-increasing resistance to treatment, with the current expense for treating 1 ha exceeding $1,000 per year. In addition to the expense, {{there is the question}} of how long intensive <b>spraying</b> <b>can</b> be environmentally justified. Several resistant cultivars of banana have been developed, but none has yet received commercial acceptance due to taste and texture issues.|$|E

Power plants 7 and 8 had PM 2.5 elimination efficiencies of 83.11  % and 42.85  %, respectively. The WFGD of plant 9 had an efficiency of − 228.15  % for PM 2.5. In WFGD equipment, <b>spraying</b> <b>can</b> eliminate certain particles. However, gypsum and limestone particles can be further transformed into fine particles through entrainment and drying, thereby increasing PM 2.5 concentration. Rationally designing the parameters of desulfurization towers can help further eliminate PM 2.5 after the use of precipitators.|$|E

40|$|In Bangladesh most of {{the farmer}} use manual weed control {{practices}} like hand hoe. However, virtually weed-free conditions are now possible using the range of herbicides available. Herbicides are particularly useful for inter-row weeding especially when {{it is difficult to}} hoe in the planted row without damaging the crop. So herbicides <b>spraying</b> <b>can</b> be the most suitable approach for farmers because it is less time consuming and less laborious way for weed control. It is the most effective way also because it destroys not only weed foliage but also roots, rhizomes, stems and the apical shoots. Even in conservation agriculture (CA) system weed control is the main factor which can be effectively controlled by spraying herbicide with sprayer before planting. This is why performance evaluation of sprayers is now important to control weeds...|$|E
40|$|The tensile {{adhesion}} strength of thermally sprayed coating is conventionally evaluated via the ASTM C 633 - 69 standard.

40|$|The {{movement}} of a pesticide or herbicide to an off-target site during agricultural <b>spraying</b> <b>can</b> cause injury to wildlife, plants and contamination of surface water. This phenomenon {{is known as}} spray drift and can be controlled by spraying during favorable environmental conditions, and by using low drift nozzles and drift control adjuvants (DCAs). Polymeric DCAs {{are the most common}} type of DCA and function by increasing the droplet size produced during spraying. There are, however, two main drawbacks of polymeric DCAs; they are prone to mechanical degradation during spraying which reduces their performance and they can produce oversized drops which reduces the efficacy of the spray. In this trend article, existing DCA technology is reviewed including the mechanism through which they function. This then provides a platform for the discussion of novel polymeric architectures which have currently not been applied in DCA formulations...|$|E

An image is subdivided into blocks and each block is modelled as a single texture. The number of different textures in the image is assumed unknown. A hierarchical Bayesian procedure is used where the texture labels have a Potts model (colour Ising Markov random field) prior and the pixels within a block are distributed according to a Gaussian Markov random field, with the parameters dependent {{on the type of}} texture. We simulate from the posterior distribution by using a reversible jump Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, where the number of different texture components is allowed to vary. The methodology is applied to a simulated image and then we carry out texture segmentation on the weed and crop images that motivated the work. Copyright 2003 Royal Statistical Society. ...|$|E
