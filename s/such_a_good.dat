5|$|As a child, Sörenstam was {{a talented}} all-round sportsgirl. She was a nationally ranked junior tennis player, played {{football}} (soccer) {{in her hometown}} team Bro IK, and was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> skier that {{the coach of the}} Swedish national ski team suggested the family move to northern Sweden to improve her skiing year round.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson played pubs with Shots on {{a regular}} basis to small audiences. One {{particular}} night, Dickinson suddenly stopped {{in the middle of a}} song and started interviewing a man in the audience, heckling for not paying enough attention. He got <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> response he started doing it every night until it became a regular routine used to catch the audience's attention. Dickinson states that this experience taught him how to be a frontman.|$|E
5|$|It all {{happened}} that night. She {{told us the}} title of the song, the concept and sang us the melody. We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there so I had to work on the chord myself. So I was playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> ear that she sang me the chord.|$|E

5|$|On April 1, 1944, del Valle, as Commanding General of the Third Corps Artillery, III Marine Amphibious Corps, {{took part}} in the Battle of Guam and was awarded a Gold Star in lieu of a second Legion of Merit. The men under his command did <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job with their heavy {{artillery}} that no one man could be singled out for commendation. Instead each man was given a letter of commendation by del Valle, which was carried in his record books.|$|E
5|$|The wreck timbers {{were found}} under a {{sediment}} that preserved {{the remains of}} the wooden vessel, without which the wreck would have been lost due to marine worms. Wrecks of this age are rare finds and this particular one was in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> condition that much of the hull was preserved. This has given us an insight into how ships of this period were constructed—something which has not been seen before as no Arabian ship of this type had previously been found, nor any with their cargo intact.|$|E
5|$|On 4 April 1940, Robertson {{joined the}} Second AIF himself, with {{the rank of}} brigadier, and was {{allocated}} the AIF service number VX20321. He was appointed to command the 19th Infantry Brigade, which was then being formed from units made surplus by {{the reduction of the}} 6th Division from 12 infantry battalions to nine. All three of its battalions, the 2/4th, 2/8th and 2/11th Infantry Battalions, were initially commanded by over-age officers, but the commander of the 2/4th was replaced by Ivan Dougherty in August. Initially, Dougherty received a cool reception from Robertson, who was disappointed at being unable to select his own battalion commanders, but Dougherty soon made <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> impression that when Robertson went on leave in October 1940 he recommended that Dougherty act as brigade commander, {{despite the fact that he}} was the youngest and most junior of Robertson's battalion chiefs.|$|E

5|$|On April 1, 1944, Brigadier General Pedro del Valle, as Commanding General of the Third Corps Artillery, III Marine Amphibious Corps, {{took part}} in the Battle of Guam and was awarded a Gold Star in lieu of a second Legion of Merit. The men under his command did <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job with their heavy {{artillery}} that no one man could be singled out for commendation. Instead each man was given a letter of commendation by del Valle, which was carried in his record books. Col. Jaime Sabater who had previously participated in the Bougainville campaign and who was now the executive officer of the 9th Marines in Guam was wounded in action on July 21, 1944, and awarded the Purple Heart.|$|E
5|$|On 29 July 1781 Sérurier {{was awarded}} the Order of Saint-Louis. On 10 May 1782 he assumed the rank of captain commandant and on 1 June 1783 he took command of the regiment's Chasseur company. Irked {{by the lack of}} promotion, he asked to retire on pension on 8 September 1788. His {{commanding}} officer argued to retain <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> officer and Sérurier transferred into the Médoc Regiment as a major on 17 May 1789. He became lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1791. Since the French Revolution the garrison at Perpignan became agitated so the regiment was sent there to calm down the other troops. Instead, the Médoc Regiment itself became affected by the troubles. On 23 July 1791, fearing that Sérurier was about to leave the country with the regiment's colors, a body of soldiers removed them from his quarters. In January 1792, 19 officers from the regiment emigrated to Spain. A story existed that Sérurier and a companion tried to flee to Spain but were nearly caught by a patrol and only his companion made it across the border. In June 1792 the Médoc, renamed the 70th Infantry Regiment, marched to the Camp of Tournoux in the Alps. Sérurier became the commanding officer of the 70th with the rank of colonel on 7 August 1792.|$|E
25|$|In 1833 Borg {{was awarded}} the Order of St. Michael and St. George by the British.

25|$|Davidson met {{the band}} and {{realized}} that they closely resembled the band {{as described in the}} script, right down to a Cape Verdean saxophone player, whom he cast in the film. Initially, Cafferty was only hired to write a few songs for the film, but he did <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job of capturing the feeling of the 1960s and 1980s that Davidson asked him to score the entire film.|$|E
25|$|As {{all three}} players were well {{regarded}} in Boston — Lewis {{had been a}} key player on the 1910s championship teams, Shore had famously relieved Babe Ruth and retired 27 straight, and Leonard had only four years before set a modern record for earned run average — this trade was regarded as not <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> one in Boston. Then, on July 13, 1919, submarine-style pitching star Carl Mays {{was traded to the}} Yankees for Bob McGraw, Allan Russell and $40,000.|$|E
25|$|The British and French {{would then}} argue that Egypt's control {{of such an}} {{important}} route was too tenuous, and that it needed be placed under Anglo-French management. David Ben-Gurion did not trust the British in view of their treaty with Jordan {{and he was not}} initially in favour of the plan, since it would make Israel alone look like the aggressor; however he soon agreed to it since <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> opportunity to strike back at Egypt might never again present itself.|$|E

25|$|In 2010 Wexford {{took part}} in Division 2 of the Allianz National Hurling League once again playing this time against Clare. The Model men were once again the favourites, having <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> league experience. Despite a disappointing {{performance}} Wexford still ran out winners at the end only to be promoted back to Division 1 of the Allianz National Hurling League after waiting three years. Wexford began the Leinster Championship 2010 with a defeat to Galway in Nowlan Park despite having a good second half.|$|E
25|$|A month later, 25 October, at Stuttgart, Richard Strauss {{conducted}} the première of his Ariadne auf Naxos. The {{first and third}} performances were with the élite soloists Maria Jeritza, Margarethe Siems, Herman Jadlowker: the second was the Stuttgart team, Erb as Bacchus. In May 1913 at the Imperial performance at Wiesbaden he sang Hüon in Oberon. The Kaiser said to him, 'You must be a good Lohengrin. Tell Baron von Putlitz I thank him for having sent <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> performer of Huon.' Erb's farewell to Stuttgart after his six years there was as Lohengrin.|$|E
25|$|At {{any time}} {{there must be}} a minimum of two wrestlers ranked as komusubi. If {{circumstances}} require this can rise to three or four, for example if both komusubi have winning records and an upper maegashira produces <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> score that he cannot reasonably be denied a promotion. However, this is relatively rare. The minimum of two requirement means that a certain amount of luck can lead to wrestlers achieving this rank on occasion, if the performance of other wrestlers leaves no obvious candidates to fill the rank.|$|E

25|$|His {{continued}} unpaid {{promotion of}} Eastern Air Lines {{earned him the}} undying gratitude of good friend Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace who {{was the president of}} the airline. He was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> friend of the airline that Rickenbacker took a retiring Douglas DC-3, fitted it out with an executive interior and DC-4 engines, and presented it to Godfrey, who then used it to commute to the studios in New York City from his huge Leesburg, Virginia, farm every Sunday night.|$|E
25|$|Lizzie Hexam also {{objects to}} her {{marriage}} to Eugene Wrayburn. She does not aspire to marrying Wrayburn even though she loves him and would be elevated in society simply by marrying him, which almost any woman would have done at the time. Lizzie feels that she is unworthy of him. Wrayburn, however, feels that he is unworthy of <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> woman. He also knows that his father would disapprove of her low social status. Therefore, both of them end up going against expectations by marrying each other.|$|E
25|$|A better {{solution}} came {{along in the}} form of the US's AGM-48 Skybolt missile. The US bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the British V bombers, and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion, with a long-range standoff missile. In this case, however, the missile in question had a truly long range of just under 2,000km. Considering the distance from London to Moscow is about 2,500km, Skybolt would allow the V-bomber force to attack Russia from sites not far off the British coast, with complete immunity. Skybolt seemed like <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> solution that work on both Blue Steel II and Blue Streak were cancelled.|$|E
