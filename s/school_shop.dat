25|$|School {{authorities}} in the Japanese city of Osaka are now chipping children's clothing, backpacks, and student IDs in a primary school. A school in Doncaster, England is piloting a monitoring system designed {{to keep tabs on}} pupils by tracking radio chips in their uniforms. St Charles Sixth Form College in west London, England, started September, 2008, is using an RFID card system to check {{in and out of the}} main gate, to both track attendance and prevent unauthorized entrance. Similarly, Whitcliffe Mount School in Cleckheaton, England uses RFID to track pupils and staff in and out of the building via a specially designed card. In the Philippines, some schools already use RFID in IDs for borrowing books and also gates in those particular schools have RFID ID scanners for buying items at a <b>school</b> <b>shop</b> and canteen, library and also to sign in and sign out for student and teacher's attendance.|$|E
25|$|Out of {{first-class}} cricket, Gimblett {{took a job}} as a cricket professional with Ebbw Vale Cricket Club in South Wales. He then {{applied for}} and got a job with his old Somerset captain, Jack Meyer, who was headmaster of Millfield School. The link with Meyer gave rise to continuing rumours of a possible comeback for Somerset across the 1950s, but it did not happen. In 1959, however, he appeared in a few Minor Counties matches for Dorset. At Millfield, Gimblett helped with the cricket coaching, ran the <b>school</b> <b>shop</b> and did other tasks around the school such as driving minibuses. In the end, his mental and physical health problems– he suffered from arthritis– meant he fell out with Millfield in the same way that he had with county cricket, and he retired to live at Minehead; he was involved in a minor way with coaching and fund-raising for Somerset, but his behaviour was sometimes unpredictable and he found it hard to reconcile his former fame with his reduced circumstances.|$|E

60|$|The meeting then adjourned to the <b>School</b> <b>shop,</b> Barrett {{enjoying his}} ice {{all the more}} for the thought that his secret still was a secret. A thing which it would in all {{probability}} have ceased to be, had he been rash enough to confide it to K. St H. Grey, who, whatever his other merits, was very far from being the safest sort of confidant. His usual practice was to speak first, and to think, if at all, afterwards.|$|E
60|$|It {{was during}} the {{interval}} that day that Stone and Robinson, discussing the subject of cricket over a bun and ginger beer at the <b>school</b> <b>shop,</b> came to a momentous decision, to wit, that they were {{fed up with the}} Adair administration and meant to strike. The immediate cause of revolt was early-morning fielding practice, that searching test of cricket keenness. Mike himself, to whom cricket was the great and serious interest in life, had shirked early-morning fielding practice in his first term at Wrykyn. And Stone and Robinson had but a lukewarm attachment to the game, compared with Mike's.|$|E
60|$|At {{about the}} time when this {{conversation}} was in progress, Wyatt, crossing the cricket-field towards the <b>school</b> <b>shop</b> in search of something fizzy that might correct a burning thirst acquired at the nets, espied on the horizon a suit of cricket flannels surmounted by a huge, expansive grin. As {{the distance between them}} lessened, he discovered that inside the flannels was Neville-Smith's body and behind the grin the rest of Neville-Smith's face. Their visit to the nets not having coincided in point of time, as the Greek exercise books say, Wyatt had not seen his friend since the list of the team had been posted on the board, so he proceeded to congratulate him on his colours.|$|E
