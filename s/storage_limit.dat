25|$|Counterfeit USB flash drives are {{sometimes}} sold with claims of having higher capacities {{than they actually}} have. These are typically low capacity USB drives which are modified so that they emulate larger capacity drives (for example, a 2GB drive being marketed as a 64GB drive). When plugged into a computer, they report themselves as being the larger capacity they were sold as, but when data is written to them, either the write fails, the drive freezes up, or it overwrites existing data. Software tools exist to check and detect fake USB drives, {{and in some cases}} it is possible to repair these devices to remove the false capacity information and use its real <b>storage</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|E

40|$|Cowan's review {{shows that}} a {{short-term}} memory limit of four items {{is consistent with a}} wide range of phenomena in the field. However he does not explain that limit, whereas an existing theory does offer an explanation for capacity limitations. Furthermore processing capacity limits cannot be reduced to <b>storage</b> <b>limits</b> as Cowan claims. In his excellent review, Cowan concludes that short term memory <b>storage</b> is <b>limited</b> to four items, and he notes this corresponds to the limit in processing capacity defined by Halford, Wilson & Phillips (BBS, 1998). Furthermore his conclusion that the limit is in the number of integrated objects, independent of the complexity of each, agrees well with the observation of HW&P (1998) that humans are limited to relating four entities, irrespective of their complexity. However these correspondences do not imply that processing limits can be subsumed under <b>storage</b> <b>limits,</b> as Cowan claims.
