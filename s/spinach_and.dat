5|$|Many {{vegetarian}} {{restaurants and}} producers of vegetarian foods acquire a hechsher, certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher. The hechsher usually certifies that certain vegetables have been checked for insect infestation and steps {{have been taken}} to ensure that cooked food meets the requirements of bishul Yisrael. Vegetables such as <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> cauliflower must be checked for insect infestation. The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, growing conditions, and views of individual rabbis.|$|E
5|$|Shakshouka, {{originally}} a workman’s breakfast popularized by North African Jews in Israel, is made simply of fried eggs in spicy tomato sauce, with other vegetable ingredients or sausage optional. Shakshouka is typically {{served in the}} same frying pan {{in which it is}} cooked, with thick slices of white bread to mop up the sauce, and a side of salad. Modern variations include a milder version made with <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> feta without tomato sauce, and hot chili shakshouka, a version that includes both sweet and hot peppers and coriander.|$|E

5|$|Visual display was prized. Brilliant {{colors were}} {{obtained}} by the addition of, for example, juices from <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> the green part of leeks. Yellow came from saffron or egg yolk, while red came from sunflower, and purple came from Crozophora tinctoria or Heliotropium europaeum. Gold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish {{made to look like}} a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.|$|E

25|$|A {{distinction}} can be {{made between}} older varieties of <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> more modern ones. Older varieties tend to bolt too early in warm conditions. Newer varieties tend to grow more rapidly, but have less of an inclination to run up to seed. The older varieties have narrower leaves and {{tend to have a}} stronger and more bitter taste. Most newer varieties have broader leaves and round seeds.|$|E
25|$|The Baudelaires {{go see the}} Quagmires {{and tell}} them what happened. Then the Quagmires plot a plan.

The Quagmires leave their notebooks with Violet and Klaus so that they can study. Violet invents a staple-making device (using a small crab, a potato, metal rods, creamed <b>spinach,</b> <b>and</b> a fork) and makes staples while Klaus reads the notebooks out loud.|$|E
25|$|In Northern Iran, Mâst Chekide is {{a variety}} of kefir yogurt with a {{distinct}} sour taste. It is usually mixed with a pesto-like water and fresh herb purée called delal. Yogurt is a side dish to all Iranian meals. The most popular appetizers are spinach or eggplant borani, Mâst-o-Khiâr with cucumber, spring onions and herbs, and Mâst-Musir with wild shallots. In the summertime, yogurt and ice cubes are mixed together with cucumbers, raisins, salt, pepper and onions and topped with some croutons made of Persian traditional bread {{and served as a}} cold soup. Ashe-Mâst is a warm yogurt soup with fresh herbs, <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> lentils. Even the leftover water extracted when straining yogurt is cooked to make a sour cream sauce called kashk, which is usually used as a topping on soups and stews.|$|E

25|$|Independent of {{nitric oxide}} synthase, an {{alternative}} pathway, coined the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, elevates nitric oxide through the sequential reduction of dietary nitrate derived from plant-based foods. Nitrate-rich vegetables, in particular leafy greens, such as <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> arugula, and beetroot, {{have been shown}} to increase cardioprotective levels of nitric oxide with a corresponding reduction in blood pressure in pre-hypertensive persons. For the body to generate nitric oxide through the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, the reduction of nitrate to nitrite (by nitrate reductase, a bacterial enzyme) occurs in the mouth, by commensal bacteria, an obligatory and necessary step. Monitoring nitric oxide status by saliva testing detects the bioconversion of plant-derived nitrate into nitric oxide. A rise in salivary levels is indicative of diets rich in leafy vegetables which are often abundant in anti-hypertensive diets such as the DASH diet.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who managed}} to pass the {{controls}} did not begin lives of relaxation in Switzerland. By the end of 1916, there were 16,637 French and Belgian prisoners interned, 1,866 British, and 8,487 German and Austrian. These figures remained fairly steady {{through the rest of}} the war: on 1 May 1917, for example, there were 13,640 French internees. They were accommodated in hotels, boarding houses and sanatoria. At the beginning, meals were a great improvement on camp offerings: “Morning, 7 o’clock, we had café au lait, jam, and 225 grams of bread for the day. Noon, soupe grasse, beef, potatoes, salad and coffee. Evening, at 6:30, soupe légère, beef tongue in sauce, potatoes, <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> rhubarb in compote”. The home countries of those interned in Switzerland had to continue to pay for the prisoners’ upkeep. France, for example, had to pay four francs per soldier per day, and six for officers (tuberculosis patients cost five and eight francs respectively). The situation rapidly deteriorated, especially with respect to food, which became insufficient. The restrictions, characteristic of those in the camps, were highly resented by the prisoners. French detainees pointed the blame at their own government.|$|E
500|$|String hoppers, {{which are}} made of rice flour and look like knitted {{vermicelli}} neatly laid out in circular pieces about [...] in diameter, are frequently combined with tomato sothi (a soup) and curries for breakfast and dinner. Another common item is puttu, a granular, dry, but soft steamed rice powder cooked in a bamboo cylinder with the base wrapped in cloth so that the bamboo flute can be set upright over a clay pot of boiling water. This can be transformed into varieties such as ragi, <b>spinach,</b> <b>and</b> tapioca puttu. There are also sweet and savoury puttus. Another popular breakfast or dinner dish is Appam, a thin crusty pancake made with rice flour, with a round soft crust in the middle. It has variations such as egg or milk Appam.|$|E

500|$|From the 8th century, {{the medieval}} Islamic world {{underwent}} a transformation in agricultural practice, {{described by the}} historian Andrew Watson as the Arab Agricultural Revolution. This transformation was driven {{by a number of}} factors including the diffusion of many crops and plants along Muslim trade routes, the spread of more advanced farming techniques, and an agricultural-economic system which promoted increased yields and efficiency. The shift in agricultural practice changed the economy, population distribution, vegetation cover, agricultural production, population levels, urban growth, the distribution of the labour force, cooking, diet, and clothing across the Islamic world. Muslim traders covered much of the Old World, and trade enabled the diffusion of many crops, plants and farming techniques across the region, as well as the adaptation of crops, plants and techniques from beyond the Islamic world. This diffusion introduced major crops to Europe by way of Al-Andalus, along with the techniques for their cultivation and cuisine. Sugar cane, rice, and cotton were among the major crops transferred, along with citrus and other fruit trees, nut trees, vegetables such as aubergine, <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> chard, and the use of [...] spices such as cumin, coriander, nutmeg and cinnamon. Intensive irrigation, crop rotation, and agricultural manuals were widely adopted. Irrigation, partly based on Roman technology, made use of noria water wheels, water mills, dams and reservoirs.|$|E
500|$|Vulović {{underwent}} {{treatment in}} a Prague hospital until 12 March 1972, after {{which she was}} flown to Belgrade. She was offered a hypnotic injection to help her sleep during the flight back to Yugoslavia, but declined, explaining {{that she was not}} afraid of flying because she had no memory of the crash. In Belgrade, Vulović's hospital room was placed under 24-hour police protection because the authorities feared that the perpetrators of the bombing would want to kill her. The guards changed shifts every six hours, and no one was allowed in to see her except for her parents and doctors. Her hospitalization in Belgrade lasted until June 1972, after which she travelled to Montenegro to recuperate at a seaside resort, where her doctors visited her every two or three days. Vulović underwent several operations to restore her movement. At first, she could only move her left leg, and one month thereafter, she was once again able to move her right. Within ten months of her fall, Vulović had regained the ability to walk, but continued to limp {{for the rest of her}} life, her spine permanently twisted by the fall.
