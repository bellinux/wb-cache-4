5|$|Though {{not highly}} {{dangerous}} to humans, the pink whipray's venomous sting {{makes it difficult}} to handle when it is thrashing in a fishing net. Usually, it must be thrown overboard before the rest of the catch can be sorted. Throughout Indonesia and Malaysia, and probably elsewhere in its range, this species is a regular incidental catch of coastal fisheries using tangle nets, bottom trawls, gillnets, <b>seine</b> <b>nets,</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} longlines. When retained, the meat, skin, and cartilage are utilized. Fishing activity in Southeast Asia is intense and largely unregulated, and this large ray may be more vulnerable to depletion than its smaller relatives because of its slower reproductive rate. The population in the Arafura Sea is thought to have been particularly affected by an Indonesian fishery targeting wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus), and Indonesian fishers are also increasingly operating illegally in Australian waters. Off northern Australia, the pink whipray is caught incidentally by the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), but bycatch levels have likely fallen significantly since the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) became compulsory in 2000.|$|E

Advances include double trawls, the Puretic power blocks for {{retrieving}} <b>seine</b> <b>nets,</b> refrigerated holds, durable synthetic fibres for lines and nets, GPS to navigate and locate fishing grounds, fishfinders for the location of fish, and spotter planes to locate fish schools.|$|E
25|$|The {{schooling}} behaviour of fish is exploited on {{an industrial}} scale by the commercial fishing industry. Huge purse seiner vessels use spotter planes to locate schooling fish, such as tuna, cod, mackerel and forage fish. They can capture huge schools by rapidly encircling them with purse <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> {{with the help}} of fast auxiliary boats and sophisticated sonar, which can track the shape of the shoal.|$|E
25|$|The {{family is}} highly {{important}} to fisheries throughout the Indo-Pacific, with {{species such as}} the northern whiting, Japanese whiting, and King George whiting forming the basis of major fisheries throughout their range. Many species are also of major importance to small subsistence fisheries, while others {{are little more than}} occasional bycatch. Smelt-whitings are caught by a number of methods, including trawling, <b>seine</b> <b>nets,</b> and cast nets. In Australia and Japan in particular, members of the family are often highly sought by recreational fishermen who also seek the fish for their prized flesh.|$|E

However, as more powerful engines became available, sails (apart from the mizzen sail) were dispensed with. Danish <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> boats were landing huge quantities of plaice and other white fish at English east coast ports.

John Campbell, nephew of William Campbell who designed the first Zulu boat, saw that a new design was needed to accommodate the large amounts of white fish that could be caught.

25|$|The main {{commercial}} King George whiting {{fishery is}} centred on South Australia from Ceduna {{in the west}} to Gulf St Vincent in the east. Smaller fisheries are present in Victoria and south west Western Australia. Common catching practices include haul <b>seine</b> <b>nets,</b> gill nets as well as longline and handline methods. This fishery {{is one of the most}} important in the country, reportedly worth five million Australian dollars a year, as King George whiting fetch premium price in markets. This single species alone was reported as comprising 60% of the total annual catch in South Australia during the late 1980s. The fish are sold either whole or as fillets and are generally rated as one of the very best quality Australian fish for the table.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} whiting, Sillago sihama (also {{known as}} the silver whiting and sand smelt), is a marine fish, the most widespread and abundant member of the smelt-whiting family Sillaginidae. The northern whiting was the first species of sillaginid scientifically described and is therefore the type species of both the family Sillaginidae and the genus Sillago. The species is distributed in the Indo-Pacific region from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan and Indonesia in the east, also becoming an invasive species to the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal. The northern whiting inhabits coastal areas to 60 m, but is most often found in shallow water around bays and estuaries, often entering freshwater. It is a carnivore, taking a variety of polychaetes and crustaceans. The species is of major economic importance throughout the Indo-Pacific. It is most frequently taken by <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> and cast nets and marketed fresh.|$|E
50|$|The club-foot whiting is {{commonly}} taken by <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> throughout its range and is generally sold fresh in local markets alongside {{other species of}} sillaginid. Small subsidence fisheries in India are known to take substantial amounts of the species as well.|$|R

The time and position of each haul was recorded and all fish caught were transferred to the survey boat where the species and total length of each individual was determined. 14, 024 individuals were landed, with a total weight of 5, 592 kg. The catches comprised of 72 fish species. The most important species within the catch were the Rabbitfish (Cordonnier) Siganus sutor and the Goatfish (Rouget), Mulloidichthys flavolineatus. The Emperor (Capitaine) Lethrinus nebulosus, Surgeonfish (Lorsan) Acanthurus triostegus, Mojarra (Breton) Gerres longirostris, Trevally (Carangue) Caranx melampygus, Mullet Valamugil seheli and Unicornfish (Corne), Naso unicornis were also important components of <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> catches. Comparisons with catch statistics from 2002 - 2004 show that S. sutor, remained the most important species in all 4 years.

25|$|The bumpnose trevally, Carangoides hedlandensis (also {{known as}} the bumpnose {{kingfish}} and onion kingfish) is a species of relatively small inshore marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The bumpnose trevally is fairly common in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-west Pacific region, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan and Samoa in the east. It is a small species by carangid standards, reaching a maximum known length of 32cm, and can be distinguished from the similarly shaped Carangoides armatus by a distinct 'bump' on the snout, which gives the fish its common name. The species inhabits coastal waters, often living along bays and beaches, where it takes shrimp, small crabs, and juvenile fish as prey. The bumpnose trevally is of minor importance to fisheries throughout its range, taken by hook and line, trawls, and <b>seine</b> <b>nets.</b> It is also of minor importance to anglers, taken by baits from beaches and piers, and is considered a modest table fish.|$|E
25|$|The false scad, Caranx rhonchus (also {{known as}} the spotfin scad, ten-finned horse {{mackerel}} and yellow horse mackerel), is a species of medium-sized marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The false scad is distributed throughout the tropical and temperate waters of the eastern Atlantic Ocean from Namibia {{in the south to}} Spain and throughout most of the Mediterranean in the north. The species has an atypical body form compared to other species of Caranx, and can be distinguished from these on its elongate 'scad-like' body shape alone. Distinguishing the species from members of Decapterus and Trachurus is more difficult, requiring detailed anatomical analysis. The false scad is known to grow to a length of 60cm and a weight of 1 kg. The species lives both pelagically and demersally in continental shelf waters, ranging from depths of 15 to 200 m. It is a predatory fish, taking small fishes, crustaceans including euphausiids and shrimps, and cephalopods as its main prey, with significant dietary shifts as it ages. The false scad reaches sexual maturity at 2 years of age, with spawning occurring between April and July in shallow inshore waters, where the juveniles remain. The species is of major importance to fisheries throughout its range, but particularly from Morocco to Senegal, with annual catches ranging from 500 to 19000 t. The species is caught using trawls, <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> and gill nets and sold fresh, frozen or salted.|$|E
500|$|Salmon populations {{declined}} dramatically {{after the}} establishment of canneries in 1867. In 1879 {{it was reported that}} 545,450 salmon, with an average weight of [...] were caught (in a recent season) and mainly canned for export to England. A can weighing [...] could be sold for 8d or 9d. By 1908, there was widespread concern about the decline of salmon and sturgeon. In that year, the people of Oregon passed two laws under their newly instituted program of citizens' initiatives limiting fishing on the Columbia and other rivers. Then in 1948, another initiative banned the use of <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> (devices already used by Native Americans, and refined by later settlers) altogether.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} couple of decades, the old Brahmaputra River, one of the ancient river systems of Bangladesh, has fallen in verge of {{biodiversity}} changes affecting its range of fauna and flora. Study was, therefore, conducted to investigate the selectivity of fish species caught by different fishing gears used in the old Brahmaputra River system over a period of 1 year. L 50 % of different gears was determined mainly for dominant species where 41 fish species were recorded. Highest L 50 % was recorded in gill net (fash jal) followed by basket trap (vair) whereas lowest value was recorded for <b>seine</b> <b>net.</b> <b>Seine</b> <b>net,</b> cast net, sidi bair and hand line (borshi) were considered non selective gears where fash jal and sidi bair were regarded as gear specific for large fish species and koi jal, ber jal, dharma jal, howra bair and koach were considered specific for small species. Among all the gears, <b>seine</b> <b>net,</b> cast net, koi jal and howra bair were found to be harmful for small species of fishes. Monofilamentous gill net (current jal) although marked as banned gear, was found to be operated in the river and causing considerable damage to the fish stock. Fash jal was considered as harmful gear for catfish as it was found to be used to catch fishes below legal size. It is suggested that fash jal should be restricted for several months, which may allow the newly stock fingerlings to grow to market size...|$|R
500|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} {{taken by a}} number of fishing methods, with the most common being <b>seine</b> <b>nets.</b> Ring, fence, fyke netting and beam trawling are also used occasionally, but more often associated with sampling the entire population for research purposes. [...] Research has focused on the effectiveness of different mesh sizes used to net the species in order to prevent juvenile individuals dying after becoming enmeshed. Associated research has also shown that those whiting that survive and are discarded tend to have much lower survival rates due to scale loss, which is a major issue, as many young fish are regularly taken in such nets and released by the fisherman after sustaining scale loss. These studies have led to a number of proposals and subsequent changes to net regulations.|$|E

2500|$|Sillaginids {{are taken}} {{by a variety of}} fishing methods, with inshore catches {{predominantly}} taken using beach <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> and cast nets.

In deeper waters, commercial trawlers and longliners take the most fish, with a number of sillaginids taken in prawn trawls as bycatch. The fish are normally marketed fresh locally under various names, with [...] "Ashuos" [...] commonly used in many countries for various sillaginids.

2500|$|Preying {{mainly on}} polychaete worms, the eastern shovelnose stingaree is rather common in very shallow, coastal bays over fine substrates, {{though it does}} range {{to a depth of}} [...] or more. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with the females {{supplying}} their unborn young with histotroph ("uterine milk"). The gestation period for the embryos lasts 47 months, though this is preceded by a prolonged period during which the eggs are maintained under suspended development. Females produce litters of up to seven pups annually, from late February to April. This species is caught incidentally by inshore commercial fisheries using <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> and bottom trawls, and may be additionally impacted by habitat degradation and invasive species. Its numbers are known to have declined in Port Phillip, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.|$|E
60|$|At {{considerable}} sea-port towns, {{where there}} is an unusually large supply of men, boats, and nets, such figures as those quoted above, are far below the mark.

40|$|The {{conservation}} of the Oxleyan Pygmy Perch Nannoperca oxleyana {{would benefit from}} {{the adoption of a}} standardised, non-destructive sampling protocol that effectively and efficiently detects the presence, and quantifies the relative abundance, of extant populations. The objectives of this study were to: (i) quantify the minimum number of traps required to obtain precise relative abundance estimates, (ii) assess the effectiveness and efficiency of various trapping regimes, and (iii) compare the relative detectability and short-term mortality rates of trapping, <b>seine</b> <b>netting</b> and backpack electrofishing. Previous survey data were utilised and augmented with field experiments. Ten traps provided relatively precise estimates of relative abundance. Unbaited and baited traps set for 30 and 60 minutes detected the species on all occasions, whereas traps set for 15 minutes did not. Positive correlations were found between set time and both overall (fish/trap) and standardised (fish/trap/minute) catch rates, although only the former relationship was significant. The addition of bait to traps did not significantly affect catch rates. Trapping, <b>seine</b> <b>netting</b> and electrofishing detection rates were 88 %, 71 % and 83 %, respectively. Associated mortality rates were 10 %, 55 % and 0 %, respectively. The deployment of multiple gear types increased the likelihood of detecting N. oxleyana. A sampling protocol is recommended that includes saturating sites with unbaited traps set for at least 30 minutes and sampling with a backpack electrofisher. <b>Seine</b> <b>netting</b> should be reserved for situations where an electrofisher is unavailable or non-deployable...|$|R
