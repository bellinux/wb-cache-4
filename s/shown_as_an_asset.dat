40|$|The {{accounting}} treatment of corporate income taxes on corporation should reflect {{the system of}} corporate taxation used in the country. This {{is to ensure that}} the accounts would provide the fullest information possible. Advanced corporation tax shows the potential credit to be used for paying dividends. It is a receivable amount to the shareholders. <b>Showing</b> it <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> in the financial statement will provide better information about the financial position of the corporation. It will however violate the basic principle of seperate legal entity in accounting. It is thought that information about the total amount of available credit should be disclosed in the financial statement, at least in the form of notes to the accounts...|$|R
40|$|Hedge {{funds have}} <b>shown</b> {{remarkable}} growth <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> class {{over the past}} few years, with an estimated $ 1 trillion in assets under management in 2004, and this figure expected to double {{in the next five years}} (HFR Report, 2004). The term “hedge fund” has its roots in the idea that high net-worth investors are more interested in protecting themselves from downside risk (i. e. hedging) than the conventional theories of risk and return might suggest. Unlike traditional unit trusts, which tend to be “long only” and measure performance against index type bench marks, hedge funds actively transact, seeking only positive returns, and to do so engage in short selling, derivative products and leveraged positions...|$|R
40|$|Social {{capital has}} been <b>shown</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{positive}} <b>asset</b> for improving overall health {{in children and}} youth. Thus, {{the purpose of the}} present study was to determine the associations between family, neighborhood and school social capital with self-rated health among Serbian high-school students. This cross-sectional study on 1220 high-school students (539 males and 681 females) was carried out in the school year 2015 / 2016. Main outcome was defined as self-rated health, measured by one question: "How would you rate your health?" with five possible answers: (1) very poor; (2) poor, (3) fair, (4) good and (5) excellent. We binarised the outcome, where answers "very poor", "poor" and "fair" represented "poor health" and "good" and "excellent" "good health". Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the associations between social capital domains and self-rated health. Adjusted by gender, body-mass index, self-perceived socioeconomic status, psychological distress and physical activity, good self-rated health was positively associated only with high family social capital (OR 2. 29; 95 % CI 1. 62 to 3. 24). When all the social capital variables were entered simultaneously, self-rated health remained associated with family social capital (OR 2. 28; 95 % CI 1. 61 to 3. 24). Family social capital was the only domain strongly associated with self-rated health. Since neighborhood and school social capital represent key support and empathy for children and youth, neighborhood and school-based strategies and policies should be implemented within the system to increase overall physical and mental health...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} <b>a</b> customer <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> of business in the accommodation industry. The {{purpose of this article}} is to examine the value of guests <b>as</b> <b>a</b> firm <b>asset</b> and to propose a model for managing guests <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> in the context of accommodation services. A guest is considered <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> due to its role in providing revenue to the accommodation firm. Because of this role, the accommodation guest needs to be managed appropriately. This article argues that guest service evaluation (i. e. service quality, perceived value, and guest satisfaction) and service loyalty are important factors in the development of guest lifetime value. The proposed model of managing guests <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> consists of marketing instruments, service evaluation, guest loyalty, and financial outcomes provides a comprehensive guide on how accommodation firms can manage the lifetime value of their guests. Finally, as there are limited studies examining this issue, future research should test the proposed model...|$|R
