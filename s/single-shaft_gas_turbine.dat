In this study, a methodology based on artificial neural network (ANN) tech-niques was developed for offline system identification of a low-power gas turbine.

A comprehensive computer program code was generated and run in MATLAB for cre-ating and training different ANN models with feed-forward multilayer perceptron (MLP) structure. The code consisted of various training functions, different number of neurons as well as a variety of transfer (activation) functions for hidden and output layers of the network. It was shown that the optimal model for a two-layer network with MLP structure consisted of 20 neurons in its hidden layer and used trainlm as its training function, as well as tansig and logsid as its transfer functions for the hidden and output layers. It was also observed that trainlm has a superior performance in terms of minimum mean squared error (MSE) compared with each of the other training functions.
