Bronchiolar strips from 30 patients, 12 of whom had chronic bronchitis, were examined in the organ bath for their responses to histamine, methacholine, and leukotriene (LT) C 4. The same airways were also studied histologically and <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> <b>disease</b> was quantified by subjective grading of the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration, smooth muscle hypertrophy, fibrosis, and goblet cell hyperplasia. The degree of <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> <b>disease</b> varied widely among patients both with and without chronic bronchitis. Multiple regression analysis failed to show increased sensitivity (-log EC 50) to histamine, methacholine, or LTC 4 in relation to <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> <b>disease.</b> In contrast, the only significant correlations found were between a decreased -log EC 50 to histamine and methacholine and an increased <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> <b>disease</b> score.

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{respiratory}} disease, characterized by airway obstruction and inflammation. Increasing {{evidence shows that}} the small airways contribute significantly to the clinical expression and severity of asthma.

Particle size and distribution are of key importance when developing inhaled treatments for <b>small</b> <b>airway</b> <b>disease.</b> The availability of small-particle aerosols such as HFA-ciclesonide and HFA-beclomethasone dipropionate (HFA-BDP) enables a higher drug deposition into the peripheral lung and potentially provides additional clinical benefits compared with large-particle treatment.

40|$|Background: The <b>small</b> {{conducting}} <b>airways</b> are {{the major}} site of airflow obstruction in COPD and may precede emphysema development. We hypothesized a novel CT biomarker of <b>small</b> <b>airways</b> <b>disease</b> predicts FEV 1 decline. Methods: We analyzed 1, 508 current and former smokers from COPDGene with linear regression to assess predictors of change in FEV 1 (ml/year) over 5 years. Separate models for non-obstructed and obstructed subjects were generated using baseline clinical and physiologic predictors in addition to two novel CT metrics created by Parametric Response Mapping (PRM), a technique pairing inspiratory and expiratory CT images to define emphysema (PRMemph) and functional <b>small</b> <b>airways</b> <b>disease</b> (PRMfSAD), a measure of non-emphysematous air trapping. Results: Mean (SD) rate of FEV 1 decline in ml/year for GOLD 0 - 4 was as follows: 41. 8 (47. 7), 53. 8 (57. 1), 45. 6 (61. 1), 31. 6 (43. 6), and 5. 1 (35. 8) respectively (trend test for grades 1 - 4, p< 0. 001). In multivariable linear regression, for non-obstructed participants, PRMfSAD but not PRMemph was associated with FEV 1 decline, p< 0. 001. In GOLD 1 - 4 participants, both functional <b>small</b> <b>airways</b> <b>disease</b> (PRMfSAD) and emphysema (PRMemph) were associated with FEV 1 decline (p< 0. 001 and p= 0. 001, respectively). Based on the model, the proportional contribution of the two CT metrics to FEV 1 decline, relative to each other, was 87 % vs. 13 % and 68 % vs. 32 % for PRMfSAD and PRMemph in GOLD 1 / 2 and 3 / 4, respectively. Conclusions: Both CT assessed functional <b>small</b> <b>airways</b> <b>disease</b> and emphysema are associated with FEV 1 decline, but the association with functional <b>small</b> <b>airways</b> <b>disease</b> has greatest importance in mild-to-moderate stage COPD where the rate of FEV 1 decline is the greatest...|$|R

We compared clinical, bronchoalveolar lavage, physiological, imaging and pathological findings between primary and secondary Sjögren’s syndrome.

Air trapping on HRCT negatively correlated with MEF 50 and MEF 25. Although lymphoid cell infiltration and peribronchiolar fibrosis were the most common pathologies, constrictive change scores correlated negatively with MEF 50 and MEF 25, positively with air trapping scores and negatively with improvements after therapy in MEF 50, MEF 25 and air trapping.
