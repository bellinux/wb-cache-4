500|$|The game's {{graphics}} {{received a}} mediocre response, with GameSpot commenting that the presentation is [...] "starting to <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> antiquated" [...] when {{noting that the}} character models {{did not seem to}} have been updated from Mario Party 4. Despite this, IGN commented that Mario Party 5 [...] "isn't a bad looking game", noting the level of detail and variety given to the game's board game's and maps. GameSpot noted that the game's audio did fit the game, although they commented that it [...] "is largely recycled from Mario Party 4". IGN criticized the [...] "cheesy" [...] and unadventurous soundtrack, as well as a lack of voice acting. The game won the Console Children's Award at the 2004 Interactive Achievement Awards.|$|E
500|$|UPN {{requested}} a modified ending to the episode, {{as the original}} version had Phlox and Archer disagreeing {{over what to do}} with the Valakians. Archer would have wanted to save the race, while Phlox would have wanted evolution to take its course. John Billingsley, who played Doctor Phlox in Enterprise, didn't agree with the changed version, saying [...] "the ending that had initially been created I was fairly comfortable with. But the head of the studio suggested some revisions on the ending. What do you do? I wasn't as happy with the revisions, but it's not my show, you have to sort of adjust, even if sometimes it does <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a contradiction in terms for what your character is supposed to be about." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+. He praised the storytelling, positively commenting {{on how it}} revolved around Skinner and his past life. In addition he wrote that the episode possessed some [...] "good scares". However, {{he felt that the}} [...] "central paranormal mystery of the episode is handled in a fashion that feels a bit muddled". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately negative review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode fails to capitalize on the idea of delving into the world of Walter Skinner. The conspiracy elements <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> redundant, and the paranormal side of the episode is a forced and inconsistent mess. Instead of developing something unique about Skinner, the episode dwells on what is already known or suggested, leaving the character in the same emotional place at the end as in the beginning." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Avatar" [...] a D+, describing it as [...] "ridiculous" [...] and saying, [...] "The clench-toothed Skinner deserves more air time, but not this USA Network reject".|$|E
500|$|... "From This Moment On" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Matt Bjorke of About.com deemed the song {{as one of}} the album's highlights, while Elizabeth Kessler of Yahoo! commented that [...] "hardly any song can compare to this love anthem! ... Everyone feels their insides tug as they listen to this heart wrenching song." [...] Country Universe writer Kevin John Coyne did separate reviews for [...] "From This Moment On". While reviewing the duet, Coyne graded it a B and commented that it was mostly a showcase of White's vocals, [...] "who turns in some signature licks and makes Twain <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> bland in comparison. [...] However, it also gives the song a bit of a mid-eighties Peter Cetera vibe, which hasn’t held up well over time." [...] Coyne concluded, however, that the single release turned the track [...] "into a potent solo number," [...] and noted that [...] "the addition of a Spanish-flavored guitar that borrowed heavily from 'Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman' [...] gave the ballad added oomph." [...] He graded the single release at an A-. At the 1999 Canadian Country Music Awards, [...] "From This Moment On" [...] won the award for Vocal/Instrumental Collaboration of the Year.|$|E
500|$|Phantasmagoria {{received}} mixed reviews. Vince Broady, {{executive editor}} of Multimedia World, said Sierra was smart to try to capture the adult market, which was looking for sophisticated games especially after the popularity of games such as The 7th Guest. Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle declared it the best game of the year, calling it a [...] "masterwork" [...] and [...] "as close as it gets to a film you control", although he said not everyone would appreciate it due to its violent content. Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ and called it [...] "one of the surest signs yet of computer games approaching the quality level of the movies". The review said it had some suspenseful and novel twists, but also some [...] "horrific touches (that) <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> derivative, such as a Freddy Krueger-like nightmare in which hands pull you through a bed". Kim McDaniel of The Salt Lake Tribune called it [...] "the most sophisticated computer game to date" [...] and [...] "a weird, wild, horrific ride {{that will make you}} jump at every turn, even if you aren't normally faint-of-heart". Although McDaniel said it might be easy for experienced gamers, she appreciated that it was more accessible for casual gamers than difficult games like The 7th Guest.|$|E

500|$|In 1947, Havelock {{moved to}} Cambridge, Massachusetts, {{to take a}} {{position}} at Harvard University, where he remained until 1963. He was active in a number of aspects of the University and of the department, of which he became chair; he undertook a translation of and commentary on Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound for the benefit of his students. [...] He published this translation, with an extended commentary on Prometheus and the myth's implications for history, under the title The Crucifixion of Intellectual Man (and then changed it back to Prometheus when the book was republished in the 1960s, saying that the earlier title had [...] "come to <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> pretentious"). During this time he began his first major attempt to argue for a division between Platonic or Aristotelian philosophy and what came before. His focus was on political philosophy and, in particular, the beginnings of Greek liberalism as introduced by Democritus. In his book The Liberal Temper in Greek Politics, he argued that for Democritus and the liberals, political theory was based on an understanding of [...] "the behaviour of man in a cosmic and historical setting": that is, humanity defined as the poets would define it—measured through its individual actions. Plato and Aristotle were interested in the nature of humanity and, in particular, the idea that human actions might be rooted in inherent qualities rather than consisting of individual choices.|$|E
500|$|Seili has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Most of the reviewers have been {{appreciative of the}} vocals and the successful combination of synthpop and darker ballads, but more or less critical with the notable contrast between the thumping pop song [...] "Nettiin" [...] {{and the rest of}} the album and Vartiainen's lack of peculiarity. Teemu Fiilin of the magazine Rumba gave Seili three out of five stars, saying that [...] "Seili follows pretty much the schlager-ish pattern of a poet girl's inflated electro-pop". He complimented [...] "En haluu kuolla tänä yönä" [...] as [...] "a brilliant pop song, suitable to be sung by a [...] 27-year-old Jenni Vartiainen who is enjoying her life". Due to the accompaniment of the more poetical, dramatical and mature songs written by Mariska, Fiilin considered [...] "Nettiin" [...] "a really epic fail" [...] that [...] "would be a lot of fun if performed by Tea Hiilloste on Kids Top 20". He thought [...] "Duran Duran" [...] is also brilliant, but considered Vartiainen to be more talented with faster songs, because she, when singing melancholic songs, [...] "lags kilometers behind [...] Chisu". The pop rock magazine Stara said the album is not as good at first hearing as Vartiainen's debut Ihmisten edessä, but it gave the album four out five stars. The magazine complimented the aggregate of [...] "En haluu kuolla tänä yönä" [...] and the beauty and elegance of [...] "Duran Duran". Stara was less harsh on reviewing the inclusion of [...] "Nettiin", saying the Western-themed sounds <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> odd, but that the song is good in its entirety.|$|E
500|$|Mother Gothel has {{garnered}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} film critics. Nigel Andrews of the Financial Times {{felt that the}} character was given the film's [...] "best lines and tunes". Film4 described Gothel as a [...] "fun" [...] character [...] "to the extent that she risks making the good guys <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> dull." [...] Hailing Gothel as the film's [...] "pièce de résistance", Georgie Hobbs of Little White Lies wrote that Gothel [...] "performs ... 'Mother Knows Best' ... with a schizophrenic frenzy worthy {{of the very best}} of [...] Sondheim's crazed heroines". IGN's Jim Vejvoda penned, [...] "Mother Gothel nearly steals the show, with her overprotective tyranny being made to seem almost rational". Dubbed Disney's [...] "first passive-aggressive villain" [...] by Helen O'Hara of Empire, the author reviewed, [...] "the fact that [...] is entirely bereft of superpowers and reliant on her considerable wits to keep her going makes her strangely admirable". Writing for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Cathy Jakicic called the character [...] "a great contemporary villain" [...] who [...] "many daughters (and mothers) will find ... funny and a little too familiar". In The New York Times A. O. Scott's opinion, [...] "The Disney pantheon is full of evil stepmothers, though none quite match Mother Gothel for sheer sadistic intensity." [...] According to Jake Coyle of the Southtown Star, Gothel is [...] "one of Disney's best" [...] villains, while Gary Thompson of the Philadelphia Daily News dubbed the character [...] "one reason to love Disney". Michael Smith of the Tulsa World reviewed Gothel as [...] "perfectly wicked as she kills Rapunzel's dreams". Kirk Baird of The Blade identified Gothel as the film's [...] "strongest character". Colin Covert of the Star Tribune commented, [...] "In her own way, Gothel is scarier than Snow White's wicked stepmother" [...] because the character [...] "doesn't cast spells; she's fully capable of manipulating, guilt-tripping and emotionally undermining the girl". Several comparisons have been made between Gothel and the Evil Queen in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), while several critics observed the character's likeness to singer Cher; Peter Howell of the Toronto Star joked that Gothel is [...] "suspiciously Cher-like in her quest for eternal youth".|$|E

AdvertisingAge.com gave the series a favorable review stating [...] "...each episode of 'LXD' packs a wealth of narrative sophistication into its eight or nine minutes.

2500|$|The Paris production's splendid décor, ingenious round dances, and {{its large}} and superbly schooled corps de ballet {{astonished}} and delighted audiences, which {{had yet to}} behold anything quite so marvellous. While there was likely nothing profound in the ballet's theme, {{for the first time}} there was an integrated conception of costume, décor, properties, and movement subordinated {{to the development of a}} stage picture, and theatre-goers attended to see the ballet as such, not the virtuoso in vogue. Musical instruments such as the triangle and cymbal ("Turkish music") were first introduced in the ballet though it is not certain whether they were played in the orchestra or only used as stage properties. [...] The costumes were designed by Louis-René Boquet, who forsook the traditional ballet uniform of Roman armour with applied bits of Chinese decoration for full-scale and realistic Chinese costumes. The décor was created by Guillet and Moulin and possibly Leuse, after designs by François Boucher. [...] They were worked up into full-scale cartoons by Jean-Joseph Dumons, and woven nine times, first in 1743 and last in 1775, when their rococo pastorale galante would have begun to <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> stale.

2500|$|John Jakala from Anime News Network (ANN) was {{surprised}} by its first chapter because {{of the absence of}} on-screen appearance of the main character on it. He considered it [...] "a daring move" [...] but said [...] "it pays off: I found myself anxious to meet Sakuragi, and curious to see how he will deal with all of the political crises erupting around him." [...] However, Jakala affirmed the first actual appearance of Sakuragi probably would be more impactaful if his face had not been showed on a Jumbotron {{at the end of the}} chapter. [...] "Still, it was a cute bit", he said. The third chapter had [...] "a very powerful" [...] scene about the formation of a lifelong friendship between Sakuragi and a childhood's friend. Jakala deemed it [...] "inspirational without becoming overly sentimental".
