5|$|Although US-89 {{follows the}} I-70 freeway from Sevier to <b>Salina,</b> the old {{alignment}} {{can still be}} driven, and is state-maintained north of Elsinore as SR-258, SR-118 (which overlaps I-70 Business through Richfield), SR-24, and US-50. Both highways stay mainly in the west half of the Sevier River's valley, with the faster I-70/US-89 bypassing the communities that the surface road passes through. Just south of <b>Salina,</b> I-70 curves to the east, rising alongside <b>Salina</b> Creek, and US-89 exits into downtown <b>Salina,</b> where it rejoins its pre-freeway alignment. US-50 overlaps US-89 between I-70 and <b>Salina,</b> following I-70 east and a separate alignment northwest from the area; the short Interstate 70 Business also uses this roadway as a business spur from I-70 to the city. North of <b>Salina,</b> US-89 bypasses Redmond (SR-256 follows the former route through the town) and passes through Centerfield to Gunnison, where it meets SR-28 and finally {{turns away from the}} Sevier River.|$|E
5|$|Construction resumed in 1901 on {{a portion}} of the {{southern}} route, to build a spur line to service coal mines on the Wasatch Plateau. The railroad branched from an existing line at <b>Salina</b> and traveled east up <b>Salina</b> Canyon. After the mines closed, the railroad bed was used to improve State Route 10, between <b>Salina</b> and Fremont Junction. I-70 would later use the railroad bed for a path across the Wasatch Plateau.|$|E
5|$|At {{the eastern}} edge of the village center, NY31 and NY370 split, with NY31 {{retaining}} the Genesee Street name and heading northeast towards Oneida Lake. NY370, meanwhile, travels southeast on <b>Salina</b> Street, loosely paralleling the Erie Canal as it heads toward Syracuse. The route intersects NY631 before leaving Baldwinsville and heading into another rural section of Lysander. This open stretch ends at the canalside hamlet of Cold Springs, which serves as the beginning of the Syracuse suburbs. After passing through the community, NY370 crosses over the conjoined Erie Canal and Seneca River and enters the town of <b>Salina.</b> Not far from the canal is a junction with John Glenn Boulevard, a four-lane arterial connecting NY370 to Interstate690 (I-690).|$|E

5|$|With {{an absence}} of {{vertical}} wind shear, the depression drifted just south of due east and steadily organized. The system developed banding features and a central dense overcast, and early on October 6 the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was named Pauline while located about 295miles (475km) south-southeast of <b>Salina</b> Cruz, Oaxaca. A strong high pressure system eroded the trough over southeastern Mexico, which turned Pauline to the northeast. An eye feature developed late on October 6, and early the next day Pauline intensified into a hurricane about 265miles (425km) southeast of <b>Salina</b> Cruz after turning {{to the north and}} northwest.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance left Central America on September 22. Despite some wind shear, the system gradually became better organized and a tropical depression formed September 26, being upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} several hours later. The cyclone immediately moved north. Instead of strengthening into a hurricane before landfall as forecasted, Olaf weakened due to its proximity to land. On September 29, Olaf made landfall near <b>Salina</b> Cruz, Oaxaca.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance {{south of the}} Gulf of Tehuantepec became better organized on June 29 and became a tropical depression. Strengthening was very limited as the depression was approaching to land. It made landfall later that day very near of <b>Salina</b> Cruz, Oaxaca.

Palacios relates that Margaret Riley was his great-grandmother. Minnie Light married Antonio G. <b>Salinas,</b> later Sheriff of Webb County, Texas. Together, Antonio and Minnie had five children: Juan Light <b>Salinas,</b> Jose Maria <b>Salinas,</b> Mucia <b>Salinas</b> (the author's mother), Margarita <b>Salinas,</b> and Antonio Light <b>Salinas.</b> Palacios explains in Tio Cowboy that the eldest and {{the youngest of the}} children, Juan Light <b>Salinas</b> and Antonio Light <b>Salinas</b> (grandnephews of Doc Middleton), became prolific rodeo performers in the tie-down calf roping event, eventually joining the national circuit and making every rodeo they could from about 1936 to 1949. They attended every finals rodeo at Madison Square Garden from 1936 to 1946. They were never world champions but they won their share and earned a very comfortable living in their sport. Juan Light <b>Salinas</b> was inducted into the National Cowboy Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 1992. Juan <b>Salinas</b> and Doc Middleton never met each other, but coincidentally, decades apart of course, both performed at the rodeo at Frontier Days in Cheyenne, Wyoming, [...] "The Daddy of Them All." ...|$|R
5|$|C. diaphanus is {{the only}} species of fairy shrimp to occur {{naturally}} in Great Britain; Tanymastix stagnalis is found in western Ireland, and Artemia <b>salina</b> formerly occurred in England.

5|$|I-70 {{serves as}} the main {{thoroughfare}} of the valley, the only area traversed by the freeway in the state {{with more than a}} few hundred residents. Richfield is the largest city along I-70 in the state. The highway enters the valley just north of Big Rock Candy Mountain, a mountain named for a song attributed to Harry McClintock. The highway proceeds northeast along {{the western edge of the}} valley, passing to the west of the communities of the valley, including Joseph, Monroe, Elsinore, and Richfield. As I-70 approaches <b>Salina</b> it cuts across the valley passing to the south of that town. The highway avoids the downtown areas of all of these cities. The portion between Richfield and <b>Salina</b> is the busiest, with an annual average daily traffic of 11,535vehicles in 2006. In the Sevier Valley, I-70 was built parallel to U.S. Route 89.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the storm, the government of Mexico issued a hurricane warning from Puerto Arista to Punta Maldonaldo and later from <b>Salina</b> Cruz to Acapulco. A tropical storm warning was also issued from Sipacate, Guatemala to Puerto Arista, Mexico. The threat of the hurricane prompted officials to order the evacuation of 3,000people along the southern coast of Mexico to 500 emergency shelters.|$|E

5|$|The homes cease {{temporarily}} around NY598's intersection with NY290 (James Street), {{a prominent}} retail corridor in eastern Syracuse. Upon crossing NY290, NY598 becomes North Midler Avenue {{as it becomes}} surrounded by houses once more. At the Syracuse city line three blocks to the north, North Midler Avenue splits off to the northeast while NY598 becomes New Court Avenue. The switch in both the town of DeWitt and name also brings about a switch in surroundings as the route heads northwest into a heavily industrial area built up along CSX's Mohawk Subdivision rail line. NY598 ends shortly afterward at an intersection with NY298 just inside the <b>Salina</b> town line. The portion of NY598 in DeWitt and <b>Salina</b> is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); {{the remainder of the}} route is maintained by the city of Syracuse.|$|E
5|$|K-140's route was {{established}} in 1925 as U.S. Route 40S. By 1936, the route had become the primary route of US-40, with the old US-40N becoming U.S. Route 24. By 1969, after the majority of Interstate 70 had been completed, US-40 was rerouted to be concurrent with the newly constructed highway, and the old route of US-40 between Ellsworth and <b>Salina</b> was resigned as K-140. The routing of K-140 has remained unchanged since. The K-140 route has been a paved road since at least 1932.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{tropical}} storms or hurricanes made landfall. One of the two tropical depressions of the season, Five-E, came ashore near <b>Salina</b> Cruz, Mexico, {{on the last day}} of June. The depression caused the only fatality of the season, injured five hundred, with two people missing. Delores, Ignacio and Marty threatened the coast of Mexico, coming close enough to require tropical cyclone watches and warnings. Of these, Ignacio was also responsible for 40 injuries as the system passed just offshore of Lázaro Cárdenas. Public advisories were issued for four other systems due to the threat of heavy rain along the coast.|$|E

5|$|Salinity {{differences}} between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by green algae or cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) tint the water south of the causeway a greenish color. North of the causeway, the lake is dominated by Dunaliella <b>salina,</b> a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color, and the bacteria converts non-toxic mercury into toxic methyl mercury, which then flows into the Southern portion of the lake in a heavy brine layer through the causeway.|$|E

At the beginning of the 19th century, land travel along the Nine Mile Creek was very difficult and most travel between Marcellus and the settlements along Onondaga Lake was by water. In 1831 the New York State Legislature authorized the construction of a road to follow Nine Mile Creek from Marcellus towards the town of <b>Salina</b> at Onondaga Lake.|$|E
5|$|All of Midler Avenue, {{including}} {{the portion of}} the street not currently part of NY598 in DeWitt, was originally designated as NY433 in the early 1950s. At the time, NY433 ended at the junction of Midler Avenue and Court Street Road (then NY298). By 1954, New Court Avenue, an east–west connector between NY298 and NY433 in DeWitt, was designated as NY436. In the late 1950s, construction began on a bypass of Court Street that extended from the western terminus of NY436 in <b>Salina</b> to the junction of NY298 and Thompson Road (modern NY635) in DeWitt. The bypass was opened to traffic as a realignment of NY298 by 1961.

Upon regaining tropical storm status on June 1, the governments of Guatemala and Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from Sipacate, Guatemala to Barra de Tonala, Mexico. Later, as the track became more apparent, the watch was replaced by a tropical storm warning, and a tropical storm watch was extended westward to <b>Salina</b> Cruz, Mexico. Officials in Mexico allocated emergency funds for southern regions of Chiapas and Oaxaca in preparation for a potential flooding disaster.
