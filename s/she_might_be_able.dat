5|$|Taylor {{was named}} to the Aussie Belles that was going to the 2012 Summer Paralympics. That the team {{qualified}} for the Games came as a surprise, as the Australian Paralympic Committee had been working on player development with an idea of the team qualifying for the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and an Australian team had not participated since the 2000 Summer Paralympics, when they earned an automatic selection as hosts, and the team finished last in the competition. Going into the Paralympics, her team was ranked eighth in the world. The Australian Paralympic Committee had chosen to work on her development as a goalball player with the idea that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to qualify for and win a medal at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. Taylor debuted the national team's Paralympic uniform on 1 May 2012 at the Sydney Overseas Passenger Terminal on day two of the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia Spring/Summer 2012/13. In the 2012 Summer Paralympics tournament, the Belles played games against Japan, Canada, the United States and Sweden. They lost every game, and did not advance to the finals.|$|E

25|$|Tunny rendezvoused with Skate on 23 June {{to depart}} the Sea of Japan. She {{remained}} off Hokkaidō {{for two days}} on the chance that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to aid Bonefish, missing since her request to make a daylight submerged patrol of Toyama Wan some days earlier.

25|$|The title {{character}} of Babette was initially offered to Catherine Deneuve. Deneuve {{was interested in}} the part but was concerned because she had been criticized in her past attempts to depart from her usual sophisticated woman roles. While Deneuve deliberated for a day, Axel met with French actress Stéphane Audran. Axel remembered Audran from her roles in Claude Chabrol's films Violette Nozière (1978) and Poulet au vinaigre (1985). When Axel asked Chabrol (her former husband) about Audran's suitability, Chabol said Audran was the archetype of Babette. Axel gave the script to Audran, told her that Deneuve was contemplating the role, and asked her if <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to respond before the next day. Audran called two hours later and said she wanted the role. The following day, Deneuve declined and Audran was officially cast.|$|E
25|$|Before the war, Zelle had {{performed}} as Mata Hari {{several times before}} the Crown Prince Wilhelm, eldest son of Kaiser Wilhelm II and nominally a senior German general on the Western Front. The Deuxième Bureau believed <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to obtain information by seducing the Crown Prince for military secrets. In fact, his involvement was minimal and it was German government propaganda that promoted {{the image of the}} Crown Prince as a great warrior, the worthy successor to the august Hohenzollern monarchs who had made Prussia strong and powerful. They wanted to avoid publicizing that the man expected to be the next Kaiser was a playboy noted for womanizing, partying, and indulging in alcohol, who spent another portion of his time intriguing with far right-wing politicians, with the intent to have his father declared insane and deposed.|$|E

2500|$|In {{mathematical}} psychology, antimatroids {{have been}} used to describe feasible states of knowledge of a human learner. Each element of the antimatroid represents a concept that is to be understood by the learner, or a class of problems that he or <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to solve correctly, and the sets of elements that form the antimatroid represent possible sets of concepts that could be understood by a single person. The axioms defining an antimatroid may be phrased informally as stating that learning one concept can never prevent the learner from learning another concept, and that any feasible state of knowledge can be reached by learning a single concept at a time. The task of a knowledge assessment system is to infer the set of concepts known by a given learner by analyzing his or her responses to a small and well-chosen set of problems. In this context antimatroids have also been called [...] "learning spaces" [...] and [...] "well-graded knowledge spaces".|$|E

60|$|De Stancy {{bowed and}} {{departed}} in a glow of triumph; satisfied, notwithstanding her frigidity, {{that he had}} compassed his immediate aim, which <b>was</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to dismiss from her thoughts him and his persevering desire for the shadow of her face during the next four-and-twenty-hours. And his confidence was well founded: she could not.|$|R
60|$|He put {{the child}} into bed wrapped {{as she was}} in the shawl, for the sheets would be cold. Then he <b>was</b> afraid that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to move her arms, so he {{loosened}} her. The black eyes opened, rested on him vacantly, sank shut again. He covered her up. The last little quiver from the sobbing shook her breathing.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{poor woman}} {{that had been a}} kind of a {{dependent}} upon our family, and whom I had often, among the rest of the relations, been very kind to; my maid put it into my head one morning to send to this poor woman, and to see whether <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to help in this dreadful case.|$|R

He was walking beside her in silence. They were very near to each other. She trembled, and he listened, vaguely anxious.|$|R
5000|$|Nessarose and Elphaba {{are almost}} {{diametrically}} opposite {{in terms of}} personality. Elphaba is an atheist, who does not even believe in a soul, and Nessarose ends up provoking her sister's ire by constantly praying for Elphaba's soul. Nevertheless, Nessarose pleads with Elphaba {{to stay with her}} in the East and help her rule Munchkinland, and although Elphaba spurns and abandons her younger sister, she later regrets it when Nessarose is destroyed (wondering whether <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to save Nessie had she herself been there).|$|R
60|$|Fergus {{remained}} {{three months}} at home.

50|$|Class-disadvantaged men {{and women}} {{do not have the}} same {{temporal}} flexibility that allows them to make decisions on how to allocate their time. They face stricter constraints on their work hours and policies, thus making it impossible for them to choose whether to spend more time at work or more time at home. For example, even if a class-disadvantaged woman wanted to spend less time at work and more time with her children or in the home, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> due to the inability to get time off from work or take a leave of absence.|$|R
50|$|In 1970 and 1971 {{the rights}} of {{pregnant}} schoolteachers were called into question. Many schoolteachers were forced to take unpaid maternity leaves around the fourth to sixth month of pregnancy for the reasons that it was potentially dangerous for the mother or child if the woman continued to work, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to focus on teaching, and students would be distracted by the visible signs of pregnancy. In 1974 in Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, the Supreme Court declared mandatory unpaid leave policies unconstitutional This was a big step towards gaining equal rights {{for women in the}} workforce.|$|R
50|$|Julia {{participated in}} a seance to contact Josette's ghost, but she warned Barnabas that, if Josette were truly a {{prisoner}} of the Leviathans, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to appear. After Josette's spirit revealed {{no knowledge of the}} Leviathans, Barnabas decided to take action against Jeb and {{the other members of the}} cult. Julia worried that Barnabas would be punished for fighting the Leviathans, and when Quentin told her that Barnabas had failed to destroy the Naga Box and had not been killed for trying, she decided that Jeb had probably turned Barnabas back into a vampire.|$|R
