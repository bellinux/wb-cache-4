One private carried a plow coulter over his shoulder {{by means of a}} log chain, another had an old-fashioned <b>sausage</b> <b>stuffer</b> for a weapon, while a third shouldered a sheet iron sword about six feet long.|$|E
5000|$|Buck {{promptly}} {{sued the}} board of directors for breach of contract, saying he had given up his lucrative animal collecting business to work in San Diego and had suffered damage to his reputation. He sought $12,500 in salary which he would have received in his three-year contract, as well as $10,000 in damages (a total equivalent to about $312,285 in 2015). He also sued Wegeforth personally, and when the matter went to court in February 1924 Buck accused Wegeforth of interfering with [...] "practically everything" [...] related to his job, and of conspiring with the board to [...] "belittle and disparage" [...] his efforts as director. Wegeforth accused Buck of incompetence and testified that [...] "the whole character of the man was insubordination." [...] Buck also claimed that Wegeforth had killed a sick tiger by dosing the animal with calomel, and that the doctor's experiments in force-feeding snakes with a <b>sausage</b> <b>stuffer</b> had resulted in the deaths of 150 of the reptiles. Wegeforth had in fact administered calomel tablets to a tiger suffering an intestinal ailment in August 1923, and in his memoirs described experimenting with methods of force-feeding Diablo the python before coming up with the idea to tube-feed the snake using a <b>sausage</b> <b>stuffer.</b> Board member Thomas Faulconer and other witnesses, however, suggested that the sick tiger had died after a suspicious blow to the head, and flatly denied the snake-killing accusation. Wegeforth claimed that Buck himself had mistreated the reptiles, saying that he had [...] "stuffed down, by the most inhuman way of feeding, snake meat down the throat of a boa constrictor instead of using a more modern method of stomach tube or feeding the meat through a tube." [...] On February 20, 1924, superior court judge Charles Andrews ruled against Buck and ordered him to pay court costs of $24 (equivalent to about $333 in 2015).|$|E
40|$|A quem a correspondência deve ser enviada The {{microbiological}} quality of beef and meat products is {{strongly influenced by}} the conditions of hygiene prevailing during their production and handling. Without proper hygienic control, the environment in slaughterhouses and butcher shops can act as {{an important source of}} microbiological contamination. To identify the main points of microbiological contamination in the beef processing chain, 443 samples of equipment, installations and products were collected from 11 establishments (1 slaughterhouse and 10 butcher shops) located in the state of Paraná, Brazil. The {{microbiological quality}} of all the samples was evaluated using Petri dishes to obtain counts of mesophilic aerobes (AC), total coliforms, Escherichia coli (EC), yeasts and molds (YM). The main contamination points identified in butcher shops, in decreasing order, were stainless steel boxes, beef tenderizers, grinders, knives, mixers, <b>sausage</b> <b>stuffers,</b> plastic boxes, floors and drains. In the slaughterhouse, these points were <b>sausage</b> <b>stuffers,</b> platforms, floors and drains. The most severely contaminated products were fresh sausages and ground beef. This information about the main points of microbiological contamination in the beef processing chain is expected to aid professionals responsible for hygiene in similar establishments to set up proper hygienic procedures to prevent or reduce microbiological contamination of beef and meat products...|$|R

The Canal was enlarged in 1862, and the Flats, an area adjacent to and east of the village center, grew into a major industrial area, producing fire engines, hose carts and other firefighting equipment, pumps and other iron goods including stove parts, bootjacks, corn shellers, meat choppers, <b>sausage</b> <b>stuffers,</b> flatirons and bells. A knitting mill made socks and once produced 85,000 pairs of socks for the Army and Navy.|$|R
