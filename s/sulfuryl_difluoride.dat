40|$|Sulphuryl fluoride, {{also known}} as <b>sulfuryl</b> <b>difluoride,</b> is being {{registered}} by Dow AgroSciences {{in a number of}} countries for use on food commodities and in food production facilities as the cylinder-based fumigant ProFumeTM. The fumigant is effective against all life stages of insects. Eggs compared to post-embryonic stages are more tolerant of the fumigant, and this needs {{to be taken into account}} for dosing strategies. Crucial factors for limiting egg tolerance are temperature and length of exposure, which operate differently on different species. For example concentration-time products (CTPs) of about 800, 600 and 300 g h/ m 3 killed 95 % of eggs of Rhyzopertha dominica at 20, 25 and 30 oC respectively. At 30 oC, the CTP required for complete kill of eggs fell steadily from 300 g h/m 3 as the exposure time was lengthened from 20 h, only 155 g h m- 3 being required over a 120 h exposure. For Sitophilus granarius, however, concentration rather than time was the more important component of the CTP at 25 oC, except below 15 g m- 3 when exposure times longer than two or three days were encountered. A similar effect was seen for eggs of Ephestia kuehniella. A ‘FumiguideTM Program for ProFumeTM gas fumigant ’ has been developed by Dow to deal with the complexities of the CTP relationship. The dosages prescribed in this computer-based program have been developed from research results and validated through successful commercial fumigations. Sulphuryl fluoride is stable up to 400 oC and can be used safely in conjunction with heating equipment. Electronic equipment including computers have been exposed to accumulative CTPs equivalent to over 30 commercial treatments at 50 oC+ without any observed detrimental effects. Results are also presented demonstrating that the gas is an excellent penetrant though layers of flour while being effectively contained by LDPE sheeting or oil-based paints.

40|$|Seit mehreren Jahren ist Sulfurylfluorid (Sulfuryldifluorid, SF) als Schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel für den Materialschutz und den Vorratsschutz gegen Insekten gelistet. Insbesondere der Ersatz des ozonzerstörenden Brommethans wird in diesen Anwendungsgebieten überwiegend mit diesem Wirkstoff realisiert. Sulfurylfluorid gilt seit langer Zeit als ein bewährtes Begasungsmittel gegen Termiten in Holzhäusern in den Vereinigten Staaten. Als 2005 die Industrienationen gemäß den Beschlüssen des Montrealer Protokolls den Ausstieg aus der Brommethantechnologie umsetzten, gab es Zulassungen für die Leerraumentwesung im Vorratsschutz und Genehmigungen für die Verwendung im Holz- und Materialschutz gegen Insekten. Sulfuryl {{fluoride}} (<b>sulfuryl</b> <b>difluoride,</b> SF) is {{well established}} for termite control in wooden houses as Vikane in the US since 1960. About 10 years ago, the company DowElanco (today DowAgroScience) decided to prepare the authorisation of SF also as replacement fumigant for the envisaged phase out of methyl bromide in 2005. The ozone depleting methyl bromide has in the meantime successfully been replaced by SF in many suitable fields of application. SF started to be used against wood boring insects in Sweden and Germany until it was eventually registered 2005 in many European countries also for stored product protection as Profume. The necessary ct-products (concentration x time of exposure) in the laboratory for effective insect control vary considerably depending on species, developmental stage and temperature. Experimental data require between 14 mgh/l and 1694 mgh/l for lethal treatments at about 25 °C with eggs being the most tolerant stage. In practical mill fumigations ct-products of more than 1800 mgh/l did not always control all included eggs of the insect samples even though the air temperature in the mill had been elevated to 35 °C. It can be expected {{that a combination of}} warming up the object and use of SF may be the approach to meet the high control standards of the food producing industry. New authorisations are expected for various other products than the registered dried fruit and nuts. High purity SF can be used to control insects also in high value wooden artefacts...|$|E
