40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The {{purpose of}} this study is to assist wire {{companies}} to identify buying behaviour amongst consumers of their products. For the {{purpose of this}} study the product will be wire products and the specific target market will be farmers in the Eastern Free State. The primary objective of the study is to identify factors that play a role in the buying behaviour of farmers in the Eastern Free State when purchasing wire products. By knowing exactly the buying criteria of wire products amongst farmers and seasonable cycles of purchasing will form the basis of strategic marketing planning. This study was conducted in two phases. Phase one consisted of a literature review and phase two of an empirical research. The empirical research consisted of a quantitative research design; more specifically, descriptive research that employed cross–sectional analysis of the quantitative data collected from a sample by means of a structured questionnaire. The results show that 76 % of the respondents are older than 41 years of age. The population for this study is, therefore, a more matured one. Regarding their buying behaviour, the purchase frequency shows that the majority purchase wire products on a monthly basis and 40 % on an annual basis. Most of them (78 %) purchase their wire products from the co–operative. Wire products are an integral part of farming activities and in general the respondents are very positive about the industry. Most important considerations identified are that the wire industry should keep in touch with its market, never be out of orders, keep up the fast service that is currently provided, and that reputable products should be kept in <b>stock.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|E

Stock comes off as a brilliant teacher - both brutally honest and sensitive, and able to clearly articulate what works in a photo, what doesn’t, and why." ...|$|R

50|$|On September 10, 1999, Liberty Media Group renamed TCI Music to Liberty Digital Inc.

Liberty Digital lost $244 million with revenue of $66 million in 1999, thanks to investments in struggling Internet businesses homegrocer.com, drugstore.com, TiVo and iVillage.

50|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} a <b>master</b> <b>stock</b> from other stocks is that after initial use, it is not discarded or turned into a soup or sauce. Instead, the broth is stored and reused {{in the future as}} a stock for more poachings sometimes for up to 100 years. With each use, the poached meats and other ingredients absorb the stock's flavour while imparting their own back into the stock. In this way, over time, flavour accumulates in the stock, making it richer and more complex with each poaching, while subsequent poached meats absorb this flavour and likewise become more flavourful.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2011 The {{study is}} based on the time series {{analysis}} of stock prices in South Africa. It uses the data covering the period 1980 Q 1 to 2010 Q 4 to test the effect of inflation on stock prices. The analysis is done using Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL). First, we investigate time series properties of data. The unit root test results reveal stock prices (SP), interest rate (IR), economic growth (GOP) and real effective exchange rate (EXCR) are integrated of order zero - 1 (0), while the growth of money supply (MS) and inflation were found to contain unit root. The Augumented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and the Philips-Perron (PP) tests were used to test for unit root. Causality test suggests that causation runs from inflation to stock prices. Cointegration test shows that there is cointegration and as such, Error Correction Model (EC) is done to establish short-run and long-run dynamics. The study shows that inflation does contribute negatively to <b>stock</b> prices. <b>Master...</b>|$|R

The chicken is then chopped up, and served with a bowl or plate of rice cooked in chicken fat and chicken stock, along with another bowl of clear chicken broth and a set of dips and condiments.

5000|$|Derby Downs, in Akron, Ohio, {{has been}} the home track of the All American Soap Box Derby since it was built as a Works Progress Administration project in the late 1930s. The three-lane asphalt track starts {{near the top of}} George Washington Boulevard and drops in a {{straight}} line down the wooded hill {{in the shadow of the}} Rubber Bowl, ending under final approach for runway 25 of Akron Fulton International Airport. Entry to the facility is through its main gate, which is located at 41.035110, -81.458189. Many people every year come to the [...] "Downs". Before the All American Soap Box Derby even starts they still use the track for the local competitors. During that time they only use two lanes of the three. There are three car categories (divisions) each having a different type of car: Stock, Super <b>Stock,</b> and <b>Masters.</b> They only race their own categories. Each time a competitor has to race down the hill they race twice. Each time they go down it is called a Phase, and two Phases are called a Heat. When going down the track just nudging the steering wheel may cost you the heat. A win is determined by a fraction of a second. Rarely do they ever get a tie or a Dead heat especially during the All American Soap Box Derby.|$|R
