50|$|During World War II, the Royal Australian Navy requisitioned Falie, {{renaming}} her HMAS Falie. Initially she {{was used}} as an inspection vessel. On the night of 31 May, she was acting as a watchdog outside Sydney Harbour when she struck a Japanese midget submarine trying to infiltrate the harbour. Falie was converted in 1943 to a <b>stores</b> <b>vessel,</b> and was deployed to Papua New Guinea, where she saw action landing troops in enemy territory by night.|$|R
50|$|Few facts exist {{concerning}} Susan Ann Howard, a center-board schooner {{purchased by}} the Union Navy from the New York City Prize Court on 19 May 1863. Usually referred to as Susan A.

50|$|One {{system which}} was being {{developed}} by the now bankrupt UK company Isentropic operates as follows. It comprises two insulated containers filled with crushed rock or gravel; a hot <b>vessel</b> <b>storing</b> thermal energy at high temperature and high pressure, and a cold <b>vessel</b> <b>storing</b> thermal energy at low temperature and low pressure. The vessels are connected at top and bottom by pipes and the whole system {{is filled with the}} inert gas argon.|$|R
5000|$|The Dendera {{necropolis}} is {{a series}} of mastaba tombs. The necropolis dates from the Early Dynastic Period of the Old Kingdom to the First Intermediate Period of Egypt. The necropolis runs {{the eastern edge of the}} western hill and over the northern plain. The subterranean Hathor temple tombs total 12 chambers. Some reliefs are dated to as late as the Ptolemy XII Neos Dionysos reign. The crypts reportedly were used for <b>storing</b> <b>vessels</b> and divine iconography. An opening in the [...] "Flame Room" [...] floor leads to a narrow chamber with representations on the walls of the objects which were kept in them. In the second chamber, a relief depicts Pepi I. He offers a statuette of the god Ihy to four images of Hathor. In the crypt, reached from the [...] "throne room", Ptolemy XII has jewelry and offerings for the gods.|$|R

60|$|It was {{not until}} {{three weeks after the}} fight between the ironclads that the great army under General McClellan arrived off Fortress Monroe, the greater portion of the troops coming down the Potomac in steam transports. Vast {{quantities}} of stores had been accumulated in and around the fortress. Guns of a size never before used in war were lying on the wharfs in readiness to be placed in batteries, while Hampton Roads were crowded with transports and <b>store</b> <b>vessels</b> watched over by the Monitor and the other warships. McClellan's army was a large one, but not so strong a force as he had intended to have taken with him, {{and as soon as he}} arrived at Fortress Monroe he learned that he would not be able to expect much assistance from the fleet. The Merrimac completely closed the James River; and were the more powerful vessels of the fleet to move up York River, she would be able to sally out and destroy the rest of the fleet and the transports.|$|R
50|$|Lakes Marina {{provides}} {{dry stack}} storage. The dry stack storage building is solid concrete and fitted out with fire fighting and superior lighting equipment. The dry berths are located with repair facilities, parking the marina office. Dry berths {{are available for}} boats up to 30 feet in length and the crane can lift boats up to 4.5 tons. Current facilities {{make it possible to}} <b>store</b> 270 <b>vessels</b> in the dry-stack storage building.|$|R
5000|$|An ambry (or almery, aumbry; {{from the}} medieval form almarium, cf. Lat. armƒÅrium, [...] "a place for keeping tools"; cf. O. Fr. aumoire and mod. armoire) is a {{recessed}} cabinet {{in the wall}} of a Christian church for <b>storing</b> sacred <b>vessels</b> and vestments. They are sometimes near the piscina, but more often on the opposite side. The word also seems in medieval times to be used commonly for any closed cupboard and even bookcase.|$|R
60|$|The king {{gave all}} the live cattle to the Nurembergers, who, {{though they had}} really no want of provisions, yet fresh meat was not so {{plentiful}} as such provisions which were <b>stored</b> up in <b>vessels</b> and laid by.|$|R
50|$|Materials {{are also}} {{manufactured}} on-site, such as cement, refined petroleum, food products, bricks and tiles, furniture and chemicals.

This issue tells vessel owners the importance of communicating with marina management, responding properly to fuel spills, and using best management practices in waste disposal.

50|$|Note {{that where}} the pressure-volume product {{is part of}} a safety standard, any {{incompressible}} liquid in the vessel can be excluded as it does not contribute to the potential energy <b>stored</b> in the <b>vessel,</b> so only the volume of the compressible part such as gas is used.|$|R
50|$|HMAS Southern Cross was an {{examination}} <b>vessel,</b> <b>stores</b> and troop carrier of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) during the Second World War. Built in 1933 for the Melanesian Mission of the Anglican Church, she was requisitioned by the RAN on 29 March 1941 and commissioned on 18 June 1941.|$|R
50|$|In a {{refinery}} or gas plant, LPG must be <b>stored</b> {{in pressure}} <b>vessels.</b> These containers are either cylindrical and horizontal or spherical.

25|$|In {{the fourteenth}} century, Edward II seized the {{properties}} of the Knights Templar, who had been founded to protect pilgrims to Jerusalem. An effigy of a Knight Templar was sent from Temple Sowerby to Milburn and placed against the south wall, where it still stands. The west windows were re-set. The two arches were rebuilt to stand as now on the south side. An aumbry (a recess to <b>store</b> sacred <b>vessels</b> near the altar) with a pointed arch, in the south wall of the chancel belongs to this period.|$|R
50|$|After the war, the peace-time {{population}} decreased {{to about}} 25,000. At this time, the Navy Department announced it selected Orange {{as one of}} eight locations where it would <b>store</b> reserve <b>vessels.</b> The area of the shipyards provided a favorable location, as the Sabine River furnished an abundant supply of fresh water to prevent saltwater corrosion. Also during this period the local chemical plants expanded which boosted the economy. The chemical industry continues today as a leading source of revenue to the area. The U.S. Naval Station was changed to a Reserve base in December 1975, and decommissioned completely in September, 2008.|$|R
50|$|After 1613, Vologda quickly {{recovered}} {{due to its}} convenient {{location and}} once again became an important center of foreign trade. During the reign of Peter the Great, Vologda {{became one of the}} main military bases of Russia. Military and technical equipment for fortresses and military ships under construction was <b>stored</b> there. <b>Vessels</b> which delivered food supplies to Arkhangelsk were constructed in Vologda. Peter intended to hold them on Lake Kubenskoye, 30 km north of Vologda. However, after personally inspecting the lake in 1692, he abandoned the idea deciding that the lake is improper for that purpose.|$|R
5000|$|Homebrewers {{often use}} kegs for aging, filtering, and storing beer. These are seldom the {{standard}} kegs used by major brewers to transport draught beer to wholesalers, but instead are reconditioned Cornelius kegs (colloquially known as [...] "cornies") that were originally manufactured to <b>store</b> soda; these <b>vessels</b> are {{much easier to}} fill, clean and maintain than standard beer kegs.|$|R
50|$|The church {{consists}} of a nave and chancel with high gables, {{and the remains of}} a bell-gable in the west. The arch leading into the chancel is of particular interest: Carved stones {{on each side of the}} arch show three dogs attacking an otter or fox, and another carving of three men, possibly depicting the Arrest of Jesus. There is a single lancet window and an ambry (recess for <b>storing</b> sacred <b>vessels</b> and vestments) at ground level on the north wall and a surviving lancet and piscina at the east end of the south wall. There is a small bullaun stone in the nave.|$|R
5000|$|An {{article in}} the Albion Weekly News {{reported}} that two witnesses saw an airship crash just inches from where they were standing. The airship suddenly disappeared, with a man standing where the vessel had been. The airship pilot showed the men a small device that supposedly enabled him to shrink the airship small enough to <b>store</b> the <b>vessel</b> in his pocket. A rival newspaper, the Wilsonville Review, playfully claimed that its own editor was an additional witness to the incident and that he heard the pilot say [...] "Weiver eht rof ebircsbus!"
