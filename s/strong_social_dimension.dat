5000|$|The Spanish had {{established}} precedents for regimes of forced labor {{prior to their}} encounter with New World peoples. Over centuries in Iberia, Muslims had enslaved Christians, and with the Christian reconquest, the victors enslaved the Moors. Slavery was an institution that was economic in function, but it had <b>strong</b> <b>social</b> <b>dimensions</b> as well. Enslaved persons were outsiders of some kind, by ethnicity, language, or religion or some combination. In Iberia, slaves were considered human and possessed some rights, but were {{at the bottom of}} the status hierarchy. There were some Muslim slaves remaining in Christian Spain after 1492, but increasingly enslaved Africans via the Portuguese slave trade became part of Spain's social mosaic. Black slaves in Spain were overwhelmingly domestic servants, and increasingly became prestigious property for elite Spanish households.

New tools, processes, roles and responsibilities were developed during the attempt. We examine the behavioural and organizational integration aspects of evaluation during that journey...|$|R
40|$|The EU faces {{a number}} of major challenges: to shift its support from the {{industries}} of the past to the knowledge-based industries of the future; to rescue the Lisbon strategy, designed to build a knowledge-based economy but so far achieving little; to re-engage with the European public after the difficulties with the Constitution. The paper argues that these challenges are intimately connected and that it is only by addressing them together that there is any hope for success. It elaborates these connections with particular reference to a reinvigorated Lisbon strategy with a <b>strong</b> <b>social</b> <b>dimension.</b> It concludes by delineating the corresponding challenge that faces the research community: to undertake a fundamental revision of its analysis of social policy in relation to modern economies; and to build a new toolkit for intelligent benchmarking...|$|E

40|$|In this essay, Walter Gantz {{reflects}} {{on the importance of}} communication and sport and the evolution of his research on fanship and social relationships. Cutting across two overlapping dimensions—physical location and technology—this essay char-acterizes key ways that sports fanship may be integrally linked with meaningful relationships. Sports viewing at home is often a shared activity, one that is far more likely to maintain or enhance existing relationships than isolate or annoy family members and create significant strife. Sports viewing during holidays can create special frustrations but these, too, seem easily addressed by family members. Out-of-home attention to mediated sports—from sports bars to the workplace— also has a <b>strong</b> <b>social</b> <b>dimension</b> as participants are able to share and affirm their fanship, at times at a cost to productivity. Social media and other interactive technol-ogies (e. g., talk radio, smart phones, the Internet) facilitate sports-related expression and community. Research still needs to be conducted on the social dimension of sports fanship across the span of adult life.

40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the act of the British Labour Party when they {{recalled}} a referendum promised by former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Tony Blair promised {{a referendum on the}} Constitutional Treaty, but his successor Gordon Brown later recalled it when the Lisbon Treaty succeeded the Constitutional Treaty as the legal foundation of the European Union. The main purpose of this thesis was to with help from various theorethical frameworks explain why the Labour Party decided to do this, even if this decision gave the main opposition party, the Conservative and Unionist Party (the Tories), the chance to heavily critisize the Labour Party, and picture them as traitors. The research questions were: • What are the reasons that the Labour Party went from being a Eurosceptical party, to become more pro-European? • Why did the Labour Party cancel the promised referendum on the new treaty of the European Union? Various answers were found for the first research question. Among the most important was that it {{was a part of the}} over all transition which led to the launch of New Labour. The second research question was answered with three explanatory models based on actions of the Labour Party on three arenas; the electoral arena (based on power, this model claims that the Labour Party act as they do because the know the Tories would not act differently if they were in office), the parliamentary arena (based on ideology, this model claims that Labour want the Lisbon Treaty because it has a <b>stronger</b> <b>social</b> <b>dimension</b> than earlier treaties) and the internal arena (based on the problem of identification, this model claims that the Labour Party identifies itself with the British government, and not just the voters, and are afraid of damaging Britain’s influence in the EU and international politics if Britain says ‘no’ to the Lisbon Treaty) ...|$|R

40|$|For {{the broad}} {{problematic}} of European public broadcasting service (PBS), we chose a rather narrow view point of its financing. The competition law in EU, {{which is called}} by many an economic constitution for its force and prime role {{in the process of}} European integration, has much larger impacts than solely economic ones. The respect of competition rules in PBS financing can also indicate a good level of political end economical media independence. This thesis consists of three main parts. The first part treats PBS as a fraction of a far larger field of general economic interest services. Those services, essential in European social model, are represented on EU level legislation mainly as exceptions of strict competition rules. Regarding this topic, we follow the development in practice of the European court of justice. We follow the struggle between two conceptions - the "compensatory" and the "state aid" conception which ended in compromise Altmark judgment of the European court of justice in 2003. The problems of services of general economic interest and its place in European national societies represent a <b>strong</b> <b>social</b> <b>dimension,</b> to which PBS add also the cultural and national one.

40|$|The initial brief {{for this}} work was to explore {{narrative}} and how art direction in the studio can affect {{the outcome of the}} image. The actor, Tilda, was given a range of emotions to project towards the camera (though not directly at the lens) and an image was taken approximately every five seconds. What is not revealed, and ultimately has no bearing on the piece, is that the subject is an actor and the emotions being asked of her are contrived and stage-managed. Rather than reinforcing the intended narrative, the title and the sequence of images obfuscates our reading in an attempt to highlight the ambiguity inherent in any work of art. The presentation and the deliberate resistance to explanation draw heavily on the work of Ed Ruscha and Martha Rosler, who provide similar examples ambivalent and equivocal in their manifestation. Notably, Ruscha’s Every Building on Sunset Strip and Rosler’s The Bowery in Two Inadequate Descriptive Systems demonstrate how image and text can serve to deter assumptions and emotional responses. The flat, minimal and literal nature of their presentation delimits our explication of the subject matter. Rosler’s work attests to a <b>strong</b> <b>social</b> <b>dimension</b> that works to reinstate ethical intention through an ambivalence of form...|$|E

Second, assuming the techniques as object of assessment, they could help to disseminate innovative products and technologies. At the same time, they could deepen the knowledge of local techniques, which sometimes are more effective or sustainable, providing useful information to orient further research. ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that actors in a network {{demonstrate}} correlated behaviors. In this work, we aim to predict the outcome of collective behavior given a social network and the behavioral information of some actors. In particular, we explore scalable learning of collective behavior when millions of actors are involved in the network. Our approach follows a social-dimension based learning framework. <b>Social</b> <b>dimensions</b> are extracted to represent the potential affiliations of actors before discriminative learning occurs. As existing approaches to extract <b>social</b> <b>dimensions</b> suffer from scalability, it is imperative to address the scalability issue. We propose an edge-centric clustering scheme to extract <b>social</b> <b>dimensions</b> and a scalable k-means variant to handle edge clustering. Essentially, each edge is treated as one data instance, and the connected nodes are the corresponding features. Then, the proposed k-means clustering algorithm can be applied to partition the edges into disjoint sets, with each set representing one possible affiliation. With this edge-centric view, we show that the extracted <b>social</b> <b>dimensions</b> are guaranteed to be sparse. This model, based on the sparse <b>social</b> <b>dimensions,</b> shows comparable prediction performance with earlier <b>social</b> <b>dimension</b> approaches. An incomparable advantage of our model is that it easily scales to handle networks with millions of actors while the earlier models fail.
