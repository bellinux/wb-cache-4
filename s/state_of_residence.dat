Franken paid a $25,000 fine {{to the state of}} New York upon being advised his corporation was out of compliance with the state's workers' compensation laws. At the same time, the California Franchise Tax Board reported that the same corporation owed more than $4,743.40 in taxes, fines, and associated penalties in the state of California for 2003 through 2007, because the corporation did not file tax returns in the state for those years. A Franken representative said that it followed the advice of an accountant who believed when the corporation stopped doing business in California that no further filing was required. Subsequently, Franken paid $70,000 in back income taxes in 17 states dating back to 2003, mostly from his speeches and other paid appearances. Franken said he paid the income tax in his <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence,</b> and he would seek retroactive credit for paying the taxes in the wrong states.|$|E

25|$|Women's clubs helped work towards {{marriage}} reforms {{which would}} benefit women. An act passed on March 2, 1907, {{made it the}} law that when a woman married, she took on the citizenship of her husband. Women needed to have citizenship independent of their husbands. It was important to establish citizenship {{for the right to}} vote. Marriage laws in 1921 still had separate standards for married women's citizenship status depending on her <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence.</b> Finally, in 1922, the United States Congress passed the Married Women's Act, granting married women their own nationality in the United States. In 1936, Congress created a provision for women who had lost their citizenship due to marriage, and were no longer married, to re-swear allegiance to the United States.|$|E
25|$|Despite its {{regressive}} tax formula, Social Security benefits are calculated using a progressive benefit formula that replaces {{a much higher}} percentage of low-income workers' pre-retirement income than that of higher-income workers (although these low-income workers pay {{a higher percentage of}} their pre-retirement income). Supporters of the current system also point to numerous studies that show that, relative to high-income workers, Social Security disability and survivor benefits paid on behalf of low-income workers more than offset any retirement benefits that may be lost because of shorter life expectancy (this offset would only apply at a population level). Other research asserts that survivor benefits, allegedly an offset, actually exacerbate the problem because survivor benefits are denied to single individuals, including widow(er)s married fewer than nine months (except in certain situations), divorced widow(er)s married fewer than 10 years, and co-habiting or same-sex couples, unless they are legally married in their <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence.</b> Unmarried individuals and minorities tend to be less wealthy.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{there are}} {{separate}} rules applied to most banks. The U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously in the 1978 Marquette Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corp. {{case that the}} National Banking Act of 1863 allowed nationally chartered banks to charge the legal rate of interest in their state regardless of the borrower's <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence.</b> In 1980, Congress passed the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act. [...] Among the Act's provisions, it exempted federally chartered savings banks, installment plan sellers and chartered loan companies from state usury limits. Combined with the Marquette decision that applied to National Banks, this effectively overrode all state and local usury laws. The 1968 Truth in Lending Act does not regulate rates, except for some mortgages, but requires uniform or standardized disclosure of costs and charges.|$|E
2500|$|With {{respect to}} implementation, the {{principal}} dispute concerned the 1913 statute that denied a marriage license {{to a couple}} if their marriage would not be valid in their <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence.</b> The Massachusetts Town Clerks' Association raised the issue {{for the first time}} on February 24, reporting that some of them were receiving inquiries from out-of-state couples. New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer made the question more urgent when he issued a non-binding opinion on March 3 that [...] "New York common law requires recognizing as valid a marriage ... validly executed in another state". On March 31, Romney took the position that no other states recognized same-sex marriage and therefore residents of other states could not marry in Massachusetts.

The prosecutor argued, however, that because the defendant's wife had been kidnapped in Alabama, the murder [...] "may be punished" [...] there. [...] On January 12, 1983, a jury in the Alabama court convicted Heath of [...] "murder during a kidnapping in the first degree," [...] a capital offense, He was sentenced to death, and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed this decision on direct appeal.

2500|$|Named after Frits Bolkestein, the Directive on {{services}} in the internal market aims at enabling a company from a given member-state to recruit workers in other European Union countries using the law of its home country. It triggered huge protests in Europe. This directive was voted in the European Parliament in March 2006 and the MEPs proposed amendments to the provisional text. The [...] "principle of origin", which stipulates that workers are employed under the legal arrangements of their own <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence,</b> {{was replaced by a}} new [...] "freedom" [...] principle â€“ freedom to provide services, meaning that administrative obstacles should be removed. The compromise allowed the draft Directive to continue to exist. However, {{there was a great deal}} of concern about its effect on social standards and welfare, triggering competition between various parts of Europe. This led to significant protests across Europe against the directive including a notable protest at the European Parliament in Strasbourg by port workers which led to damage to the building. MEPs eventually reached a compromise on the text and the Parliament adopted it on 12 December 2006; 2 years after Bolkestein left office, under the Barroso Commission.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{falconry}} {{is legal}} in all states except Hawaii. [...] It is also illegal in the District of Columbia. A falconer {{must have a}} state permit to practice the sport (requirements for a federal permit were changed in 2008 and the program discontinued effective January 1, 2014). [...] Acquiring a falconry license in the United States requires an aspiring falconer to pass a written test, have equipment and facilities inspected, and serve {{a minimum of two}} years as an apprentice under a licensed falconer, during which time, the falconer may only possess one raptor. There are three classes of the falconry license, which is a permit issued jointly by the falconer's <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> and the federal government. The aforementioned Apprentice license matriculates to a General Class license, which allows the falconer to up to three raptors at one time (some jurisdictions may further limit this). After a minimum of five years at General level, falconers may apply for a Master Class license, which allows them to keep up to five wild raptors for falconry and an unlimited number of captively-produced raptors (all must be used for falconry). Certain highly experienced master falconers may also apply to possess golden eagles for falconry.|$|E

40|$|U. S. Presidential {{elections}} polarize U. S. Courts of Appeals judges, doubling their dissents, partisan voting, and lawmaking along partisan {{lines and}} increasing their reversal of District Court decisions (Berdejo and Chen 2016). Dissents are elevated for ten {{months before the}} Presidential elections. I develop a theoretical model showing that the salience of partisan identities drives these behavioral patterns. The polarizing effects are larger in close elections, non-existent in landslide elections, and reversed in wartime elections. I link judges to their <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> and exploit variation in the timing and importance <b>of</b> a <b>state</b> during the electoral season. Dissents are elevated in swing states and in states that count heavily to winning the election, when these states are competitive. U. S. Senate elections, the timing of which also varies by state, further elevate dissents. I link administrative data on case progression and frequency of campaign advertisements in judgesâ€™ <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> to proxy for a stateâ€™s importance during Presidential primaries. Dissents occur shortly before publication, increase with monthly increases in campaign ads, and appear for cases whose legal topic, economic activity, is most heavily covered by campaign ads. Finally, I link the cases to their potential resolution in the Supreme Court. Dissents before elections appear on more marginal cases that cite discretionary miscellaneous issues and procedural (rather than substantive) arguments, which the Supreme Court appears to recognize and only partly remedy. The behavioral changes of unelected Courts of Appeals judges are larger than the behavioral changes of elected judges running for re-election...|$|R
