5|$|Pesticides {{are applied}} to crops by {{agricultural}} aircraft, tractor-mounted crop <b>sprayers</b> or as seed dressings to control pests. However, successful control by pesticides is not easy; the right formulation must be chosen, the timing is often critical, the method of application is important, adequate coverage and retention on the crop are necessary. The killing of natural enemies of the target pest should be minimised. This is particularly important in countries where there are natural reservoirs of pests and their enemies in the countryside surrounding plantation crops, and these co-exist in a delicate balance. Often in less-developed countries, the crops are well adapted to the local situation and no pesticides are needed. Where progressive farmers are using fertilisers to grow improved crop varieties, these are often more susceptible to pest damage, but the indiscriminate application of pesticides may be detrimental in the longer term.|$|E

40|$|Seven orchard spray {{application}} techniques were compared {{in terms of}} within-tree deposition quality and off-target losses {{to the ground and}} behind the target trees. The studied spray techniques included different <b>sprayer</b> types, fan speeds and air deflector settings. An artificial pear canopy was realized for this purpose. Filter papers and a multiple tracer methodology were used to evaluate deposition. All measurements were conducted indoor and will be used as an input and to validate a CFD orchard spray model. Results showed that spray application technique has an effect on spray deposition. <b>Sprayer</b> design caused major differences in spray distribution and off-target losses. A <b>sprayer</b> with individual spouts gave the highest deposits on the tree (0. 15 L), followed by an axial <b>sprayer</b> (0. 10 e 0. 12 L). Changing settings on the axial <b>sprayer</b> only caused minor differences, although the high fan gear performed significantly better than the low gear.

40|$|Weed {{control is}} {{typically}} achieved by broadcast spraying postemergence herbicides {{on the entire}} orchard floor which wastes chemical by spraying bare ground. Growers can account for spatial variation in weed density and only spray weedy areas instead of applying herbicide to entire fields by using the automatic spot-sprayer, WeedSeeker <b>sprayer.</b> We conducted field experiments in flood- and microsprinikler-irrigated lemon orchards, and flood- and sprinkler-irrigated pecan orchards to measure the amount of herbicide applied, weed control, tree yield, and the economic value of adopting the WeedSeeker <b>sprayer</b> compared to conventional boom spray technology. The WeedSeeker <b>sprayer</b> reduced cumulative herbicide use by at least 36 % compared to the conventional boom <b>sprayer</b> at all sites. Weed control obtained using the WeedSeeker <b>sprayer</b> was usually similar to the conventional boom <b>sprayer.</b> There were no effects of the treatments on yield at any location. The partial budget analysis, {{used to determine the}} economic value of adopting the technology, showed that as the area of the orchard and the cost of the herbicide increased, the time to recover the initial investment in the WeedSeeker <b>sprayer</b> decreased. The investment in the technology can typically be recovered in less than five years in Arizona lemon and pecan orchards. We also conducted greenhouse experiments to determine the effect of various sensitivity settings and leaf area on the operational efficiency of the WeedSeeker <b>sprayer.</b> The WeedSeeker <b>sprayer</b> did not detect and spray all broadleaf and monocot plants unless a sensitive setting was used. The WeedSeeker <b>sprayer</b> was more efficient when detecting broadleaf plants compared to monocot plants. Our results indicate that operating the WeedSeeker <b>sprayer</b> using a sensitive setting (sensitivity level 2) will result in the most efficient detection of weeds. Finally, field studies were conducted in a non-bearing pecan orchard to evaluate weed management systems using various postemergence and preemergence herbicides. Most postemergence herbicides controlled the weed species present in the orchard. Tank mixing the herbicides generally resulted in greater control compared to applying them alone. All preemergence herbicides reduced the weed emergence compared to not using a preemergence herbicide. No pecan tree damage was observed in any treatment...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sprayer</b> is a {{pesticide}} applicator tool {{which is}} used to control pests and plant diseases. The main problem of the hand <b>sprayer</b> is {{that it has to be}} picked up, so that the farmers should deal with the weight.

Based on these problems, the idea to innovate the hand <b>sprayer</b> arises, by modifying it to be semi-automatic <b>sprayer,</b> which is carry-free and energy saving. The principle work is the use of force resulted by wheel rotational motion, converted into translational motion to drive the pump rod as the air compressor.
