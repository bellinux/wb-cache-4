50|$|Due {{to their}} {{ecological}} similarities, the crowned eagle is Africa's best analogue of the harpy eagle (<b>Harpia</b> <b>harpyja).</b> Thanks to its bold and highly conspicuous behavior, it is exceptionally well-studied for a large, forest-dwelling eagle. Due {{to a relatively}} high level of habitat adaptability, it was until recently considered to be faring well {{by the standards of}} large, forest-dependent raptors. However, today it is generally thought that it is decreasing far more than was previously perceived due to the almost epidemic destruction of native tropical African forest. It is now listed by the IUCN as Near Threatened.|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} {{fragmentation}} intensify {{the effects of}} genetic drift and endogamy, reducing genetic variability of populations with serious consequences for wildlife conservation. The Harpy Eagle (<b>Harpia</b> <b>harpyja)</b> is a forest dwelling species that is considered near threatened and suffers from habitat loss in the forests of the Neotropical region. In this study, 72 historical and current samples were assessed using eight autosomal microsatellite markers to investigate the distribution of genetic diversity of the Harpy Eagle of the Amazonian and Atlantic forests in Brazil.

A lower mandible from the Haast's eagle measured 11.4 cm and the tarsus in several Haast's fossils has been measured from 22.7 to 24.9 cm. In comparison, the largest beaks of eagles today (from the Philippine and the Steller's sea eagle) reach a little more than 7 cm; and the longest tarsal measurements (from the Philippine and the Papuan eagle) top out around 14 cm.|$|R
40|$|Prior {{to human}} {{settlement}} 700 years ago New Zealand had no terrestrial mammals - apart from three species of bats -instead, approximately 250 avian species dominated the ecosystem. At {{the top of}} the food chain was the extinct Haast's eagle, Harpagornis moorei. H. moorei (10 - 15 kg; 2 - 3 m wingspan) was 30 %- 40 % heavier than the largest extant eagle (the harpy eagle, <b>Harpia</b> <b>harpyja),</b> and hunted moa up to 15 times its weight. In a dramatic example of morphological plasticity and rapid size increase, we show that the H. moorei was very closely related to one of the world's smallest extant eagles, which is one-tenth its mass.

A number of species including: Myrmecophaga tridactyla, Panthera onca, <b>Harpia</b> <b>harpyja</b> and Ara ambigua will probably go extinct in Costa Rica within the next century due to lack of sufficiently large dense forest habitat areas for survival. The importance of protecting large areas of dense forest habitat for conserving genetically “viable ” wildlife populations is emphasized and key areas are identified for each species.

40|$|Abstract The {{predation}} pressure put on primates by diurnal {{birds of}} prey differs greatly between continents. Africa and South America have specialist raptors (e. g. crowned hawk-eagle Stephanoaetus coronatus and harpy eagle <b>Harpia</b> <b>harpyja)</b> whereas in Asia the only such spe-cialist’s (Philippine eagle Pithecophaga jefferyi) distribu-tion is largely allopatric with primates. The almost universal absence of polyspecific groups in Asia (common in Africa and South America) may indicate reduced predation pres-sure. As such there is almost no information on predation pressures on primates in Asia by raptors. Here we report successful predation of a juvenile banded langur Presbytis femoralis (* 2 kg) by a changeable hawk-eagle Spizaetus cirrhatus. The troop that was attacked displayed no signs of being alarmed, and no calls were made before the event. We argue that in insular Southeast Asia, especially, large Spizaetus hawk-eagles (* 2 kg) are significant predators of arboreal colobines. Using data on the relative size of sym-patric Spizaetus hawk-eagles and colobines we make pre-dictions on where geographically we can expect the highest predation pressure (Thai–Malay Peninsula) and which col-obines are least (Nasalis larvatus, Trachypithecus auratus, P. thomasi) and most (P. femoralis, T. cristatus) affected...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{characterization}} and optimization of 45 heterologous microsatellite loci, {{and the development}} of a new set of molecular sex markers for the conservation and management of the Neotropical harpy eagle (<b>Harpia</b> <b>harpyja</b> L. 1758). Of the 45 microsatellites tested, 24 were polymorphic, six monomorphic, 10 uncharacterizable due to multiple bands and five did not amplify. The observed gene diversity of the analyzed sample of H. harpyja was low and similar to that of other threatened Falconiformes. While a high proportion of the microsatellite markers were highly variable, individuals of H. harpyja could be differentiated by a joint analysis of just three (p = 2. 79 x 10 - 4) or four markers (p = 2. 89 x 10 - 5). Paternity could be rejected with 95. 23 % and 97. 83 % probabilities using the same three and four markers, respectively. The sex determination markers easily and consistently differentiated males from females even with highly degraded DNA extracted from naturally shed feathers. The markers reported in this study potentially provide an excellent set of molecular tools for the conservation and management of wild and captive H. harpyja and they may also prove useful for the enigmatic Neotropical crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis Daudin 1800) ...|$|R
40|$|Decreasing of {{harpy eagle}} (<b>Harpia</b> <b>harpyja)</b> {{population}}s in natural environments, mainly in non-preserved areas, makes captive population management {{an important contribution}} to genetic diversity conservation. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate hematological parameters for captive harpy eagles maintained at the wild animals breeding center of Itaipu Binacional, Paraná State, Brazil. Fourteen blood samples from nine harpy eagles were collected from animals of both sexes, of different ages and with no clinical signs of disease. Significant variations were found in haematological values of hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), leukocyte, a relative number of heterophils, absolute and relative number of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils and plasma protein between groups of young (less than six months old) and adult birds. Comparing males and females there was variation in the values of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) on heterophils, absolute and relative number of lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils. There was also variation in the values of red blood cells, hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), leukocyte count, absolute number of lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils among birds that study compared to another reference birds.
