6000|$|... "Our {{friend at}} lunch! Yes, extraordinary. See here"; <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> pencil {{and drew the}} quick outline of a face in her note-book.

60|$|This {{she spoke}} with more alacrity than usually {{attended}} her expressions, and accompanied her words with an attitude of the hand, as if throwing something from her. She then raised up her form, once tall, and still retaining the appearance of having been so, though bent with age and rheumatism, and stood before the beggar like a mummy animated by some wandering spirit into a temporary resurrection. Her light-blue eyes wandered to and fro, as if she occasionally forgot and again remembered the purpose for which her long and withered hand was searching among the miscellaneous contents of an ample old-fashioned pocket. At length <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> small chip-box, and opening it, took out a handsome ring, in which was set a braid of hair, composed of two different colours, black and light brown, twined together, encircled with brilliants of considerable value.|$|E

This version wears a slightly modified version of her original outfit, with her trademark fishnets replaced by purple tights.|$|R

She instructed the people to go and reside around {{the spot where the}} bracelet fell instead. Thus, this new place became known as Kadagam. This later {{came to be known as}} Kadayam.|$|E

5000|$|Peg - The main character, {{together}} with her talking cat, Cat. She is a young girl who wears a red hat and blue dress.

5000|$|In the Battle Angel Alita series, {{the suicide}} booth {{is located in}} Tiphares and is called 'EndJoy'. The Endjoy was a public suicide booth located in the Dome Park of Tiphares. As the Endjoy was entered it played {{soothing}} music and a message stating [...] "Welcome to Endjoy, now just relax and step into the inner hatch". After Alita destroyed it, <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> giant grinder from down below the structure. According to Dr. Russell it is every Tipharian's right to end their own life if they wish. Using the Endjoy is considered a privilege and the invention of a superior race. Presumably constructed by the Medical Inspection Bureau (M.I.B.), Alita noticed people going into it, but not coming out after she was resurrected on Tiphares by Desty Nova. She entered the Endjoy to investigate and tore it to shreds, ripping out the grinder and exposing a current of water {{that she used to}} wash herself of the dead Tiphareans' blood. Russell was shocked at Alita's actions, but was forced to reveal what had happened to Lou Collins. Despite Alita's actions, she was not targeted by the M.I.B.|$|E
30|$|Vivian Hailstone was {{my great}} aunt. Growing up I {{remember}} her house being filled with baskets and {{the smells of}} gathered roots, ferns, and pine nuts. She {{was one of the}} first people to show me what beargrass looked like before it was dried. <b>She</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> long green piece and explained that when you choose what materials to gather you must do it with a purpose. Learning from many generations in my own family and community has helped me to conceptualize this article as a case study assessment of how bio-cultural sovereignty has and has not been supported by current research and policy practices and how it can and should be supported and utilized through continued research and policy development. This article explores the continued bio-cultural sovereignty of California Indian peoples as demonstrated through traditional gathering practices to argue that policies, procedures, methodologies, or academic research involving or affecting tribes should be designed in a way that acknowledges indigenous bio-cultural sovereignty through concrete policy language and agreements. These agreements can, in turn, be utilized to support the continued revitalization of ecological processes based in Indigenous epistemologies.|$|E
40|$|Jill Smith, age 52, has {{not seen}} her doctor for almost two years. She {{presents}} {{with a list of}} complaints and concerns that includes intermittent headaches {{at the back of her}} head and across her brow, interrupted night sleep, new intolerance to certain foods, and a tendency to lose her temper more often with people. She is worried that there is something very serious going on in her body. She has also read a newspaper report of a study showing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is dangerous for women. Since she has been on HRT for two years to control serious menopausal flushing, she wonders if she should stop the medication. Review of her systems and her physical exam were otherwise unremarkable. She was on no other medications. As an afterthought, following the exam, <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> copy of blood test results done two weeks ago at a walk-in clinic she went to because of growing anxiety about her health. Other than a small elevation in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the tests were normal, including a complete blood cell count, glucose, liver and renal function, and thyroid-stimulating hormone tests. Further enquiry of Mrs. Smith indicated there were a number of concurrent stressors in her life. Her 57 year-old husband had recently undergone investigations for coronary artery disease. The stock market drop meant she was likely to be laid off from her part-time job. Unfortunately, this income had bee...|$|E

The intruder {{turns out to}} be Camacho who had come in to settle scores with Jack. When Jack comes in, sees the situation and questions Nancy, he correctly deduces that she intended to murder him simply because she thought it would be fun. Nancy decides to pretend to the police that Camacho intended to harm her and hence she shot him in self-defence. To strengthen her version of events, she goes on a destructive spree through the house.|$|R
