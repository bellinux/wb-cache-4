This stock was last assessed over its range via VPA at SAW 16 in 1993 (Mayo and Figuerido 1993, NEFSC 1993 a, 1993 b). At that time, spawning stock biomass had been declining since the mid- 1980 s, and was expected to reach its long-term average (144, 000 mt). Fishing mortality {{was estimated to be}} 0. 72 in 1992, above F 20 % (0. 65) and well above Fmed (0. 47). The stock was then considered to be fully exploited and at a medium biomass level. The state of this stock was first evaluated via index assessment in 2000 (Mayo 2001). At that time, it was noted that biomass indices for the Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank portion of the stock, derived from NEFSC autumn bottom trawl surveys, had increased during the mid- 1970 s, declined sharply during the 1980 s, but have been generally increasing since the mid- 1990 <b>s.</b> <b>Indices</b> derived from Canadian bottom trawl surveys, conducted on the Scotian Shelf, increased during the 1980 s, but declined sharply during the early 1990 <b>s.</b> The <b>index</b> assessment <b>provided</b> no basis with which to evaluate the state of the stock relative to the control rule as determined b...|$|R
40|$|In {{difficult}} classification {{problems of}} the z-dimensional points into two groups giving 0 - 1 responses due to the messy data structure, we {{try to find the}} denser regions for the favorable customers of response 1, instead of finding the boundaries to separate the two groups. Such regions are called the bumps, and finding the boundaries of the bumps is called the bump hunting. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} find the largest region of the bumps under a specified ratio of the number of the points of response 1 to the total. Then, we may obtain a trade-off curve between the number of points of response 1 and the specified ratio. The decision tree method with the Gini 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>index</b> will <b>provide</b> the simple-shaped boundaries for the bumps if the marginal density for response 1 shows a rather simple or monotonic shape. Since the computing time searching for the optimal trees will cost much because of the NP-hardness of the problem, some random search methods, e. g., the genetic algorithm adapted to the tree, are useful. Due to the existence of many local maxima unlike the ordinary genetic algorithm search results, the extreme-value statistics will be useful to estimate the global optimum number of captured points; this also guarantees the accuracy of the semi-optimal solution with the simple descriptive rules. This combined method of genetic algorithm search and extreme-value statistics use is new. We apply this method to some artificial messy data case which mimics the real customer database, showing a successful result. The reliability of the solution is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The soil {{physical}} quality (SPQ) <b>index</b> <b>S</b> can <b>provide</b> inconsistent designations of SPQ {{and has a}} lack {{of consistency}} with other physical indicators for some soils. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the suitability of S in identifying SPQ against 12 SPQ indicators, including water-release-related indicators, physical properties, and visual examinations. This study was conducted on medium-textured soil samples taken from tropical and temperate soils. Comparisons of SPQ class and relationships between indicators were used to judge the S SPQ designation. For the studied soils, S classified SPQ in the same way as other indicators when the condition of the soil was optimal or degraded but not when it was intermediate. This demonstrates that the proposed critical limits for S are not generally valid and do not apply for all soil conditions. Porosity parameters from the water release curve were more consistent indicators of SPQ than S. Our work also demonstrates that scores from visual examinations have at least similar resolution (P > 0. 05) to the other indicators of SPQ evaluated. The use of S as an indicator to be considered as part of a minimum data set of indicators of SPQ assessment is less viable when other indicators such as bulk density, porosity, and visual examination are much more easily determined and more consistent than S. Therefore, it is too ambitious to consider that a unique indicator such as the <b>S</b> <b>index</b> could be used to evaluate SPQ as such...|$|R

Numerous {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to assess the differences in soil properties caused by different management systems in olive cropped farms. Nevertheless {{the influence of the}} most frequent management systems on the hydraulic properties of these soils has not been evaluated. Contrarily, there are very few studies that have tried to correlate these results with soil losses due to water erosion. There are complementary approaches to traditional degradation <b>indices,</b> as the <b>S</b> <b>index</b> based on the form of the soil retention curve (Dexter 2004 a,b,c). The objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the methods based on the <b>S</b> <b>index</b> to assess the physical quality of soil in olive orchards, (ii) to assess the short-term changes (2 years) in soil physical and chemical properties in two olive orchards under different managements systems, namely conventional tillage and cover crop, and (iii) to formulate strategies for assessing the quality of soil in olive orchards. For the studied soils, degradation processes (associated to conventional tillage) and the improvement of their properties (linked to cover crops) showed a fast response. Chemical changes were quickly observed. However physical changes are slower than chemical changes for both soils. Water retention curves allowed the evaluation of soil porosity based on depth in the profile and the management practices. The <b>S</b> <b>index</b> was computed for every soil using the conventional soil water retention equations fitted to the experimental data. For the olive cropped soils, higher <b>S</b> <b>index</b> values were obtained in the less degradated areas, in most of the cases.

In this paper, based on the S-theory, data from 16 collection sites in the Haihe River Basin in northern China were used, {{and the effects of}} soil particle size distribution and bulk density on three important indices of theS-theory were investigated on a regional scale. The relationships between unsaturated hydraulic conductivityKi at the inflection point and S values (S/hi) were also studied using two different types of fitting equations.

Methods A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 91 patients with pathologically confirmed CHB who visited General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University and underwent liver biopsy from January 2009 to April 2015. According to the Scheuer pathological stage and liver fibrosis stage (S), the patients were divided into non-liver fibrosis group (a liver fibrosis stage of S 0, 32 patients), mild liver fibrosis group (a liver fibrosis stage of ＜S 2, 30 patients), and marked liver fibrosis group (a liver fibrosis stage of ≥S 2, 29 patients). The APRI, FIB- 4, Forns <b>index,</b> and <b>S</b> <b>index</b> were calculated, and liver stiffness was measured by FibroScan. An analysis of variance was used for the comparison of normally distributed continuous data between three groups, and the Dunnett t-test was used for further comparison between any two groups. The Spearman correlation analysis was also performed. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the value of these noninvasive techniques in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis. Results There were significant differences in age, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and platelet count between the three groups (F= 3. 552, 4. 035, 4. 374, and 5. 992, all P＜ 0. 05), and there were significant differences in these parameters between the non-liver fibrosis group and the mild and marked liver fibrosis groups (P＜ 0. 05). There were significant differences in APRI, FIB- 4, Forns <b>index,</b> <b>S</b> <b>index,</b> and FibroScan between the three groups (F= 4. 579, 5. 728, 10. 501, 14. 118, and 30. 039, all P＜ 0. 05); there were significant differences in these indices between the non-liver fibrosis group and the mild and marked liver fibrosis groups (P＜ 0. 05), and {{there was a significant difference}} in FibroScan between the mild liver fibrosis group and the marked liver fibrosis group (P＜ 0. 05). APRI, FIB- 4, Forns <b>index,</b> <b>S</b> <b>index,</b> and FibroScan were positively correlated with the pathological stage of liver fibrosis (r= 0. 499, 0. 498, 0. 402, 0. 395, and 0. 739, all P＜ 0. 05). APRI, FIB- 4, Forns <b>index,</b> <b>S</b> <b>index,</b> or FibroScan alone has certain value in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis, with an AUC (95 % CI) of 0. 786 (0. 679 - 0. 892), 0. 818 (0. 717 - 0. 918), 0. 770 (0. 661 - 0. 880), 0. 718 (0. 599 - 0. 837), or 0. 919 (0. 864 - 0. 974) (all P＜ 0. 01). When APRI, FIB- 4, Forns <b>index,</b> or <b>S</b> <b>index</b> was combined with FibroScan, the AUC (95 % CI) was increased to 0. 922 (0. 868 - 0. 976), 0. 931 (0. 881 - 0. 981), 0. 926 (0. 873 - 0. 979), and 0. 918 (0. 862 - 0. 974), respectively.
