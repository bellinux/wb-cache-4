This image shows that lenticular galaxies may retain {{a considerable amount}} of dust in their disk. There is little to no gas and thus they are considered deficient in interstellar matter.|$|E
50|$|NGC 5866 (one of two galaxies {{commonly}} called the <b>Spindle</b> <b>Galaxy)</b> is a lenticular galaxy in the Draco constellation. This galaxy appears to closely match both the object description (by Pierre Méchain) in the printed {{version of the}} Messier Catalog of 1781, and the object position given by Charles Messier in hand-written notes on his personal list of the Messier Catalogue.|$|E
50|$|NGC 5866 (also {{called the}} <b>Spindle</b> <b>Galaxy</b> or Messier 102) is a {{relatively}} bright lenticular or spiral galaxy in the constellation Draco. NGC 5866 was probably discovered by Pierre Méchain or Charles Messier in 1781, and independently found by William Herschel in 1788.Measured orbital velocities of its globular cluster systemimply that dark matter comprises only 34±45% of the mass within 5 effective radii;a notable paucity.|$|E
50|$|NGC 3115 (also {{called the}} <b>Spindle</b> <b>Galaxy</b> or Caldwell 53) {{is a field}} {{lenticular}} (S0) galaxy in the constellation Sextans. The galaxy was discovered by William Herschel on February 22, 1787. At about 32 million light-years away from us it is several times bigger than the Milky Way. It is a lenticular (S0) galaxy because it contains a disk and a central bulge of stars, but without a detectable spiral pattern. NGC 3115 is seen almost exactly edge-on, but was nevertheless mis-classified as elliptical. There is some speculation that NGC 3115, in its youth, was a quasar.|$|E
