30|$|Specific {{differentially}} expressed genes (DEG) {{analysis was}} conducted to evaluate the pollen sterility effect in autotetraploid rice hybrids. We detected significant GO terms in Group III, while no significant GO term was detected in other groups. Three GO terms, including response to endogenous stimulus (GO: 0009719), transcription regulator activity (GO: 0030528) and transcription factor activity (GO: 0003700), were significant GO terms in Group III (i.e. comparison between SaSbSc vs Sc). In addition, protein-protein interaction network was only detected in Group III, and 40 % of differentially expressed genes in this group were involved in <b>stronger</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interaction network. Co-expression analysis results also verified that co-expression networks were mainly present in Group III, and two primary co-expression networks, contained 11 and 10 genes, exhibited significant co-expression interaction in this group. These results clearly demonstrated that deleterious interactions in Group III (interactions of Sa and Sb pollen sterility loci) have more pronounced effects on the pollen sterility of polyploid rice compared to other groups.|$|R
40|$|Despite its {{protected}} {{position within}} the nucleus, DNA is subjected to a constant barrage of destabilizing forces, the result of which is an unending series of breaks in the double helix. Repairing the damage {{is the job of}} a suite of specialized proteins, which includes a newly dis-covered superfamily of single-strand annealing proteins (SSAPs). How SSAPs, such as human RAD 52 or Redβ from the bacterial phage lambda, function remains unclear, but early studies of RAD 52 and Redβ revealed that they could form ring-shaped multimers. Whether and how these ring complexes catalyze DNA repair was puzzling, especially since the high concentra-tions of protein required to produce the rings also seemed to inhibit, rather than promote, repair. Now, a new study on Redβ by Marcel Ander, Erik Schäffer, and colleagues shows that the ring appears to play no role in healing broken DNA; instead, repair is initiated by the protein in monomeric form. Surprisingly, the initial interaction between protein and DNA weakens, not strengthens, the link between the two DNA strands, and by the time its job is done, the forces holding Redβ units to one another are among the <b>strongest</b> <b>protein–protein</b> associations known...|$|R

A detailed analysis of the ultrastructure of the matrix protein array by electron microscopy and image processing of specimens prepared by negative staining or by freezedrying and shadowing shows that the molecules are arranged according to threefold symmetry on a hexagonal lattice whose repeat is 7. 7 nm.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 26 - 27). After in vivo and in vitro experiments comparing wild type and S 2 knockout strains of EIAV were conducted, the role of one small accessory protein still eluted discovery, S 2. S 2, is a small protein that has a nuclear localization sequence, SH 3 binding domain ligand, and is only 19 kD in size. It was used in a bacterial two-hybrid to discover interacting host cell partner proteins from a mouse lung cDNA library via transcriptional activation. The experiment used a genetically modified strain of E. coli to test interactions between fusion products made by fusing S 2 with lambda repressor, and random cellular proteins to RNA polymerase (RNAP). Since a reporter strain cassette is contained within the genetically altered bacteria, the lambda repressor can bind to the altered lambda operator, freeing the S 2 particle for interaction. If a single bacteria has the plasmid that codes for S 2 and the interacting partner, then the interacting partner can bind to S 2, guiding RNAP to transcribe the reporter gene, carbenicillin.

Rather than the traditional approach to studying individual genes or loci, a systematic investigation of cancer proteins in the human protein-protein interaction network may provide important biological information for uncovering the molecular mechanisms of cancer and, potentially, other complex diseases. Results We explored global and local network characteristics of the proteins encoded by cancer genes (cancer proteins) in the human interactome. We found that the network topology of the cancer proteins was much {{different from that of the}} proteins encoded by essential genes (essential proteins) or control genes (control proteins). Relative to the essential proteins or control proteins, cancer proteins tended to have higher degree, higher betweenness, shorter shortest-path distance, and weaker clustering coefficient in the human interactome. We further separated the cancer proteins into two groups (recessive and dominant cancer proteins) and compared their topological features. Recessive cancer proteins had higher betweenness than dominant cancer proteins, while their degree distribution and characteristic shortest path distance were also significantly different. Finally, we found that cancer proteins were not randomly distributed in the human interactome and they connected strongly with each other. Conclusion Our study revealed much <b>stronger</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interaction characteristics of cancer proteins relative to the essential proteins or control proteins in the whole human interactome. We also found stronger network characteristics of recessive than dominant cancer proteins. The results are helpful for cancer candidate gene prioritization and verification, biomarker discovery, and, ultimately, understanding the etiology of cancer at the systems biological level. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{potency of}} botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) is mediated by their high neurospecificity, targeting peripheral cholinergic motoneurons leading to flaccid paralysis and successive respiratory failure. Complex polysialo gangliosides accumulate BoNTs on the plasma membrane and facilitate subsequent binding to synaptic vesicle membrane proteins {{which results in}} toxin endocytosis. The luminal domain 4 (LD 4) of the three synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV 2) isoforms A-C mediates uptake of the clinically most relevant serotype BoNT/A. SV 2 C-LD 4 exhibits the <b>strongest</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interaction and comprises five putative N‑glycosylation sites. Here, we expressed human SV 2 C‑LD 4 fused to human IgG‑Fc in prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems to analyse the effect of N‑glycosylation of SV 2 C on the interaction with BoNT/A. Mass spectrometric analysis of gSV 2 CLD-Fc demonstrates glycosylation of N 534, N 559 and N 565, the latter two residing at the BoNT/A interface. Mutational analysis exhibits that only the N 559 ‑glycan, but not N 565 -glycan increases affinity of BoNT/A to human gSV 2 C‑LD 4. The N 559 ‑glycan was characterised as of complex core-fucosylated type with a heterogeneity ranging up to tetra-antennary structure with bisecting N‑acetylglucosamine which can establish extensive interactions with BoNT/A. The mutant gSV 2 CLD-Fc N 559 A displayed a 50 -fold increased dissociation rate k d resulting in an overall 12 -fold decreased binding affinity in surface plasmon resonance experiments. The delayed dissociation might provide BoNT/A more time for endocytosis into synaptic vesicles. In conclusion, we show {{the importance of the}} complex N 559 ‑glycan of SV 2 C-LD 4, adding a third anchor point beside a ganglioside and the SV 2 C-LD 4 peptide, for BoNT/A neuronal cell surface binding and uptake...|$|R
40|$|Topoisomerase 2 (Top 2) is an {{essential}} enzyme responsible for manipulating DNA topology during replication, transcription, chromosome organization and chromosome segregation. It acts by nicking both strands of DNA and then passes another DNA molecule through the break. The 5 ′ end of each nick is covalently linked to the tyrosine in the active center {{of each of the}} two subunits of Top 2 (Top 2 cc). In this configuration, {{the two sides of the}} nicked DNA are held together by the <b>strong</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interactions between the two subunits of Top 2, allowing the nicks to be faithfully resealed in situ. Top 2 ccs are normally transient, but can be trapped by cancer drugs, such as etoposide, and subsequently processed into DSBs in cells. If not properly repaired, these DSBs would lead to genome instability and cell death. Here, I review the current understanding of the mechanisms by which DSBs are induced by etoposide, the unique features of such DSBs and how they are repaired.

40|$|RIBONUCLEASE {{inhibitor}} is a {{cytoplasmic protein}} that tightly binds and inhibits ribonucleases of the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily 1. The primary sequence of this inhibitor contains leucine-rich repeats 2 (LRRs); these motifs {{are present in}} many proteins that participate in protein-protein interactions and have different functions and cellular locations. In vivo, ribonuclease inhibitor may {{have a role in}} the regulation of RNA turnover in mammalian cells 3 and in angiogenesis 4. To define the structural features of LRR proteins and to understand better the nature of the tight interaction of ribonuclease inhibitor with ribonucleases, we have determined the crystal structure of the porcine inhibitor. To our knowledge, this is the first three-dimensional structure of a protein containing LRRs and represents a new class of alpha/beta protein fold. Individual repeats constitute beta-alpha structural units that probably also occur in other proteins containing LRRs. The non-globular shape of the structure and the exposed face of the parallel beta-sheet may explain why LRRs are used to achieve <b>strong</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interactions.

A key question is how special are these functional properties of proteins. Are they extremely rare, or are they an intrinsic feature? Comparison to the properties of compact conformations of artificially generated compact protein structures selected for thermodynamic stability but not any type of function, the artificial (ART) protein library, demonstrates that a remarkable number of the properties of native-like proteins are recapitulated. These include the complete set of small molecule ligand-binding pockets and most protein-protein interfaces. ART structures are predicted {{to be capable of}} weakly binding metabolites and cover a significant fraction of metabolic pathways, with the most enriched pathways including ancient ones such as glycolysis.

40|$|Summary Factor (F) VIII is an {{essential}} cofactor in the enzymatic coagulation cascade. A defect in the gene encoding for FVIII results in the X-linked inherited bleeding disorder hemophilia A. In the circulation, FVIII is protected from proteolytic degradation and premature clearance by forming a complex with its carrier protein von Willebrand factor (VWF). While the complex of FVIII and VWF involves one of the <b>strongest</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interactions in the human body, it has remained unclear when and where FVIII and VWF first interact. The most widely accepted view is that FVIII and VWF are secreted from different cells and form a complex in the circulation, merely {{by virtue of their}} high-affinity interaction. During the last decade however, increasing evidence has been presented that suggests that the human body should also comprise a releasable storage pool of both proteins. In this thesis, we have studied the relationship between high-affinity interaction in the circulation and intracellular co-storage of FVIII and VWF. We have taken a new approach towards this issue by creating fluorescently tagged VWF and FVIII proteins that are established as being deficient in high-affinity interaction. We have demonstrated that FVIII is stored in VWF-containing storage organelles in absence of high-affinity interaction and that the extent of FVIII storage is independent of its affinity for VWF. In addition, we studied the therapeutic benefit of intracellular co-expression of FVIII and VWF in terms of potential treatment options for hemophilia A. We have shown that blood outgrowth endothelial cells can produce high levels of functional FVIII over a prolonged period of time. In addition, we have demonstrated that a substantial amount of FVIII can be stored in VWF-containing storage organelles whereas the majority of FVIII is released in a constitutive manner. From our data, we conclude that the structural requirements that determine high-affinity interaction between FVIII and VWF in the circulation differ from those that determine intracellular co-trafficking. Our data provide a molecular explanation for the fact that hemophilia A and von Willebrand’s disease patients that suffer from impaired complex assembly of FVIII and VWF in the circulation show concomitant increase of FVIII and VWF plasma levels following treatment with desmopressin. The mechanism that determines FVIII storage in VWF-containing granules as well as the therapeutic potential of FVIII expression in VWF producing cells now awaits further exploration...|$|R

We used the yeast two-hybrid assay to identify interactions among all the mature proteins of the hepatitis C virus. The interaction between NS 3 and NS 3 {{was one of the}} <b>strongest</b> viral <b>protein-protein</b> interactions detected. The minimal region required for this interaction was mapped to a specific subdomain of 174 amino acids in the N terminus of the helicase region. Random mutations in the minimal region were generated by PCR, and mutants that failed to interact with a wild-type minimal fragment were isolated using the yeast two-hybrid assay as a screen. Three of these mutations resulted in a reduction or a loss of interaction between helicases. Analytical gel filtration showed that in the presence of an oligonucleotide, wild-type helicases form dimers whereas the mutants remain mostly monomeric. All three mutants were partially or almost inactive when assayed for helicase activity in vitro. Mixing a mutant helicase (Y 267 S) with wild-type helicase did not dramatically affect helicase activity. These data indicate that dimerization of the helicase is important for helicase activity. The mutations that reduce self-association of the helicase may define the key residues involved in NS 3 -NS 3 dimerization...|$|R

Having done so we consider two physical phenomena in the cytoplasm: diffusion and possible phase separation. Diffusion is slower in the highly crowded cytoplasm than in dilute solution. Reasonable estimates of this slowdown can be obtained and their consequences explored, for example, monomer-dimer equilibria are established approximately twenty times slower than in a dilute solution. Phase separation in all except exceptional cells appears not to be a problem, despite the high density and so <b>strong</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interactions present.

40|$|AbstractMason–Pfizer {{monkey virus}} (M-PMV) Gag protein {{contains}} a domain p 12 that {{is unique to}} this virus (simian retrovirus- 3) and its close relatives. The α-helical N-terminal half of p 12, which contains a leucine zipper-like region, forms ordered structures in E. coli and the C-terminal half can form SDS-resistant oligomers in vitro. Together these properties suggest that p 12 is a <b>strong</b> <b>protein–protein</b> interaction domain that facilitates Gag–Gag oligomerization. We have analyzed the oligomerization potential of a panel of p 12 mutants, including versions containing substituted dimer, trimer, and tetramer leucine zippers, expressed in bacteria and {{in the context of}} the Gag precursor expressed in vitro and in cells. Purified recombinant p 12 and its mutants could form various oligomers as shown by chemical cross-linking experiments. Within Gag these same mutants could assemble when overexpressed in cells. In contrast, all the mutants, including the leucine zipper mutants, were assembly defective in a cell-free system. These data highlight the importance of a region containing alternating leucines and isoleucines within p 12, but also indicate that this domain's scaffold-like function is more complex than small number oligomerization...|$|E

Methods and Results:  Protein–protein interactions were investigated using the yeast two-hybrid system. A <b>strong</b> <b>protein–protein</b> interaction was detected between the transmembrane activation protein Wzd and the protein tyrosine kinase Wze. Weaker protein–protein interactions were detected between two duplicate Wze proteins and between Wze and the phosphotyrosine phosphatase Wzh. Protein–protein interactions involving a Wzd/Wze fusion protein and Wzd and Wze {{may indicate that}} these proteins form multi-protein complexes. All combinations of the Wzh, Wzd, Wze, Wzg (regulation), CpsE (glycosyl- 1 -phosphate transferase), CpsS (polymerization), CpsL (unknown), CpsW (regulation) and CpsU (membrane translocation) were analysed for protein–protein interactions but no additional interactions were discovered using the yeast two-hybrid system. Conclusions:  Interactions among the phosphotyrosine phosphatase, tyrosine kinase, and transmembrane activation protein are important in the regulation of capsule biosynthesis in Strep. thermophilus MR- 1 C. Significance and Impact of the Study:  This study provides some valuable insight into the organization and interactions between the many proteins involved in EPS production.

The drag force required to detach the beads is used to determine the affinity of the bond holding the two molecules together. The minimum force we are able to detect is 5 pN.

30|$|The largest nonspecific force {{observed}} in sulphathiazole sodium solution (Figure 4 b) {{could be attributed}} to the effect of increasing solution ionic strength (IS). Both BSA and rabbit anti-BSA are negatively charged when immersed in solution (pH 7.4), as the isoelectric points of BSA and rabbit anti-BSA are 4.7, 4.8 - 5.2, respectively [35]. Increasing the solution IS compressed the thickness of the electrostatic double layer surrounding proteins, and finally resulted in an increase in nonspecific adhesion. This phenomenon is qualitatively consistent with predictions based on DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek) theory as an increase in the solution IS will reduce the range of electrostatic repulsion between two negatively charged surfaces [36, 37]. Similar effect was reported by Javid et al. [6]. They observed that the positive charge on the lysozyme molecule was screened by the salt anions as the salt concentration increased, hence diminishing the <b>strong</b> repulsive <b>protein-protein</b> interactions. In addition, increasing the solution IS may disrupt the hydration shell coating on protein surfaces and thus reduce repulsive interactions between the two interacting surfaces [38]. Benítez et al. [39] studied the effect of IS on the stability of apple juice particles which are mainly composed of proteins and carbohydrates. They concluded that increasing IS resulted in reduction of surface charge and hydration constant, and led to an increase in adhesion. Compared with tylosin molecule, the spatial structure of sulphathiazole sodium salt in solution is smaller and sulphathiazole sodium molecules may not cover available binding sites and weaken the specific adhesion between antigen and antibody. In levofloxacin solution, the specific adhesion force and nonspecific force are almost equal to the force values in PBS. This suggests that levofloxacin as a small nonionic drug may not affect the interactions of BSA and rabbit anti-BSA because of neither bigger spatial structure of levofloxacin molecule nor increasing IS in solution.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{combined}} {{effects of}} concentration and pH on the conformational states of bovine serum albumin (BSA) are investigated by small-angle x-ray scattering. Serum albumins, at physiological conditions, are found at concentrations of ∼ 35 – 45 mg/mL (42 mg/mL {{in the case}} of humans). In this work, BSA at three different concentrations (10, 25, and 50 mg/mL) and pH values (2. 0 – 9. 0) have been studied. Data were analyzed by means of the Global Fitting procedure, with the protein form factor calculated from human serum albumin (HSA) crystallographic structure and the interference function described, considering repulsive and attractive interaction potentials within a random phase approximation. Small-angle x-ray scattering data show that BSA maintains its native state from pH 4. 0 up to 9. 0 at all investigated concentrations. A pH-dependence of the absolute net protein charge is shown and the charge number per BSA is quantified to 10 (2), 8 (1), 13 (2), 20 (2), and 26 (2) for pH values 4. 0, 5. 4, 7. 0, 8. 0, and 9. 0, respectively. The attractive potential diminishes as BSA concentration increases. The coexistence of monomers and dimers is observed at 50 mg/mL and pH 5. 4, near the BSA isoelectric point. Samples at pH 2. 0 show a different behavior, because BSA overall shape changes as a function of concentration. At 10 mg/mL, BSA is partially unfolded and a <b>strong</b> repulsive <b>protein-protein</b> interaction occurs due to the high amount of exposed charge. At 25 and 50 mg/mL, BSA undergoes some re-folding, which likely results in a molten-globule state. This work concludes by confirming that the protein concentration plays an important role on the pH-unfolded BSA state, due to a delicate compromise between interaction forces and crowding effects...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we review}} the {{development}} of protein scaling theory, starting from backgrounds in mathematics and statistical mechanics, and leading to biomedical applications. Evolution has organized each protein family in different ways, but scaling theory is both simple and effective in providing readily transferable dynamical insights complementary for many proteins represented in the 90 thousand static structures contained in the online Protein Data Base (PDB). Scaling theory is a simplifying magic wand that enables one to search {{the hundreds of millions}} of protein articles in the Web of Science, and identify those proteins that present new cost-effective methods for early detection and/or treatment of disease through individual protein sequences (personalized medicine). Critical point theory is general, and recently it has proved to be the most effective way of describing protein networks that have evolved towards nearly perfect functionality in given environments (self-organized criticality). Evolutionary patterns are governed by common scaling principles, which can be quantified using scales that have been developed bioinformatically by studying thousands of PDB structures. The most effective scales involve either hydropathic globular sculpting interactions averaged over length scales centered on membrane dimensions, or exposed beta strand propensities associated with aggregative (<b>strong)</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interactions.

To begin to determine which of the proteins in this family are essential for pore function, antisera were raised to each of three members of the family, p 62, p 58, and p 54. With these antisera, it was possible to deplete nuclear reconstitution extracts of the proteins and to test the depleted nuclei for nuclear transport. In the course of the experiments, {{it was found that the}} three proteins exist as a complex; antisera to any one, while specific on a protein blot, coimmunoprecipitated all three proteins. This complex of pore proteins is stable to 2 M salt, 2 M urea, and the detergent Mega 10, indicating the presence of specific and tight protein-protein interactions. By gel filtration, the complex has a molecular mass of 550 - 600 kD. Nuclei containing pores depleted of the complex are found to be defective for nuclear transport; moreover, we observe a strict linear correlation between the amount of complex present in nuclei and the amount of nuclear transport of which those nuclei are capable. Thus, the p 62 -p 58 - p 54 complex defines a group of proteins with <b>strong</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interactions that form a unit of pore structure essential for pore function...|$|E

RESULTS: We construct a model of 'research communities' sampling from real gene network data and machine learning methods to characterize performance trends. Our analysis reveals an important principle limiting the value of replication, namely that targeting it directly causes 'easy' or uninformative replication to dominate analyses. We find that when sampling across network data and algorithms with similar variability, the relationship between replicability and accuracy is positive (Spearman's correlation, rs ~ 0. 33) but where no such constraint is imposed, the relationship becomes negative for a given gene function (rs ~ - 0. 13). We predict factors driving replicability in some prior analyses of gene networks and show that they are unconnected with the correctness of the original result, instead reflecting replicable biases. Without these biases, the original results also vanish replicably. We show these effects can occur quite far upstream in network data, {{and that there is a}} <b>strong</b> tendency within <b>protein-protein</b> interaction data for highly replicable interactions to be associated with poor quality-control.

40|$|In {{order to}} resolve the {{functional}} role of intact rRNA in polypeptide chain elongation mouse brain ribosomes were treated with dilute pancreatic or T 1 RNAase (ribonuclease). After RNAase treatment, several physical–chemical properties {{as well as the}} functional activity of the ribosomes were measured. RNAase treatment resulted in the extensive hydrolysis of both 18 S and 28 S rRNA; however, the sedimentation properties of mono-ribosomes were unaltered and more than 90 % of the relatively low-molecular-weight RNA fragments remained associated with ribosome particles. Analysis of the ability of RNAase-treated ribosomes to participate in cell-free protein synthesis showed that ribosomes with less than 2 % intact rRNA retained more than 85 % of their activity in polyphenylalanine incorporation. Proof that the incorporation of phenylalanine by ribosomes with hydrolysed rRNA actually represented active translocation was obtained by the effective inhibition of incorporation by diphtheria toxin. In addition, the oligopeptide products of protein synthesis could be identified by BD (benzoylated diethylaminoethyl) -cellulose column chromatography. Analysis of the size distribution of oligopeptides synthesized by normal and RNAase-treated ribosomes showed no significant differences which indicated that there was no change in the proportion of ribosomes engaged in protein synthesis. Thus <b>strong</b> RNA–protein and <b>protein–protein</b> interactions must serve to maintain the functional integrity of ribosomes even when the rRNA is extensively degraded. The ability of the enzyme-treated ribosomes to efficiently incorporate amino acids clearly demonstrated that `intact' rRNA is not required for protein-synthetic activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{vast and}} growing volume of 3 D protein {{structural}} data {{stored in the}} PDB contains abundant information about macromolecular complexes, and hence, data about protein interfaces. Non-covalent contacts between amino acids are the basis of protein interactions, and {{they are responsible for}} binding afinity and specificity in biological processes. In addition, water networks in protein interfaces can also complement direct interactions contributing significantly to molecular recognition, although their exact role is still not well understood. It is estimated that protein complexes in the PDB are substantially underrepresented due to their crystallization dificulties. Methods for automatic classifification and description of the protein complexes are essential to study protein interfaces, and to propose putative binding regions. Due to this <b>strong</b> need, several <b>protein-protein</b> interaction databases have been developed. However, most of them do not take into account either protein-peptide complexes, solvent information or a proper classification of the binding regions, which are fundamental components to provide an accurate description of protein interfaces. In the firest stage of my thesis, I developed the SCOWLP platform, a database and web application that structurally classifies protein binding regions at family level and defines accurately protein interfaces at atomic detail. The analysis of the results showed that protein-peptide complexes are substantially represented in the PDB, and are the only source of interacting information for several families. By clustering the family binding regions, I could identify 9, 334 binding regions and 79, 803 protein interfaces in the PDB. Interestingly, I observed that 65 % of protein families interact to other molecules through more than one region and in 22 % of the cases the same region recognizes different protein families. The database and web application are open to the research community (www. scowlp. org) and can tremendously facilitate high-throughput comparative analysis of protein binding regions, as well as, individual analysis of protein interfaces. SCOWLP and the other databases collect and classify the protein binding regions at family level, where sequence and structure homology exist. Interestingly, it has been observed that many protein families also present structural resemblances within each other, mostly across folds. Likewise, structurally similar interacting motifs (binding regions) have been identified among proteins with different folds and functions. For these reasons, I decided to explore the possibility to infer protein binding regions independently of their fold classification. Thus, I performed the firest systematic analysis of binding region conservation within all protein families that are structurally similar, calculated using non-sequential structural alignment methods. My results indicate there is a substantial molecular recognition information that could be potentially inferred among proteins beyond family level. I obtained a 6 to 8 fold enrichment of binding regions, and identified putative binding regions for 728 protein families that lack binding information. Within the results, I found out protein complexes from different folds that present similar interfaces, confirming the predictive usage of the methodology. The data obtained with my approach may complement the SCOWLP family binding regions suggesting alternative binding regions, and can be used to assist protein-protein docking experiments and facilitate rational ligand design. In the last part of my thesis, I used the interacting information contained in the SCOWLP database to help understand the role that water plays in protein interactions in terms of affinity and specificity. I carried out one of the firest high-throughput analysis of solvent in protein interfaces for a curated dataset of transient and obligate protein complexes. Surprisingly, the results highlight the abundance of water-bridged residues in protein interfaces (40. 1 % of the interfacial residues) that reinforces the importance of including solvent in protein interaction studies (14. 5 % extra residues interacting only water- mediated). Interestingly, I also observed that obligate and transient interfaces present a comparable amount of solvent, which contrasts the old thoughts saying that obligate protein complexes are expected to exhibit similarities to protein cores having a dry and hydrophobic interfaces. I characterized novel features of water-bridged residues in terms of secondary structure, temperature factors, residue composition, and pairing preferences that differed from direct residue-residue interactions. The results also showed relevant aspects in the mobility and energetics of water-bridged interfacial residues. Collectively, my doctoral thesis work can be summarized in the following points: 1. I developed SCOWLP, an improved framework that identiffies protein interfaces and classifies protein binding regions at family level. 2. I developed a novel methodology to predict alternative binding regions among structurally similar protein families independently of the fold they belong to. 3. I performed a high-throughput analysis of water-bridged interactions contained in SCOWLP to study the role of solvent in protein interfaces. These three components of my thesis represent novel methods for exploiting existing structural information to gain insights into protein- protein interactions, key mechanisms to understand biological processes...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial cell {{division}} is mediated {{by a set}} of proteins that assemble to form a large multiprotein complex called the divisome. Recent studies in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli indicate that {{cell division}} proteins are involved in multiple cooperative binding interactions, thus presenting a technical challenge to the analysis of these interactions. We report here the use of an E. coli artificial septal targeting system for examining the interactions between the B. subtilis cell division proteins DivIB, FtsL, DivIC, and PBP 2 B. This technique involves the fusion of one of the proteins (the “bait”) to ZapA, an E. coli protein targeted to mid-cell, and the fusion of a second potentially interacting partner (the “prey”) to green fluorescent protein (GFP). A positive interaction between two test proteins in E. coli leads to septal localization of the GFP fusion construct, which can be detected by fluorescence microscopy. Using this system, we present evidence for two sets of <b>strong</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interactions between B. subtilis divisomal proteins in E. coli, namely, DivIC with FtsL and DivIB with PBP 2 B, that are independent of other B. subtilis cell division proteins and that do not disturb the cytokinesis process in the host cell. Our studies based on the coexpression of three or four of these B. subtilis cell division proteins suggest that interactions among these four proteins are not strong enough to allow the formation of a stable four-protein complex in E. coli in contrast to previous suggestions. Finally, our result...|$|E
40|$|Coiled coil {{interactions}} are <b>strong</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interactions {{that are involved}} in many biological processes, including intracellular trafficking and membrane fusion. A synthetic heterodimeric coiled-coil forming peptide pair, known as E 3 (EIAALEK) 3 and K 3 (KIAALKE) 3 was used to functionalize liposomes encapsulating a splice correcting oligonucleotide or siRNA. These peptide-functionalized vesicles are highly stable in solution but start to cluster when vesicles modified with complementary peptides are mixed together, demonstrating that the peptides quickly coil and crosslink the vesicles. When one of the peptides was anchored to the cell membrane using a hydrophobic cholesterol anchor, vesicles functionalized with the complementary peptide could be docked to these cells, whereas non-functionalized cells did not show any vesicle tethering. Although the anchored peptides do not have a downstream signaling pathway, microscopy pictures revealed that after four hours, the majority of the docked vesicles were internalized by endocytosis. Finally, for the first time, it was shown that the coiled coil assembly at the interface between the vesicles and the cell membrane induces active uptake and leads to cytosolic delivery of the nucleic acid cargo. Both the siRNA and the splice correcting oligonucleotide were functionally delivered, resulting respectively in the silencing or recovery of luciferase expression in the appropriate cell lines. These results demonstrate that the docking to the cell by coiled coil interaction can induce active uptake and achieve the successful intracellular delivery of otherwise membrane impermeable nucleic acids in a highly specific manner...|$|E

Previously, we have reported isolation and characterization of ESTs from Salicornia with large number of novel/unknown salt-responsive gene sequences. In this study, we have selected a novel salt-inducible gene SbSI- 2 (Salicornia brachiata salt-inducible- 2) for functional characterization. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that SbSI- 2 protein has predicted nuclear localization signals and a <b>strong</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interaction domain. Transient expression of the RFP:SbSI 2 fusion protein confirmed that SbSI- 2 is a nuclear-localized protein. Genomic organization study showed that SbSI- 2 is intronless and has a single copy in Salicornia genome. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed higher SbSI- 2 expression under salt stress and desiccation conditions. The SbSI- 2 gene was transformed in E. coli and tobacco for functional characterization. pET 28 a-SbSI- 2 recombinant E. coli cells showed higher tolerance to desiccation and salinity compared to vector alone. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing SbSI- 2 have improved salt- and osmotic tolerance, accompanied by better growth parameters, higher relative water content, elevated accumulation of compatible osmolytes, lower Na+ and ROS accumulation and lesser electrolyte leakage than the wild-type. Overexpression of the SbSI- 2 also enhanced transcript levels of ROS-scavenging genes and some stress-related transcription factors under salt and osmotic stresses. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SbSI- 2 might play an important positive modulation role in abiotic stress tolerance. This identifies SbSI- 2 as a novel determinant of salt/osmoti...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{family of}} {{proteins}} bearing novel N-acetylglucosamine residues {{has previously been}} found to be required to form functional nuclear pores. To begin to determine which of the proteins in this family are essential for pore function, antisera were raised to each of three members of the family, p 62, p 58, and p 54. With these antisera, it was possible to deplete nuclear reconstitution extracts of the proteins and to test the depleted nuclei for nuclear transport. In the course of the experiments, {{it was found that the}} three proteins exist as a complex; antisera to any one, while specific on a protein blot, coimmunoprecipitated all three proteins. This complex of pore proteins is stable to 2 M salt, 2 M urea, and the detergent Mega 10, indicating the presence of specific and tight protein-protein interactions. By gel filtration, the complex has a molecular mass of 550 - 600 kD. Nuclei containing pores depleted of the complex are found to be defective for nuclear transport; moreover, we observe a strict linear correlation between the amount of complex present in nuclei and the amount of nuclear transport of which those nuclei are capable. Thus, the p 62 -p 58 -p 54 complex defines a group of proteins with <b>strong</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interactions that form a unit of pore structure essential for pore function. THE nuclear pore is a large and complex supramolecular assembly, estimated to be 120, 000, 000 D in mass (Reichelt et al., 1990). The pore is responsible for the regulated import ofnuclear proteins and snRNPs (for review...|$|E
40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} {{was used}} to study the structure of two membrane-associated proteins adsorbed to various supported phospholipid bilayers in physiological buffer. The aim was (a) to develop a preparation for the investigation of membrane-associated proteins at high resolution under native conditions and (b) to obtain information about the factors that determine the adsorption process {{and the structure of}} adsorbed proteins. Therefore, solid-supported membranes were formed on mica by spontaneous vesicle adsorption and spreading. Once a homogeneous, pinhole-free bilayer was formed, solutions containing the proteins at appropriate concentrations were applied. The two positively charged proteins chosen were myelin basic protein (MBP), which plays an essential role in the formation of functional myelin, and cytochrome c. On charged bilayers, MBP applied at concentrations of 0. 5 - 50 µg/mL formed aggregates of defined height (1. 9 (0. 2 nm on negatively and 2. 7 (0. 2 nm on positively charged lipids), which at high concentration covered the entire bilayer. These aggregates are probably monomolecular layers of MBP. On neutral lipid adsorbed MBP formed irregular aggregates. Cytochrome c showed a different adsorption: On negatively charged lipid it formed aggregates of defined, monomolecular height (3. 3 (0. 2 nm). On neutral bilayers small aggregates were observed. On positively charged lipid no adsorption was observed at all. These results indicate that (a) the adsorption of cytomchrome c can be interpreted in terms of a dominating electrostatic interaction; (b) MBP adsorption to lipid bilayers is not exclusively electrostatically driven and depends on the specific lipid bilayer composition; (c) the structure of adsorbed aggregates indicates a <b>strong</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{flexibility}} of the tryptophan side chains of gramicidin A and the rotational diffusion of the peptide in methanolic solution and in three membrane systems were studied with deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Gramicidin A was selectively deuterated at the aromatic ring systems of its four tryptophan side chains. In methanolic solution, the tryptophan residues remained immobile {{and served as a}} probe for the overall rotation of the peptide. The experimentally determined rotational correlation time of tau c = 0. 6 X 10 (- 9) s was consistent with the formation of gramicidin A dimers. For gramicidin A incorporated into bilayer membranes, quite different results were obtained depending on the chemical and physical nature of the lipids employed. When mixed with 1 -palmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (LPPC) at a stoichiometric lipid:peptide ratio of 4 : 1, gramicidin A induced the formation of stable bilayer membranes in which the lipids were highly fluid. In contrast, the gramicidin A molecules of this membrane remained completely static over a large temperature interval, suggesting <b>strong</b> <b>protein-protein</b> interactions. The peptide molecules appeared to form a rigid two-dimensional lattice in which the interstitial spaces were filled with fluidlike lipids. When gramicidin A was incorporated into bilayers of 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine or 1, 2 -dimyristoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DMPC) above the lipid phase transition, the deuterium NMR spectra were motionally narrowed, indicating large-amplitude rotational fluctuations. From the measurement of the quadrupole echo relaxation time, a rotational correlation time of 2 X 10 (- 7) s was estimated, leading to a membrane viscosity of 1 - 2 P if the rotational unit was assumed to be a gramicidin A dimer.
