With a complex test of concentration two facets <b>of</b> concentrated <b>work</b> can be measured reliably and validly: <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> concentrated <b>work</b> and percentage <b>of</b> concentration errors. Two studies were conducted to test whether the Complex-Concentration-Test is suitable for assessing the cognitive deficit caused by chronic pain. In Study I, 60 chronic pain patients in Germany, and in Study II, 86 patients in Austria, completed a standardized interview on pain, the Complex-Concentration-Test, the visual-analogue-scale for pain intensity, the Pain-Experience-Scale, the Pain-Disability-Index, {{as well as the}} General-Depression-Scale.

40|$|Background: Among {{the most}} {{important}} and effective factors affecting the efficiency of the human workforce are accuracy, promptness, and ability. In the context of promoting levels and quality of productivity, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of exposure to noise on the rate of errors, <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> and capability in performing manual activities. Methods: This experimental study was conducted on 96 students (52 female and 44 male) of the Isfahan Medical Science University with the average and standard deviations of age, height, and weight of 22. 81 (3. 04) years, 171. 67 (8. 51) cm, and 65. 05 (13. 13) kg, respectively. Sampling was conducted with a randomized block design. Along with controlling for intervening factors, a combination of sound pressure levels [65 dB (A), 85 dB (A), and 95 dB (A) ] and exposure times (0, 20, and 40) were used for evaluation of precision and speed of action of the participants, in the ergonomic test of two-hand coordination. Data was analyzed by SPSS 18 software using a descriptive and analytical statistical method by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) repeated measures. Results: The results of this study showed that increasing sound pressure level from 65 to 95 dB in network ′A′ increased the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> (P 0. 05). Male participants got annoyed from the noise more than females. Also, increase in sound pressure level increased the rate of error (P < 0. 05).
