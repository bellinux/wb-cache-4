Banksy unveiled {{at least one}} work of art daily, documenting it on both a dedicated website and an Instagram account. The majority of the works were <b>stencil</b> graffiti and chiefly political, a distinctive characteristic of Banksy. Other pieces and multimedia exhibits toyed with dark humor and satire.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} defacement, fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced. A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a <b>stencil</b> painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs. Some took {{matters into their own hands}} by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced. In part because of the defacement, but also because of the great value of the artworks, property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art. Some hired security guards, others covered the art with acrylic glass, and yet others installed metal roll-down gates.|$|E

5|$|According to John Carmack, {{the lead}} {{graphics}} engine developer at id Software, {{the technology of}} Doom 3 was supported by three primary features: unified lighting and shadowing, complex animations and scripting that showed real-time with fully dynamic per-pixel lighting and <b>stencil</b> shadowing, and GUI surfaces that add extra interactivity to the game. The key advance of the id Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is the unified lighting and shadowing. Rather than computing or rendering lightmaps during map creation and saving that information in the map data, most light sources are computed in real-time. This allows lights to cast shadows even on non-static objects such as monsters and machinery, which was impossible with static non-directional lightmaps. A shortcoming {{of this approach is}} the engine's inability to render soft shadows and global illumination.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Warhol began {{producing}} {{his first}} canvases, which he based on comic strip subjects. In late 1961, {{he learned the}} process of silkscreening from Floriano Vecchi, who had run the Tiber Press since 1953. Though the process generally begins with a <b>stencil</b> drawing, it often evolves from a blown up photograph which is then transferred with glue onto silk. In either case, one needs to produce a glue-based version of a positive two-dimensional image (positive means that open spaces are left where the paint will appear). Usually, the ink is rolled across the medium so that it passes through the silk and not the glue. Campbell's Soup cans were among Warhol's first silkscreen productions; the first were U.S. dollar bills. The pieces were made from stencils; one for each color. Warhol did not begin to convert photographs to silkscreens until after the original series of Campbell's Soup cans had been produced.|$|E

The series was first {{published}} in Enix's Monthly <b>Stencil</b> in January 2001, was later obtained by Mag Garden who published it in Monthly Comic Blade then Monthly Comic Avarus where it concluded its serialization in August 2011. The individual chapters were collected and released into eight tankōbon volumes by Mag Garden. A continuation of the manga, subtitled as , was serialized in Mag Garden's online magazine, Web Comic Beat's, between June 2012 and March 2013; it was later released in a single tankōbon volume. In Japan, Boku to Kanojo no Peke Mittsu has been adapted into three radio dramas and a live action film. Your and My Secret follows the effeminate Akira Uehara who switches bodies with the tomboy Nanako Momoi due to an accident.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a method for}} design of optimal finite-difference <b>stencils</b> for wave propagation problems using an intrinsically explicit Galerkin-wavelet formulation. The method enables an efficient choice of <b>stencils</b> optimal for a certain problem. We compare group velocity curves corresponding to <b>stencils</b> obtained by our choice of wavelet basis and traditional finite-difference schemes. Generally there exist choices of <b>stencils</b> with superior characteristics compared to conventional finite-difference <b>stencils</b> of the same size. Beside gain in accuracy, this leads to large computational savings. 1 Introduction In this paper we propose an effective method for designing finite-difference <b>stencils</b> optimal for specific wave propagation problems.

We present an approach that yields <b>stencils</b> of minimal size, which are positive. We provide conditions on the point cloud geometry, so that positive <b>stencils</b> always exist. The new discretization method is compared to least squares approaches in terms of accuracy and computational performance. ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>stencil</b> {{duplicator}} or mimeograph {{machine is}} a low-cost printing press that works by forcing ink through a <b>stencil</b> onto paper. Once prepared, the <b>stencil</b> is {{wrapped around the}} ink-filled drum of the rotary machine. When a blank sheet of paper is drawn between the rotating drum and a pressure roller, ink is forced through the holes on the <b>stencil</b> onto the paper.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} plasma <b>stencilling</b> techniques for patterning 10 mammalian cell lines on hydrophobic and cell repellent poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), methylated glass and bacterial grade polystyrene surfaces. An air plasma produced with a Tesla generator operating at atmospheric pressure was used with micro-engineered <b>stencils</b> for patterned surface oxidation, selectively transforming {{the surface to}} a hydrophilic state to enable cell adhesion and growth. Plasma <b>stencilling</b> obviates the need for directly patterning cell adhesion molecules. Instead, during cell culture, adhesion proteins from the media assemble in a bioactive form on the hydrophilic regions. Critically, the removal of protein patterning prior to cell culture provides the option to also use PDMS-PDMS plasma bonding to incorporate cell patterns within microfluidic systems. Linear patterns were generated using PDMS microchannel <b>stencils,</b> and polyimide <b>stencils</b> with through holes {{were used for the}} production of cellular arrays. For the production of smaller cellular arrays, a novel microcapillary-based dielectric barrier discharge system was developed. A numerical method to characterise the cell patterns is also introduced and was used to demonstrate that plasma <b>stencilling</b> is highly effective, with complete patterns confined during long term cell culture (> 10 days). In summary, plasma <b>stencilling</b> is simple, rapid, inexpensive, reproducible and a potentially universal cell line patterning capability...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the image interpolation problem where given an image vm,n with uniformly-sampled pixels vm,n and point spread function h, {{the goal is}} to find function u(x,y) satisfying vm,n = (h*u) (m,n) for all m,n in Z. This article improves upon the IPOL article Image Interpolation with Contour <b>Stencils.</b> In the previous work, contour <b>stencils</b> are used to estimate the image contours locally as short line segments. This article begins with a continuous formulation of total variation integrated over a collection of curves and defines contour <b>stencils</b> as a consistent discretization. This discretization is more reliable than the previous approach and can effectively distinguish contours that are locally shaped like lines, curves, corners, and circles. These improved contour <b>stencils</b> sense more of the geometry in the image. Interpolation is performed using an extension of the method described in the previous article. Using the improved contour <b>stencils,</b> there is an increase in image quality while maintaining similar computational efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Hand <b>stencils</b> {{are some}} of the most {{enduring}} images in Upper Palaeolithic rock art sites across the world; the earliest have been dated to over 40 Kya in Sulawesi and 37 Kya in Europe. The analysis of these marks may permit us to know more about who was involved in the making the of prehistoric images as well as expanding the literature on the evolution of human behaviour. A number of researchers have previously attempted to identify the sex of the makers of Upper Palaeolithic hand <b>stencils</b> using methods based on hand size and digit length ratios obtained from digital or photo-based images of modern reference samples. Some analyses report that it was males who were responsible for the majority of hand <b>stencils,</b> whilst the most recent analysis determined that females produced the majority of hand <b>stencils.</b> Taken together, however, these studies generate contrasting and incompatible interpretations. In this study we critically review where we currently stand with methods of sexing the makers of hand <b>stencils</b> and the problems for the interpretation of hand markings of Palaeolithic age. We then present the results of a new method of predicting the sex of individuals from their hand <b>stencils</b> using a geometric morpho-metric approach that detects sexual differences in hand shape and hand form (size and shape). The method has the additional advantage of being able to detect these differences in both complete, as well as partial hand <b>stencils.</b> Finally we urge researchers to test this method on other ethnic groups and populations and consider ways of combining efforts towards a common goal of developing a robust, predictive methodology based on diverse modern samples before it is applied to Upper Palaeolithic hand <b>stencils...</b>|$|R
