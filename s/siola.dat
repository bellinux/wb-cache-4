Related to cattle, goats, and antelopes, the species was defined {{following}} a discovery of remains in 1992 in Vũ Quang Nature Reserve by a joint survey of the Vietnamese Ministry of Forestry and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Saolas have since been kept in captivity multiple times, although only for short periods. A living saola in the wild was first photographed in 1999 by a camera trap set by WWF and the Vietnamese government’s Forest Protection Department (SFNC).|$|E
5000|$|At Cheltenham on 13 March, More Of That {{started at}} odds of 15/2 for the Grade I World Hurdle over a {{distance}} of three miles. He was ridden by Geraghty as McCoy had opted to ride the other McManus runner At Fishers Cross. The betting was headed by the mare Annie Power, unbeaten {{at that time in}} ten races and Big Buck's who had won the race on four previous occasions, while the other contenders included the Grade I winners Zarkandar, Celestial Halo and Reve de <b>Siola.</b> Geraghty held the gelding up in the early stages before moving up to dispute the lead approaching the final hurdle. More Of That got the better of Annie Power on the run-in and won by one and a half lengths, with At Fishers Cross five lengths back in third. After the race Geraghty said: [...] "He still is a little bit innocent but he's got an engine. I always felt I had the finish". Jonjo O'Neill commented [...] "We were very pleased with the horse and he was in great old form. Jumping the last, I thought he would keep galloping. I had a little {{doubt in my mind that}} Annie Power might not quite get home but she gave us a fair fright".|$|E

40|$|This text {{defines the}} Business Centre of Naples {{as a place}} that undoubtely {{requires}} new transformation, a ‘periphery’, not in a topological meaning but certainly of sense, a place ‘on the margins’. The “Plan for the reconstruction of Porto, Mercato and Pendino districts” of 1946 by Luigi Cosenza and the project elaborated for the “Competition for the new Courthouse of Naples” by Salvatore Bisogni, Luigi Pisciotti, Agostino Renna and Uberto <b>Siola</b> are presented as two lost opportunities of solving, {{in a different way}} related to the mono-functionality that characterizes the Business Centre, the request for tertiary buildings and facilities in Naples. The work of the Laboratory directed by Giovanni Multari faces some issues already posed by these ‘excellent’ projects, sharing with them especially the choice of introducing a mix of functions as necessary condition to build a liveable city. The presence of many different functions is able to guarantee also a morphological articulation of urban spaces and buildings here placed and will made this part of the city experienced by people with different needs in different times of the day: those that move here for working, those that live here, those that will find a reason to spend here their leisure time. The project of the open public space is central in this kind of project and aims to ‘give measure’ – proportions – to the huge open spaces of the Business Centre. It is really interesting that, to do this, the project evokes, in an analogical reference, the places of the historical city of Naples: the decumanus and the cardines, a square that looks like a forum. Those are the reasons why the text is titled Diversity as a value for the architecture of the city a diversity – functional, morphological, related to different ways of living these places – that the projects of the Lab directed by Giovanni Multari aimed, as a whole, to realize in the Business Centre of Naples...|$|E

The slope of the ground from the railway to the urban fabric was used to cover the rails and the current walls between Pietrarsa and the Granatello advanced to obtain the reconstruction of the ancient topography: in this way it is possible to obtain the functional reconnection with the sea and a figurative and architectural reconfiguration of the historical construction. Villa d'Elboeuf foundational element of this formal and architectural world: the design of the harbour basin is referred to the villa, based on a central axis, attested to the ground. The 530 boat places guarantee the financial feasibility of the whole operation, inscribing old and new port in a measure and in a recognizable and unitary relationship. On the wall, the ground, arranged as a green area, was a continuing of the Royal Palace Park and composed, through a paratactic principle, the alignments and positions of the historical design. The advance beyond the rails of the embankment allowed the reconnection of the urban fabric and villas to the sea and the definition of a waterfront where the villa Menna bastion and the villa Lauro Lancellotti kaffee haus - moved {{on the other side of}} the rails as connection between the villa and the sea - were clearly placed. The dock at Pietrarsa was part of this ordered redrawing of the whole waterfront...|$|E
