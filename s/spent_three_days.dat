5|$|In 1945 Moore {{accompanied}} the British 11th Armoured Division when they liberated the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. He <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> sketching and painting {{the state of}} the camp, its prisoners and their captors, including Fritz Klein. It was suggested by one soldier that nobody would believe the portrayals, prompting Moore to also photograph the scenes as proof.|$|E
5|$|Coldwell {{suffered}} from a heart condition, and undertook a much less ambitious schedule than the major party leaders. The party leader left Ottawa for his riding, Rosetown—Biggar in Saskatchewan, on April 26, and remained there until May 10. He <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> campaigning in Ontario, then moved west to the major cities of the prairie provinces and British Columbia, before returning to his riding for the final days before the June 10 election. Other CCF leaders took charge of campaigning in Quebec and the Maritimes.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{began working}} on the story in 2004, {{which was based on}} fantasies of {{escaping}} from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. The floating house is attached by a varying number between 10,000 and 20,000 balloons in the film's sequences. Up was Pixar's first film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D.|$|E

5|$|In late April 1917, Whittle <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> {{in a field}} {{hospital}} receiving treatment for psoriasis, before embarking for England on attachment to a training battalion. Joining the unit on 6 May, he once again underwent an eight-day furlough in a military hospital later in the month. During this time, Whittle attended an investiture ceremony in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace on 21 July, where he was decorated by King GeorgeV with his Victoria Cross and Distinguished Conduct Medal.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 1917, Peeler {{participated in}} the initial assault on Messines Ridge. Manning a Lewis Gun during the action, he was injured twice, {{suffering}} shrapnel wounds {{to his face and}} eye from an artillery shell, and a gunshot wound to his right cheek. He <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> in hospital before returning to his battalion. On 22 June, he was once again promoted to lance corporal. The 3rd Pioneer Battalion spent the next four months in a quieter section of the front.|$|E
5|$|Before each episode, Steel {{researches}} {{the history}} of the place in which he is going to perform. His research interests include local notable people, landmarks, customs and humorous anecdotes. The majority of the research sometimes took place close to the actual recording date. For example, Steel carried out almost no research for his episode in Walsall until ten days before the recording. In Merthyr Tydfil he <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> in the town, where he carried out research and met locals. He then performs a tailor-made show about the town in front of a local audience. The style of the programme is similar to other shows starring Steel, such as The Mark Steel Lectures, in which Steel presented a humorous lecture about a famous person in history.|$|E

One day a wind storm came and the tapestry flew away. Kam Tong, one of the children, would venture off to the dangerous Tibet mountains {{to try to get}} the tapestry back. Very few have ever survived the cave.|$|R
50|$|Nixon's final {{club was}} Sheffield Wednesday, {{for whom he}} signed on a free {{transfer}} on 1 July 2003, and where he {{was used as a}} goalkeeping coach, making one league appearance — on 27 September 2003 against Grimsby Town. His spell with the club was <b>spent</b> coaching <b>three</b> <b>days</b> a week, and spending two days back at Tranmere Rovers coaching.|$|R
5000|$|The Inner Tour by Raanan Alexandrowicz (2001). Mohsen (spelled Muhssein Abed Al Hamid in the credits) was one {{of three}} artists whose music is used {{throughout}} the documentary.

5|$|McCudden was {{determined}} his machine {{would remain in}} first-class fighting order. He <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> working with his fitters and armourers, stripping down the Vickers gun's synchronising gear, firing at the butts and making eight test flights shooting at ground targets. His armourers joked that his guns would never work in the air if he wore {{them out on the}} ground. He continued to experience jams and his unclaimed victim of 14 September 1917—Ernst Wiegand—was able to escape and crash-land wounded in German territory thanks to another stoppage. Since his crash was not witnessed his claim went uncredited.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for {{the launch}} resumed on 22 January, and the launch {{occurred}} successfully at 04:28:42 GMT on 24 January. Following the launch, Progress M1-5 <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> in free flight before docking with the rear port of the Kvant-1 module of Mir at 05:33:31 GMT on 27 January. The docking port {{had previously been}} occupied by Progress M-43, which departed at 05:19:49 on 25 January, and subsequently remained in orbit until Progress M1-5 had docked with Mir. Progress M-43, which had originally been launched to carry supplies and raise Mirs orbit, in anticipation of manned flights which were never launched, was subsequently deorbited at 02:12 GMT on 29 January, burning up during re-entry at 02:58.|$|E
5|$|After the Belgian Grand Prix on 2 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at various European race circuits between 4–7 September {{to prepare for}} the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari, Williams, BAR, Jordan and Minardi tested at the Mugello Circuit. Rubens Barrichello for Ferrari set the fastest times on the first and second days. The second day of testing was disrupted on six occasions after BAR test driver Takuma Sato went off the circuit, suffered an electronic control unit failure and had a malfunctioning anti-stall system. BAR driver Olivier Panis and Minardi driver Alex Yoong both had problems with their clutch and gearboxes. On the final day Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1 minute and 24.226 seconds, four-tenths ahead of Panis. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> at his team's private test track the Fiorano Circuit where he did practice starts as well as testing of launch control and traction control.|$|E

25|$|Although Tereshkova {{experienced}} {{nausea and}} physical discomfort {{for much of}} the flight, she orbited the earth 48 times and <b>spent</b> almost <b>three</b> <b>days</b> in space. With a single flight, she logged more flight time than the combined times of all American astronauts who had flown before that date. Tereshkova also maintained a flight log and took photographs of the horizon, which were later used to identify aerosol layers within the atmosphere.|$|R
5|$|Controversy {{regarding}} {{the identity of}} the filaments preserved in the first Sinosauropteryx specimen began almost immediately, as the team of scientists <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> in Beijing examining the specimen under a microscope. The results of their studies (reported during a press conference at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences on Thursday, April 24, 1997) were inconclusive; the team agreed that the structures preserved on Sinosauropteryx were not modern feathers, but suggested further research was required to discover their exact nature. Palaeontologist Alan Feduccia, who had not yet examined the specimen, wrote in Audubon Magazine that the structures of Sinosauropteryx (which he considered at the time to be a synonym of Compsognathus, as Compsognathus prima) were stiffening structures from a frill running along the back, and that dinosaur palaeontologists were engaging in wishful thinking when equating the structures with feathers. Subsequent publications saw some of the team members disagreeing over {{the identity of the}} structures.|$|E
5|$|Born Anna Louise Mohan, as a {{young girl}} she began using the last name of her stepfather, Sheridan Bryant, instead of her father's name. She grew up in rural Nevada and {{attended}} the University of Nevada in Reno and the University of Oregon in Eugene, graduating with a degree in history in 1909. Pursuing a career in journalism, she became society editor of the Spectator newspaper and freelanced for The Oregonian, both in Portland, Oregon. During her years in Portland (1909–1915), she became active in the women's suffrage movement. Leaving her first husband in 1915 to follow Reed to Greenwich Village, she formed friendships with leading feminists of the day, some of whom she met through Reed's associates at publications such as The Masses, or at meetings of a women's group, Heterodoxy, or through work with the Provincetown Players. During a National Woman's Party suffrage rally in Washington, D.C., in 1919, she was arrested and <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> in jail. Like Reed, she had lovers outside of marriage, and during her Greenwich Village years (1916–1920) these included playwright Eugene O'Neill and painter Andrew Dasburg.|$|E

60|$|December 9. Wellington. Ten {{hours from}} Wanganui by the Fly. December 12. It {{is a fine}} city and nobly situated. A busy place, and full of life and movement.

I suppose we shall not see such another one soon.|$|R
60|$|It hadn't done him any harm, {{that was}} the point. He had tested the doctor's {{statement}} and found it incorrect. He had <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> hectic <b>days</b> and nights in New York, and--after a reasonable interval--had felt {{much the same as}} usual. And since then he had imbibed each night, and nothing had happened. What it came to was that the doctor was a chump and a blighter. Simply that and nothing more.|$|R
5|$|Apollo 16 {{landed in}} the Descartes Highlands on April 20, 1972. The crew was {{commanded}} by John Young, with Ken Mattingly and Charles Duke. Young and Duke <b>spent</b> just under <b>three</b> <b>days</b> on the surface, {{with a total of}} over 20 hours EVA.|$|R

25|$|While Maitland and Boadicea {{were serving}} with the inshore {{squadron}} at Brest, Boadicea hit the Bas de Lis. This caused a large hole in her hull {{with the result}} that she started taking on water. Even the contribution of 100 seamen from other vessels, together with additional pumps, barely kept her afloat. A frigate escorted her to Portsmouth. Boadicea returned to her station within eight <b>days,</b> having <b>spent</b> only <b>three</b> <b>days</b> in dock undergoing repairs.|$|R
60|$|We <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> more <b>days</b> at that place. First it was {{necessary}} to allow time to elapse before the gases which generated in their great bodies caused those of the sea-cows which had been killed in the water, to float. Then they must be skinned and their thick hides cut into strips and pieces to be traded for sjamboks or to make small native shields for which some of the East Coast tribes will pay heavily.|$|R
25|$|New Westminster {{soon had}} an {{opportunity}} to be grateful to Captain Moore, when the bitterly cold winter of 1861-62 froze the Fraser River from Lulu Island to Hope and isolated New Westminster from December until March 12, when Moore used the Flying Dutchman paddlewheel first and <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> smashing a passage through the ice so supplies could be delivered to the little community.|$|E

Gorbachev <b>spent</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> (19, 20, and 21 August) under house arrest at his dacha in the Crimea before being freed and {{restored}} to power. However, upon his return, Gorbachev found that neither Union nor Russian power structures heeded his commands, as support had swung over to Yeltsin, whose defiance had led to the coup's collapse.|$|E
