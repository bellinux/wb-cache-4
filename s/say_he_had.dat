5|$|Despite the {{strained}} {{relationship between}} Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted {{to work together}} again on extending Medicare to cover prescription drug benefits. Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400billion program as an opportunity {{that should not be}} missed. However, when the final formulation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been betrayed by the Bush administration.|$|E

5|$|Reich {{lost his}} {{position}} at the New School in May 1941 after writing to its director, Alvin Johnson, to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> saved several lives in secret experiments with the accumulator. Johnson was aware of Reich's claims that he could cure cancer, and told him the New School was not an appropriate institution for the work. Reich was also evicted from Kessel Street after his neighbours complained about the animal experiments. His supporters, including Walter Briehl, gave him $14,000 to buy a house, and he settled into 9906 69th Avenue.|$|E
5|$|They {{argued that}} Bamber had then set about {{arranging}} {{the scene to}} make it appear that Sheila was the killer. He discovered that she could not have reached the trigger with the silencer attached, so he removed it and returned it to the gun cupboard, then placed a Bible next to her body to introduce a religious theme. He removed the kitchen phone from its hook, left the house via a kitchen window, perhaps after showering, and banged the window from the outside so that the catch dropped back into position. He had then cycled on his mother's bicycle. Shortly after 3am, he had telephoned Mugford, then the police at 3:26am to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> just received a frantic call from his father. To create a delay before the bodies were discovered, he had not called 999, had driven slowly to the farmhouse, and had told police that his sister was familiar with guns, so that they would be reluctant to enter.|$|E

25|$|Author and {{journalist}} Martin Dillon states Fenton fled to England from Northern Ireland {{of his own}} accord, based on {{an interview with a}} senior IRA member with access to details of Fenton's court-martial. Dillon states that Fenton was ordered to return to Northern Ireland by his handlers in Special Branch, and <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> gone to England to see a boxing match. According to the IRA, Special Branch knew Fenton faced execution if he returned and that he was deliberately sacrificed to preoccupy the IRA and divert suspicion from another informer operating within the IRA's Belfast Brigade.|$|E

Smith later admitted to having planted the drugs. They had been found in an unrelated case earlier that day. Prosecutors also accused Smith of calling Alex White after the shooting and telling the informant to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> bought crack cocaine at Johnston's house. According to court filings, before talking to the homicide detective, the three officers involved in the shooting got together to get their stories straight.|$|E
25|$|Umar was strong, fit, {{athletic}} and good at wrestling. He {{is said to}} have participated in the wrestling matches {{on the occasion of the}} annual fair of Ukaz. From first hand accounts of his physical appearance Umar is said to be vigorous, robust and a very tall man, in markets he would tower above the people. The front part of his head was bald, always A'sara Yusran (working with two hands), both his eyes were black, with yellow skin, however, ibn Sa'ad in his book stated that he never knew that 'Umar had yellow skin, except if the people took into criterion a certain part of his life where his color changed because he always ate oil at that part of his life. Others <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> reddish-white skin. His teeth were ashnabul asnan (very white shining). He would always color his beard and take care of his hair using a type of plant.|$|E
25|$|The family appealed, {{contrasting}} {{her case}} {{with that of}} Juan Lafuente, another possible victim whose petition the court's counterpart in Dutchess County, where he lived, had accepted. Like Philip, his exposure to the attacks is based on circumstantial evidence. He, too, had recently lost a job and struggled with depression, and as a volunteer fire marshal in Poughkeepsie might himself have had a reason to offer assistance at the attack site. His office was eight blocks north of the W.T.C. complex, but the court accepted testimony from someone who frequented the same local deli claiming he had overheard Lafuente <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{a meeting at the}} Trade Center that morning. Philip's family believes Lafuente's petition, with similarly minimal evidence of the alleged decedent's presence {{at the site of the}} attacks, was accepted primarily because his wife, Colette, was mayor of Poughkeepsie at the time and the case was heard there rather than in Manhattan.|$|E

25|$|The role of Vikki, Jake's second wife, had {{interest}} {{across the}} board, {{but it was}} Pesci who suggested actress Cathy Moriarty from a picture he once saw at a New Jersey disco. Both De Niro and Scorsese believed that Moriarty could portray the role after meeting with her on several occasions and noticing her husky voice and physical maturity. The duo had {{to prove to the}} Screen Actors Guild that she was right for the role when Cis Corman showed 10 comparing pictures of both Moriarty and the real Vikki LaMotta for proof she had a resemblance. Moriarty was then asked to take a screen test which she managed‚Äîpartly aided with some improvised lines from De Niro‚Äîafter some confusion wondering why the crew were filming her take. Joe Pesci also persuaded his former show-biz pal and co-star in The Death Collector, Frank Vincent, to try for the role of Salvy Batts. Following a successful audition and screen test, Vincent received the call to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> received the part.

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Britain and America {{was at a}} breaking point when Buddington salvaged Resolute. They were {{on the brink of}} their third war. President Franklin Pierce addressed Congress to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ceased to have diplomatic relations with Britain. He closed the British embassies and sent the ambassadors home. Tensions continued to mount. Suddenly one of the most vocal hawks, Senator James Murray Mason, from Virginia, proposed a bill in Congress for the government to buy Resolute, refurbish her, and sail her back to Britain as a present. The bill passed, authorizing more than $40,000 for the work, and President Pierce signed it into law. Resolute was sent to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where she underwent a complete refit, and Commander Henry Hartstene USN, sailed her back to Britain, arriving at Spithead on December 12, 1856. After Resolute was towed to Cowes so that the Queen and Prince Albert could tour her, Captain Harstene presented the ship to Queen Victoria as a gesture of peace and good-will on December 17, 1856. Soon the talk of war ceased, and the gift of Resolute was seen as instrumental in the easing of these tensions. Henry Grinnell, a New York merchant and ship owner who had grown up in New Bedford, had supported the purchase of Resolute to be used as the gift, and both he and Lady Franklin had hoped the Navy would use the ship for a new search for Sir John Franklin's expedition. However, by 1856 the Royal Navy was no longer willing to spend money on what they now believed would be a fruitless search. It was impossible to believe that any of the Franklin men could still be alive eleven years after they entered the Arctic. Belcher's abandonment of four seaworthy ships was the last straw. Nor was the Navy willing to let Lady Franklin use Resolute for a privately funded search. Britain could not risk losing Resolute after the important role the ship had played in smoothing the turbulent waters between her and America. Resolute stayed in home waters until she was taken to the breaker's dock at Chatham Dockyard in 1879.|$|E

[...] Tremaine paid one cent per word, which was higher than some of the competing magazines, but the publisher, H-K Publications, was unable to sustain the magazine while it gained circulation, and it was cancelled after less than a year when Tremaine resigned. [...] Comet published fiction by several well-known and popular writers, including E.E. Smith and Robert Moore Williams. [...] The young Isaac Asimov, visiting Tremaine in Comets offices, was alarmed when Tremaine asserted that anyone who gave stories to competing magazines for no pay should be blacklisted; Asimov promptly insisted that Donald Wollheim, to whom he had given a free story, should make him a token payment so he could <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been paid.|$|E
