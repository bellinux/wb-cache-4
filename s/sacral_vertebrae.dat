5|$|The {{vertebral}} column of Scelidosaurus contained {{at least six}} neck vertebrae, seventeen dorsal vertebrae, four <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae</b> and at least thirty-five tail vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} numbers are unknown, the {{vertebral}} column of Megalosaurus was probably divided into ten neck vertebrae, thirteen dorsal vertebrae, five <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae</b> and fifty to sixty tail vertebrae, as {{is common for}} basal Tetanurae.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a unique {{combination}} of traits not in themselves unique. The transverse processes, the side extensions, of the tail are present up to the twenty-eighth vertebra of the series. The transverse processes of the front tail vertebrae are rod-shaped with narrow bases and do not touch the plate formed by the fusion of the processes of the <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> The chevrons, bones pointing to below from the bottom side of the tail vertebrae, have {{the shape of an}} inverted T. The length of the ilium equals, or is greater than, that of the thighbone.|$|E
50|$|The {{preserved}} <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra</b> was not fused {{with its}} posterior neighbour, indicating that Gaviacetus was a tail-powered swimmer like Protocetus, better adapted to pursuit predation than Rodhocetus. The preserved transverse {{process of the}} <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra</b> is distally expanded, suggesting a synchondrosal joint between the vertebral column and pelvis.|$|R

5|$|In the {{original}} description, Hennig did not designate a holotype specimen. However, in a detailed monography on the osteology, systematic position and palaeobiology of Kentrosaurus in 1925, Hennig picked {{the most complete}} partial skeleton, today inventorised as MB.R.4800.1 through MB.R.4800.37, as a lectotype (see syntype). This material includes a nearly complete series of tail vertebrae, several vertebrae of the back, a sacrum with five <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae</b> and both ilia, both femora and an ulna, and {{is included in the}} mounted skeleton at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. The type locality is Kindope, Tanzania, near the Tendaguru hill.|$|E
5|$|Though {{perhaps the}} actual total of {{cervical}} vertebrae was {{as high as}} seven or eight, the neck was only moderately long. The torso was relatively flat in side view, however, despite the belly being broad, it was not extremely vertically compressed as with ankylosaurs but taller than wide. The last three dorsal vertebrae had no ribs. The spines of the <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae</b> touched each other but were not fused into a supraneural plate. The quickly tapering tail was relatively short, probably representing about half of body length. The tail chevrons were strongly inclined to the rear. The hip area and tail base were stiffened by large numbers of ossified tendons.|$|E
5|$|The Stonesfield Slate {{material}} {{contains no}} neck vertebrae; {{but a single}} broken anterior cervical vertebra is known from the New Park Quarry, specimen BMNH R9674. The breakage reveals large internal air chambers. The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatised, with large pleurocoels, pneumatic excavations, on its sides. The rear facet of the centrum is strongly concave. The neck ribs are short. The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly opisthocoelous, with convex front centrum facets and concave rear centrum facets. They are also deeply keeled, with the ridge on the underside representing about 50% of the total centrum height. The front dorsals perhaps have a pleurocoel above the diapophysis, the lower rib joint process. The rear dorsal vertebrae, according to Benson, are not pneumatised. They are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets. They have secondary joint processes, forming a hyposphene–hypantrum complex, the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross-section. The height of the dorsal spines of the rear dorsals is unknown, but a high spine on a tail vertebra of the New Park Quarry material, specimen BMNH R9677, suggests {{the presence of a}} crest on the hip area. The spines of the five vertebrae of the sacrum form a supraneural plate, fused at the top. The undersides of the <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are rounded but the second sacral is keeled; normally it is the third or fourth sacral having a ridge. The <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae</b> seem not to be pneumatised but have excavations at their sides. The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets on both the front and rear side. They have excavations at their sides and a longitudinal groove on the underside. The neural spines of the tail basis are transversely thin and tall, representing {{more than half of the}} total vertebral height.|$|E

5|$|All the {{vertebrae}} {{were highly}} pneumatised by invading air sacs, {{except for the}} atlas bone and the hindmost tail vertebrae, and were thereby connected to the respiratory system. The back vertebrae were as pneumatised as those of sauropod dinosaurs, and had an extensive system of depressions. These adaptations may be correlated with gigantism, as they reduce weight. The six vertebrae of the sacrum were also tall and pneumatised, and all but the first one were fused together at the top, their neural spines forming a neural plate. The ilium, the top hip bone, was also partially pneumatised close to the <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> Part of the pelvis was hypertrophied (enlarged) compared to other ornithomimosaurs, to support {{the weight of the}} animal with strong muscle attachments. The front hip bones tilted upwards in life. The tail of Deinocheirus ended in at least two fused vertebrae, which were described as similar to the pygostyle of oviraptorosaurian and therizinosauroid theropods. Ornithomimosaurs are known to have had pennaceous feathers, so this feature suggests that they might have had a fan of feathers at the tail end.|$|E
5|$|Head also {{demonstrated}} that the teeth of Eolambia were broader and more asymmetrical than Kirkland had assumed; {{he also noted that}} subadults only possessed two teeth per tooth position, unlike hadrosaurids, although adult specimens in fact have the three or more tooth positions as originally demonstrated by Kirkland. Head further showed that Eolambia possessed seven <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> unlike eight or more in derived hadrosaurids, and that its antitrochanter was actually more poorly developed than those of Ouranosaurus and Altirhinus. Examination of the OMNH specimens further demonstrated that that the postacetabular region of the ilium did not form a distinct process, and the articulations {{at the bottom of the}} femur are not very prominent, both of which separate Eolambia from more derived iguanodonts such as hadrosaurids. Thus, Head concluded that Eolambia was a basal member of the Hadrosauroidea, outside of the Hadrosauridae, a conclusion supported by a phylogenetic analysis finding it to be a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid closely related to Probactrosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The 19 dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar}} to the pectoral vertebrae, being weakly concave and taller than long, but the neural spines are proportionally taller than the centra. The single-headed dorsal ribs are rounded but slightly flattened in cross-section, and some have a prong-like projection at the top end; their articular surfaces are slightly concave. Underneath, there are at least ten pairs of gastralia, each of which tapers to the sides and has a central groove on the bottom surface. The three <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are similar, but have much smaller, blunter, more oval-shaped ribs. The comparatively smaller first sacral rib is directed further outwards and backwards than the other two ribs. There initially were 25 caudal vertebrae preserved, with 22 still being accounted for. The last several caudal vertebrae are partially fused into a pygostyle-like structure. The preserved caudal ribs are flattened, triangular, and taper towards the tip of the tail.|$|E
40|$|Background: In the lumbosacral region, {{anatomical}} variations {{occur with}} changes {{in the number of}} <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra</b> by deletion of first <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra</b> or by the union of fifth lumbar or first coccyx with sacrum. The fifth lumbar vertebra may be fused with the sacrum in the case of sacralisation, or the first <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra</b> may be fused with fifth lumbar vertebra in the case of lumbarisation. This may cause serious problems during spinal surgery if we may fail to recognise the lumbosacral transitional vertebra. Materials and methods: We studied 117 dry human sacra of South Indian population of known sex. Out of 117 sacra, 70 male and 47 female. The sacra with four vertebral segments were selected and studied its morphology. Its features were carefully examined and noted. Result: A typical sacrum consisting of five segments was observed in 103 (88. 03 %) specimen, while presence of lumbarisation was noted in 2 (1. 70 %) cases and sacralisation was noted in 12 (10. 25 %) cases. Sacrum with 3 pairs of sacral foramina is 1. 70 %. Among the 2 specimen, we got 1 male and 1 female respectively Conclusion: Present study shows that the lumbarisation of first <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra</b> leads to the formation of three pairs of sacral foramina, which is 1. 70 % in South Indian population. This awareness of lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV) will help to understand its importance during surgical procedures and also in reporting the radiographs such as X-rays, CT and MRI...|$|R

5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of A. atacis {{is a group}} of three connected dorsal vertebrae. Cervical vertebrae are uncommon from Bellevue {{and most of them are}} poorly preserved. The vertebrae are opisthocoelous, with centra that lengthen toward the rear. Neural spines have been preserved on the vertebrae, and they face toward the rear. Two dorsal vertebrae were preserved with a complete, but very crushed neural arch, a neural spine with a characteristic shape: it is very widened distally and narrows downwards. The vertebrae also have an internal structure that is spongy, with very large cells. The caudal vertebrae are all strongly procoelous and are compressed on the sides. The neural spines of the caudal vertebrae are very narrow and very tall and point toward the rear. The middle caudal vertebrae are more compressed on the sides that the others. Also, the centrum of middle caudal vertebrae is longer proportionally. Two <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae</b> were known from Bellevue. They are poorly preserved, and are thought to belong to a juvenile. A complete sacrum was also found in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The neck {{consisted}} of nine cervical vertebrae, {{which would have}} formed an S-shaped curve, {{as indicated by the}} shape of the vertebral bodies in the side view of the skeleton. The vertebral bodies of the anterior cervical vertebrae are shaped like a parallelogram, those of the middle are rectangular and those of the posterior show a trapezoid shape. The trunk was short, consisting of 12 dorsal and 6 fused <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> The tail was long compared to the body; although incompletely known, it probably {{consisted of}} 34 to 37 caudal vertebrae. The dorsal spine was stiffened by ossified tendons, beginning with the fourth dorsal vertebra. This feature is present in many other ornithischian dinosaurs and probably countered stress caused by bending forces acting on the spine during bipedal locomotion. In contrast to many other ornithischians, the tail of Heterodontosaurus lacked ossified tendons, and was therefore probably flexible. It had a long, narrow pelvis and a pubis which resembled those possessed by more advanced ornithischians.|$|E
5|$|A later 1994 {{study by}} Novas instead {{classified}} Herrerasaurus within Dinosauria, and strongly supported its position within Saurischia, as well a provided synapomorphies shared with Theropoda. Novas {{found that the}} primitive features of lacking a brevis fossa and having only two <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae</b> were simply reversals found in the genus. In 1996, Novas went further by supporting a theropod position for Herrerasaurus with a phylogenetic analysis, which placed it closer to Neotheropoda than Eoraptor or Sauropodomorpha. Langer (2004) mentioned that this hypothesis was widely accepted, but that more later authors instead preferred to place Herrerasaurus as well as Eoraptor basal to Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, a clade called Eusaurischia. Langer (2004) conducted a phylogenetic analysis, {{and found that it}} was much more likely that Herrerasaurus was a basal saurischian, than either a theropod or a non-dinosaurian. Langer's proposal was supported by multiple studies until the discovery of Tawa, when Nesbitt et al. conducted a more inclusive analysis, and the resulting cladogram placed Herrerasauridae basal to Eoraptor, but closer to Dilophosaurus than Sauropodomorpha. Unlike Nesbitt, Ezcurra (2010) conducted a phylogenetic analysis to place his new taxon Chromogisaurus, and found that Herrerasauridae was basal to Eusaurischia.|$|E

25|$|Unusually among basal sauropodomorphs, Xingxiulong {{has four}} <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> This is a trait {{typically}} seen in more derived sauropodomorphs, like Melanorosaurus, Leonerasaurus, Barapasaurus, and Shunosaurus. The {{first of these}} <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> the dorsosacral, is not very well-fused to the next sacral vertebra; neither is it entirely fused to the corresponding sacral rib on the transverse processes. Collectively, the dorsosacral and first pair of sacral ribs extend forward to contact the ilium. The second and third <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> the two primordial sacrals, {{are about the same}} length, and are well-fused to each other. Like other basal sauropodomorphs, the transverse processes of the third sacral vertebra project backwards and outwards. The same is true of the transverse process and sacral ribs for the fourth sacral vertebra, which contact the ilium again at the back. All of the neural spines are plate-like, like the last few dorsal vertebrae.|$|E
40|$|Congenital malformations such as lumbosacral {{transitional}} vertebrae and {{spina bifida}} occulta constitute unrare anomalies and could affect the symptomatology of low back pain.

25|$|Features of the {{skeleton}} indicate that Lystrosaurus moved with a semi-sprawling gait. The lower rear {{corner of the}} scapula (shoulder blade) was strongly ossified (built of strong bone), which suggests that movement of the scapula contributed to the stride length of the forelimbs and reduced the sideways flexing of the body. The five <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae</b> were massive but not fused {{to each other and}} to the pelvis, making the back more rigid and reducing sideways flexing while the animal was walking. Therapsids with fewer than five <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are thought to have had sprawling limbs, like those of modern lizards.
