40|$|Series {{compensation}} of transmission lines is an effectiveand cheap method {{of improving the}} power transmission systemperformance. Series capacitors virtually reduces the length ofthe line {{making it easier to}} keep all parts of the power systemrunning in synchronism and to maintain a constant voltage levelthroughout the system. In Sweden this technology has been inuse since almost 50 years. The possibility to improve the performance of the ACtransmission system utilizing power electronic equipment hasbeen discussed a lot since about ten years. Some newsemiconductor based concepts have been developed beside thesince long established HVDC and SVC technologies. The ThyristorControlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) is one such concept. Byvarying the inserted reactance an immediate and well-definedimpact on the active power flow in the transmission line isobtained. Several potential applications, specifically poweroscillation damping, benefit from this capability. The conceptimplied the requirement to design a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>valve,</b> whichcan be inserted directly in the high-voltage power circuit. This certainly presented a technical challenge but thestraightforward approach appeared to be a cost-effectivealternative with small losses. It was also realized that the TCSC exhibits quite differentbehaviour with respect to subsynchronous frequency componentsin the line current as compared to the fixed series capacitorbank. This was a very interesting aspect as the risk ofsubsynchronous resonance (SSR), which just involves such linecurrent components, has hampered the use of series compensationin power systems using thermal generating plants. The thesis deals with the modelling and control aspects ofTCSC. A simplifying concept, the equivalent, instantaneousvoltage reversal, is introduced to represent the action of thethyristor controlled inductive branch, which is connected inparallel with the series capacitor bank in the TCSC. The idealvoltage reversal is used in the thesis in order to describe andexplain the TCSC dynamics, to investigate its apparentimpedance at various frequencies, as a platform forsynthesizing the boost control system and as the base elementin deriving a linear, small-signal dynamical model of thethree-phase TCSC. Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) then hasbeen applied to the TCSC model in order to tune its boostregulator taking into account the typical variation ofparameters that exists in a power system. The impact of theboost control system with respect to damping of SSR is finallybeing briefly looked at.

40|$|The {{switching}} losses of power conversion {{systems can be}} significantly reduced by use of the proposed mutually commutated converter topologies which equipped with IGBT-based cycloconverters and permit soft switching of all <b>semiconductor</b> <b>valves</b> in all operating points without any auxiliary valves.

A simplified three phase power conversion system is studied in this thesis where the load side is represented by counter-emf. The aim of the thesis {{is to find a}} feasible way which allows the thyristor-based cycloconverter to be commutated at any instant of each modulation interval. With this purpose, the method should be able to overcome the inherit limitation of the thyristor, which is the lack of turn-off capability.

40|$|For voltage {{adaptation}} and galvanic isolation in High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) converter stations, standard transformers operating at grid frequency are currently used. These devices {{tend to be}} very large and heavy, which is undesirable in many applications. Transformers where the magnetic parts operate at a frequency considerably higher than the grid frequency could offer many advantages. Smaller and lighter transformers and lower losses are among them. In this thesis, a future-oriented HVDC converter station using a medium frequency MF transformer is studied with special focus on the converter circuits. The converter size used in this work is 78 MW (± 75 kVDC/ 11 kVAC) and the main application is power transmission to and from offshore installations. The converter consists of a snubbered Voltage-Source Converter VSC and 2 -phase by 3 -phase cycloconverter connected by a MF transformer. The VSC is implemented using a single phase leg and the cycloconverter is implemented using fast thyristors. It is expected that the semiconductor losses of the power conversion system will be significantly reduced by the use of the proposed converter topology which permits soft switching of all <b>semiconductor</b> <b>valves</b> in all operating points without any auxiliary valve. The thesis evaluates the commercial potential of the proposed HVDC system. A general circuit design based on available preconditions is made first for the studied converter station, and then a comparison with an existing two-level HVDC-Light station with regard to semiconductor requirements and losses is performed for the same operating point. The total space occupied by the valve installations for both systems is also estimated. The comparison shows that the proposed system promises a considerable {{reduction in the number of}} semiconductor devices and, as a result, the total volume of the converter <b>valves.</b> However, the <b>semiconductor</b> losses increase slightly...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{a compact}} and light primary {{switched}} conversion system for AC-fed railway propulsion is investigated. It {{is characterized by}} soft switching of all converter stages and a source commutated primary converter comprising series connected valves. Both weight and volume of the conversion system are reduced significantly compared to a conventional system with a low frequency transformer. The conversion system {{is made up of}} N isolated AC/DC conversion cells, each comprising a cycloconverter and a voltage source converter (VSC) coupled by a medium frequency transformer. The cells are series connected on the AC side and connected to a common DC-link. Thus, 2 N+ 1 voltage levels can be synthesized at the AC terminal and the voltage stress on the transformer and line filter is reduced compared to a one cell solution. Series connection of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>valves</b> allows independent choice of blocking voltage and number of converter cells. Choosing two converter cells is an attractive compromise. Five level output reduces the harmonic distortion and simplify transformer and line filter design while keeping the complexity of the conversion system low. The mutually commutated converter (MCC) allows a transformer frequency in the range of 4 to 8 kHz without derating the line side converter due to zero voltage switching of the VSC. Modern magnetic materials, like high silicon steel, amorphous and noncrystalline materials allow design of the transformer with high efficiency at elevated frequencies. In a 15 kV system, the peak voltage at the catenary is typically beyond 32 kV which is far beyond the voltage capability of currently available semiconductors. Therefore, several semiconductors are connected in series. Favourable commutation conditions and a new gate drive arrangement allow snubberless commutation of the primary converter stage. Thus, the primary converter can be highly integrated, reducing both weight and volume. The conversion system can be placed on the roof or in the underframe without compromising efficiency or vehicle performance. The feasibility of the conversion concept has been demonstrated by means of a down-scaled prototype. Snubberless commutation of series connected valves is demonstrated. QC 2010072...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, metal {{electrodeposition}} on semiconductor substrates is investigated. We {{show that}} electrodeposition of metals on n-type Si and Ge {{is an excellent}} method to create Schottky barriers and that this method {{has a number of}} unique advantages over other (physical) deposition methods. These advantages can be used to improve the prospects of applications in the area of Spintronics and Plasmonics. Firstly, the excellent current-voltage and capacitance-voltage characteristics of electrodeposited Schottky barriers indicate that they have an ideality factor close to unity and that the reverse bias leakage is orders of magnitude smaller than in evaporated Schottky barriers. These characteristics {{can be used to make}} highly doped Schottky barriers in which all reverse bias current is due to tunnelling. For magnetic metals, these Schottky barriers hence allow spin-conserved conduction which is a necessary step towards <b>semiconductor</b> spin <b>valves</b> and spin transistors. Secondly, electrodeposition is not a line-of-sight-technique and can hence be used to grow three dimensional structures when an appropriate pattern is created. Self assembly of latex spheres is shown to change both qualitative and quantitatively upon using a lithographically defined pattern. By using electrodeposition of gold around this latex sphere pattern nano-void array photonic crystals are created. We show that plasmonic modes are detectable in these arrays opening up the path to on-chip optical communication. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
