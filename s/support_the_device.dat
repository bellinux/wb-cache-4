40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper is our first step toward the develop- ment of an exoskeleton for human gait <b>support.</b> <b>The</b> <b>device</b> we foresee should be suitable for assisting walking in paralyzed subjects and should be based on myo- electrical muscular signals (EMGs) as a communication channel between the hu- man and the machine. This paper concentrates on the design of a biomechanical model of the human lower extremity. The system predicts subjects intentions from the analysis of his/her electromyographical activity. Our model takes into account three main factors. Firstly, the main muscles spanning the knee articulation. Sec- ondly, the gravity affecting the leg during its movement. Finally, it considers the limits within which the leg swings. Furthermore, it is capable of estimating several knee parameters such as joint moment, angular acceleration, angular velocity, and angular position. In order to have a visual feedback of the predicted movements we have implemented a three-dimensional graphical simulation of a human leg which moves in response to the commands computed by the model...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we present an {{experimental}} validation of different methods {{used in a}} passive indoor localization system for inferring occupancy information on different zones of interest. The experiments were conducted in a lecture building of 6, 000 squared meters with 20 classrooms for 6 months. In addition, the teaching computers were used as monitors in order to capture 802. 11 traffic. More than 200, 000 unique MAC addresses from heterogeneous devices with diverse hardware and software configurations were detected, generating signals with different RSS and temporal patterns. Taking into account the particularities of this experimental environment, this paper first presents a characterization of the passive monitoring system and then analyses different localization methods. Those methods use representations of the RSS measurements based on order vectors, which <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> heterogeneity without requiring special calibration, and distance metrics that are applied to a simple machine learning-based classifier {{in order to provide}} satisfying results for occupancy purposes.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{modeling}} and a first experimental characterization of a bridge-shaped doubly clamped nonlinear energy harvester. The doubly clamped beam at large deflection induces stretching strain in the layers {{in addition to}} the bending strain, which stiffens the beam as the beam deflects and transforms the dynamics to the nonlinear regime widening the frequency bandwidth. The sectional behavior of the bridge-beam has been studied through the Classical Lamination Theory (CLT) specifically modified to introduce the piezoelectric coupling and nonlinear Green-Lagrange strain tensor. A lumped parameter model has been built through separation of variables method, this results in coupled motion equations which include additional non-common terms originating from a correct analysis of piezoelectrics coupling in nonlinear strain context. The model has been validated through tests on a mesoscale prototype. The prototype consists of a Macro Fiber Composite (MFC, Smart-material) piezoelectric patch glued on a thin aluminum layer and a lead proof mass is attached at mid span. The beam is doubly clamped on an aluminum <b>support.</b> <b>The</b> <b>device</b> is tested in open circuit and the frequency response is measured at different acceleration amplitudes.

40|$|Microfluidics {{has emerged}} as a {{valuable}} tool for the high-resolution patterning of biological probes on solid supports. Yet, its widespread adoption as a universal biological immobilization tool is still limited by several technical challenges, particularly for the patterning of isolated spots using three-dimensional (3 D) channel networks. A key limitation arises from the difficulties to adapt the techniques and materials typically used in prototyping to low-cost mass-production. In this paper, we present the fabrication of thin thermoplastic elastomer membranes with microscopic through-holes using a hot-embossing process that is compatible with high-throughput manufacturing. The membranes provide the basis for the fabrication of highly integrated 3 D microfluidic devices with a footprint of only 1 7 1 cm 2. When placed on a solid <b>support,</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> allows for the immobilization of up to 96 different probes {{in the form of a}} 10 7 10 array comprising isolated spots of 50 7 50 3 ̆bcm 2. The design of the channel network is optimized using 3 D simulations based on the Lattice-Boltzmann method to promote capillary action as the sole force distributing the liquid in the device. Finally, we demonstrate the patterning of DNA and protein arrays on hard thermoplastic substrates yielding spots of excellent definition that prove to be highly specific in subsequent hybridization experiments.

40|$|Sampling {{the vast}} {{volumes of the}} ocean {{requires}} tools capable of observing from a distance while retaining detail necessary for biology and ecology, ideal for optical methods. Algorithms that work with existing SeaBED AUV imagery are developed, including habitat classification with bag-of-words models and multi-stage boosting for rock sh detection. Methods for extracting images of sh from videos of long-line operations are demonstrated. A prototype digital holographic imaging device is designed and tested for quantitative in situ microscale imaging. Theory to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is developed, including particle noise {{and the effects of}} motion. A Wigner-domain model provides optimal settings and optical limits for spherical and planar holographic references. Algorithms to extract the information from real-world digital holograms are created. Focus metrics are discussed, including a novel focus detector using local Zernike moments. Two methods for estimating lateral positions of objects in holograms without reconstruction are presented by extending a summation kernel to spherical references and using a local frequency signature from a Riesz transform. A new metric for quickly estimating object depths without reconstruction is proposed and tested. An example application, quantifying oil droplet size distributions in an underwater plume, demonstrates the efficacy of the prototype and algorithms. by Nicholas C. Loomis. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Ultra-compact is a {{valuable}} property in designs of assistive devices for people with Duchenne Muscle Dystrophy. Reducing the size of these medical devices will increase the cosmetic appearance. Current devices are large and stigmatizing {{in the eyes of}} the users. In other words, the users want a device to be small enough to be worn underneath the clothes, so it becomes unnoticeable. Additionally, they want the device to adjust the amount of assistance to the progression of their disease. The goals of this study are (1) to design an elbow joint for an unnoticeable eating assistive device meeting the growing demands of the users and (2) to evaluate this design based on performance indicators. In order to reach these goals, two evolving fields of study are brought together that have great potential to reduce the size of exoskeletons: smart materials and compliant rotational joints. This study presents the design of an ultra-compact actuated rotational joint that can be used in an eating assistive device. An antagonistic actuator is made from shape memory alloy muscle wires. It is able to carry an external load and to actuate to move to different positions. A compliant rotational joint is optimised to balance the weight of the arm. In addition, it is used to auto-align with the elbow joint. The device supports the user passively at an early stage of the disease. The passive support is increased as the disease progresses by increasing the amount of stacked leaf springs. When the muscles have deteriorated too much for full passive support, the antagonistic SMA actuator is added for active <b>support.</b> <b>The</b> <b>device</b> generates a stall torque of 7. 22 10 ^ 3 Nm/m^ 3 and produces a work density of $ 7. 70 10 ^ 3 J/m^ 3 based on isolating volumes and the efficiency of the whole system is 3. 9 %.
