That figure was surpassed in 2008, as Wogan's show held off a challenge from Radio 1 for listeners during the breakfast slot.

In BVD Company, Inc., Farmer {{and a majority}} of the board refused to order the reinstatement of striking workers who picketed peacefully when other, unidentified individuals committed strike-related violence. [...] There was no evidence of conspiracy, the union and striking workers had no control over those who committed violence, and no evidence existed that the strikers or union had instigated the violence. Nonetheless, the Farmer board held that it was the affirmative duty of the striking workers to discourage violence and disassociate themselves from it. The question, the majority said, was not whether the terminations were right or wrong, but whether the purposes of the NLRA (e.g., labor peace) would be achieved by restoring the workers to their jobs and awarding back pay. [...] Since the purpose of the Act could not be achieved, the NLRB had no power to order it.|$|E

She spent time as a <b>strike</b> <b>picket</b> and used the prominence of her voice as a member of an influential family and as a well-known actress to denounce the arrests and treatment of striking workers. It was a significant time in both the labor movement and women's movement, and the public's attention was caught by the concept of women picketing for their rights, and La Follette and other activists showed their support. In addition to picketing, La Follette gave a speech to the workers, went to court to testify on behalf of arrested workers and raised the issue of police brutality. Together with other society and college women, La Follette was part of what was referred to in this and other strikes as the [...] "mink brigade", women whose dress and social status would give police pause in arresting them.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, International Labour Standards have been cited {{increasingly}} as the authoritative, worldwide body of jurisprudence on workers ’ rights as human rights. Continuing the debate on what constitutes labor rights, the author contrasts the definition of workers ’ rights under international human rights standards with U. S. labor history’s notion of “pure and simple unionism, ” examining the boundaries of rights defined by international standards in a comparative historical context. The standards examined include workers ’ right to organize; coercive employer speech; access to employer premises; nonmajority representation; the right to <b>strike,</b> <b>picket,</b> and boycott; union security clauses; the scope of bargaining; government enforcement; and the legal doctrine of employer association rights. Aligning U. S. labor relations law with international human rights standards would in part be a social advancement, but significant aspects of the standards advocate pure and simple unionism more than the original National Labor Relations Act, raising questions about how labor movements should use international standards as advocacy tools and public policy goals...|$|E
