50|$|The shell {{objects or}} <b>shell</b> <b>folders</b> are {{defined in the}} Windows {{registry}} {{and can be used}} to implement a sort of symbolic link too. Like folder shortcuts, they are transparent to the Windows shell.|$|R
50|$|It shows shortcuts to servers {{that the}} user {{has been to}} before, which by default is placed in a folder called NetHood, found in the user's user profile. This default {{location}} can be changed by modifying the pair of NetHood registry entries found under the registry keys HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell <b>Folders</b> and HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User <b>Shell</b> <b>Folders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Windows XP {{introduced}} a new Start Menu, with shortcuts to shell locations {{on the right and}} a list of most frequently used applications on the left. It also grouped taskbar buttons from the same program if the taskbar got too crowded, and hid notification icons if they had not been used for a while. For the first time, Windows XP hid most of the <b>shell</b> <b>folders</b> from the desktop by default, leaving only the Recycle Bin (although the user could get them back if they desired). Windows XP also introduced numerous other shell enhancements.|$|R
50|$|On Microsoft Windows, {{a special}} folder is a folder which is {{presented}} to the user through an interface as an abstract concept instead of an absolute folder path. (The synonymous term <b>shell</b> <b>folder</b> is sometimes used instead.) Special folders {{make it possible for}} any application to ask the operating system where an appropriate location for certain kinds of files can be found, regardless of what version or language of Windows is being used.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1996, Netscape {{announced}} that the next release of its browser, codenamed [...] "Constellation", would completely integrate with Windows and add a new shell, codenamed [...] "HomePort", which would present the same files and shortcuts no matter which machine a user logged into. Microsoft started working on a similar Internet Explorer release, codenamed [...] "Nashville". Internet Explorer 4.0 was redesigned and resulted in two products: the standalone IE4 and Windows Desktop Update, which updated the shell with features such as Active Desktop, Active Channels, Web folders, desktop toolbars such as the Quick Launch bars, ability to minimize windows by clicking their button on the taskbar, HTML-based folder customization, single click launching, image thumbnails, folder infotips, web view in folders, Back and Forward navigation buttons, larger toolbar buttons with text labels, favorites, file attributes in Details view, and an address bar in Windows Explorer, among other features. It also introduced the My Documents <b>shell</b> <b>folder.</b>|$|E
40|$|MAGNET (MAny GeNE Trees) v 0. 1. 3 :deciduous_tree::deciduous_tree::deciduous_tree: This is MAGNET (MAny GeNE Trees) v 0. 1. 3. This release {{includes}} {{the first draft}} of a new utility 'phyNcharSumm. sh' for summarizing information about the number of characters across (SNP) loci processed in MAGNET, which is now located in the <b>shell</b> <b>folder</b> of the distribution. This software is under active development, so expect other minor fixes and improvements likely in coming days/weeks...|$|E
5000|$|Although Windows {{does not}} provide {{convenient}} tools to create it, Explorer supports a [...] "folder link" [...] or [...] "shell link folder": a folder with the system attribute set, containing a hidden [...] "desktop.ini" [...] (folder customization) file which tells Explorer to look in that same folder for a [...] "target.lnk" [...] shortcut file pointing to another folder. When viewed in Explorer, the <b>shell</b> link <b>folder</b> then appears to have {{the contents of the}} target folder in itâ€”that is, the customized folder becomes the effective shortcut. This technique is used by Microsoft Windows for items like WebDAV folders. The advent of file system links in Windows Vista and up has made <b>shell</b> link <b>folders</b> less useful.|$|R
5000|$|The {{successor}} to Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0 introduced the user interface of Windows 95 to the Windows NT family, including the Windows shell, File Explorer (known as Windows NT Explorer at the time), {{and the use}} of [...] "My" [...] nomenclature for <b>shell</b> <b>folders</b> (e.g. My Computer). It also includes most components introduced with Windows 95. Internally, Windows NT 4.0 was known as the Shell Update Release (SUR). While many administrative tools, notably User Manager for Domains, Server Manager and Domain Name Service Manager still used the old graphical user interfaces, the Start menu in Windows NT 4.0 separated the per-user shortcuts and folders from the shared shortcuts and folders by a separator line. Windows NT 4.0 includes some enhancements from Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 such as the Space Cadet pinball table, font smoothing, showing window contents while dragging, high-color icons and stretching the wallpaper to fit the screen. Windows Desktop Update could also be installed on Windows NT 4.0 to update the shell version and install Task Scheduler. Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit included the Desktop Themes utility.|$|R
2500|$|Build 4015 (build date of March 28, 2003) {{was leaked}} to the Internet on April 28, 2003. A number of {{features}} Microsoft {{had been working on}} were rolled into this build, such as a range of parental controls, also moved and enlarged the Windows logo to {{the left side of the}} Start button a lot of additional configurability for the sidebar (including being able to put it below the start bar at the bottom of the screen), and the notion of [...] "Libraries" [...] (later known as virtual folders) of files. These libraries collected content from around the hard drive. The user could then filter this content and save it in a folder. Microsoft had originally intended to replace all special <b>shell</b> <b>folders</b> (My Documents, My Music, etc.) with virtual folders. However, this change was deemed too drastic and was dropped after Beta 1's release in mid-2005. Libraries were later included in Windows 7. This build was also notable for the debut of the boot screen progress bar that is seen in the final release (though 4015's version was blue, not green). A new Download Manager shell location suggested that Internet Explorer would get a Mozilla-style download manager, though no such functionality was apparent. Significant memory leak problems with Windows Explorer and the Sidebar made this build difficult to use, which resulted in some third-party hacks to mitigate the problem. The back-end database of Outlook Express changed completely, and became dependent on WinFS to store its email. WinFS itself still had significant performance and memory usage issues, and so it became common for testers to disable WinFS entirely, thus rendering Outlook Express inoperative.|$|R
