5|$|John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416) was Charles VI's {{uncle and}} a {{powerful}} figure in the kingdom, {{as well as the}} most famous and extravagant collector and commissioner of art of his day. He is still best known for commissioning the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, the famous International Gothic illuminated manuscript, and also commissioned the Holy Thorn Reliquary, now in the British Museum. The young king Charles had been forced to remove his uncle from governorships after the latter's rapacious conduct had led to unrest, and the meeting in 1391 marked their reconciliation after a period of bad relations. Lavish gifts among the Valois court circle were routine, and on this occasion Berry had <b>special</b> <b>reason</b> to be generous.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, a {{young and}} {{depleted}} Leeds United side, managed by David O'Leary, eliminated 1860 Munich from the Champions League beating them home and away in the preliminary round before reaching the semi-final. There were also famous wins by Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa in European Cup semifinals or finals. These were against the likes of Borussia Mönchengladbach, 1. FC Köln, Hamburg and FC Bayern Munich. Liverpool's win against Borussia Mönchengladbach in Rome stands out for one <b>special</b> <b>reason.</b> It started a sequence of six consecutive English European Cup victories each time involving the elimination of a German club in the latter stages.|$|E
25|$|The opening match {{matched the}} tecnico team of Molotov, Starman and Tigre Blanco (who do not {{regularly}} team up) face off against Los Guerreros Tuareg (Arkangel de la Muerte and Skándalo) and Nosferatu (who have teamed up on multiple occasions). The Rudo team proved victorious on the night, winning two falls to one. In the second match the Japanese team La Fiebre Amarilla ("The Yellow Fever") of Namajague and Okumura {{teamed up with}} Misterioso Jr. {{to take on the}} young high-flying trio of Diamante, Fuego and Tritón. During the match Delta landed awkwardly after executing a high risk move and had to be removed from the ring on a stretcher, fearing a serious injury. Fuego would pin Misterioso Jr. to win the third fall, which along with a victory in the first fall gave Fuego and his team the victory. CMLL normally includes a Lighting Match on their Super Viernes show unless they have a <b>special</b> <b>reason</b> to leave it out, and the August 3 edition did indeed feature a Lightning Match, pitting the Rudo veteran against the young, high-flying tecnico Stuka Jr.. The two wrestled a very fast paced match which ultimately saw El Felino pin Stuka Jr. before the time limit expired.|$|E
25|$|It {{was said}} that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that there was this, that, and the other <b>special</b> <b>reason</b> why {{it would be all}} moonshine in Nottingham. It was said again that the uneven roads would necessitate the {{employment}} of too many extra horses to make the company pay; but these prognosticators did not know that uneven roads create traffic; that people are ever ready to jump into a car, and even pay a full fare to simply ride {{to the top of a}} hill. Now it happens that these prophets are without honour in their native land. The tramways company is a great success in the town, as we shall see very soon. The first section was opened on September the 18th last year, the running being to and from the Railway Stations, the Trent Bridge , and St. Peter's Church. On that first day 2,277 persons were carried in four inside cars, which were worked by 27 horse, the fare being twopence all the way. But here is something rather good. In the week ending October the 5th (Goose Fair week mind) no fewer than 32,619 persons were carried in five cars; and this result was said by experienced men to be unparalleled in the history of tramways.|$|E

Those three songs have never been played live by the band. As of 2016, “Pea” and “Aeroplane” are the only songs from One Hot Minute that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have played in full since Dave Navarro left the band. The band however did tease [...] "My Friends", “Let's Make Evil” and [...] "Walkabout" [...] during the I'm With You World Tour. Chad Smith was asked by fans during a February 2014 online {{interview}} about the band's reasons behind not performing the songs and he responded by saying [...] "We don't really feel that connected to that record anymore. No <b>special</b> <b>reason,</b> not to say we would never play those songs but we don't feel that emotionally connected to that music right now." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{conditions}} for {{leave to appeal}} are laid out in Section 1(4). No conditions attach to an appeal where all parties consent, but when {{the permission of the}} High Court is sought, the judge may only grant leave if he [...] "considers that...the question of law concerned could substantially affect the rights of one or more parties to the arbitration agreement". Under Sections 1(5) and 1(6), the High Court may ask for additional reasons as to why the arbitrator reached the decision that he did, but only if one of the parties gave notice to the arbitrator that reasons would be required, or there was [...] "some <b>special</b> <b>reason</b> why such a notice was not given". In Universal Petroleum Co v Handels und Transport GmbH, the Court of Appeal interpreted the meaning of Sections 1(4) and 1(5). The dispute came from a highly detailed [...] "Schedule of Further Reasons" [...] ordered by the High Court because the judge felt that there was an ambiguous element in the reasons given. The appellate judges found that Section 1(5) required judges to order further reasons only to deal with points of law arising from the award. Material ambiguity was [...] "inadmissible and irrelevant for the purpose of the exercise of any jurisdiction under section 1 of the Act".|$|E

2500|$|The {{personal}} {{mythology of}} Luceafărul is overall a poetic rendition {{of a personal}} philosophy of love. Caracostea proposes that Eminescu had <b>special</b> <b>reason</b> {{to dwell on the}} poem, which must therefore express [...] "a fundamental experience". This is not the case for other ideas he borrowed from Kunisch, which merely resulted in conventional pieces such as [...] "Miron and The Disembodied Beauty". The [...] "allegorical meaning" [...] is explained by Eminescu's own comment: [...] " [...] is immortal, but lacks good fortune." [...] The result, according to scholar Geo Vasile, is Eminescu's [...] "triumph in the world of ideas": [...] "Here, the Albatross-poet extends his wings in all their magnificent reach." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Akiva, laws may be deduced {{from the}} {{juxtaposition}} of two legal sections, since [...] "every passage which stands close to another must be explained and interpreted with reference to its neighbor" [...] (כל פרשה שהיא סמוכה לחבירתה למדה הימנה; Sifre, Num. 131). According to Ishmael, on the contrary, nothing may be inferred from {{the position of the}} individual sections, since {{it is not at all}} certain that every single portion now stands in its proper place. Many a paragraph which forms, strictly speaking, the beginning of a book and should stand in that position, has been transposed to the middle. Ishmael explains the occurrence of a section in a place where it does not properly belong (ולמה נכתב כאן) by declaring that [...] "there is no first or last in the Scriptures" [...] (אלא מפני שאין מקדם ומאחר בתורה), not as due to any <b>special</b> <b>reason</b> (Mekhilta, ed. Weiss, p.48a; Ecclesiastes Rabbah i.; comp. Pesahim 6b, where Rav Papa defines this principle in such a manner that it does not contradict Ishmael's rules concerning [...] "Kelal uferat"). Eliezer ben Jose expanded this rule in his baraita (Baraita on the Thirty-two Rules) and divided it into two parts (Nos. 31 and 32).|$|E
40|$|Joseph Raz has {{developed}} a concept of authority based on the <b>special</b> relationship between <b>reasons</b> and action. While the view is very complex and subtle, it {{can be summed up}} by saying that authorities are authorities insofar as they can mediate between the reasons that happen to bind their subjects and the subjects’ actions. Authorities do this by providing <b>special</b> <b>reasons</b> via directives to their subjects. These <b>special</b> <b>reasons</b> are what Raz calls “protected reasons. ” Protected reasons are both first-order reasons for action and second-order “exclusionary reasons” that exclude the subject from considering some reasons in the balance of reasons for or against any action. I first make clear what Raz’s view of authority is, and I then defend this view from some contemporary critics...|$|R

40|$|Stone {{walls in}} {{agricultural}} land are {{incorporated in the}} general protection of biotopes. They are protected because they provide a habitat for endangered species. Therefore {{it is illegal to}} carry out proceedings in an area that is included in the protection of biotopes. In order to do that, exemption is needed which can only be granted if there are <b>special</b> <b>reasons.</b> The essay stipulates what these <b>special</b> <b>reasons</b> are. In an exemption errand the interest for nature conservation must be weighed against a public or a private interest. Administrators have varying opinions on how the interest for nature conservation, contra individual and public interests shall be evaluated. The interest for nature conservation has a lower value if the wall lacks endangered species or if stone walls are common in the area. But a lower value, in itself, can never be considered as <b>special</b> <b>reasons.</b> When it comes to a public interest, it must be an important one in order to bring about an exemption. Examples of important public interests are animal and health protection. Private interests are often constituted by the desire to improve the farming profitability. This is however rarely considered as an “unforeseen situation”, and therefore - according to preparatory work - it is not judged as <b>special</b> <b>reasons.</b> One conclusion is that the County Administrative Boards need improved guidance. Another conclusion is that exemption shall be used restrictively. Exemptions are not supposed to solve all problems due to protection of stone walls in agricultural land. They ought to be the solution when no other reasonable alternatives can be found...|$|R
