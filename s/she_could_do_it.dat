500|$|In 2016, Minaj stated she {{has learned}} {{the ins and outs}} of {{business}} so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> herself. In the same year, she launched her new fragrance [...] "Trini Girl".|$|E
2500|$|De Hidalgo later {{recalled}} Callas as [...] "a phenomenon... She {{would listen to}} all my students, sopranos, mezzos, tenors... <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all." [...] Callas herself {{said that she would}} go to [...] "the conservatoire at 10 in the morning and leave with the last pupil... devouring music" [...] for 10 hours a day. When asked by her teacher why she did this, her answer was that even [...] "with the least talented pupil, he can teach you something that you, the most talented, {{might not be able to}} do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know how}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> or why she cared {{for such a}} miserable scamp, {{breaking}} her heart all this time!' he exclaimed.|$|E
60|$|Agatha's {{heart beat}} fast. It {{would have been}} a relief to assure herself that she was as fond of Gregory as she had been, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Beatrice {{pretended not}} to hear, and {{reflected}} a moment. He would go away and she would see him no more. <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> let slip this last hour? Oh, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{would not}} {{submit to the}} rite {{when it came to}} the point. The water looked so cold and dark and fearful, she said, that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> to save her life.' ...|$|R
60|$|She done it, too; and {{she done}} it {{beautiful}}. She done it so beautiful {{it was good}} to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again.|$|E
60|$|Sheer amazement kept me silent: I {{let him go}} on. He was a mere {{child in}} the hands of Mrs. Tenbruggen: she had only to {{determine}} to make a fool of him, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was no preaching in Carlisle that day, and Sunday School was {{not till}} the evening. Cecily got out her Lesson Slip {{and studied the}} lesson conscientiously. The rest of us did not see how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> We could not, that was very certain.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{felt her}} heart beating unpleasantly fast. It {{would have been a}} relief to assure herself that she was as fond of Gregory as she had been, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was so hard}} {{to answer}} that! Yet Rose knew she must, for Aunt Jane had {{declared}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and Uncle Mac had begged her to break the truth to the poor lad.|$|R
60|$|She {{would have}} <b>done</b> <b>it</b> {{as far as}} the sheets were concerned, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> as {{regarded}} her aunt. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> put herself into unison with the crumpled soiled linen, but not with the hard woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "But her swimming. Physically, she was {{the perfect}} woman--you know what I mean, not in the gross, muscular way of acrobats, but in all the {{delicacy}} of line and fragility of frame and texture. And combined with this, strength. How <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> was the marvel. You know the wonder of a woman's arm--the fore arm, I mean; the sweet fading away from rounded biceps and hint of muscle, down through small elbow and firm soft swell to the wrist, small, unthinkably small and round and strong. This was hers. And yet, to see her swimming the sharp quick English overhand stroke, and getting somewhere with it, too, was--well, I understand anatomy and athletics and such things, {{and yet it was}} a mystery to me how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|But how? A message sent by Saucelito and the {{steamboat}} to San Francisco--the usual way--would {{not reach}} them tonight. To go herself, rowing directly across in the dingey, {{would be the}} only security of success. If <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> It was a long pull--the sea was getting up--but she would try.|$|E
60|$|Winifred smiled. They {{would all}} plunge about with {{suggestions}} {{of this and}} that, but she knew already what she would be doing, and that was--nothing. The feeling that, after all, she had won a sort of victory, retained her property, was every moment gaining ground in her. No! {{if she wanted to}} punish him, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> at home without the world knowing.|$|E
60|$|There were {{plans to}} perfect; innumerable things to remember; {{a car and}} accessories, horses, saddles, outfits to buy. Carley knew she should sit down at her table and write and figure, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> then.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was a woman}} once, Victor," [...] he said, [...] "who nearly made {{mincemeat}} of my life. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> if <b>she</b> liked--and she wasn't {{the sort}} who spares. She died--thank God! You see I know something about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, Alick, it {{was much}} more {{convenient}} to her than if she had had to send about to horse-dealers or to advertise. I doubt if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> at all; and it is for her asylum, you know." ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{hand went}} {{out over the}} {{revolver}} toward his hand, as {{she pointed to the}} tell-tale yellow stain on his fingers. At the same time her eyes measured the nearness of her own hand and of his to the weapon. She ached to grip it in one swift movement. She was sure <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and yet she was not sure; {{and so it was that}} she refrained as she withdrew her hand.|$|E
6000|$|Rilla {{scanned the}} sky also; {{she did not}} like its appearance; a heavy {{thundercloud}} was appearing in the northwest. What in the world was to be done? There was no other train that night, since the nine o'clock special ran only on Saturdays. Would it be possible for them to reach Hannah Brewster's house, two miles away, before the storm broke? Rilla thought <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> alone easily enough, but with Jims it was another matter. Were his little legs good for it? ...|$|E
60|$|Aunt Pen {{did not say}} much, {{but made}} her mend and finish her patch and {{add it to the}} pile. After she went to bed that night Patty thought of it, and wished <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> over, it looked so badly. But as it could not be, she had a {{penitent}} fit, and resolved to keep her temper while she sewed, at any rate, for mamma was to see the little quilt when it was done, and would want to know all about it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Much more {{smoothly}} than a live horse,' Alice said, {{with a little}} scream of laughter, {{in spite of all}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to prevent <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> yet. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not die {{until she}} had once more seen his face, {{even though he did}} not see hers. No, not to-night would she seek this swift solution. She had words to say--or words to write--before the end. Already they rushed in upon her mind! ...|$|R
60|$|Alas for her resolve! <b>She</b> felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Not for worlds now <b>could</b> <b>she</b> give a hint {{about her}} misery to him, much less ask him plainly for {{information}} on the cause of Fanny's death. She must suspect, and guess, and chafe, and bear it all alone.|$|R
60|$|As {{they still}} walked and talked, the thought came to Dora, {{and it was}} a very {{pleasing}} one, that she might act another part with this young gentleman; she had played the cook, now for a while she could play the mistress, and she knew <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> so gently and so wisely that he would like it without perceiving it. She turned away her face for a moment; she felt that her pleasure in acting the part of mistress of Cobhurst, even for a little time, was flushing it.|$|E
60|$|She {{found herself}} {{planning}} the regeneration of those difficult and disputed hostels, plans {{that were all}} coloured by the sun and sky of Italy. The manacles had gone; her hands were free. She would make this her supreme occupation. She had learnt her lesson now she felt, she knew something of the mingling of control and affectionate regard that was needed to weld the warring uneasy units of her new community. And <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> now as she was and unencumbered, she knew this power was in her. When everything seemed lost to her, suddenly it was all back in her hands....|$|E
60|$|What {{it seemed}} to me was, that the ship would try to lie down and go to sleep on her right side; and then, before she had given that {{position}} a fair trial, would suddenly change her mind, and think <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> better on her left. At the moment the man came up to me she was trying to stand on her head; and before he had finished speaking she had given up this attempt, in which, however, she had very nearly succeeded, and had, apparently, decided to now play at getting out of the water altogether.|$|E
60|$|How was she to {{give him}} the purse? It was burning a hole in her pocket till <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so; and yet how was she {{to get it out of}} her {{possession}} into his, and make her little speech, here in the public garden? <b>She</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> easily enough at home in the drawing-room at Surbiton Cottage.|$|R
50|$|The {{night before}} the {{inspection}} Karin and her colleague Bror sneak away to visit a nightclub in Copenhagen. There, Karin suddenly, when she hears the nightclub singer sing, on a whim wants to see if <b>she</b> possibly <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> better? <b>She</b> gets herself up on stage and starts to sing. And is greeted by cheers and standing ovations.|$|R
60|$|And {{she played}} on, {{because of her}} {{disappointment}} persisting even the more in her play. She dreaded work, because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> as he <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> She was conscious of the great breach between them. She knew she had no power. The grown-up power to work deliberately was a mystery to her.|$|R
60|$|So she thought, {{and so she}} dreamed; {{and then}} the morning came, {{and she had to}} go down to her aunt. She ate her breakfast almost in silence, having {{resolved}} that she would tell her story the moment breakfast was over. She had, over night, and while she was in bed, studiously endeavoured not to con any mode of telling it. Up to the moment at which she rose her happiness was, if possible, to be untroubled. But while she dressed herself, she endeavoured to arrange her plans. She at last {{came to the conclusion that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> best without any plan.|$|E
60|$|It {{was clear}} to Lady Mabel {{that there was no}} {{opportunity}} now for any scheme. Whatever might be possible must be postponed till after this Cornish business had been completed. Perhaps it might be better so. She had thought that she would appeal to himself, that she would tell him of his father's wishes, of her love for him,--of the authority which he had once given her for loving him,--and of the absolute impossibility of his marriage with the American. She thought that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> if not efficiently at any rate effectively. But it could not be done on the very day on which the American had gone.|$|E
6000|$|Robin {{shook his}} head. [...] "Not likely," [...] said he. [...] "The child didn't {{use to make}} mocassins. I'm not sure if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> at all; besides she was last heard of miles and miles away from here in another direction. No, no, Walter lad, we mustn't let foolish fancies bother us. However, the sight o' this has fixed me to push on to-morrow as hard as I can lay my legs to it, for if Wapaw's alive we can't fail to come up wi' him afore sundown; and I'm keen to turn about an' go after my children. I'll push on by myself if ye don't care to keep up wi me." ...|$|E
60|$|She, however, {{told him}} nothing {{of her own}} life. There had come moments {{in which she was}} sorely tempted. But she had allowed them to pass by, telling herself on each {{occasion}} that this at any rate was not the moment. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> now,--or now,--or now, lest there should seem to be some peculiar motive on her own part. And so the matter went on till there had arisen a feeling of free confidence on the one side, and of absolute restraint on the other. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>she</b> said to herself. Much as she trusted Mr. Western, deeply as she regarded him as her friend, strongly as she wished that the story had been told to him at some former passage of their intimacy, the proper time had passed by, she said, and he must be left in his ignorance.|$|R
60|$|Margery was now excited. The daring of {{the wretched}} Jim in {{bursting}} into scarlet amazed {{her as much}} as his doubtful acquaintanceship with the demonstrative Mrs. Peach. To go to that Review, to watch the pair, to eclipse Mrs. Peach in brilliancy, to meet and pass them in withering contempt--if <b>she</b> only <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it!</b> But, alas! <b>she</b> was a forsaken woman.|$|R
60|$|And she did {{try that}} night and all the next day, {{thinking}} that if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> so make up her mind she would declare her purpose to Lady Ushant before she left Cheltenham. But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and in the struggle with herself at last she learned something of the truth. Lady Ushant saw nothing but what was right and proper in a marriage with Lawrence Twentyman, but Reginald Morton had declared it to be improper, and therefore {{it was out of}} her reach. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not bring herself, after what he had said, to look him in the face and tell him {{that she was going to}} become the wife of Larry Twentyman. Then she asked herself the fatal question;--was she in love with Reginald Morton? I do not think that she answered it in the affirmative, but she became more and more sure that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never marry Larry Twentyman.|$|R
