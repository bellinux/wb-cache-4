5|$|Although the {{scientific}} discipline of astronomy has made tremendous <b>strides</b> <b>in</b> understanding {{the nature of}} the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.|$|E
5|$|On July 15, 2014, Nowitzki re-signed {{with the}} Mavericks to a {{reported}} three-year, $25 million contract. He was also reunited with former championship teammate Tyson Chandler, who {{was traded to}} Dallas after a 3-year stint with New York. Also to come over from New York was point guard Raymond Felton. The Mavericks made big <b>strides</b> <b>in</b> the off-season to put Dirk with some considerable talent, signing a rising small forward Chandler Parsons and veteran point guard Jameer Nelson. The Mavericks later signed former championship teammate J. J. Barea after the Timberwolves waived him.|$|E
5|$|The city's skyline {{changed in}} the 1960s and 1970s with the {{construction}} of office towers around the Empire State Plaza and at the uptown campus of SUNY Albany, mainly under the direction of Governor Nelson Rockefeller. While Albany experienced a decline in its population due to urban sprawl and suburbanization, many of its historic neighborhoods were saved from destruction through the policies of Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd, the longest-serving mayor of any city in the United States. In the early 21st century, Albany has experienced growth in the high-technology industry, with great <b>strides</b> <b>in</b> the nanotechnology sector.|$|E

5|$|STRAT-X, or Strategic-Experimental, was a U.S. government-sponsored study {{conducted}} during 1966 and 1967 that comprehensively analyzed the potential {{future of the}} U.S. nuclear deterrent force. At the time, the Soviet Union was making significant <b>strides</b> <b>in</b> nuclear weapons delivery, and also constructing anti-ballistic missile defenses to protect strategic facilities. To address a potential technological {{gap between the two}} superpowers, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara entrusted the classified STRAT-X study to the Institute for Defense Analyses, which compiled a twenty-volume report in nine months. The report looked into more than one hundred different weapons systems, ultimately resulting in the MGM-134 Midgetman and LGM-118 Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles, the s, and the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles, among others. Journalists have regarded STRAT-X as a major influence on the course of U.S. nuclear policy.|$|E
5|$|Some herons, such as {{the black}} heron, adopt an unusual {{position}} while hunting for prey. With their head held down in a hunting position, they sweep their wings forward to meet {{in front of their}} head, thereby forming an umbrella shaped canopy. The primaries and secondaries touch the water, the nape feathers are erected and the tail is drooped, thereby ensuring the canopy is totally enclosed. The bird may take several <b>strides</b> <b>in</b> this position. One theory about the function of this behaviour is that it reduces glare from the water surface, allowing the bird to more easily locate and catch prey. Alternatively, the shade provided by the canopy may attract fish making their capture easier. Some herons adopt a similar behaviour called double-wing feeding in which the wings are swept forward to create an area of shade, though a canopy is not formed.|$|E
5|$|The {{emerging}} {{discipline of}} geology also brought {{natural history and}} natural philosophy closer together; {{the establishment of the}} stratigraphic column linked the spatial distribution of organisms to their temporal distribution, a key precursor to concepts of evolution. Georges Cuvier and others made great <b>strides</b> <b>in</b> comparative anatomy and paleontology in the late 1790s and early 19th century. In a series of lectures and papers that made detailed comparisons between living mammals and fossil remains Cuvier was able to establish that the fossils were remains of species that had become extinct—rather than being remains of species still alive elsewhere in the world, as had been widely believed. Fossils discovered and described by Gideon Mantell, William Buckland, Mary Anning, and Richard Owen among others helped establish that there had been an 'age of reptiles' that had preceded even the prehistoric mammals. These discoveries captured the public imagination and focused attention on the history of life on earth. Most of these geologists held to catastrophism, but Charles Lyell's influential Principles of Geology (1830) popularised Hutton's uniformitarianism, a theory that explained the geological past and present on equal terms.|$|E

5|$|When Deep Purple's first line-up came {{together}} in 1967, {{there was a moment}} of transition for the British music scene. Beat was still popular, especially in dance halls and outside the capital, but the tastes of young people buying records and filling up the clubs was rapidly changing in favour of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock. New bands like The Moody Blues, Procol Harum, and The Nice were pioneers in combining classical music with rock, using complex and daring arrangements. At the same time, psychedelia was making <b>strides</b> <b>in</b> the hedonistic swinging London society, where bands like Pink Floyd, The Pretty Things, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Traffic and Cream experimented with different forms of drug-induced rock music, in line with the hippie subculture coming from the USA. Many well-known acts, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who, were influenced by the changing feel and added many elements of progressive and psychedelic rock to their albums of that period.|$|E
