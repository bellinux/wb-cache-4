50|$|During the day, the draughtsboard shark is {{lethargic}} {{and typically}} hides inside crevices or caves on the reef. At night, it emerges to forage for food over nearby sandy flats. This shark consumes {{a wide variety}} of fishes and invertebrates, including spiny dogfish, cod, <b>sand</b> <b>perch,</b> blennies, octopus, squid, gastropods, innkeeper worms, krill, hermit crabs, crabs, spiny lobsters, and even sea squirts. Individuals have been observed sucking innkeeper worms out of their burrows, and swimming around with the antennae of large lobsters sticking out of their mouths for hours. A known parasite of this species is the tapeworm Calyptrobothrium chalarosomum.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{emphasis}} on ecosystem approaches to fisheries management renews interest in, {{and the need}} for, trophic information about fish communities. A program was started in 1980 at the National Marine Fisheries Service Galveston Laboratory to develop a trophic database for continental shelf fishes. Collections were made during 1982 - 1983 that were processed but never published, yet the data remain valid today for historical purposes and for delimiting food web components within ecosystem assessments. I examined spring, summer, and fall foods in offshore populations of nine common species of trawl-susceptible fishes, with particular reference to predation on commercial penaeid shrimps (Farfantepenaeus and Litopenaeus). Diets were evaluated with the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) which combines the occurrence, number, and weight of each food item. Bank sea bass (Centropristis ocyurus) and bighead searobin (Prionotus tribulus) primarily consumed crabs, more so by larger than smaller fish. Inshore lizardfish (Synodus foetens) was almost entirely piscivorous. Ocellated flounder (Ancylopsetta ommata) consumed fishes, crabs, and stomatopods. Dwarf <b>sand</b> <b>perch</b> (Diplectrum bivittatum), blackwing searobin (Prionotus rubio), rock sea bass (Centropristis philadelphica), southern kingfish (Menticirrhus americanus), and red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) fed mainly on shrimps. Most fish diets varied with respect to size (age), time of day, area sampled, depth, or season. Rimapenaeus and Sicyonia were the most frequently identified shrimp genera - only five Farfantepenaeus and no Litopenaeus were identified in almost 4, 300 fish stomachs. I also examined gonadal development and documented fish length-weight relationships. Ripe gonads were most frequently found during summer in dwarf <b>sand</b> <b>perch,</b> during fall in ocellated flounder and bighead searobin, and during spring for other species, except no ripe red snapper or bank sea bass were collected. Rock sea bass {{was found to be}} a protogynous hermaphrodite, while dwarf <b>sand</b> <b>perch</b> is a synchronous hermaphrodite. Only ocellated flounder and southern kingfish exhibited sex-related differences in length-weight relationships. (PDF contains 40 pages. ...|$|E

This {{study investigated the}} feeding of these four species in the São Sebastião Channel, São Paulo State (southeastern Brazil), comparing their diet, habitat utilization and morphological features related to foraging. These four serranids are opportunistic visual predators that use a total of nine different tactics to capture their preys, feed mostly on crustaceans {{during the day and}} twilight, and keep stationary and quiescent at night. The ecomorphological study was conducted to test its predictive value to infer lifestyles. It was verified that such analysis should be used carefully and must be complemented by field observations. Although morphologically and behaviorally very similar, D. formosum and D. radiale showed different preferences to the substratum type used by large individuals, which are exclusively sit-and-wait predators. On the other hand, E. marginatus displayed more sedentary habits than M. acutirostris, the most versatile predator from the studied species. The studied species of Diplectrum and E. marginatus can be regarded as benthic serranids, while M. acutirostris could be viewed as a nektobenthic species...|$|E

50|$|Adults feed on nectar {{and also}} take fluids from mud and damp <b>sand.</b> Males <b>perch</b> on bare ground or low plants, {{occasionally}} patrolling {{in search of}} females, {{but they are not}} territorial. The female lays eggs singly on buds or the upper side of leaves. The caterpillars are solitary and feed on the foliage, flowers, and fruits of the host plant. A variety of (typically) herbaceous plants are used, including especially plants in the snapdragon family (Scrophulariaceae). These include snapdragon (Antirrhinum), toadflax (Linaria), and Gerardia. Caterpillars also feed on plants of the plantain family, such as Plantago; and the Acanthus family including ruellia (Ruellia nodiflora). Larvae feed singly. Adults and some larvae overwinter in southern areas. The pupa may not have a resting phase (diapause), as in many other butterflies.|$|R

40|$|Although {{limited in}} coverage, <b>perched</b> <b>sand</b> dunes {{situated}} on high coastal bluffs {{are considered the}} most prized of Great Lakes dunes. Grand Sable Dunes on Lake Superior and Sleeping Bear Dunes on Lake Michigan are featured attractions of national lakeshores under National Park Service management. The source of <b>sand</b> for <b>perched</b> dunes is the high bluff along their lakeward edge. As onshore wind crosses the bluff, flow is accelerated upslope, resulting in greatly elevated levels of wind stress over the slope brow. On barren, sandy bluffs, wind erosion is concentrated in the brow zone, and for the Grand Sable Bluff, it averaged 1 m 3 /yr per linear meter along the highest sections for the period 1973 – 1983. This mechanism accounts for about 6, 500 m 3 of sand nourishment to the dunefield annually and clearly has been the predominant mechanism for the long-term development of the dunefield. However, wind erosion and dune nourishment are possible only where the bluff is denuded of plant cover by mass movements and related processes induced by wave erosion. In the Great Lakes, wave erosion and bluff retreat vary with lake levels; the nourishment of perched dunes is favored by high levels. Lake levels have been relatively high for the past 50 years, and shore erosion {{has become a major}} environmental issue leading property owners and politicians to support lake-level regulation. Trimming high water levels could reduce geomorphic activity on high bluffs and affect dune nourishment rates. Locally, nourishment also may be influenced by sediment accumulation associated with harbor protection facilities and by planting programs aimed at stabilizing dunes...|$|R

40|$|Naphthenic acids {{are known}} to be the most {{prevalent}} group of organic compounds in oil sands tailings-associated waters. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were exposed for four months to oil sands-influenced waters in two experimental systems located on an oil sands lease 30 km north of Fort McMurray Alberta: the Demonstration Pond, containing oil sands tailings capped with natural surface water, and the South Bison Pond, integrating lean oil <b>sands.</b> Yellow <b>perch</b> were also sampled from three lakes: Mildred Lake that receives water from the Athabasca River, Sucker Lake, at the edge of oil sands extraction activity, and Kimowin Lake, a distant reference site. Naphthenic acids were measured in perch muscle tissue using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Bile metabolites were measured by GC-MS techniques and by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection at phenanthrene wavelengths. A method was developed using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to evaluate naphthenic acids in bile. Tissue analysis did not show a pattern of naphthenic acids accumulation in muscle tissue consistent with known concentrations in exposed waters. Bile fluorescence and LC-HRMS methods were capable of statistically distinguishing samples originating from oil sands-influenced waters versus reference lakes. Although the GC-MS and HPLC fluorescence methods were correlated, there were no significant correlations of these methods and the LC-HRMS method. In yellow perch, naphthenic acids from oil sands sources do not concentrate in tissue at a measurable amount and are excreted through a biliary route. LC-HRMS was shown to be a highly sensitive, selective and promising technique as an indicator of exposure of biota to oil sands-derived naphthenic acids...|$|R

40|$|Lake Toolibin {{is one of}} a few {{remaining}} freshwater lakes in the central wheatbelt of Western Australia. Since monitoring began at Lake Toolibin in the early 19702 ̆ 7 s groundwater levels have risen to within 1 - 2 m of the lakebed with an accompanying migration of salt. The site-specific nature of water uptake in Casuarina obesa Miq. (the dominant lakebed tree species) and rhizosphere salinity were explored spatially through analyses of soil properties (groundwater depth and salinity, particle size and components of soil water potential ψ 1). Plant water sources (using δ 2 H signatures) and water availability (based on ψleaf and ψt) were measured to define water uptake within the rhizosphere. Plant response to these conditions was determined using critical indicators of plant water relations such as stomatal conductance (gs) and water use. This investigation was conducted over a drying period (October 2002 - February 2003) on the lakebed. The drying period coincided with a maximum in soil water potential (ψ 1) and sites with shallower depths to groundwater had soil profiles dominated by osmotic potentials (ψ 0) due to the accumulation of salts near the soil surface. At some sites groundwater was transmitted above the water table along films of coarse textured <b>sands,</b> forming <b>perched</b> systems of thin saturated soil (0. l - 0. 2 m). These were important mechanisms in the transport of saline groundwater to the rhizosphere. Patterns of water uptake for C. obesa across the lake appeared to be closely related to seasonal effects of the drying period and soil water and salt movement from the capillary fringe. Pre-dawn leaf water potentials (ψpd), stomatal conductance and water use decreased during summer at all sites, especially where salt accumulation had occurred, but this species exhibited substantial tolerance to moisture deficits caused by salt accumulation. C. obesa obtains its summer moisture from relatively shallow depths (3 ̆c 0. 9 m) and regulates water loss through stomatal control during this period, allowing it to persist under these conditions...|$|R
40|$|Frost {{penetration}} increases upslope on barren, windswept bluffs in cold environments. Along {{the south}} shore of Lake Superior, near the brow of 100 m high bluffs it typically exceeds 5 m. Frost increases the shear strength of damp sand to a level {{comparable to that of}} concrete, making winter slopes highly stable despite undercutting by waves and ground-water sapping along the footslope. Sublimation of interparticle ice in the slope face increases with wind speed and lower vapor pressures. The cold and dry winter winds of Lake Superior ablate these slopes through loss of binding ice. Wind erosion rates, based on measurements of sand accumulation on the forest floor downwind of the brow, show most airborne sand falls out within several meters of the brow, forming a berm 1 to 3 m high after many years. The spatial pattern of sand deposition, however, varies considerably over distances of several hundred meters along the top bluffs in response to frost conditions and the build-up of gravel lag on the slope face, sand exposure from mass movements, and local aerodynamics of the crest slope. The formation of <b>perched</b> <b>sand</b> dunes in the Great Lakes region is clearly related to wind erosion of sand from high bluffs in winter. Broadly similar processes may operate on Mars...|$|R

The objective of our research was to gain insights into the facility usage and behavioral needs of the hen over 24 h {{when there are no}} obvious restraints. Twenty ISA Brown commercial laying hens (Gallus domesticus) that were 18 wk old and not beak trimmed, were accommodated in a pen (4 × 6 m) at 19 ± 2 °C on a light-dark cycle of 10 L: 14 D. The pen providing nest boxes, drinkers, feeders, <b>perches,</b> <b>sand,</b> and wood shaving was designed to accommodate the hens for the experimental period. Video recordings were made for 10 d.

40|$|International audienceRapid {{assessments}} of landslides (including other mass movements of rock, snow and ice) {{as well as}} human impacts were conducted by many organizations immediately following the 25 April 2015 M 7. 8 Gorkha earthquake and its aftershock sequence. In particular, a NASA-led satellite mapping campaign identified over 4, 300 coseismic and post-seismic landslides throughout Nepal, largely concentrated in the “down-dropped northern tectonic block” well north of Kathmandu in the Greater Himalaya (Kargel et al., 2016). The Solukhumbu District lies at the eastern margin of this zone, near {{the epicenter of the}} 12 May 2015 M 7. 3 aftershock. Given the enormous cultural and economic value of the Khumbu region to Nepal, we conducted two post-monsoon ground {{assessments of}} geomorphic and structural damage in the fall of 2015, and a third ground assessment of rebuilding efforts in May, 2016. While landslides and other mass movements were not as extensive as those to the west, numerous landslides and slumps were identified, mostly on steep, convex-up, east-facing slopes where the dip of metamorphic foliation (Namche orthogneiss and related rocks) is towards the Dudh Kosi River channel. Also, building damage was more extensive where villages were located on terraces of unconsolidated <b>sand</b> and gravel <b>perched</b> above the Dudh Kosi River (Nakchun Village). The area upstream from Phakding experienced several co-seismic mass movements on steep slopes that had clearly failed before (previous temblors?), as evidenced by old vegetated slump blocks and steep, unstable hummocky terrain. Particularly hard-hit was the Sherpa village of Thame northwest of Namche Bazaar, constructed on unconsolidated, water-saturated glacial outwash between two lateral moraines {{at the mouth of the}} Thame Khola Valley. Aside from Thame, one is struck by the randomness of structural damage in many Sherpa villages, reflecting micro-ground conditions beneath buildings and the style and/or age of construction (dry-stacked fieldstone versus the use of mud or cement mortar, the presence of wire mesh or gabion bands/spacers within stone walls, etc.). Fresh valley-flank slumps and landslides were markedly less obvious further north (towards Everest) where wide glacial valleys exist, although evidence of large rock falls and other mass movements in the past is clearly present...|$|R
40|$|Bribie Island is a large, heterogeneous, sand {{barrier island}} that {{contains}} groundwater aquifers {{of commercial and}} environmental significance. Population growth has resulted in expanding residential developments and consequently increased demand for water. Caboolture Shire Council (CSC) has proposed to increase groundwater extraction by a new borefield. Two aquifers exist within the Quaternary sandmass which are separated by an indurated sand layer that is ubiquitous in the area. A shallow aquifer occurs in the surficial, clean <b>sands</b> and is <b>perched</b> on the indurated sands. Water levels in the shallow water table aquifer follow the topography and groundwater occurs under unconfined conditions in this system. A basal aquifer occurs beneath the indurated sands, which act as a semi-confining layer in the island system. The potentiometric surface of the basal aquifer occurs as a gentle groundwater mound. The shallow groundwater system supports water-dependent ecosystems including wetlands, native woodlands and commercial pine plantations. Excessive groundwater extraction could lower the water table in the shallow aquifer to below the root depth of vegetation on the island. Groundwater discharge along the coastline is essential to maintain {{the position of the}} saline water - fresh groundwater boundary in this island aquifer system. Any activity that changes the volume of fresh water discharge or lowers the water table or potentiometric surface below sea level will result in a consequent change in the saline water – freshwater interface and could lead to saline water intrusion. Groundwater level data was compared with the residual rainfall mass curve (RRMC) on hydrographs, which revealed that the major trends in groundwater levels are related to rainfall. Bribie Island has a sub-tropical climate, with a mean annual rainfall of around 1358 mm/year (Bongaree station). Mean annual pan evaporation is around 1679 mm/year and estimates of the potential evapotranspiration rates range from 1003 to 1293 mm/year. Flows from creeks, the central swale and groundwater discharged from the area have the potential to affect water quality within the tidal estuary, Pumicestone Passage. Groundwater within the island aquifer system is fresh with electrical conductivity ranging from 61 to 1018 ìS/cm while water near the coast, canals or tidal creeks is brackish to saline (1596 to 34800 ìS/cm). Measurements of pH show that all groundwater is acidic to slightly acidic (3. 3 - 6. 6), the lower values are attributed to the breakdown of plant material into organic acids. Groundwater is dominated by Na-Cl type water, which is expected in a coastal island environment with Na-Cl rainfall. Some groundwater samples possess higher concentrations of calcium and bicarbonate ions, which could be due to chemical interactions with buried shell beds while water is infiltrating to depth and due to the longer residence times of groundwater in the basal aquifer. A steady-state, sub-regional groundwater flow model was developed using the Visual MODFLOW computer package. The 4 layer, flow model simulated the existing hydrogeological system and the dominant groundwater processes controlling groundwater flow. The numerical model was calibrated against existing data and returned reasonable estimates of groundwater levels and hydraulic parameters. The model illustrated that: [...] The primary source of groundwater recharge is infiltration of rainfall for the upper, perched aquifer (Layer 1). Recharge for the lower sand layers is via vertical leakage from the upper, perched aquifer, through the indurated sands (Layers 2 and 3) to the semi-confined, basal aquifer (Layer 4). [...] The dominant drainage processes on Bribie Island are evapotranspiration (15070 m 3 /day) and groundwater seepage from the coast, canals and tidal creeks (9512 m 3 /day). Analytical calculations using Darcy’s Law estimated that approximately 8000 m 3 /day of groundwater discharges from central Bribie Island, approximately 16...|$|R
