5|$|<b>Shedding</b> one's clothes, Kutzer observes, is {{a symbol}} of <b>shedding</b> the social self and its {{constraints}} to then embrace the freedom of the animal self, but Lucie, who sets off for an adventure after <b>shedding</b> her pinafore and handkerchiefs, fails to embrace her animal self and learns nothing new about herself. True, she learns something about the animal world – hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests – but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking delight in the goffered pinafore and the laundered handkerchiefs that confine and define such a child. Having not learned something new about herself, Lucie's success as a literary heroine is moot.|$|E

5000|$|The {{simplest}} and least-expensive <b>sheds</b> {{are available}} in kit form. These kits are designed for regular {{people to be able}} to assemble themselves using commonly available tools (e.g., screwdriver). Both <b>shed</b> kits and DIY (do-it-yourself) plans are available for wooden and plastic <b>sheds.</b> <b>Sheds</b> are used to store home and garden tools and equipment such as lawn tractors, and gardening supplies. In addition, <b>sheds</b> can be used to store items that are not suitable for indoor storage, such as petrol (gasoline), pesticides, or herbicides. For homes with small gardens or modest storage needs, there are several types of very small <b>sheds.</b> The <b>sheds</b> not only use less ground area but also have a low profile less likely to obstruct the view or clash with the landscaping.These small <b>sheds</b> include corner <b>sheds,</b> which fit into a corner (3 ft tall × 3 wide × 2 deep, or 3 x 3 x 2 ft), vertical <b>sheds</b> (5 x 3 x 4 ft), horizontal <b>sheds</b> (3 x 5 x 4 ft), and tool <b>sheds.</b> When a <b>shed</b> is used for tool storage, shelves and hooks are often used to maximize the storage space. Gambrel-style roofed <b>sheds</b> (sometimes called baby barns), which resemble a Dutch-style barn, have a high sloping roofline which increases storage space in the [...] "loft" [...] area. Some Gambrel-styles have no loft and offer the advantage of reduced overall height. Another style of small <b>shed</b> is the saltbox-style <b>shed.</b>|$|R
