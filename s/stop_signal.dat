5|$|The 1996 Maryland train {{collision}} {{occurred on}} February 16, 1996, when a MARC commuter train collided with Amtrak's Capitol Limited passenger train in Silver Spring, Maryland. An {{investigation by the}} National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that {{the crew of the}} MARC train had forgotten the indication of an approach signal which they had passed before a station stop, and as a consequence could not slow down in time after encountering a <b>stop</b> <b>signal.</b> The collision killed three crew and eight passengers on the MARC train; a further eleven passengers on the MARC train and fifteen passengers and crew on the Capitol Limited were injured. Total damage was estimated at $7.5 million. The crash {{led to the creation of}} comprehensive federal rules for passenger car design, the first in the history of passenger service in the United States, as well as changes to operating rules.|$|E
25|$|The fast lines {{north of}} Harrow and all lines north of Rickmansworth are signalled with LUL signalling, but using four-aspect Network Rail signal heads. The upper two lights are a two-aspect <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> {{displaying}} either a green or red aspect, the lower two lights a repeater signal {{for the next}} <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> ahead showing a green or yellow aspect, or no aspect when the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> shows a red aspect. Thus they are effectively four-light three-aspect signals with green/red/green/yellow lights from the top, danger being a single red light, caution the top green light over a yellow light, and clear two green lights.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive control allows {{humans to}} {{overrule}} and inhibit habitual responses to optimize performance in challenging sit-uations. Contradicting traditional views, recent {{studies suggest that}} cognitive control processes can be initiated unconsciously. To further capture the relation between consciousness and cog-nitive control, we studied the dynamics of inhibitory control processes when triggered consciously versus unconsciously in {{a modified version of}} the stop task. Attempts to inhibit an im-minent response were often successful after unmasked (visible) <b>stop</b> <b>signals.</b> Masked (invisible) <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> rarely succeeded in instigating overt inhibition but did trigger slowing down of re-sponse times. Masked <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> elicited a sequence of dis-tinct ERP components that were also observed on unmasked <b>stop</b> <b>signals.</b> The N 2 component correlated with the efficiency of inhibitory control when elicited by unmasked <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> and with the magnitude of slowdown when elicited by masked <b>stop</b> <b>signals.</b> Thus, the N 2 likely reflects the initiation of inhibi-tory control, irrespective of conscious awareness. The P 3 compo-nent was much reduced in amplitude and duration on masked versus unmasked stop trials. These patterns of differences and similarities between conscious and unconscious cognitive con-trol processes are discussed in a framework that differentiates between feedforward and feedback connections in yielding con-scious experience. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} central and peripheral targets in a saccadic countermanding task. Stop-signal reaction times (SSRTs) do not differ significantly for central and peripheral <b>stop</b> <b>signals.</b> Further, when central and peripheral <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> are presented together, SSRTs behave as expected of independent processes in parallel. A linear rise-to-threshold race model (LATER) with independent go and stop processes describes the behavioural data successfully, predicting not only the latency distribution of saccades that escaped inhibition, but also the probability of successful countermanding. Central and peripheral <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> appear to act independently and with equal effectiveness...|$|R

25|$|In {{semaphore}} areas, junctions are signalled using {{a series}} of between 2 and 5 <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> arms on one bracket or gantry, known as splitting signals. Each arm (usually) has its own post ("doll") on the bracket, and each arm applies to one possible route. The relative heights of the dolls usually convey some information about the lines to which they apply, {{although there is no}} definite standard. In some cases, the tallest doll applies to the highest-speed route; in others, it applies to what the railway considered the most important route. Traditionally, splitting distant signals would be provided – {{a series of}} side-by-side distant signals telling the driver which doll on the following <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> was off; but practice since the 1920s has erred towards providing just one distant which is locked at caution if a large speed reduction is necessary. Drivers of trains must know which signal arm applies to which route, and the speed limit on that route; accidents have resulted from drivers either mis-reading splitting signals or forgetting speed restrictions, and consequently approaching junctions too fast.|$|E
25|$|Two common {{tests of}} {{response}} inhibition used in humans are the go/no-go task, {{and a slight}} variant known as the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> reaction time (SSRT) test. During a go/no-task, the participant is trained over multiple trials to make a particular response (e.g., a key-press) when presented with a 'go' signal. On some trials, a 'stop' signal is presented just prior to, or simultaneously with the 'go' signal, and the subject must inhibit the impending response.|$|E

Sanchez, failed to obey a red <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> that indicated {{it was not}} safe to proceed into the single track section. The train dispatcher's computer at a remote control center in Pomona did not display a warning prior to the accident according to the NTSB. Metrolink initially reported that the dispatcher {{tried in vain to}} contact the train crew to warn them; but the NTSB contradicted this report, saying the dispatcher noticed a problem only after the accident, and was notified by the passenger train's conductor first.|$|E

40|$|Palatable {{foods in}} the {{environment}} can unintentionally trigger reactions to obtain them, which may interfere with dieting attempts. We tested a strategy to facilitate dieting behavior that makes use of behavioral <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> that should instantly inhibit chronic dieters’ responses toward palatable foods. Participants performed a go/no-go task in which go cues and no-go cues (i. e., the behavioral <b>stop</b> <b>signals)</b> were presented with pictures of palatable foods and control objects. In Study 1, we tested the immediate behavioral effect of presenting <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> near palatable foods in a reaction time paradigm. In Study 2 we assessed consumption of palatable food that had either consistently been associated with no-go cues, or not. Results show that no-go cues instantly inhibited responses toward palatable foods especially among chronic dieters. Moreover, across a one day period chronic dieters consumed less of a food that had consistently been associated with no-go cues. <b>Stop</b> <b>signals</b> thus appear a promising tool for chronic dieters to control behavior to palatable foods, and we discuss the merits and potential applications of this tool for facilitating dieting behavior...|$|R

25|$|Primase adds RNA primers {{onto the}} lagging strand, which allows {{synthesis}} of Okazaki fragments from 5' to 3'. However, primase creates RNA primers {{at a much}} lower rate than that at which DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA on the leading strand. DNA polymerase on the lagging strand also has to be continually recycled to construct Okazaki fragments following RNA primers. This makes the speed of lagging strand synthesis much lower than that of the leading strand. To solve this, primase acts as a temporary <b>stop</b> <b>signal,</b> briefly halting the progression of the replication fork during DNA replication. This molecular process prevents the leading strand from overtaking the lagging strand.|$|E
25|$|This scheme, on {{the face}} of it, was a fairly {{standard}} colour light system, with each <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> (which could show red or green) having an attendant repeater signal (showing red, yellow or green – the red used only for when the two stop signals on either side were also red). What made the scheme unusual was the provision of an automatic 'calling on' facility. The stop signals had an additional signal head ('marker light') that featured a red aspect plus a miniature yellow aspect. This marker light was mounted part way up the post. On repeater signals, the marker light was offset to the left-hand side of the post to indicate that the 'stop and proceed' rule applied. Junction stop signals were provided with two main signal heads, one mounted higher than the other. Splitting distant signals had three main heads, the centre one mounted higher than the other two.|$|E
25|$|Those {{trials in}} which the subject reacted to the go-signal impulsively without seeing a {{subsequent}} signal show a quick RT of about 600ms. Those trials {{in which the}} decide signal was shown too late, and the participant had already enacted their impulse to press the go-button (i.e. had not decided to do so), also show a quick RT of about 600ms. Those trials in which a <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> was shown and the participant successfully responded to it, do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant decided not to press the go-button, also do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant had not already enacted their impulse to press the go-button, but (in which it was theorised that they) had {{had the opportunity to}} decide what to do, show a comparatively slow RT, in this case closer to 1400ms.|$|E

25|$|The SSRT test is similar, {{except that}} the 'stop' signal is {{presented}} after the 'go' signal. This small modification increases the difficulty of inhibiting the 'go' response, because the participant has typically already initiated the 'go' response {{by the time the}} 'stop' signal is presented. The participant is instructed to respond as fast as possible to the 'go' signal while maintaining the highest possible inhibition accuracy (on no-go trials). During the task, the time at which the 'stop' signal is presented (the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> delay or SSD) is dynamically adjusted to match the time after the 'go' signal at which the participant is just able/unable to inhibit their 'go' response. If the participant fails to inhibit their 'go' response, the 'stop' signal is moved slightly closer to the original 'go' signal, and if the participant successfully inhibits their 'go' response, the 'stop' signal is moved slightly ahead in time. The SSRT is thus measured as the average 'go' response time minus the average 'stop' signal presentation time (SSD).|$|E
25|$|Though {{the exact}} role of OA1 {{is yet to}} be confirmed, many studies give clues about the {{probable}} roles of OA1. The Oa1 gene product might be involved in vesicular trafficking or sorting them to the melanosomes. It is also believed to be involved in redistribution of mannose-6-phosphate receptors, thus suggesting that it is important for melanogensis. Literature shows that it {{plays a major role in}} the final stages of growth and maturation of melanosomes. This conclusion is based on the fact that there are no intermediates of melanosome-melanosome fusion and the number of melanosomes decreases only on maturation of the cell and not in the initial stages of development. A number of genes in Drosophila, like the hook gene that alter ocular pigment granules have been shown to affect lysosomal delivery. Moreover, it has been found that in normal conditions, melanosomal proteins traffic normally to late endosomes, while in the absence of OA1, they continue to accumulate in the mature melanosomes. This may mean that OA1 acts as a <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> for melanosomal growth.|$|E

40|$|In the stop-signal paradigm, fast {{responses}} {{are harder to}} inhibit than slow responses, so participants must balance speed on the go task with successful stopping in the stop task. In theory, participants achieve this balance by adjusting response thresholds for the go task, making proactive adjustments in response to instructions that indicate that relevant <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> are likely to occur. The 5 experiments reported here tested this theoretical claim, presenting cues that indicated whether or not <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> were relevant {{for the next few}} trials. Subjects made proactive response-strategy adjustments in each experiment: Diffusionmodel fits showed that response threshold increased when participants expected <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> to occur, slowing go responses and increasing accuracy. Furthermore, the results show that subjects can make proactive response-strategy adjustments on a trial-by-trial basis, suggesting a flexible cognitive system that can proactively adjust itself in changing environments...|$|R

40|$|Prokaryotic {{release factor}} RF 3 is a stimulatory protein that {{increases}} the rate of translational termination by the decoding release factors RF 1 and RF 2. The favoured model for RF 3 function is the recycling of RF 1 and RF 2 after polypeptide release by displacing the factors from the ribosome. In this study, we have demonstrated that RF 3 also plays an indirect role in the decoding of <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> of highly expressed genes and recoding sites by accentuating {{the influence of the}} base following the stop codon (+ 4 base) on termination signal strength. The efficiency of decoding strong <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> (e. g. UAAU and UAAG) in vivo is markedly improved with increased RF 3 activity, while weak signals (UGAC and UAGC) are only modestly affected. However, RF 3 is not responsible for the + 4 base influence on termination signal strength, since prfC- strains lacking the protein still exhibit the same qualitative effect. The differential effect of RF 3 at <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> can be mimicked by modest overexpression of decoding RF. These findings can be interpreted according to current views of RF 3 as a recycling factor, which functions to maintain the concentration of free decoding RF at <b>stop</b> <b>signals,</b> some of which are highly responsive to changes in RF levels...|$|R
