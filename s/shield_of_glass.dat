50|$|During her trek {{through her}} {{starting}} location, Dr. Grant stumbles upon a solitary living ship floating {{farther away from}} the others. This one differs in many aspects to the former living islands, such as its material being darker in color, and that its sails are composed of a blue/pink plasma material instead of mesh cloth. Up an elevator is a control room with circular panels. Setting coordinates utilize two panels like a clock. An alcove in the wall holds a plant bud that blooms when the Wanderer from Matia's Zone is deposited. Pressing of that button activates <b>shields</b> <b>of</b> green <b>glass</b> and blasts the island out of the water, turning it into a rocket for Earth and revealing a glowing white object with a fish-like tentacle protruding from it, holding a semicircular fin made out of the same material as the sails.|$|R

Then Ulysses put the phial in his wallet, and crept very cautiously to the altar, in the dark, and stole the Luck of Troy. It was only a small black mass of what is now called meteoric iron, which sometimes comes down with meteorites from the sky, but it was shaped like a shield, and the people thought it an image <b>of</b> the warlike <b>shielded</b> Goddess, fallen from Heaven. Such sacred <b>shields,</b> made <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> and ivory, are found deep in the earth in the ruined cities of Ulysses' time. Swiftly Ulysses hid the Luck in his rags and left in its place on the altar a copy of the Luck, which he had made of blackened clay. Then he stole back to the place where he had lain, and remained there till dawn appeared, and the sleepers who sought for dreams awoke, and the temple gates were opened, and Ulysses walked out with the rest of them.|$|R
40|$|Recycled glass {{derived from}} cathode ray tubes (CRT) glass with a {{specific}} gravity of approximately 3. 0 g/cm 3 can be potentially suitable {{to be used as}} fine aggregate for preparing cement mortars for X-ray radiation-shielding applications. In this work, the effects <b>of</b> using crushed <b>glass</b> derived from crushed CRT funnel glass (both acid washed and unwashed) and crushed ordinary beverage container glass at different replacement levels (0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % by volume) of sand on the mechanical properties (strength and density) and radiation-shielding performance of the cement-sand mortars were studied. The results show that all the prepared mortars had compressive strength values greater than 30 MPa which are suitable for most building applications based on ASTM C 270. The density and <b>shielding</b> performance <b>of</b> the mortar prepared with ordinary crushed (lead-free) glass was similar to the control mortar. However, a significant enhancement of radiation-shielding was achieved when the CRT glasses were used due to the presence of lead in the glass.

40|$|The {{necessity}} to reduce energy requirements of lighting systems should bring among engineers a more mature and conscious vision while planning and {{this means that}} their main goals should be the visual comfort {{and a decrease in}} energy and maintenance costs. Therefore this paper examines the case study of a classroom located in the Faculty of Engineering of Sapienza University in Rome and, to evaluate the possibility to combine natural and artificial light, it focuses on the realization of a new lighting system. This new solution is formed by LED sources and control systems able to modulate the power absorbed by every single lamp (to adapt, according to the hour and day, to the conditions of the natural light). In order to meet the EN 12464 - 1, the process of incorporating natural and artificial light must occur while guaranteeing both the minimum levels expected for the average illuminance Em [lx] and the uniformity coefficient (Emin/Em) and this is the reason why a simultaneous exertion of artificial lights and a variable <b>shielding</b> system <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> surfaces activated through a motorized electronic control unit is required. Thanks to the software DIALux Evo 5. 1 a 3 D model of the classroom was reproduced and validated in order to simulate the combination of natural and artificial lighting and to verify if the results complied with the regulations. This was followed by an analysis concerning: the reliability of the system (through the examination of the MTBF - Mean Time Between Failure) and energetic and economic aspects (through the software ecoCALC 4. 5. 4). The novelty of this study is represented by the fact that in order to obtain the highest results {{in each of the three}} fields examined, it is possible to avoid the exertion of those negative feedback control-type systems (requiring high installation and maintenance costs due to sensor devices), thanks to pre-programmed logic control systems based on the data obtained with the simulations by prediction softwares. In this case study the solution suggested, while using a pre-programmed control logic, presents a MTBF of 1205 h (about twice of a negative feedback system solution) with payback periods that justify the higher costs presented by the electronic characterizing the control logic system with respect to traditional plant solutions...|$|R
