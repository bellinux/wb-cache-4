5000|$|After primary {{infection}} of BoHV-1, the latent infection is quite {{often found in}} the trigeminal ganglion of the cow, although on occasion infection can enter the central nervous system. These latent infections can possibly reactivate, with or without clinical symptoms, under conditions of stress or by experimental methods. Infected animals will be continuous shedders throughout their lifetime when the virus reactivates; therefore, successfully propagating the disease. The virus sheds in such high titers that it will spread rapidly throughout a herd. Even though cattle might not be showing clinical signs they can still spread the disease. Aside from cattle, studies experimentally infecting animals have shown that goats and buffalo can act as reservoirs for BoHV-1, as well as red deer, sheep, swine, and reindeer. [...] Shedding begins from the nasal mucosa as soon as infection occurs, and the virus has replicated in the upper respiratory tract. During replication in the respiratory tract cells of the epithelial will undergo apoptosis. The necrosis in the epithelial will result in an entry site for secondary infections that may result in <b>shipping</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E

50|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (BoHV-1) is a virus of {{the family}} Herpesviridae and the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, known to cause several diseases worldwide in cattle, including rhinotracheitis, vaginitis, balanoposthitis, abortion, conjunctivitis, and enteritis. BoHV-1 is also a contributing factor in <b>shipping</b> <b>fever,</b> also known as bovine respiratory disease (BRD). It is spread horizontally through sexual contact, artificial insemination, and aerosol transmission and {{it may also be}} transmitted vertically across the placenta. BoHV-1 can cause both clinical and subclinical infections, depending on the virulence of the strain. Although these symptoms are mainly non-life-threatening it is an economically important disease as infection may cause a drop in production and affect trade restrictions. Like other herpesviruses, BoHV-1 causes a lifelong latent infection and sporadic shedding of the virus. The sciatic nerve and trigeminal nerve are the sites of latency. A reactivated latent carrier is normally the source of infection in a herd. The clinical signs displayed are dependent on the virulence of the strain. There is a vaccine available which reduces the severity and incidence of disease. Some countries in Europe have successfully eradicated the disease by applying a strict culling policy.|$|E
40|$|The {{etiology}} of respiratory disease of cattle, or <b>shipping</b> <b>fever,</b> {{has been the}} subject of investigations for many years. Bacteria, undoubtedly, play a role in this disease as symptoms quite often are ameliorated by the use of antibiotics.

40|$|A {{total of}} 58, 885 spring-born calves {{entering}} a large commercial feedlot in southwestern Alberta were studied {{to examine the}} associations between <b>shipping</b> <b>fever</b> mortality and the pattern of calf sales at the auction markets, time of year, and weather. The observational study followed calves purchased from 42 auction markets in the 4 western provinces between September 1 and December 31 {{in each of the}} years from 1985 to 1988. Calf sales at the auction markets consistently peaked during the last week of October and the first week of November. Calves entering the feedlot in November had a risk of fatal <b>shipping</b> <b>fever</b> 2 to 8 times greater than calves entering in September or December. The pattern was the same for all 4 years, with maximum risk occurring 2 to 4 weeks after the peak time for calf sales at the markets. A number of factors could have contributed to this pattern, including changes in transport truck availability, changes in the density of calves at the markets, changes in population dynamics at the feedlot that affected feedlot crew efficiency, and weather. The finding that the risk of fatal <b>shipping</b> <b>fever</b> appears to increase significantly as the feedlot fills with calves in the fall deserves the attention of feedlot owners, so they can design their treatment strategies appropriately, and of researchers, who may gain useful knowledge about the natural history of the disease by investigating why this change in risk occurs...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{enrofloxacin}} therapy {{was investigated in}} 110 male double-muscled cattle weighing 275 +/- 3 kg, during a spontaneous outbreak of <b>shipping</b> <b>fever</b> occurring 11 +/- 2 days after they arrived in the feedlot. Forty-six diseased animals were divided randomly into three groups A, B and C, containing 17, 19 and 10 animals, respectively; the animals in group A were injected intramuscularly once daily for three consecutive days with 2. 5 mg/kg of enrofloxacin, those in group B with 5 mg/kg of enrofloxacin and those in group C with 10 mg/kg of oxytetracycline. Clinical, serological, production and respiratory functional observations were recorded. The animals were clinically cured after the three day treatment except for three in group A and two in group C. These five animals made a clinical recovery after a three day booster treatment with a dose of 5 mg/kg enrofloxacin. The changes in respiratory gas exchange values induced by <b>shipping</b> <b>fever</b> were completely reversed 15 days later, suggesting {{that there had been}} no irreversible lung damage. The daily weight gains and the arterial blood gas values of the three groups of treated cattle were not significantly different. The high efficacy of the low dosage of enrofloxacin in this clinical syndrome may be explained by its antibacterial activity against Pasteurella species and Mycoplasma species.

40|$|Year in {{and year}} out, {{diseases}} of the respiratory system are {{a major cause of}} illness and death in cattle from 6 weeks to two years of age. Sadly, this is as true today as it was 30 years ago despite development of new and improved vaccines, new broad spectrum antibiotics, and increased fundamental knowledge as to the cause of disease. WHY? I don‟t have the answer and I doubt if anyone does. As a pathologist, I often see firsthand the devastating effects that bacteria can have in the lungs of cattle that die from respiratory disease complex or <b>shipping</b> <b>fever.</b> I often wonder to myself, “They know this calf had a bacterial pneumonia, why did they send it in?” “What do I need to know to do a better job?” Is there some missing bit of information that will tie this all together?” As a pathologist, I also see lungs from cattle suspected of <b>shipping</b> <b>fever</b> that might have looked abnormal in the field but with no evidence of pneumonia when examined microscopically.
