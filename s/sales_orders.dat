The customer's PO is the originating document which triggers the creation of the <b>sales</b> <b>order.</b> A <b>sales</b> <b>order,</b> being an internal document, can therefore contain many customer purchase orders under it. In a manufacturing environment, a <b>sales</b> <b>order</b> can be converted into a work order to show that work is about to begin to manufacture, build or engineer the products the customer wants.|$|R
