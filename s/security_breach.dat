5|$|In {{addition}} to The Chaser's major APEC <b>security</b> <b>breach,</b> the team performed stunts at the APEC Summit that received far less {{coverage in the}} media.|$|E
5|$|On 10 September 2007, Licciardello rang a {{talkback}} {{radio station}} {{pretending to be}} someone else, and complained about the stunt, claiming that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC, including Kerry O'Brien, should be jailed for ten years. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said {{he wished he had}} made the call on the evening of the <b>security</b> <b>breach</b> because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E
5|$|Air force experts raised {{questions}} and the Malaysian opposition leveled criticisms {{about the state of}} Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities. Many criticized the failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace. The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance. The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a <b>security</b> <b>breach,</b> and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation.|$|E

Within {{the last few}} years, numerous examples of data such as Social Security numbers, bank account, credit card, driverâ€™s license numbers, and medical and student records have been compromised. A major reason for the increased awareness of these <b>security</b> <b>breaches</b> is a California law that requires notice of <b>security</b> <b>breaches</b> to the affected individuals. This law, implemented in July 2003, {{was the first of}} its kind in the nation...|$|R
5|$|In 2016, reporters for the {{newspaper}} were reportedly the target of cyber <b>security</b> <b>breaches.</b> The Federal Bureau of Investigation was reportedly investigating the attacks.

5|$|In April 1987 Reagan {{appointed}} Matlock as Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Conditions at the Embassy were tense, as Marine Sergeant Clayton Lonetree {{had been}} found to have compromised Embassy security. Within a few months of the Lonetree scandal, all U.S. intelligence assets in the Soviet Union had been exposed. The Americans suspected that the <b>security</b> <b>breach</b> had meant that the Embassy code room was no longer secure and worked frantically to determine how. It was not until 1994 that Aldrich Ames, a mole within the CIA, was caught. Another mole, Robert Hanssen, this time within the FBI, was caught only in 2001.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September 2007, {{following}} the <b>security</b> <b>breach</b> {{on the previous}} day, Taylor, Reucassel, Dominic Knight and their film crew were detained and questioned over a follow-up stunt. This incident involved running near and attempting to enter the APEC protected zone dressed in cardboard cars mounted with Canadian flags, {{a reference to the}} flags' earlier use to disguise the successful breach by the real motorcade. Police {{had no choice but to}} release all members involved in this stunt, as they were outside the prohibited area. This stunt also aired on the 12 September episode.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} before its release, a number of texts {{purporting}} to be genuine leaks appeared in various forms. On 16 July, a set of photographs representing all 759 pages of the U.S. edition was leaked and was fully transcribed prior to the official release date. The photographs later appeared on websites and peer-to-peer networks, leading Scholastic to seek a subpoena {{in order to identify}} one source. This represented the most serious <b>security</b> <b>breach</b> in the Harry Potter series' history. Rowling and her lawyer confirmed that there were genuine online leaks. Reviews published in both The Baltimore Sun and The New York Times on 18 July 2007, corroborated many of the plot elements from this leak, and about one day prior to release, The New York Times confirmed that the main circulating leak was real.|$|E

5|$|It {{was common}} for Christie to greet a {{returning}} submarine at the pier, and to award decorations {{to the crew}} on the spot. This bypassed naval award boards, and annoyed Kinkaid and Lockwood, possibly because confirmation of sinkings was accomplished by Ultra, the reading of coded Japanese radio traffic, and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a <b>security</b> <b>breach.</b> Complicating the matter was the fact MacArthur awarded army decorations to naval personnel; like Christie, he {{took it upon himself}} to authorize the decorations rather than to go through the standard review procedures. These events compelled Kinkaid to forbid Christie to give pierside awards, and to keep Christie from recommending the award of army medals to navy personnel. These events would ultimately contribute to Christie's dismissal as Commander of Submarines in Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|The first incident, on 17 May 2010, {{involved}} a breach in the perimeter fence of Changi Depot {{and resulted in}} the imprisonment and caning of a Swiss citizen, and an Interpol arrest warrant for his accomplice. The train involved was set 047/048, a C151 train. SMRT Corporation received a S$50,000 fine by the Land Transport Authority for the first <b>security</b> <b>breach.</b> Measures {{were put in place}} by the Public Transport Security Committee to enhance depot security in light of the first incident, but works were yet to be completed by SMRT Corporation when the second incident, on 17 August 2011, occurred at Bishan Depot.|$|E
5|$|Activision {{introduced}} {{the game in}} May 2003, but in October, Valve experienced a <b>security</b> <b>breach</b> in which hackers stole the source code for Half-Life 2. The breach required new security implementations for the engine, delaying both games; the release of Bloodlines was postponed until early 2005. Until May 2004, Troika and Activision said that the game would feature a multiplayer component and modes including a team of vampires against a team of vampire hunters, {{with the ability to}} upgrade characters between each round. The team was left without a producer by Activision for over a year before David Mullich was assigned to the project. With no producer oversight, Mullich found the game's design incomplete, game levels created and abandoned, and several technical issues, including problems with code for the proposed multiplayer option. The Source multiplayer code was in its infancy, increasing its development time, and the idea was abandoned.|$|E

Further evidence of the continuing problems associated with computer <b>security</b> <b>breaches</b> is provided by the fact that Representative Stephen Horn, in his second annual report card on computer security within the federal government, gave the federal agencies an overall average grade of F (Dean 2001). It is generally recognized that a key ingredient required to improve computer security is the gathering, analysis and sharing of information related to actual, as well as unsuccessful attempts at, computer <b>security</b> <b>breaches.</b> In the regard, in 1998 the U.
