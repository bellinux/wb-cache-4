In this dissertation we study modeling, identification {{and control of}} hysteresis in <b>smart</b> <b>actuators.</b> While the approaches are applicable to control of a wide class of <b>smart</b> <b>actuators,</b> we illustrate the ideas through the example of controlling a magnetostrictive actuator. Hysteresis exhibited by magnetostrictive actuators is rate-independent when the input frequency is low and we can model it by a Preisach operator.

In this case, we propose a new dynamic hysteresis model, consisting of a Preisach operator coupled to an ordinary differential equation in an unusual way. We establish its well-posedness and study its various system-theoretic properties. Existence of periodic solutions under periodic forcing is proved. Algorithms for simulation of the model are also studied. Parameter identification methods for both the Preisach operator and the dynamic model are investigated. We pursue the problem of hysteresis control along three different but connected paths: inverse control, robust control and optimal control. The idea of inverse control is to construct an inverse operator to cancel out the hysteretic nonlinearity.

40|$|<b>Smart</b> <b>actuators</b> such as piezoceramics, {{magnetostrictive}} {{and shape}} memory alloy actuators, invariably, exhibit hysteresis, which {{has been associated with}} oscillations in the open-loop system's responses, and poor tracking performance and potential instabilities of the close-loop system. A number of phenomological operator-based hysteresis models such as the Preisach model, Krasnosel'skii-Pokrovskii model and Prandtl-Ishlinskii model, have been formulated to describe the hysteresis nonlinearities and to seek compensation of the hysteresis effects. Among these, the Prandtl-Ishlinskii model offers greater flexibility and unique property that its inverse can be attained analytically. The Prandtl-Ishlinskii model, however, is limited to rate-independent and symmetric hysteresis nonlinearities. In this dissertation research, the unique flexibility of the Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is explored for describing the symmetric as well as nonlinear hysteresis and output saturation properties of <b>smart</b> <b>actuators,</b> and for deriving an analytical inverse for effective compensation. A generalized play operator with dissimilar envelope functions is proposed to describe asymmetric hysteresis and output saturation nonlinearities of different <b>smart</b> <b>actuators,</b> when applied in conjunction with the classical Prandtl-Ishlinskii model. Dynamic density and dynamic threshold functions of time rate of the input are further proposed and integrated in the classical model to describe rate-dependent symmetric and asymmetric hysteresis properties of <b>smart</b> <b>actuators.</b> A fundamental relationship between the thresholds of the classical and the resulting generalized models is also formulated to facilitate parameters identification. The validity of the resulting generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii models is demonstrated using the laboratory-measured data for piezoceramic, magnetostrictive and SMA actuators under different inputs over a broad range of frequencies. The results suggest that the proposed generalized models can effectively characterize the rate-dependent as well as rate-independent hysteresis properties of a broad class of <b>smart</b> <b>actuators</b> with output saturation. The properties of the proposed generalized models are subsequently explored to derive its inverse to seek an effective compensator for the asymmetric as well as rate-dependent hysteresis effects. The resulting inverse is applied as a feedforward compensator and simulation results are obtained to demonstrate its effectiveness in compensating the symmetric as well as asymmetric hysteresis of different <b>smart</b> <b>actuators.</b> The effectiveness of the proposed analytical inverse model-based real-time compensator is further demonstrated through its implementation in the laboratory for a piezoceramic actuator. Considering that the generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model provides an estimate of the hysteresis properties and the analytical inverse is a hysteresis model, the output of the inverse compensation is expected to yield hysteresis, although of a considerably lower magnitude. The expected compensation error, attributed to possible errors in hysteresis characterization, is analytically derived {{on the basis of the}} generalized model and its inverse. The design of a robust controller is presented for a system preceded by the hysteresis effects of an actuator using the proposed error model. The primary purpose is to fuse the analytical inverse compensation error model with an adaptive controller to achieve to enhance tracking precision. The global stability of the chosen control law and the entire closed-loop system is also analytically established.
