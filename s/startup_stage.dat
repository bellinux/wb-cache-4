40|$|Control {{systems for}} {{logistic}} and transport systems {{are among the}} most complex control systems in existence. Currently control systems are only fully tested at the shop floor after commissioning. This means a lot of costly failures occur at the <b>startup</b> <b>stages</b> of control systems. The goal {{of this paper is to}} describe the extended role that simulation can play in evaluating of fully automated logistic systems and their control systems before commissioning. We followed a three-step approach in evaluating both logistic and logistic control systems. A simulated control system was used to control simulated, emulated, and real prototypes of logistic resources. Three different simulation packages have been used; Simple++, AutoMod, Arena. The control system was implemented in all three simulation packages to control logistic resources at the Connekt TestSite. The TestSite is a special laboratory for testing new technologies in logistic automation...|$|R
40|$|Business Model Innovation (BMI) is {{a process}} new ventures are {{frequently}} involved in, specifically in dynamic environments like the digital one: copying with the “transitory phase” from one Business Model (BM) to another is hence a key issue for entrepreneurs attempting to shorten the transition and avoid losses in terms of revenue, image and customer retention. However, the extant literature and practice shows fragmentation in the methodologies to execute BMI. This study aims at extending the use of Lean principles to operationalize BMI. By considering analogies between the operational and strategic levels, and performing a multiple case study on digital new ventures, the study proposes to revisit the SMED model and integrate it with additional Lean principles to develop an original “SMED for BMI” framework. The framework extends the traditional Lean Startup Approach and may support in every process of BMI, not simply its initial pivotal in early <b>startup</b> <b>stages...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Dewey is {{scheduled}} to attend the convention for a public debate on privacy rights with Aaron Kalloor, CEO of social media giant Deep Dream. Kalloor is {{the public face of}} corporate social responsibility in the Internet age, but he was secretly funded by Dewey in the <b>startup</b> <b>stage.</b> The CIA director intends to use Deep Dream for real-time mass surveillance alongside the latest incarnation of the CIA's targeted assassination 'Beta' program, known as [...] "Iron Hand". When Kalloor has second thoughts about giving the CIA access to Deep Dream, Dewey authorizes the Asset to assassinate Kalloor and Lee. Bourne thwarts the assassinations and confronts Dewey in his suite. Dewey appeals to Bourne's sense of patriotism as he stalls for time. Bourne kills Jeffers, Dewey's right-hand man. Lee kills Dewey before he can shoot Bourne. Bourne covers up Lee's involvement before chasing the Asset on the Las Vegas Strip and finally killing him during a brutal hand-to-hand fight.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{experimental}} studies, {{this paper}} discusses the variation tendencies of three non-dimensional parameters including Ja, Bo and Pr which consist of various operational parameters and characteristic parameters, and then analyses {{their effects on}} heat transfer performance of closed-loop pulsating heat pipes (PHPs) at <b>startup</b> <b>stage</b> and steady operation stage. Results indicate that at <b>startup</b> <b>stage,</b> the values of Ja and Bo increase over time as a whole, while the values of Pr decrease; at steady operation stage, the values of three parameters all fluctuate within a narrow range. The results also show that heat transfer is due mainly to the exchange of latent heat under the experimental conditions...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{discover}} the use and benefit of business models {{in the early stages}} of startup businesses. The researchers focused on the professional services and retail sales industry and interviewed entrepreneurs from two countries as their case study in order to assess the success of business models through the first hand experiences of the entrepreneurs as they applied business models in their startup companies. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to find out how the business model framework is used by small firms in the <b>startup</b> <b>stage.</b> This academic work also aims to increase the significance of the theory described here with the help of a qualitative study of a particular situation: the study of the business model structure built by entrepreneurs in the <b>startup</b> <b>stage</b> of their small firms, all of them belonging to the service sector. Will be taken as an example two developing countries, considering that their economies are tightly hinged on the success of small firms in the service sector, which accounts for about 60 % of their economy. The aim is to explain among the main elements of a business model, which are the most relevant when starting a company, for a further value creation and to what extent does the business model framework benefit them. Research Implications: This study also continues the pathway of research on business models and entrepreneurship, in conjunction with the empirical investigation of companies willing to be measured in terms of their performance, study that might require time and resources but could be done as future research to answer the question on whether there is a connection between performance and the architecture of the business model. Practical Implications: The practical implications of this study contribute to the way entrepreneurs would do business in the <b>startup</b> <b>stage</b> in their firms. The use of business models may have a huge impact in the overall success of the firm in its <b>startup</b> <b>stage,</b> thereby contributing positively in the economy of a country...|$|E

40|$|Startups are an {{important}} entity to bring new ideas into the world. However, {{nine out of ten}} early <b>stage</b> <b>startups</b> fail. There are many factors contributing to the fate of a startup. Incorporating user experience (UX) design into an early <b>stage</b> <b>startup</b> can increase its chances of success. UX designers have the capability to generate and evaluate ideas, as well as conduct user research, visualize concepts for communication, and create prototypes for user testing. Despite the valuable skills a UX designer might bring to a startup, many startups lack in-depth knowledge about design and access to the design community. A shallow understanding of design leads many startups to only add a designer’s input at the end for visual design. The proposed solution, CreativeConnect, is a platform connecting early <b>stage</b> <b>startups</b> with UX designers. CreativeConnect builds a community of UX designers and provides entrepreneurs and aspiring designers access to that community. Through tools and services provided by the platform, those outside of the design community can gain a deeper understanding of design. By utilizing design beyond visual design, startups can connect with their users on another level and increase their chances of success...|$|R
30|$|The {{predictable}} framework defines {{that the}} growth path can be linear, sequential, deterministic, and invariant (Churchill and Lewis 1983; Greiner 1972; Adizes 1979; Kimberly 1979; Hanks et al. 1993). There are different thoughts on defining the growth path of an enterprise in a predictable way starting from existence, survival, success, takeoff, maturity, and then reinvention or death (Churchill and Lewis 1983; Casson 1982). The enterprise competitiveness continuously increases from the <b>startup</b> <b>stage</b> to maturity stage. At the decline stage, the competitiveness of the enterprise weakens and signals that in case the enterprise do not upgrades itself, it will fall. Chen et al. (2008) suggest that the enterprise at different life cycle stages should focus on strengthening capabilities.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Software Defined Networks (SDN) aim to {{deconstruct}} current routers into a {{small number}} of controllers, which are general purpose machines, and a large number of switches that contain programmable forwarding engines. The vision is that instead of the ad-hoc mechanisms used in current routers we can build programmable networks using proper computer science abstractions. This technology is now at the <b>startup</b> <b>stage,</b> and is being deployed in the data centres of large web service firms. We are interested in protecting a future SDN. The current designs follow traditional security assumptions and do not consider many likely deployment scenarios. We discuss how SDN architecture can be structured to offer more security, the auxiliary services that such a network will require and the advantages that it can offer. ...|$|E
40|$|The key {{question}} raised {{in this research}} in progress paper is whether the development stage of a (hardware) startup can give {{an indication of the}} crowdfunding type it decides to choose. Throughout the paper, I empirically investigate the German crowdfunding landscape and link it to startups in the hardware sector, picking up the proposed notion of an emergent hardware renaissance. To identify the potential points of contact between crowdfunds and startups, an evaluation of different <b>startup</b> <b>stage</b> models with regard to funding requirements is provided, as is an overview of currently used crowdfunding typologies. The example of two crowdfunding platforms (donation and non-monetary reward crowdfunding vs. equity-based crowdfunding) and their respective hardware projects and startups is used to highlight the potential of this research in progress...|$|E
