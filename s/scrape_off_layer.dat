50|$|Research on {{detached}} plasma {{and on its}} recombination modes is {{of primary}} importance in order to design an appropriate divertor region in a future nuclear fusion power plant, where huge amounts of energy will be deposited by the fast-moving particles generated in the main reactor. The major goal of the ULS as for many other linear divertor simulators, is to reproduce the same temperature and density conditions of the SOL (<b>Scrape</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Layer)</b> of a tokamak in a linear environment and therefore to make easier the study of its properties.|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of L-mode plasma turbulence in the <b>Scrape</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Layer</b> of MAST are presented. Relevant {{features of the}} boundary plasma, such as {{the thickness of the}} density layer or the statistics of the fluctuations are related to the edge density and temperature, plasma current and parallel connection length. It is found that the density profile is weakly affected by the edge density, it broadens when the current or the temperature are decreased while the connection length has the opposite effect. The statistics of the turbulence is relatively insensitive to variations of all the edge parameters and show a certain degree of universality. Effective transport coefficients are calculated for several plasma conditions and display a strong nonlinear dependence on the parameters and on the radial variable. Finally, it is shown how the perpendicular particle fluxes in the <b>Scrape</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Layer</b> are related to the edge parameters. Comment: 21 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between turbulent transport and <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> <b>layer</b> width is investigated in circular plasmas toroidally limited {{on the inner}} wall. A broad range of experimental observations collected in the Tore Supra <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> <b>layer</b> are detailed and compared to turbulent interchange models. Blob velocities agree reasonably well with an analytical model derived for isolated blobs. A set of 2 D isothermal turbulence simulations are used to derive a scaling law for the density width. Quantitative agreement is found between this model scaling and experimental density width measured in Tore Supra, over a large set of plasma conditions. The sensitivity to control parameters (major radius, safety factor and normalized Larmor radius) is roughly explained by {{the sensitivity of the}} blob velocity model. The predictions are also extended to power decay length in limited plasma configurations. For ITER start-up phases, the predicted power decay length fall in the range of extrapolations based on multi-machine regressions...|$|E

Detailed {{comparison}} between fluctuation characteristics at high-field-side (HFS) and low-field-side (LFS) <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> <b>layers</b> (SOLs) has been made, {{for the first}} time, in the L mode plasma of JT- 60 U tokamak using reciprocating Langumuir probes. Statistical analysis based on probability distribution function (PDF) was employed to describe intermittent (non-diffusion) transport in SOL plasma fluctuations. It {{was found that the}} positive bursty events appeared most frequently at LFS midplane associated with blobby plasma transport, then the PDF is strongly skewed positively, while the PDF in HFS SOL is close to Gaussian distribution. Conditional averaging analysis of the positive bursty events at LFS midplane indicates the intermittent feature with a rapid increase and a slow decay {{is similar to that of}} plasma blobs theoretically predicted. Statistical self-similarity was also investigated with Fourier power spectrum, and statistics of waiting-time and duration-time of the fluctuation. It was found, for the first time, that clear statistical self-similarity was observed at LFS SOL, showing fractal property of the fluctuation. The scaling exponent of duration time statistics disagrees with the predictions for the self-organized criticality (SOC) paradigm...|$|R

For the first time, fast measurements of heat loads on the main chamber plasma facing components (about 1 ms time resolution) are analysed. The timescale of energy deposition during the thermal quench is estimated and compared with timescale of the core plasma collapse measured with soft X-ray. The energy deposition time is 3 - 7 times longer than the plasma energy collapse during density limit disruptions or radiative limit disruptions. This factor is rather in the range 1. 5 - 6 for vertical displacement events. The heat load profiles measured during the thermal quench show substantial broadening of the power footprint on the upper dump plate.

50|$|As {{of early}} 2013, the parties {{involved}} are revolving around three main ideas to remediate sediment: wet dredging, dry dredging, or an engineered shoreline. Wet dredging is using a bucket or claw like scoop to bring up tons of sediment from the lake floor. In dry dredging, an artificial barrier is built around the region to be worked on, then pumped dry. Then workers <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> the top <b>layers,</b> and when they're done they remove the barrier. The engineered shoreline remedy would involve wet dredging the sediments further from shore and placing them near-shore, creating new land for redevelopment of the waterfront. The cost range of these plans is from $35 million to $77 million.|$|R

In quasi-steady state with plasma current I_p ≈ 20 kA, sawtooth-like oscillation of I_p with 20 Hz occurs spontaneously.

50|$|The {{layers of}} {{sedimentary}} rock show {{evidence of a}} deep-sea fan. A deep-sea fan is caused when there is dense, turbulent sediment filled water flowing down a submarine canyon. This highly dense water is called a turbidity current. Something that may cause a turbidity current are earthquakes or storms that create a submarine slide. When this sediment filled water leaves {{the end of the}} canyon it spreads out in a fan like shape. The sediment is thinner and thinner the farther away the sediment is from the submarine canyon. All of these layers of sedimentary rock are created thousands of feet below the ocean’s surface but now the layers are visible above the surface of the water. This is because the Pacific plate and the North American plate are moving against each other; since the oceanic plate is lower, it is being forced below the continental plate in a process called subduction. While the oceanic plate is being subducted, the continental plate is <b>scraping</b> <b>off</b> the top <b>layers</b> of the oceanic plate slowly bringing them to the surface.|$|R

The effect of axisymmetric fields on the field structure is also determined. In divertor tokamaks, the connection length also has logarithmic properties near the separatrix. Even when the perturbations, which resonate to rational surfaces near the plasma boundary, are added, Iogarithmic properties still remain. We compare the connection length of torsatron/helical-heliotron systems with that of divertor tokamaks.

30|$|In {{a second}} situation, {{suggested}} by terrestrial landslides collapsing onto glaciers, ice {{existed in the}} form of a large glacier-like body. The diffusion rate of ice sublimating in the Martian atmosphere decreases considerably if ice is protected by rock rather than being directly exposed to the atmosphere (Mellon and Jakosky 1993). If sublimation is small, ice underneath a protective rock layer might persist for a geologically long time (Clifford and Hillel 1983; Mellon et al. 1997). However, in this case, a series of questions arise as to the dynamics of a landslide on debris-covered ice. How then does the ice lubricate the slides? Is the protective rocky layer thin enough to be negligible with respect to the lubrication effect? A possible answer could be that this layer would be easily removed by the immense shear stress exerted by a thick landslide, which after <b>scraping</b> the <b>layer</b> <b>off</b> would essentially travel on bare ice.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this letter}} we present {{evidence}} that intermittent transport observed in nature, e. g., the <b>scrape</b> <b>off</b> <b>layer</b> of magnetically confined plasma devices, {{has a strong}} signature of determinism. We show that the universal distribution of density fluctuation {{as well as the}} unique parabolic relation between skewness and kurtosis observed in experimental data can be obtained by a superposition of stochastic and deterministic events. A well known deterministic effect, namely, the loss of transversal stability of periodic orbits embedded in an invariant (inertial) manifold is used to model the spiky nature of the emissions. The intermittent emissions are proposed to be due to local unstable transversal directions of the invariant manifold resulting in an ejection of particles and a consequent burst in the signal. We show that characteristics observed by the emissions namely an impulsive ejection followed by a slow recovery phase can be directly related to the deterministic mechanism proposed...|$|E

40|$|West-directed {{subduction}} zones show east-verging arcs of 1500 – 3000 km. They {{are usually}} younger than 50 Ma and {{are characterized by}} a frontal accretionary wedge and a back-arc basin propagating together toward the east. The accretionary wedge <b>scrapes</b> <b>off</b> superficial <b>layers</b> of the downgoing plate (thin-skinned tectonics) whereas the back-arc extension cross-cuts the entire subduction hanging wall (thick-skinned tectonics). The slab {{of this type of}} subduction is steep to vertical and the hanging wall of the subduction has a mean elevation of 1000 m below sea level. Trenches and foredeeps are the deepest basins of the Earth and the mean depth is of 5000 m below sea level. West-directed subduction occurs both in case of the highest E-W convergence rates among plates (e. g. W Pacific examples) and no or very low convergence (e. g. Carpathians). Following Atlantic W-directed subduction examples, the W-directed subductions seem to develop along the back-thrust belt of former E-directed subduction zones, where oceanic lithosphere occur in the foreland to the east with the narrowing of the American continents. This could be applied to the onset of the Apennines subduction along the back-thrust belt of the Alpine-Betic orogen where Tethys oceanic crust was present. The Alpine orogen was stretched and scattered in the Apennines back-arc basin. The back-arc extension is internally punctuated by necks (sub-basins) and boudins (horsts of continental lithosphere). Asymmetric extension in the back-arc basin appears controlled by differential drag between the eastward mantle flow and the overlying passively transported crustal remnants. Compression in the accretionary prism may be interpreted as the superficial expression of the shear occurring between the downgoing lithosphere and the horizontally moving mantle which compensates the slab roll-back. The area of the Apennines appears lower than the area of the sedimentary cover before subduction: this favours the idea that not significant crustal slices {{have been involved in the}} Apenninic accretionary prism, and the basement thrust sheets included in the western part of the belt are mainly relicts of the Alpine-Betic orogen...|$|R
