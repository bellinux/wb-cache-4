5|$|Poliovirus infects {{human cells}} by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, CD155, (also {{known as the}} {{poliovirus}} receptor (PVR)) on the cell <b>surface.</b> <b>Interaction</b> of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational change of the viral particle necessary for viral entry. Attached to the host cell membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the host cell cytoplasm, or that the virus is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis and suggests that poliovirus binds to CD155 and is taken up by endocytosis. Immediately after internalization of the particle, the viral RNA is released.|$|E
25|$|AR {{activation}} {{requires the}} formation of a functional activation function 2 (AF2) region in AR LBD that mediates the interactions between AR and various transcription cofactors. Therefore, most of the research on NTD AR antagonists focuses on peptides that may directly block the AF2 in AR LBD from protein surface. Even in bound mutant AR, NTD antagonists would be able to block the AF2 function via direct <b>surface</b> <b>interaction,</b> regardless of the ligand bound.|$|E

50|$|Both {{the normal}} {{derivative}} of the indicator and the Laplacian of the indicator {{are supported by}} surfaces rather than points. The generalisation is useful in e.g. quantum mechanics, as <b>surface</b> <b>interactions</b> can lead to boundary conditions in d > 1, while point interactions cannot. Naturally, point and <b>surface</b> <b>interactions</b> coincide for d=1. Both <b>surface</b> and point <b>interactions</b> {{have a long history}} in quantum mechanics, and there exists a sizeable literature on so-called surface delta potentials or delta-sphere <b>interactions.</b> <b>Surface</b> delta functions use the one-dimensional Dirac -function, but {{as a function of the}} radial coordinate r, e.g. δ(r−R) where R is the radius of the sphere.|$|R

Oil based cooking techniques have significant <b>surface</b> <b>interactions</b> that greatly affect the quality of the food they produce.
