40|$|Rationale: Advancing the schema {{to reduce}} waiting times and {{shortening}} {{length of stay}} requires fundamental changes to current practice in healthcare {{with an emphasis on}} treatment that is efficient, effective and high quality. The Health Service Executive launched its 2 ̆ 7 Model of Care for Pre-asessment Units 2 ̆ 7 (2014) as a guide for organisations to implement pre-admission units locally and facilitate pre-assessment as an out-patient service. This model was designed to be used in collaboration with the 2 ̆ 7 Model of Care for Elective Surgery 2 ̆ 7 (2012) which promoted Day of Surgery Admission (DOSA) and improved access to <b>scheduled</b> <b>beds.</b> Within the writer 2 ̆ 7 s organisaton, Day of surgery admissions were reaching the national target of 75...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Forecasting is an {{important}} aid {{in many areas of}} hospital management, including elective surgery <b>scheduling,</b> <b>bed</b> management, and staff resourcing. This paper describes our work in analyzing patient admission data and forecasting this data using regression techniques. Five years of Emergency Department admissions data were obtained from two hospitals with different demographic techniques. Forecasts made from regression models were compared with observed admission data over a 6 -month horizon. The best method was linear regression using 11 dummy variables to model monthly variation (MAPE= 1. 79 %). Similar performance was achieved with a 2 -year average, supporting further investigation at finer time scales. I...|$|R
40|$|Locomotion scoring was {{performed}} on 7999 cows on seven free stall dairy operations in northern New York to evaluate lameness prevalence rates. Additionally, management factors that may influence lameness prevalence rates were evaluated. These included observations of feedbunks, foot trimming <b>schedule,</b> <b>bedding</b> surface and material, footbath practices, cow comfort, overcrowding, culling records and shaker box analysis of TMR’s fed. Each herd was visited once and a locomotion score ranging from 1 (no gait abnormality) to 4 (severe lameness) was assigned to all milking cows. Cows with a score of 2 - 4 were considered clinically lame. The mean ± SD was 14. 5 ± 1. 3 %. The range was 13. 2 - 16. 1 %. With less than 3 % difference in prevalence rates among all the evaluated farms, no correlation could be made regarding the management factors evaluated and their effect on lameness prevalence...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of patients' lengths of stay in English hospitals {{is measured by}} using routinely collected data from 11 years. It {{is found to be}} well approximated by a power law distribution spanning over more than 3 decades. To explain this observation, a theoretical resource allocation model is presented. It is based on iterative long-term <b>scheduling</b> of hospital <b>beds,</b> and its main assumption is that future beds are allocated preferentially. This represents a situation where di®erent parts {{of the health care system}} compete for resources, with bargaining powers proportional to current resource levels...|$|R
40|$|Propellant {{transfer}} at an attached depot involves: (1) resupply tankers (dedicated launch {{from the}} ground or scavenging from the external tank) to resupply the depot; (2) depot storage and supply tanks (attached, free-flyer, or tethered) from which liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are transferred to fill the space-based OTV; and (3) the space-based OTV which is resupplied with cryogens from the depot. Liquid storage and supply, thermal control, and transfer/resupply requirements for an attached depot are listed, and technologies defined. The specific fluid management elements and approaches for an attached depot are enumerated. The cryogenic fluid management facility (CFMF) shuttle attached-payload test <b>bed,</b> <b>scheduled</b> for a mid- 1988 first launch, is expected to provide much of the needed technology...|$|R
2500|$|The study {{protocol}} [...] forced circadian desynchronization for 12 consecutive 28-hour days; {{participants were}} allowed 9.3 hours of <b>scheduled</b> time in <b>bed</b> and 18.7 hours of scheduled wakefulness. Performance on validated measures was evaluated ever 2 hours, beginning 2 {{hours after the}} scheduled wake time. The protocol, therefore, assessed performance when the body is normally driven to sleep (which {{is related to the}} point at which body temperature is at its lowest) relative to performance during normal waking hours, and allowed for assessment of the effects of body temperature independent of (and associated with) sleep hours and time of day. During the circadian peak ( [...] when body temperature is high), performance and alertness are high; conversely, near the circadian phase of low body temperature, performance and alertness are low. These results have been replicated in other forced desynchrony and extended wakefulness laboratory protocols.|$|R
40|$|College {{students}} {{are known for}} their variable sleep schedules. Such schedules, along with other common student practices (eg, alcohol and caffeine con-sumption), are associated with poor sleep hygiene. Researchers have demon-strated in clinical populations that improving sleep hygiene knowledge and practices is an effective treatment for insomnia. However, researchers who have examined relationships between sleep hygiene and practices in nonclin-ical samples and overall sleep quality have produced inconsistent findings, perhaps because of questionable measures. In this study, the authors used psychometrically sound instruments to examine these variables and to counter the shortcomings in previous investigations. Their findings suggest that knowledge of sleep hygiene is related to sleep practices, which, in turn, is related to overall sleep quality. The data from their regression modeling indi-cated that variable sleep <b>schedules,</b> going to <b>bed</b> thirsty, environmental noise, and worrying while falling asleep contribute to poor sleep quality.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} models to predict emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions for time and {{day of the}} year. Methods: Initial model development and validation was based on 5 years of historical data from two dissimilar hospitals, followed by subsequent validation on 27 hospitals representing 95 % of the ED presentations across the state. Forecast accuracy was assessed using the mean average percentage error (MAPE) between forecasts and observed data. The study also determined a daily sample size threshold for forecasting subgroups within the data. Results: Presentations to the ED and subsequent admissions to hospital beds are not random and can be predicted. Forecast accuracy worsened as the forecast time intervals became smaller: when forecasting monthly admissions, the best MAPE was approximately 2 %, for daily admissions, 11 %; for 4 -hourly admissions, 38 %; and for hourly admissions, 50 %. Presentations were more easily forecast than admissions (daily MAPE ∼ 7 %). When validating accuracy at additional hospitals, forecasts for urban facilities were generally more accurate than regional forecasts (accuracy is related to sample size). Subgroups within the data with more than 10 admissions or presentations per day had forecast errors statistically similar to the entire dataset. The study also included a software implementation of the models, resulting in a data dashboard for bed managers. Conclusions: Valid ED prediction tools can be generated from access to de-identified historic data, which {{may be used to}} assist elective surgery <b>scheduling</b> and <b>bed</b> management. The paper provides forecasting performance levels to guide similar studies...|$|R
30|$|Few {{guidelines}} are currently {{available to help}} researchers define “expertise” or “eliteness” as objectively {{as possible in the}} study of sport. Such imprecision in the criteria used to define participants as “elite” athletes threatens the validity of research on expertise in sport and sleep, especially given elite athletes’ unique lifestyle. As many variables as necessary have to be reported to describe the participants level of performance and training/competition schedule appropriately. Swann et al. [99] proposed a taxonomy for classifying the validity of expert samples. The following equation was proposed: “Eliteness”/expertise of athletic sample[*]=[*][(A[*]+[*]B[*]+[*]C/ 2)/ 3] x [(D[*]+[*]E)/ 2]. The taxonomy ranks participants on a continuum (score range 1 – 16) depending on five variables—i.e., athlete’s highest standard of performance (A), success at the athlete’s highest level (B), experience at the athlete’s highest level (C), competitiveness of sport in athlete’s country (D), and global competitiveness of sport (E)—and should be used in future studies on sleep in elite athletes [13, 91]. The influence of age on sleep is well documented, both in the general [100] and athlete populations [3, 36]. Age may also be a relevant factor to take into consideration in terms of the effects of sleep and circadian rhythm on athletic performance as older subjects are generally more morning oriented [101]. Age and corresponding category may {{have a profound effect on}} the athletes’ sleep <b>schedules</b> (i.e., <b>bed</b> and wake time) with a potentially harmful transition from junior delayed sleep-wake patterns to senior early morning training requirements [102]. The degree of familiarization with elite athletes’ unique lifestyle may possibly influence sleep outcomes when dealing with jet lag, unfamiliar sleep environment, and/or sleep disturbance before and after important competitions.|$|R

This was a qualitative study, involving 14 informants, Primary data were colleted by indepenth interview by using questionnaire, and the secondary {{data were collected from}} Haji hospital Makassar. This study shows that number of paramedic is still below standard concerning number of bed, doctors are not always present and no maximum services for patients. Educational background of paramedics has fulfilled the standard even though it can not guarantee the quality of paramedic in giving services to patients. In order to improve hospital service there should be Test of Competence to all paramedic in hospital.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{production}} areas in Europe for Hardy Ornamental Nursery Stocks (HONS) is located around Pistoia (Tuscany, Italy). In this area, pot ornamental crops show low water use efficiency (WUE). Main reasons of poor irrigation efficiency are both the inaccurate irrigation scheduling, which is normally based on grower’s personal experience, and the choice to group different plant species {{together in the same}} irrigation plot in order to simplify irrigation and to reduce growing costs. An efficiency-oriented approach for the management of HONS requires the use of soil/substrate moisture sensors (SMS) and/or crop evapotranspiration (ET) model to regulate irrigation frequency. In order to compare different methods for irrigation <b>scheduling</b> in container <b>beds</b> hosting four different HONS species, two experiments were carried out in the spring-summer season of 2009 and 2010 at ‘Centro Speri-mentale per il Vivaismo’ (CESPEVI), Pistoia. In particular, we tested two irrigation control methods based on SMS or ET model as compared to conventional timer scheduling. The WET sensor was used for SMS control while the ET model consisted of a composite regression model of crop ET (as function of plant height and potential evapotranspiration) along with a specific algorithm implemented in the software of an irrigation controller prototype. Scheduling irrigation by means of the WET sensor (irrigation was activated when the matric potential of substrate was less than - 5. 0 kPa) or applying ET model reduced seasonal water use respectively by 40 % and 45 %, and water runoff by 74 % and 81 % in comparison with timer control strategy, without significant effects on plant ET, growth, and commercial value at the end of growing season. Both new irrigation scheduling are useful for growers, but for a large use of RZS method, a low cost RZS sensor is required. The use ET-model is less expensive, but it requires the knowledge of the Kc for the hundred of different species grown in the nurseries...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{retrospectively}} investigate clinical outcome and potential prognostic factors after reirradiation (Re-RT) for in-field recurrence of metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC). Re-RT with 1 x 8 Gy (n = 48), 5 x 3 Gy (n = 29), 5 x 4 Gy (n = 30), 7 x 3 Gy (n = 3), 10 - 12 x 2 Gy (n = 11), or 17 x 1. 8 Gy (n = 3) was administered to 124 patients. Cumulative biologically effective dose (BED) (first course of RT plus re-RT) ranged from 77. 5 Gy(2) to 142. 6 Gy(2), and was <or= 120 Gy(2) in 114 (92 %) patients. Twelve potential prognostic factors were investigated for associations with motor function and survival. Motor function improved in 45 (36 %) patients, was stable in another 62 (50 %) patients, and deteriorated in 17 (14 %) patients. Upon multivariate analyses, the effect of Re-RT on motor function was significantly associated with the effect of the first course of RT (P =. 048), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (P =. 020), time to development of motor deficits before Re-RT (P =. 002), and visceral metastases (P <. 001). Survival was associated with ECOG performance status (P <. 001), ambulatory status before Re-RT (P <. 001), time to development of motor deficits (P =. 018), and visceral metastases (P <. 001). Re-RT dose <b>schedule</b> or cumulative <b>BED</b> had no significant impact on functional outcome or survival. Acute toxicity was mild, and late toxicity, such as radiation myelopathy, was not observed. Given the limitations of a retrospective study and the relatively short follow up after Re-RT, spinal reirradiation appeared to be effective and safe when the cumulative BED is </= 120 Gy(2). Motor function after Re-RT was associated with the effect of first irradiation, performance status, time to development of motor deficits, and visceral metastases, whereas the Re-RT schedule had no significant impac...|$|R
