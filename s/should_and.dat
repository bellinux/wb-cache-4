For decades, there has been significant disagreement between traditionalists and innovators regarding which ingredients <b>should</b> <b>and</b> should not {{be included in a}} salade niçoise. According to traditionalists, it excludes cooked vegetables. The salad may include raw red peppers, shallots, artichoke hearts and other seasonal raw vegetables. Raw green beans harvested in the spring, when they are still young and crisp, may be included. However, cooked green beans and potatoes are commonly served in variations of salade niçoise that are popular around the world.|$|E
5|$|The author {{believes}} that determinations {{of what should}} be censored from whom should not {{be made by the}} government, stressing that a society must ensure that there is a tangible negative impact on youth from certain material before imposing censorship. She writes that it becomes incredibly difficult to characterize specifically what <b>should</b> <b>and</b> should not be censored, resulting in negative overreaching consequences of censorship. Heins advises the impact on society from censorship could be so great that censors should be sure there is real actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men <b>should,</b> <b>and</b> if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

25|$|The {{belief that}} {{scientific}} theories <b>should</b> <b>and</b> do represent metaphysical reality {{is known as}} realism.

One form of anti-realism is idealism, the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality. In an idealistic world view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.|$|E

In modern Mongolia, the wolf is still seen as a good luck symbol, {{especially}} for males. In Mongolian folk medicine, eating the intestines of a wolf is said to alleviate chronic indigestion, while sprinkling food with powdered wolf rectum is said to cure hemorrhoids. Mongol mythology explains the wolf's occasional habit of surplus killing by pointing to their traditional creation story. It states that when God explained to the wolf what it <b>should</b> <b>and</b> should not eat, he told it that it may eat one sheep out of 1,000. The wolf however misunderstood and thought God said kill 1,000 sheep and eat one.|$|E

25|$|The {{management}} of atrial fibrillation (AF) {{is focused on}} preventing temporary circulatory instability and to prevent stroke and other ischemic events. Control of heart rate and rhythm are principally used to achieve the former, while anticoagulation may be employed to decrease the risk of stroke. Within the context of stroke, the discipline may {{be referred to as}} stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (SPAF). In emergencies, when circulatory collapse is imminent due to uncontrolled rapid heart rate, immediate cardioversion may be indicated. The CHADS2 score is a well-validated simple clinical prediction rule for determining the risk of stroke (and therefore who <b>should</b> <b>and</b> should not be anticoagulated with warfarin); it assigns points (totaling 0-6) depending on {{the presence or absence of}} co-morbidities such as hypertension and diabetes. In a comparison of seven prediction rules, the best was CHADS2 which performed similarly to the SPAF and Framingham prediction rules.|$|E

The King decides that he will give {{the best part of}} the kingdom to the daughter who loves him most, and asks his three daughters to state how much they love him. Goneril and Regan make hypocritical, flattering speeches, and are rewarded with a third each; Cordelia, however, cannot or will not stoop to false flattery for gain, and tells her father that she loves him as much as she <b>should,</b> <b>and</b> that she will love her husband as well if she marries. Enraged, the King disinherits and disowns his once-favourite child, and divides her portion between her two elder sisters. The loyal Earl of Kent speaks up boldly to defend Cordelia, and is banished by the furious King. The Duke of Burgundy withdraws his suit on finding Cordelia deprived of a dowry, but the King of France gladly accepts her as his bride.|$|E
