5|$|The early 18th century {{ushered in}} the rule of Kanthirava Narasaraja II, who, being both deaf and mute, ruled under the regency {{of a series of}} army chiefs (Delavoys) all of whom hailed from a <b>single</b> <b>family</b> from the village of Kalale in the Nanjangud taluk (or sub-district) of Mysore. Upon the ruler's death in 1714 at the age of 41, his son, Dodda Krishnaraja I, still two weeks shy of his 12th birthday, succeeded him.|$|E

40|$|It is {{very common}} in <b>single</b> parent <b>families</b> that various {{problems}} occurred, for example, improper educational methods used by family members and lack of guarantee of teenagers’ legal rights and so on.

Social work has great professional advantages in helping <b>single</b> parent <b>family</b> teenagers and resolving educational problems of them. This paper analyzes problems occurred during social worker intervening in <b>single</b> parent <b>family</b> teenagers’ educational problems by exploring existing issues and basic social work theories as well as combining China’s social work practice in <b>single</b> parent <b>family</b> teenagers educational problems. This paper also investigates some practical and applicable methods for resolving problems found during the study.

5|$|Four {{families}} of river dolphins (Iniidae, Pontoporiidae, Lipotidae and Platanistidae) are currently recognized, comprising three superfamilies (Inioidea, Lipotoidea and Platanistoidea). Platanistidae, containing the two subspecies of South Asian river dolphin, {{is the only}} accepted family of Platanistoidea. Previously, many taxonomists had assigned all river dolphins to a <b>single</b> <b>family,</b> Platanistidae, and treated the Ganges and Indus River dolphins as separate species. A December 2006 survey found no members of Lipotes vexillifer (commonly known as the baiji, or Chinese river dolphin) and declared the species functionally extinct. With their disappearance, one of the recently accepted superfamilies, Lipotoidea, has become extinct.|$|E

40|$|Within {{members of}} the global village, {{affluent}} or poor nations alike, the family structure has undergone a dramatic change. Taiwan is no exception. In the past, the traditional Taiwanese family secures social order by fusing social forces adhesively. However, accompanied with economic development, feminist movement and population immigration, the traditional Taiwanese family structure has undergone a dramatically change. The traditional family has faced colossal challenges; the increased unwedded mothers, sky-high divorce rate, separated family due to parents working in the both side of the Taiwan Strait. All of these contribute towards making the <b>single</b> parent <b>family</b> as a “social fact ” in the trend of Taiwan social change. Unlike other countries, the ratio of <b>single</b> parent <b>family</b> with male headed families has been relatively high in Taiwan. A 2001 nationwide survey of 3500 <b>single</b> parent <b>families</b> in Taiwan indicates that the ratio of male headed and female headed <b>single</b> parent <b>families</b> respectively is close to 1 : 1, and the economic condition has no significant difference. Furthermore, since the remarried rate of parents in the <b>single</b> parent <b>family</b> is low (in 2007 the divorce rate in Taiwan was 2. 5 / 1000, the remarried rate for male was 27. 1 / 1000, for female was 11. 2 / 1000), {{more than half of}} surveyed <b>single</b> parent <b>families</b> have lived in such structure more than five years.

5|$|The Fifth Ward Wardroom was {{constructed}} {{and used as}} a polling place and meeting hall in a critical time when Pawtucket was incorporated as a city before later {{being used as a}} school and eventually a legion post. At the time it was nominated to the National Historic Register, the house was undergoing renovations to become a private <b>single</b> <b>family</b> residence. Prior to its conversion it was the Henrietta I. Drummond Post No. 50 of the American Legion. According to public records, the house remains a private residence.|$|E
5|$|The city {{started from}} an inland town that {{extended}} to the coast. The Bairro da Matriz, whose nucleus was the centre from whence the city grew, is intersected by 14th century narrow and twisted streets lined by <b>single</b> <b>family</b> homes. The historical district has old buildings such as the sixteenth-century house in front of Matriz Church — the main church, the old Town Hall (14th century), the seventeenth century Solar dos Carneiros and house of Captain Leite Ferreira, and the eighteenth century Limas and the Coentrão Houses. The fishermen were grouped in the south coast, around Póvoa Cove (Enseada da Póvoa); The fisher district was already developed in the 18th century with its structure of narrow streets parallel to the coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of private {{buildings on the}} boulevards and surrounding areas took place later. The middle class continued to prefer living in new suburbs rather than the cramped {{areas of the city}} center. The high prices of the land (expected to finance part of the construction costs) and the high rents were not within the means of the lower classes. Life in apartments was no longer desirable for residents of Brussels, who preferred to live in <b>single</b> <b>family</b> homes. The buildings constructed by private citizens had difficulty finding buyers.|$|E

Despite this, the eggs are laid singly, a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation.|$|E

5|$|There is robust {{morphological}} {{support for}} {{the placement of the}} zebra shark, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), and the nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum, Nebrius ferrugineus, and Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum) in a single clade. However, the interrelationships between these taxa are disputed by various authors. Dingerkus (1986) suggested that the whale shark is the closest relative of the zebra shark, and proposed a <b>single</b> <b>family</b> encompassing all five species in the clade. Compagno (1988) suggested affinity between this species and either Pseudoginglymostoma or a clade containing Rhincodon, Ginglymostoma, and Nebrius. Goto (2001) placed the zebra shark as the sister group to a clade containing Rhincodon and Ginglymostoma.|$|E
5|$|Aetosauria {{was first}} named in 1889 by English naturalist Richard Lydekker and {{zoologist}} Henry Alleyne Nicholson. They considered Aetosauria {{to be one}} of three suborders of the order Crocodilia, the other two being Parasuchia (a Triassic group) and Eusuchia (a group including all post-Triassic crocodiles). At the time, Cope considered Aetosauria to belong to Rhynchocephalia, an order of reptiles that includes the living tuatara. He also thought that the tightly fitting osteoderms, which were thought to be fused to the ribs, indicated that aetosaurs were transitional between rhynchocephalians and turtles. Nicholson and Lydekker placed a <b>single</b> <b>family</b> within the suborder, Aëtosauridæ. They considered aetosaurs to be similar to living crocodilians apart from their elongated metatarsals, which were compared to those of dinosaurs. In fact, Marsh considered aetosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs because both had similar metatarsals.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans, such as sand fiddler {{crabs and}} shrimp, among the {{mangroves}} also occupy a significant {{place in the}} local economy. While {{a large number of}} shrimp species inhabit the Senegambian area, a <b>single</b> <b>family</b> exists in Casamance: Penaeidae. Southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis) are the most commonly collected. They were traditionally caught as part of local artisan fishing by men, women, and children. Shrimp collection in the area experienced significant development in the 1960s, following the establishment of European industrial units. The local fishermen switched to this method, and there was an increased presence of fishermen from other areas. A study in 2005 revealed {{the extent to which the}} shrimp population in the region has been depleted, citing multiple causes, including diminishing rainfall, over-salinization of the estuary, and poorly controlled harvesting. Along with the mangrove degradation, the civil unrest, and the inadequate fishery regulation, Casamance has had to deal with the closure in 2003 of a major industrial complex in Ziguinchor which treated and exported shrimp and other crustaceans and employed more than 2,000 people.|$|E
