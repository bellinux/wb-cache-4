40|$|Concealment of packet-loss related distortions in {{multimedia}} communications assumes {{great importance}} {{with the emergence}} of packet switched communication using the IP protocol. This paper proposes a novel temporal algorithm to conceal packet-loss related distortion in video transmission. It is based on the insight that the spatial region around the area in the previous frame that yields the best concealment will in general be highly correlated with the corresponding area around the region to be concealed in the present frame. The proposed structural alignment algorithm (SAA) consistently yields better concealment and exhibits a superior ability to align edges. We compare performance of the proposed algorithm with that of a well known <b>side</b> <b>matching</b> algorithm (SMA). Finally, we note the strengths and the weaknesses of SAA and SMA and propose a combined concealment algorithm (CCA) that uses the strengths of both, SAA and SMA for more effective concealment. With their superior concealment ability, the SAA and CAA can find application in real-time concealment of packet-loss related artifacts in streaming video. ...|$|E
40|$|Motion {{compensated}} shape {{error concealment}} Abstract — The introduction of Video Objects (VOs) {{is one of}} the innovations of MPEG- 4. The α-plane of a VO defines its shape at a given instance in time and hence determines the boundary of its texture. In packet-based networks, shape, motion, and texture are subject to loss. While there has been considerable attention paid to the concealment of texture and motion errors, little has been done in the field of shape error concealment. In this paper we propose a post-processing shape error concealment technique that uses the motion compensated boundary information of the previously received α-plane. The proposed approach is based on matching received boundary segments in the current frame to the boundary in the previous frame. This matching is achieved by finding a maximally smooth motion vector field. After the current boundary segments are matched to the previous boundary, the missing boundary pieces are reconstructed by motion compensation. Experimental results demonstrating the performance of the proposed motion compensated shape error concealment method, and comparing it with the previously proposed weighted <b>side</b> <b>matching</b> method [1] are presented.

The Selective Block Matching Algorithm (SBMA) recovers the lost blocks by incorporating the selective spatial interpolation (only selected pixels are interpolated) and the <b>side</b> <b>match</b> algorithm (SMA) to achieve smooth restoration of lost blocks. First, pixels of lost blocks that have small likelihood of being high frequency components are selected for spatial interpolation. Subsequently, a lost block {{is replaced by}} the candidate block identified based on a matching criterion.

40|$|Humans are {{the most}} {{imitative}} species on earth, but how imitation is accomplished and which {{areas of the brain}} are directly involved in different kinds of imitation is still under debate. One view is that imitation entails representing observed behaviours as a set of hierarchically organised goals, which subsequently drive the construction of an action pattern [Bekkering, H., Wohlschläger, A., and Gattis, M. (2000). Imitation of gestures in children is goal-directed. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 53, 153 - 164; Wohlschläger, A., Gattis, M., and Bekkering, H. (2003). Action generation and action perception in imitation: An instance of the ideomotor principle. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 358, 501 - 515]. On this view, when working memory resources are limited, only the goals at the top-end of the hierarchy will be accurately reproduced. In the present study, neurologically intact participants and patients with frontal and non-frontal lesions were asked to make imitative responses that were either mirror-image (e. g., the observer's right side corresponding to the model's left side) or anatomically (e. g., the observer's right side corresponding to the model's right <b>side)</b> <b>matching.</b> Experiment 1 confirmed that individuals with brain damage, though globally impaired compared with neurologically intact controls, nevertheless followed the same goal hierarchy. However, there was a selective deficit in performing anatomical imitation for the frontal group. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the problem for frontal patients stemmed from an impaired ability to remember and reproduce incompatible stimulus-response mappings, which is fundamental for the selection of the appropriate frame of reference during anatomical imitation...|$|E
30|$|There are {{numerous}} procedures used {{to hide a}} variety of multimedia secrets inside distinguished multimedia files. Anderson and Petitcolas discussed some limitations in steganography methods. They proposed an information-theoretic method using Shannon’s theory for perfect security of data [5]. Mohammad and Jantan suggested the LSB (Least Significant Bit) procedure in which one bit of secret data is substituted at the 8 th LSB position of every byte of the coated file, if the entropy and correlation values of stego image and the cover image show equality after enciphering, then it represents that the process is safe [6]. Srivastava and Mathur have proposed the effect of applying well-known steganography techniques on various statistical models of natural images. On one side, they retrieved that some popular stego-algorithms consistently bias these statistics {{for some of the}} most basic models. On the other side, the intrinsic variability of these statistics is so large, for the class of images discussed, that this bias induced by hiding “unnatural” information is not enough, in general, to transmit the results outside of the “natural” range unless the knowledge of the implanting algorithm is available and exploited [7]. Juneja and Sandhu [8] described a new LSB array-based mechanism. It combines whole LSB bits of diverse pixels as an LSB array. The encrypted message block has been mapped to LSB array. A matching process has been applied to find out the maximum matching portion for embedding secret data. Swain and Lenka [9] proposed a new steganography technique based on LSB array. The image is transformed to binary form. Four LSB arrays such as LSB 0, LSB 1, LSB 2, and LSB 3 are used. One of the four arrays is obtained and formed {{on the basis of the}} length of the secret message. For large size messages, LSB 3 array is used. The different words of the secret data are mapped on the chosen array, where maximum match is found, which obscured the data and start indices are noted down. Once a word is embedded in a particular region of the array that region is made unavailable for another word. The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt the length of each word and their start indices altogether. The cipher text is compressed and then embedded at some reserved area in the image. This reserved area was not used in forming the used LSB array. In another method, proposed by Swain and Lenka, a steganography methodology using four LSB arrays is suggested. LSB, LSB 1, LSB 2, and LSB 3 arrays are constructed. Different blocks are mapped to different LSB array and embedding will be performed at a maximum matching region of the corresponding LSB array. By this mechanism, the security and capacity have been improved [10]. Pixel value differencing method has been proposed by Wu and Tsai [11]. A cover image is used for secret data substitution using the difference values of the two-pixel blocks. A two-way block matching procedure and the hop embedding scheme is suggested to hide a secret image data inside a cover image [12]. Kumar and Roopa proposed the same block matching scheme and the hop embedding technique. They improved tamper proofing, so that any attack cannot modify the content of the embedded data in the cover image [13]. Parvez and Gutub described a steganography methodology using RGB intensity values of the pixel [14]. They suggest the concept of an indicator channel and remaining two channels to hide secret data bits. The last two bits of the indicator channel will give information about the hiding data in the other two channels. Zhang and Wang [15] found that pixel value differencing steganography is vulnerable to histogram-based attacks and suggested a modified version to enhance security. Chang and Tseng [16] proposed a new concept based on various sided <b>side</b> <b>matching</b> techniques. The two-, three-, and four-sided <b>side</b> <b>matching</b> methods use the side information of the various side neighboring pixels to take decision for data hiding. Nag et al. suggested a novel method in a steganographic system based on the affine encryption algorithm and embed the secret data at the LSB position in order to advise a solid security and imperceptible visual quality to secret data [17]. Three steganography techniques are described by Maiti et al. for hiding secrets in coated image. They have used last two least significant bits for embedding secrets in diagonal pixels of the cover image. Public key cryptography is used to encrypt the secret data asymmetrically [18]. Thiyagarajan and Aghila [19] proposed a new steganography methodology for hiding patient information inside a brain cover image using a dynamic key produced by graph  3 coloring problem. This technique ensures reversibility of original Brain image after extracting the embedded secret data from the Brain stego image.|$|E
40|$|Renewable {{generation}} sources provide {{emission free}} power production, however their intermittent nature requires more elasticity on the demand <b>side.</b> <b>Matching</b> the demand and supply with more intermittent renewable {{sources in the}} system is challenging due to their variable generation. A bulk storage media for electrical energy and a big share of time shiftable load could help solve the problem {{to a great extent}} in increasing the utilization of network resources and achieving the optimal usage of energy. Large storage could offer a worthy cushion to house fluctuations on both the generation and consumption sides. Shifting the time of use for flexible loads could offer cost savings to the end customer and support the network in dealing with critical situations. Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Storage Space Heating (SSH) have a great potential as a flexible load and storage media. For instance, EVs could draw extra power from the power grid in off-peak hours or with the excessive production from renewables. It could supply power back to the power grid in peak hours or if generation from the renewables is dropped. If penetration of EVs increase rapidly, then fulfilling their charging needs in every scenario with the existing power network and market mechanism would be challenging. The development of intelligent charging infrastructure for EVs to charge them as optimally as possible both in terms of charging cost and time is a subject of concern. Along with EVs, space heating load contributes a big share in the overall load of a household. SSH has an abundant potential as a flexible load for grid support in energy balance management. Intelligent charging control of Heat Storage (HS) could assist the grid in mitigating fluctuations on both the consumption and generation sides. This study considers the charging solutions for EVs and SSH. The main focus of this work is to suggest charging solutions for EVs for fulfilling their charging needs in every scenario. This research investigates the impact of different power tariffs on charging profiles under various simulation scenarios, to propose a demand bidding framework for rescheduling of charging and make a feasibility study on uncontrolled fast charging of EVs on highways. This thesis is a slight addition in the field of power systems engineering, especially in charging solutions for EVs and SSH in energy balance management. Elementary advantage is the customer participation in energy market. Cost effective use of energy and power network resources could be achieved. Fluctuations due to intermittent renewable generation could be mitigated. Network capacity utilization and possible expansion of the grid with the increased EV penetration is identified. ...|$|E
