We examined (1) {{the effects of}} the duration of dry storage on germination and (2) the effect of burial in soil on viability and germination of heteromorphic diaspores. Fresh harvested peripheral achenes remained dormant, while central achenes germinated at 60 %. Both achene types became non-dormant after one month of dry storage. In successive months of dry <b>storage,</b> <b>peripheral</b> achenes demonstrated a higher germination percentage than central achenes. The peripheral and central achenes showed similar temperature requirements during dry storage. A similar germination pattern was observed in both achene types, with a germination peak in March (96 % of peripheral achenes at 12, 26 and 34 o C; 90 % of central achenes at 26 and 34 o C). The germination capacity deteriorated over time. After 19 months of dry storage, both achene morphs failed to germinate at 12 oC. At a 26 o and 34 o C, the same group of achenes continued to germinate at a relatively high level. After six and seven months of soil storage, 90 - 95 % of both achene types remained alive. Dimorphic achenes were characterized by similar germination percentage (89 - 99 %) at all temperature intervals, whereas peripheral achenes exhumed in May were the fastest to germinate.

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{document}} the system design, tradeoffs {{and implementation of}} a magnetic disk controller for the IBM 2311 -type disk drive. The controller is specifically configured {{to operate in the}} chassis of an S 100 -Bus computer. Rationale behind this design concept {{comes from the fact that}} both S 100 -Bus computers and 2311 -type drives are falling in price and gaining in accessibility to the general public. The 2311 -type drive, in past years, was the industry standard for mass storage in large computer systems. Its obsolescence has drastically reduced its price. S 100 -Bus computer, considered to be a ???personal computer??? standard by many, is nevertheless used in many industrial and business applications. The availability of S 100 -Bus main frames, CPU cards, memories and peripheral controllers is well known today. The mass <b>storage</b> <b>peripheral</b> today found on most current S 100 -Bus computer is the ???floppy disk???. It will be shown that the 2311 -type drive, when mated to the disk controller documented herein, will provide 25 times the mass storage available from a ???standard??? floppy disk drive. In addition, the cost-per-drive today is directly competitive. The design is microprocessor based for overall control flexibility. A DMA channel is employed for high speed requirements and independent data transfer. The hardware design is documented with schematics and timing diagrams. Complete control software is developed, with flowcharts, for a set of primitive subroutines which interact with the hardware.

40|$|Consuming {{sufficient}} food {{to maintain}} adequate energy stores {{is critical for}} survival for all species in the animal kingdom. To ensure that this activity takes a high priority in brain function, mammalian brains have evolved several potent and inter-related neuronal circuitries that drive and control the balance between food consumption and energy expenditure, {{and this is a}} fundamental aspect of energy homeostasis. The neuronal circuitries that regulate energy balance include the hypothalamic neuropeptide Y, Agouti related peptide (NPY/AgRP) and pro-opiomelanocortin, cocain-amphetamin regulated transcript (POMC/CART) expressing neurons. NPY/AgRP neurons constitute a potent feeding system that is activated during a negative energy balance situation. This is actively opposed by the POMC/CART satiety system which is stimulated upon excess of energy <b>storage.</b> <b>Peripheral</b> hormones like Leptin, an adipocyte derived cytokine that signals starvation of the body to the brain upon down-regulation, Insulin, a pancreas derived hormone signaling glucose levels or Ghrelin, a gut secreted peptide that triggers the feeling of hunger, utilize both NPY/AgRP and POMC/Cart expressing neurons to mediate their functions. They achieve this by modifying the activity of these neurons at both the physiological and transcriptional level. To investigate the transcriptional network underlying the function of NPY/AgRP and POMC expressing neurons we identified Bsx, a homeodomain transcription factor that exerts specific expression in the orexigenic NPY/AgRP neurons of the arcuate nucleus. In order to characterize genetically the role of Bsx in the orexigenic neurons I generated two mouse strains deficient for the gene. I could show by this loss of function experiment in mice, that Bsx is required in the NPY/AgRP neurons both to maintain the expression of Npy and Agrp peptides, and to modulate spontaneous physical activity at the physiological level. In addition, mutant mice lacking Bsx can partially rescue the obesity phenotype caused by Leptin deficiency in ob/ob mutant mice. Food intake is reduced in these mice, due to the down-regulation of Npy, but the locomotory activity defect that ob/ob mice display is not rescued. These results provide evidence that the proposed relationship between levels of physical activity, resting thermogenesis, food intake and body weight can be genetically uncoupled and suggests the existence of a specific molecular control for subcomponents of energy balance regulation within subsets of hypothalamic neurons. ...|$|E

40|$|High-performance {{computing}} platforms {{have become}} critical {{in meeting the}} demands of modern computing applications. Rising performance requirements in {{a broad range of}} platforms from mobile devices to server systems combined with the proliferation of these high-performance computing platforms has increased the energy costs incurred and lead to an exigent need for improvement in platform energy efficiency. This requires infrastructure for monitoring of energy consumption and methods to reduce the platform energy costs. In this dissertation, we present a new measurement infrastructure to provide real-time event-synchronized platform energy measurements, demonstration of these energy measurement capabilities through application to network data transport and an operating system task scheduler that utilizes these energy measurements to greatly improve energy efficiency for multi-core computing platforms. The energy measurement infrastructure is integrated at the platform level and provides event-synchronized energy measurements for the complete platform along with important components such as the CPU, memory modules, secondary <b>storage,</b> <b>peripherals</b> and others. Furthermore, since modern secondary storage devices have buffering mechanisms that defer data write operations, the energy consumption of these operations is modeled and the model is integrated into the platform to characterize the impact of deferred operations. The energy measurement capabilities are demonstrated through application to network data transport where a data file is transported over a network link. The data compression scheme is dynamically selected using real-time energy measurements during transport of the data file to enable adaptation to the dynamic system and network conditions. The energy cost of transporting the data file is significantly reduced through the use of this energy aware compression algorithm. A novel task scheduler is presented and is designed to improve energy efficiency of multiprocessing platforms. It utilizes real-time energy measurements along with CPU performance monitoring units to identify inefficient tasks that suffer from co-run degradation due to resource contention. These inefficient tasks have their scheduling priority modified to avoid contention. Evaluation of the scheduler demonstrates large energy and execution time benefits on a quad-core platform...|$|R
