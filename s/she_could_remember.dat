500|$|There were {{no major}} {{difficulties}} {{during the four}} weeks of rehearsal in New York; Martin later remembered that the [...] "gypsy run-through" [...] for friends and professional associates on a bare stage was met {{with some of the}} most enthusiastic applause <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember.</b> [...] One of the few people having trouble was Pinza, who had difficulty adjusting to the constant alterations in the show – he was used to the operatic world, where a role rarely changed once learned. [...] Pinza's mispronunciations of English exasperated Logan, and driving to New Haven, Connecticut for the first week of previews, Pinza discussed with his wife the possibility of a return to the Met, where he knew audiences would welcome him. [...] She told him to let South Pacifics attendees decide for themselves. When the tryouts began in New Haven on March 7, the play was an immediate hit; the New Haven Register wrote, [...] "South Pacific should make history".|$|E
500|$|Mahalia Jackson's 1947 version {{received}} significant radio airplay, and as her popularity grew {{throughout the}} 1950s and 1960s, she often sang it at public {{events such as}} concerts at Carnegie Hall. Author James Basker states that the song has been employed by African Americans as the [...] "paradigmatic Negro spiritual" [...] because it expresses the joy felt at being delivered from slavery and worldly miseries. Anthony Heilbut, author of The Gospel Sound, states that the [...] "dangers, toils, and snares" [...] of Newton's words are a [...] "universal testimony" [...] of the African American experience. During the Civil Rights Movement and opposition to the Vietnam War, the song took on a political tone. Mahalia Jackson employed [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] for Civil Rights marchers, writing that she used it [...] "to give magical protection a charm to ward off danger, an incantation to the angels of heaven to descend... I was not sure the magic worked outside the church walls... {{in the open air}} of Mississippi. But I wasn't taking any chances." [...] Folk singer Judy Collins, who knew the song before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> learning it, witnessed Fannie Lou Hamer leading marchers in Mississippi in 1964, singing [...] "Amazing Grace". Collins also considered it a [...] of sorts, and saw its equal emotional impact on the marchers, witnesses, and law enforcement who opposed the civil rights demonstrators. According to fellow folk singer Joan Baez, {{it was one of the}} most requested songs from her audiences, but she never realized its origin as a hymn; by the time she was singing it in the 1960s she said it had [...] "developed a life of its own". It even made an appearance at the Woodstock Music Festival in 1969 during Arlo Guthrie's performance.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{years later}} she would tell Ezra Pound biographer Noel Stock that her memory of the visit [...] "was very hazy, all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> {{was that it was}} winter and she sat on a low stool near the fire and listened".|$|E
60|$|He laughed, and {{the laugh}} shocked her. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> {{ever to have}} heard Jason Jones laugh before.|$|R
50|$|Another victim, female, {{testified that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> {{the events of}} the day because she has {{suffered}} head trauma.|$|R
60|$|How {{long that}} first sleep lasted, she never knew. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only <b>remember,</b> in the after-time, that she woke instantly.|$|R
2500|$|First {{there is}} {{explicit}} or conscious memory, {{which refers to}} the conscious recollection of previous experiences. [...] An example of explicit memory is remembering what you did last weekend. [...] When it comes to an anesthetized patient, a doctor may ask the patient after undergoing general anesthesia if he or <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> hearing any distinct sounds or words while under anesthesia. [...] This approach is called a [...] "recall test" [...] because patients are asked to recall any memories they had during surgery.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 June 2017, {{during a}} Sky News interview, Abbott {{was unable to}} answer {{questions}} about the Harris report on how to protect London from terror attacks. She insisted that she had read the report, but was unable to recall any of the 127 recommendations. When asked if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> the specific recommendations, Abbott said [...] "I think it was an important review and we should act on it". Abbott also denied reports Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell were attempting to stop her from making broadcasts. The next day, Abbott withdrew citing illness at the last minute from a joint interview on Women's Hour on 6 June with her Conservative frontbench opposite number Amber Rudd also participating.|$|E
60|$|Granny Fox sighed in relief. It {{had been}} a terrible scare, the worst <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember.</b>|$|E
50|$|She {{also claimed}} that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> {{her work on}} the project nor 15 conversations with Hubbell’s father-in-law, Seth Ward.|$|R
60|$|The Duchess twirled the {{sprig of}} {{lavender}} between her fingers. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> {{ever to have}} heard her niece so much in earnest.|$|R
60|$|The lady's {{eyes were}} round with astonishment for a moment, for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> her transformation, nor imagine what had {{restored}} her to life.|$|R
60|$|Miss Bracy smiled, for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> {{instances}} when, {{after suffering}} {{much at the}} time, she had found the affront imaginary.|$|E
6000|$|Benita {{sank to the}} ground, and {{the next}} thing that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> was hearing the soft voice of Jacob Meyer, who said: ...|$|E
60|$|Puck {{led them}} {{up to her and}} bowed solemnly. Una made the best dancing-lesson curtsy <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember.</b> The lady {{answered}} with a long, deep, slow, billowy one.|$|E
60|$|She {{had hardly}} {{finished}} the scant meal when her eyes {{began to grow}} heavy. Then her brain seemed to become clouded and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>remember</b> where <b>she</b> was.|$|R
60|$|She paused again. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> {{just what}} Luella Delia Philpotts had said trust was to love. It was {{something}} extremely neat, {{but it had}} slipped her memory.|$|R
5000|$|Amnesia: {{when she}} was in one of these states <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> events or any of her own actions which took place {{when she was}} in the other state.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I? Well, I {{dreamed of}} ghosts, or {{something}} of the sort," [...] {{and she told him}} of the vision of the trees, though of the rest <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> little.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It IS {{the same}} thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the {{conversation}} dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn't much.|$|E
60|$|But Mr. Turnbull came now to meet her; {{a medical}} {{man is the}} good angel of the troubled house, and Maggie ran toward the kind old friend, whom she remembered as long as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> anything, with a trembling, {{questioning}} look.|$|E
60|$|What {{she said}} to Mrs. Nairn <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember,</b> but {{escaping}} from her she retired to her own room, to lie still and grapple with an agony of fear and contrition.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--" [...] said Mr. Truax, while Una {{took her}} pencil and awaited {{dictation}} {{with a heart}} so blithe that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>remember</b> the symbols for [...] "Yours of sixteenth instant received." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was a clear}} reason, {{her face}} said, if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>remember</b> it. [...] "Why did I--?" [...] Then as {{catching}} a light: [...] "Fancy your asking me--at this time of day!" ...|$|R
60|$|Catherine {{repeated}} the longest <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember.</b> The employment pleased both mightily. Linton would have another, {{and after that}} another, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on until the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court, returning for his dinner.|$|E
6000|$|... "The famous History?" [...] cried Anne. The {{writing and}} the {{printing}} of this Magnum Opus {{had been going on}} as long as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember.</b> All her childhood long Uncle Henry's History had been a vague and fabulous thing, often heard of and never seen.|$|E
60|$|Clorinda lived {{just across}} the road from Aunt Emmy in a tiny white house behind some huge willows. But Aunt Mary lived there too--the only {{relative}} Clorinda had, for Aunt Emmy wasn't really her aunt at all. Clorinda had always lived with Aunt Mary ever since <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I love you!" [...] she cried. <b>She</b> wished <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have <b>remembered</b> {{his first}} name. It would have rounded off the {{sentence}} neatly. In such a moment <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hardly call him [...] "Mr. Peters." [...] "You {{are the only}} man I love." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> where <b>she</b> was. First came a {{delightful}} thrill, as something very pleasant; then a horrible remembrance. This was Green Gables and they didn't want {{her because she}} wasn't a boy! ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{this seems}} likely to be true, when Enid Lakeman was asked {{for the source of}} it <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> it. It would be wise to regard it with caution until an {{original}} reference can be found.|$|R
60|$|She {{knew the}} place. A sad group of {{dilapidated}} little houses forming three {{sides of a}} paved quadrangle, with a shattered fountain and withered trees in the centre. Ever since <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember,</b> they had stood there empty, ghostly, with creaking doors and broken windows, their gardens overgrown with weeds.|$|E
60|$|And then {{suddenly}} {{she realized that}} she did, and a great wave of pity for Uncle Chris flooded over her. He was such an old dear. It must be horrible for him to have to stand there, telling her all this. She felt no sense of injury, only the discomfort of having to witness the humiliation of her oldest friend. Uncle Chris was bound up inextricably with everything in her life that was pleasant. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> him, looking exactly the same, only with a thicker and wavier crop of hair, playing with her patiently and unwearied for hours in the hot sun, a cheerful martyr. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> sitting up with him when she came home from her first grownup dance, drinking cocoa and talking and talking and talking till the birds outside sang the sun high up into the sky and it was breakfast time. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> theatres with him, and jolly little suppers afterwards; expeditions into the country, with lunches at queer old inns; days on the river, days at Hurlingham, days at Lords', days at the Academy. He had always been the same, always cheerful, always kind. He was Uncle Chris, and he would always be Uncle Chris, whatever he had done or whatever he might do. She slipped her arm in his and gave it a squeeze.|$|E
6000|$|She replied, Very {{well and}} yet very ill, since, {{although}} she never remembered sleeping more soundly in her life, she had experienced {{all sorts of}} queer dreams of which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> nothing at all, a circumstance that annoyed her much, as she was sure that they were most interesting. Then she added, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's go {{that way}} and meet them;" [...] and Nan wheeled about, and began to trot through the bushes, feeling a trifle anxious, for {{there were so many}} cow-paths all about <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> which way they came.|$|R
6000|$|The Princess was surprised, and, if {{the truth}} must be told, very much delighted at the {{appearance}} of this charming page, whom <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> to have seen before. Thinking he might belong to the household of the Duchess, she said: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} she played again with the flowers in the warm sunshine, and so many days passed by. Gerda knew every flower, but {{although}} there were so many, {{it seemed to her}} as if one were not there, though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> which.|$|R
