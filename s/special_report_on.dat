500|$|The Financial Times <b>special</b> <b>report</b> <b>on</b> {{the future}} of the European Union argues that the {{liberalization}} of labour markets has allowed Greece to narrow the cost-competitiveness gap with other southern eurozone countries by approximately 50% over the past two years. This has been achieved primary through wage reductions, though businesses have reacted positively. The opening of product and service markets is proving tough because interest groups are slowing reforms. The biggest challenge for Greece is to overhaul the tax administration with a significant part of annually assessed taxes not paid. Poul Thomsen, the IMF official who heads the bailout mission in Greece, stated that [...] "in structural terms, Greece is more than halfway there".|$|E

500|$|On May 19, 2006 {{the court}} ruled that the city had to release the <b>special</b> <b>report</b> <b>on</b> torture accusations, as there was a {{compelling}} public interest in the material. [...] Previous police investigations had not been publicly released. On June 20, 2006, the Illinois Supreme Court unblocked the release of the special report by Egan, which took 4 years and cost $17 million. In the end the group evaluated 148 cases. [...] The investigation revealed that in three of the cases, prosecutors could have proved, beyond a reasonable doubt in court, that torture by the police had occurred; [...] five former officers including Burge were involved. Half of the claims were deemed credible, but because the timing of the cases exceeded the statute of limitations for police abuse of suspects, no indictments were made.|$|E
500|$|The Chrysler Building {{also appears}} in many photo shoots. In December 1929, Walter Chrysler hired the {{photographer}} Margaret Bourke-White {{to take pictures}} of the building for publicity purposes. She took the images from a scaffold [...] meters high and worked at a studio at ground level until she was evicted in 1934. According to one account, Bourke-White wanted to live in the building {{for the duration of the}} photo shoot, but the only person who could actually live in the building was the janitor, so she was relegated to co-leasing a studio instead with Time Inc. In 1930, several of her photographs were used in a <b>special</b> <b>report</b> <b>on</b> skyscrapers in the then-new Fortune magazine. In 1934, Bourke-White's partner Oscar Graubner took a famous photo called [...] "Margaret Bourke-White atop the Chrysler Building", which depicts her taking a photo of the city's skyline while sitting on the 61st-floor eagle ornaments. On October 5, 1998, Christie's auctioned the photograph for $96,000. In addition, during a January 1931 dance organized by the Society of Beaux-Arts, six architects, including Van Alen, were photographed while wearing costumes resembling the buildings that each architect designed.|$|E
