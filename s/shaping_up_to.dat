500|$|When Fight Club premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival, {{the film}} was {{fiercely}} debated by critics. A newspaper reported, [...] "Many loved and hated it in equal measures." [...] Some critics {{expressed concern that the}} film would incite copycat behavior, such as that seen after A Clockwork Orange debuted in Britain nearly three decades previously. Upon the film's theatrical release, The Times reported the reaction: [...] "It touched a nerve in the male psyche that was debated in newspapers across the world." [...] Although the film's makers called Fight Club [...] "an accurate portrayal of men in the 1990s," [...] some critics called it [...] "irresponsible and appalling". Writing for the Australian newspaper, Christopher Goodwin stated: [...] "Fight Club is <b>shaping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> be the most contentious mainstream Hollywood meditation on violence since Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange." ...|$|E

However, both Carl Williott and Mike Wass were disappointed, with the latter claiming: [...] "this era is <b>shaping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> be even worse than I imagined." [...] It ultimately received an average score of 6.1/10 from the writers. Similarly, Bowman from the same website called it one of Joannes [...] "more forgettable tracks". Although The Atlantics Spencer Kornhaber found it to be a [...] "sturdily crafted" [...] single, he found Gaga to be neglectful of the song's details and claimed that American singer Taylor Swift could excel exceptionally better at the same craft.|$|E

He enjoyed the deaf choir's rendition of [...] "Imagine", but wished that New Directions had not interrupted and joined in with them. Mike Hale of The New York Times also disapproved of New Directions joining in with the deaf choir, writing that [...] "Imagine": [...] "was <b>shaping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> be the best thing in the episode" [...] until New Directions [...] "torpedoed the moment." [...] Liz Pardue of Zap2it felt that with [...] "Hairography" [...] Glee [...] "wasn't at its best", deeming the writing less sharp than usual and observing that the pregnancy storyline dulled the episode for her. Pardue felt that New Directions were [...] "butting in" [...] to the Haverbrook performance of [...] "Imagine", which she found [...] "a little insulting", observing: [...] "Good intentions, but cringe-y outcome." [...] Pardue also criticized the mash-up of [...] "Hair" [...] and [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] as [...] "hideous".|$|E

He thought it started out with [...] "arguably the most impressive opener to any Doctor Who yet" [...] and also praised Amy for being [...] "cheerfully free of the emotional baggage that mired her predecessors" [...] so far. Matt Wales of IGN gave the episode a 10 out of 10 rating, calling it [...] "huge, silly, scary, gorgeous, gripping and– most importantly– fun". Although he wrote it [...] "never quite matched the relentless tension of 'Blink'", he commented that it was [...] "flawlessly paced and, when it mattered, genuinely scary". Unlike Fuller, he praised the TARDIS [...] "vworp vworp" [...] joke, asking [...] "Who could possibly not love the sheer audacity in suggesting the TARDIS's iconic whirring noise {{was the result of}} the Doctor leaving the brakes on for the last 45 years?" ...|$|E

Jay Black of TV Squad said the conflict between Michael and his co-workers was very good, and he enjoys the way Phyllis revealed how hurt she was by Michael's departure from the company; however, Black said he did not like that the episode included a [...] "Casual Friday" [...] even though the office had never had one before. Rick Porter of Zap2it said the supporting characters {{were all in}} top form and that the episode demonstrated how Michael, in offering a genuine apology, has grown this season.

[...] However, he praised Mars, which according to him, [...] "nobody puts a song like this over quite like him, and when he hits the big high note on the song’s bridge, it’s about as striking a moment as you’re likely to hear on a pop record this year. It might be a little too perfect to be as devastating as a song like 'Someone Like You', but it might be a big hit just the same, and it’s guaranteed to absolutely slay in a live set." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was positive, writing that [...] "Old-school charm still gets Mars the furthest, and the best thing here is the classic torch song 'When I Was Your Man', which finds him at the piano listing all the ways he wronged an ex. 'Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life,' he cries in his Sinatra-smooth tenor, oozing charm. Maybe he's a jerk. But he's the jerk that girl's going home with tonight." ...|$|E

[...] Republican candidates openly praised Hayek and Ludwig von Mises. According to Rattner, while the Democrats economic strategy remained largely based on Keynes, the economist's name was now rarely mentioned; [...] "Keynes" [...] had become an almost politically toxic word due to the extensive criticism of the 2009 Keynesian stimulus. Rattner refers to the work of Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi, which determined that the 2009 US stimulus saved about 8.5 million jobs, and with Obama's [...] third stimulus, a $450 billion Jobs plan was projected to create 1.9 million jobs in 2012.|$|E

[...] As {{a result of the}} move, the studio was not able to use the Toronto International Film Festival as a platform for the film's release, but it was released before a cluster of films similarly vying for awards.
