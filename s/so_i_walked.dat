'Well--it {{struck me}} that, as I spoke in Gothic, the boy {{might not have}} {{understood}} me, being a Greek. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> in at the door, to save questions, and see for myself. And there a fellow held out his hand--I suppose for money, So I gave him two or three gold pieces, and a box on the ear, at which he tumbled down, of course, but seemed very well satisfied. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> in.' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was not so}} much a reproach as {{an irresistible}} {{thinking}} aloud. Well! I thought I would give up that point too. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> a little further with Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.|$|E
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be no help for it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> along with them. Had there been the {{slightest}} chance offered to escape I would have taken it, but warned by experience, all six kept close watch over me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Most remarkable!" [...] {{said the}} young hypocrite. [...] "You see, I haven't {{anything}} to do yet, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> about London a good deal. It was a lucky chance that sent me in this direction." ...|$|R
5000|$|I don't need (my car). My {{apartment}} is {{just over a}} mile from my office, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> every day... <b>I</b> think I might give it to my parents... Leslie Norrington, quoted in Scientific American, 2013 ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> up the street--'twas a saunter [...] A {{score of}} years back, when I strolled [...] From this door; and our talk was all banter [...] Those days when {{her hair was}} of gold, [...] And the sea-fog less searching and cold.|$|R
60|$|I did {{not hear}} the reply, because of the faint rustle of my own movements. Clearly these people were all too much {{occupied}} by the battle to look in my direction, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> now straight toward the darkness that held Nettie and the black desire of my heart.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{never turned}} up,' {{answered}} Susie irritably. 'I can't understand it. I waited till the train came in, {{but there was}} no sign of her. Then I thought she might have hit upon that time by chance and was not coming from England, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> about the station for half an hour.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I walked {{round with}} Cowles {{in order to}} see the ladies home. He walked in front with Mrs. Merton, and I found myself behind with the young lady. For a minute or <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> beside her without making any remark, and then I {{suddenly}} blurted out, in a manner which must have seemed somewhat brusque to her-- ...|$|E
60|$|I do not {{question}} but many good men have writ more largely of this matter: but as I {{have not seen}} their books, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> not by their rules. If I mistake, the mistakes are only mine; and if I shall merit shame, I alone must bear it.|$|R
500|$|A short secco recitative expresses [...] "" [...] (Thus Your Spirit {{will guide}} me, <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> {{on the right}} path).|$|R
6000|$|... "'Mr. Kennedy {{is not the}} boy to sit {{quiet in}} prison, if he can see any {{possible}} way of slipping out of it. His head is crammed full of ideas. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> will <b>walk</b> near and investigate the matter.' ...|$|R
60|$|Kite and {{revolver}} {{had gone}} now, {{and all my}} hot and narrow past, its last vestiges had shriveled and vanished in the whirling gusts of the Beltane fires. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> through a world of gray ashes at last, back to the great house in which the dead, deserted image of my dear lost mother lay.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> on, {{and entered}} the church, where I soon found a seat. No Indian, red as a deer, could have startled the simple people more. They gazed and they gazed; but as I was all {{attention}} to the sermon, and conducted myself with perfect propriety, they did not expel me, as at first I almost imagined they might.|$|E
60|$|I went to {{the meeting}} of the Commissioners;[435] there was none to-day. The {{carriage}} had set me down; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> from the college in one of the sourest and most unsocial days which I ever felt. Why should I have liked this? I do not know; it is my dogged humour to yield little to external circumstances. Sent an excuse to the Royal Society, however.|$|E
40|$|Sheet {{music for}} "I Shall Walk Proudly;" the poem {{was written by}} Arthur Sampley and the music is by Gerhardt Dorn. The lyrics say "I shall/ walk proudly through these lonely/ ways because <b>I</b> once <b>walked</b> proudly by your side/ not even death can rob me of the bride whose beauty/ made man love and woman praise. I wear with pride the/ splendor that you shed upon my days. / So walks a warrior's steed behind the pall and so the aide behind the/ nation's head and so the bridesmaid to the wedding strain,/ and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk,</b> who, having lost my all,/ go with the valiant bearing {{of the dead and}} wear, like her, the/ smile above the pain. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If the {{difference}} be very marked they do. For instance, I needn't wear a hideous long bit of cloth {{over my face}} in Constantinople because I am a woman. But when the discrepancies are small, {{then they have to}} be attended to. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> shan't <b>walk</b> about with you any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm Mayre Griffith, but ever'body {{calls me}} 'Trot.' I's a {{nickname}} I got when I was a baby, 'cause <b>I</b> trotted <b>so</b> fast when <b>I</b> <b>walked,</b> an' {{it seems to}} stick. What's YOUR name?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{closed the}} door behind me, and then, for an instant, I heard him talking in a low voice of {{concentrated}} passion to his wife. This gross breach of hospitality had evidently hit upon his tenderest point. I am no eavesdropper, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> out on to the lawn. Presently I heard a hurried step behind me, and there was the lady, her face pale with excitement, and her eyes red with tears.|$|E
60|$|It was broad daylight. A pale March {{sunshine}} {{was beating}} {{down upon the}} cobbled streets, and passers-by were plentiful. There was no fingering of hilts or talk of skewering on either side. Nor must I show any of the anger that was boiling in me. My face was too well known in Madrid streets, and a Secretary of State does not parade emotions to the rabble. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> stiff and dignified amain, that dog in step with me the while.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> up to Cubby with {{a manner}} more bold than sincere. He had not eaten anything, {{but he had}} drunk the water we had left for him. To my {{surprise}} he made no fuss when I untied the rope; on the other hand, he seemed to look pleased, and I thought I detected a cunning gleam in his little eyes. He paddled away down the canyon, and, as {{this was in the}} direction we wanted to go, I gave him slack rope and followed.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Come in!' said a voice; <b>so</b> in <b>I</b> <b>walked,</b> {{and found}} myself in a very {{beautiful}} room, lighted by forty-eight fireflies, which sat in a row on a rail running all around the apartment. In {{the center of the}} room was a table, made of clay and painted in bright colors; and seated at this table, with his spectacles on his nose, was the famous Doctor Prairiedog, engaged in eating a dish of stewed snails.|$|R
3000|$|... “I {{have to be}} able to <b>walk</b> to work, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> {{told myself}} <b>walk</b> 1000 steps today, 2000 tomorrow… I set goals for myself…. I have an idea that my willpower is important. If you are {{determined}} to recover, you’ll recover more easily”. (Female, 55).|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{sidewalk}} {{is hardly}} {{wide enough for}} three, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> will <b>walk</b> behind; but keep the talk going, keep the talk going, there's no time to lose, {{and you may be}} sure I will do my share." [...] He ranged himself behind us, and straightway that stately snow-white young fellow closed up to the sidewalk alongside him, fetched him a cordial slap on the shoulder with his broad palm, and sung out with a hearty cheeriness: ...|$|R
60|$|And then I {{walked out}} of the room. After all, what was the use of saying anything? And what could I say that would have done me any service? If they were capable of {{thinking}} me a thief,--which they certainly did,--nothing that I could say would remove the impression. Nor, as I thought, was it suitable that I should defend myself from such an imputation. What were the Greenes to me? <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> slowly out of the room, and never again saw one of the family from that day to this.|$|E
6000|$|I {{saw that}} I was too calm; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> {{the room a}} while and worked myself into a high excitement; but the book's next remark --that the adventurer must get up {{at two in the}} morning--came as near as {{anything}} to flatting it all out again. However, I reinforced it, and read on, about how Mr. Hinchliff dressed by candle-light and was [...] "soon down among the guides, who were bustling about in the passage, packing provisions, and making every preparation for the start"; and how he glanced out into the cold clear night and saw that-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, may I be d----d--begging your reverence's pardon--if this isn't as cold a {{night as}} I'd {{wish to be}} out in, and as dark as my hat. I say, Thady, this'll be the night for the boys to be running a drop of the stuff; there'd be no seeing the smoke now, anyhow. I was dining early at Carrick, and was getting away home as quick as I could, and my mare threw a shoe, luckily just {{opposite}} the forge down there; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> up here, Father John, and I told them to bring the mare up when she's shod." ...|$|E
60|$|The sun was {{powerful}} when I reached the summit, and <b>I</b> was <b>so</b> warm that <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> about barefoot {{on the frozen}} snow without inconvenience, preferring it to continuing in wet stockings: the temperature {{at the time was}} 29.5 degrees, with a brisk south-east moist wind, and the dew point 22.8 degrees.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{has broken}} my jaw, <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> can't open my mouth. You will notice that my voice sounds rather harsh and husky, because I {{have to talk}} with my teeth set close together. Another bullet broke my left wing, <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> can't fly; and still another broke my right leg, <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> can't <b>walk.</b> It was the most {{careless}} shot I ever heard of!" ...|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{the shadow}} of the night had fallen, we set forth again, at first with the same caution, but {{presently}} with more boldness, standing our full height and stepping out at a good pace of walking. The way was very intricate, lying up the steep sides of mountains and along the brows of cliffs; clouds had come in with the sunset, and the night was dark and cool; <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> without much fatigue, but in continual fear of falling and rolling down the mountains, and with no guess at our direction.|$|R
60|$|The {{rest of the}} {{two dollars}} and a half I laid out that very morning in buying a red woolen shirt near Catharine Market, a {{tarpaulin}} hat, which I got at an out-door stand near Peck Slip, a belt and jackknife, {{and two or three}} trifles. After these purchases, I had only one penny left, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> out {{to the end of the}} pier, and threw the penny into the water. The reason why I did this, was because I somehow felt almost desperate again, and didn't care what became of me. But if the penny had been a dollar, I would have kept it.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried the}} door. With a groan and a shriek it gave way, {{disclosing}} the blackness inside. We started back involuntarily. I looked at Nick, and Nick at me. He was very pale, and so must I have been. But {{such was the}} respect we each held for the other's courage that neither dared flinch. And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> in, although {{it seemed as if}} my shirt was made of needle points and my hair stood on end. The crackings of the old floor were to me like the shots in Charlestown Bay. Our hearts beating wildly, we made our way into a farther room. It was like walking into the beyond.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard the}} old woman {{screaming}} after me, but I did not stop nor turn round. I don't think I could, for my heart was very full; and if I had gone back again, I should never have {{had the courage to}} go away. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> a long, long way, until night fell; and I thought of poor mother coming home from mass, and not finding me; and little Pierre shouting out, in his clear voice, for Beatrice to bring him his supper. I think I should like to have died that night, and I thought I should too; for when I was obliged to throw myself on the cold, hard ground, my feet were too torn and weary to bear me any further.|$|E
500|$|The {{themes of}} the album are {{reflected}} in the album cover designed by Alexander McQueen. Björk approached McQueen explaining to him the person who wrote Homogenics songs was someone who [...] "had to become a warrior. A warrior who had to fight not with weapons, but with love. I had 10 kilos of hair on my head, and special contact lenses and a manicure that prevented me from eating with my fingers, and gaffer tape around my waist and high clogs <b>so</b> <b>I</b> couldn't <b>walk</b> easily".|$|R
5000|$|When I Iistened to him, {{something}} funny {{happened to me}} - a peculiar kind of {{feeling that he was}} describing my state and not his state. Why did I want to know his state? He was describing something, some movements, some awareness, some silence - [...] "In that silence there is no mind; there is action" [...] - all kinds of things. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> am in that state. What the hell have I been doing these 30 or 40 years, listening to all these people and struggling, wanting to understand his state or the state of somebody else, Buddha or Jesus? I am in that state. Now I am in that state. <b>So,</b> then <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> out of the tent and never looked back.|$|R
6000|$|Takahashi {{passed from}} concern to grief {{over what he}} {{considered}} my bad luck: [...] "My goodnish! No see bear to-day?... Maybe more better luck to-morrow." [...] If I could have had some of Takahashi's luck I would scarcely have needed to leave camp. He borrowed Nielsen's 30-40 rifle and went hunting without ever having shot it. He rode the little buckskin mustang, that, remarkable to state, had not yet thrown him or kicked him. And on that occasion he led the mustang back to camp with a fine two-point buck on the saddle. [...] "Camp need fresh meat," [...] said the Jap, with his broad smile. [...] "I go hunt. Ride along old road. Soon nice fat deer walk out from bush. Twenty steps away--maybe. I get off. I no want kill deer <b>so</b> close, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> on him. Deer he no scared. He jump off few steps--stick up his ears--look at horse all same like he thought him deer too. I no aim gun from shoulder. I just shoot. No good. Deer he run. I aim then--way front of him--shoot--deer he drop right down dead.... Aw, easy to get deer!" ...|$|R
