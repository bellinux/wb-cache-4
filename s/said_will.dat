25|$|Many {{magazines}} {{began in}} Tamil Nadu during the 1920s and '30s. The humour magazine Ananda Vikatan started by S.S.

It is still running successfully after 80 years and the Vikatan group today also publishes Chutti Vikatan, Junior Vikatan, Motor Vikatan and other special interest magazines. R. Krishnamurthy serialised his short stories and novels in Ananda Vikatan and eventually started his own weekly Kalki. The name Kalki denotes the impending tenth Avatar of Lord Vishnu in the Hindu religion, who it is <b>said,</b> <b>will</b> bring to an end the Kali Yuga and reinstate Dharma or righteoueness among the worldly beings. He used the name because he wanted to bring about liberation of India.|$|E

Back home in Ainola in September, he told his sister that he was [...] "writing a new work, which {{will be sent to}} America. It will still need time. But it will turn out well." [...] In December 1928, however, when his Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen asked him how the work was developing, Sibelius was less forthcoming; the symphony existed, he said, only in his head. Thereafter Sibelius's reports of the symphony's progress became equivocal, sometimes contradictory, and difficult to follow.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were unhappy}} {{with most of}} the {{marriage}} storyline that involved Will, though they seemed satisfied with Emma's portion of it. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club <b>said</b> <b>Will</b> acted like a [...] "jackass" [...] throughout and called the storyline [...] "so pathetic and sad", words echoed by Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch, who wrote, [...] "When Schue told New Directions, 'You guys are my family,' I was a little sad for him and a lotta sad for his parents." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV proclaimed, [...] "Will desperately needs to make some grown-up friends", a sentiment echoed by HuffPost TV Crystal Bell. Lynch was critical of the scene where Will tells Emma they cannot marry because of her illness: he felt [...] "using the phrase 'it's hopeless' in reference to her mental disorder" [...] was too extreme. To James Poniewozik of Time, the episode showed [...] "how the series has squandered the opportunity to make Will into a person".|$|E

500|$|There was {{not much}} enthusiasm for the {{performance}} of [...] "Kiss". Most reviewers were not impressed with Will's falsetto: Harper said it made her ears [...] "sad" [...] and Gonzalez said it [...] "really didn't do it" [...] for her, though she did like the sections in his natural register and gave the performance a [...] "C+", and Harper noted that [...] "Holly saved the song" [...] for her. Although Futterman <b>said</b> <b>Will</b> [...] "expertly hits the falsetto notes", she didn't [...] "feel the chemistry" [...] until the final kiss. Benigno, on the other hand, said that the chemistry between them was [...] "palpable", called the cover [...] "pretty great", and gave it a [...] "B+". Roberts praised the [...] "real sex appeal" [...] Morrison brought to the number, but deemed Paltrow's tango rigid. Burns commented that white people ought to be deterred from performing Prince. He called the music [...] "uninteresting and soulless", and was dismayed that the tango was [...] "just white with white people tango dancing". Flandez, however, enjoyed their dancing and wrote, [...] "The strong holds, the slow cuts, the perfect swivel of hips and the lean-to's were mesmerizingly seductive." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Canning {{wrote that}} [...] "the writers did {{a fine job}} of {{incorporating}} the tenure, Will's terrible Spanish and the songs into the storylines", Will's lack of Spanish skills was questioned by other reviewers. Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch said this did not [...] "seem to gel with the passionate Will Schuester I remember from season 1", and Slezak expressed surprise that [...] "he hadn't even mastered the basics of the language!", as did Chaney. Slezak also <b>said</b> <b>Will,</b> as evidenced by his [...] "La Cucaracha" [...] rendition for his class, was [...] "suddenly dumb as the cardboard box that Finn winningly turned into a robot head", and Chaney commented, [...] "Mr. Schuester always seemed a bit more sensitive than this." [...] VanDerWerff wrote of [...] "the weird, dark despair {{at the heart of}} Will's plight: He's a high school Spanish teacher, and he mostly is that because he doesn't know what else to do." [...] He added, [...] "I think this was probably the best episode for the character since early season one." [...] Canning stated that [...] "the tension between Will and Emma was a welcome change", and Votta commented on the episode's less dramatic ending with Will's apology and [...] "celebrating Emma's new-found tenure with a dinner" [...] with the conclusion, [...] "sometimes you don't need a big bang to get oomph out of an episode". Chaney, however, was puzzled as to why Emma was given teaching tenure [...] "when she's been working at McKinley as a guidance counselor and handing out absolutely horrifying self-made pamphlets".|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, {{director}} Joe Johnston {{indicated that}} he planned to start filming in April 2010. In a separate interview that month, he described the film's pre-production: [...] "Rick Heinrichs is production-designing and we're set up down in Manhattan Beach, California.... We have eight or ten really talented artists, and we all just sit around all day and draw pictures and say, 'Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we could do this?' It's that phase of the production where money doesn't matter: 'Let's put all the greatest stuff up on the wall and [...] see what we can afford. The film, he <b>said,</b> <b>will</b> begin [...] "in 1942, 1943" [...] during World War II. [...] "The stuff in the '60s and '70s [...] we're sort of avoiding. We're going back to the '40s, and then forward to what they're doing with Captain America now." [...] In February 2010, Johnston stated that the Invaders will appear in [...] "the entire second half" [...] of the film, leading fans to speculate this was the World War II-era Marvel superhero team of that name, and in November Johnston refuted speculation that the Sub-Mariner, an Invaders team-member in the comics, would be included. Johnston later explained that [...] "the Invaders" [...] had been discussed simply as a possible name for the squad of commandos Captain America leads in the film. Christopher Markus, one of the screenwriters, said the unnamed group was [...] "called the Howling Commandos in the script, but no one says that out loud." ...|$|E

500|$|The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow <b>said</b> <b>Will</b> Forte's {{obsession}} with Twilight led to funny scenes, particularly an impromptu book club meeting with Tom and Donna, {{but said the}} character's efforts to impress his daughter didn't make much sense: [...] "Is there a preteen on the planet who would be anything but mortified to find her middle school buzzing with gossip about her father's Twilight-based sit-in?" [...] Steve Hesiler of The A.V. Club said the episode demonstrated how far the show has come because [...] "it was only mid-season two when Parks & Rec started producing episodes where Pawnee residents showed up two, three, or more at a time—and contributed to the larger town mythology." [...] Heisler also praised how the show could pair two seemingly random characters like Andy and Chris and make them so funny. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik called [...] "Time Capsule" [...] the weakest of the first seven third season episodes, but he said [...] "that speaks more to the high quality of the rest". Poniewozik said the episode demonstrated that, despite how bizarre the complaints of Pawnee residents are, [...] "those concerns and arguments are what makes Pawnee Pawnee". Some reviews were more negative. Matt Richenthal called [...] "Time Capsule" [...] mediocre at best, especially compared to the previous episode, [...] "Flu Season". He said the episode was too centered on the [...] "one-note joke" [...] of Will Forte's character, and that the jokes about Twilight felt dated. Richenthal wrote, [...] "Parks and Recreation features too many hilarious characters to include such a gimmick." ...|$|E
500|$|Mutchnick <b>said</b> <b>Will</b> was {{originally}} {{going to be}} named Will Herman ("her man") because the staff wanted to use names that [...] "speak exactly to the essence" [...] of the characters. However, they changed it to Truman ("true man") since {{they thought it was}} more accurate, as Will [...] "really lives his life in an honest way". John Barrowman was one of the final candidates for the role of Will, but was rejected because he [...] "wasn't gay enough". The part instead went to Eric McCormack, who revealed that taking the role was not difficult because he liked the concept of a gay show not being about the [...] "issues" [...] of being gay. Having played gay characters several times in his career, McCormack did not {{have a problem with it}} and thought his character could become a [...] "poster boy for some gay movement", like DeGeneres became a spokesperson with her character. He explained that when he first read the script, [...] "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was so much like me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and he has great friends and he's a good friend to them ... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing." [...] McCormack was also the first actor to be cast. In response to the relationship between Will and Grace, McCormak said that gay men and straight women have [...] "more fun than anybody" [...] in their relationships; [...] "Straight guys like me are jealous because of how much fun they have. We can show the audience part of that." ...|$|E

[...] Nonetheless, Buckman said that in the episode [...] "she delivered her lines capably" [...] and that her role as Liz was with [...] "admirable gusto." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker noted that the singer's appearance was [...] "one of the worst, if most fascinating, celebrity cameos I've ever witnessed." [...] Tucker said that [...] "Madonna-as-TV-actress" [...] defeated [...] "Madonna-as-movie-actress" [...] primarily because [...] "she was paired with a pro like [...] Mullally and had less screen time than she did in her most recent movie dud, Swept Away. According to David Kronke for the Whittier Daily News, [...] "Madonna may have put the kibosh on her video, but not on her guest appearance as Karen's... new best bosom buddy." [...] While Charleston Daily Mails Kevin McDonough reported that Madonna appearing on Will & Grace was [...] "clearly a reprise" [...] of singer Cher's guest stints on the episodes [...] "Gypsies, Tramps and Weed" [...] and [...] "A.I.: Artificial Insemination". McDonough wrote that the cameos made by Cher [...] "made sense", and that the latter [...] "has an ability to laugh at herself that Madonna has never exhibited." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald <b>said</b> <b>Will</b> & Grace had been [...] "guilty of some pretty poor stunt casting" [...] and included Madonna as a primary example.
