5|$|A Carmelite priory {{was founded}} in 1354, but was {{demolished}} soon after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. The site passed to various people and was used for arable farming before a workhouse {{was built on the}} <b>site</b> <b>in</b> 1857, subsequently the Friarage Hospital which takes its name from the friary was built. Following development of the <b>site</b> <b>in</b> 2006, archaeologists uncovered the remains of eight monks along with other artefacts.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} number of protein-RNA complexes in structure databases, few data resources have been made available which can be readily used in developing or testing a method for predicting either protein-binding <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> RNA sequences or RNA-binding <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> protein sequences. The problem of predicting protein-binding <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> RNA has received much less attention than the problem of predicting RNA-binding <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> protein. The data presented in this paper are related to the article entitled “PRIdictor: Protein-RNA Interaction predictor” (Tuvshinjargal et al. 2016) [1]. PRIdictor can predict protein-binding <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> RNA as well as RNA-binding <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> protein at the nucleotide- and residue-levels. This paper presents four datasets that were used to test four prediction models of PRIdictor: (1) model RP for predicting protein-binding <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> RNA from protein and RNA sequences, (2) model RaP for predicting protein-binding <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> RNA from RNA sequence alone, (3) model PR for predicting RNA-binding <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> protein from protein and RNA sequences, and (4) model PaR for predicting RNA-binding <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> protein from protein sequence alone. The datasets supplied in this article {{can be used as a}} valuable resource to evaluate and compare different methods for predicting protein-RNA binding sites...|$|R
