500|$|Known as a [...] "wash and wear" [...] dog, the Australian Cattle Dog {{requires}} little grooming, and {{an occasional}} brushing {{is all that is}} required to keep the coat clean and odour-free. Even for the show ring it needs no more than wiping down with a moist cloth. It is not a year-round <b>shedder</b> but blows its coat once a year (twice in the case of intact females) and frequent brushing and a warm bath during this period will contain the shedding hair. As with all dogs, regular attention to nails, ears and teeth will help avoid health problems.|$|E

60|$|The {{superintendent}} remained {{civil and}} impassive, {{and no one}} spoke to break the deathly hush of the silent room, filled with the appliances of ordinary business life, but tainted with the awful unexplained mark {{that there had been}} the foot of the <b>shedder</b> of blood in silence and at unawares.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} the two men stood looking at each other, yes, the <b>shedder</b> of blood and the avenger of blood stood quite still and silent, and looked {{each other in the}} eyes, as though a spell had fallen upon them {{striking}} them into stone. It was the voice of Sihamba that broke the spell, and it issued from her parched throat with a sound like the sound of a death-rattle.|$|E

Bradley was suspicious of every sound he heard, and of every face he saw, but was under a spell which very commonly falls upon the <b>shedder</b> of blood, and had no suspicion of the real danger that lurked in his life, and would have it yet. Riderhood was much in his thoughts--had never been out of his thoughts since the night-adventure of their first meeting; but Riderhood occupied a very different place there, from the place of pursuer; and Bradley {{had been at the}} pains of devising so many means of fitting that place to him, and of wedging him into it, that his mind could not compass the possibility of his occupying any other. And this is another spell against which the <b>shedder</b> of blood for ever strives in vain. There are fifty doors by which discovery may enter. With infinite pains and cunning, he double locks and bars forty-nine of them, and cannot see the fiftieth standing wide open.|$|E

40|$|A size-structured plant {{population}} model is developed {{to study the}} evolution of pathogen-induced leaf <b>shedding</b> under various environmental conditions. The evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) of the leaf <b>shedding</b> rate is determined for two scenarios: i) a constant leaf <b>shedding</b> strategy and ii) an infection load driven leaf <b>shedding</b> strategy. The model predicts that ESS leaf <b>shedding</b> rates increase with nutrient availability. No effect of plant density on the ESS leaf <b>shedding</b> rate is found even though disease severity increases with plant density. When auto-infection, that is increased infection due to spores produced on the plant itself, {{plays a key role}} in further disease increase on the plant, <b>shedding</b> leaves removes disease that would otherwise contribute to disease increase on the plant itself. Consequently leaf <b>shedding</b> responses to infections may evolve. When external infection, that is infection due to immigrant spores, is the key determinant, <b>shedding</b> a leaf does not reduce the force of infection on the leaf <b>shedding</b> plant. In this case leaf <b>shedding</b> will not evolve. Under a low external disease pressure adopting an infection driven leaf <b>shedding</b> strategy is more efficient than adopting a constant leaf <b>shedding</b> strategy, since a plant adopting an infection driven leaf <b>shedding</b> strategy does not <b>shed</b> any leaves in the absence of infection, even when leaf <b>shedding</b> rates are high. A plant adopting a constant leaf <b>shedding</b> rate <b>sheds</b> the same amount of leaves regardless of the presence of infection. Based on the results we develop two hypotheses that can be tested if the appropriate plant material is available...|$|R

60|$|After this {{extraordinary}} {{contract with the}} object of his adoration, Louis recited, apparently with deep devotion, the seven penitential psalms [the 6th, 32d, 38th, 51st, 102d, 130th, and 143d, so called from their penitential character] in Latin, and several aves and prayers especially belonging to the service of the Virgin. He then arose, satisfied that he had secured the intercession of the Saint to whom he had prayed, the rather, as he craftily reflected, that most of the sins for which he had requested her mediation on former occasions had been of a different character, and that, therefore, the Lady of Clery was less likely to consider him as a hardened and habitual <b>shedder</b> of blood than the other saints whom he had more frequently made confidants of his crimes in that respect.|$|E

5000|$|The {{simplest}} and least-expensive <b>sheds</b> {{are available}} in kit form. These kits are designed for regular {{people to be able}} to assemble themselves using commonly available tools (e.g., screwdriver). Both <b>shed</b> kits and DIY (do-it-yourself) plans are available for wooden and plastic <b>sheds.</b> <b>Sheds</b> are used to store home and garden tools and equipment such as lawn tractors, and gardening supplies. In addition, <b>sheds</b> can be used to store items that are not suitable for indoor storage, such as petrol (gasoline), pesticides, or herbicides. For homes with small gardens or modest storage needs, there are several types of very small <b>sheds.</b> The <b>sheds</b> not only use less ground area but also have a low profile less likely to obstruct the view or clash with the landscaping.These small <b>sheds</b> include corner <b>sheds,</b> which fit into a corner (3 ft tall Ã— 3 wide Ã— 2 deep, or 3 x 3 x 2 ft), vertical <b>sheds</b> (5 x 3 x 4 ft), horizontal <b>sheds</b> (3 x 5 x 4 ft), and tool <b>sheds.</b> When a <b>shed</b> is used for tool storage, shelves and hooks are often used to maximize the storage space. Gambrel-style roofed <b>sheds</b> (sometimes called baby barns), which resemble a Dutch-style barn, have a high sloping roofline which increases storage space in the [...] "loft" [...] area. Some Gambrel-styles have no loft and offer the advantage of reduced overall height. Another style of small <b>shed</b> is the saltbox-style <b>shed.</b>|$|R

60|$|Here, however, I {{suggest a}} plea for a brutal {{publicity}} only in order to emphasize {{the fact that it}} is this brutal publicity and nothing else from which women have been excluded. I also say it to emphasize the fact that the mere modern veiling of the brutality does not make the situation different, unless we openly say that we are giving the suffrage, not only because it is power but because it is not, or in other words, that women are not so much to vote as to play voting. No suffragist, I suppose, will take up that position; and a few suffragists will wholly deny that this human necessity of pains and penalties is an ugly, humiliating business, and that good motives as well as bad may have helped to keep women out of it. More than once I have remarked in these pages that female limitations may be the limits of a temple as well as of a prison, the disabilities of a priest and not of a pariah. I noted it, I think, in the case of the pontifical feminine dress. In the same way it is not evidently irrational, if men decided that a woman, like a priest, must not be a <b>shedder</b> of blood.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the finest}} {{delineation}} is undoubtedly {{the character of}} Wilhelm Tell, {{the hero of the}} Swiss Revolt, and of the present drama. In Tell are combined all the attributes of a great man, without the help of education or of great occasions to develop them. His knowledge has been gathered chiefly from his own experience, and this is bounded by his native mountains: he has had no lessons or examples of splendid virtue, no wish or opportunity to earn renown: he has grown up to manhood, a simple yeoman of the Alps, among simple yeomen; and has never aimed at being more. Yet we trace in him a deep, reflective, earnest spirit, thirsting for activity, yet bound in by the wholesome dictates of prudence; a heart benevolent, generous, unconscious alike of boasting or of fear. It is this salubrious air of rustic, unpretending honesty that forms the great beauty in Tell's character: all is native, all is genuine; he does not declaim: he dislikes to talk of noble conduct, he exhibits it. He speaks little of his freedom, because he has always enjoyed it, and feels that he can always defend it. His reasons for destroying Gessler are not drawn from jurisconsults and writers on morality, but from the everlasting instincts of Nature: the Austrian Vogt must die; because if not, the wife and children of Tell will be destroyed by him. The scene, where the peaceful but indomitable archer sits waiting for Gessler in the hollow way among the rocks of KÃ¼ssnacht, presents him in a striking light. Former scenes had shown us Tell under many amiable and attractive aspects; we knew that he was tender as well as brave, that he loved to haunt the mountain tops, and inhale in silent dreams the influence of their wild and magnificent beauty: we had seen him the most manly and warm-hearted of fathers and husbands; intrepid, modest, and decisive in the midst of peril, and venturing his life to bring help to the oppressed. But here his mind is exalted into stern solemnity; its principles of action come before us with greater clearness, in this its fiery contest. The name of murder strikes a damp across his frank and fearless spirit; while the recollection of his children and their mother proclaims emphatically that there is no remedy. Gessler must perish: Tell swore it darkly in his secret soul, when the monster forced him to aim at the head of his boy; and he will keep his oath. His thoughts wander to and fro, but his volition is unalterable; the free and peaceful mountaineer is to become a <b>shedder</b> of blood: woe to them that have made him so! ...|$|E

5000|$|Another {{method of}} flow {{measurement}} involves placing a bluff body (called a <b>shedder</b> bar) {{in the path}} of the fluid. As the fluid passes this bar, disturbances in the flow called vortices are created. The vortices trail behind the cylinder, alternatively from each side of the bluff body. This vortex trail is called the Von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n vortex street after von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n's 1912 mathematical description of the phenomenon. The frequency at which these vortices alternate sides is essentially proportional to the flow rate of the fluid. Inside, atop, or downstream of the <b>shedder</b> bar is a sensor for measuring the frequency of the vortex shedding. This sensor is often a piezoelectric crystal, which produces a small, but measurable, voltage pulse every time a vortex is created. Since the frequency of such a voltage pulse is also proportional to the fluid velocity, a volumetric flow rate is calculated using the cross sectional area of the flow meter. The frequency is measured and the flow rate is calculated by the flowmeter electronics using the equation where [...] is the frequency of the vortices, [...] the characteristic length of the bluff body, [...] is the velocity of the flow over the bluff body, and [...] is the Strouhal number, which is essentially a constant for a given body shape within its operating limits.|$|E
