First, FDBs provide autonomy to constituent databases (CDB). Autonomy means that the exported schema and management of the constituent databases are decoupled from the federation.

The 551st operated the EC-121 Constellation that were modified to conduct long-range flights over the Atlantic Ocean. Other Air Defense Command units conducting air defense missions from Otis AFB at this time included the 4707th Air Defense Wing, the 33rd Fighter Wing, and the 58th and 60th Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons.

Otis AFB served as a node in gap-filler radar and flight support. In 1959, the Air Force constructed a counterpart to the Army's Nike missiles, and CIM-10 BOMARC anti-aircraft missiles were installed on a site northwest of the airfield. Otis was one of eight such facilities in the country. The site was run by the 26th Air Defense Missile Squadron.|$|E

A car was also provided and used both for meetings and in incursions without attracting attention.

50|$|One of the {{problems}} with the VHS is poor ergonomics. The fire selector has three positions for safe, <b>semi,</b> and <b>automatic</b> fire with no 3-round burst option. Production model rifles have the selector inside the trigger guard. Changing firing modes is difficult as the crank must be rotated a long distance before either firing mode is selected. It is also for right-handed use only; the receiver can only eject shells out the right side and cases leave toward the rear sharply. There is even the chance of spent cases hitting the shooter's arm depending on elbow positioning. These are unusual features, as the non-reciprocating cocking handle is located centrally under the carrying handle and is flexible to be pulled from either side.|$|R

40|$|Effectively {{deciding}} the satisfiability of logical sentences over structures {{is an area}} well-studied {{in the case of}} finite structures. There has been growing work towards considering this question for infinite structures. In particular the theory of automatic structures, considered here, investigates structures representable by finite automata. The closure properties of finite automata lead naturally to algorithms for deciding satisfiability for some logics. The use of finite automata to investigate infinite structures has been inspired by the interplay between the theory of finite automata and the theory of semigroups. This inspiration has come in particular from the theory of automatic groups and semigroups, which considers (semi) groups with regular sets of normal forms over their generators such that generator-composition is also regular. The work presented here is a contribution to the foundational problem for automatic structures: given a class of structures, classify those members that have an automatic presentation. The classes considered here are various interesting subclasses of the class of finitely generated semigroups, as well as the class of Cayley Graphs of groups. Although similar, the theories of <b>automatic</b> (<b>semi)</b> groups and <b>automatic</b> presentation differ in their construction. A classification for finitely generated groups allows a direct comparison of the theory of automatic presentations with the theory of automatic groups...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the trend}} of {{adopting}} SOA into enterprise applications, the needs for deﬁnition and identiﬁcation of services have been recognized. There is {{a growing body of}} research carried out on the identiﬁcation of different types of services. Identifying right granularity services is important: if the service is of large size, it goes against the reusability principle of SOA, whereas if the service is of small size, then it causes unnecessary computing power for implementing any business functions. Without a formal (<b>semi)</b> - <b>automatic</b> approach to identify services, it is difficult in migrating existing systems into service-oriented systems. This paper explores the need for service identiﬁcation for service-oriented business process management systems. The current approaches, techniques and methods of service identification are reviewed, and limitations of the each approach is analysed. New requirements and techniques are demonstrated in creating improved dynamic services with consideration for interoperability, modularity, reusability within information environment...|$|R
