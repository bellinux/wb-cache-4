The subsidy allows these plaintiffs to {{exempt from the}} tax the investment yield imbedded within the structured settlement. The apparent purpose of the subsidy is to encourage physically injured plaintiffs to invest, rather than presently consume, their litigation recoveries. While the statutory subsidy by its terms is available only to physically injured tort plaintiffs, a growing structured settlement industry now contends that the same tax benefit of yield exemption is available to plaintiffs’ lawyers and non-physically injured tort plaintiffs under general, common-law tax principles. If the structured settlement industry is correct, then all tort plaintiffs and their lawyers may invest their litigation proceeds in a tax-free manner simply by using <b>structured</b> payment <b>arrangements</b> <b>Structured</b> <b>arrangements</b> would therefore be far superior to traditional tax-favored retirement accounts (e. g., 401 (k) s, IRAs), which provide the same tax benefit of yield exemption but are subject to significant constraints.

The literature revealed that many of the claims for the positive effects of CS have remained unsubstantiated. A contemporary pragmatic randomised controlled trial, summarised here, tested the relationships between Clinical Supervision, quality of care and patient outcomes, in mental health settings in Queensland, Australia. It confi rmed that benefi cial and sustainable CS outcomes accrued for Supervisors and Supervisees, as measured by a suite of research methods and instruments including The Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale©, and for patients in one private sector mental health facility. However, the effect Clinical Supervision had on nominated outcomes still remained diffi cult to demonstrate across a broad front.

In birds, the mechanisms that create these colours are diverse, but all are based on ordered arrays of melanin granules within a keratin substrate in barbules. The feathers of the grackles and allies in the family Icteridae range in appearance from matte black to iridescent. In a phylogenetic analysis of this clade, we identified several evolutionary transitions between these colour states. To describe a possible mechanistic explanation for the lability of plumage coloration, we used spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy and thin-film optical modelling of the feathers of 10 icterid species from five genera, including taxa with matte black or iridescent feathers. In matte black species, melanin was densely packed in barbules, while in iridescent species, melanin granules were arranged in ordered layers around the edges of barbules. The <b>structured</b> <b>arrangement</b> of melanin granules in iridescent species created optical interfaces, which are shown by our optical models to be critical for iridescent colour production by coherent scattering. These data imply that rearrangement of melanin granules in barbules is a mechanism for shifts between black and iridescent colours, and that the relative simplicity of this mechanism may explain the lability of plumage colour state within this group...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} reliability allocation using an aerospace system prototype. The proposed approach has been applied and compared with other traditional methods on an aerospace system prototype, where the reliability allocation process is rigorous. Design/methodology/approach – The new approach is based on integrated factors method (IFM), whose values are adjusted trough a multicriteria method, the analytic hierarchy process, depending on the importance of each factor and each unit of the system. The result is a dynamic model, that combines the advantages of the allocation method and the multicriteria decision-making technique. Findings – The reasons that led to the development of the IFM-based AHP are the outcome of a careful analysis of the current military and commercial approaches. In particular most of analyzed methods use constant weights for the factors involved in the reliability allocation; different weights are rarely assigned to these factors. Research limitations/implications – There is no limitation for implementation of A-IFM reliability allocation model in very large and complex systems, and it can therefore provide an improved <b>structured</b> <b>arrangement</b> for reliability allocation. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications – The proposed method offers several benefits compared with current military and commercial approaches. Originality/value – The computational results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach and its ability to overcome the criticalities highlighted in literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{roles of}} {{epithelial}} cells encompass both cellular- and tissue-level functions that involve numerous cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions, which ultimately mediate the highly <b>structured</b> <b>arrangement</b> of cells on a basement membrane. Although maintaining this basic structure {{is critical for}} preserving tissue integrity, plasticity in epithelial cell behavior is also critical for processes such as cell migration during development or wound repair, mitotic cell detachment, and physiological shedding. The mechanisms that mediate epithelial cell plasticity {{are only beginning to}} be understood. We previously identified Trask, a transmembrane protein that is phosphorylated by src kinases during mitosis. In this study, we report that the phosphorylation of Trask is associated with anchorage loss in epithelial cells. Phosphorylation of Trask is seen during the cell-detachment phase of mitosis, in experimentally induced interphase detachment, and during cell migration in experimental epithelial models. An analysis of human tissues shows that Trask is widely expressed in many epithelial tissues but not in most tissues of mesenchymal origin, except for a subset of early hematopoietic cells. Trask is not phosphorylated in epithelial tissues in vivo; however, its phosphorylation is seen in epithelial cells undergoing mitosis or physiological shedding. Trask is a novel epithelial membrane protein that is phosphorylated by src kinases when epithelial cells disengage from their tissue framework, identifying an important new regulator of epithelial tissue dynamics...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) the 466 pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) {{proteins}} are putative RNA-binding proteins with essential {{roles in}} organelles. Roughly {{half of the}} PPR proteins form the plant combinatorial and modular protein (PCMP) subfamily, which is land-plant specific. PCMPs exhibit a large and variable tandem repeat of a standard pattern of three PPR variant motifs. The association or not of this repeat with three non-PPR motifs at their C terminus defines four distinct classes of PCMPs. The highly <b>structured</b> <b>arrangement</b> of these motifs and the similar repartition of these arrangements in the four classes suggest precise relationships between motif organization and substrate specificity. This study {{is an attempt to}} reconstruct an evolutionary scenario of the PCMP family. We developed an innovative approach based on comparisons of the proteins at two levels: namely the succession of motifs along the protein and the amino acid sequence of the motifs. It enabled us to infer evolutionary relationships between proteins as well as between the inter- and intraprotein repeats. First, we observed a polarized elongation of the repeat from the C terminus toward the N-terminal region, suggesting local recombinations of motifs. Second, the most N-terminal PPR triple motif proved to evolve under different constraints than the remaining repeat. Altogether, the evidence indicates different evolution for the PPR region and the C-terminal one in PCMPs, which points to distinct functions for these regions. Moreover, local sequence homogeneity observed across PCMP classes may be due to interclass shuffling of motifs, or to deletions/insertions of non-PPR motifs at the C terminus...|$|E
40|$|A general method {{based on}} the {{composite}} overlapping grid approach is developed for {{the solution of the}} two-dimensional planar or axisymmetric Euler and Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes equations within geometrically complex domains. A fully automated procedure is devised to assemble the component meshes consisting of a single nonuniform Cartesian background mesh and one or more algebraically or hyperbolically generated boundary-fitted meshes. The generalized coordinate form of the flow equations is solved using a robust second-order flux-difference splitting method to spatially discretize the mean flow and Shear Stress Transport turbulence model equations. The tightly coupled system of equations is marched in time using an explicit multistage time stepping scheme. The speed and memory requirements of the scheme are optimized {{through the use of a}} <b>structured</b> <b>arrangement</b> for the boundary-fitted grid solution data and an unstructured arrangement for the cartesian grid solution data. Coupling of the solutions within each component grid is achieved by any of three interpolation methods: bilinear (first-order), quadratic (second-order), and a novel viscous adaptation of the second-order multidimensional characteristic boundary point treatment developed here. The viability of the composite grid approach is demonstrated on a variety of inviscid, laminar viscous, and turbulent viscous flowfields through comparisons with exact solutions or experimental data, as well as results using a similar single grid algorithm. Although globally second-order solutions are obtained using any of the interface treatments, minimum solution errors are generally realized using the characteristic scheme. Full overlap of the meshes is shown to be a requirement for adequate solution quality with bilinear interpolation, and for stable solutions using high-order interpolation in the presence of flowfield discontinuities. ...|$|E

The analysis of these mixtures, {{with the objective of}} estimating the individual sounds which constitute them, is known as musical instrument sound source separation, and has applications in audio coding, audio restoration, music production, music information retrieval and music education. This thesis principally addresses the issues related to the separation of harmonic musical instrument sound sources in single-channel mixtures. The contributions presented in this work include novel separation methods which exploit the characteristic structure and inherent correlations of pitched sound sources; as well as an exploration of the musical timbre space, for the development of an objective distortion metric to evaluate the perceptual quality of separated sources. The separation methods presented in this work address the concordant nature of musical mixtures using a model-based paradigm. Model parameters are estimated for each source, beginning with a novel, computationally efficient algorithm for the refinement of frequency estimates of the detected harmonics. Harmonic tracks are formed, and overlapping components are resolved by exploiting spectro-temporal intra-instrument dependencies, integrating the spectral and temporal approaches which are currently employed in a mutually exclusive manner in existing systems. Subsequent to the harmonic magnitude extraction using this method, a unique, closed-loop approach to source synthesis is presented, separating sources by iteratively minimizing the aggregate error of the sources, constraining the minimization to a set of estimated parameters. The proposed methods are evaluated independently, and then are placed {{within the context of a}} source separation system, which is evaluated using objective and subjective measures. The evaluation of music source separation systems is presently limited by the simplicity of objective measures, and the extensive effort required to conduct subjective evaluations. To contribute to the development of perceptually relevant evaluations, three psychoacoustic experiments are also presented, exploring the perceptual sensitivity of timbre for the development of an objective distortion metric for timbre. The experiments investigate spectral envelope sensitivity, spectral envelope morphing and noise sensitivity...|$|E
