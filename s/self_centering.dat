40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the construction of}} subjectivity, linking it to the temporality of historical and social issues that marked each era {{of the development of}} humanity. Since the man of Antiquity, of the Middle Ages, of the Enlightenment and the Modernism, people have witnessed the changes that marked the passage from one time to another. This process of evolution and revolution has always denoted linearity, a continuous line of progress and leaps, causing changes in the intimate and emotional life of man; up to that point, man was seen as owning the world and science was thought of as existing because of him. The subjectivity constructed {{in the early days of}} modernity had its basis on notions of interiority and reflection on itself. However, what is actually highlighted is a reading of subjectivity in which the <b>self</b> <b>centering</b> is paradoxically combined with the value of the externality. In the last decades, a new social picture has been formed, in which the fragmentation of subjectivity occupies key position. This fragmentation is not only a new way of subjectivation, but the raw material through which other forms of subjectivation are forged. In post-modernity, innovation and transformation are no longer considered driven for the good of man, but a process of mutation of man and of the world in which he lives...|$|E

40|$|Up to now methods using {{artifacts}} {{to inspect}} large coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) are suitable only for interim checks and verification [1, 2]. For a full-scale error analysis of larger CMMs (at least one axis> 2 m) no readily applicable methodology exists so far, thus VDI and ISO have recently started activities yielding traceability of large CMMs. Regarding this background methods for a full-scale error analysis of large CMMs (calibration, error correction & performance tests) were developed under the EC funded SM&T Programme (project SMT 4 -PL 97 - 2330). Methods {{are based on}} calibrated artifacts, which are described here: Light weight ball plates, disassemblable ball plates and disassemblable multi-ball bars. CMM manufacturers and users are testing methods and artifacts. Error models were extended to include non-rigid-body errors, typical of large CMMs (methods for error assessment and algorithms for numerical correction). New artifacts, their justification, their design criteria Three types of artifacts are studied to optimize their costs, calibration procedures, sta-bility, and the error assessment processes. In all cases carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) is used to reduce weight, reach optimum stiffness and to avoid thermal effects. The new artifacts (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) surfaces are sealed to avoid humidity influences. 1. A ball plate with carbon fiber rod structure (Fig. 1) giving compatibility with existing measurement and evaluation strategies, but being limited to 1. 5 m x 2 m size. Fig. 2 shows the required 6 measurement setups on a horizontal arm CMM. 2. A disassemblable ball plate with L-shape of carbon fiber tubes (Fig. 3 and 4). The main advantage is the 2 D-feature, resulting in a minimum of only six measure-ment setups for a full rigid-body error analysis, including some non-rigid-body errors. 3. A disassemblable multi-ball-beam of carbon fiber pipes (Fig. 4 and 3) made of the same structural elements as the L-shaped plate. It can be calibrated in situ, com-bining a length transfer (with <b>self</b> <b>centering</b> transfer apparatus and calibrated refe-rence ball beam) and a two-position reversal technique (on CMM to be calibrated) ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) has been {{developed}} to answer {{the growing number of}} societal needs, as well as advancing the bridge practice. ABC offers faster bridge construction through prefabrication of the bridge substructure and superstructure elements in a factory, and the subsequent on-site assembly of the elements. In countries such as the United States, many of the state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) have developed ABC according to their own societal needs. There have been many applications of ABC in the United States, primarily in Texas, Utah, New Jersey, Florida, and Washington. However, application of ABC in regions with moderate-to-high seismicity requires in depth development, detailing consideration, experimental investigation, and analytical guidelines for the suitable connections between the precast members. Over the last several years, two types of connections have been proposed for the prefabricated concrete bridge elements in seismic regions. The first type is called “emulative cast-in-place” which targets a similar seismic performance as that from a cast-in-place construction (e. g. formation of plastic hinges in the piers). This type of connection offers the advantage for prefabrication of the bridge elements which accelerates the bridge construction time. However, extensive damage to the bridge can be expected during a design level earthquake. Therefore, when referred in context of ABC, the emulative cast-in-place solution is called “ABC High Damage” in this research. The second type of the proposed connections for ABC in seismic regions is a nonemulative solution called “Dissipative Controlled Rocking” (DCR). DCR connections combine unbonded post-tensioning tendons with external energy dissipaters between the precast members. The unbonded post-tensioning provides <b>self</b> <b>centering</b> for the bridge with dissipaters absorbing the seismic energy. DCR connections are traditionally called "Hybrid" connections". They were primarily developed for multi-storey precast buildings in the late 1990 s. Past observations from seismic performance of the precast buildings incorporating DCR connections, have shown minimal damage and business disruption in the structure following a major earthquake. Therefore, when DCR connections are used in ABC context, it can be called “ABC Low Damage”. In this thesis, the use of emulative and DCR connections for ABC High Damage and ABC Low Damage has been thoroughly developed and experimentally tested. A series of quasi-static cyclic tests are performed on half-scale fully prefabricated cantilever and multi-column bridge piers. The specimens incorporate emulative and DCR connections between the precast elements. Several types of innovative dissipaters that can be used with DCR connections in ABC Low Damage, have been developed and experimentally validated. The design procedure, detailing consideration, construction technology, assembly sequence, experimental results, seismic performance, and analytical modeling, are presented for each type of ABC solutions discussed in the study. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the seismic performance of ABC High Damage and ABC Low Damage are also thoroughly presented. The research concludes that ABC Low Damage offers the best seismic performance compared to ABC High Damage and cast-in-place solutions. The life-cycle cost analysis and seismic loss assessment for the above solutions are outside the scope this study. However, past research works on similar topics have shown that if the life-cycle cost of a bridge is considered, then the traditional cast-in-place, ABC High Damage, and ABC Low Damage solutions may result in similar total cost...|$|E

The DRI of each vertex has some specific properties for some basic class of graphs. For example if graph is of degree 2 and the DRI sequence then the graph is a path. Using these observations we can determine the class of graph.

By an example it is shown that a unique eccentric node fuzzy graph with each node eccentric need not be <b>self</b> <b>centered.</b> Sufficient conditions for a fuzzy cycle to be <b>self</b> <b>centered</b> is given in section 4. A necessary and sufficient condition for a complete fuzzy graph to be <b>self</b> <b>centered</b> is given in section 5. In section 6 we have the embedding theorem i.e; construction of fuzzy graph G from a given fuzzy graph H such that <C(G)> ≅H. In section 7, based on this metric it is proved that an eccentric node of a fuzzy tree G is a fuzzy end node of G and a node is an eccentric node of a fuzzy tree if and only if it is a peripheral node of G and the center of a fuzzy tree consists of either one or two neighboring nodes. In section 8 boundary node of a fuzzy graph based on strong sum distance is defined. Boundary nodes of fuzzy tree and complete fuzzy graph are discussed in this section. A complete node is defined and it is showed by an example that a complete node need not be a boundary node. Also an example to show that fuzzy cut node can be a boundary node is given in this section. Interior of a fuzzy graph based on strong sum distance is defined in Section 9. In a fuzzy graph there are nodes which are neither boundary nodes nor interior nodes. Interior node in complete fuzzy graph and boundary nodes in a cycle are also discussed in this section.|$|R
