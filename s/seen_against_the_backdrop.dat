2500|$|Depending on a {{definition}} of collaboration (and of a Polish citizen, including the ethnicity and minority status considerations), scholars estimate number of [...] "Polish collaborators" [...] at around several thousand in {{a population of about}} 35 million (that number is supported by the Israeli War Crimes Commission). The estimate is based primarily on the number of death sentences for treason by the Special Courts of the Polish Underground State. The underground courts sentenced 10,000 Poles, including 200 death sentences. John Connelly quoted a Polish historian (Leszek Gondek) calling the phenomenon of Polish collaboration [...] "marginal" [...] and wrote that [...] "only relatively small percentage of Polish population engaged in activities that may be described as collaboration when <b>seen</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>backdrop</b> of European and world history".

2500|$|Another {{component}} of the patriotic sentiment is the religious note the play often strikes. On the whole, everything Catholic is represented as bad, everything Protestant is represented as good: [...] "The play's popularity [...] has to be <b>seen</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>backdrop</b> of an extraordinary efflorescence of interest in political history {{in the last two}} decades of the sixteenth century fed by self-conscious patriotic Protestantism's fascination with its own biography in history. It is not for nothing that Part One is persistently anti-Catholic in a number of ways despite the fact that in the fifteenth century the entire population of England was nominally Catholic (though not, of course, in 1592). The French are presented as decadently Catholic, the English (with the exception of the Bishop of Winchester) as attractively Protestant." [...] Talbot himself is an element of this, insofar as his [...] "rhetoric is correspondingly Protestant. His biblical references are all from the Old Testament (a source less fully used by Catholics) and speak of stoicism and individual faith." [...] Henry V is also cited as an example of Protestant purity: [...] "He was a king blest of the King of Kings./Unto the French the dreadful judgement day/So dreadful will not be as was his sight./The battles of the Lords of Hosts he fought" [...] (1.1.28–31). [...] "King of kings" [...] is a phrase used in 1 Timothy, 6:15. [...] "Lords of Hosts" [...] is used throughout the Old Testament, and to say Henry fought for the Lord of Hosts is to compare him to the warrior king, David, who also fought for the Lords of Hosts in 1 Samuel, 25:28.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to defend fictionalism as a {{response}} to the mathematical placement problem. As we will <b>see,</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>backdrop</b> of philosophical naturalism, it is difficult to see how to fit mathematical objects into our best total scientific theory. On the other hand, the indispensability argument seems to suggest that science itself mandates ontological commitment to mathematical entities. My goal is to undermine the indispensability argument by presenting an account of applied mathematics as a kind of revolutionary prop-oriented make-believe, the content of which is given by a mapping account of mathematical applications. This kind of fictionalism faces a number of challenges from various quarters. To begin with, we will have to face the challenge of a different kind of indispensability argument, one that draws ontological conclusions from the role of mathematical objects in scientific explanations. We will then examine one recent theory of mathematical scientific representation, and discover that the resulting position is Platonistic. At this point we will introduce our fictionalist account, and see that it defuses the Platonist consequences of mathematical representation. The closing chapters of the thesis then take a metaphilosophical turn. The legitmacy of a fictionalist response to the mathematical placement problem is open to challenge from a metaphilosophical perspective in two different ways: on the one hand, some modern pragmatists have argued that this kind of metaphysics relies on questionable assumptions about how langauge works. On the other, some modern philosophers have developed forms of metaontological anti-realism that they believe undermine the legitimacy of philosophical work in metaphysics. In the final two chapters I defend the fictionalist account developed here against these sceptical claims. I conclude that the fictionalist account of applied mathematics offered here is our best hope for coping with the mathematical placement problem. ...|$|R
2500|$|The Polish Underground State {{strongly}} opposed collaboration in anti-Jewish persecutions and threatened death to all informers against them, {{on behalf of}} the Polish military tribunals of the Home Army. Ot, widzi pan, sprawa jednej litery sprawia ogromną różnicę. Ratować i uratować! Ratowaliśmy kilkadziesiąt razy więcej ludzi, niż uratowaliśmy. – Władysław Bartoszewski}} However, the continued brutality of war led to the breakdown of traditional social norms and values. Some persons betrayed hidden Jews to the Germans, others made money as extortionists (szmalcownik), blackmailing Jews in hiding and Poles who protected them. Estimates of the number of Polish collaborators vary. The lower estimate of seven thousand is based primarily on the sentences of the Special Courts of the Polish Underground State, sentencing individuals for treason to the nation. The highest estimate yet of about one million collaborators, as proposed by a German historian, includes all Polish citizens who in some way contributed to the German activities, such as: low-ranking bureaucrats employed in Nazi German administration, construction workers, members of the Blue Police, slave laborers in German-run factories and farms and similar others (notably, the second figure originates from a single statistical table of outdated scholarship with a very thin source base). Relatively little active collaboration by individual Poles – with any aspect of the German presence – took place in Poland. All Nazi propaganda efforts to recruit Poles in either labor or auxiliary roles were met with almost no interest, due to the everyday reality of German occupation. The non-German Wachmänner guards in the extermination camps were mostly Ukrainian-speaking or native to the Baltic states. John Connelly, quoting Leszek Gondek, described the phenomenon of Polish collaboration as 'marginal' and stated that [...] "only relatively small percentage of Polish population engaged in activities that may be described as collaboration when <b>seen</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>backdrop</b> of European and world history".|$|E

40|$|The judicious {{and timely}} use of silence within worship is {{becoming}} increasingly recognised as a crucially important aspect of its performance. This article suggests that Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot has much to offer liturgists about silence’s dramatic potential {{and its ability to}} alert others to a contemplative mode of being. I refute the predominant way of seeing the play as an absurdist text and indicate that a more persuasive reading would situate it within a contemplative hermeneutics which gives due weight to silence as an ontological phenomenon. One key to appreciating this interpretation is to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> play <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>backdrop</b> of <b>the</b> Christian contemplative tradition.

5000|$|Mileham Castle (also {{referred}} to as [...] " [...] Hall Yards" [...] on old maps) {{is one of the}} largest motte and bailey castles in Norfolk. It straddles the B1145, a pre-Conquest road that remained the main east-west route through the county until the 17th century. The castle was constructed in about 1100 and its remains form a surprisingly imposing monument consisting of a motte built up around the fragments of a stone keep, two baileys and a further banked rectangular enclosure to the north of the road, which now contains Burwood Hall (built in 1793) and farm buildings. A large wooded deer park was once attached to the south of the castle. The positioning of the castle astride the road is thought to have been connected with raising revenue from a possible market place in the northern enclosure and from tolls on travellers. It is probable that the castle had fallen out of use by about 1300, but before then the tall keep, probably whitewashed, when <b>seen</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> green wooded <b>backdrop</b> of <b>the</b> deer park, would have been an impressive sight.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} problem of identity formation for transnational populations. It {{is concerned with the}} ways in which public cultural forms become central in the construction and reproduction of national and ethnic identities. By focusing on the dialectic between official discourse and the practices of daily life, I emphasize that identity is never permanently fixed yet can be imagined during times of public celebration. I use as my central object of study the Trinidad Carnival and its export from Trinidad and Tobago to Brooklyn, New York. The dissertation is based upon thirteen months of fieldwork in Trinidad and eight months in New York City and draws upon recorded interviews, archival sources and participant-observation. I worked in masquerade camps in Brooklyn and in Trinidad helping to construct Carnival costumes, followed Carnival goers as they traveled to other festivals, went to many Carnival shows and competitions and attended many fetes and block parties. I was chiefly interested in what transplanted Trinidadians thought about Carnival and in observing how they made Carnival part of their lives. I was curious to see how official rhetoric made an impact on their conception of themselves as Trinidadians. I found that official discourse has only a partial bearing on the ways people discuss their sense of self in cultural terms. Many other factors, including class and gender, play important roles. I conclude that ethnic and national identity formation must be <b>seen</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> larger <b>backdrop</b> of dominant global conceptions of culture. Such conceptions directly influence local policy making and help shape official rhetoric concerning expressive cultural forms such as Carnival. It is in relation to global ideas—both in their acceptance and in their rejection, both conscious and unconscious—that people begin to formulate ideas of cultural identity. * ^ *Originally published in DAI Vol. 58, No. 11.

5000|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} among historians that {{there was very little}} collaboration with the Nazis among the Polish nation as a whole, compared to other German-occupied countries.
