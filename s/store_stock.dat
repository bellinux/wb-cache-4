5|$|By {{the time}} of the elder Joseph Terry's death in 1850, Terry's was {{becoming}} a household name due to its previous trade successes across the country. The younger Joseph, along with his two brothers, Robert and John, are credited with moving confectionery production to an industrial scale with the leasing of a factory at Clementhorpe, beside the River Ouse, in 1862. Its location was particularly advantageous, as the 22-year-old Terry had drawn inspiration from the manipulation of the railways initiated by his father, and saw the benefit of importing and exporting from the river using steamboats. Vessels from the River Humber supplied coal for the factory, while larger ships would import ingredients such as sugar and cocoa from around the world twice a week. The Clementhorpe factory also improved the logistics of the company, providing ample room for the construction of warehouses to <b>store</b> <b>stock.</b> Two years later, there were 400 separate items in the firm's price list, with around 13 of them consisting of chocolate as a main ingredient; others included various candied peels, cakes, biscuits and jams among other more exotic products such as cream balls.|$|E
500|$|As a retailer, Marcus {{believed}} {{strongly in}} making his store {{into a place}} where everything a customer needed could be found and, if necessary, brought to the customer's front door. He {{was said to have}} helped one customer discover the shoe size of Queen Elizabeth II so as to give the gift of stockings and a pair of shoes, and he ordered that the <b>store</b> <b>stock</b> such items as a set of Steuben plates with the Mexican national crest, [...] "because sooner or later somebody will be going to call on the President of Mexico and need a proper gift." [...] He personally delivered a fur coat to a St. Louis, Missouri, customer who could not make the trip to Dallas. Another story often recounted is that of a shopper who, in searching for a present for his wife, said that he was not sure what to buy, but that he would know it when he saw it. In response, Marcus inquired about the woman's clothing sizes and asked the customer to wait briefly. Taking an oversized brandy snifter from a display, Marcus gathered cashmere sweaters of various colors, arranged them in imitation of a pousse-café, topped with a white angora sweater to simulate whipped cream, and in place of a cherry, garnished the concoction with a 10-karat ruby ring, at a total cost of $25,350, which the customer gladly paid. When one customer decided his Christmas purchases were not sufficiently impressive, Marcus helped to arrange a full duplication of the store's display window, complete with mannequins and lighting, inside the man's home.|$|E

5000|$|Packing and production: In many {{distribution}} centers it is {{not feasible}} to <b>store</b> <b>stock</b> in many different packaging styles or quantities, and while it may cost a customer more to do so, many customers, such as supermarkets, prefer their own packaging on stock.

In many circumstances this may be more inexpensively done at a distribution center than by a customer or client.|$|E

He still avoids Christine, but she wins him back by deliberately (and simply) disabling her TV, then calling his company for repairs while her parents are away. The company sends Antoine, who is once again bumbling and inept, trying for hours to fix a TV with just one missing tube. Morning finds the two of them in bed together.|$|E
