5|$|The Belgian {{strategy}} for a defence against German aggression faced political {{as well as}} military problems. In terms of military strategy, the Belgians were unwilling to stake everything on a linear defence of the Belgian–German border, in an extension of the Maginot Line. Such a move would leave the Belgians vulnerable to a German assault in their rear, through an attack on the Netherlands. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> would also rely on the French to move quickly into Belgium and support the garrison there.|$|E
5|$|After this NSS {{decided not}} to obtain many {{additional}} restaurants, as it did not see value in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy.</b> From 1930 through 1934 the company took over restaurants at Ål, Jaren, Lillestrøm and Tønsberg, along with dining service on the steamship Skibladner, which ran on Mjøsa. During {{the first half of}} the 1940s it again acquired new restaurants, including the one at Kristiansand Station. In 1940 and 1941 the company made a solid profit, but lack of food from 1942 onwards transformed the profit to a loss. During the late 1940s NSS also took over the restaurants at Drammen and Sarpsborg, as well as the one at Oslo Airport, Fornebu.|$|E
5|$|In fact, if <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> of {{financing}} development {{from outside the}} home country is undertaken, it creates a number of problems. For example, the foreign investors may carelessly misuse {{the resources of the}} underdeveloped country. This would in turn limit that economy's ability to diversify, especially if natural resources were plundered. This may also create a distorted social structure. Apart from this, there is also a risk that the foreign investments may be used to finance private luxury consumption. People would try to imitate Western consumption habits and thus a balance of payments crisis may develop, along with economic inequality within the population.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{species of}} coccinellids {{are thought to}} lay extra {{infertile}} eggs with the fertile eggs, apparently to provide a backup food source for the larvae when they hatch.

25|$|The S-Plan or Sabotage Campaign or England Campaign was a {{campaign}} of bombing and sabotage against the civil, economic, and military infrastructure of the United Kingdom from 1939 to 1940, conducted {{by members of the}} Irish Republican Army (IRA).

25|$|The colony {{cycle of}} D. norwegica is short because these species have a {{tendency}} to start in the spring. Their life-history strategy is known as Summer Advantage Strategy (SAS), which is distinctive of the Dolichovespula species. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> is implemented and used {{to take advantage of the}} short, yet favorable conditions of the summer season.

25|$|Among other behaviors, {{this means}} that {{men are more likely}} to favour {{chastity}} in a woman, as this way a male can be more certain that her offspring are his own. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> is seen in males, and maternity is never doubted by the female, and so a chaste male is not highly valued by a women. However, for men, female chastity confirms paternity, causing the male to compromising his sexual strategies in order to select a chaste mate.|$|E

25|$|In {{tropical}} climates they effectively out-compete European bees and, {{at their}} peak rate of expansion, they spread north {{at a rate of}} almost two kilometers (about one mile) a day. There were discussions about slowing the spread by placing large numbers of docile European-strain hives in strategic locations, particularly at the Isthmus of Panama, but various national and international agricultural departments were unable to prevent the bees' expansion. Current knowledge of the genetics of these bees suggests that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy,</b> had it been attempted, would not have been successful.|$|E
25|$|Douglass thought <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> was too risky, {{that there}} was barely enough support for black men's {{suffrage}}. He feared that linking the cause of women's suffrage to that of black men would result in failure for both. Douglass argued that white women, already empowered by their social connections to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. African-American women, he believed, {{would have the same}} degree of empowerment as white women once African-American men had the vote. Douglass assured the American women that at no time had he ever argued against women's right to vote.|$|E
25|$|One {{immediate}} {{consequence of}} the announcement was that Astor was beset by innumerable requests for money, and Astor decided to change his planned gift from a donation during his lifetime to a bequest in his will. By March 1839, Cogswell was asking Astor for money to purchase books at an auction, and Astor inquired whether {{it might not be}} possible to put the planning for the library into the hands of others, thus freeing himself from all care and trouble about it.

25|$|Rape is theorized to be a {{reproductive}} {{strategy that}} facilitates {{the propagation of}} the rapist's progency. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> may be adopted by men who otherwise {{are unlikely to be}} appealing to women and therefore cannot form legitimate relationships, or by high status men on socially vulnerable women who are unlikely to retaliate to increase their reproductive success even further. The sociobiological theories of rape are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation, and objections to this theory are made on ethical, religious, political, as well as scientific grounds.|$|E
25|$|Event-driven {{strategies}} concern {{situations in}} which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event. An event-driven investment strategy finds investment opportunities in corporate transactional events such as consolidations, acquisitions, recapitalizations, bankruptcies, and liquidations. Managers employing <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events, and take a position based on the predicted movement of the security or securities in question. Large institutional investors such as hedge funds {{are more likely to}} pursue event-driven investing strategies than traditional equity investors because they have the expertise and resources to analyze corporate transactional events for investment opportunities.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary theory {{predicts that}} males would be apt to seek more mating {{partners}} than females because they obtain higher reproductive benefits from <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy.</b> Accordingly, males developed many behavior strategies {{that allow them}} to acquire more reproductively capable sexual partners. Therefore, in order to monopolize periods of more than one female’s reproductive life span without being considered polygamous and thus breaking social norms of a monogamous society, males try to remarry women younger than themselves. A study done in 1994 found a significant difference between ages of remarried men and women because the men have a longer reproductive window.|$|E

25|$|The 2009 mayoral {{election}} in Burlington, Vermont {{provides an example}} in which strategy theoretically could have worked but would have been unlikely in practice. In that election, most supporters of the candidate who came in second (a Republican who led in first choices) preferred the Condorcet winner, a Democrat, to the IRV winner, the Progressive Party nominee. If 371 (12.6%) out of the 2951 backers of the Republican candidate (those who also preferred the Democrat over the Progressive candidate for mayor) had insincerely raised the Democrat from their second choice to their first (not changing their rankings relative to their least favorite candidate, the IRV winner), the Democrat would then advance to the final round (instead of their favorite), defeated any opponent, and have won the IRV election. This {{is an example of}} potential voter regret in that these voters who sincerely ranked their favorite candidate as first, find out after the fact that they caused the election of their least favorite candidate, which can lead to the voting tactic of compromising. Yet because the Republican led in first choices and only narrowly lost the final instant runoff, his backers would have been highly unlikely to pursue <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Quadrophenia tour {{started in}} Stoke on Trent in October and was {{immediately}} beset with problems. Daltrey resisted Townshend's wish to add Joe Cocker's keyboardist Chris Stainton (who played on the album) to the touring band. As a compromise, Townshend assembled the keyboard and synthesizer parts on backing tapes, as <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> had been successful with [...] "Baba O'Riley" [...] and [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again". Unfortunately, the technology was not sophisticated {{enough to deal with}} the demands of the music; added to this issue, tour rehearsals had been interrupted due to an argument that culminated in Daltrey punching Townshend and knocking him out cold. At a gig in Newcastle, the tapes completely malfunctioned, and an enraged Townshend dragged sound-man Bob Pridden on-stage, screamed at him, kicked all the amps over and partially destroyed the backing tapes. The show was abandoned for an [...] "oldies" [...] set, {{at the end of which}} Townshend smashed his guitar and Moon kicked over his drumkit. The Independent described this gig as one of the worst of all time. The US tour started on 20 November at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California; Moon passed out during [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again" [...] and during [...] "Magic Bus". Townshend asked the audience, [...] "Can anyone play the drums?—I mean somebody good." [...] An audience member, Scot Halpin, filled in for the rest of the show. After a show in Montreal, the band (except for Daltrey, who retired to bed early) caused so much damage to their hotel room, including destroying an antique painting and ramming a marble table through a wall, that federal law enforcement arrested them.|$|E
