40|$|Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative {{agent of}} Chagas' disease, {{which is a}} major endemic disease in Latin America and is {{recognized}} by the WHO {{as one of the}} 17 neglected tropical diseases in the world. Psilostachyin and psilostachyin C, two sesquiterpene lactones isolated <b>from</b> <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>spp.,</b> have been demonstrated to have trypanocidal activity. Considering both the potential therapeutic targets present in the parasite, and the several mechanisms of action proposed for sesquiterpene lactones, the aim of this work was to characterize the mode of action of psilostachyin and psilostachyin C on Trypanosoma cruzi and to identify the possible targets for these molecules. Psilostachyin and psilostachyin C were isolated <b>from</b> <b>Ambrosia</b> tenuifolia and Ambrosia scabra, respectively. Interaction of sesquiterpene lactones with hemin, the induction of oxidative stress, the inhibition of cruzipain and trypanothione reductase and their ability to inhibit sterol biosynthesis were evaluated. The induction of cell death by apoptosis was also evaluated by analyzing phosphatidylserine exposure detected using annexin-V/propidium iodide, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, assessed with Rhodamine 123 and nuclear DNA fragmentation evaluated by the TUNEL assay. Both STLs were capable of interacting with hemin. Psilostachyin increased about 5 times the generation of reactive oxygen species in Trypanosoma cruzi after a 4 h treatment, unlike psilostachyin C which induced an increase in reactive oxygen species levels of only 1. 5 times. Only psilostachyin C was able to inhibit the biosynthesis of ergosterol, causing an accumulation of squalene. Both sesquiterpene lactones induced parasite death by apoptosis. Upon evaluating the combination of both compounds, and additive trypanocidal effect was observed. Despite their structural similarity, both sesquiterpene lactones exerted their anti-T. cruzi activity through interaction with different targets. Psilostachyin accomplished its antiparasitic effect by interacting with hemin, while psilostachyin C interfered with sterol synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Heath was asked to issue a {{scientific}} opinion on the pest risk assessment made by Lithuania on <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>spp.,</b> requested by Lithuania to be inserted as a harmful organism in point c of section II, part A of Annex I to the Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. The Lithuanian risk assessment relates to three species of the genus Ambrosia: A. artemisiifolia L. (common ragweed), A. trifida L. (giant ragweed) and A. psilostachya DC (perennial ragweed). These plants are native to North America and are considered invasive both in their native area and {{in other parts of}} the world, including several countries in Europe. <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>spp.</b> are of particular public concern due to the allergenic properties of their pollen. The Panel examined in detail the three documents provided by Lithuania. The review evaluated the accuracy and relevance of data, the information provided for pest risk assessment purposes, the quality and quantity of data considered, and the quality of methods applied to conduct the risk assessment. The review was based on the principles and terminology of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 : Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO IPPC, 2006). With regard to the criteria of a quarantine pest, the Panel on Plant Health concludes that the Lithuanian documents do not provide sufficient evidence to assess on a scientifically sound basis whether <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>spp.</b> qualify as quarantine pests for Lithuania. The most important shortcomings are:* The pest of phytosanitary concern for Lithuania has been identified at a genus level. The genus Ambrosia includes too many species to be considered together, even if only three species A. artemisiifolia, A. trifida and A. psilostachya are deemed to pose a threat. Biological and ecological data clearly indicate that each of the three species would require its own or a better structured pest risk assessment clearly discriminating among the species of concern. * The documents clearly state that A. artemisiifolia and A. trifida are present in Lithuania. A. psilostachya is not reported. A table showing the number of plants of A. artemisiifolia in several sites and years is provided. Two maps showing sites infested with A. artemisiifolia and A. trifida in Lithuania are provided but without any date. Detailed information on the abundance of A. artemisiifolia and A. trifida over the years is necessary. Moreover, more specific details are needed on their habitats and their status (established or not). * Data on the different introduction pathways need to be revised. The current distribution for each of the three species outside Lithuania, especially in countries that are important trading partners of Lithuania, should be added to identify in more detail the risk for further introduction. More accurate data are required on the assessed pathways of the three species; alternative pathways (via bird seed, spreading by soil, machinery and tyres) should also be considered. * The impacts on crop yields and on human health are discussed in two documents provided by Lithuania, but it is not possible to conclude from these documents that <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>spp.</b> would be of potential economic importance for Lithuania, i. e. through direct or indirect effects on cultivated plants in agriculture, uncultivated/unmanaged plants, wild flora, habitats or ecosystem. Impacts on human health are also not given sufficient attention. * The endangered area is not defined. However, there is scientific evidence both in the provided document and the existing literature that <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>spp.</b> can cause detrimental impacts on human health due to their allergenic properties. The control of <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>spp.</b> is difficult in certain crops and in non cultivated areas. The Panel on Plant Health therefore recommends that the pest risk assessment should be revised and updated. As stated above, it should be undertaken for each of the species of concern. In order to assess the risks related to each <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>spp.,</b> additional information and amendments would be needed regarding the following aspects:* current distribution and abundance in Lithuania of the species already present A. artemisiifolia and A. trifida (providing references and/or official surveys data), including listing of habitats and the status (established or not);* current distribution of <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>spp.</b> outside Lithuania, to identify in more detail the risk of further introduction into the country;* more accurate data on the pathways already assessed; consideration of alternative pathways (bird seed, spreading by soil, machinery and tyres);* more accurate assessment of the potential for establishment in Lithuania (including photoperiod and climatic conditions, and other abiotic factors);* update on the efficacy of control measures;* effects on crop yield for the main crops. This is important as the levels of infestation with <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>spp.</b> and the efficiency of the methods of control are not the same for all crops;* more accurate assessment of potential economic importance (including impacts on human health and other social impacts);* identification of the endangered area;* discussion of uncertainties on all aspects of the pest risk assessment...|$|R

40|$|Allergenic ragweed (<b>Ambrosia</b> <b>spp.)</b> pollen grains, {{after being}} {{released}} from anthers, can be dispersed by air masses far from their source. However, the action of air temperature,humidity and solar radiation on pollen grains in the atmosphere could impact {{on the ability of}} long distance transported (LDT) pollen to maintain allergenic potency. Here, we report that the major allergen of Ambrosia artemisiifolia pollen (Amb a 1) collected in ambient air during episodes of LDT still have immunoreactive properties. The amount of Amb a 1 found in LDT ragweed pollen grains was not constant and varied between episodes. In addition to allergens in pollen sized particles, we detected reactive Amb a 1 in subpollen sized respirable particles. These findings suggest that ragweed pollen grains have the potential to cause allergic reactions, not only in the heavily infested areas but, due to LDT episodes, also in the regions unaffected by ragweed populations...|$|R

50|$|Eastern towhees eat {{a variety}} {{of plant and animal}} matter. In {{literature}} reviews, eastern towhees are reported to eat seeds and fruits, several invertebrates, and occasionally small amphibians, snakes, and lizards. Reviews report eastern towhees foraging at feeders. Reviews show that animal matter makes up a larger proportion of the diet in the breeding season. In fall and winter, plants make up 79% and 85% of the diet, respectively. This drops to 53% in spring and 43% in summer. Insects such as beetles (Coleoptera), grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera), ants, wasps, and bees (Hymenoptera), and moths and caterpillars (Lepidoptera) are common prey items. Eastern towhees eat other invertebrates such as spiders (Araneae), millipedes (Diplopoda), centipedes (Chilopoda), and snails (Gastropoda) to a lesser extent. Plants that comprise at least 5% of the eastern towhee diet include ragweed (<b>Ambrosia</b> <b>spp.),</b> oak, smartweed (Polygonum spp.), and corn (Zea mays) in the Northeast and blackberry, oak, panicgrass (Panicum spp.), ragweed, and wax-myrtle (Morella cerifera) in the Southeast.|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{aspect of}} climate change is the potential shifts in flowering phenology and pollen initiation associated with milder winters and warmer seasonal air temperature. Earlier floral anthesis has been suggested, in turn, to {{have a role in}} human disease by increasing time of exposure to pollen that causes allergic rhinitis and related asthma. However, earlier floral initiation does not necessarily alter the temporal duration of the pollen season, and, to date, no consistent continental trend in pollen season length has been demonstrated. Here we report that duration of the ragweed (<b>Ambrosia</b> <b>spp.)</b> pollen season has been increasing in recent decades as a function of latitude in North America. Latitudinal effects on increasing season length were associated primarily with a delay in first frost of the fall season and lengthening of the frost free period. Overall, these data indicate {{a significant increase in the}} length of the ragweed pollen season by as much as 13 – 27 d at latitudes above ~ 44 °N since 1995. This is consistent with recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections regarding enhanced warming as a function of latitude. If similar warming trends accompany long-term climate change, greater exposure times to seasonal allergens may occur with subsequent effects on public health...|$|R

40|$|The {{spread and}} {{durability}} of harmful neophytes such as Ambrosia (ragweed) will increase {{due to global}} warming and ever rising globalization. Therefore, in the past years two <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>spp.</b> have established in Berlin. The “Berlin Action programme against Ambrosia” was started in order to monitor the occurrence of the two species in Berlin and to reduce their populations as far as possible. From 2009 to 2012 on average 1. 000 populations per year were discovered. In Berlin two species occur, the annual A. artemisiifolia and the perennial A. psilostachya which release their highly allergenic pollen in late summer. The annual herb, which is mostly introduced with bird seed, is often distributed in small populations with up to 10 plants throughout the city and can be successfully controlled by frequenty repeated measures.
