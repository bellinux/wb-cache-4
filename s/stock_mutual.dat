2500|$|Thomas H. Forester (born December 15, 1958) is an American {{mutual fund}} manager. [...] He {{was the only}} long-focused United States <b>stock</b> <b>mutual</b> fund manager {{to make a profit}} in 2008. [...] He had {{previously}} been the highest return mutual fund manager of the 6000 tracked by Morningstar and one of only two managers to turn a profit for the third quarter of 2002. [...] He had also previously been number one in his asset class year to date through November 1, 2004, although controversially.|$|E
2500|$|Investment managers, such as <b>stock</b> <b>mutual</b> fund managers, are {{compensated}} and {{retained in}} part due to their performance relative to peers. Taking a conservative or contrarian position as a bubble builds results in performance unfavorable to peers. [...] This may cause customers to go elsewhere and can affect the investment manager's own employment or compensation. The typical short-term focus of U.S. equity markets exacerbates the risk for investment managers that do not participate during the building phase of a bubble, particularly one that builds {{over a longer period of}} time. In attempting to maximize returns for clients and maintain their employment, they may rationally participate in a bubble they believe to be forming, as the risks of not doing so outweigh the benefits.|$|E

[...] 1,700 of these {{funds have been}} in existence for over three years and have assets of at least $50 million. [...] Forester's Forester Value Fund (FVALX), which is Morningstar five-star-rated, gained [...]4% in 2008 although one year it lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 (S 500) by 30%. The fund, which had been up 7% through June 30 by avoiding the housing crisis and the credit crisis, was down 4.3% on the year through December 15 and 0.82% on the year entering {{the last day of}} trading. [...] In 2008, the second best of the 1,700 funds was Mario Gabelli's Gabelli ABC Fund, which lost only 2.6%. [...] Morningstar tracks a total of 9,918 mutual funds that averaged a 39.1% loss in 2008. [...] Much of Forester's success was attributable to large cash positions. [...] However, he also benefited from several timely trades in the banking sector, health care. [...] His fund held positions in countercyclical stocks that perform well in recessions. [...] He had also held large cash positions during the dot-com bubble. [...] In the third quarter of 2002, his fund was one of two out of 6000 that turned a profit. [...] One of the most important financial ratios for Forest was the ratio of home prices to incomes, which helped him foresee trouble in the housing market.|$|E

50|$|Hybrid {{clubs are}} a {{combination}} {{of two or more}} of the above types of investment clubs. Typically, real estate investment clubs are lower in risk and provide higher returns of 21% to 70% than <b>stock,</b> <b>mutual</b> fund or bond investment clubs due to the ongoing need for housing and population growth. Business investment clubs have about equal risk when compared to <b>stock,</b> <b>mutual</b> fund or bond investment clubs. However, business investment clubs have several additional benefits which include significantly higher returns and lower operating expenses measured by the net profit per year divided by the amount of cash necessary to purchase the business. Additionally, you can also hire yourself or family members to work in the business as employees.|$|E

We began the study with two questions in mind: "Do <b>stocks</b> and <b>mutuals</b> use different production technologies?" and "Are <b>stocks</b> and <b>mutuals</b> equally efficient or is one form relatively more efficient than the other?". Using some cost and error structure tests that resemble those found in recent efficiency studies, we find evidence that <b>stocks</b> and <b>mutuals</b> have distinctive cost structures and production technologies. Results also show that efficiency varies with organizational form, with stocks being more scale efficient than mutuals but mutuals being more X-efficient than stocks. ...|$|R

50|$|Suppose {{you were}} going to make an {{investment}} into only one of three investment vehicles: <b>stock,</b> <b>mutual</b> fund, or certificate of deposit (CD). Further suppose, that the market has a 50% chance of increasing, a 30% chance of staying even, and a 20% chance of decreasing. If the market increases the stock investment will earn $1500 and the mutual fund will earn $900. If the market stays even the stock investment will earn $300 and the mutual fund will earn $600. If the market decreases the stock investment will lose $800 and the mutual fund will lose $200. The certificate of deposit will earn $500 independent of the market's fluctuation.|$|E
50|$|Mutual fund flows are {{published}} by organizations like Investment Company Institute and TrimTabs.

For example, {{in the beginning of}} the 2000s, the largest inflows to <b>stock</b> <b>mutual</b> funds were in early 2000 while the largest outflows were in mid-2002. It is good to note that these mutual fund flows were near the start of a significant bear (downtrending) market and bull (uptrending) market respectively. A similar pattern is repeated near the end of the decade. Chien of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis confirms the correlation showing return-chasing behavior.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the relative efficiency of 210 mutual {{savings and loan}} associations (S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s) and 165 stock S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s located in five states during the 1974 - 83 time period. Since all <b>mutual</b> and most <b>stock</b> S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s lack publicly traded stock, data for market return and market risk estimates are unavailable. Hence, this study employs accounting based measures of risk and return. Annual residual returns are calculated for both <b>stock</b> and <b>mutual</b> S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s. The residual return {{is the difference between}} expected accounting returns adjusted for systematic or total risk and actual accounting returns. Mean difference t-tests are employed to test the research hypothesis of equal efficiency as measured by the average residuals between <b>stock</b> and <b>mutual</b> S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s. The results indicate no significant difference in average residuals between <b>stock</b> and <b>mutual</b> S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s. The null hypothesis of equal efficiency cannot be rejected. Hence, based upon accounting measures of risk and return both <b>stock</b> and <b>mutual</b> institutions earn returns consistent with their levels of risk. ...|$|R
40|$|In most European {{countries}} {{life insurance}} {{has played a}} key role in household portfolios, to the extent that it has often been the first asset ever purchased. In this paper we use life history data from a host of European countries to investigate the role of life insurance investment in shaping individuals’ attitudes towards participation in <b>stocks</b> and <b>mutual</b> funds. We show that individuals who purchased a life insurance policy are more likely to invest in <b>stocks</b> and <b>mutual</b> funds later. On the one hand, these findings support the notion that life insurance policies play an educational role in financial investment. On the other hand, they are also consistent with behavioural models where economic agents are first concerned with avoiding unacceptable adverse scenarios by purchasing low risk investments, such as life insurance policies, and then invest in riskier assets, such as <b>stocks</b> and <b>mutual</b> funds, to obtain higher economic returns...|$|R
