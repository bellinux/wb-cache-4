Results A 42 -year-old woman presented with a 5 -month history of abdominal pain, vomit, and weight loss. An abdominal CT scan showed an obstruction of the third part of the duodenum. Segmental intestinal resection was carried out and histopathology examination revealed heavy <b>Strongyloides</b> <b>stercoralis</b> <b>infestation.</b> Duodenal obstruction is a rare complication of S. stercoralis infection, with only 8 cases described in the literature since 1970.

40|$|Background. <b>Strongyloides</b> <b>stercoralis</b> is an {{intestinal}} nematode parasite {{classified as}} a soil-transmitted helminth, endemic in tropical and subtropical regions. <b>Strongyloides</b> <b>stercoralis</b> can remain dormant for decades after the initial infection. Case. We describe a patient who was diagnosed with <b>Strongyloides</b> <b>stercoralis</b> infection three weeks after a left inguinal hernia repair and discuss approaches to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Conclusions. Physicians in the United States often miss opportunities to identify patients with chronic strongyloidiasis. Symptoms may be vague and screening tests have limitations.

40|$|Objective: to {{investigate}} the first reported cases of strongyloidiasis in the Solomon Islands, and to establish whether this disease poses a risk to personnel of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). Design, setting and participants: Retrospective review of the pathology database of the RAMSI Medical Facility in Honiara, Solomon Islands, for the period 1 July 2006 – 30 September 2007. Main outcome measures: number and clinical features of confirmed cases of <b>Strongyloides</b> <b>stercoralis</b> <b>infestation,</b> as diagnosed by serological tests or faecal microscopy. Results: fourteen confirmed cases of strongyloidiasis in previously healthy RAMSI participants were identified. Of 13 patients with notes available, symptoms documented at presentation included epigastric pain (10 patients), diarrhoea (7) and urticaria (4). Clinical disease in all patients responded to oral antihelminthic therapy (albendazole or ivermectin). Conclusions: Strongyloidiasis is endemic in the Solomon Islands and a risk for RAMSI personnel. Australian medical professionals {{should be aware of}} this potentially fatal and lifelong infestation, particularly the importance of an occupation history, appropriate diagnostic tests, effective treatment and adequate follow-up to document cure.
