25|$|Nigamananda {{said that}} one <b>should</b> <b>{{remember}}</b> <b>that</b> death is coming. Before working on good or evil deeds one should also remember that death is not far off. Contemplating death drives away the desire for sensual pleasure and evil thoughts and stops acts of injustice. Attachment to wealth and relations will then diminish. Earthly matters remain even after departure from this world. Only spiritual wealth remains as an asset to the individual. Those who have puffed with pride on account of their accomplishments will submit to the God of death meekly when that hour comes. Drunk with pride, some persons ill-treat their brethren. They will {{be left in the}} deserted crematory ground with the beasts and birds joyously waiting to feast upon their flesh. Thinking of this will drive evil thoughts from the mind.|$|E

[...] "Without slighting Kranz's role", Murray commented, [...] "the world <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> it was Glynn Lunney ... who orchestrated a masterpiece of improvisation that moved the astronauts safely to the lunar module while sidestepping a dozen potential catastrophes that could have doomed them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Suffering from {{rheumatoid}} arthritis, it was {{too painful}} for Bowden to signal a batsman out in the conventional fashion, with a straight index finger raised above the head, and {{this led to the}} [...] "crooked finger of doom". He has also put his own slant on several other signals, including a [...] "crumb-sweeping" [...] wave of the arm to signal four, and the [...] "double crooked finger six-phase hop" [...] to signal a six. His signals are sedate in Tests, more flashy in ODIs and decidedly flamboyant in Twenty20. His behavior has attracted him both fans and critics almost equally. Martin Crowe referred to him as Bozo the Clown, and at least one commentator has said he <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> cricket is for the players and fans, not for the umpires. However, there was a suggestion that he needs to do the signals in the way he does because of his arthritis, as he needs to keep his body fluid.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 May 2006, then Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres {{said in an}} {{interview}} with Reuters that [...] "the president of Iran <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> Iran can also be wiped off the map," [...] Army Radio reported. Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, drew unusually stiff criticism from an analyst on Israel's state television, Yoav Limor, for talking of destroying another country. In May 2006, IDF Chief of Staff Dan Halutz stated that Iran’s nuclear facilities can be destroyed, hinting at a possible plan to do just that. In September 2007, Israel repeated its policy concerning the development of nuclear capacity by its potential enemies. [...] Shabtai Shavit, a former chief of the Mossad, said Iranian atomic facilities could be destroyed within a year, but has not ruled out going that direction. Isaac Ben-Israel, a former general of the Israeli Air Force, said an attack could be carried out at any time but only as a last resort. Iran's Shahab-3 missile exercises were conducted in early July demonstrating that Israel was within reach.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the issue}} of the nuclear program of Iran and the {{supposed}} existential threat this poses for Israel, Peres stated, [...] "I am not in favor of a military attack on Iran, but we must quickly and decisively establish a strong, aggressive coalition of nations that will impose painful economic sanctions on Iran", adding [...] "Iran's efforts to achieve nuclear weapons should keep the entire world from sleeping soundly." [...] In the same speech, Peres compared Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his call to [...] "wipe Israel off the map" [...] to the genocidal threats to European Jewry made by Adolf Hitler in the years prior to the Holocaust. In an interview with Army Radio on May 8, 2006 he remarked that [...] "the president of Iran <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> Iran can also be wiped off the map." [...] However, after his death it was revealed that Peres had said that he prevented a military strike on Iran's nuclear program that had been ordered by Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|What I am {{concerned}} about is the trend, common among present-day Buddhist teachers, of recasting the core principles of the Buddha's teachings into largely psychological terms and then saying, [...] "This is Dhamma." [...] When this is done we may never get {{to see that the}} real purpose of the teaching, in its own framework, is not to induce [...] "healing" [...] or [...] "wholeness" [...] or [...] "self-acceptance," [...] but to propel the mind in the direction of deliverance – and to do so by attenuating, and finally extricating, all those mental factors responsible for our bondage and suffering. We <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the Buddha did not teach the Dhamma as an [...] "art of living" [...] – though it includes that – but above all as a path to deliverance, a path to final liberation and enlightenment. And what the Buddha means by enlightenment is not a celebration of the limitations of the human condition, not a passive submission to our frailties, but an overcoming of those limitations by making a radical, revolutionary breakthrough to an altogether different dimension of being.|$|E

2500|$|Callum then {{explains}} {{that he wants to}} find his real mother and tell her that he hates her, which devastates Sonya. She tells her sister that she cannot tell him the truth now as she cannot handle him looking at her, knowing what she did. Callum steps up his investigation into the identity of his mother and is injured in an accident while looking for clues. At the hospital, he recalls a memory about his mother and realises that she is Sonya. Toadie then [...] "angrily orders" [...] Sonya to leave. Of the revelation, Morey said [...] "For Toadie, it's a betrayal to both him and his son. He's angry, but his initial priority is to make Callum number one." [...] Morey quipped that filming the scenes was [...] "exhausting." [...] The actress also explained that Toadie's reaction to finding out that Sonya is Callum's real mother was one of devastation, he has to question whether Sonya ever loved him or was only with him to get Callum. Morey told a writer for What's on TV that it had been [...] "fun" [...] to see Sonya change when she could finally be a mother to Callum. She added that Sonya would probably struggle with everything that happened with Callum, but she <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> she has been forgiven.|$|E
