5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the <b>spreading</b> <b>mechanism</b> and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid <b>spreading</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread.

50|$|The basic {{operating}} {{concept of}} broadcast spreads is simple. A large material hopper is positioned over a horizontal spinning disk, the disk has {{a series of}} 3 or 4 fins attached to it which throw the dropped materials from the hopper out {{and away from the}} seeder/spreader. Alternately a pendulum <b>spreading</b> <b>mechanism</b> may be employed, this method is more common in mid-sized commercial spreaders for improved consistency in spreading. The photos clearly show the material hopper. Hoppers are commonly made of plastic, painted steel, or stainless steel. Stainless steel is usually used in large commercial units for strength and because granular fertilizer is often quite corrosive.|$|E
50|$|The within-host {{dynamics}} of HIV infection include {{the spread of}} the virus in vivo, the establishment of latency, the effects of immune response on the virus, etc. Early studies used simple models and only considered the cell-free spreading of HIV, in which virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid, and then infect another T cell. A 2015 study proposes a more realistic model of HIV dynamics that also incorporates the viral cell-to-cell <b>spreading</b> <b>mechanism,</b> where the virus is directly transited from one cell to another, as well as the T cell activation, the cellular immune response, and the immune exhaustion as the infection progresses.|$|E

The Germ theory of disease and the systematic observation of possible disease causing microorganisms were just starting in this era. The cause of cholera, ingesting [...] "invisible" [...] cholera germs from cholera infected fecal contaminated water or food was not known. Although magnifying lenses had been discovered in 1592 effective microscopes that could see germs well were just being developed and widely used starting in the 1860s. The prevention or effective treatment for cholera, once patients were infected, were unknown in this era and death rates then sometimes reached 50% of infected people. Cholera infections spread rampantly in the era before possible sources of cholera were identified, cholera carriers isolated and before effective water and sewage treatment facilities were developed and deployed.|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of highly {{pathogenic}} avian influenza (HPAI) H 5 N 1 outbreaks in poultry and wild birds {{have been reported in}} Europe since 2005. Distinct spatial patterns in poultry and wild birds suggest that different environmental drivers and potentially different <b>spread</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are operating. However, previous studies found no difference between these two outbreak types when only the effect of physical environmental factors was analysed. The influence of physical and anthropogenic environmental variables and interactions between the two has only been investigated for wild bird outbreaks. We therefore tested the effect of these environmental factors on HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks in poultry, and the potential <b>spread</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and discussed how these differ from those observed in wild birds. Logistic regression analyses were used to quantify the relationship between HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks in poultry and environmental factors. Poultry outbreaks increased with an increasing human population density combined with close proximity to lakes or wetlands, increased temperatures and reduced precipitation during the cold season. A risk map was generated based on the identified key factors. In wild birds, outbreaks were strongly associated with an increased Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and lower elevation, though they were similarly affected by climatic conditions as poultry outbreaks. This is the first study that analyses the differences in environmental drivers and <b>spread</b> <b>mechanisms</b> between poultry and wild bird outbreaks.

HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. Two pathways of cell-to-cell transmission have been reported. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus directly to a target T cell via a virological synapse. Secondly, an antigen presenting cell (APC) can also transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer {{is reported to be}} much more efficient than cell-free virus spread. A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell to the contact zone. Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4+ T lymphocytes are densely packed and likely to frequently interact. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse in vivo. The hybrid <b>spreading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|R
