40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to improve the stability of carbamazepine (CBZ) bulk powder under high humidity by surface modification. The <b>surface-modified</b> anhydrates of CBZ were obtained in a specially designed surface modification apparatus at 60 °C via the adsorption of n-butanol, and powder x-ray diffraction, Fourier-Transformed Infrared spectra, and differential scanning calorimetry were used to determine the crystalline characteristics of the samples. The hydration process of intact and <b>surface-modified</b> CBZ anhydrate at 97 % relative humidity (RH) and 40 ± 1 °C was automatically monitored by using isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC). The dissolution test for <b>surface-modified</b> samples (20 mg) was performed in 900 mL of distilled water at 37 ± 0. 5 °C with stirring by a paddle at 100 rpm as in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia XIII. The heat flow profiles of hydration of intact and <b>surface-modified</b> CBZ anhydrates at 97 % RH by using IMC profiles showed a maximum peak at around 10 hours and 45 hours after 0 and 10 hours of induction, respectively. The result indicated that hydration of CBZ anhydrate was completely inhibited at the initial stage by surface modification of n-butanol and thereafter transformed into dihydrate. The hydration of <b>surface-modified</b> samples followed a 2 -dimensional phase boundary process with an induction period (IP). The IP of intact and <b>surface-modified</b> samples decreased with increase of the reaction temperature, and the hydration rate constant (k) increased with increase of the temperature. The crystal growth rate constants of nuclei of the intact sample were significantly larger than the <b>surface-modified</b> samples at each temperature. The activation energy (E) of nuclei formation and crystal growth process for hydration of <b>surface-modified</b> CBZ anhydrate were evaluated to be 20. 1 and 32. 5 kJ/mol, respectively, from Arrhenius plots, but the Es of intact anhydrate were 56. 3 and 26. 8 kJ/mol, respectively. The dissolution profiles showed that the <b>surface-modified</b> sample dissolved faster than the intact sample at the initial stage. The dissolution kinetics were analyzed based on the Hixon-Crowell equation, and the dissolution rate constants for intact and <b>surface-modified</b> anhydrates were found to be 0. 0102 ± 0. 008 mg 1 / 3 min− 1 and 0. 1442 ± 0. 0482 mg 1 / 3 ·min− 1.

30|$|From {{the results}} of this study, it can be {{concluded}} that the addition of <b>surface-modified</b> silica nanoparticles has substantially boosted the conventional foam stability.

40|$|Background. The {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass (CPB) circuit induces blood activation and {{a systemic}} inflammatory response in cardiac surgical patients. The CPB circuit treated with <b>surface-modifying</b> additive (SMA) {{has been found}} to reduce blood activation by in vitro and ex vivo experiments. This study evaluates the surface thrombogenicity and complement activation of SMA circuits during clinical CPB. Methods. Twenty patients undergoing corollary artery bypass grafting were randomly divided into two groups. In the SMA group (n = 10), all blood-contacting surfaces in the CPB circuit were treated or coated with SMA, whereas in the control group (n = 10) patients were perfused with an identical circuit without treatment. Results. During CPB, platelet count and beta-thromboglobulin were found similar in both the SMA and the control groups. Prothrombin activation indicated by fragment F 1 + 2 was found less in the SMA group (p < 0. 05). After CPB, platelet deposition on the CPB circuit was significantly less (p < 0. 05) in the SMA group than in the control group as assessed by the labeled monoclonal antibody against platelet glycoprotein IIIa. Complement activation identified by C 3 a and terminal complex C 5 b- 9 did not differ between the two groups, but C 4 a generation was less in the SMA group (p < 0. 05). Leukocyte activation identified by elastase and cytokine release indicated by interleukin- 8 were found uniformly in both groups. Postoperatively, chest tube drainage, blood transfusion, duration of ventilatory support, as well as the intensive care unit and hospital stay were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions. These preliminary clinical results suggest that SMA inhibits platelet interaction with the biomaterial surface of the CPB circuit. Complement activation assessed by the terminal complement complex is not influenced by SMA.

40|$|Exposing the {{elastomer}} polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to {{oxygen plasma}} creates a very thin, stiff, and brittle <b>surface-modified</b> layer. Nano-scale crack patterns can {{be introduced to}} this layer with tensile stress. To optimize the pattern formation for a specific nano- or bio-technology research application, the <b>surface-modified</b> layer must be fully characterized. A characterization method was developed, {{using a combination of}} experiments and finite-element modeling. Phase imaging and nanoindentation with the atomic force microscope showed that the <b>surface-modified</b> layer was graded over approximately 200 nm, with an elastic modulus at the surface approximately ten-times that of the unmodified PDMS. Finite-element analyses indicated that the toughness of the <b>surface-modified</b> layer is extremely low (0. 1 – 0. 3 J/m 2) and that the embrittlement extends 100 – 400 nm below that of the measured layer thickness, signifying that the cracks may extend deeper than the apparent layer thickness. Variations of the nanocrack-patterning method were used to produce functional nanoscale patterns. First, <b>surface-modified</b> PDMS cubes and microspheres were uniaxially compressed causing their surfaces to be decorated with nanocrack patterns. Pattern formation, due to the distribution of tensile stresses in the <b>surface-modified</b> layer, on the cube surfaces was associated with friction at the contacts with the platens; whereas, for the microspheres it could exclusively be attributed to the changing cross-sectional area along the axis of compression. Second, an array of parallel tunnel cracks was produced in the <b>surface-modified</b> layer, when sandwiched between PDMS substrates, with an applied uniaxial tensile strain. The tunnel cracks functioned as tunable nanochannels when they connected pre-patterned microchannel reservoirs. Modulated fluidic transport of single particles between the reservoirs was demonstrated and electrical resistance measurements confirmed the nanochannel adjustability (from approximately 1 μm wide to completely closed). Due to the compliance of PDMS, surface forces were able to cause the channel and tunnel cracks to close, or heal, upon removal of applied tensile strain. The self-adhesion of the nanochannel walls due to surface forces was studied and the conditions for collapse were determined.
