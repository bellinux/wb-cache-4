40|$|Information {{is needed}} on {{potential}} biomass crops for marginal lands in southern Europe. The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate switchgrass establishment in four seedbed preparation treatments (sowing, rolling before sowing, rolling before and after sowing and no till) for two varieties (small and large seed types). A 4 × 2 split-plot factorial design with four blocks was adopted over a 2 years period. Trials were conducted in Bologna (latitude 44 ° 33 ′N, longitude 11 ° 21 ′E, 32 m a. s. l.), in a silt loam soil (Udic Ustochreps fine silty, mixed, mesic). In general, emergence was lower in the autumn trials than in the spring one. Emergence on rolled soil (single and double) was statistically higher than tilled unrolled soil. Cumulative analysis of the two autumn trials including no till showed a significant (P≤ 0. 05) interaction between treatment and varieties: the large seed variety had a better performance only with no till, particularly in the first year. Overall, if no till was not considered, no significant interactions between variety and tillage treatments were found for final seedling numbers. The statistical analysis on both varieties was therefore combined. Although the double rolled tillage treatment consistently showed a slightly higher average seedling emergence than the <b>single</b> <b>rolled</b> treatment, the final number of emerged seedlings was never significantly different. In all cases, the rolled treatments (single and double) had significantly higher final emergence rates than the treatment with no soil compaction. The average emergence index of unrolled plots was 20 % lower than rolled plots. A function was calculated to predict the seedling numbers at the end of emergence based on the seedling numbers at the beginning of emergence. Generally rolling was needed to obtain best switchgrass performances. In northern Italy both varieties had a good emergence when soil conditions were appropriated...|$|E
40|$|During the {{start-up}} of Run II of the Tevatron Collider program, several issues surfaced {{which were not}} present, or not seen as detrimental, during Run I. These included the repeated deterioration of the closed orbit requiring orbit smoothing every two weeks or so, the inability to correct the closed orbit to desired positions due to various correctors running at maximum limits, regions of systematically strong vertical dipole corrections, and the identification of very strong coupling between the two transverse degrees-of-freedom. It became apparent {{that many of the}} problems being experienced operationally were connected to a deterioration of the main dipole magnet alignment, and remedial actions were undertaken. However, the alignment alone was not enough to explain the corrector strengths required to handle transverse coupling. With one exception, strong coupling had generally not been an issue in the Tevatron during Run I. Based on experience with the Main Ring, the Tevatron was designed with a very strong skew quadrupole circuit to compensate any quadrupole alignment and skew quadrupole field errors that might present themselves. The circuit was composed of 48 correctors placed evenly throughout the arcs, 8 per sector, evenly placed in every other cell. Other smaller circuits were installed but not initially needed or commissioned. These smaller circuits were composed of individual skew quadrupole correctors {{on either side of the}} long straight sections. These circuits were tuned by first bringing the horizontal and vertical tunes near each other. The skew quadrupoles were then adjusted to minimize tune split, usually to less than 0. 003. Initially, the main skew quad circuit (designated T:SQ) could accomplish this global decoupling with only 4 % of its possible current, and the smaller circuits were not required at all. The start-up of Run Ib was complicated by what was later discovered to be a rolled triplet quadrupole magnet in one of the Interaction Regions. This led to a reduction in luminosity of nearly 50 %, as well as operational confusion until it was uncovered. By the time Collider Run II began, the current needed on the main SQ circuit had increased to 60 % of its maximum value. Some of the smaller circuits were also needed to fully decouple the tunes. With this history, several studies were performed early in Run II to search for strong local coupling sources like the triplet quadrupole, but without success. The strong corrector settings were indicative of a much larger problem than a <b>single</b> <b>rolled</b> magnet, and the locality of the error was hard to deduce from the setting of a global correction system. Several possible reasons for the increase in coupling were investigated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A <b>single</b> <b>roll</b> caster {{equipped}} with a scraper was devised to cast the strip with sound free solidified surface. A property of this single caster is equipment of the scraper. Semisolid metal on the free solidified surface was scribed by a scraper and the surface became flat. Center line segregation did not occur as the strip was solidified from single side. The AA 5182 aluminum alloy could be cast at speeds up to 40 m/min. Thickness was about 3 mm. Pressure of the unit width from the scraper was ranging from 0. 1 N/mm to 1. 0 N/mm, and these pressure {{was enough to make}} the free solidified surface flat. Roll cast strip could be cold rolled down to 1 mm. There was not difference between roll contact surface and the free solidified surface after cold rolling by a visual examination. Result of tension test of the roll cast strip was as same as that of D. C. cast and rolled strip. Deep drawing test was operated at the conditions both of the roll contact surface and the free solidified surface was outside. LDR (limited drawing ratio) was same at both conditions and they were 1. 8. Thickness of the strip was controlled by the roll speed, solidification length (length of the melt pool) and pressure of the scraper. The <b>single</b> <b>roll</b> caster is simpler than a twin roll caster. Rigidity for rolling was not needed for the <b>single</b> <b>roll</b> caster. Cost of the roll is half comparing a twin roll caster. The equipment cost of the <b>single</b> <b>roll</b> caster is more economy than that of the twin roll caster...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the ability of a <b>single</b> <b>roll</b> caster equipped with a scraper. The purpose of the development of the <b>single</b> <b>roll</b> caster equipped with a scraper is casting of the strip without centre line segregation and porosity and with sound free solidified surface. The <b>single</b> <b>roll</b> caster can cast the strip without the centre segregation and porosity. However, the conditions of the free solidified surface and the thickness distribution are not sound. The scraper was adopted in order to improve the free solidified surface. Investigation of the effect of the scraper and the properties of the roll cast strip is the purpose {{of this paper}}. Design/methodology/approach: A scraper was developed to improve the free solidified surface condition. The scraper scribed the semisolid metal on the free solidified surface to make the free solidified surface flat. The scraper was made from mild-steel-plate, and it was coated by the insulator sheet of 2 mm-thick. The scraper was pushed to free solidified surface by the constant load. Findings: The scraper was very useful to improve the free solidified surface. AA 5182 aluminium alloy strip could be cast at the speed up to 40 m/min. There was no centre segregation and porosity. There was no difference between the roll contact surface and the scribed surface. The mechanical properties of the roll cast strip were as same as those of strip made from D. C. cast slab. Hi-content Al-Mg alloy like Al- 10 mass%Mg, which cannot be cast into the strip by the twin roll caster without centre segregation, could be cast into the strip without defect. Research limitations/implications: Metal which was investigated was only aluminium alloy. It is not clear that this process is useful to other alloys like steel, copper et. al. Practical implications: This process may be able to be used instead of the D. C. casting and the twin roll casting. Especially, this caster is useful the strip casting of the Al-Mg alloy. Originality/value: The <b>single</b> <b>roll</b> caster equipped with a scraper is original development. This caster may be useful for aluminium and magnesium sheet making companies...|$|R
