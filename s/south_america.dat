5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} have {{found evidence of}} domestication of Cucurbita going back over 8,000 years from the very southern parts of Canada down to Argentina and Chile. Centers of domestication stretch from the Mississippi River watershed and Texas down through Mexico and Central America to northern and western <b>South</b> <b>America.</b> Of the 27 species that Nee delineates, five are domesticated. Four of them, C.argyrosperma, C.ficifolia, C.moschata, and C.pepo, originated and were domesticated in Mesoamerica; for the fifth, C.maxima, these events occurred in <b>South</b> <b>America.</b>|$|E

5|$|At present, {{the continents}} of North and <b>South</b> <b>America</b> are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have {{produced}} several scenarios {{about how this}} will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and <b>South</b> <b>America</b> is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and <b>South</b> <b>America</b> migrate toward eastern Asia.|$|E
