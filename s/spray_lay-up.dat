50|$|In the {{laying-up}} process, a {{layer of}} fiberglass mat is applied, and resin is applied over it. A special roller is then used to remove air bubbles. Air bubbles, if left in the curing resin, would significantly reduce {{the strength of the}} finished mold. The fiberglass <b>spray</b> <b>lay-up</b> process is also used to produce molds, and can provide good filling of corners and cavities where a glass mat or weave may prove to be too stiff.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fiberglass}} <b>spray</b> <b>lay-up</b> {{process is}} similar to the hand lay-up process, but differs in the application of the fiber and resin to the mold. Spray-up is an open-molding composites fabrication process where resin and reinforcements are sprayed onto a mold. The resin and glass may be applied separately or simultaneously [...] "chopped" [...] in a combined stream from a chopper gun. Workers roll out the spray-up to compact the laminate. Wood, foam or other core material may then be added, and a secondary spray-up layer imbeds the core between the laminates. The part is then cured, cooled and removed from the reusable mold.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to enable large part or high volume manufacturing processes to make consumer or industrial products from a cork reinforced polymer composite, similar to current applications of glass reinforced polyester. The low initial investment and high flexibility of the <b>spray</b> <b>lay-up</b> process make it an attractive candidate to study. A <b>spray</b> <b>lay-up</b> apparatus was successfully constructed and employed in manufacturing parts from a hybrid material composed of granulated cork, chopped glass strand, and a polyester matrix. The material was tested for tensile and flexural properties following relevant ASTM standards. The material was found to have a tensile strength of 4. 4 MPa and tensile modulus of 850 MPa. The flexural strength and modulus were 9 MPa and 830 MPa, respectively. Adding a fiberglass skin to the cork hybrid significantly improved its flexural strength. Additionally, a small turbine blade prototype was created as a proof of concept. It is recommended that further work focus on optimizing the hybrid material's properties, re-designing and optimizing the apparatus used for the spray-up process, and demonstrating material viability by manufacturing a cross section of a large turbine blade. by Benjamin J.

40|$|The {{aerospace}} industry is incessantly investigating innovative techniques to increase aircraft fuel efficiency. As {{a consequence of}} innovative efforts, the cost of flying is continuously reduced and the aircraft’s mechanical performance improved. To achieve an important weight reduction, the fuselage of aircrafts like the Boeing 787 ‘‘Dreamliner’’ is mainly made of carbon fiber based composites. Having a high material specific strength-to-weight ratio, carbon fiber reinforced composites are {{state of the art}} materials in the {{aerospace industry}}. The in-flight concern of having the aircraft subjected to lightning is an ongoing safety issue. In the event of a lightning striking the fuselage, localized melting of the composite will commonly occur, as carbon fiber reinforced composites are highly resistive materials. A current design solution to prevent the fuselage from extended damaging/melting is to integrate an embedded metallic mesh between the carbon fiber composite plies. Upon lightning strike on the external skin of the composite material, the electrical current dissipates through the metallic mesh, thus minimizing damages of the composite part to localized melting. In addition to the integrated mesh, another solution to minimize/prevent localized melting of the composite is to rivet relatively thick and heavy metallic protective plates over the components prone to lightning such as the nose and wing tips of the aircraft. To resolve weight issues arising from heavy riveted plates, it would be advantageous to deposit thin layers of conductive material on the carbon fiber based composite surface. Unfortunately, high operating temperatures of conventional thermal spray processes used to apply a metallic overlay would degrade the carbon fiber based composites. For the purpose of producing metallic coated carbon fiber based composites, a new innovative technique which combines Cold Gas Dynamic <b>Spray</b> and <b>lay-up</b> moulding of composites is envisioned. This current study presents {{a detailed description of the}} experimental approach developed to produce metallic coated composites and demonstrates the manufacturability of such components at the commercial scale. Technical prerequisites, such as obtaining a low resistivity metallized composite and producing an easily removable metallic layer from the mould during lay-up moulding, are essential for the production of such aerospace materials. The thesis results obtained at the University of Ottawa Cold Spray Laboratory show that highly conductive and dense metallized composites could be produced...|$|R
40|$|Titanium based {{metal matrix}} {{composites}} (MMC) reinforced by unidirectional continuous SiC fibers are attracting considerable attention for potential use as structural materials for advanced engine and hypersonic aircraft applications {{because of their}} higher specific strength and stiffness at medium and elevated temperature with respect to monolithic materials such as superalloys. Before these MMCs {{can be used in}} real applications, the deformation and failure mechanisms in the environment under which they will operate must be fully characterized. For aircraft applications, this routinely includes fatigue loading at elevated temperature. This experimental work describes the manufacture and the mechanical characterization of a titanium matrix composite fabricated by a two step process sequence in which foils (also called monotapes), consisting of uniformly spaced continuous fibers in a porous alloy matrix, are produced using plasma <b>spray</b> methods and <b>lay-ups</b> of these monotapes are then consolidated to form near net shape composite using a process known as Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP). The material investigated in this study was a unidirectional composite consisting of a titanium alloy reinforced with SCS- 6 silicon carbide fiber. The matrix alloy was of composition Ti 4. 5 Al- 3 V- 2 Mo- 2 Fe, commonly designated as SP- 700. The monotapes were produced by Inert Plasma Spraying (IPS). The preforms in the as sprayed condition have been investigated by means of optical microscopy in order to evaluate their characteristics (closed internal porosity, presence of non completely fused particles). The same investigation was performed on the composite specimens in the as Hiped condition. The results of such tests showed that was achieved a high degree of consolidation, no intra-ply de laminations, negligible porosity and fiber swimming as well as a good interfacial bonding without an extended fiber -matrix reaction zone, thus confirming the quality of the process used. In order to assess the mechanical properties of the composite, tensile tests were conducted both at room temperature and at elevated temperature (300, 450, 600 °C). It was possible to underline the improvement of mechanical strength of this composite system if compared with the properties of the unreinforced SP- 700 at the same temperatures. The fatigue behavior of this titanium matrix composite was also investigated. Fatigue tests were performed in air at a range of temperatures relevant to gas-turbine compressor operation, namely 450 °C and 600 °C and at different maximum stresses (as obtained from tensile tests). Tests were performed under load control, at a frequency of 5 Hz and R ratio of 0. 1, with loading under a sinusoidal waveform. Post-test microscopy was conducted on the fracture surfaces and on the sectioned samples of the tested specimens. Fractographic analysis was performed on all test specimens using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The fractured specimen was further polished parallel to the loading direction in order to reveal the damage near the fracture surface. It was possible to observe the different damage mechanisms as well as the importance of fiber bridging. The improvements observed in comparison with the unreinforced matrix alloy allow this composite system to be considered as a suitable material for future industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Engineering firm Pratt 2 ̆ 6 Miller have {{developed}} a new and previously untested carbon fiber/epoxy composite using a <b>spray</b> <b>lay-up</b> process similar to a process commonly used in fiberglass production. This new composite is made by using a pneumatic chop gun that simultaneously cuts the carbon fibers to a specific length and deposits the chopped fibers and resin onto surface of an exposed mold surface. The composite is then rolled down to flatten and better wet the fibers and then the whole mold is vacuum bagged at room temperature to cure. The flexural stiffness and flexural strength of the composite with 1 ” and ¾” average fiber lengths were found using three-point bend testing. The bend test samples had dimensions of 50. 8 mm x 12. 7 mm x 1. 40 mm as per ASTM 790 - 03 for thin sheet materials. Because initial tests showed that {{there was too much}} scatter in the data due to thickness variations within the samples, they were flattened using a belt sander to within 0. 1 mm of their average thickness. The material exhibited an average flexural stiffness of 28 GPa and an average ultimate flexural strength of 400 MPa...|$|E
