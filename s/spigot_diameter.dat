A total of twenty seven experiments {{were carried out}} by varying the parameters like vortex finder diameter, <b>spigot</b> <b>diameter</b> and inlet feed pressure. The effect of these variables {{on the performance of}} the 150 mm Heavy Medium Cyclone was investigated. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} achieve about 30. 1 % clean coal at an ash content of 18. 5 % at a feed pressure of 10 lb/in 2, vortex diameter of 63. 75 mm and <b>spigot</b> <b>diameter</b> of 31. 5 mm. The tromp curves obtained from operating the cyclone gave a probable error of 0. 04, indicating good separation efficiency...|$|E

Parameters which were varied included the vortex finder and <b>spigot</b> <b>diameter,</b> throughput and feed-solids content, but the feed size remained constant. The reduced-efficiency curve was found to be constant for all tests and the conclusion is that for constant feed size this curve {{is a function of the}} material being classified only for geometrically similar cyclones and is independent of the cyclone diameter...|$|E
40|$|A new {{mechanistic}} model on water split behaviour in a hydrocyclone {{has been developed}} based on the convoluted hydrodynamics of swirling flows in a confined environment. A comprehensive study has been accomplished on the genesis and subsequent distribution of G force based on the characterization of internal flow features of a 2 in hydrocyclone through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The difference between the magnitude of G force in cylindrical and spigot regions is taken into account as a new hydrodynamic parameter to compute the water split behaviour. Specifically, our analysis reveals a semi-empirical relationship between the water split with G force difference (ΔG), the vortex finder diameter (Dvf) and the <b>spigot</b> <b>diameter</b> (Dsp). The developed model is validated against experimental data and show good prediction accuracy. Unique aspect of the developed empirical model is that the underlying mechanism of incipient flow peculiarity is implicitly accounted to rummage the separation characteristics in a quantifiable manner. In addition to rationalize the flow split behaviour of hydrocyclones, this new hydrodynamic indicator seems promising {{to be used as}} a scale-up parameter in envisaging the separation performance for a given application...|$|E

40|$|Effectiveness and {{efficiency}} of hydro-cyclone separators are highly dependent on their geometrical parameters and flow characteristics. Performance of the hydro-cyclone can, therefore, be improved by modifying the geometrical parameters or flow characteristics. The mining and chemical industries are faced with problems of separating ore-rich stones from the nonore-rich stones. Due to this problem {{a certain amount of}} precious metals is lost to the dumping sites. Plant managers try to solve these problems by stockpiling what could be useless stones, {{so that they can be}} reprocessed in the future. Reprocessing is not a sustainable approach, because the reprocessed material would give lower yield as compared to the production costs. Particulate separation in a hydro-cyclone has been investigated in this paper, by using computational fluid dynamics. The paper investigated the influence of various flow and geometric parameters on particulate separation. Optimal parameters for efficient separation have been determined for the density of fluid, <b>diameter</b> of the <b>spigot,</b> and <b>diameter</b> of the vortex finder. The principal contribution of this paper is that key parameters for design optimization of the hydro-cyclone have been investigated...|$|R
40|$|The fines of sub-bituminous coals {{from the}} Cígeľ and the Handlová Collieries in use as steam coal in {{coal-fired}} power plant weresubjected to washing in a water-only cyclone (WOC) with the aim to obtain suitable input material for organic compounds extraction. The WOC with a diameter of 150 mm and a cone part consisting of three angle sections 135 °- 75 °- 20 ° was applied. Vortex finder (overflow) and <b>spigot</b> (underflow) <b>diameters</b> were of 68 mm and 14. 6 mm, respectively. Two basic products overflow and underflow were obtained. The third one, slurry or circulating charge was also considered into total material balance of washing. Thus, the contents of ash,combustible matter, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, CaO, MgO, FeTOTAL, STOTAL, SSULPHIDIC and As were determined in the products of washing. Subsequently,on the basis of analyses the recoveries of individual components into products of washing were calculated. The washing resultedin the obtaining of significantly deashed coal at the overflow of WOC. In such way a washed coal with ash content in dry basis of 6. 99 %at a mass yield of 20. 74 % was won {{in the case of}} coal from the Cígeľ Colliery. Similarly, in the case of coal from the Handlová Colliery andits eastern field the products with ash content in dry basis of 7. 70 % and 9. 01 % at mass yield of 29. 37 % and 29. 50 % were obtained. Finally, the washing resulted in over 90 % ash rejection and about 70 % total sulphur rejection...|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce their}} sulfur emissions, many {{coal-fired}} electric power plants use wet flue-gas scrubbers. These scrubbers convert sulfur oxides into solid sulfate and sulfite sludge, which must then be disposed of. Knowledge of scrubber sludge characteristics {{is necessary for}} the development of purification technologies which will make it possible to directly utilize scrubber sludges rather than landfilling them. This project is studying the use of minimal-reagent froth flotation as the purification process, using the surface properties of the particles of unreacted limestone to remove them and their associated impurities from the material, leaving a purified calcium sulfite/gypsum product. In the current quarter, research was focused on two different areas. The first part of this quarter the optimization of the feed slurry percent solids for the two inch water-only cyclone was completed. The optimization of the vortex finder, <b>spigot</b> <b>diameter</b> and inlet feed pressure was completed in the previous quarter. The second part of this quarter began the investigation of why water-only cycloning helps froth flotation performance. The hypothesis is that water-only cycloning scrubs the surface of the unreacted limestone. This scrubbing effect provides a clean calcium carbonate surface, which results in better flotation reagent adsorption. This study used the scanning electron microscope to investigate the surface of the unreacted limestone particles...|$|E
40|$|Hydrocyclones {{are widely}} used in the mining and {{chemical}} industries. An attempt {{has been made in}} this study, to develop a CFD (computational fluid dynamics) model, which is capable of predicting the flow patterns inside the hydrocyclone, including accurate prediction of flow split as well as the size of the air-core. The flow velocities and air-core diameters are predicted by DRSM (differential Reynolds stress model) and LES (large eddy simulations) models were compared to experimental results. The predicted water splits and air-core diameter with LES and RSM turbulence models along with VOF (volume of fluid) model for the air phase, through the outlets for various inlet pressures were also analyzed. The LES turbulence model led to an improved turbulence field prediction and thereby to more accurate prediction of pressure and velocity fields. This improvement was distinctive for the axial profile of pressure, indicating that air-core development is principally a transport effect rather than a pressure effect. An increase in feed flow rate will increase the air-core diameter by increasing the centrifugal force on fluid elements, which in turn increases the tangential velocity component, thereby lowering the pressure at the hydrocyclone axis near the apex. It has been observed that when the <b>spigot</b> <b>diameter</b> increased, the air-core diameter increased, since the tangential velocity increases when underflow diameter increases. As expected, a rise in the viscosity of liquid reduces the air-core diameter at constant feed velocity, by lowering the pressure drop over the cyclone. This LES turbulent multi-phase CFD model, once extended to particulate phase flow in hydrocyclone, would be a useful tool for studying design dimensions. More importantly, alternative geometries may be examined swiftly. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Hydrocyclones {{have been}} widely used to {{separate}} particles by size in many industries. Their flows are complicated and involve multiple phases: liquid, gas, and particles of different sizes and densities. A two fluid model, facilitated with the mixture model, has been used to study the flow in hydrocyclones under wide range of conditions and used here to study the effects of geometrical configuration and material properties of cyclones operated at different feed solids concentrations. The variables considered include geometrical configurations such as dimensions and shape of body, cone and vortex finder as well as particle density. The outcome shows a smaller cyclone results in an increased cut size, decreased pressure drop, sharper separation and higher water split. Both large and small spigot diameters lead to poor separation performances. Accordingly, an optimum <b>spigot</b> <b>diameter</b> can be identified depending on feed solids concentration. It is also shown that for all considered hydrocyclones, a better separation performance can be achieved by the operation at lower feed solid concentration. Further research shows that cyclone performance is sensitive to both length and shape of conical section. A longer conical section leads to decreased inlet pressure drop, d 50, and Ep, and an increased water split. When cone shape varies from concave to convex, a compromise optimum performance for the cyclone with a convex cone is observed with a minimum Ep and relatively small pressure drop and water split. A new hydrocyclone featured with a long convex cone is then proposed which can improve the performance of the conventional cyclone. The keycharacteristics of flow in a hydrocyclone are then investigated when vortex finder geometry including diameter length and shape varies. It has been shown that a compromise optimum performance can be identified with relatively small inlet pressure drop, Ep, and water split. Discussion is then extended to flow behaviour analysis under the effect of different density fractions. The origin of flow pattern and the motion of coal particles have been predicted and discussed. The effect of coal density variation on operational conditions and performance of the large diameter hydrocyclones are also studied in this work...|$|E
40|$|Ultra fines or Slimes {{generated}} as overflow in screw classifiers in {{iron ore}} washing plants are generally {{treated in a}} single or multi-stage hydrocyclones to recover iron values. The underflow of the hydrocyclones forms the concentrate which is generally used for pellets making due to its attractive granulometry and high iron content. It is found, very often, that the performance of hydrocyclones is sub-optimum due to the frequent choking of their lower <b>diameter</b> <b>spigots</b> (cut-point being 20 µm). This affects the overall performance of the washing plant. Considering the granulometry (d 80 : 40. 5 µm) of slimes, cationic reverse flotation of these slimes {{is thought to be}} apt to recover iron values by reducing alumina and silica levels. This is supposed to improve the productivity of the washing plant. As a prelude to detailed flotation studies, four cationic collectors which are generically same but of varying chemical composition are evaluated and tested for their performance in the reverse flotation of iron ore slimes from the screw classifier overflow of an operating iron ore washing plant in Bellary - Hospet sector of Karnataka, India. Basically these collectors are ether amines. A stage wise flotation is conducted by adding the collector in three stages. Starch is used to depress hematite. The performance of the four collectors was evaluated based on Tests of significance, namely,‘t-test’ and ‘F-test’ and modified version of Selectivity Index derived by Douglas to select the best one among them for further investigations...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} the work described in this thesis were: 1. To develop an improved multiphase CFD model for classifying cyclones and further improve understanding of the separation mechanism based on fluid flow and turbulence inside the cyclone. 2. To develop an improved Empirical model of classifying cyclones, covering {{a wide range of}} design and operating conditions. The multi-phase CFD model developed in this work is based on the approach reported by Brennan et al (2002) and Brennan (2003) using Fluent, and involves individual models for the air-core, turbulence, and particle classification. Two-phase VOF and mixture models for an air/water system were used to predict the air-core and the pressure and flow fields on 3 D fitted fine grids. The turbulence was resolved using both DRSM (QPS) and LES turbulence models. The predicted mean and turbulent flow field from the LES and DRSM turbulence models were compared with the LDA measurements of Hsieh (1988). The LES model predicts the experimental data more accurately than the DRSM model. The standard mixture model (Manninnen et al, 1996) and the modified mixture model for a water/air/solids system were used to predict cyclone performance. The standard mixture model was able to predict classification efficiency reasonably at low solids concentrations, but under-predicts the recovery of coarse size fractions to underflow. To improve the predictions at moderate to high feed solids, the author modified the slip velocity with additional Bagnold dispersive forces, Saffman lift forces, and a hindered settling correction for particle drag in the mixture model superimposed on an LES turbulence model. Several cyclone geometries were used for validating the multiphase CFD model. The modified mixture model improves prediction of the separation of coarse size particles, and the predicted closely matches the experimental in various cyclones. The particle classification mechanism has been further elucidated using the simulated particle concentration distributions. At high solids concentrations, the modified CFD model predicts the efficiency curve reasonably well, especially the cut-size of the cyclone, but prediction of fine particle recovery to overflow is poor compared to the experimental data. It appears that the fines are significantly affected by turbulent dispersion and the flow resistance due to the high viscosity of the slurry at the apex is not sufficiently accounted for in the modified Mixture model. The improved multi-phase CFD model was validated against two sets of experimental data available in the literature: particle concentrations measured by gamma ray tomography data in a dense medium cyclone (Subramanian, 2002), and particle size distribution inside a hydrocyclone (Renner, 1976). Large eddy simulation (LES) with the modified Mixture model, including medium with a feed size distribution appears to be promising in predicting medium segregation inside a dense medium cyclone. The CFD predicted sample size distributions at different positions are reasonably comparable with Renner’s (1976) experimental data near the wall and in the bottom cone, but differ considerably near the forced vortex region, and also near the tip of the vortex finder wall. The CFD model shows no air-core formation at the low operating pressure used by Renner, which suggests his experiments involved an unusual/unstable forced vortex based cyclone separation. The effect of turbulence on fluid and solid particle motion was also studied in this thesis. The resolved turbulent fluctuations from LES of the hydrocyclone at steady flow were analysed using ensemble averaging. The ratio of the effective turbulent acceleration of each particle size to the centrifugal acceleration was calculated for various cyclones, which showed that turbulent mixing becomes less important with larger particles. The trends in this ratio correlate with the equilibrium positions of the particles from the multiphase LES. The analysis indicates that the short-circuiting might be aggravated by turbulent mixing across the locus of zero vertical velocity (LZVV) against the classification force, and along the vortex finder wall into the inner upflow region of the cyclone. An experimental study of the “fish-hook” effect was pursued in various industrial scale cyclones to evaluate the effect of various cyclone parameters. The observed diameter at which fine particle recovery starts to increase is mainly affected by feed solids content and <b>spigot</b> <b>diameter,</b> but less influenced by feed pressure. The observed particle recovery to the underflow at the fishhook dip size, the bypass, is always higher than the underflow water split. Any cyclone variable that affects the underflow water split, will also affect the bypass value. CFD studies showing high particle Reynolds numbers for coarse particles were used to provide a qualitative mechanism for fines reporting to the underflow in the wakes behind the larger particles (Tang et all. 1992). The Frachon and Cilliers (1999) model was used to fit and evaluate the fishhook parameters. The variations of these fishhook parameters were quantified for changes in cyclone design and operating conditions. The development of an improved empirical hydrocyclone model was attempted by collecting extensive historical data covering a wide range of cyclones. Additional experiments on 10 and 20 inch Krebs cyclones were performed to fill the gaps in the database, especially at low to moderate feed solids concentration and with different cone sections. Tangential velocity, turbulent diffusion, slurry viscosity and particle hindered settling correlations were identified from CFD as the key inputs to the particle classification mechanism for the empirical model. A new cyclone model structure based on a dimensionless approach has been developed. The model for,, Q gives a very good fit to the data, while the model for separation sharpness gave reasonable correlations with the cyclone design and operating conditions. 208 additional data sets were used to validate the new hydrocyclone model...|$|E
