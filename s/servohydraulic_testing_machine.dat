40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} methodology for accelerated {{testing in the}} area of high-temperature creep and oxidation resistance for thin-gauge superalloy materials. Traditional long-term creep (stress-relaxation) and oxidation tests are completed to establish a baseline. The temperature range used in this study is between 1200 and 1700 °F. The alloys investigated are Incoloy MA 956, Waspaloy, Haynes 214, Haynes 242, Haynes 230, and Incoloy 718. The traditional creep test involves loading the specimens to a constant test mandrel radius of curvature, and measuring the retained radius of curvature as a function of time. The accelerated creep <b>test</b> uses a <b>servohydraulic</b> <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> to conduct single specimen, variable strain-rate load relaxation experiments. Standard metallographic evaluations are used to determine extent and morphology of attack in the traditional oxidation tests, while the accelerated oxidation test utilizes thermogravimetric analysis to obtain oxidation rate data. The traditional long-term creep testing indicates that the mechanically-alloyed material Incoloy MA 956 and Haynes alloy 214 may be suitable for long-term, high-temperature (above 1400 °F) structural applications. The accelerated creep test produced a continuous linear function of log stress versus strain rate which can be used to calculate creep rate. The long-term and traditional oxidation tests indicate that Al 2 O 3 scale formers such as Incoloy MA 956 and Haynes 214 are much more resistant to high-temperature oxidation than Cr 2 O 3 scale formers such as Waspaloy. Both accelerated tests can be completed within roughly one day, and can evaluate multiple test temperatures using standardized single specimens. These simple experiments can be correlated with traditional long-term tests which require years to complete. ...|$|R

Classically, wool dressing is applied to the limb before the PoP, which can then be moulded to the desired shape. A modification of this practice is to wrap the PoP bandages circumferentially in cotton before wetting and applying to the patient in an attempt to reduce inhalation of plaster dust and reduce mess. However, this may affect the water content of the cast and therefore also its setting properties and strength. This study compared the setting properties of PoP casts when used with and without cotton wrapping. Methods: Sixty specimens, compliant with the American Society for Testing and Materials standards for three-point bending tests, were prepared, with thirty wrapped in cotton.

The microstructures of the ultrafine-grained and coarse-grained materials were investigated prior to and after the compression tests using a transmission electron microscope.

Although clinical theory suggests that manually performed techniques can predict or detect intervertebral motion, this hypothesis remains untested. Methods. Using a precision opto-electronic camera system and a custom spine <b>testing</b> <b>machine,</b> we measured intervertebral range of motion, neutral zone motion and three-dimensional flexibility in eight T 5 –T 8 cadaveric specimens (mean age = 81 years).

Findings. There was a strong significant inverse relationship between stiffness during cyclic posteroanterior loading of T 6 and flexion or extension range of motion of T 6 relative to T 7 (r = − 0. 88, P < 0. 01, extension; r = − 0. 81, P = 0. 01, flexion), and T 6 –T 7 flexibility in all six directions.

UFG aluminum is prone to necking at very low strain levels due to its inability to strain harden. Although necking commences almost immediately after yielding, the material is capable of deforming plastically to relatively large plastic strains before final failure. One problem with the tensile Hopkinson Split Bar method with dog-bone specimens is the inaccurate strain measurement due to the deformation taking place outside the specimen gauge section. Strain measurement inaccuracy can, however, be overcome by monitoring the deformation with the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method, which gives the full field strain distribution of the sample surface. In this work, Aramis® 3 D image correlation software with two digital high speed cameras was used for the full field strain measurements. Accurate strain measurement enables, among other things, determination of the strain rate distribution and dynamical necking {{behavior of}} the specimen.

METHODS: A computed tomography (CT) scan of each T 13 -L 3 spinal segment was performed. A loading simulator for flexibility {{analysis was used to}} determine the range of motion (ROM) and neutral zone (NZ) during flexion/extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation.

RESULTS: Statistically significant increases in ROM and NZ (P <. 05) were detected during flexion/extension and lateral bending when PLC was performed. A significant increase in ROM (P <. 001) was noted during axial rotation and flexion after PLC and hemilaminectomy. Stiffness decreased significantly during compression and dorsoventral shear after each procedure. Decreased stiffness during lateral shear was only significant after a combination of both procedures.

The material models that were developed was also used to study the rate dependent response of graphite/glass hybrid composites. High strain rate experiments were then conducted using the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar in which strain rates of the order 1000 /S were achieved. Three dimensional incremental equations of viscoplasticity were developed and implemented into a finite element code. Finite element predictions show that the proposed viscoplasticity model adequately models the high strain rate response of these material systems over a spectrum of strain rates. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe fatigue {{strength}} and the transition of failure mechanism from the high cycle fatigue (HCF) to the very high cycle fatigue regime (VHCF) for EN AW 6056 were investigated at mechanically polished, smooth specimens. Fatigue tests were conducted with a <b>servohydraulic</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> and a resonant frequency machine at room temperature. Tests run up to a maximum number of cycles N= 2 ⋅ 108. The results reveal that the {{fatigue strength}} decreases with increasing number of cycles, which is known for materials with facecentred cubic lattice. In the very high cycle regime the crack initiation sites of the smooth specimens were internal. Fracture surface and microstructure of the crack initiation sites were investigated by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), electron back scatter diffraction analysis (EBSD) and metallographic methods. The influence of notches was investigated at slightly notched (Kt= 1. 75) and sharp notched (screws M 10, Kt= 4. 7) specimens. The influence of compressive residual stresses was investigated by a comparison of precision-turned and shot-peened, slightly notched specimens as well as screws of with thread rolling before heat treatment and thread rolling after heat treatment. The fatigue strength of the specimens without compressive residual stresses decreases with increasing number of cycles. The fatigue strength of the specimens with compressive residual stresses shows a horizontal SN-curve after a point of deflection. The crack initiation sites of the notched specimens were always {{at the root of}} the notch independent of the compressive residual stresses and the number of cycles...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the stability of dual-taper modular implants following impaction forces delivered at varying locations as measured by the distraction forces required to disassemble the components. MethodsDistraction of the head-neck and neck-stem (NS) tapers of dual-taper modular implants with 0 °, 8 °, and 15 ° neck angles were measured utilizing a custom-made distraction fixture attached to a <b>servohydraulic</b> materials <b>test</b> <b>machine.</b> Distraction was measured after hand pressing the components as well as following a simulated firm hammer blow impaction. Impacts to the 0 °, 8 °, 15 ° necks were directed axially in line with the neck, 10 ° anterior, and 10 ° proximal to the axis of the neck, respectively. ResultsImpaction increased the range of NS component distraction forces when compared to hand pressed components (1125 - 1743 N vs 248 - 302 N, respectively). Off-axis impacts resulted in significantly reduced mean (± 95 % confidence interval) distraction forces (8 ° neck, 1125 ± 117 N; 15 ° neck, 1212 ± 73 N), which were up to 35 % lower than the mean distraction force for axial impacts to the 0 ° neck (1743 ± 138 N). ConclusionsDirection of impaction influences stability of the modular interface. The greatest stability was achieved with impaction directed in line with the longitudinal axis of the taper junction. Off-axis impaction of the 8 ° and 15 ° neck led to significantly reduced stability at the NS. Improving stability of dual-taper modular hip prostheses with appropriately directed impaction may help to minimize micromotion, component settling, fretting corrosion, and subsequent failure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether one can achieve stable fixation of a two column (transverse) acetabular fracture by only fixing a single column with a locking plate and unicortical locking screws. We hypothesized that a locking plate applied to the anterior column of a transverse acetabular fracture would create a construct that is more rigid than a non-locking plate, and that this construct would be biomechanically comparable to two column fixation. Methods Using urethane foam models of the pelvis, we simulated transverse acetabular fractures and stabilized them with 1) an anterior column plate with bicortical screws, 2) an anterior locking plate with unicortical screws, 3) an anterior plate and posterior column lag screw, and 4) a posterior plate with an anterior column lag screw. These constructs were mechanically loaded on a <b>servohydraulic</b> material <b>testing</b> <b>machine.</b> Construct stiffness and fracture displacement were measured. Result and Discussion We found that two column fixation is 54 % stiffer than a single column fixation with a conventional plate with bicortical screws. There was no significant difference between fixation with an anterior column locking plate with unicortical screws and an anterior plate with posterior column lag screw. We detected a non-significant trend towards more stiffness for the anterior locking plate compared to the anterior non-locking plate. Conclusion In conclusion, a locking plate construct of the anterior column provides less stability than a traditional both column construct with posterior plate and anterior column lag screw. However, the locking construct offers greater strength than a non-locking, bicortical construct, which in addition often requires extensive contouring and its application is oftentimes accompanied by the risk of neurovascular damage. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In {{case when}} {{surgical}} cement {{is used to}} fix endoprostheses of joints the fatigue character of mechanicalinterraction in the cement {{seems to be a}} significant importance. The paper suggests to adapt the research methodof low cycle fatigue for modelling the loads on surgical cements in an artificial hip joint. Surgical cements havealso been modified in order to improve their functional properties. Design/methodology/approach: Low cycle fatigue tests were conducted on samples made from Palamedcement without an addition and on samples modified with glassy carbon and titanium. The tests were conductedon a <b>servohydraulic</b> fatigue <b>testing</b> <b>machine,</b> MTS- 810, with displacement control. Findings: Fatigue tests proved viscoelastic character of all the tested materials. During the fatigue tests, thephenomenon of stress cyclic relaxation was observed. Research limitations/implications: Modelling the loadings of cement in endoprostheses of joints with the lowcycle fatigue method takes into account all high value stresses, while cement is being used for endoprosthesesfor many years in the conditions of random stress and deformation courses. Therefore the obtained stress anddeformation values are bigger than those which would have been obtained in real conditions in the same time. Practical implications: The low cycle fatigue tests carried out showed how important is the factor of timefor the behavior of surgical cement in the conditions of changeable loadings. This fact is essential to assessits usability for endoprosthesoplasty of joints, specially of a hip joint. Post deformation return which is acharacteristic feature for material viscoelasticity enables its regeneration conditioning expected durability ofendoprosthesis of joints. Originality/value: Low cycle fatigue testing method for modelling of loads on surgical cement in artificial hipjoint enables to carry out the tests in a shorter period of time...|$|R
