5|$|After {{five hours}} of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche resistance. Buffalo Hump escaped, but 70 Comanches were killed or mortally wounded, only two of them noncombatants. Ross's {{injuries}} were severe, and for five days he lay under a tree on the battlefield, unable to be moved. His wounds became infected, and Ross begged the others to kill him to end his pain. When {{he was able to}} travel, he was first carried on a litter suspended between two mules, and then on the shoulders of his men. He recovered fully, but experienced <b>some</b> <b>pain</b> for {{much of the rest of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and <b>some</b> <b>pain</b> relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{made his}} fourth {{straight}} opening day {{start for the}} Dodgers in 2014, only the fourth Dodger ever to do so. This season the game was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia. Before his second start, Kershaw felt <b>some</b> <b>pain</b> in his back and {{was placed on the}} disabled list {{for the first time in}} his career. He did not rejoin the Dodgers until early May. On June 18, he pitched a complete game no-hitter against the Colorado Rockies and struck out a career-high 15 batters. The only batter to reach base was due to an error in the top of the seventh inning, costing Kershaw a perfect game. He is one of two pitchers in MLB history, along with Max Scherzer, with 15 strikeouts in a game while allowing no hits and no walks. Kershaw was 6-0 with an 0.82 ERA in June and was awarded his third career Pitcher of the Month award. He was selected to the National League squad at the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his fourth straight selection. He was the sixth Dodger pitcher, and the first since Fernando Valenzuela to make the All-Star team four years in a row.|$|E

25|$|Imipramine affects {{numerous}} neurotransmitter systems {{known to}} be involved in the etiology of depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), enuresis and numerous other mental and physical conditions. Imipramine is similar in structure to some muscle relaxants, and has a significant analgesic effect and, thus, is very useful in <b>some</b> <b>pain</b> conditions.|$|E
25|$|Pain {{modulation}} – The {{reticular formation}} is one {{means by which}} pain signals from the lower body reach the cerebral cortex. It is also {{the origin of the}} descending analgesic pathways. The nerve fibers in these pathways act in the spinal cord to block the transmission of <b>some</b> <b>pain</b> signals to the brain.|$|E
25|$|The cornea is {{avascular}} {{because it}} must be transparent to function normally. Its cells absorb oxygen from the tear film. Thus, low-oxygen-permeable contact lenses reduce the cornea's oxygen absorption, sometimes resulting in corneal neovascularization—the growth of blood vessels into the cornea. This causes a slight lengthening of inflammation duration and healing time and <b>some</b> <b>pain</b> during surgery, because of greater bleeding.|$|E

25|$|Chihuahuas {{are also}} known for luxating patella, a genetic {{condition}} that can occur in all dogs. In some dogs, the ridges forming the patellar groove are not shaped correctly and a shallow groove is created, causing the patella to luxate or slip out of place, sideways. The knee cap sliding across the bony ridges of the femur can cause <b>some</b> <b>pain.</b> The affected chihuahua will hold its leg flexed, and foot off the ground until the quadriceps muscle relaxes and lengthens, after which the animal feels no discomfort and continues with activity.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{meta-analysis}} {{found that}} acupuncture for chronic {{low back pain}} was cost-effective as a complement to standard care, but not {{as a substitute for}} standard care except in cases where comorbid depression presented. The same meta-analysis found {{there was no difference between}} sham and non-sham acupuncture. A 2011 systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain. A 2010 systematic review found that the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture could not be concluded.

25|$|In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis {{stated that}} he at first regretted writing Scar Tissue saying “I did regret the book for a while as there was <b>some</b> <b>pain</b> caused then, I started seeing the long term {{positive}} reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools and it was having a positive effect. I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E
500|$|Pain {{control is}} another means to {{facilitate}} the elimination of secretions. A chest wall injury can make coughing painful, increasing the likelihood that secretions will accumulate in the airways. [...] Chest injuries also contribute to hypoventilation (inadequate breathing) because the chest wall movement involved in breathing adequately is painful. Insufficient expansion of the chest may lead to atelectasis, further reducing oxygenation of the blood. Analgesics (pain medications) can be given to reduce pain. Injection of anesthetics into nerves in the chest wall, called nerve blockade, is another approach to pain management; this does not depress respiration the way <b>some</b> <b>pain</b> medications can.|$|E
500|$|Lower {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} is {{also referred to as}} a bladder infection. [...] The most common symptoms are burning with urination and having to urinate frequently (or an urge to urinate) in the absence of vaginal discharge and significant pain. These symptoms may vary from mild to severe and in healthy women last an average of sixdays. <b>Some</b> <b>pain</b> above the pubic bone or in the lower back may be present. People experiencing an upper {{urinary tract infection}}, or pyelonephritis, may experience flank pain, fever, or nausea and vomiting in addition to the classic symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection. Rarely the urine may appear bloody or contain visible pus in the urine.|$|E

500|$|In January 1866 George was {{appointed}} headmaster of Liverpool College, {{and the family}} moved to premises in the Dingle area. Despite the new surroundings, Josephine continued to mourn for Eva but focused her feelings on helping others; she later wrote that she [...] "became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find <b>some</b> <b>pain</b> keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself.... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool." [...] She made regular visits to the workhouse at Brownlow Hill, an institution that could hold 5,000 individuals. She would sit with the women in the cellars—many of whom were prisoners—and pick oakum with them, while discussing the Bible or praying with them.|$|E
500|$|Eccleston {{felt that}} as a {{character}} his Doctor lives solely for the present. He avoids thinking about his past because [...] "there's <b>some</b> <b>pain</b> there" [...] – and his only concern regarding the future is that [...] "it's there". Eccleston felt that the character ultimately provides a life-affirming message stating that [...] "In everything the Doctor does, he is saying 'it's great to be alive'." [...] In an interview with Newsround he stated that the Doctor accepts individuals regardless of colour and creed and expressed hope that the Doctor would encourage young children to appreciate life. However, he also drew out differences between the Doctor and traditional children's heroes. The actor described the character as [...] "brutal at times" [...] and [...] "confrontational" [...] and [...] "inflexible" [...] stating that he [...] "sometimes creates carnage" [...] and that [...] "there's nobody like him in Disney". Matthew Sweet of The Evening Standard highlighted the dichotomy of the character being [...] "brave and wise and brilliant" [...] but also [...] "rough and ready" [...] and [...] "down-to-earth".|$|E
500|$|Josephine Butler (1828–1906) was an English {{feminist and}} social {{reformer}} in the Victorian era. She was especially {{concerned with the}} welfare of prostitutes although she campaigned on {{a broad range of}} women's rights. In 1864 her daughter Eva fell [...] from the top-floor bannister onto the stone floor of the hallway in her home; she died three hours later. The death led Butler to begin a career of campaigning that ran until the end of her life; she later wrote that after the death she [...] "became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find <b>some</b> <b>pain</b> keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself.... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool." [...] Her targets included obtaining the vote, the right to better education and the end of coverture in British law, although she achieved her greatest success in leading the movement to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases, particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy. She was also opposed to the forced medical examination of prostitutes—a process she described as [...] "surgical" [...] or [...] "steel rape". Her campaigning led to the suspension of the practice in April 1883, and the Acts were formally repealed in three years later.|$|E
