25|$|Ultimately {{the purpose}} of the {{campaign}} was to get grocery stores to donate the food they would otherwise throw away. The primary reason corporations have given for not donating their excess food is the fear of liability if <b>someone</b> <b>gets</b> sick from eating it. The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, shields food donors from liability and a 2013 study by the University of Arkansas School of Law shows {{there has not been a}} single case that involved food donation-related liability for a grocery store.|$|E
25|$|Although {{fighting}} is officially prohibited in the rules, {{it is not}} an uncommon occurrence at the professional level, and its prevalence has been both a target of criticism and a considerable draw for the sport. At the professional level in North America fights are unofficially condoned. Enforcers and other players fight to demoralize the opposing players while exciting their own, as well as settling personal scores. A fight will also break out if one of the team's skilled players gets hit hard or <b>someone</b> <b>gets</b> hit by what the team perceives as a dirty hit. The amateur game penalizes fisticuffs more harshly, as a player who receives a fighting major is also assessed at least a 10-minute misconduct penalty (NCAA and some Junior leagues) or a game misconduct penalty and suspension (high school and younger, as well as some casual adult leagues). Crowds seem to like fighting in ice hockey and cheer when fighting erupts.|$|E
25|$|Tensely, {{people watch}} for the hurricane's arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, {{if not for the}} {{pleasure}} of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts take it as a sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it's me, and if <b>someone</b> <b>gets</b> walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.|$|E

25|$|The band {{consists}} of 228 musicians. The block band seen at every game {{consists of}} 192 members, while halftime shows consist of 195 members. The other 36 members are alternates. These {{are members of}} the band who challenge the regular members every week for a spot in the gameday block. The alternates also understudy the week’s halftime show with the squad leader in case <b>someone</b> <b>gets</b> sick or injured before the performance. Alternates have a chance to perform with the regular band members during performances of Double Script Ohio, as well as during pre-game shows on away game trips. All music is memorized and verified during music checks each Friday. On game day the alternates help move equipment around if the show has props or a pit, otherwise they are led by the assistant drum major and stand at attention (minus instruments) on the sideline near {{the south end of the}} field. The band block consists of lettered rows ABCEFHIJKLMQRSTX and D. D row consists of one Head Drum Major, one Assistant Drum Major (who is the assistant to the Head Drum Major), and D-Row members who train and learn under the drum major in order to one day try out for the position.|$|E

In the Tibetan regions, the masses are living in such poverty that the elderly and children are dying of starvation or are so weak that {{they are unable to}} fight off diseases and they die.
