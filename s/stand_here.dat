This year has been unbelievable. I've been cheered in ballparks all over the country. People not only showed me their kindness, but more importantly, they {{demonstrated}} their {{love of the game}} of baseball. I give my thanks to baseball fans everywhere. Tonight, I {{want to make sure you}} know how I feel. As I grew up here, I not only had dreams of being a big league ballplayer, but also of being a Baltimore Oriole. For all of your support over the years, I want to thank you, the fans of Baltimore, from the bottom of my heart. This is the greatest place to play." ...|$|E
500|$|Starting on 8 December 1880 at Paardekraal, a farm to the {{south-west}} of Pretoria, 10,000 Boers congregated—the largest recorded {{meeting of}} white people in South Africa up to that time. [...] "I <b>stand</b> <b>here</b> before you", Kruger declared, [...] "called by the people. In {{the voice of the}} people I have heard the voice of God, the King of Nations, and I obey!" [...] He announced the fulfilment of the decision taken at Wonderfontein the previous year to restore the South African Republic government and volksraad, which as the Vice-President of the last independent administration he considered his responsibility. To help him in this he turned to Jorissen and Bok, who respectively became State Attorney and State Secretary, and Pretorius and Joubert, who the reconstituted volksraad elected to an executive triumvirate along with Kruger. The assembly approved a proclamation announcing the restoration of the South African Republic.|$|E
500|$|Miyazaki based {{some of the}} {{buildings}} in the spirit world on {{the buildings}} in the real-life Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. He often visited the museum for inspiration while working on the film. Miyazaki had {{always been interested in}} the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the Meiji period that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, [...] "especially when I <b>stand</b> <b>here</b> alone in the evening, near closing time, and the sun is setting– tears well up in my eyes." [...] Another major inspiration was the Notoyaryokan, a traditional Japanese inn located in Yamagata Prefecture, famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features. While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of Jiufen in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film, Miyazaki has denied this. The Dōgo Onsen is also often said to be a key inspiration for the Spirited Away onsen/bathhouse.|$|E

500|$|When the {{platform}} debate {{began in the}} Chicago Coliseum {{on the morning of}} July 9, 1896, Tillman was the opening speaker. Although met with applause and shouts of his name, he [...] "spoke in the same manner that had won him success in South Carolina, cursing, haranguing his enemies, and raising the specter of sectionalism. He, however, thoroughly alienated the national audience". According to Richard Bensel in his study of the 1896 convention, Tillman gave [...] "by far, the most divisive speech of the convention, an address that embarrassed the silver wing of the party as much as it enraged the hard-money faction". He deemed silver a sectional issue, pitting the wealthy East against the oppressed South and West. This upset delegates, who wished to view silver as a patriotic, national issue, and some voiced their dissent, disagreeing with Tillman. The senator alternately offended, confused, and bored the delegates, who shouted for Tillman to stop even though less than half of his time had expired. Beset by shouting delegates and one of the convention bands, which unexpectedly appeared and began to play, Tillman nevertheless pressed on, [...] "the audience might just as well understand that I am going to have my say if I <b>stand</b> <b>here</b> until sundown." [...] By the time he had his say, he had [...] "effectively destroyed his chances to become a national candidate". With Tillman's candidacy stillborn (only his home state voted for him), Bryan seized the opportunity to deliver an address in support of silver that did not rely on sectionalism. His Cross of Gold speech won him the presidential nomination.|$|E

Her presentation to the Senate focused on refuting the obstruction of justice charge and the House Managers' claim that failure to convict the President would damage the rule of law.

[...] Romney replied that after they found out the company used illegal immigrants, they let them go, criticising Perry's tuition credit for the children of illegal immigrants, adding that [...] "If there's someone who has a record as governor with regards to illegal immigration that doesn't stand up to muster, it's you, not me.". Romney also remarked that upon discovering that illegal immigrants were working on his property, he told the contractor, [...] "you can't have any illegals working on our property, that's... I'm running for office, for Pete's sake! I can't have illegals." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Colts' {{general manager}} Ernie Accorsi wanted Elway as, Accorsi later said, {{he did not}} foresee the 1984 Draft as {{producing}} any first-round quarterbacks. Accorsi announced Elway as the team's choice {{as soon as possible}} during the 15-minute window on draft day, surprising observers. Elway that day reiterated his wish to not play for the Colts at a press conference, saying [...] "As I <b>stand</b> <b>here</b> right now, I'm playing baseball". (When a reporter pointed out that the Yankees were not based on the West coast, Elway replied [...] "They play baseball during the summertime".) The Colts, however, were interested in offensive lineman Chris Hinton, who the Denver Broncos had chosen as the fourth pick in the first round. On May 2, Colts owner Robert Irsay and Accorsi agreed to trade Elway for Hinton, backup quarterback Mark Herrmann, and a first-round pick in the 1984 Draft. The Colts controversial relocation to Indianapolis the following year would later prove to somewhat vindicate Jack Elway's concerns, and that franchise would largely struggle until the arrival of Peyton Manning during Elway's last season as a player.|$|E

Clooney also appeared in the documentary film Darfur Now, a call-to-action film released in November 2007 for {{people all over the world}} to help stop the Darfur crisis. In December 2007, Clooney and fellow actor Don Cheadle received the Summit Peace Award from the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates in Rome. In his acceptance speech, Clooney said that [...] "Don and I … <b>stand</b> <b>here</b> before you as failures. The simple truth is that when it comes to the atrocities in Darfur … those people are not better off now than they were years ago." [...] On January 18, 2008, the United Nations announced Clooney's appointment as a UN messenger of peace, effective January 31.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara cited [...] (5:27–28 in NJPS) {{to support}} the {{proposition}} that God approved of the decision of Moses to abstain from marital relations so as to remain pure for his communication with God. [...] A Baraita taught that Moses did three things of his own understanding, and God approved: (1) He added one day of abstinence of his own understanding; (2) he separated himself from his wife (entirely, after the Revelation); and (3) he broke the Tables (on which God had written the Ten Commandments). [...] The Gemara explained that to reach his decision to separate himself from his wife, Moses applied an a fortiori (kal va-chomer) argument to himself.
