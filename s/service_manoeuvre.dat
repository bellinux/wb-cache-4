However, increasing the service orientation of a manufacturing firm {{to find new}} ways of value (co-) creation has presented several challenges, such as the fact that services do not provide the expected revenues, and resistance from both the sales force and from customers towards services. The aim of this thesis is to understand challenges linked to increasing service orientation in manufacturing firms, by means of goods and service business logics. The thesis emphasises the three dimensions of business logics – value perspective, service business strategy, and service offering – and studies them empirically in service divisions in the pulp and paper industry and in the automotive industry. The findings show that firms with inconsistency between the three dimensions face certain challenges. Most often, the firms have a value perspective of goods business logic, but a service business strategy and a service offering of service business logic. Therefore, the most important and most difficult challenge to overcome in order to increase a manufacturing firm’s service orientation is the employees’ value perspective. Three service manoeuvres were key to overcoming this challenge: changing employees’ mind-sets, starting to value services, and separating products and services. Although separating products and services could be assessed as a <b>service</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> consistent with goods business logic, it facilitated an increased service orientation. The fact that goods business logic manoeuvres led to a higher degree of service orientation, whereas service business logic manoeuvres did not always do so, is discussed as a service orientation paradox. ...|$|E

This study extends previous research on servitisation in individual firms by analysing the challenges service provision creates in a value network. The challenges are identified both within the firms and in the business relationships in the value network. In addition, the paper identifies and describes <b>service</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> firms use to address challenges resulting from servitisation. This case study of a value network is based on interviews carried out at 13 firms in the automotive industry, including suppliers, original equipment manufacturers and consultancies. The research shows that <b>service</b> <b>manoeuvres,</b> such as new types of resource integration and value constellations, are used to overcome challenges in the value network...|$|R
40|$|The paper resumes {{the results}} {{obtained}} applying various implementations of the direct boundary element method (BEM) to {{the solution of the}} Laplace Equation governing the potential flow problem during everyday <b>service</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> of high-speed trains. In particular the results of train passing events at three different speed combinations are presented. Some recommendations are given in order to reduce calculation times which as is demonstrated can be cut down to not exceed reasonable limits even when using nowadays office PCs. Thus the method is shown to be a very valuable tool for the design engineer...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{security}} is often analysed {{from a state}} centric perspective - sometimes as a sub part of national security. That approach disguise the heterogeneity and importance of different actors. This study analyse actor’s roles and capabilities that affect their own and others energy security strategies. The Swedish road transport sector is used as an example. The study also explores how a transition to a low carbon transport system may affect energy security strategies. Actors with three different roles are identified those that govern, operate, and use energy <b>services.</b> Actors <b>manoeuvre</b> at one or several (horizontal) levels (international, national, sub-national) and interact with different (vertical) stages of energy supply chains. Actors’ energy security strategy can be characterised as prevent, make resilient and adapt. A transition to a low carbon road transport system can empower actors at sub-national level and increase their capacity to adapt to change. It can also strengthen options available to increase resilience, depending on the organisation {{and structure of the}} system...|$|R
