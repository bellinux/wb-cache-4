5|$|Napoleon <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> forces southward in a {{wheeling}} {{movement that}} put the French at the Austrian rear. The Ulm Maneuver was well-executed and on 20 October Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered at Ulm, bringing the number of Austrian prisoners of the campaign to 60,000. Although this spectacular victory was soured by {{the defeat of the}} Franco-Spanish fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar the following day, French success on land continued as Vienna fell in November. The French gained 100,000 muskets, 500 cannons, and intact bridges across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|John {{initially}} {{adopted a}} defensive posture {{similar to that}} of 1199: avoiding open battle and carefully defending his key castles. John's operations became more chaotic as the campaign progressed, and Philip began to make steady progress in the east. John became aware in July that Arthur's forces were threatening his mother, Eleanor, at Mirebeau Castle. Accompanied by William de Roches, his seneschal in Anjou, he <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> mercenary army rapidly south to protect her. His forces caught Arthur by surprise and captured the entire rebel leadership at the battle of Mirebeau. With his southern flank weakening, Philip was forced to withdraw in the east and turn south himself to contain John's army.|$|E
5|$|Team Canada took {{a number}} of {{questionable}} early penalties. With two Canadians (White and Peter Mahovlich) off, Yakushev scored to give the Soviets the lead 1–0. The game was delayed after a mistaken call against J. P. Parise, (he was called for interference, but Parise admitted later he was guilty of cross-checking) and emotions boiled over. Parise was called for a misconduct for banging his stick on the ice, {{and when he saw}} the misconduct called, he dashed across the ice with his stick raised. Parise nearly <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> stick at Kompalla and got a match penalty. Sinden threw a chair on the ice. Some writers have commented that the incidents resulted {{in the rest of the}} game being refereed capably.|$|E

5|$|The {{events were}} precipitated by an {{incident}} in the previous meeting between the two teams, when Ottawa's Martin Havlat had <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> stick at Mark Recchi's head. Just under two minutes {{before the end of}} the game, enforcers Donald Brashear of the Flyers and Rob Ray of the Senators engaged in a fight. As they skated off to the penalty box, Brashear became involved in another scrap, and the rest of the players on the ice for each team, including goaltenders Robert Esche and Patrick Lalime began to fight. On both of the next two face-offs to restart the game, further fights occurred. The first of these angered the Flyers management, who believed that the fights were deliberately unbalanced against their players.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{settled into}} a siege of Atlanta, {{shelling}} the city and sending raids west {{and south of the}} city to cut off the supply lines from Macon, Georgia. Both of Sherman's cavalry raids were defeated by superior southern horsemen. Following the failure to break the Confederates' hold on the city, Sherman began to employ a new strategy. He <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> entire army in a broad flanking maneuver to the west. Finally, on August 31, at Jonesborough, Georgia, Sherman's army captured the railroad track from Macon, pushing the Confederates to Lovejoy's Station. With his supply lines fully severed, Hood pulled his troops out of Atlanta the next day, September 1, destroying supply depots as he left to prevent them from falling into Union hands. He also set fire to eighty-one loaded ammunition cars, which led to a conflagration watched by hundreds.|$|E
5|$|French {{fire was}} {{taking its toll}} on the British ship, and at 22:20, Amethysts {{mizzenmast}} was shot through and collapsed on the quarterdeck, smashing the wheel and impeding Seymour's command of his ship. Thétis began to pull ahead and Pinsum attempted to rake Amethyst in her disorganised state, turning sharply to starboard but coming to a sudden halt as her own mizzenmast collapsed. With their ability to manoeuvre severely hindered, Amethyst and Thétis gradually closed on one another, Pinsum ordering the soldiers on his frigate to board the British vessel and capture her, while Seymour prepared for the eventuality by loading his cannon with two roundshot and his carronades with double loads of grapeshot. At 23:00, Pinsum suddenly <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> frigate towards Amethyst, the bows colliding and rebounding and the French stern swinging towards the British. At his signal, the soldiers and sailors crowded onto the deck and railings, ready to leap onto the British ship and engage her crew in hand-to-hand combat. With seconds remaining, Seymour ordered his gunners to fire. The double-shotted broadside, fired at point-blank range, killed or wounded over 100 men, including most of the officers. Only four guns were still serviceable on Thétis, which was set alight in three places due to {{the proximity of the}} British muzzle flashes.|$|E

25|$|After Prenzlau, Blücher's {{escape path}} to the {{northeast}} was blocked. At Neustrelitz he <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> columns to the northwest and raced toward Lübeck. By this time, Winning's division joined him to raise his total strength to 22,000 men. The Battle of Lübeck occurred on 6 November.|$|E
25|$|Bhima <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> mace and {{shattered}} Dushasana's chariot. Bhima seized Dushasana, ripped {{his right hand}} from shoulder and killed him, tearing open his chest and drinking his blood and carrying some to smear on Draupadi's untied hair, thus fulfilling his vow made when Draupadi was humiliated.|$|E

25|$|Another {{incident}} occurred in 1958 {{in a game}} against the Washington Senators. Williams struck out, and as he stepped from the batter's box <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> bat violently in anger. The bat slipped from his hands, was launched into the stands and struck a 60-year-old woman— one {{who turned out to be}} the housekeeper of the Red Sox general manager Joe Cronin. While the incident was an accident and Williams apologized to the woman personally, to all appearances it seemed at the time that Williams had hurled the bat in a fit of temper.|$|E
25|$|Custer {{began his}} flank attack when the 15th New York Cavalry began their {{attack on the}} front and <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> mounted brigades around the Confederate flank. Before Custer could seize a {{position}} behind Corse, Rooney Lee led the 2nd North Carolina Cavalry (19th State Troops) and 3rd North Carolina Cavalry (41st State Troops) in a counterattack. Lee's troopers held their position, keeping Custer from joining the Union forces moving west along the Confederate line. Covered by Rooney Lee's troopers from Barringer's brigade, McGregor's battery, many infantry, wagons and ambulances and Beale's cavalry brigade withdrew north of Hatcher's Run.|$|E
25|$|When Vincent's column neared Rottenburg, {{he found}} the road jammed with the III Armeekorps trains. A charge by the Rosenberg Chevauxlegers halted the French cuirassiers long enough for his {{infantry}} to gain solid positions {{on the east side}} of the Große Laber. Hiller arrived at Rottenburg in the late afternoon and ordered a counterattack at 7:00 PM. Vincent <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> left brigade forward and quickly overran a Bavarian unit, capturing 300 troops. Soon after, the Deutschmeister Infantry Regiment # 4 got into a vicious firefight with Bavarian and French infantry. In the twilight, the Austrians were forced back by superior numbers with 600 casualties, but they had finally stopped their enemies.|$|E

25|$|Ramprakash {{completed}} his century {{on the third}} day, but only Rikki Clarke (35) gave him any sort of support, and Surrey were bowled out for 248. Surrey had a two-run deficit to catch up with, but they did it, mainly thanks to Jimmy Ormond. Ormond <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> way to 7 for 63, helping Surrey {{on their way to}} victory. Ormond reduced Glamorgan to 15 for 2 by lunch and 87 for 7 in the 19th over. Glamorgan recovered, but only to 173, setting a target of 176. Surrey sped towards their target and were 122 for 4 off 26 overs at close, Ramprakash on 49.|$|E
25|$|The two men {{moved to}} {{face each other}} within a few feet. At some point, Smith {{suddenly}} <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> rifle off his shoulder and struck at Reid. Whether intending to shoot at that moment or to club Reid aside is uncertain. Reid raised his left arm to block the fast-approaching barrel. It struck and cut his arm, {{but he managed to}} grab the barrel and yank it away from the general direction of his head and press it downward. The Daily Alaskan wrote that Reid grabbed the rifle barrel without being cut, but that during the scuffle, Smith pulled it free and hit Reid’s arm as he swung the rifle at Reid again.|$|E
25|$|Ramprakash {{completed}} his century {{on the third}} day, but only Rikki Clarke (35) could add more than 20 runs, and Surrey were bowled out for 248. Surrey had a two-run deficit to catch up with, but they did it, mainly thanks to James Ormond. Ormond <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> way to seven for 63, helping Surrey {{on their way to}} victory. Ormond reduced Glamorgan to 15 for 2 by lunch and 87 for 7 in the 19th over. Glamorgan's last three partnerships added 86, but the target was still lower than Surrey's first-innings score, with 176. Surrey hit at nearly five runs an over as they approached their target and were 122 for 4 off 26 overs at close, Ramprakash on 49.|$|E

25|$|An {{opponent}} of the British Empire, Hearst opposed American involvement in the First World War and attacked {{the formation of the}} League of Nations. His newspapers abstained from endorsing any candidate in 1920 and 1924. Hearst's last bid for office came in 1922 when he was backed by Tammany Hall leaders for the U.S. Senate nomination in New York. Al Smith vetoed this, earning the lasting enmity of Hearst. Although Hearst shared Smith's opposition to Prohibition, he <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> papers behind Herbert Hoover in the 1928 presidential election. Hearst's support for Franklin D. Roosevelt at the 1932 Democratic National Convention, via his allies William Gibbs McAdoo and John Nance Garner, can also be seen as part of his vendetta against Smith, who was an {{opponent of}} Roosevelt's at that convention.|$|E
25|$|By late March sports {{writers were}} already penciling in Landrith as the {{definite}} opening day starter behind home plate for San Francisco, but on April 3 Landrith had a freak accident {{with his hand}} in an exhibition game against the Cubs, suffering a hair-line fracture {{on the back of}} his index finger. He hit the bat or helmet of Cubs hitter Lou Johnson when Lou got out in front of the plate after a swinging strike out in the 4th inning. Landrith attempted to throw the ball to second base as Johnson <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> bat, causing the injury. Frank Bowman, trainer for the Giants, expected him to miss 10 days and opening day. He returned to batting practice on April 19 and pinch hit for the Giants on April 22 against the Cubs, but did not return to full action until almost a full month later on May 2.|$|E
25|$|Once {{atop the}} ridge, Hazen <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> brigade south. The Confederate lines in this {{direction}} were held by Brig. Gen. Alexander W. Reynolds's brigade, whose men had to endure a hard climb {{from the base of}} the ridge. Hit in front and flank, most of Reynolds's tired men melted away. Continuing south, Hazen flanked Col. R. C. Tyler's brigade of Bate's division out of position, allowing Wagner's brigade to reach the crest. Bate's Florida brigade was soon driven away, allowing Harker's men to reach the top. Col. Randall L. Gibson's brigade was defeated by Francis Sherman's men. Dogged by tough resistance and very steep slopes, Johnson's two brigades took the longest to climb the ridge, Carlin's men finally reaching the top around 5:30p.m. Seeing that his position was hopeless, Stewart pulled the brigades of Brig. Gens. Otho F. Strahl and Marcellus A. Stovall off the ridge.|$|E
