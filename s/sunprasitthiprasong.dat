40|$|Background/purpose: Many factors, {{including}} economic, psychosocial statuses and ethnicity, affect patients' {{decision to}} seek orthodontic treatment. The present study compared orthodontic patients' motivation, attitude and the factors affecting this motivation in Taiwanese and Thai patients. We investigated {{the association between}} the aforementioned variables and patient characteristics. Materials and methods: We enrolled 250 Thai and 250 Taiwanese patients (ageÂ â¥Â  20 years) from <b>Sunprasitthiprasong</b> and Taipei Medical University Hospitals, respectively, by using self-administered questionnaires. Demographic characteristics were analyzed using Pearson's chi-square test, patients' motivation, attitude and the factors affecting this motivation were analyzed using the sample t-test. The association among the variables was investigated by multiple regression analysis. Results: In both hospitals, the main motivation for seeking orthodontic treatment was esthetic concerns; the patients believed that treatment could make them more beautiful. Taiwanese and Thai patients rejected treatment because of high treatment costs and long treatment periods, respectively. A significant association was observed between household income and Thai patients' motivation (pÂ <Â  0. 05). Sex {{was significantly associated with}} Thai patients' attitude (pÂ <Â  0. 05). Age, sex, active treatment duration, and marital status were associated with Taiwanese attitude toward treatment (pÂ <Â  0. 05). In addition, age, household income, and information resources were significantly associated with the factors affecting Taiwanese patients' motivation (pÂ <Â  0. 05). Conclusion: Ethnicity influenced patients' motivation. Economic status was the main factor affecting Thai patients, whereas many factors affected Taiwanese patients' decision to seek orthodontic treatment. However, esthetic concerns were a crucial motivation for both groups. Keywords: factors affecting, orthodontic treatment, motivatio...|$|E
