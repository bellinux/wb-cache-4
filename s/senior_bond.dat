5000|$|Credit {{enhancement}} is key {{in creating}} a security that has a higher rating than the underlying asset pool. Credit enhancement can be created, for example, by issuing subordinate bonds. The subordinate bonds are allocated any losses from the collateral before losses are allocated to the <b>senior</b> <b>bonds,</b> thus giving <b>senior</b> <b>bonds</b> a credit enhancement. As a result, {{it is possible for}} defaults to occur in repayment of the underlying assets without affecting payments to holders of the <b>senior</b> <b>bonds.</b> Also, many deals, typically those involving riskier collateral, such as subprime and Alt-A mortgages, use over-collateralization as well as subordination. In over-collateralization, the balance of the underlying assets (e.g., loans) is greater than the balance of the bonds, thus creating excess interest in the deal which acts as a [...] "cushion" [...] against reduction in value of the underlying assets. Excess interest can be used to offset collateral losses before losses are allocated to bondholders, thus providing another credit enhancement. A further credit enhancement involves the use of derivatives such as swap transactions, which effectively provide insurance, for a set fee, against a decrease in value.|$|R
25|$|Subordinated {{bonds are}} those that have a lower {{priority}} than other bonds of the issuer in case of liquidation. In case of bankruptcy, there is a hierarchy of creditors. First the liquidator is paid, then government taxes, etc. The first bond holders in line to be paid are those holding what is called <b>senior</b> <b>bonds.</b> After they have been paid, the subordinated bond holders are paid. As a result, the risk is higher. Therefore, subordinated bonds usually have a lower credit rating than <b>senior</b> <b>bonds.</b> The main examples of subordinated bonds {{can be found in}} bonds issued by banks, and asset-backed securities. The latter are often issued in tranches. The senior tranches get paid back first, the subordinated tranches later.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} form of credit {{protection}} is called credit tranching. In the simplest case, credit tranching means that any credit losses will be absorbed by the most junior class of bondholders until the principal value of their investment reaches zero. If this occurs, the next class of bonds absorb credit losses, and so forth, until finally the <b>senior</b> <b>bonds</b> begin to experience losses. More frequently, a deal is embedded with certain [...] "triggers" [...] related to quantities of delinquencies or defaults in the loans backing the mortgage pool. If a balance of delinquent loans reaches a certain threshold, interest and principal that would be used to pay junior bondholders is instead directed to pay off the principal balance of senior bondholders, shortening the life of the <b>senior</b> <b>bonds.</b>|$|R

We argue that rating agencies may choose to provide only a coarse grid, and resort to somewhat arbitrary techniques to refine it. Consistent with our argument we find that the market systematically prices differently bonds of similar ratings, so as to account for the bias we discuss. Specifically, we find that yields of speculative rated <b>senior</b> <b>bonds</b> are higher than the yields of similar rated subordinated bonds. We attribute the yield differential between similar rated <b>senior</b> and subordinated <b>bonds</b> to the notching policy adopted by the major rating agencies. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the effect covered bonds {{have on the}} senior bondholders. We discuss how this new funding method is affecting the banks' balances and to which extent the senior bonds credit spread is influenced by different factors.

This new risk is reflected in the increased credit spread for senior bonds. As banks continue to transfer more of their mortgages, so does the risk continue to increase. Our analysis of the <b>senior</b> <b>bond</b> credit spread shows that the return of equity (ROE) has a significant effect on the credit spread.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} of systemic risk in Credit Structured Finance (CSF). Risk measurement issues loomed large during the 2007 - 08 financial crisis, as the massive, unprecedented number of downgrades of AAA <b>senior</b> <b>bond</b> tranches inflicted severe losses on banks, calling into question the credibility of Rating Agencies. I discuss {{the limits of the}} standard risk frameworks in CSF (Gaussian, Single Risk Factor Model; GSRFM), popular among market participants. If implemented in a ‘static’ fashion, GSRFM can substantially underprice risk at times of stress. I introduce a simple ‘dynamic’ version of GSRFM that captures the impact of large systemic shocks (e. g. financial meltdown) for the value of CSF bonds (ABS, CDO, CLO, etc.). I argue that a proper 'dynamic' modeling of systemic risk is crucial for gauging the exposure to default contagion (‘correlation risk’). Two policy implications are drawn from a 'dynamic' GSRFM: (i) when rating CSF deals, Agencies should disclose additional risk information (e. g. the expected losses under stressed scenarios; asset correlation estimates); and (ii) a ‘point-in-time’ approach to rating CSF bonds is more appropriate than a ‘through-the-cycle’ approach. structured finance, systemic risk, credit risk measures, bond pricing...|$|E
40|$|This paper values Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) in an {{equilibrium}} {{framework that}} explicitly incorporates the default decisions of homeowners and essential contractual features of MBS. We first consider Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs), securities created by dividing {{a pool of}} mortgages into senior and residual tranches. We find that senior CMO bonds can be risk-free, low-risk or high-risk in equilibrium, depending on the relative size of the senior tranche. We extend the basic framework to value CMO-squared, securities created by pooling residual CMO bonds and dividing the pool into tranches. We find that senior CMO-squared bonds are riskier than senior CMO bonds of the same size, when CMO-squared are created using residual CMO bonds. Finally, we value Credit Default Swaps (CDSs), securities that provide insurance against default. For house price data from the Case-Shiller index between 2006 and 2011, we find that senior CMO bond prices decline by 10 % and residual bond prices decline by 60 %. The price declines experienced by CMO-squared bonds are larger: <b>senior</b> <b>bond</b> prices drop 50 % and residual bond prices drop 100 %. The quantitative exercises suggest that default risk {{is an important factor}} for valuation of CDS written on residual CMO bonds, but not for CDS written on senior CMO bonds...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{modification}} to a baseline sovereign default framework {{that allows us}} to quantify the importance of debt dilution in accounting for the level and volatility of the interest rate spread paid by sovereigns. We measure the effects of debt dilution by comparing the simulations of the baseline model (with debt dilution) with the ones of the modified model without dilution. We calibrate the baseline model to mimic the mean and standard deviation of the spread, as well as the external debt level, the mean debt duration and a measure of default frequency in the data. We find that, even without commitment to future repayment policies and withoutcontingency of sovereign debt, if the sovereign could eliminate debt dilution, the number of default per 100 years decreases from 3. 10 to 0. 42. The mean spread decreases from 7. 38 % to 0. 57 %. The standard deviation of the spread decreases from 2. 45 to 0. 72. Default risk falls in part because of a reduction of the level of sovereign debt (36 % of the face value and of 11 % of the market value). But we show that the most important effect of dilution on default risk results from a shift in the set of government''s borrowing opportunities. Our analysis is also relevant for the study of other credit markets where the debt dilution problem could be present.
