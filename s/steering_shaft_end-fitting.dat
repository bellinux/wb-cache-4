50|$|A rag joint {{refers to}} certain {{flexible}} joints (flexure bearings) found on automobiles and other machines. They are typically found on <b>steering</b> <b>shafts</b> that connect {{the steering wheel}} to the <b>steering</b> gear input <b>shaft,</b> usually at the steering gear end. They provide {{a small amount of}} flex for a <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> within a few degrees of the same plane as the <b>steering</b> gear input <b>shaft.</b> It also provides some damping of vibration coming from the steering system, providing some isolation for the steering wheel.|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates in-cab {{sound levels}} {{from the power}} {{steering}} in a Volvo FH truck. The sound is most prominent when turning the wheels while the truck is parked. Previous research carried out at Volvo {{has shown that the}} main source is the hydraulic servo pump. It also showed that the <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> vibrations are fully dominated by the first pump order, whereas the in-cab noise is dominated by the second and third pump orders. The aim was to identify the transfer characteristics of different <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> prototypes and to study the influence of the steering installation from the steering gear and towards the cab interior in terms of noise and vibration. The work also includes a number of case studies such as the possible influence of the clock spring and driver introduced damping. Three different <b>steering</b> <b>shafts</b> and a <b>steering</b> gear has been tested in both freely suspended conditions and mounted in a previous field test Volvo FH timber truck. The <b>steering</b> <b>shafts</b> were excited with a shaker and the response measured in multiple positions, both as vibrations and radiated noise...|$|R

25|$|Normally the <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> is {{connected}} to the engine directly, instead of the output from the transmission. This means it spins at a relatively narrow range of RPM compared to the main drive <b>shaft.</b> The <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> is split into two output shafts through a clutch system that allows the outputs to spin forward, backward, or not at all. An idler reverses the direction on one side, so they always spin in opposite directions.|$|R
40|$|The {{intermediate}} <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> is {{very important}} part in the steering system. The steering system {{is a group of}} parts that transmit the movement of the steering wheel to the front and sometimes the rear wheels. The steering system of car is not only important for safety reasons but also to enhance the comfort of car's ride. The most conventional steering arrangement is to turn the front wheels using a hand operated steering wheel which is positioned in front of the driver via the steering column which may contain universal joints and may also be part of the collapsible steering column design to allow it to deviate somewhat from a straight line. In this project modelling of <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> is done by using Creo software and for the analysis ansys software is used. From the literature survey it is found that tremendous work is done on the steering system and its optimization but rarely work is done on the intermediate <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> or work on it is worth pursuing. So, I have taken this intermediate <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> as my M. Tech Project for the development in design or its optimization...|$|R

50|$|A paddle {{actuated}} {{hydraulic clutch}} was designed {{which had a}} custom master cylinder concentric with the <b>steering</b> <b>shaft.</b> Shifting was originally via a large off-the-shelf electric solenoid (actually two solenoids inline which acted in opposite directions), but the windings {{for one of the}} internal solenoids burned out the Sunday before the VIR competition (the team left on the Tuesday morning after this). Parts were gathered from old (~10 years previous or more) pneumatic shifting setups that were stored in various places, and the following day CO2 tanks and various other parts were bought at a paint ball supply store and a pneumatic shifter was on the car by 4am Tuesday morning. This system used the same switches that actuated the original shifter, which were mounted on a collar on the <b>steering</b> <b>shaft.</b> The shift paddles pushed small pushrods which were in holes drilled in the quick release and protruded when the paddle was pulled to push the microswitch levers.|$|R

30|$|The chassis is a force-path subsystem. By {{comparing}} different classic automotive {{structures for}} technical feasibility and cost, a chassis frame is designed using swing arm and leaf spring suspensions {{as shown in}} Figure  6 (c). The combination of the steering subsystem with the chassis is shown as Figure  6 (d) and 6 (e). The chassis links the steering system using interface E. The rotation is performed by the <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> and bearings.|$|R
25|$|The {{system is}} fully regenerative, {{all of the}} engine's power reaches the track either through the main {{driveshaft}} or the steering system, none of the energy is being lost to brakes or clutches. Additionally, since power is fed around the transmission to the steering system, in some designs the tank can be turned even when the main gearbox is not engaged. The limitation on this feature is {{the strength of the}} <b>steering</b> <b>shaft,</b> which has to be strong enough to move the tank if this feature is desired, but otherwise can be made lighter if this is not needed.|$|R
30|$|In this study, a novel step {{climbing}} {{method for}} a five-wheeled wheelchair, {{composed of a}} manual wheelchair and an active-caster drive system, has been proposed. Because the active-caster has the same configuration as a passive caster, an arbitrary velocity can be generated by controlling its wheel and <b>steering</b> <b>shafts.</b> Thus, {{the motion of the}} proposed wheelchair can be controlled in 2 DOF (two degrees of freedom) despite the single-wheel drive system. Moreover, by changing the number of points of contact between the wheelchair and the ground using a linear actuator, two types of motion can be accomplished, similar to front and rear drive modes.|$|R
40|$|The modern Steer-by-Wire (SbW) {{systems that}} have {{potential}} to replace the mechanical <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> between the hand wheel and front wheels with electric motors and sensors suffer from nonlinear dynamics and communication network time delays. In order to ensure a resilient steering performance under parameter uncertainties and network time delays, a robust fuzzy tracking controller based on Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) model is proposed. Using a suitable choice of the reference model, a fuzzy tracking controller is introduced to track a reference signal, and the H∞ tracking performance is guaranteed for a prescribed level for all external disturbances and reference signal.

25|$|The triple {{differential}} is {{a modification}} to the double differential, replacing the steering clutches {{with a single}} braked differential similar to controlled differential. This third differential produces any desired output speed in the <b>steering</b> <b>shaft,</b> compared to the double differential where {{the speed of the}} shaft is fixed. This output drives the steering idlers of an otherwise unchanged double differential, producing continuously variable steering. It has all the advantages of the double differential, with the only disadvantage is that the brake on the third differential dissipates some energy while slipping, but this is dependent only on the amount of energy being used to steer the vehicle, not the total energy being delivered to the tracks.|$|R
25|$|The Maybach {{system is}} {{essentially}} a simplified version of the double differential, or more accurately in mechanical terms, a double controlled differential.

Like the controlled differential, the brakes are normally applied to keep the idlers fixed. The steering inputs release {{one or the other}} brake to cause the idler to spin and that track to slow. Unlike the full double differential, the other side is not sped up so the system is not fully regenerative, and since both idler sets spin in the same direction, it does not offer neutral steering.|$|R

40|$|Automation of {{tractors}} due {{to their}} widespread use in different sectors e. g. agriculture, construction and industry have been seriously considered by researchers. In this study a tele-steering system for tractor was designed and constructed to controling and steering so the operator can control the tractor even {{far away from the}} stressful condition of tractor cab,. A CCTV camera and an electric motor were used in order to view the path and to rotate the <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> accordingly. Bilateral communication between the control center outside the tractor and control unit on the tractor was provided by a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). To evaluate the effect of relevant parameters on system performance camera position, <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> rotational speed and tractor ground speed were selected as experimental factors in a completely randomized design. Root mean square of error (RMSE) of lateral deviations and frequency of out of range around the reference route (Nout) were used as criteria in variance analysis. The results for two different ground surfaces with three replications showed that the performance of system had less sensitivity on soil surface and had better stability because of deformable structure and condition of soil compare to asphalt. Steering speed alone had no effect on the accuracy of tractor guidance. This is because the accuracy of the system mainly depends on capability, skillfulness and mental concentration of the operator. The position of the camera installed in front of the tractor had higher accuracy than that of rear camera. Moreover, by increasing ground speed the RMSE of lateral deviations and Nout increased and this is in agreement with the results of previous research works...|$|R
30|$|In the {{proposed}} step climbing method, the large wheels hover {{above the ground}} by adjusting {{the height of the}} drive wheel using the linear actuator, and this mechanism was confirmed in a previous study while a user sat on the wheelchair. In this process, the traction force of the drive wheel is not needed, and thus factors such as road condition and load distribution do not affect this method. With the large wheels hovering above the ground, the wheelchair can perform a stable translational motion by fixing the <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> of the front casters along the wheelchair frame. Thus, the advantage of the hovering method of the large wheels to climb the step, over the method that uses only the traction force, is confirmed.|$|R
50|$|The {{criminal}} charges {{focused on the}} car's steering column, which {{was found to have}} sheared off at a point where a modification had been made. The prosecution alleged that the column had failed causing the accident and the Williams team conceded to this failure, but only as caused by the crash impact. Senna had not liked the position of the steering wheel relative to his seating position and had asked for it to be changed. Patrick Head and Adrian Newey satisfied Senna's request by having the FW16's existing shaft cut and extended with a smaller-diameter piece of tubing that was welded together with reinforcing plates. The modification was carried out in this manner as there was insufficient time to instead manufacture a longer <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> in time for the race.|$|R
50|$|A body lift is {{a common}} and {{affordable}} method to run larger tires on a vehicle.(For body lift involving flight, such as airships or missiles, see Aerodynamic lift)It involves installing spacers where the body mounts to the frame {{in order to increase}} the clearance between tires and the body. This is often used to allow the placement of a larger motor for an engine swap. Body lifts can be built at home from components, or they can be purchased as kits from manufacturers. Properly installed kits are not easily noticed, while home built kits often look incomplete. Complete kits include brackets to realign the bumpers to match the body, and gap guards are purchased to cover the frame. Depending on the model of vehicle, they may also include <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> extensions and extensions for fuel filler necks.|$|R
