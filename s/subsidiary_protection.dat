30|$|When {{asked the}} {{question}} ‘Why Sweden?’, nearly all {{the participants in the}} country stated that it was the possibility of being able to quickly and easily resolve their statelessness through the acquisition of Swedish citizenship that was the most influential pull factor. Until the introduction of the temporary asylum laws in 20162, Sweden had very liberal naturalisation criteria and granted permanent residence to refugees as well as those granted <b>subsidiary</b> or humanitarian <b>protection</b> (Brochmann & Seland, 2010; Tucker, 2017). Refugees only had to reside in the country for 4 years to apply for citizenship and there were no naturalisation criteria based on language proficiency, passing citizenship tests, integration assessments or proving self-sufficiency for refugees to meet (Migrationsverket, n.d.). While in other states refugees can acquire citizenship in a shorter timeframe, for example with only 3 years residence in Greece or Hungary (GLOBALCIT, 2017), to benefit from facilitated access to citizenship, one must be recognised as a refugee. Recognition rates, as well as the granting of refugee status, rather than <b>subsidiary</b> or humanitarian <b>protection,</b> are very low in these states (Eurostat, 2017 c).|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} whether, in {{the context}} of armed conflicts, certain non-refoulement obligations of non-belligerent States can be derived from the 1949 Geneva Conventions. According to Common Article 1 (CA 1) thereof, all High Contracting Parties (HCPs) undertake to ‘respect and to ensure respect’ for the four conventions ‘in all circumstances’. It is contended that CA 1 applies both in international armed conflicts (IACs) and in non-international armed conflicts (NIACs). In turn, it is suggested that Common Article 3 (CA 3) which regulates conduct in NIACs serves as a ‘minimum yardstick’ also applicable in IACs. It is widely (though not uniformly) acknowledged that the undertaking to ‘ensure respect’ in a given armed conflict extends to HCPs that are not parties to it; nevertheless, the precise scope of this undertaking is subject to scholarly debate. This article concerns situations where, in the course of an (international or non-international) armed conflict, persons ’taking no active part in hostilities’ flee from States where violations of CA 3 are (likely to be) occurring to a non-belligerent State. Based on the undertaking in CA 1, the central claim of this article is that, as long as risk of exposure to these violations persists, persons should not be refouled notwithstanding possible assessment of whether they qualify as refugees based on the 1951 Refugee Convention definition, or could be eligible for complementary or <b>subsidiary</b> forms of <b>protection</b> that are regulated in regional arrangements. The analysis does not affect the explicit protection from refoulement that the Fourth Geneva Convention accords to ‘protected persons’ (as defined in Article 4 thereof). It is submitted that CA 1 should be read in tandem with other obligations of non-belligerent States under the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Most pertinently, all HCPs are required to take specific measures to repress ‘grave breaches’ and to take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the 1949 Geneva Conventions other than the grave breaches. A HCP that is capable of protecting displaced persons from exposure to risks of violations of CA 3 and nonetheless refoules them to face such risks is arguably failing to take lawful measures at its disposal in order to suppress acts contrary to the conventions and, consequently, fails to ‘ensure respect’ for the conventions.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{examines the}} impact of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) jurisprudence on the understanding of the EU <b>subsidiary</b> <b>protection</b> regime. It seeks to assess how protection is realised in the EU for asylum seekers fleeing indiscriminate violence, what gaps remain as well as potential avenues to enhance the effective application of the EU <b>subsidiary</b> <b>protection</b> regime. The study looks briefly into the origins of the <b>subsidiary</b> <b>protection</b> regime and the definitions of ‘subsidiary protection beneficiary’ and ‘serious harm’ as established in the Qualification Directive. It then critically analyses the findings of the CJEU in the Elgafaji judgment. The research further evaluates the scope of Article 3 ECHR and the ECtHR jurisprudence so as to ascertain what protection is available to asylum seekers through these norms. The analysis reveals that it is arguable that, through the latest jurisprudence of the ECtHR, protection under this provision is comparable to the one available under Article 15 (c) of the Qualification Directive as interpreted in Elgafaji. In a final section, the research considers possible avenues to define the added protection value of Article 15 (c). It cautions against an interpretation that would undermine the primacy of the 1951 Refugee Convention. It then focuses on the way the Strasbourg Court positions itself vis-à-vis international humanitarian law and supports that this approach could inform the understanding of the terms used in Article 15 (c) and could in fact safeguard the relevance of this provision.

This article, in turn, firstly, identifies those pro-migrant groups active in lobbying on both Qualification Directives; secondly, explores their lobbying strategies; and thirdly, assesses to what extent political opportunity structures affected the lobbying choice of the pro-migrant groups. Analysing the lobbying efforts of the pro-migrant groups on the original Qualification Directive and its post-Lisbon recast allows for an evaluation of whether the groups have benefited from the modified decision-making procedures.
