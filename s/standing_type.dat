6000|$|Beyond all doubt, savages {{who find}} {{themselves}} {{under the watchful eye}} of a moral deity whom they cannot 'square' will desert him as soon as they have evolved a practicable ghost-god, useful for family purposes, whom they can square. No less manifestly, savages, who already possess a throng of serviceable ghost-gods, will not enthusiastically evolve a moral Being who despises gifts, and only cares for obedience. 'There is a great deal of human nature in man,' and, if Mr. Im Thurn's description of the Guianese be correct, everything we know of human nature, and of evolution, assures us that the Father, or Maker, or Ancient of Days came first; the ghost-gods, last.

The darkest chapter of the reception of Luther’s Bible and his writings also has a place in the permanent exhibition: Luther’s anti-Semitic statements were frequently invoked in the Third Reich and put to use for Nazi propaganda. Founded in Wartburg Castle in 1939, the [...] "Institute for the Study (and Elimination) of Jewish Influence on German Church Life" [...] ("Dejewification Institute") made it its mission to draft new editions of the New Testament Gospels in which every reference to Judaism and the history of Israel was expunged. The outbreak of World War II kept the duration of the Dejewification Institute’s work very short. The institute’s publications were never widely circulated, either. The significance of the (Luther) Bible today and the challenges of the current revision of the Luther are highlighted in the final exhibition gallery.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a case of}} Charcot foot in a patient with long <b>standing</b> <b>type</b> 2 diabetes and complicated by peripheral neuropathy. It was initially diagnosed by an ultrasound examination and subsequently confirmed by an X-ray and an magnetic resonance imaging. Diabetic neuropathy is nowadays the most frequent cause of Charcot arthropathy, although it can be also a result of other diseases of the nervous system. In the acute phase the patient usually presents with edema, redness and increased temperature of the foot, which can suggest many other diagnoses including bacterial infection, gout, venous thrombosis or trauma. Because of its non specific clinical presentation and unsufficient awareness of the specificity of the diabetic foot syndrome among health professionals and the patients the diagnosis {{of this process is}} in many cases delayed. In the acute phase appropriate treatment needs to be initiated (mainly off loading and immobilization of the foot in a total contact cast), otherwise a rapidly progressing destruction of the bones and joints will usually begin, leading to fractures, dislocations and a severe foot deformity. Increased awareness among doctors taking care of the diabetic patients and appropriate use of the imaging methods can definitely improve efficacy of the diagnostic process and help to optimize the treatment of Charcot arthropathy. The standard approach usually includes use of radiography, magnetic resonance imaging and scintigraphy. In some cases a sonographer may {{be the first one to}} notice typical signs of bony destruction in a patient with Charcot arthropathy and suggest immediate further imaging in order to confirm the diagnosis and to minimize the risk of mutilating complications...|$|E

The single player will often camp for periods of play in a location that is easy to defend or has only one entry way, because this enhances their survivability when faced with superior opposition numbers. The other team will usually go into active hunting mode, expecting the single player to be hiding somewhere on the map. This type of camping is more accepted by gamers, {{because there is a}} valid reason for the outnumbered player to camp. By convention, when both teams are down to single players only, continued camping is frowned upon and both players are expected to come out and confront each other. To encourage this, some games such as the Battlefield (series) allow dead players to see the positions of remaining players on the map as well as allow dead players to speak. Thus when a team is down to a single player and the single player camps, team members may announce his location to the opposing team.|$|R

40|$|Background: Patients {{with long}} {{standing}} DM undergoing surgical interventions are put under great challenge {{as they may}} have cardiovascular and/or cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN). CAN is serious, often overlooked and under diagnosed, with possible arrhythmias and silent ischemia that threaten life. Objectives: Assessment of CAN in long <b>standing</b> <b>type</b> 2 diabetic women undergoing major surgery. Study design: Cross sectional study. Patients and methods: One hundred and six type 2 diabetic women scheduled for major surgery were assessed by the autonomic function tests. Only one hundred cases completed the study. CAN was assessed by analyzing HR variations during three standard tests (deep breathing, lying to standing and valsalva maneuver). Sympathetic functions were assessed by checking orthostatic hypotension. The CAN score of each patient was analyzed. Continuous 24 hour ECG monitoring (Holter) was done to evaluate ischemia, arrhythmia, QTc and QTd. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography, stressing on LVH, diastolic and systolic dysfunctions were carried out. Cases were classified as mild (with only one abnormal test) or severe CAN when two or more abnormal function tests were present. Exclusion criteria include any systemic illness that can affect the study results or the autonomic functions, smoking and HTN. Results: CAN was detected in 70 % of the studied cases, and 70 % were severe CAN. Postural hypotension was detected in 34 % of the studied cases. QTc prolongation and QT dispersion were frequent. ECG and Doppler echocardiography changes of LVH were more prevalent among patients with CAN. Diabetics with CAN were significantly older had longer duration of DM and higher HbA 1 -c, higher pulse pressure, triglyceride, uric acid and urinary albumin excretion rate.

MethodsWe studied two cohorts of people with long <b>standing</b> <b>type</b> 1 diabetes: GENEDIAB (n =  456) and GENESIS (n =  611). Subsets of the cohorts (n =  260, n =  544) were followed for 9 and 5  years, respectively. Outcomes were the incidence of end stage renal disease (ESRD), myocardial infarction, stroke and mortality during follow-up. Analyses were performed in pooled cohorts. ResultsThe prevalence of LEA at baseline was 9. 3  % (n =  99). A positive history of LEA {{was associated with the}} baseline prevalence of established (OR 4. 50, 95  % CI 2. 33 – 8. 91, p <  0. 0001) and advanced diabetic nephropathy (OR 5. 50, 95  % CI 2. 89 – 10. 78, p <  0. 0001), ESRD (OR 2. 86, 95  % CI 1. 43 – 5. 50, p =  0. 004), myocardial infarction (OR 3. 25, 95  % CI 1. 68 – 6. 15, p =  0. 0006) and stroke (OR 3. 88, 95  % CI 1. 67 – 8. 72, p =  0. 002, adjusted for sex, age, and cohort membership). A positive history of LEA at baseline was associated with the incidence during follow-up of ESRD (HR 2. 69, 95  % CI 1. 17 – 6. 20, p =  0. 02), and myocardial infarction (HR 3. 53, 95  % CI 1. 79 – 6. 97, p =  0. 0001). History of LEA was also associated with increased risk for all-cause (HR 3. 55, 95  % CI 2. 05 – 6. 16, p <  0. 0001), cardiovascular (HR 3. 30, 95  % CI 1. 36 – 8. 02, p =  0. 008), infectious disease (HR 5. 18, 95  % CI 1. 13 – 23. 84, p =  0. 03) and other-cause mortality (HR 2. 81, 95  % CI 1. 09 – 7. 26, p =  0. 03). History of LEA at baseline was associated with a 40  % reduction in the duration of survival in the subset of patients who died during follow-up. Population attributable risk of the history of LEA at baseline for total mortality during follow-up was 0. 31. ConclusionsPatients with LEA have a higher risk of ESRD, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality.

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) is an autoimmune disease {{that results from}} the destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic islet beta cells by autoreactive cells and their mediators. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the expression of Fas receptors (CD 95) on T and B lymphocytes from patients with type 1 DM and to assess the role of soluble Fas (s-Fas) in Fas mediated apoptosis of T and B lymphocytes, and to assess the role of glycemic control in renal and ocular complications. This study was carried out on three groups: Group I: consist of 16 patients with type 1 DM. Their age ranged from (11 - 18) years old with mean duration of illness 6 + 4 months. Group II: consist of 16 patients with long <b>standing</b> <b>type</b> 1 DM, their age ranged from 10 ­ 19 years old, with mean duration of illness 30 + 10 months. Group III: consist of 16 healthy persons their age ranged from 10. 5 ­ 19. 5 years old. Results can be summarized as follows: The incidence of positive microalbuminuria as well as incidence of retinopathy were significantly higher in group II (long standing DM) than newly diagnosed case (group I). Microalbuminuric patients had significantly higher HbA 1 C than others. Newly diagnosed cases (group I) as well as (group II) long standing DM type 1 had significantly higher percentage of T and B lymphocyte bearing Fas receptors (CD 95) as compared to control group. Mean plasma level of s-Fas showed a significant increase in both DM groups as compared to control group. There is no significant difference in the percentage of lymphocytes expressing CD 95, and plasma s-Fas levels when compared microalbuminuric to normoalbuminuric patients. There was positive correlation between HbA 1 C and microalbuminuria in diabetic patients, there was positive correlation between HBA 1 C and % of lymphocyte expressing the Fas receptors (CD 95). In both diabetic groups, positive correlation was found between HbA 1 C and s-Fas in DM type 1. Also, positive correlation was found between % of cells expressing CD 95 and s-Fas. In conclusion, the study of the possible role of apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes and its regulation, in the pathogenesis of type 1 DM may provide new therapeutic tools for the prevention of the disease. Further analysis, is necessary to finally settle this point, to elucidate the roles played by distinct immunological pathway in diabetes pathogenesis, this can lead to more effective and targeted therapies for the disease.
