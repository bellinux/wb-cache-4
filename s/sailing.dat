5|$|Chew Valley Lake <b>Sailing</b> Club has a <b>sailing</b> area, {{approximately}} 1.9miles (3km) long, for dinghy <b>sailing.</b> The lake {{is divided}} into two areas: a restricted summer area which is available during the fishing season (mid-March to mid-October), and the full area which can be used throughout the winter and on Sunday afternoons. The <b>sailing</b> area is marked out by lines of small white buoys. Racing marks are red buoys with flags, although large inflatable marks are used of open events.|$|E

40|$|Solar <b>sails</b> can be {{classified}} into two groups based on their method of stabilization: 1) truss supported, and 2) centrifugally (spin) supported. The truss configuration requires masts or booms to deploy, support, and rigidize the <b>sails</b> whereas the spin type uses the spacecrafts centrifugal force to deploy and stabilize the <b>sails.</b> The truss-supported type <b>sail</b> has a scaling limitation because as the <b>sail</b> area gets larger, the <b>sail</b> is increasingly more difficult to make and stow: the masts and booms get heavier, occupying more volume, and have increased risk during deployment. This major disadvantage limits {{the size of the}} <b>sail</b> area. The spin type comes in two configurations: 1) spinning square/disk <b>sail</b> and 2) heliogyro <b>sail.</b> This spinning square/disk <b>sail</b> architecture suffers the same <b>sail</b> area limitation as the truss-supported <b>sail...</b>|$|R

5|$|On 24 September, U-37 {{departed}} Lorient on Victor Oehrn's fourth patrol, {{in which}} he would sail to the North Atlantic. During this month-long operation U-37 sank six ships, four of which were in convoy at the time of attack, all of which were British. Five of these six ships were <b>sailing</b> under the British flag, while the sixth was from Egypt. The British ship Corrientes was sunk as part of OB-217, <b>sailing</b> from Liverpool to North America. Heminge was <b>sailing</b> as part of OB-220, also <b>sailing</b> from Liverpool to North America. British General was sunk while <b>sailing</b> as part of convoy OA 222, <b>sailing</b> from Britain to North America.

50|$|<b>Sails</b> may be {{classified}} as either triangular, which describes <b>sails</b> that either come to one point of suspension at the top or where the <b>sail</b> comes to a point at the forward end, or quadrilateral, which includes <b>sails</b> that are attached to a spar {{at the top and}} have three other sides, or as square. They also may {{be classified}} as symmetrical (square <b>sails</b> and symmetric spinnakers) or asymmetrical (most other <b>sails).</b> Typically, asymmetrical <b>sails</b> perform better on points of <b>sail</b> closer to the wind and are designed for fore-and-aft rigs than symmetrical <b>sails,</b> which perform best on points of <b>sail</b> that are further from the wind direction.|$|R
50|$|To {{catch the}} energy, Forward used a 1,000-km-diameter, {{circular}} aluminum <b>sail.</b> The <b>sail</b> resembled a flattened disk with a 300-km diameter removable center portion. When traveling to Rocheworld, the entire <b>sail</b> was used. When the ship needed to decelerate, the smaller <b>sail</b> {{was separated from}} the larger outer <b>sail.</b> The large <b>sail</b> {{was used as a}} reflecting lens, focusing light onto the smaller <b>sail,</b> slowing the craft.|$|R

40|$|Solar <b>sail</b> propulsive {{performance}} {{is dependent on}} <b>sail</b> membrane optical properties and on <b>sail</b> membrane shape. Assumptions of an ideal <b>sail</b> (flat, perfect reflector) can result in errors which can affect spacecraft control, trajectory analyses, and overall evaluation of solar <b>sail</b> performance. A MATLAB(R) program has been developed to generate <b>sail</b> shape point cloud files for two square-architecture solar <b>sail</b> designs. Simple parabolic profiles are assumed for <b>sail</b> shape under solar pressure loading. These files are then input into the Solar Vectoring Evaluation Tool (SVET) software to determine the propulsive force vector, center of pressure, and moments about the <b>sail</b> body axes {{as a function of}} <b>sail</b> shape and optical properties. Also, the impact of the center-line angle, due to non-perfect optical properties, is addressed since this constrains <b>sail</b> force vector cone angle and is often overlooked when assuming ideal-reflector membranes. Preliminary sensitivity analysis using these tools aids in determining the key geometric and optical parameters that drive solar <b>sail</b> propulsive performance...|$|R
