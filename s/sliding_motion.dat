25|$|The fox trot is {{most often}} {{associated}} with the Missouri Fox Trotter breed, but is also seen in other breeds. The fox trot is a four-beat broken diagonal gait in which the front foot of the diagonal pair lands before the hind, eliminating the moment of suspension and giving a smooth ride said to also be sure-footed. The gait is sometimes described as having the horse walk with the front feet and trot with the back. In a fox trot, the horse must keep one front foot {{on the ground at}} all times and display a <b>sliding</b> <b>motion</b> with the hind legs. Other gaited breeds are able to perform the fox trot and {{it is one of the}} only ambling gaits that can be taught to horses that are not naturally gaited. The gait creates an optical illusion that a horse is walking in front and trotting behind.|$|E
500|$|The Missouri Fox Trotter {{performs}} an ambling gait {{known as}} the [...] "fox trot", which replaces the trot seen in many other breeds. The fox trot is a four-beat broken diagonal gait in which the front foot of the diagonal pair lands before the hind, eliminating the moment of suspension and giving a smooth, sure-footed ride. The gait is sometimes described as having the horse walk with the front feet and trot with the back. In a fox trot, the horse must keep one front foot {{on the ground at}} all times and display a <b>sliding</b> <b>motion</b> with the hind legs. The fox trot and the regular trot are both at a speed between a walk and a canter or gallop; ambling gaits are four-beat gaits, whereas the trot is a two-beat gait. The extra footfalls provide additional smoothness to a rider because the horse always has at least one foot on the ground. [...] This minimizes movement of the horse's topline and removes the bounce of a two-beat gait, caused by a moment of suspension followed by the jolt of two feet hitting the ground as the horse shifts from one pair of legs to the other. The value of an intermediate speed is that the horse conserves energy. [...] More than thirty horse breeds are [...] "gaited," [...] able to perform a four-beat ambling gait; some can also trot. A Missouri Fox Trotter, with rider, can maintain a speed of [...] while using the fox trot, and can cover short distances at up to [...] In comparison, the average medium trot speed is [...]|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Servo press {{facilities}} {{are becoming increasingly}} used in industry and many attempts are being made to bring out their characteristic features for enhancing the formability of high-strength steel sheets. One {{of the most remarkable}} features of the servo press lies in its flexibility in <b>slide</b> <b>motion</b> control. It is thus effective to investigate the relevance of the strain rate sensitivity of a material to the mechanism of improvement in formability enabled by the flexible <b>slide</b> <b>motion</b> of the servo press. In this study, the Norton creep law was introduced in the FEM solver to take into account visco-elasto-plastic deformation including stress relaxation behavior. Parameters for the visco-elasto-plastic material model were identified through physical measurements and FEM simulations of uniaxial tension and crosshead displacement dwell tests. The identified material model was applied to sheet forming simulations of an automotive body part, and the validity of the model was examined by comparison with stamping experiments using a servo press with different <b>slide</b> <b>motions.</b> The numerical results obtained using the identified material model showed the same tendency with respect to the <b>slide</b> <b>motions</b> as the experimental results. Stress relaxation behavior was found to be an important factor for investigating formability affected by modifying the <b>slide</b> <b>motion...</b>|$|R

60|$|But, in truth, the {{pressure}} of any ambient fluid, how great soever, can be no intelligible cause of the cohesion of the solid parts of matter. For, though such a pressure may hinder the avulsion of two polished superficies, one from another, in a line perpendicular to them, as in the experiment of two polished marbles; yet it can never in the least hinder the separation by a motion, in a line parallel to those surfaces. Because the ambient fluid, having a full liberty to succeed in each point of space, deserted by a lateral motion, resists such a motion of bodies, so joined, no more than it would resist the motion of that body were it on all sides environed by that fluid, and touched no other body; and therefore, {{if there were no}} other cause of cohesion, all parts of bodies must be easily separable by such a lateral <b>sliding</b> <b>motion.</b> For if {{the pressure}} of the aether be the adequate cause of cohesion, wherever that cause operates not, there can be no cohesion. And since it cannot operate against a lateral separation, (as has been shown,) therefore in every imaginary plane, intersecting any mass of matter, there could be no more cohesion than of two polished surfaces, which will always, notwithstanding any imaginable pressure of a fluid, easily slide one from another. So that perhaps, how clear an idea soever we think we have of the extension of body, which is nothing but the cohesion of solid parts, he that shall well consider it in his mind, may have reason to conclude, That it is as easy for him to have a clear idea how the soul thinks as how body is extended. For, since body is no further, nor otherwise, extended, than by the union and cohesion of its solid parts, we shall very ill comprehend the extension of body, without understanding wherein consists the union and cohesion of its parts; which seems to me as incomprehensible as the manner of thinking, and how it is performed.|$|E
