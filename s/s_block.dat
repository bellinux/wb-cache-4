5|$|From left {{to right}} across the four blocks of the long- or 32-column form of the {{periodic}} table {{are a series of}} linking or bridging groups of elements, located approximately between each block. These groups, like the metalloids, show properties in between, or that are a mixture of, groups to either side. Chemically, the group 3 elements, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium behave largely like the alkaline earth metals or, more generally, <b>s</b> <b>block</b> metals but have some of the physical properties of d block transition metals. Lutetium and lawrencium, {{at the end of the}} end of the f block, may constitute another linking or bridging group. Lutetium behaves chemically as a lanthanide but shows a mix of lanthanide and transition metal physical properties. Lawrencium, as an analogue of lutetium, would presumable display like characteristics. The coinage metals in group 11 (copper, silver, and gold) are chemically capable of acting as either transition metals or main group metals. The volatile group 12 metals, zinc, cadmium and mercury are sometimes regarded as linking the d block to the p block. Notionally they are d block elements but they have few transition metal properties and are more like their p block neighbors in group 13. The relatively inert noble gases, in group 18, bridge the most reactive groups of elements in the periodic table—the halogens in group 17 and the alkali metals in group 1.|$|E

40|$|The {{controls}} {{of water and}} O 2 availability, microbial activity and temperature on acid (H 2 SO 4) production rates in commercial-scale sulphur (<b>S</b> 0) <b>blocks</b> were quantified and recommendations were made for minimizing H 2 SO 4 production in <b>S</b> 0 <b>blocks.</b> Acidic drainage from the <b>S</b> 0 <b>blocks</b> (pH 0. 4 - 1. 0) was attributed to mixing of fresh infiltrating water and low-pH resident water (mean pH=- 2. 1) with resident water comprising ~ 4 - 8 % of the drainage. Although clean S 0 is strongly hydrophobic, preferential water infiltration occurred rapidly through fractured <b>S</b> 0 <b>blocks</b> in which the bulk hydraulic conductivity {{was estimated to be}} similar to gravel or clean sand (Ks= 1 x 10 - 1 to 1 x 10 - 3 m/s). Microbial colonization of fracture faces generated localized hydrophilic conditions that helped create preferential pathways for water infiltration. Liquid water contact (compared to water vapour) was essential for S 0 oxidation (i. e., H 2 SO 4 production), therefore H 2 SO 4 production in the <b>S</b> 0 <b>blocks</b> was limited to fractures and friable S 0 through which water flowed. H 2 SO 4 production was greatest in the upper 1 m of the <b>S</b> 0 <b>block</b> (70 to > 97 % of annual H 2 SO 4 production) and the result of autotrophic microbial S 0 oxidation. S 0 oxidation rates were very sensitive to temperature and increased by a factor of 4. 3 for a temperature increase of 10 °C (Q 10). Therefore minimizing temperature (1 vol. %, the total mass production rate of H 2 SO 4 is approximately proportional to the O 2 concentration at the surface of the <b>S</b> 0 <b>block</b> (assuming in situ O 2 concentrations decrease t...|$|R

We construct an explicit linear mapping Φ that maps the (s, d) -block sparse signal to a measurement vector of dimension M, where s•d <N(1 -(1 -M/N) ^(d/(d+ 1)) -o(1). We show that if the (<b>s,</b> d) - <b>block</b> sparse signal is chosen uniformly at random then the signal can almost surely be reconstructed from the measurement vector in O(N^ 3) computations. ...|$|R
40|$|Adeno-associated virus Rep 78 protein has {{antiproliferative}} {{effects on}} cells. It inhibits cell cycle progression, and, in particular, Rep 78 induces a complete arrest within S phase, a response rarely seen after cell DNA damage. We examined how Rep 78 achieves such an efficient <b>S</b> phase <b>block.</b> Rep 78 inhibits Cdc 25 A activity by a novel means in which binding {{between the two}} proteins stabilizes Cdc 25 A, thus increasing its abundance, {{while at the same}} time preventing access to its substrates cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 2 and Cdk 1. This effect alone does not induce a complete <b>S</b> phase <b>block.</b> In addition, Rep 78, as well as Rep 68, produces nicks in the cellular chromatin, inducing a DNA damage response mediated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) leading to G 1 and G 2 blocks. Mutational analysis shows that the zinc finger domain and nuclease activity of Rep 78 are both required for the <b>S</b> phase <b>block.</b> The results suggest that a true <b>S</b> phase <b>block</b> cannot be achieved through a single pathway, and that adeno-associated virus Rep 78 protein arrests cells within S phase by interfering with two pathways that would normally lead to an S phase slow-down...|$|R
