25|$|In the Middle Coosa River Watershed, 281 {{occurrences of}} rare {{plant and animal}} species and natural {{communities}} have been documented, including 73 occurrences of 23 species that are federal or state protected. Ten conservation targets were chosen: the riverine system, matrix forest communities (oak hickory-pine forest), gray bat (Myotis grisescens), riparian vegetation, mountain longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest communities, red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), critically imperiled aquatic species (fish, mussels, and snails), <b>southern</b> <b>hognose</b> <b>snake</b> (Heterodon simus), caddisflies, and imperiled plants. Maintaining the biodiversity of the Coosa River system is particularly important because it has already lost a significant portion of its aquatic fauna to extinction.|$|E

50|$|The Western Hog-nosed Snake (Heterodon nasicus) is a {{harmless}} colubrid species found in North America and northern Mexico. The Western <b>Hognose</b> <b>Snake</b> {{is a light}} sandy brown in color, with darker brown or gray blotching, their coloration {{is not nearly as}} variable as the Eastern Hognose, Heterodon platirhinos, but they often have an ink-black and white or yellow checker patterned belly, sometimes accented with orange. They are very stout for their size (a full grown 24-inch female is as bulky as a five-foot corn snake) and can grow from 15 to 33 inches in length, with females generally being larger than males. The characteristic of all <b>hognose</b> <b>snakes</b> is their upturned snout, which aids in digging in the soil. <b>Hognose</b> <b>Snakes</b> are considered to be rear-fanged venomous, but are not considered to pose any danger to humans and will only bite as a feeding response, rarely in defense.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately due {{to their}} {{appearance}} and impressive defensive display, <b>hognose</b> <b>snakes</b> are commonly mistaken to be copperheads and subsequently killed. This {{is especially true in}} the south-eastern regions of the United States.|$|R
40|$|Because they hiss {{and strike}} violently when aroused, the {{harmless}} little <b>hognose</b> <b>snakes</b> are often {{considered to be}} poisonous by people who encounter them.

The University of Nebraska State Museum has recently acquired fossil evidence regarding the evolutionary history of these common Great Plains reptiles. We can now trace {{the record of the}} <b>hognose</b> <b>snakes</b> back to a time long before the arrival of man, the bison, or even the mammoth on the North American Continent...|$|R

25|$|<b>Hognose</b> <b>snakes</b> are {{extremely}} variable {{in color and}} pattern. Heterodon nasicus and H. kennerlyi tend to be sandy colored with black and white markings, while H. platirhinos varies from reds, greens, oranges, browns, to melanistic (i.e. black) depending on locality. They are sometimes blotched and sometimes solid-colored. Leiohetereodon geayi is a brown or tan colored snake with dark speckling on it. Leioheterodon madagascariensis is typically green and yellow with a black checkerboard pattern along its back. Leioheterodon modestus is normally a gold-brown color. Some species in the genus Lystrophis {{are referred to as}} tri-color <b>hognose</b> <b>snakes</b> and sometimes as false coral snakes because they display alternating bands of red, white, and black.|$|R
50|$|Some authors elevate H. n. kennerlyi, {{also known}} as the Mexican <b>hognose</b> <b>snake,</b> to species level. Those same authors have subsumed H. n. gloydi into H. nasicus so that there are only 2 species (H. nasicus and H. kennerlyi) and no subspecies.|$|R

25|$|<b>Hognose</b> <b>snakes</b> are {{frequently}} found in herpetoculture. Heterodon nasicus are often {{considered to be}} the easiest to care for, and captive-bred stock is easily found. Heterodon platirhinos is also commonly found, but their dietary requirements can be a challenge for some keepers, and there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that feeding them a diet of exclusively rodents contributes to liver problems and a shortened life span. Leioheterodon species are imported regularly from Madagascar, and are not often bred in captivity and get much larger, so can pose a set of different challenges for care. Lystrophis species are fairly new to the commercial reptile trade, and are now commonly bred in captivity, but can be some of the more expensive <b>hognose</b> <b>snakes</b> available.|$|R
