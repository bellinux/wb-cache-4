25|$|Soon I {{found myself}} on the main bandstand before this {{enormous}} crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E

But then I ended up having to sing {{directly}} into the camera when the sun was right next it, so tears were <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> my face! Videos always have a painful moment. It's either too hot or it's too cold or there's always something. That's part of the fun, I guess" ...|$|E
500|$|The chorus was {{inspired}} by U2's first concert in New York City following the September 11 attacks during their 2001 Elevation Tour. When the lights illuminated the audience during a performance of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name," [...] the band saw tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> the faces of many fans. Upon seeing this raw release of emotion, Bono shouted, [...] "Oh you look so beautiful tonight"; later, the band integrated the line into the chorus. The fans' passion, along with the resolve of the city following the attack, were the primary inspirations {{for many of the}} song's other lyrics.|$|E

500|$|From the 1920s {{through the}} 1950s, {{the story was}} told, re-told and likely embellished in columns by Grantland Rice, Art Carlson, Frank Blair and Dave Lewismore than one of them writing that they had seen the game in person. [...] In Carlson's 1925 account, [...] "the giant center had been {{rendered}} practically useless from the Penn attack", but refused to leave the game. [...] Carlson recalled Schulz's removal from the game this way: [...] "It was a scene I shall never forgetthe giant Schulz, towering above {{the rest of the}} combatants, literally dragged off the field, tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> his mud-spattered cheeks as he frantically protested his removal from the game".|$|E
500|$|The International Dyslexia Association {{screened}} Taare Zameen Par [...] on 29 October 2008 in Seattle, Washington. Khan {{noted in}} his official blog that there were about 200people in the audience {{and that he was}} [...] "curious to see the response of a non-Indian audience to what we had made." [...] He felt some concern that Taare Zameen Par was shown in a conference room rather than a cinema hall and was projected as a DVD rather than as a film. He said that the showing concluded to an [...] "absolutely thunderous standing ovation" [...] which [...] "overwhelmed" [...] him and that he [...] "saw the tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> the cheeks of the audience." [...] Khan also noted that the reaction to the film [...] "was exactly as it had been with audiences back home in India".|$|E
500|$|At dawn on 23 September, {{aircraft}} [...] "observed {{a column}} of fairly orderly traffic of all arms <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> the road from Es Salt to Amman," [...] which was subsequently bombed and machine gunned. Groups of retreating Ottoman soldiers were seen moving from the hills to the south-west towards Amman. Bombing formations attacked these columns with 48 bombs and 7,000 machine gun rounds shortly after 07:00. Eight direct hits on lorries and wagons blocked the road, and the retreat became a disorderly rout. At about the same time, airmen reported that camps at Samakh and Deraa were burning and long trains [...] "with steam up [...] facing east" [...] and north, but [...] "would never arrive anywhere" [...] because the railway lines were cut. Retreating German and Ottoman forces from Nablus were seen approaching Deraa. [...] "And this was the refuge towards which the Fourth Army from Amman was making in headlong retreat!" ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{before the}} third {{leg of the}} Elevation Tour, the September 11 attacks {{occurred}} in New York City and Washington D.C. During the band's first show in New York City following the attacks, the band performed [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", and when the stage lights illuminated the audience, the band saw tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> the faces of many fans. The experience was one inspiration for the song [...] "City of Blinding Lights". The band paid tribute to the 9/11 victims during their performance of the song at the Super Bowl XXXVI halftime show on 3 February 2002. The performance featured {{the names of the}} September 11 victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band, and concluded with Bono opening up his jacket to reveal the Star Spangled Banner. U2's appearance was later ranked number 1 on Sports Illustrateds list of [...] "Top 10 Super Bowl Halftime Shows".|$|E
500|$|The video {{features}} Aguilera with [...] "strawberry-blonde" [...] hair. It {{begins with}} a close-up of a gun barrel. Then, she slowly walks through a [...] "deserted" [...] bedroom and lies down in the room, which is filled with charcoal, while crying. She is seen with mascara <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> her cheeks. As the scene moves on, Aguilera is fighting against a shirtless man, who is considered her lover. The clip ends as Aguilera takes off her shirt in an [...] "Inception-like dreamworld". Critical response to [...] "You Lost Me" [...] video was positive: Latina writer Mariela Rosario and UK magazine OK! noted that the clip was a comeback by Aguilera following the video for Bionic lead single [...] "Not Myself Tonight". Monica Hererra from Billboard also thought that it represents [...] "a kind of return to form for Aguilera". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Brad Wete thought that the video for [...] "You Lost Me" [...] "has some quality material". Similarly, MTV Buzzworthy's Chris Ryan complimented {{it as one of}} Aguilera's best videos ever.|$|E
500|$|John Pomfret of The Washington Post said a wide {{spectrum}} of Chinese and foreigners believed that Liu's award [...] "could actually resonate more deeply within China than any similar act in years". The open letter by Xu Youyu et al, which described Liu as [...] "a splendid choice" [...] because of his advancement of human rights causes and the peaceful fight against social injustice, amassed signatures from about 200 mainland intellectuals and activists; it was posted in Chinese, English, French and Japanese on websites hosted outside China. Artist and critic Ai Weiwei said that, although the regime ought to feel the most ashamed, [...] "intellectuals who had drifted away from their public responsibilities" [...] should bear some of that burden for betraying values they once strove for. Ai said that the Prize was a message from the international community to the Chinese government to respect universal human values, notwithstanding China's economic performance. Writer Liao Yiwu, a close friend of Liu, described it as [...] "a big moment in Chinese history". Another writer, Yu Jie, said he spent the night awake with tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> his face – [...] "Twenty years ago Liu Xiaobo said that China needed someone with moral clarity about what China needs. Now he has become just that person, that he himself was looking for", he said. Former Chinese diplomat Yang Hengjun described it as a strong signal to the Chinese government to speed up political reform [...] "or you will have a lot of enemies around you and within you." ...|$|E

500|$|During Hayden's {{expedition}} of 1877, Yount {{engaged in}} mountaineering with Ingersoll and the cartographer A. D. Wilson in the Wind River Range. They {{were the first}} to ascend the south slopes of Wind River Peak, and, with Wilson, Yount was the first to ascend West Atlantic Peak. Hayden's expedition of 1878 conducted surveys in Yellowstone National Park and surrounding areas in 1878. That expedition included the British mountaineer James Eccles and Eccles's favorite Swiss mountain guide, Michel Payot of Chamonix. Eccles wanted to attempt an ascent of the Grand Teton, then unclimbed. [...] This was the third attempt to climb the Grand Teton by members of Hayden's expeditions. Yount served as the guide in a four-man party that included Eccles, Payot and Wilson. Eccles and Payot were held up by the disappearance of two mules carrying their gear, and so were unable to accompany Wilson and Yount on to the higher parts of the mountain. During the climb, Yount slipped on the ice and fell close to a deep chasm in the glacier, where water was <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> from the cliff above. [...] The hold of his buckskin pants on the ice reportedly prevented him from being carried down into the crevice. Wilson was quoted as saying that Yount was clinging to the rock like [...] "a starfish hanging to a breakwater," [...] and that he himself lowered a rope to assist Yount. Because of the delay and the absence of the experienced Alpine climbers, Yount and Wilson had to turn back a few hundred feet short of the summit, at a spur called The Enclosure. No previous party had come so close to reaching the summit. The undisputed first ascent of the Grand Teton took place 20 years later, in 1898.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} pilot {{script was}} darker in tone {{than the one}} filmed. Thomas intended to take the script to FX, HBO or Showtime, but gave UPN [...] "credit" [...] as they only wanted it a bit lighter to match their standards and practices. There was also a lengthy debate as to whether Veronica could be a rape victim; UPN eventually consented. In the aired version of the episode, Lilly Kane was found by the pool {{in the same spot}} where she was murdered. However, Thomas stated that Lilly's body was originally going {{to be found in the}} ocean, and he had a plan for events which led to Lilly's body being dumped. When Thomas pitched the idea to UPN, the network felt that it was [...] "too dark and creepy" [...] for Jake Kane to dispose of his daughter's body to protect his son, and the idea was changed. Much of the series' scenes were filmed at Stu Segall Productions in San Diego. During the filming of the pilot, producer Paul Kurta said that much of the filming would take place in Oceanside, California. Kurta liked that it was [...] "a seaside town that still feels like middle-class people live there ... Most of the seaside towns feel resort driven." [...] The setting of Neptune High, which was featured in the first two seasons, was also located in Oceanside. The school, Oceanside High School, was paid $7,750 by Stu Segall Productions for the use of the campus and extras. When Thomas watched the final cut of the scene in which Veronica realizes that she has been raped, Thomas thought that he had cast the role correctly. [...] "I’m watching her from the monitor, and tears start <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> her face, and I’m just like, 'Holy shit! We have a star!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the film, Jolson {{rose from}} his seat and ran down to the stage. [...] "God, I think you're really on the level about it. I feel good" [...] he cried to the audience. Stanley Watkins would always {{remember}} Jolson signing autographs after the show, tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> his face. May McAvoy, Jolson's costar remembered that [...] " [...] police were there to control the crowds. It was a very big thing, like The Birth of a Nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hopper's Summer Evening, a {{young couple}} talking in the harsh light of a cottage porch, is inescapably romantic, but Hopper was hurt by one critic's {{suggestion}} that it would do for an illustration in [...] "any woman's magazine." [...] Hopper had the painting {{in the back of}} his head [...] "for 20 years and I never thought of putting the figures in until I actually started last summer. Why any art director would tear the picture apart. The figures were not what interested me; it was the light <b>streaming</b> <b>down,</b> and the night all around." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{was often}} {{considered}} a difficult person, some acquaintances of Capp have stressed that the cartoonist also had a sensitive side; in 1973, when learning that the son of his political rival Ted Kennedy had had his right leg amputated, Capp wrote the boy a letter of encouragement, giving candid advice {{as to how to}} deal with the loss of a limb, which he himself had experienced as a boy. One of Capp's grandchildren recalls that at one point, tears were <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> the cartoonist's cheeks while he was watching a documentary about the Jonestown massacre. Capp is also reported to have given money anonymously to charities and [...] "people in need" [...] at various points in his life.|$|E

2500|$|Film critic Brian Gibson wrote, [...] "So far, {{this seems}} a post-Occupation France happy {{to forget the}} blood and death of Hitler's war a decade earlier. But soon people’s occasional, playful efforts to grab the floating, {{carefree}} balloon become grasping and destructive. In a gorgeous sequence, light <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> alleys as children's shoes clack and clatter on the cobblestones, the balloon bouncing between the walls, Pascal is hunted down for his floating pet. Its ballooning sense of hope and freedom is deflated by a fierce, squabbling mass. Then, fortunately, it floats off, with the breeze of magic-realism, into a feeling of escape and peace, The Red Balloon taking hold of Pascal, lifting him out of this rigid, petty, earthbound life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Michigan Stadium crowd, sensing a major upset, began {{screaming}} and chanting. Michigan {{tried to run}} down the clock, but Ohio State stalled with timeouts and got the ball back after a Wolverine punt. With 29 seconds left, Maciejowski fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by Cecil Pryor. The Buckeyes had committed an unheard-of seven turnovers on the day, six interceptions and a fumble. Moorhead took a knee as the crowd counted down the final seconds, then rushed the field in ecstasy. ABC-TV play-by-play announcer Bill Flemming exclaimed, [...] "There it is! What {{has to be the}} upset of the century!" [...] Schembechler was carried off on players' shoulders (he was accidentally dropped, but Bo noted [...] "it was the only thing [...] fumbled all day."), and Jim Mandich was seen being carried, with tears of joy <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> his cheeks.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to music}} historians Bruce Crowther and Mike Pinfold: [...] "During his {{time he was}} the best known and most popular {{all-around}} entertainer America (and probably the world) has ever known, captivating audiences in the theatre and becoming an attraction on records, radio, and in films. He opened the ears of white audiences to the existence of musical forms alien to their previous understanding and experience … and helped prepare the way for others who would bring a more realistic and sympathetic touch to black musical traditions." [...] Black songwriter Noble Sissle, in the 1930s, said [...] "e was always the champion of the Negro songwriter and performer, and was first to put Negroes in his shows". Of Jolson's [...] "Mammy" [...] songs, he adds, [...] "with real tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> his blackened face, he immortalized the Negro motherhood of America as no individual could." ...|$|E
