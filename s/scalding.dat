5|$|On {{the morning}} of February 6, Foote's seven Union gunboats arrived at Fort Henry and {{established}} their position around 12:30p.m. They soon opened fire at 1,700 yards, beginning an exchange of gunfire with Fort Henry that continued for over an hour. After Tilghman rejected an initial call to surrender, the fleet continued to bombard the fort. This was its first engagement using newly designed and hastily constructed ironclads. Foote deployed the four ironclad gunboats in a line abreast, followed by the three timberclads, {{under the command of}} Seth Ledyard Phelps, which were held back for long-range, but less effective fire against the fort. The high water level of the river and the low elevation of Fort Henry's guns allowed Foote's fleet to escape serious destruction. The Confederate fire was able to hit the ironclads only where their armor was strongest. During the bombardment, all four of the Union ironclads were repeatedly hit by Confederate fire. The USS Essex was seriously damaged when a 32-pound shot from Fort Henry penetrated the ironclad, hitting the middle boiler and sending <b>scalding</b> steam through half the ship. Thirty-two crewmen were killed or wounded, including commander William D. Porter. The ship was out of action {{for the remainder of the}} campaign.|$|E

40|$|<b>Scald</b> {{injury is}} common, {{accounting}} {{for half of}} all burns in pre-school children.

However, the potential for routinely collected medical data to be used to identify high risk children has not been well explored. We used a matched case–control study to identify risk factors for first <b>scald</b> injury in children under 5 using a large, nationally representative database of routinely collected primary care records. Among 986 cases and 9240 controls, male gender, age (2 years), higher birth order, single-parent families and increasing index of material deprivation were associated with increased odds of <b>scald</b> injury.

40|$|Background Most {{intentional}} burns are <b>scalds,</b> and distinguishing these from unintentional causes is challenging. Aim To {{conduct a}} systematic review to identify distinguishing features of intentional and unintentional <b>scalds.</b> Methods We performed an all language literature search of 12 databases 1950 – 2006. Studies were reviewed by two paediatric/burns specialists, using standardised methodology. Included: Primary studies of validated intentional or accidental <b>scalds</b> in children 0 – 18 years and ranked by confirmation of intentional or unintentional origin. Excluded: neglectful scalds; management or complications; studies of mixed burn type or mixed adult and child data. Results 258 studies were reviewed, and 26 included. Five comparative studies ranked highly for confirmation of intentional/unintentional cause of injury. The distinguishing characteristics were defined based on best evidence. Intentional <b>scalds</b> were commonly immersion injuries, caused by hot tap water, affecting the extremities, buttocks or perineum or both. The <b>scalds</b> were symmetrical with clear upper margins, and associated with old fractures and unrelated injuries.

MethodsAn overview of systematic reviews (SR) and a SR of primary studies were performed evaluating interventions to prevent <b>scalds</b> in children. A comprehensive literature search was conducted covering various resources up to October 2012. Experimental and controlled observational studies reporting <b>scald</b> injuries, safety practices and safety equipment use were included. ResultsFourteen systematic reviews and 39 primary studies were included. There is little evidence that interventions are effective in reducing the incidence of <b>scalds</b> in children. More evidence was found that inventions are effective in promoting safe hot tap water temperature, especially when home safety education, home safety checks and discounted or free safety equipment including thermometers and thermostatic mixing valves were provided. No consistent evidence was found for the effectiveness of interventions on the safe handling of hot food or drinks nor improving kitchen safety practices. ConclusionEducation, home safety checks along with thermometers or thermostatic mixing valves should be promoted to reduce tap water <b>scalds.</b> Further research is needed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} interventions on <b>scald</b> injuries and to disentangle the effects of multifaceted interventions on <b>scald</b> injuries and safety practices...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Scalds</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} common forms of thermal injury in young {{children}} worldwide. Childhood <b>scald</b> injuries, which mostly occur in the home, result in substantial health service use and considerable morbidity and mortality. There is little research on effective interventions to prevent <b>scald</b> injuries in young children. OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between a range of modifiable risk factors for medically attended <b>scalds</b> in children under the age of 5  years. DESIGN: A multicentre case-control study in UK hospitals and minor injury units with parallel home observation to validate parental reported exposures. Cases will be 0 - 4  years old with a medically attended <b>scald</b> injury which occurred in their home or garden, matched on gender and age with community controls. An additional control group will comprise unmatched hospital controls drawn from children aged 0 - 4 years attending the same hospitals and minor injury units for other types of injury. Conditional logistic regression will be used for the analysis of cases and matched controls, and unconditional logistic regression for the analysis of cases and unmatched controls to estimate ORs and 95 % CI, adjusted and unadjusted for confounding variables. MAIN EXPOSURE MEASURES: Use of safety equipment and safety practices for <b>scald</b> prevention and <b>scald</b> hazards. DISCUSSION: This large case-control study will investigate modifiable risk factors for <b>scalds</b> injuries, adjust for potential confounders and validate measures of exposure.

40|$|Background: ‘Honeycrisp’ is {{an apple}} {{cultivar}} that {{is susceptible to}} soft <b>scald,</b> a chilling injury expressed as necrotic patches on the peel. Improved understanding of metabolism associated with the disorder would improve our understanding of soft <b>scald</b> and contribute to developing more effective management strategies for apple storage. It was expected that specific gene expression and specific metabolite levels in the peel would be linked with soft <b>scald</b> risk at harvest and/or specific time points during cold storage. Results: Fruit from nine ‘Honeycrisp’ apple orchards that would eventually develop different incidences of soft <b>scald</b> between 4 and 8 weeks of cold air storage were used to contrast and determine differential transcriptomic and metabolomic changes during storage. Untargeted metabolic profiling revealed changes {{in a number of}} distinct pathways preceding and concurrent with soft <b>scald</b> symptom development, including elevated γ-aminobutryic acid (GABA), 1 -hexanol, acylated steryl glycosides, and free p-coumaryl acyl esters. At harvest, levels of sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid acyl esters were relatively higher in peel of fruit that did not later develop the disorder. RNA-seq driven gene expression profiling highlighted possible involvement of genes and associated metabolic processes with soft <b>scald</b> development. These included elevated expression of genes involved in lipid peroxidation and phenolic metabolism in fruit with soft <b>scald,</b> and isoprenoid/brassinosteroid metabolism in fruit that did not develop soft <b>scald.</b> Expression of other stress-related genes in fruit that developed soft <b>scald</b> included chlorophyll catabolism, cell wall loosening, and lipid transport while superoxide dismutases were up-regulated in fruit that did not develop the disorder. Conclusions: This study delineates the sequential transcriptomic and metabolomic changes preceding soft <b>scald</b> symptom development. Changes were differential depending on susceptibility of fruit to the disorder and could be attributed to key stress related and mediating pathways. Keywords:status: publishe...|$|R

Visual wound examination, biopsies and Laser Doppler Imaging were performed at 1, 24 hours and at 3 and 7 days post-burn. A consistent water temperature was maintained within the <b>scald</b> device for long durations (49. 8 ± 0. 1 °C when set at 50 °C). The macroscopic and histologic appearance was consistent between replicates of burn conditions. For 50 °C water, 10 minute duration burns showed significantly deeper tissue injury than all shorter durations at 24 hours post-burn (p ≤ 0. 0001), with damage seen to increase until day 3 post-burn.
