5|$|Comparing folk tales, {{there are}} {{similarities}} between the ala and the Russian Baba Yaga. The aforementioned motif of a stepdaughter coming to an ala’s house in a forest is recorded among Russians too– there a stepdaughter comes to Baba Yaga’s house and feeds her “livestock”. Similar are also the motifs of an ala (by Serbs) and Baba Yaga (by Russians) becoming godmothers to children whom they later eat because the children discover their secret. In the Serbian example, the mother of an ala’s godchild <b>speaks</b> <b>with</b> the ala, and in the Russian, the godchild <b>speaks</b> <b>with</b> Baba Yaga.|$|E

5000|$|Eichelbaum {{interpreted}} his {{terms of}} reference such {{that he did not}} interview anyone who had been directly involved with the case. He did not <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> any of the children. He did not <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> the children's parents, some of whom regularly visited the Civic Crèche [...] He did not <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> the children's evidential interviewers. He did not <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> any of the crèche workers. He did not <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> Ellis's mother. He did not <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> Peter Ellis. He did not <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> the oldest complainant, one of seven children upon whose evidence Ellis was convicted. Several months after the trial had ended, the child stated that she had not been sexually abused. Eichelbaum did not seek advice from academics within New Zealand universities when appointing experts for his inquiry. The only people with whom Eichelbaum discussed the matter of the selection of the experts were Justice Ministry officials and Thomas Lyon, a USA law professor. In 1999 Lyon criticised the direction and relevance of research undertaken by experts nominated by Ellis's counsel. Lyon's critique was cited approvingly in the Crown's submission to the ministerial inquiry.|$|R

5|$|As a {{character}} in the games, Mewtwo's physical appearance is not its only stark divergence from Mew. While the alterations to the genetic source material it was cloned resulted in its abilities surpassing Mew's, it also resulted in Mewtwo developing a vicious personality that is primarily interested in proving its own strength. The franchise's non-video game media, particularly the anime, has expanded upon the character. In the most notable instance, Mewtwo telepathically <b>speaks</b> <b>with</b> a male voice and is existentially torn over its purpose in the world.|$|E

After his mind is hijacked in the pilot episode, Black <b>speaks</b> <b>with</b> the same voice that the Mysterons are heard to use when transmitting threats to Earth.

Optimus accepts the burden and the core relinquishes the Autobot Matrix of Leadership.|$|E
