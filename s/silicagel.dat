Since polyphosphates has been used broadly for the manufacturing of fertilizers, foods, detergents, dentifrices, industrial water treatments etc. as ingredient of them, the measurments on the variation of dispersibility for the <b>silicagel</b> and starch suspension with some phosphats are important for studying the behavior of system containing such substance. The outline of results may be summarized in the following: (1). Effects of 3 sorts of polyphosphates such as sodium pyrophosphate, sodium tripolyphospnate, and sodium polyphospate (cr generaIly sodium hexameta phosphate) on the about 5. 0 % aqueous suspension of <b>silicagel</b> and starch are studied and the considerable increase of the former disrersion are observed, but the latter are only apprcciable. (2). For <b>silicagel</b> suspcnsion, each curve relating the ratios of Dispersion-quantities added shows that the increasing effect with these polyphosphates resembles each other, and in paticular sodium pyrophophate shows considerable effect. (3). Comparing these dispersibility experimets of <b>silicagel</b> with those of starch, it appars that the result obtain for <b>silicagel</b> is presumably ascribed to the dispersing effect coming from the adsorption of polyphosphates and the starch may be formed ester compound caused by the chemical reaction of these polyphosphate ions with the hydroxyl group in that. 浅岡等が従来行っている重合燐酸塩の利用に関連した多くの研究のうちで既発表のものは若干に過ぎない。本報告では工業用水処理としての珪酸塩の分散性の研究，食品化学関係での澱粉の分散性の研究とをかねた研究の一環として，種々の燐酸塩を添加し，その添加効果を調べるために行ったものである...|$|E

Two types of surfaces are examined : those of amorphous solids oriented at random (<b>silicagels)</b> and those of layer lattice silicates (turbostratic smectites) preferentially oriented about one crystal axis, namely the C axis perpendicular to the layers. In the first case, pulse NMR permits to define the various kinds of motions experienced by the adsorbed species.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2014 Sesötesi cihazlar ülkemizde teşhis amaçlı olarak yaygın bir şekilde kullanılmaktadır. Sesötesi teşhis cihazlarının pozisyon doğrulama (kalibrasyon), mevcut sistemlerin sinyal ve gürültü oranlarının iyileştirilmesinde, kullanıcıların cihaz kullanımları öncesi pratik çalışmalarında ve uygulama esnasında alınan görüntülerin bilinirliği ve yorumlama kolaylığı sağlanması amacıyla fantomlara ihtiyaç duyulmaktadır. Sesötesi uygulamalarında insan dokularının özel karakteristiğini tasvir edebilecek test materyallerine fantom veya doku simülatörü denir. Literatürde çeşitli dokuların tasvir edilmesi amacıyla değişik materyaller kullanılarak fantomlar oluşturulmuştur. Özellikle yumuşak dokuların tasvir edilmesi amacıyla agar, jelatin, magnezyumsilikat, yağ jel, poliüretan, epoksi reçine, polivinil alkol (PVA), polisakkarit jelleri gibi materyaller ile oda sıcaklığında sertleşebilen silikonlar (RTV) kullanılanlardandır. Su temelli materyaller özellikle agar ve jelatin gibi hidrojel olarak adlandırılabilecek malzemeler iyi performans, herhangi bir zararlı kimyasal içermemeleri, kolay kullanım, uygulamada sağladıkları esneklik ve akustik özellikleriyle öne çıkabilmektedirler. Fantomların üretilmesinde en önemli kriterler simule edilmek istenilen dokuların akustik özelliklerine sahip olunmasının sağlanabilmesidir. Bunların başında dokudaki ses hızı, akustik empedansı, zayıflatma ve gerisaçılım katsayıları ile dokunun basınç altındaki değişime tepkisidir. Ticari olarak üretilen fantomlar birçok pazar ve belli başlı uygulamalar için üretilmiş olup kişiselleştirilememektedir. Birçok dokuyu ve organı temsili olarak oluşturan bu fantomların fiyatları yüksek değerlere ulaşabilmektedir. Bu sebeple uygulama yapılacak dokulara en yakın özellikte, kullanımı kolay ve maliyeti düşük fantomların üretilmesi önem taşımaktadır. Jelatin gibi materyaller ile oluşturulmuş fantom veya doku modellerinde yaşanan en temel sorunlar; mikrobiyolojik unsurların (bakteri ve mantarların) zaman içinde gelişmesi ve hassas yapıları nedeniyle fantomların fiziksel ve akustik özelliklerini kaybedebilmeleridir. Çalışmada yapımı kolay, herhangi bir zararlı kimyasal içermeyen hayvansal bir ürün olan jelatin kullanarak, maliyeti düşük sesötesi fantomlar oluşturarak ölçümler alındı. Ölçümlerin alınmasında darbe-yankı metodu ve A tipi tarama kullanılarak, fantomların içerisine yerleştirdiğimiz kitle ve kist tasvirlerinin konum, boyut gibi özelliklerinin tespit edilmesine çalışıldı. Fantomdaki ses hızının ölçümü ve bu hızın insan yumuşak dokularındaki hız değerine (&# 8776; 1540 m/s) ulaştırılması için çalışma yapıldı. Ayrıca; doku içerisinde bulunması muhtemel saçıcı ve dağıtıcı tasvirlerini de katmak suretiyle ölçümlerimizin gerçekliği arttırılmaya çalışıldı. Medical imaging {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} {{developing}} areas in medicine. One of the major factors of this development is examining the tissues without physical intervention. The most frequently used technique in medical imaging is the use of ultrasonic systems due to its damage-free nature to tissues, easy to use, getting real time images, and non-radiation technique, which is relatively low cost comparing with other imaging methods. Ultrasound systems use sound waves to examine tissues. When sound waves meet different impedance inside the human body, they are scattered or backscattered where the same transducer collects the backscattered waves. When one transducer makes this process, is called A type scan. In practice instead of a single transducer an array of transducers are used whose outputs can be combined to produce two-dimensional images, which are called B scan. The B scan works as A type scan mode but plots the strength of the scattered or backscattered signals as changes in brightness. Strong reflections are brighter than the weaker reflections. While transducer is moving on human body, a two-dimensional image is built by these reflections. Today, mostly ultrasonic system imaging uses B type scan. Ultrasound phantom or tissue simulators are testing objects that illustrate or simulate the special characteristics of human tissues in ultrasonic applications. Hospitals, clinics and research centers use phantoms to calibrate and initial testing of their systems, additionally training of ultrasound technicians prior to the practical work. Optimizing signal to noise ratios of the existing systems and getting familiar before real applications are also necessary. In literature, various materials and many techniques have been proposed to produce phantoms. Specifically, for mimicking soft tissues agars, gelatin, magnesium silicate, oil gel, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyester and epoxy resins, and room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone are frequently used. Water based substitutes, agars and gelatin based soft tissue substitutes (also called hydrogels) are the most widely used materials that have advantages of being easy to prepare, and easy to use. Moreover, well performance, containing no harmful chemicals, flexibility and acoustic properties come into prominence at usage. The ideal ultrasound phantom should have same acoustical properties as those simulated tissues. The most important characteristics are sound speed in tissue, acoustical impedance, attenuation, backscatter coefficient and nonlinearity parameter. The speed of sound in tissue typically determined by the time of flight measurements through a material of given thickness. Acoustic impedance can be calculated by speed of sound in tissue and measured density of material. The attenuation coefficient can be measured using through-transmission method, especially for low attenuation materials. Acoustic properties of soft tissue phantoms are highly dependent on preparation technique and handling. Mostly measurements of acoustic properties of tissues are taken in room temperature, however these will be highly dependent on tissue substitutes and temperature varies. The most important problem encountered in the use of such materials in phantoms is microbiological factors (i. e., bacteria and fungus) which may evolve over time due to the sensitivity nature of losing physical specifications and acoustical characteristics that change with time. Many commercially produced phantoms, which are used by a wide range of markets, are not customized but manufactured for particular applications. Customize designed phantoms are either expensive or cannot simply developed by the user. To overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages and to have the closest features to the tissues one may need to produce his/her own easily produced and low cost phantom. In this thesis; gelatin, which is an animal product that contains no harmful chemicals, has been used as low-cost, homemade ultrasonic phantoms. The pulse-echo measurements of A type scanning is preferred. Note that the pulse-echo method is the most frequently used and simply method. This method relies on sending sound waves from a transducer and getting echoes from the same one. Among various available 1 MHz surface type transducers in our laboratory, a transducer with the best frequency response has been chosen for experiments whose center frequency was at 870 kHz with a bandwidth of 485 kHz. Vegetable oil and vaseline are used as couplant. As these couplant materials cause defect during the tests, simply water is used also. For those, the selection criteria should be the same as the impedance value with applied tissues additional non-reacting chemical selection. In this study, the cartridge of silicon has been considered as the tissue mimicking phantom material, which can be easily found in the market. 200 bloom of beef gelatin is used in this study, which is low cost, contains no harmful chemical and can easily be found in vendors. To simulate a mass and a cyst in a tissue, an olive and a grape have been chosen respectively. Both of are considered in literature also. Moreover, water filled balloons may be used for depiction of cyst and fruit or vegetable pieces may be used for depiction of soft tissue mass also. The probable scatters within tissue are simulated (to strengthen the reliability of the measurements) by local dehumidifier <b>silicagels.</b> Existing laboratory tools such as an ultrasound pulse sender/receiver, a surface type transducer, an oscilloscope and by labview program controlled computer have been used as the experimental setup. Ultrasonic velocity measurements and position determination of foreign objects (such as money) are studied for our homemade produced phantom. Then, in another homemade produced phantom cyst depiction is formed and its location is determined. Similarly, mass simulated measurements have been performed. In order to achieve the same range of ultrasonic velocity (approx. 1540 m/s) in human soft tissues ethanol (70 %) is added to the phantom. Ethanol addition to measurements shows an effect of rate increase. Another ethanol added gelatin mixture has been prepared for re-measurements to simulate scatters in the tissues by using <b>silicagels,</b> which are distributed as possible as homogenously whose radial dimensions are 2 - 4 mm. In fact, it is rather difficult to create a desired distribution of <b>silicagels</b> in the gelatin and ethanol liquid mixture homogenously. The <b>silicagels</b> that are added to create the noise in the phantom but did not. <b>Silicagel’s</b> radial dimensions are much bigger than sound wavelength, since backscattered waves amplitude are decreased; instead of <b>silicagels,</b> more highly reflective materials should be used is concluded. In this thesis, measurement of depth has achieved correctly for depicted materials in soft tissue phantoms, which are made by gelatin. Additionally, adding ethanol to gelatin mixture has increased the sound speed in the phantom to as approximate as real soft tissue values. Further study may be necessary to investigate the effect of increasing the concentration of ethanol mixture to phantoms to see the effect of sound speed. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

40|$|Une réponse {{possible}} au problème de la déstabilisation par démixtion des mélanges supercarburant-alcools est l'abaissement de leur {{teneur en eau}} par adsorption physique. La forte affinité pour l'eau des résines échangeuses d'ions de type polystyrène sulfonate permet d'envisager leur utilisation dans ce cas spécifique d'application. Le principal intérêt de ce nouveau matériau adsorbant est de pouvoir se régénérer avec des calories de bas niveau (100 - 120 °C). Nous avons donc étudié, du point de vue capacité d'adsorption et cinétique d'adsorption, le comportement de cet adsorbant et comparé ses performances à celles d'adsorbants plus classiques tels que le <b>silicagel,</b> l'alumine et le tamis moléculaire 3 Å. Les formes ioniques de la résine mises en oeuvre sont les formes : K+, Na+ et Mg 2 +. Sur le plan de la capacité totale d'adsorption, la résine, quelle que soit sa forme ionique, présente des performances supérieures à celles de l'alumine et du <b>silicagel.</b> Seule la forme Mg 2 + adsorbe autant d'eau que le tamis moléculaire. L'efficacité de la résine est sensible à {{la nature}} de l'alcool du mélange considéré et augmente selon la séquence méthanol A possible answer {{to the problem of}} destabilization by the segregation of premium-fuel/alcohol blends lies in decreasing their water content by physical adsorption. The strong affinity of water for ion-exchange resins of the polystyrene sulfonate type suggests their use for this specific application. The main advantage of this newadsorbent material is that it can be regenerated with low-level heat (100 - 120 °C). We thus investigated the behavior of this adsorbent from the standpoint of its adsorption capacity and adsorption kinetics. Its performances were compared to those of more conventional adsorbents, such as <b>silicagel,</b> alumina and a 3 Å molecular sieve. The ionic forms of the resin used are in the form of K+, Na+ and Mg 2 +. From the standpoint of total adsorption capacity, resin, whatever its ionic form may be, has better performances then alumina and <b>silicagel.</b> Only the Mg 2 + form adsorbs as much water as a molecular sieve. The effectiveness of resin is sensitive {{to the nature of the}} alcohol in the blend considered and increases via the methanol < ethanol < tert-butanol sequence. From the kinetic standpoint, resin in the K+ form is the one that gives the best results. Its adsorption rate is nearly ten times higher than that of a molecular sieve. Then come resin in the Na+ form, alumina, resin in the Mg 2 + form and the molecular sieve. Resin in the K+ form, which achieves the best compromise between adsorption capacity and rate, thus proves to be an effective adsorbent of water present in premium-fuel/alcohol blends. This ability is confirmed when it is implemented in a fixed bed, where it is much more effective than a molecular sieve. However, its effectiveness is limited to blends containing less than 10 % volume of oxygenated compounds...|$|E

It meets all requirements to be set by Regulation (EC) No 333 / 2007, respective by new Regulation (EC) No 836 / 2011. After the method validation, the content of 4 PAH was investigated in twelve samples of various smoked sausages manufactured in Slovakia. Two analyzed products showed high PAH levels exceeding maximum legislation limits set for B[a]P as well as for sum of 4 PAH by Regulation (EC) No 835 / 2011...|$|E

For this purpose the films were processed on vertical form, fill and seal machines. The pouches were filled with <b>silicagel</b> and some were further stressed on a vibration table. The influence of mechanical stresses was examined by a phinole test and also by determination of the water vapour transmission rate. These values were compared with the water vapour transmission rate of the films before processing. The {{results of the study}} show a considerable barrier loss for the metallized films, while the aluminium/plastic laminates were much more stable against the mechanical stresses...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{response}} of a granular material during a stop-and-go shear experiment is investigated using an annular shear cell and <b>silicagel</b> powders of different particle sizes. The experimental results are examined {{on the basis}} of the Dieterich-Rice-Ruina model for solid friction. In addition to making this analogy with solid friction. we describe a new instability that is observed when restarting shear, where the powder bed is found to slip and compact for short hold times but only dilates for long hold times. The minimum bold time to restore a non-slip behaviour has been investigated for different size particles and normal loadings. The observed dependencies show analogies between this behaviour and the sliding rearrangements seen above the stick-slip threshold...|$|E
