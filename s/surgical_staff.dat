25|$|Personalized {{tourniquet}} instruments have digital {{displays and}} easy-to-use user interfaces. Typically, the tourniquet instrument allows the perioperative staff {{to set the}} tourniquet pressure, inflate or deflate the tourniquet cuff, and adjust safety settings such as the maximum allowed pressure and time limits. The digital display and control buttons give the <b>surgical</b> <b>staff</b> a straightforward method of monitoring the tourniquet pressure and time, and for changing the various tourniquet settings. Personalized tourniquet instruments have non-volatile memory to enable <b>surgical</b> <b>staff</b> to store specialized settings most appropriate for certain surgeries (e.g. paediatric and hand surgery), relevant data about significant surgical events related to tourniquet usage, and to enable a data printout or transfer to an operating room information network. In addition, personalized tourniquet instruments use intuitive audio-visual alarms to alert the <b>surgical</b> <b>staff</b> of events related to patient safety.|$|E

In his thirty years at the hospital he started the Harlem Hospital Bulletin, headed the team that first used chlortetracycline on humans, founded the hospital's cancer research center, and earned a reputation as an expert on head injuries. He was a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons and the American Medical Association.|$|E
25|$|In 1859, Whitehead {{enrolled}} at the Manchester Royal School of Medicine, {{also known as the}} Chatham Street Medical School. He did so without telling his parents and by borrowing money from a cousin for the purpose. Concurrent with the early years of his training, and as was usual at the time, he was apprenticed for 18months to the general practice of Drs. Harris and Bennett in Bury. These two men also acted as medical officers appointed by the Board of Guardians of the Bury Poor Law Union; Bennett alone was attending an average of 860 cases per annum for the Union around this time and Whitehead was thus exposed to work specifically relating to the conditions of the poor as well as general dispensing. The experience gained during this initial period subsequently enabled him to act as a locum tenens at the Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI), where he mingled with qualified physicians and <b>surgical</b> <b>staff,</b> watched operations and witnessed the administrative workings of a hospital. So much of his time was spent at the hospital that it became his primary residence; he also spent six months working in the infirmary at Withington workhouse.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To analyse the {{relation}} between symptoms regularly reported by hospital personnel and exposure to anaesthetics. SETTING [...] Personnel of 18 hospitals in Paris from 1987 to 1989. DESIGN [...] An exposed group that included all operating theatre members except for doctors, and which was divided into three subgroups depending {{on the degree of}} exposure [...] exposure was measured by the frequency of the use of the scavenging system [...] and a control group that included other hospital personnel matched by hospital, sex, occupation, age, and duration of service. SUBJECTS [...] 557 exposed workers and 566 unexposed workers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The groups were compared according to the crude rates of regular symptoms. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated to estimate the risks associated with exposure to anaesthetic gas. Liver transaminase activities (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase (s-ASAT, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) were measured and compared between groups of exposure. RESULTS [...] After controlling for working conditions and matching factors, neuropsychological symptoms and tiredness were reported more by workers in less often scavenged theatres than by controls. No difference was found between workers of the well scavenged theatres and controls. Among the exposed workers, the members of paediatric <b>surgical</b> <b>staffs</b> reported a higher rate of neurological complaints (tingling, numbness, cramps) and tiredness than the members of the other <b>surgical</b> <b>staffs.</b> They had a high value of s-ASAT more frequently than the other exposed workers. CONCLUSION [...] These results strengthen the hypothesis of a causal relation between exposure to anaesthetics and neuropsychological symptoms, and show a dose-response effect. They suggest that the use of ventilating systems in operating rooms is an effective means of prevention...|$|R
30|$|Because his serum {{creatine}} kinase value was elevated at {{the cessation of}} heparin, anticoagulation by unfractionated heparin could not have prevented platelet thrombosis. Therefore, we should performed the tracheostomy to secure the patient’s airway under DAPT or only aspirin therapy {{a month after the}} DES implantation, and performed the laryngectomy and right hemi-thyroidectomy five months after the first surgery. This case is serious warnings of perioperative major adverse cardiac events induced by discontinuation of DAPT; unfractionated heparin was an insufficient safeguard against platelet thrombosis, and perioperative massive bleeding induced by restarting antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy. In addition, a series of human errors, which the cardiologist chosen DES regardless of scheduled total larygectomy, the discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy shortly after a DES placement, and the <b>surgical</b> <b>staffs</b> failed to share the elevated serum CK and CK-MB values, caused life-threatening complications.|$|R
50|$|The robot {{normally}} costs $1,390,000 {{and while}} its disposable supply cost is normally $1,500 per procedure, {{the cost of}} the procedure is higher. Additional surgical training is needed to operate the system. Numerous feasibility studies have been done to determine whether the purchase of such systems are worthwhile. As it stands, opinions differ dramatically. Surgeons report that, although the manufacturers of such systems provide training on this new technology, the learning phase is intensive and surgeons must operate on twelve to eighteen patients before they adapt. During the training phase, minimally invasive operations can take up to twice as long as traditional surgery, leading to operating room tie ups and <b>surgical</b> <b>staffs</b> keeping patients under anesthesia for longer periods. Patient surveys indicate they chose the procedure based on expectations of decreased morbidity, improved outcomes, reduced blood loss and less pain.

30|$|Because {{the patient}} had airway {{stenosis}} with a recent placement of DES, we should have first performed the tracheostomy on the patient with strict hemostasis to secure the airway under continuation of DAPT or only aspirin {{a month after the}} DES implantation.

This case is serious warnings of perioperative MACE induced by discontinuation of DAPT; 400 U/h of unfractionated heparin was an insufficient safeguard against platelet thrombosis, and perioperative massive bleeding then induced by restarting antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy. In addition, a series of human errors, which the cardiologist at local hospital chosen DES regardless of scheduled total larygectomy, the discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy, and the <b>surgical</b> <b>staffs</b> failed to share the elevated serum CK and CK-MB values, caused life-threatening complications.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the volume of work {{generated}} by one consultant (out of a surgical unit of seven) managing all the upper gastrointestinal malignancy in a district general hospital serving a population of 480, 000. A 3 -year period was prospectively audited and the volume of out-patient and in-patient workload assessed with particular reference to resource management and levels of <b>surgical</b> <b>staffing.</b> Oesophagogastric cancer accounted for a mean of 61 new cases per year, representing 5. 3 % of new patient referrals. Assuming that a complex major operation for an oesophagogastric cancer equates to four intermediate equivalent values (IEVs), then this translated to a mean operative workload of 186 IEVs per year, representing 16. 7 % of the total elective operative workload of 1140 IEVs per year. Thus, all the oesophagogastric cancer was managed by a single firm as a speciality in a district general hospital over this 3 -year period, though a relatively small proportion of new patients with oesophagogastric cancer translated into a significantly greater burden on the resources of consultant manpower and operating theatre time...|$|R

30|$|Bridging with anticoagulants, such as low-molecular-weight heparin, after {{interruption}} of DAPT during the perioperative period is advised [2]. In Japan, unfractionated heparin, having no evidence and used empirically, is also advised [4]. But the newer perioperative guideline recommend continue DAPT in patients undergoing urgent noncardiac surgery {{during the first}} 4 to 6  weeks after BMS or DES implantation unless the risk of bleeding outweights the benefit of stent thrombosis prevention [1]. In addition, {{there has not been}} any evidence demonstrating the efficacy of bridging with anticoagulants using heparin. In this case, we performed anticoagulation therapy using unfractionated heparin. Nevertheless, the serum CK-MB value of the patient was elevated at the time of cessation of heparin despite a slightly prolonged aPTT (Table  1). The all <b>surgical</b> <b>staffs</b> failed to share the elevated serum CK and CK-MB values at that point and failed to cancel the surgery, which were the third issue. And a white thrombus in the DES was confirmed at the time of recanalization. Although his preoperative aPTT was not markedly prolonged, anticoagulant therapy of 400 U/h of unfractionated heparin could not have prevented platelet thrombosis in this case.|$|R

30|$|Because {{the patient}} might have mild {{impairment}} in expression of chest pain due to progressive laryngeal cancer and/or feel little pain due to nerve damage by old myocardial infarction, the patient could complained less chest pain {{at the time}} of visiting to local hospital and entering the operation room, which could induced misjudgment. And a series of human errors occurred and caused life-threatening complications. Human errors were as follows: the cardiologist at the local hospital chosen DES instead of BMS or POBA regardless of scheduled total larygectomy; the root cause of this incident, the discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy shortly after the myocardial infarction and DES placement, and the all <b>surgical</b> <b>staffs</b> failed to share the elevated serum CK and CK-MB values and failed to cancel the surgery. After this case, we proposed to create the hospital task force for updating and promoting the perioperative PCI, antiplatelet and anticoagulation procedures.

40|$|Objective: A {{traditional}} clinical pharmacy {{service for}} surgical patients involves a ward visit that identifies and responds to issues after prescribing has taken place. It was hypothesised that pharmacist {{involvement in a}} general surgery predashadmission clinic (PAC) would provide elective patients with significantly better pharmaceutical care than ward visits alone. Method: 100 elective general surgery patients were recruited into 2 groups {{as part of a}} non-randomised controlled trial. The groups were comparable in terms of age, surgical procedure and use of medicines. The control group received standard ward visits. The intervention group had pharmaceutical assessment in a pre-admission clinic. This assessment incorporated pharmacist-led drug history taking and prescription transcription. Outcome measures: Number, classification and clinical significance of pharmaceutical interventions. Results: A pharmacist made 76 interventions in the PAC group and 79 interventions in the ward group. No prescribing errors and omissions were made in the PAC group. The clinical significance of PAC interventions was rated more highly than ward interventions on two scales. Involvement in the PAC increased the pharmacist's workload, but saved time for <b>surgical</b> and nursing <b>staff.</b> <b>Surgical</b> and nursing <b>staff</b> identified writing discharge prescriptions as the most valuable service provided by the PAC pharmacist. Conclusion: By ensuring safe prescribing in the PAC group, the pharmacist was able to become more involved in clinical issues. Pharmacist involvement in PACs presents a useful opportunity for expansion of pharmacy services. However, extra resources would be needed in order to provide these services fully...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} a {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) method was used to develop a validated model of a hospital operating theater. The model was employed to perform simulation to predict the distribution of airflow and movement of the airborne particles inside the operating theater at a steady-state condition. The airborne particles were modeled as discrete particles which were released from the exposed body surface of the <b>surgical</b> <b>staffs</b> {{at a rate of}} 10 CFU/s. The effect of laminar inlet air flow velocity on the airborne particles concentration around the operating table was examined. It was found that the air flows straight downward from the air-conditioning diffuser towards the middle of the operating table. However, the existence of the medical lamp causes a vortex air flow condition below it. Air also penetrates the ultra-clean area {{on the opposite side of}} the operating table. The airborne particles are washed away from the vicinity of the operating table by the air flow. This is more effective when the supply air flow velocity is high. At low air flow velocity, some particles appear to penetrate into the ultra-clean area near the edges of the operating table. At higher air flow velocity, the airborne particles seem to be more effectively washed away from this region. High concentration of airborne particles occurs underneath the medical lamp due to vortices created by the air flow. Higher air flow velocity increases the level of particles concentration in this area...|$|R
