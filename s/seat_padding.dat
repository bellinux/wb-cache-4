25|$|A {{kneeling}} chair adds {{an additional}} body part, the knees, {{to support the}} weight of the body. A sit-stand chair distributes most of {{the weight of the}} occupant to the feet. Many chairs are padded or have cushions. Padding can be on the seat of the chair only, on the seat and back, or also on any arm rests or foot rest the chair may have. Padding will not shift the weight to different parts of the body (unless the chair is so soft that the shape is altered). However, padding does distribute the weight by increasing the area of contact between the chair and the body. A hard wood chair feels hard because the contact point between the occupant and the chair is small. The same body weight over a smaller area means greater pressure on that area. Spreading the area reduces the pressure at any given point. In lieu of padding, flexible materials, such as wicker, may be used instead with similar effects of distributing the weight. Since most of the body weight is supported {{in the back of the}} <b>seat,</b> <b>padding</b> there should be firmer than the front of the seat which only has the weight of the legs to support. Chairs that have padding that is the same density front and back will feel soft in the back area and hard to the underside of the knees.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Introduction. The high {{prevalence}} of {{low back pain}} in drivers of commercial motor vehicles is well-documented. A number of interventions to reduce low back pain in commercial motor vehicle operators have focused on reducing exposures to wholebody vibration (WBV). Objective. An intervention to be evaluated for the trucking industry is an air-filled ballistic <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> designed to reduce exposure to WBV. The effectiveness of the <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> in semi-trucks {{has not yet been}} established. Results from a previous pilot study involving 12 -ton and 16 -ton vibratory rollers used by Seattle Public Utility drivers suggest that the <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> is not effective at very low speeds (1 - 3 mph). Methods. The current study measures, characterizes and compares WBV exposures in nine truck drivers who operated their trucks over the same roads. WBV exposures were compared between their existing air-suspension seat and the air-filled ballistic <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> which sat on top of their existing seat. This study uses a Wilcoxon signed rank test to compare the <b>seat</b> <b>pad’s</b> effectiveness in reducing WBV exposures relative to their existing air-suspension seat. Results. Overall, the truck drivers' vibration exposures were above daily vibration action values set by the International Standards Organization (ISO) and the air-filled ballistic <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> did not significantly reduce WBV exposures relative to the WBV exposures experienced with their existing air-suspension seat. Conclusions. In the semi-trucks evaluated in this study, the air-filled ballistic <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> was not effective in reducing WBV exposures. The <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> {{has been shown to be}} effective in reducing WBV exposures in public transportation buses and cars. The answer for why the air-filled <b>seat</b> <b>pads</b> were not effective in semi-trucks may lie in a future analysis of the power spectral densities, which shows the vibration exposures as a function of frequency. Buses and cars produce more high frequency vibration energy, and the air-filled <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> has been shown to be effective in these vehicles when travelling at moderate to high speeds. Trucks may produce less high frequency vibration energy, and this may have diminished the air-filled <b>seat</b> <b>pad’s</b> effectiveness in the semi-truck evaluated in this study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Travel {{with long}} hours will create {{discomfort}} feeling for passenger especially express bus passenger. Long hour travel will create physiological stress on passenger. It may due to seat space limitation, noise, vibration, seat hardness {{as well as}} seat comfort. Seat comfort is a subjective feeling that related to psychological aspect of passenger. In this project, the bus passenger seat is integrated with air-based and gel-based material. In Malaysia, most of the express coaches are using polyurethane foam based cushion in the <b>seat</b> <b>padding.</b> This type of the <b>seat</b> <b>padding</b> may cause a bus passenger who sit for long journey will feel uncomfortable and fatigue. There are two main causes which lead to seating discomfort which is vibration and pressure distribution on the seat. The new design a bus passenger seat is using air-based cushion to improve the seating comfort. The air-based seat was validated by using MatLab SimuLINK software. In the model validation process, the parameters of air cell height gave effect on the pressure change rate of air cushion model. The comfortable level of the air cushion could be improved by reducing the pressure change rate and cell height...|$|E
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{researchers}} have investigated seat design {{issues for the}} occupants and operators of underground mine transport vehicles relative to whole-body vibration (WBV) and mechanical shock. Considering the ergonomic and engineering improvements made to underground mine shuttle car seats, this study has focused on reducing injury risk by improving seating on transport vehicles such as scoops, mantrips, personnel carriers, and rail-mounted locomotives. Similarly, proposed seat design improvements included layering of various types of viscoelastic foam padding to isolate vehicle occupants and operators from adverse health effects of jarring/jolting exposure. This paper discusses the results obtained from laboratory vibration testing of new <b>seat</b> <b>padding</b> materials in seven configurations at the NIOSH - Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) showing that careful use of configuration and materials can reduce the operator 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s exposure to WBV.

40|$|Polyurethane foam is {{commonly}} used as padding in car seats despite some problems concerning comfort and recycling. Compared with polyurethane foam, textile <b>seat</b> <b>padding</b> is easier to recycle; so textile padding is a good candidate to substitute foam padding as regulations on recycling have become more stringent on car manufacturers. With the available textile option, warp-knitted spacer fabrics are likely a good substitute for polyurethane foam as padding in car seats. Warp-knitted spacer fabric structures can be designed to be quite flexible {{in a variety of}} thicknesses. Warp-knitted spacer fabrics can be very resilient and may display good breathing properties. The current work presents a study on the application of warp-knitted spacer fabrics as cushion in car seats. The results show that, relatively to polyurethane foam, warp-knitted spacer fabrics demonstrate better recovery to compression, thermal properties and breathability. Furthermore, warp-knitted spacer fabrics retain their original thickness for longer time and can be easily recycled. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

This thesis provides an analysis of the scope, incidence and severity of back pain in the Naval Aviation helicopter pilot community. Of the helicopter pilots who responded to the survey, 88. 1 % are experiencing back pain during at least 50 % of their flights and 34. 4 % admit this pain is affecting their situational awareness.

40|$|While most aviators and aircrew {{complain}} that back pain is an occupational hazard, {{the truth is}} that it is an overwhelming problem for aviators, and non-aviators alike. It is the fifth most common reason for a visit to a physician in the United States today. It is the second most common cause of work absenteeism. The direct and indirect costs to the consumer have been estimated as high as $ 50 - 100 billion per year. 1 In aviation, it is a problem across all communities, not limited to any particular platform, but by many accounts worse in the rotary wing community 2. Long hours in the cockpit, ineffective <b>seat</b> <b>padding,</b> poor posture, NVG use, and constant vibration all may contribute to strain and fatigue in the lumbar musculature.
