5|$|Julia {{had started}} {{going out to}} dance halls in 1942, and met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling Julia that {{because there was a}} war on, she <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and enjoy herself. Julia took his advice, and often gave her young son a piece of chocolate or sugar pastry the next morning for breakfast that she had been given the night before. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had been raped by an unknown soldier.|$|E
5|$|During 1942–1943, Julia {{lived with}} her son at The Dairy Cottage, 120aAllerton Road, Woolton. The cottage was owned by Mimi's husband, and Mimi wanted Julia to live there because they would be closer to her house and also out of the Stanley house. As Alf was often away at sea, Julia started going out to dance halls. In 1942, she met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf later blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling her that {{because there was a}} war on, she <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and enjoy herself. After an evening out, she would often give her young son a piece of chocolate or shortcrust pastry the next morning for breakfast. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had been raped by an unknown soldier. Williams refused to live with Julia— who was still married to Alf— until she gave up John, which she refused to do. When Alf eventually came home in 1944, he offered to look after his wife, their son, and the expected baby, but she rejected the idea.|$|E

25|$|Kitchener and Asquith were {{agreed that}} Robertson should become CIGS, but Robertson {{refused to do}} this if Kitchener “continued to be his own CIGS”, {{although}} given Kitchener’s great prestige {{he did not want}} him to resign; he wanted the Secretary of State to be sidelined to an advisory role like the Prussian War Minister. Asquith asked them to negotiate an agreement, which they did over the exchange of several draft documents at the Hotel de Crillon in Paris. Kitchener agreed that Robertson alone should present strategic advice to the Cabinet, with Kitchener responsible for recruiting and supplying the Army, although he refused to agree that military orders <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> over Robertson’s signature alone – it was agreed that the Secretary of State should continue to sign orders jointly with the CIGS. The agreement was formalised in a Royal Order in Council in January 1916. Robertson was suspicious of efforts in the Balkans and Near East, and was instead committed to major British offensives against Germany on the Western Front— the first of these was to be the Somme in 1916.|$|E
500|$|His autobiography, Conn Smythe: If You Can't Beat 'Em in the Alley, {{written with}} Scott Young, was {{published}} posthumously in 1981. The title {{was taken from}} Smythe's credo, [...] "If you can't beat 'em in the alley, you can't beat 'em on the ice." [...] In Smythe's memoir he describes it as the most misunderstood remark he ever made. Rather than meaning that his players <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and bully the opposition, he meant the opposite; that his players should refuse to be bullied by the opposition.|$|E
500|$|In a twist from expectation, Eliot's poem {{suggests}} that old men <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and explore. He warns {{that people should}} trade wisdom for pointless experience and argues that men should explore human experience itself. This concept is hinted of in The Waste Land and draws from the ideas within Dante's Convivio. Dante argues that old men are supposed to return to God and describes the process in a way similar to the travels of Odysseus. Unlike Homer's hero, Dante argues that men should not travel in the material world but in the spiritual world. Both Dante and Eliot put forth a similar view to St. Augustine when they focus on internal travels. Through these travels, mankind is able to have faith in salvation and {{able to see that}} there is more to the world than darkness. Eliot explains within the poem that we are all interconnected through time and that we must realize this. Only through this realization is mankind able to understand the truth of the universe. This, in turn, would allow humanity to break free from the burden of time. As Russel Kirk explains: [...] "That end, for those who apprehend a reality superior to 'birth, copulation, and death'—a reality transcending the rhythms of physical nature—is to know God and enjoy Him forever." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding the {{controversial}} period of her career, Madonna said, [...] "I feel I've been misunderstood. I {{tried to make}} a statement about feeling good about yourself and exploring your sexuality, but people took it to mean that everyone <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and have sex with everyone, and that I {{was going to be the}} leader of that. So I decided to leave it alone because that's what everyone ended up concentrating on. Sex is such a taboo subject and it's such a distraction that I'd rather not even offer it up." [...] During 1994, Madonna started recording her sixth studio album. She collaborated with R producers such as Dallas Austin, Dave [...] "Jam" [...] Hall, and Babyface, and also enlisting British producer Nellee Hooper to the project. It became one of the very few occasions where she collaborated with well-known producers, the first since Nile Rodgers on Like a Virgin (1984). When asked about the record, Madonna said she wanted people to concentrate on the musical aspects of it, and would like the songs to speak for themselves. She also commented that it was because she was not interested in giving many interviews and being on the cover of magazines. She described the album as [...] "a combination of pop, R, hip-hop and a Madonna record. It's very, very romantic". In an interview with The Face magazine, Madonna explained her inspirations behind Bedtime Stories as well as the reason for teaming up with R song producers.|$|E

2500|$|... 1854 saw Caesar {{involved}} in controversy {{when he was}} playing for England against Nottinghamshire at Lord's. That year, the Marylebone Cricket Club, the guardian {{of the laws of}} cricket introduced a new rule permitting injured batsmen a runner so that they themselves did not have to run between the wickets. So when, in the second innings, Caesar was batting with John Wisden, and Caesar, perhaps suffering from gout, asked for a runner, William Buttress came out to substitute for him. Later Caesar drove a ball from William Clarke and, forgetting his runner, proceeded to make his own way to the opposite wicket, with Wisden also swapping ends. Buttress stayed still and Clarke put down the wicket at the bowler's end (where Caesar was). The umpire gave Wisden out, saying on the grounds that Buttress (Caesar's runner) and Wisden had not crossed. But Clarke disagreed and said Caesar should go. When the umpire refused, Clarke and Nottinghamshire walked off. Bell's Life reported that [...] "After a long argument at the pavilion, it was decided that Caesar <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>out.</b> Neither the striker nor the substitute being off their ground, we are of the opinion (according to the law) that Wisden ought to have been given out, although the case would have been very hard indeed." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} there was not a mighty man in the world more {{difficult}} to overcome than Og, as [...] says, [...] "only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim." [...] The Midrash told that Og had been the only survivor of the strong men whom Amraphel and his colleagues had slain, as may be inferred from [...] which reports that Amraphel [...] "smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim," [...] and one may read [...] to indicate that Og lived near Ashteroth. The Midrash taught that Og was the refuse among the Rephaim, like a hard olive that escapes being mashed in the olive press. The Midrash inferred this from [...] which reports that [...] "there came one who had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew," [...] and the Midrash identified the man who had escaped as Og, as [...] describes him as a remnant, saying, [...] "only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim." [...] The Midrash taught that Og intended that Abram <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and be killed. God rewarded Og for delivering the message by allowing him to live all the years from Abraham to Moses, but God collected Og's debt to God for his evil intention toward Abraham by causing Og to fall by the hand of Abraham's descendants. On coming to make war with Og, Moses was afraid, thinking that he was only 120 years old, while Og was more than 500 years old, and if Og had not possessed some merit, he would not have lived all those years. So God told Moses (in the words of [...] ), [...] "fear him not; for I have delivered him into your hand," [...] implying that Moses should slay Og with his own hand.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} {{according}} to some authorities, Israel fought Sihon {{in the month of}} Elul, celebrated the Festival in Tishri, and after the Festival fought Og. The Midrash inferred this from the similarity of the expression in [...] "And you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents," [...] which speaks of an act that was to follow the celebration of a Festival, and the expression in [...] "and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people." [...] The Midrash inferred that God assembled the Amorites to deliver them into the Israelites' hands, as [...] says, [...] "and the Lord said to Moses: ‘Fear him not; for I have delivered him into your hand." [...] The Midrash taught that Moses was afraid, as he thought that perhaps the Israelites had committed a trespass in the war against Sihon, or had soiled themselves by the commission of some transgression. God reassured Moses that he need not fear, for the Israelites had shown themselves perfectly righteous. The Midrash taught that there was not a mighty man in the world more difficult to overcome than Og, as [...] says, [...] "only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim." [...] The Midrash told that Og had been the only survivor of the strong men whom Amraphel and his colleagues had slain, as may be inferred from [...] which reports that Amraphel [...] "smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim," [...] and one may read [...] to indicate that Og lived near Ashteroth.

[...] The Midrash concluded that the Israelites utterly destroyed the people so as not to derive any benefit from them.|$|E
