Would he have ranged them with his desolate heart and soul, his wasted life, his peace and his despair? The very first sacrifice that he represented himself as making for her, was his fidelity to his dear boy after death. Surely these facts were strong against a fancy that scarcely dared to hint itself. And yet he was so terrible a man! In short, the poor girl (for what could she know of the criminal intellect, which its own professed students perpetually misread, because they persist in trying to reconcile it with the average intellect of average men, instead of identifying it as a horrible wonder apart) could get by no road to any other conclusion than that he was a terrible man, and must be fled from.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{multicast}} operation used by MPI under Grid {{environment can}} have a substantial impact on performance of parallel applications. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> an optimal multicast operation is an NP-hard problem, a near-optimal heuristic is crucial for building an efficient MPI runtime. This paper presents a new multicast algorithm called Longest Parallel Branch First (LPBF). This algorithm enhances the performance of multicast operation by exploiting {{the knowledge of the}} Grid two-level topology, cluster size, and inter/intracluster link bandwidths. This is done by reducing the intercluster multicast traffic and maximizing the opportunity for communication overlapping using an intelligent message scheduling. The experiments show that the LPBF algorithm offers a substantial improvement over previously proposed algorithms, such as ECEF (Earliest Completing Edge First) and Binomial Tree Algorithm. Thus, LPBF is a simple, fast, and offer a potential to improve MPI runtime performance on the Grid. 1...|$|E
30|$|Obesity, worldwide, is {{becoming}} a major problem with {{an increased risk of}} several common diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [13, 14]. It is generally accepted that hypoxia is related to sleep apnea in obesity. This concept has changed <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> hypoxia response in adipose tissue of obese mice in 2005. Adipose tissue is a key endocrine organ as it releases multiple bioactive substances, known as adipose-derived secreted factors or adipokines, that have pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory activities [15]. Recent studies consistently support a hypoxia response in the adipose tissue in obese animals. The observations have {{led to the formation of}} an exciting concept: adipose tissue hypoxia (ATH), in the understanding of major disorders associated with obesity [16]. Prof. Jianping Ye, Louisiana State University, addressed the Hypoxia in Obesity-From Bench to Bedside. The ATH provides a unified answer to all of the pathological changes in the adipose tissue under obesity, such as chronic inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, leptin expression, adiponectin reduction, adipocyte death and elevated lipolysis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Sulfate {{assimilation}} is {{a pathway}} providing reduced sulfur for {{the synthesis of}} cysteine, methionine, co-enzymes such as iron-sulfur centres, thiamine, lipoic acid, or Coenzyme A, and many secondary metabolites, e. g., glucosinolates or al-liins. The pathway is relatively well understood in flowering plants, but very little information exists on sulfate assimilation in basal land plants. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> a putative 3 ′-phospho-adenosine 5 ′-phosphosulfate reductase in Physcomitrella patens, an enigmatic enzyme thought to exist in fungi and some bacte-ria only, it has been evident that sulfur metabolism in lower plants may substantially differ from seed plant models. The ge-nomic sequencing of two basal plant species, the Bryophyte Physcomitrella patens, and the Lycophyte Selaginella moellendorf-fii, opens up the possibility to search for differences between lower and higher plants at the genomic level. Here we describe {{the similarities and differences}} in the organisation of the sulfate assimilation pathway between basal and advanced land plants derived from genome comparisons of these two species with Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, two seed plants with se-quenced genomes. We found differences in the number of genes encoding sulfate transporters, adenosine 5 ′-phosphosul-fate reductase, and sulfite reductase between the lower and higher plants.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the prevalence of coexistent occult vascular malformations (OVMs) and developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) and to investigate the relationship between them. METHODS: One hundred two patients with OVMs were examined with precontrast and postcontrast T 1 -weighted MR imaging and with noncontrast T 2 -weighted MR imaging. Seventy-two patients had surgery, with subsequent pathologic confirmation of the final diagnosis. RESULTS: Coexistent DVAs and OVMs were present in 23 (23 %) of 102 patients. Seventy-nine patients had OVMs without DVAs, and in this population, multiple OVMs (from two to 10 or more) were seen in 13 patients (16 %). In contrast, multiple OVMs were seen in 10 (43 %) of 23 patients with coexisting OVMs and DVAs. Twenty-five (83 %) of 30 OVMs coexisting with DVAs were infratentorial. In 72 patients with surgically resected OVMs, 49 (68 %) had pathologically confirmed cavernous malformations. Among the patients with coexistent DVAs, seven (46 %) had cavernous malformations, four (27 %) had thrombosed arteriovenous malformations, and four (27 %) had vascular malformations that were not classifiable. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a high prevalence of OVMs with coexistent DVAs, and {{a high percentage of}} these were in the posterior fossa. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging may increase the probability of finding these lesions, and therefore should be considered part of the preoperative evaluation, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> unexpected coexistent lesions may affect surgical management...|$|E

40|$|Introduction & Objective: The {{previous}} studies investigating alexithymia in psychotic patients indicated that such patients have difficulty in identifying and expressing their feelings. The {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate the extent of alexithymia in patients with psychotic disorders, non psychotic disorders, and normal people. Materials & Methods: In this causal-comparative study 60 psychotic, 60 non-psychotic patients and 140 students were selected via available sampling method (the results of Leven's test indicated the homogeneity of variance among the three groups). Using Torento Alexithymia Scale(TAS- 20),we compared them with each others. Results: Results showed that the extent of alexithymia in psychotic and non-psychotic patients was higher than that of normal people(P< 0. 001). Also the extent of difficulty in identifying, describing feelings and externally-oriented thinking is more serious in psychotic patients than in the other groups and more severe in men than women. Conclusion: <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study showed that psychotic patients are more inflected with high level of alexithymia, it is essential to contrive a special treatment (such as Emotional- focused therapy) to decrease alexithymia in these patients...|$|R
