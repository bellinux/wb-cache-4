40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{validity}} of the microcounseling paradigm in teaching a basic counseling and interpersonal skill, attending behavior, to ninth grade students. The experimental design involved training of eight students in attending skills and comparing their interviewing effectiveness with eight untrained students.

The experimental group demonstrated significantly in-creased verbal and non-verbal attending behaviors on 7 of 13 comparisons. The implications of microcounseling for the teaching of communication skills to clients is discussed.

40|$|The {{previously}} equivocal {{relationship between}} sex-role identity (masculinityfemininity) in late-adolescent females and adjustment was investigated. Peer ratings of 30 college Ss, obtained {{after a period}} of small-group interaction, indicated that masculine girls tended to be both goal oriented (instrumental) and socially sensitive (expressive), whereas feminine girls tended to be socially sensitive but to lack a goal orientation. Comparison of the personality attributes of these masculine and feminine girls with their maladjusted counterparts found little difference between the feminine groups. However, comparison of the masculine groups identified more extended differences, primarily indicating a lack of instrumental behavior in the maladjusted group. Masculinity in the maladjusted group may appear as social independence which may actually mask social alienation and social approach-avoidance conflicts.

Treatment consisted of the <b>systematic</b> application of <b>reinforcement</b> principles, including the use of peer-group reinforcement. The subjects were observed for 10 seconds at the first minute of every 5 minutes using a behavior problem checklist designed for the study. Their reactions to group and individual reinforcements were noted and compared to reading achievement. Among the findings were that subjects improved consistently in appropriate social behavior and in most cases group reinforcement proved superior to individually distributed reinforcers. Significant correlations were obtained between characteristics measured by the checklist, academic gains, and social behavior. Tables and a bibliography are included. (MS...|$|R

The prognosis for nonsubstance abuse psychiatric diagnoses among homeless persons receiving behaviorally-based addiction treatment, however, is little studied. Results Data from an addiction treatment trial for 95 cocaine-dependent homeless persons (1996 – 1998) were used to profile psychiatric diagnoses at baseline and 6 months, including mood-related disorders (e. g. depression) and anxiety-related disorders (e. g. post-traumatic stress disorder). Treatment interventions, including <b>systematic</b> <b>reinforcement</b> for goal attainment, were behavioral in orientation. There was a 32 % reduction in the prevalence of comorbid non-addiction psychiatric disorder from baseline to 6 months, with similar reductions in the prevalence of mood (- 32 %) and anxiety-related disorders (- 20 %) (p = 0. 12). Conclusion Among cocaine-dependent homeless persons with psychiatric comorbidity undergoing behavioral addiction treatment, a reduction in comorbid psychiatric disorder prevalence was observed over 6 months.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{research}} is to juxtapose the features of microfinancing and the institutional forbearance of economic development in Nigeria. Based on empirical study, it has been observed that poverty is multifaceted and its persistence is due to lack of productive resources. The Nigerian case reveals that the major constraint to improving the standard of living of the poor is capital (finance). This has restricted their extensive participation in economic activities which could improve their lives. For this study, our theoretical a priori expectation is that provision of microfinance services such as savings and microloans have direct impact on GDP. A causal relationship will be established and evaluated with the ‘t-test’ statistic, while the relevance of the independent variables in explaining the subject will be justified based on the F-statistic test and R 2 coefficient of multi-determination. Also, using a lin-log regression model, economic growth shall be regressed on poverty level in Nigeria. This will create an assertion whether Nigeria needs a <b>systematic</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of the microfinance mechanism to propagate a soothing trend for poverty reduction and economic growth. ...|$|E

40|$|According to {{data from}} the U. S. Census Bureau (2012), the United States is the world's fifth most populous Spanish-speaking country, with over 35 million Spanish-speakers. In addition, Spanish is the most widely taught foreign {{language}} in the United States, with more students enrolled in Spanish at the higher-education level than in all other modern languages combined, as detailed in a 2010 report from the Modern Language Association (MLA). How are these two realities connected? Is the United States' status as a top Spanish-speaking country reflected in Spanish as a Foreign Language (SFL) and Spanish as a Heritage Language (SHL) curricula at the university level?

40|$|Abstract The {{community}} reinforcement approach (CRA) {{has been}} applied {{in the treatment of}} disorders resulting from alcohol, cocaine and opioid use. The objectives were to review the effectiveness of (1) CRA compared with usual care, and (2) CRA versus CRA plus contingency management. Studies were selected through a literature search of RCTs focusing on substance abuse. The search yielded 11 studies of mainly high methodological quality. The results of CRA, when compared to usual care: there is strong evidence that CRA is more effective with regard to number of drinking days, and conflicting evidence with regard to continuous abstinence in the alcohol treatment. There is moderate evidence that CRA with disulfiram is more effective in terms of number of drinking days, and limited evidence that there is no difference in effect in terms of continuous abstinence. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that CRA with ‘incentives’ is more effective with regard to cocaine abstinence. There is limited evidence that CRA with ‘incentives’ is more effective in an opioid detoxification program. There is limited evidence that CRA is more effective in a methadone maintenance program. Finally, there is strong evidence that CRA with abstinence-contingent ‘incentives’ is more effective than CRA (non-contingent incentives) treatment aimed at cocaine abstinence.

40|$|Exacerbations of COPD {{are a major}} global importance. They have a {{profound}} negative effect on patients, resulting in poor health status; they accelerate the progression of the disease; and account for a large proportion the increasing healthcare spending on COPD. Yet, controversies remain over the definition of exacerbations, how they should be monitored and their underlying mechanisms. Early recognition of exacerbations and prompt treatment (decreased treatment delay) have shown to ameliorate recovery while improving health-related {{quality of life and}} reducing the risk of hospital admission. This thesis deals with different aspects of exacerbations, i. e. definitions, self-management behaviour during periods of symptom-aggravation and potential methods to enhance early detection and treatment of such events. To answer our main research questions we performed two systematic reviews, and three prospective cohort studies including a multicenter randomized trial (ACZiE study). In summary the main conclusions and recommendations were: 1) There is insufficient evidence to distinguish ‘harmless’ subtypes of exacerbations not necessitating anticipation by patients or healthcare providers. For now, current practice guidelines, indicating prompt recognition and treatment of each exacerbation, should be followed. 2) An individualized action plan is a low-burden intervention, which accelerates exacerbation recovery, severity and impact of exacerbations on health status. 3) Action plans are clearly not single-moment paper interventions, but concerns an individually tailored and dynamic process of <b>systematic</b> updates and <b>reinforcement.</b> Effective implementation requires a designated case-manager and clear arrangements between patients and healthcare providers. 4) Although evidence for effectiveness of telemedicine interventions is still relatively scarce, partly due to high heterogeneity of interventions, it has shown to be feasible in patients with COPD. Current technological developments provide an almost infinite variety of flexible solutions to closely monitor patients’ health status and to provide remote self-management support. 5) Strategies to enhance early detection and prompt treatment of exacerbations should be individually tailored. The pivotal objective remains to change patient behaviour for better disease control, and adequate anticipation {{in the event of an}} exacerbation. However, for certain sub-populations of patients this might not be sufficient and additional treatment modalities (surveillance / monitoring) might be indicated or should be augmented (self-management support / reinforcement). Future research implications were: 1) Before concluding EXACT-PRO to be the new ‘golden standard’, prospective studies are needed to evaluate its diagnostic properties in assessing exacerbation onset, covering the heterogeneity of COPD and its exacerbations. In absence of a ‘golden standard’, future prospective trials should assess exacerbations using the modified Anthonisen algorithm, completed by event–based counts. 2) To ensure optimal validity of diary-based exacerbation assessment, at least five vital requirements should be met (general discussion). 3) In addition to the importance of exacerbation frequency, future trials evaluating effectiveness of new treatments should also include severity, duration and health status impact. 4) Future trials are needed to compare simple and more sophisticated (tele-) monitoring modalities. Evaluation of effectiveness should also include exacerbation-related outcome: frequency, severity, duration and treatment-delay...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{finding of}} a 1 -bond→ 2 -phonon {{behavior}} at the zone center in several A 1 −xBxC random zincblende mixed crystals, that mirrors a similar 1 -bond→ 2 -mode {{behavior in the}} bond length distribution, deviates strongly from the traditional 1 -bond→ 1 -mode (phonon, bond length) description of the local lattice relaxation in alloys, and thereby forces to rethink the scenario of spontaneous ordering (SO) in its entirety. Here we tackle this key issue, from both the experimental and theoretical sides, by focusing our attention upon the ‘model ’ Zn 1 −xBexSe system. This alloy exhibits a large contrast in the bond properties, which should stimulate SO to some extent, and is at the origin of a uniquely well-resolved 1 -bond→ 2 -mode Raman behavior for the short Be-Se species, potentially a highly sensitive probe of SO. SO in Zn 1 −xBexSe (0 <x≤ 0. 92) is identified from the transverse optical Raman spectra as a slight but <b>systematic</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of the low-frequency Be-Se mode, that refers to the ‘longer ’ bonds from the Be-rich region, {{to the detriment of}} the high-frequency Be-Se counterpart, due to the ‘shorter ’ bonds from the Zn-rich region. This way the overall contrast between the Zn-Se (long) and Be-Se (short) bond lengths is reduced in the alloy, leading to higher crystal stability. The underlying mechanism of local Zn and Be segregation into a series of alternating cationic planes finds thus a natural explanation, which was still lacking.

However, evidence regarding effective interventions is limited and strategies to improve the nutritional status of this population are required. This presentation describes the implementation and results of a pilot randomised controlled trial of a multi-component intervention for improving the nutritional status of RACF residents with dementia. Method Fifteen residents with moderate-severe dementia living in a secure long-term RACF participated in a five week pilot study. Participants were randomly allocated to either an Intervention (n= 8) or Control group (n= 7). The intervention comprised four elements delivered in a separate dining room at lunch and dinner: the <b>systematic</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of residents’ eating behaviors using a specific communication protocol; family-style dining; high ambiance table presentation; and routine Dietary-Nutrition Champion supervision. Control group participants ate their meals according to the facility’s standard practice. Baseline and follow-up assessments of nutritional status, food consumption, and body mass index were obtained by qualified nutritionists. Additional assessments included measures of cognitive functioning, mealtime agitation, depression, wandering status and multiple measures of intervention fidelity. Results No participant was malnourished at study commencement and participants in both groups gained weight from follow-up to baseline which was not significantly different between groups (t= 0. 43; p= 0. 67). A high degree of treatment fidelity was evident throughout the intervention. Qualitative data from staff indicate the intervention was perceived to be beneficial for residents. Conclusions This multi-component nutritional intervention was well received and was feasible in the RACF setting. Participants’ sound nutritional status at baseline likely accounts {{for the lack of}} an intervention effect. Further research using this protocol in malnourished residents is recommended.
