The news never tells us about the social workers, but in this inferno {{and elsewhere in the}} country many social workers are trying to work with street children, in nurseries, institutions, offices and among the people who suffer from the bombings, with drug addicts, traumatized children, the mentally disordered and other disadvantaged groups. Due to the difficult situation in the country there is little support from inter-national organizations, many of whom have withdrawn from the country in fear for the safety of their employees.
