In late 1997, the locomotive received new IGBT based converters, which were the first application of this technology in locomotives around the world. In early 1998, the traction control electronics was also replaced. [...] The locomotive also received its final livery, with rainbow-coloured wave patterns on the sidewalls.

40|$|Abstract—In {{traditional}} {{automatic test}} solutions, a test engine usually encompasses all functions in its kernel, including compiling test program, generating test event chain, scheduling test process and executing test events. This makes the engine tightly coupled with test {{language and the}} <b>system</b> under <b>test,</b> {{so that it is}} difficult to maintain, optimize and extend the test engine. In order to solve these problems, a micro-kernel test engine is designed and implemented based on the service oriented architecture. This micro-kernel approach decouples function modules to make the test engine kernel independent of the <b>system</b> under <b>test</b> and the test language. This also makes the test engine more modularized, so that the debugging process and maintenance work of the engine can be much easier. With new compiling component and test adapters, the engine kernel can be extended for new test methods or reused in new test applications. The application example and extensibility analysis discussed in section 6 show the feasibility of this micro-kernel test engine.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the SpeechRater TM <b>system</b> of Educational <b>Testing</b> <b>Service</b> (ETS), a fully operational automated scoring system for non-native spontaneous speech employed in a practice context. This novel system stands in contrast to most prior speech scoring systems which focus on fairly predictable, low entropy speech such as read-aloud speech or short and predictable responses. We motivate our approach by grounding our work in the TOEFL ® iBT speaking construct ("what constitutes a speaker's ability to speak comprehensibly, coherently and appropriately?") and rubrics ("what levels of proficiency do we expect to observe for different score levels in different aspects or dimensions of speech?"). SpeechRater consists of three main components: the speech recognizer, trained on about 30 hours of non-native speech, the feature computation module, computing about 40 features predominantly in the fluency dimension, and the scoring model, which combines a selected set of speech features to predict a speaking score using multiple regression. On the task of estimating the total score for a set of three responses, our best model achieves a correlation of 0. 67 with human scores and a quadratically weighted kappa of 0. 61, which compares to an inter-human correlation of 0. 94 and an inter-human weighted kappa of 0. 93. 1...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{an extensive}} effort made {{to understand how}} to effectively use the various diagnostic technologies to establish the condition of medium voltage underground cable circuits. These circuits make up an extensive portion of the electric delivery infrastructure in the United States. Much of this infrastructure is old and experiencing unacceptable failure rates. By deploying efficient diagnostic testing programs, electric utilities can replace or repair circuits that are about to fail, providing an optimal approach to improving electric system reliability. This is an intrinsically complex topic. Underground cable systems are not homogeneous. Cable circuits often contain multiple branches with different cable designs and a range of insulation materials. In addition, each insulation material ages differently as a function of time, temperature and operating environment. To complicate matters further, there are a wide variety of diagnostic technologies available for assessing the condition of cable circuits with a diversity of claims about the effectiveness of each approach. As a result, the benefits of deploying cable diagnostic testing programs have been difficult to establish, leading many utilities to avoid the their use altogether. This project was designed to help address these issues. The information provided {{is the result of a}} collaborative effort between Georgia Tech NEETRAC staff, Georgia Tech academic faculty, electric utility industry participants, as well as cable <b>system</b> diagnostic <b>testing</b> <b>service</b> providers and <b>test</b> equipment providers. Report topics include: •How cable systems age and fail, •The various technologies available for detecting potential failure sites, •The advantages and disadvantages of different diagnostic technologies, •Different approaches for utilities to employ cable system diagnostics.

Offline calculation can be used for calculating performance metrics of a previously per-formed experiment, so on the set of ground truths and estimates.
