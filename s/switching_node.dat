50|$|Later work at BBN Technologies {{showed how}} to use the link-state {{technique}} in a hierarchical system (i.e., one in which the network was divided into areas) so that each <b>switching</b> <b>node</b> does not need a map of the entire network, only the area(s) in which it is included.|$|E
5000|$|Frame Check Sequence (FCS) Field. Since one cannot {{completely}} {{ignore the}} bit error-rate of the medium, each <b>switching</b> <b>node</b> needs to implement error detection to avoid wasting bandwidth {{due to the}} transmission of erred frames.

Simple hardware logic can arrange fail-overs to redundant links.|$|E

50|$|The Frame Relay network uses a {{simplified}} protocol at each <b>switching</b> <b>node.</b> It achieves simplicity by omitting link-by-link flow-control. As a result, the offered load has largely determined {{the performance of}} Frame Relay networks. When offered load is high, due to the bursts in some services, temporary overload at some Frame Relay nodes causes a collapse in network throughput. Therefore, Frame Relay networks require some effective mechanisms to control the congestion.|$|E
5000|$|His {{developmental}} research on optical CDMA initiated a new research {{field in which}} more than 1000 papers have since been published, exploring applications ranging from information security to communication speed and bandwidth. In 1993, he invented the [...] "Terahertz Optical Asymmetric Demultiplexer," [...] the first optical switch capable of processing terabit per second (Tb/s) pulse trains. With support from DARPA in the 1990s, his group was the first to demonstrate an all-optical 100 gigabit/sec photonic packet <b>switching</b> <b>node</b> and optical multiprocessor interconnect.|$|E
50|$|For any 'i' {{greater than}} zero, a <b>switching</b> <b>node</b> N(i,j) gets {{connected}} to N(i-1, j) and N(i-1, m), where 'm' is obtained by flipping the ith {{most significant bit}} of j. For example, consider the node N(1,6): i equals 1 and j equals 6, therefore m is obtained by flipping the first most significant bit of 6.As a result the nodes connected to N(1,6) are :-Thus, N(0,6), N(1,6), N(0,2), N(1,2) form a butterfly pattern. Several butterfly patterns exist in the figure and therefore, this network is called Butterfly Network.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the role of}} switching in minimizing the number of electronic ports (e. g., SONET ADMs) in an optical network that carries sub-wavelength traffic. Providing nodes {{with the ability to}} switch traffic between wavelengths, such as through the use of SONET cross-connects, can reduce the required number of electronic ports. We show that only small switches at multiple <b>switching</b> <b>nodes</b> are needed for significant reductions in the number of ports. We provide a lower bound on the number of electronic ports that {{is a function of the}} number of <b>switching</b> <b>nodes.</b> We show that our lower bound is relatively tight by providing routing and grooming algorithms that nearly achieve the bound. For uniform traffic, we show that the number of electronic ports is reduced when the number of <b>switching</b> <b>nodes</b> used is approximately equal to the number of wavelengths of traffic generated by each node. Finally, we provide a general upper bound on the amount of switching required in the network. For uniform traffic, our bound shows that as the size of the network increases, each traffic stream must be switched at most once (at one of the <b>switching</b> <b>nodes)</b> in order to achieve the minimum port count. ...|$|R

30|$|However, further examined, local {{coordination}} routing has a contrasting {{approach with}} MSCRP. In local coordination routing, {{in order to}} balance the load between nodes, it is encouraged to redirect flows to neighboring <b>nodes,</b> thus creating <b>switching</b> <b>nodes</b> occurring side by side. This violates the deafness problem constraint, that is, two consecutive nodes serving the same flow should not be <b>switching</b> <b>nodes.</b> It is difficult to decide which approach is better since MSCRP results in significant network throughput improvement and local coordination-based routing results in low cumulative delay.|$|R
50|$|The link-state {{protocol}} {{is performed}} by every <b>switching</b> <b>node</b> {{in the network}} (i.e., nodes that are prepared to forward packets; in the Internet, these are called routers). The basic concept of link-state routing is that every node constructs {{a map of the}} connectivity to the network, {{in the form of a}} graph, showing which nodes are connected to which other nodes. Each node then independently calculates the next best logical path from it to every possible destination in the network. Each collection of best paths will then form each node's routing table.|$|E
50|$|The {{control signals}} in Class T {{amplifiers}} may be computed using {{digital signal processing}} or fully analog techniques. Currently available implementations use a loop similar to a higher order Delta-Sigma (ΔΣ) (or sigma-delta) modulator, with an internal digital clock to control the sample comparator. The two key aspects of this topology are that (1), feedback is taken directly from the <b>switching</b> <b>node</b> rather than the filtered output, and (2), the higher order loop provides much higher loop gain at high audio frequencies than would be possible in a conventional single pole amplifier.|$|E
5000|$|The Interface Message Processor (IMP) was {{the packet}} <b>switching</b> <b>node</b> used to {{interconnect}} participant networks to the ARPANET {{from the late}} 1960s to 1989. It was {{the first generation of}} gateways, which are known today as routers. An IMP was a ruggedized Honeywell DDP-516 minicomputer with special-purpose interfaces and software. [...] In later years the IMPs were made from the non-ruggedized Honeywell 316 which could handle two-thirds of the communication traffic at approximately one-half the cost. An IMP requires the connection to a host computer via a special bit-serial interface, defined in BBN Report 1822. The IMP software and the ARPA network communications protocol running on the IMPs was discussed in RFC 1, {{the first of a series}} of standardization documents published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Traffic {{grooming}} {{is important}} in the design and oper-ation of translucent optical networks. This paper investigates sub-wavelength traffic grooming in a translucent optical network and shows how to take advantage of sub-wavelength traffic grooming capability of sparsely distributed opaque <b>switch</b> <b>nodes.</b> An efficient heuristic, called the virtual nodal degree ranked algorithm, is em-ployed to select the best locations for opaque <b>switch</b> <b>nodes.</b> New mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization models are developed to optimally groom sub-wavelength traffic demand in the translucent optical network. The models maximize served sub-wavelength traffic demand under a limited network capacity and minimize required wavelength capacity subject to the condi-tion that all the traffic demands are served. The models are novel in optimization methodology because they incorporate both the arc-node and the arc-path multi-commodity optimization techniques for a single problem. Based on simulation studies, it is found that the performance of sub-wavelength traffic grooming of a translu-cent network is substantially improved by increasing the number of opaque <b>switch</b> <b>nodes.</b> For some network topologies, the perfor-mance saturates as the number of opaque <b>switch</b> <b>nodes</b> increases, though the phenomenon is not general for any type of network topology.

5000|$|In a wrapped {{butterfly}} network (which means rank 0 gets {{merged with}} rank 3. In figure 2, it {{is shown by}} replicating the processor nodes below rank 3), a message is sent from processor 5 to processor 2. The packet transmitted over the link is of the form: The header contains the destination of the message, which is processor 2 (010 in binary). The payload is the message 'M' and trailer contains checksum. Therefore the actual message transmitted from processor 5 is:Upon reaching a <b>switching</b> <b>node,</b> {{one of the two}} output links is selected based on the most significant bit of the destination address. If that bit is zero, the left link is selected. If that bit is one, the right link is selected. Subsequently, this bit is removed from the destination address in the packet transmitted through the selected link. This is shown in figure 2.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the analog subscriber Call Generator (CG) for the SI 2000 V 5 <b>switch</b> <b>node.</b> It provides developers with the test environment without the use of external testing units. The proposed architecture assures effective tests of program layers above the driver of analog subscriber circuits. This was accomplished with minimal changes of the existing program code and application of the existing communication procedures. Compared to external testing units, the software Call Generator possesses some limitations. Because of the software nature of its operation, electrical interfaces on analog subscriber line circuits are not tested for proper operation. Also, usual audio checks of the connection are not performed. The call generator can be extended with this functionality, but this would demand greater changes of the existing program code and an additional use of digital signal processing resources. This would impose unnatural performance of the <b>switch</b> <b>node</b> under test. Testing without using external testing units represents the main achievement for the developer. For the CG operation, only an IP connection between the developer’s workstation and the tested <b>switch</b> <b>node</b> is required.
