25|$|For this generation, the Supra {{received}} a new six-speed Getrag/Toyota V160 gearbox on the turbo models while the naturally aspirated models made {{do with a}} five-speed manual W58, revised from the previous version. Each model was offered with a four-speed automatic with manual shifting mode. All vehicles were equipped with five-spoke aluminium alloy wheels, the naturally aspirated model had 16-inch wheels and the turbo models were 17-inch. The difference in wheel size was to accommodate the larger brakes equipped as standard onto the turbo model, but in Japan were optional extras. Both models had a space saver spare tire on a <b>steel</b> <b>rim</b> to save both space and weight.|$|E
2500|$|The basket is a <b>steel</b> <b>rim</b> [...] {{diameter}} with an attached net {{affixed to}} a backboard that measures [...] and one basket is {{at each end}} of the court. The white outlined box on the backboard is [...] high and [...] wide. At almost all levels of competition, the top of the rim is exactly [...] above the court and [...] inside the baseline. While variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard, it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct height – a rim that is off by just a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting.|$|E
2500|$|... 1976 models {{featured}} steel {{floor panels}} shielding the catalytic converter exhaust. These steel floor panels weighed {{less than the}} previous fiberglass floor and reduced interior noise levels. Horsepower rose to [...] for the base L-48 engine; [...] for the optional L-82. To further reduce cabin noise levels, cowl induction was dropped {{in favor of the}} air cleaner ducted over the radiator, picking up outside air {{from the front of the}} car, thus reducing wind turbulence at the base of the windshield. The hood was carried over, with its cowl vent grille and induction system opening becoming non-functional. The optional cast aluminum wheels were finally made available, which reduced the unsprung weight of the car by 32pounds. Nearly 15% of the cars were ordered with the new wheels at a cost of $299. A standard <b>steel</b> <b>rim</b> spare was used. This was the last year for optional white striped tires, as 86% of the cars were being delivered with the optional white lettered tires. A new rear nameplate for the rear bumper cover was introduced, eliminating the individual [...] "Corvette" [...] letters used since 1968. An unwelcome change was the [...] "Vega GT" [...] 4-spoke steering wheel, although its smaller diameter did provide extra room and eased entry/exit. The steering wheel, color-keyed to the interior, continued on 1977 through 1979 models, limited to non-tilt wheel cars only. GM's [...] "Freedom" [...] battery, a new sealed and maintenance-free unit, was now installed in all cars. The rear window defroster option was changed from the forced-air type of previous years to the new [...] "Electro-Clear" [...] defogger, an in-glass heated element type. Even without a convertible model, the Corvette still set new sales records.|$|E

5000|$|Volvo {{introduced}} its first heavy truck in 1931. Unlike its smaller sibling, who used some elements from Volvo’s passenger cars, the LV66-series components were built exclusively for truck use. [...] These included a new overhead valve engine, a heavy duty four-speed gear box, <b>steel</b> <b>rims</b> and four-wheel hydraulic brakes.|$|R

5000|$|Helmet, Steel, Mark I: {{introduced}} in Spring, 1916, {{a modified version}} of the Brodie helmet with a wholly redesigned liner and a mild <b>steel</b> <b>rim</b> to the shell. In 1917, a rubber ring or [...] "doughnut" [...] was added between the liner and the top of the shell, and in 1935, the liner and chinstrap were modified to make them removable.|$|E
50|$|The Ghia {{models were}} {{similarly}} equipped to UK models, {{but only the}} 2.3-litre V6 models featured imported Ford alloy wheels. Ford 'Rostyle' <b>steel</b> <b>rims</b> were fitted to all 2.0 GL, Ghia and S models, optionally on the other models. New Zealand Ghia models, however, did not feature a steel sliding sunroof (fitted as standard on UK Ghia models), although some models did feature an aftermarket sunroof.|$|R
50|$|In 1977, the UO-10 was introduced, {{followed}} {{the next year}} by a slightly heavier road model, the UO-9. The UO-10 was largely {{the same as the}} UO-8 but with aluminum alloy cotterless crankset and aluminum alloy rims. The UO-9 was essentially the same as the UO-10 but had cheaper and heavier <b>steel</b> <b>rims.</b> In 1980, the PH-8 displaced the UO-8 as the entry-level Peugeot road bicycle.|$|R
50|$|Later wartime {{developments}} simplified the suspension. By 1939, the Soviets {{found that}} the BT tank's convertible drive was an unnecessary complication which occupied valuable space in the tank, and the feature was dropped in the T-34. The original Christie suspension used large rubber-rimmed road wheels but wartime rubber shortages forced some T-34 factories to use wheels with sprung <b>steel</b> <b>rims</b> to be used instead. Most T34s, however, continued to be built with rubber-rimmed tires.|$|R
50|$|Oddjob acts as Goldfinger's {{personal}} chauffeur, bodyguard {{and golf}} caddy. He wears a Sandringham hat (unlike in the novel, where {{he wore a}} bowler) with a sharpened <b>steel</b> <b>rim,</b> {{using it as a}} lethal weapon in the style of a chakram or a flying guillotine. It was shown to be very powerful, capable of cutting through steel and decapitating a stone statue. He later uses it to kill Tilly Masterson by breaking her neck.|$|E

50|$|The basket is a <b>steel</b> <b>rim</b> 18 in {{diameter}} with an attached net affixed to a backboard that measures 6 by 3.5 ft and one basket is {{at each end}} of the court. The white outlined box on the backboard is 18 in high and 2 ft wide. At almost all levels of competition, the top of the rim is exactly 10 ft above the court and 4 ft inside the baseline. While variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard, it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct height - a rim that is off by just a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting.|$|E
50|$|Operators {{must take}} care to be {{magnetic}}ally clean and should check the 'magnetic hygiene' of all apparel and items carried during a survey. Akubra hats are very popular in Australia, but their <b>steel</b> <b>rims</b> must be removed before use on magnetic surveys. Steel rings on notepads, steel capped boots and steel springs in overall eyelets can all cause unnecessary noise in surveys. Pens, mobile phones and stainless steel implants can also be problematic.|$|R
50|$|The Standard is {{equipped}} with 13-inch <b>steel</b> <b>rims</b> and hubcaps carried over from the second generation Saga. Both Executive and Premium variants feature new alloy wheels. Proton has fitted their 14-inch 'snowflake' Y-spoke rims on the Executive, and 15-inch 'turbine' split-spoke rims on the Premium. Front fog lights are only available on the Executive and Premium lines. The new Saga is produced in six colours, namely Fire Red, Cotton White, Topaz Blue, Sterling Silver, Midnight Black, and Metal Grey.|$|R
50|$|Projector headlamp, Electronic Power Steering and dual airbags are {{standard}} across the range. The standard trim gets <b>steel</b> <b>rims</b> with caps, and other variants get alloy rims and Foglamps. The Automatic transmission lever is now relocated to the dashboard area like the Perodua Alza. An integrated 2-DIN 6-inch Touch Screen DVD Navigation system with Maps powered by Telekom Malaysia {{is available in}} the 1.3L Elegance and all 1.5L variants. The 1.3L Elegance and 1.5L Extreme variants also get chrome door handles and a different bodykit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{spare tire}} may be {{identical}} {{type and size}} to those on the vehicle. The spare may either be mounted on a plain <b>steel</b> <b>rim</b> or a matching road wheel as found on the vehicle. Among passenger vehicles, full-sized spares are usually provided for sport utility vehicles and light trucks, since a [...] "limited use" [...] spare would adversely affect such vehicles with higher centers of gravity. Additionally, a [...] "limited use" [...] spare may not be safe on a fully loaded truck or one that is towing a trailer. Due {{to the size of}} the full-sized spare, it is often mounted on the outside, such as the rear door of SUVs, and occasionally on the front hood.|$|E
50|$|The Westwood rim {{style of}} cycle rim used on {{bicycles}} {{was one of}} the original <b>steel</b> <b>rim</b> designs, developed during or before 1891 by Frederick Westwood of Birmingham. Bowden brakes and cables designed for use with this rim were introduced in 1896. Westwood rims have also been found ideal for use with drum brakes. They were last used on the roadster cycles found in Britain up to the 1980s and still common in South and East Asia and Africa and becoming common once again in Europe. Westwood rims have rounded sides, so they are not suitable for use with caliper brakes. Westwood rims features a wide single-wall cross section, the inside circumference of the rim has a contoured section shape to aid with strength. Today Westwood profile rims found in the West are mostly used in drum brake system roadsters and, to a lesser degree, in bicycles with coaster brake systems.|$|E
50|$|Most build-operate-transfer systems {{work in a}} {{way that}} the final {{manufacturer}} (OEM) doesn't invest in the production equipment for parts or components but instead procures these parts from a supplier who organises production on his equipment. An example from vehicle manufacturing might be the assembly of wheels and tyres. The OEM might decide not to invest in a wheel assembly line but instead obtain from a supplier or logistics service provider delivery of these items just in sequence as theses are needed at the OEM's assembly line: sometimes five with <b>steel</b> <b>rim</b> followed by four with light-alloy rim and a compact spare tire and so on. This is a longstanding and common methodology where the production and supply of many items and services are outsourced to other providers, typically to obtain better cost, quality and delivery performance than can be achieved in house, and also enable the OEM to better focus on core activities.|$|E
25|$|The Caprice PPV {{concept car}} {{was based on}} the Middle Eastern spec Caprice LS, which {{was based on the}} Holden WM Caprice Series I. The front end and grille are the same as the 2007-2010 Caprice LS. The Caprice letter is {{engraved}} into the chrome trim on the trunk, there is PPV lettering {{on the right side of}} the rear fascia and a FlexFuel nameplate, which was on GM vehicles in North America from 2007 through 2009. The PPV has dual exhaust, a floor shifter in the console, a prisoner partition with rifle and shotgun mounts, lights and siren controls in the console, 18 inch <b>steel</b> <b>rims</b> & center caps from the Impala 9C1, and a touch screen in place of the radio and HVAC controls. A prototype similar to the concept car in LAPD was shown around Australia by Holden. Another prototype tested by the LAPD had the same front end, grille, <b>steel</b> <b>rims</b> and center caps as the production models, while the car was based on the Series I WM Caprice with its rear bumper, colored turn signal indicators lamps on the side of the car, chrome trim with Caprice engraved on it, & V8 badge from the 2007-2010 Caprice.|$|R
50|$|In late 2006, Proton updated the Saga LMST in {{response}} to the 2005 launch of the Perodua Myvi. The Saga LMST received mainly cosmetic changes, namely a new Clarion integrated radio & CD player, meter cluster and redesigned air conditioner vents on the interior as well as a unique front grille, 14-inch <b>steel</b> <b>rims</b> with hubcaps and chromed head & taillights on the exterior. Proton added a new exhaust manifold and extractor to the tried and tested 1.3 L 4G13 carburetor-fed engine, increasing the Saga LMST power rating to 90 hp (68 kW) at 6,000rpm and 110Nm of torque at 4,200rpm, making the 2006 Saga LMST the fastest and most powerful in its lineage. However, these features and upgrades were only offered for the trim variant with power steering. The cheaper non-power steering variant was equipped with 13-inch <b>steel</b> <b>rims</b> & hubcaps, a cassette player and the exhaust manifold from the 2003 Saga LMST instead. It also lacked the rear spoiler, side skirts, power windows, alarm and central locking. The power-steering variant came with a choice of two paint options, namely orange and black whereas the non-power steering model was only sold in silver. Proton introduced this model in Pakistan on 15 September 2006.|$|R
5000|$|The {{series was}} envisioned as a [...] "bare-bones low {{performance}} model," [...] but the 98 Sport of 1953 became Ducati's [...] "first true sporting model." [...] The new design by Ducati's chief engineer, Giovanni Fiorio, {{made its debut}} at the 1952 Milan Show with the showing of the 98N and 98T (with twin seat). [...] The following year, the 98 Sport {{was presented at the}} same show, a lighter bike with alloy instead of chrome <b>steel</b> <b>rims,</b> and a higher state of tune, and the addition of a finned oil cooler {{at the front of the}} engine.|$|R
