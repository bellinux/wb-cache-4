5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Las Vegas Strip {{shooting}} on the evening of October 1, 2017, approximately 300 people fleeing from the concert venue entered the airfield after breaking down the <b>security</b> <b>fence</b> surrounding McCarran while seeking shelter from the gunfire. Since they had entered an active airfield, airport officials suspended operations on 01L/19R and 01R/19L at 10:15p.m. local time, and then shut down 08L/26R and 08R/26L one hour later. Airfield operations resumed at 12:40a.m. on October 2, and the <b>security</b> <b>fence</b> was repaired by 1:10a.m. During the suspension of operations, 25 flights were diverted to other airports in the region, primarily to Phoenix but also to Los Angeles, Ontario, Bullhead City, Salt Lake City, and Denver. Two bullets struck and damaged, but did not ignite, a large fuel tank {{on the grounds of the}} airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was also}} once popular with anglers (through the Cardiff Fly Fishing Club), picnickers, birdwatchers and walkers. Fishing at the reservoir stopped in 1998 {{and many of}} the other activities have been curtailed since 2004 due to the <b>security</b> <b>fence</b> that was constructed around the banks of the reservoir and (less securely) to the site boundary.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} a 1989 {{failure of the}} submarine cable and problems with the diesel generator, the light was converted to solar power with battery storage. The caretaker stayed in the premises until March 1991, when lease arrangement difficulties and the previous failure of the mains forced the caretaker's withdrawal. It only took until September 1991 for vandals to destroy the keepers' cottages by fire. In 1992 the Australian Construction Services cleared the site and stabilised some of the building elements, and a <b>security</b> <b>fence</b> was installed.|$|E

5|$|For twoyears {{after the}} bombing the only {{memorials}} to the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people at a <b>security</b> <b>fence</b> surrounding {{the site of the}} building. Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996, when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing. On July 1, 1997 the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15-member panel from 624submissions. The memorial was designed at a cost of $29million, which was raised by public and private funds. The memorial is part of the National Park Service and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg. It was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19, 2000, exactly five years {{after the bombing}}. Within the first year, it had 700,000visitors.|$|E
25|$|Also on June 24, activist Jaggi Singh, {{spokesperson}} for the group No One Is Illegal, suggested {{in a news conference}} that some protesters intended to attempt to breach the <b>security</b> <b>fence</b> in the coming days.|$|E

25|$|There was {{violence}} at the interface on Lanark Way, which separates the loyalist Shankill and republican Falls districts. Stones, bricks and bottles were hurled across the <b>security</b> <b>fence.</b> An Phoblacht reported that warning {{shots were fired}} from the nationalist side.|$|E
25|$|Another {{security}} measure {{is thought to}} have minimized damage; along the <b>security</b> <b>fence</b> were Jersey barriers, concrete barriers commonly used along roadways. These deflected the blast energy upward, and away from the lower floors of the building, perhaps even preventing a total collapse of the structure.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the BBC's Whistleblower {{programme}} revealed security failures at the airport, including faulty {{metal detectors}} {{and a lack}} of regular random baggage checks. Many of the claims made on the programme were later discredited and much of the camera work was found to be misleading (filming from a raised footpath was used to suggest there was no <b>security</b> <b>fence</b> on the southern perimeter of the site).|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{afterwards}} the Palestinian militant squad {{made their}} {{way back into the}} Gaza Strip, with Shalit, through the ground after they blew an opening in the <b>security</b> <b>fence</b> and disappeared. Meanwhile, large Israeli military forces arrived at the site and began helping the wounded. When they reached the tank the soldiers discovered the two bodies and a wounded crewman. When {{it became clear that the}} fourth crew member was missing, an abduction alert was declared, and various Israeli forces entered Gaza.|$|E
25|$|About 5:38am EST, while {{operating}} the motorcoach southbound in a left-hand HOV lane of I-75 in the Atlanta metropolitan area, the driver accidentally entered a left exit ramp, which ended abruptly at an elevated T-junction {{marked by a}} stop sign. When it {{reached the top of}} the ramp and the stop sign, the bus was traveling at highway speed. The driver lost control of the bus, which slid sideways into a concrete bridge wall and chain-link <b>security</b> <b>fence,</b> then fell 19 feet, landing on its left side across the interstate highway below. Twenty-nine passengers survived the crash, while seven occupants were killed.|$|E
25|$|Roughly {{half of the}} university's {{students}} {{volunteer in}} community-service programs in neighborhoods around campus and throughout Los Angeles. These outreach programs, as well as previous administrations' commitment to remaining in South Los Angeles amid widespread calls to move the campus following the 1965 Watts Riots, are credited {{for the safety of}} the university during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. (That the university emerged from the riots completely unscathed is all the more remarkable in light of the complete destruction of several strip malls in the area, including one just across Vermont Avenue from the campus's western <b>security</b> <b>fence.)</b> The ZIP code for USC is 90089 and the surrounding University Park community is 90007.|$|E

50|$|The {{site was}} patrolled by {{security}} following the explosion and was fenced off whilst demolition work was undertaken. Since demolition, the <b>security</b> <b>fences</b> have remained to prevent access onto the site.|$|R
5000|$|In both Newport and Cardiff, road {{closures}} and security measures, starting {{weeks in advance}} of the summit, created widespread disruption. Thirteen miles (21 km) of <b>security</b> <b>fencing,</b> 2.7 m high, was erected around the Newport hotel venue and ten miles of fencing put up around Cardiff city centre, creating what was described as a [...] "ring of steel". [...] Businesses in the vicinity of <b>security</b> <b>fencing</b> in Cardiff reported a drop in trade by up to a third. This fencing was based on, and expanded, the 'National Barrier Asset' which is held in reserve for similar events.|$|R
25|$|Eleven saboteurs, {{disguised}} {{in military}} uniforms, penetrated the <b>security</b> <b>fence</b> and infiltrated the A-7 parking ramp {{through a hole}} cut in the perimeter chain link fence. Investigators believe that some, if not all, arrived near the ramp in a boat surreptitiously guided along a nearby channel. The operation occurred during USAF security police (SP) shift changeover. Security was provided by both contracted civilian guards and operations and maintenance-funded, uniformed military, full-time and part-time Air National Guard Security Policemen. The perpetrators exited using the reverse of their entry method. Choosing to strike at shift change indicates the possibility of prior surveillance or insider information. The commandos placed approximately 25 explosive devices on the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after midnight, a 25-year-old woman {{suffered}} a fractured bone after being {{shot in the}} leg by a live round fired from New Barnsley RUC base. The base {{was the target of}} a gun and grenade attack. At the Larnak Way interface in West Belfast, loyalists tried to enter the nationalist area at 3am. A shot fired from the nationalist side struck a 14-year-old Protestant boy who was climbing over the <b>security</b> <b>fence.</b> It hit him in the shoulder and punctured a lung. One source reported that warning shots had been fired, while another said the teenager was wounded when an IRA unit launched a gun and grenade attack on a military base near the interface. Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) gunmen also opened fire on British soldiers in the Ardoyne area of North Belfast.|$|E
500|$|... 1995 saw the {{attendance}} rise drastically {{due to the}} <b>security</b> <b>fence</b> being breached on the Friday of the festival. Estimates suggest {{there may have been}} enough fence-jumpers to double the size of the festival. This aside, 1995 proved to be a highly successful year with memorable performances from Oasis, Elastica, Pulp, PJ Harvey, Jeff Buckley, Jamiroquai and The Cure. This was also {{the first year of the}} festival having a dance tent to cater for the rise in popularity of dance music, following the success of Orbital's headline appearance the previous year. The dance acts of 1995 were led by Massive Attack on the Friday and Carl Cox on the Saturday. The festival took a year off in 1996 to allow the land to recover and give the organisers a break. This would be a pattern which would be followed every five years until 2011, with the gap year moving to 2012. 1996 also saw the release of Glastonbury the Movie which was filmed at the 1993 and 1994 festivals.|$|E

500|$|Glastonbury 2007 (20–24 June) was headlined by Arctic Monkeys, The Killers, and The Who on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Dame Shirley Bassey {{was also}} featured. [...] In 2007, over 700 acts played on over 80 stages and the {{capacity}} expanded by 20,000 to 177,000. This was the first year that [...] "The Park" [...] area opened. Designed by Emily Eavis, its main stage featured extra sets by several artists playing on the main stages including Pete Doherty and Gruff Rhys, whilst the BBC launched their new [...] "Introducing" [...] stage in the area. The festival had the largest attendance since {{the construction of the}} <b>security</b> <b>fence,</b> and the largest legitimate attendance to date: ticket allocation was raised by 27,500 to 137,500, which were charged at £145 and sold out in 1 hour 45 minutes. [...] As an extra precaution against touts (scalpers), purchasers had to pre-register, including submission of a passport photo which was security printed into the ticket. Continued periods of rain throughout much of the festival caused muddy conditions, though without the flooding of 2005, in part due to the new £750,000 flood defences. However this constant rain made the general conditions within the site worse than 2 years before and more like the mud plains of 1998. It was difficult to find anywhere to sit down that had not turned to mud and key choke points, such as the thoroughfare at the front right of the Pyramid stage, turned into a quagmire. Muddy conditions on the temporary roads {{on the periphery of the}} site led to delays for people leaving the site. On 25 June, when the vast majority of festival goers were attempting to leave the festival, cars in the western car parks took over nine hours to exit the site. There was no stewarding provision in these areas, no information was disseminated regarding the delays, no organised marshalling of traffic was undertaken by the festival organisers, and no provision of drinking water was made to people stranded in their vehicles. Verbal and physical violence was witnessed between festival goers. When cars were finally allowed to leave the site the surrounding roads were found to be clear. Reported crime was down from 2005 but the number of arrests were [...] "well up", after a proactive operation of the police and security on site. There were 236 reported crimes, down from 267 in 2005; of these, 158 were drug related (183 in 2005). 1,200 people required medical aid with 32 hospitalised, most of which were accidents caused by the mud. There was one fatality: a West Midlands man found unconscious early on the Saturday morning died in Yeovil District Hospital of a suspected drugs overdose.|$|E
