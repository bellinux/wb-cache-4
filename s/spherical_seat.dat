40|$|This {{investigation}} {{analyzes the}} performance of a magnetic fluid based squeeze film for a sphere in a rough <b>spherical</b> <b>seat</b> with slip velocity. The slip model of Beavers and Joseph has been deployed to study the effect of velocity slip while the stochastic model of Christensen and Tonder has been used to calculate the effect of surface roughness. The concerned statistically averaged Reynolds’ type equation is solved to derive the pressure distribution which results in the calculation of load carrying capacity. The results presented in graphical forms confirm that the adverse effect of slip velocity can be overcome to a large extent at least in the case of negatively skewed roughness. However, lower values of slip may be preferred for enhancing the performance characteristics of the bearing system. Besides, variance (−ve) provides a little support to improve the performance characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 33 - 45 This paper reviews a long {{standing}} issue {{related to the}} stiffness and damping coefficients of tilting-pad (TP) bearings; namely, What {{is the nature of}} their frequency dependency? A research project was implemented at the Turbomachinery Laboratory (TL) at Texas A&M University (TAMU) around 2003 to examine the issue, applying procedures that had been developed and used to investigate the rotordynamic characteristics of annular gas seals. Those seals, using a smooth rotor and a honeycomb or hole-pattern stator were predicted to have strongly frequency-dependent reaction forces that could not be modeled by a combination of stiffness, damping, and inertia coefficients. Measurements confirmed the strongly frequency dependent nature of their stiffness and damping coefficients. Subsequent test have examined the following bearing types: (i) Two-axial-groove bearing, (ii) pressure dam bearings, (iii) Flexure-pivot-pad tilting-pad bearing (FPTP) in load-on-pad (LOP) and load-between-pad (LBP), (iv) Rocker-pivot-pad TP bearing in LOP and LBP configurations at two different preloads and 50 and 60 % offsets, and (v) a <b>spherical</b> <b>seat</b> bearing in LOP and LBP configurations. Representative test results are presented for some of these bearings. In addition, this paper includes experimental results for 5 -pad and 4 -pad tilting pad bearings (with similar features to TAMU configuration iv) tested at the GE Global Research Facility (GRC) as part of an independent research initiative from GE Oil and Gas. Frequency effects on the dynamic-stiffness coefficients were investigated by applying dynamic-force excitation over a range of excitation frequencies. Generally, for all bearings tested at TAMU and GRC, the direct real parts of the dynamic-stiffness coefficients could be modeled as quadratic functions of the excitation frequency and accounted for by adding a mass matrix to the conventional [C][K] model to produce a frequency-independent [M][C][K] model. Additionally, the direct damping could be modeled by a constant, frequency-independent coefficient. Consequently, these experimental findings from two independent sources support the use of synchronously reduced force coefficients for characterizing the dynamic performance of tilting pad bearings in Oil and Gas applications, as prescribed by API 617 7 th edition (Process Centrifugal Compressors) and more generally by API 684 Rotordynamic Tutorial...|$|E
40|$|On February 14, 1980, {{the solar}} maximum mission (SMM) {{satellite}} was launched into orbit with experiments to monitor solar activity. In {{order to obtain}} common object observations, experiments must be coaligned within 90 arc-seconds of the spacecraft pointing vector. Hardware designed to minimize structural and thermal distortions of the experiment support plate is described. Coalignment was provided through control of interface which combined flexible blades to limit load transfer and <b>spherical</b> <b>seats</b> for alignment reference...|$|R
50|$|Alignment of {{the test}} {{specimen}} in the testing machine is critical, because if the specimen is misaligned, either at an angle or offset to one side, the machine will exert a bending force on the specimen. This is especially bad for brittle materials, because it will dramatically skew the results. This situation can be minimized by using <b>spherical</b> <b>seats</b> or U-joints between the grips and the test machine. If the initial portion of the stress-strain curve is curved and not linear, it indicates the specimen is misaligned in the testing machine.|$|R
50|$|The jack is {{rigid and}} robust. The upright column is {{fabricated}} and welded to the cast steel Gear Box. The elevating screw {{is provided with}} buttress thread supported with single-acting thrust ball-bearing having a <b>spherical</b> <b>seating</b> {{at the top and}} self-aligning ball-bearing at the bottom. This imparts self-aligning properties to the screw under loaded condition. The elevating screw is under tension when loaded and hence there is no chance of distortion due to buckling.While lifting the load, the Jack rests firmly on its base. For movement from one place to another, the lifting carriage is to be lowered by pressing the yoke which lifts the base and the Jack rests on the three wheels with a ground clearance of 20 mm.|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} design of an all metal, fast response, bipropellant, shut-off valve {{for use on}} long duration space missions is reported. The valve provides the flow control capability for a 1, 000 lb thrust, bipropellant engine using oxygen difluoride and diborane as propellants. The shutoff seal selection is a soft-on-hard metal concept. The soft seal is a <b>spherical</b> shell that <b>seats</b> against a hard conical seat. Beryllium copper and beryllium nickel seals were selected to seal against an electrolyzed Inconel 718 seat. Poppet shaft sealing is achieved by use of hydroformed, Inconel 718 bellows. Two valve assemblies were fabricated and subjected {{to a series of}} tests including leak, response time, flow capacity, dry cycles, water cycles, liquid nitrogen cycles, liquid fluorine cycles, and lead-lag operation cycles. These tests demonstrated the ability of the valve to meet design goals...|$|R
