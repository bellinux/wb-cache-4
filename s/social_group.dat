Living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two, even after taking into account drug use, ethnic group, and size of <b>social</b> <b>group.</b> Other factors that play an important role include social isolation and immigration related to social adversity, racial discrimination, family dysfunction, unemployment, and poor housing conditions.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{river otter}} is more social than most mustelids. In all habitats, their basic <b>social</b> <b>group</b> is the family, {{consisting}} {{of an adult}} female and her progeny.

In coastal areas, males may remain gregarious even during the estrous period of females. Family groups may include helpers, which {{can be made up}} of unrelated adults, yearlings, or juveniles.|$|E
40|$|Because of politics, some {{economic}} policy reforms are adopted and pursued {{in the developing}} world, and others are delayed, and resisted. Economic reform is inherently a political act: It changes the distribution of benefits in society, benefiting some <b>social</b> <b>groups,</b> and hurting others. <b>Social</b> <b>groups</b> may oppose reform because of doubts about its benefits, or because they know it will harm their economic interests. The author shows how three types of reform - currency devaluation, the privatization of state enterprises, {{and the elimination of}} consumer (food) subsidies - affect the utility of nine different <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> (including international financial institutions). When governments try to privatize state-owned enterprises, for example, more <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> with greater political weight are likely to be disadvantaged than helped. Urban workers, urban bureaucrats, urban students, and the urban poor, are likely to"lose out"and will strongly oppose privatization. But the ruling elite, and urban politicians are also likely to at least partly resist privatization, fearing that such reform will reduce their economic"rents". More <b>social</b> <b>groups,</b> and power points thus oppose privatization than favor it, so this policy reform is likely to be delayed, or not implemented at all. However, <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> do not possess an absolute veto over economic reform, and policy reform can (and often does) occur, despite the opposition of certain <b>social</b> <b>groups.</b> It depends on the aggregate political weight of the groups opposing reform. For example, as the author shows, five <b>social</b> <b>groups,</b> either wholly or partly, oppose eliminating consumer (food) subsidies, but the combined weight of those groups is only roughly equal to the political weight of the four <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> - international financial institutions, the ruling elite, urban politicians, and urban capitalists - that favor this reform. Politically, consumer subsidies can be eliminated, or reduced, if the right kind of concern is shown for opposing <b>social</b> <b>groups.</b> Banks&Banking Reform,Economic Theory&Research,Environmental Economics&Policies,Payment Systems&Infrastructure,Social Inclusion&Institutions,Gender and Education,Economic Theory&Research,Banks&Banking Reform,Poverty Assessment,Inequality...|$|R

5|$|The boyars, {{members of}} the landed nobility, formed the most {{important}} <b>social</b> <b>group</b> in the principality. The {{vast majority of the}} population was formed by peasants who were called several names, such as vecini ("neighbors") or rumâni ("Romanians"), in medieval documents. In this period, animals, especially sheep, remained the main item of export, but from the Wallachian Plain great quantities of grain were transported to the Mediterranean area. The basis of the peasants' diet was formed by millet eaten as porridge, while the boyars also used wheat.|$|E
5|$|Vocal {{communication}} among variegated fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds in a <b>social</b> <b>group</b> and for advertising and defending a territory.

Birds maintain contact with each other by tsst or seeee calls, while a short, sharp tsit serves as an alarm call.|$|E
5|$|A young {{specimen}} of the Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus species (TMP 94.143.1) shows bite {{marks on the}} face that were inflicted by another tyrannosaur. The bite marks are healed over, indicating that the animal survived the bite. A full-grown Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus (TMP 85.62.1) also exhibits tyrannosaur bite marks, showing that attacks to the face were not limited to younger animals. While {{it is possible that}} the bites were attributable to other species, intraspecific aggression, including facial biting, is very common among predators. Facial bites are seen in other tyrannosaurs like Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, as well as in other theropod genera like Sinraptor and Saurornitholestes. Darren Tanke and Phil Currie hypothesize that the bites are due to intraspecific competition for territory or resources, or for dominance within a <b>social</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

5|$|As landholders and drafted {{government}} officials, the gentry {{considered themselves}} the leading members of society; gaining their cooperation and employment was {{essential for the}} county or provincial bureaucrat overburdened with official duties. In many ways, scholar-officials of the Song period differed from the more aristocratic scholar-officials of the Tang dynasty (618–907). Civil service examinations became the primary means of appointment to an official post as competitors vying for official degrees dramatically increased. Frequent disagreements amongst ministers of state on ideological and policy issues led to political strife {{and the rise of}} political factions. This undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which broke apart as a <b>social</b> <b>group</b> and gave way to a multitude of families which provided sons for civil service.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros {{grew up in}} a well-off {{ranching}} {{family from}} Los Indios, Texas, and was married to David Cisneros, a surgeon from Brownsville. They had five children. She was a well-respected volunteer in the local medical community, and was president of the southern chapter of the Cameron-Willacy Counties Medical Society. The association where she volunteered helped raise funds for medical scholarships. In addition, people close to Cisneros said she was a practicing Catholic and that she cared a lot for her family. She volunteered at St. Joe, and was well-liked in the <b>social</b> <b>group</b> she was part of. Since Los Indios was mostly a ranching community close to the U.S.-Mexico border, Cisneros's religiosity was heavily influenced by curanderismo, a practice of religious and folk medicine healing rooted in ancient Mexican culture.|$|E

In the spring of 1866, White and Catto established the Philadelphia Pythians, a baseball club composed mainly of men from the Knights of Pythias fraternal organization. Catto, a hard-hitting shortstop and second baseman, was the de facto captain on the field, while White became the team's secretary, responsible for scheduling games, arranging festivities, and recording statistics.

In 1784, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, an active socialite, demanded that people boycott Covent Garden as its residents had voted against Whig member of parliament Charles James Fox. This had caused him to lose his seat in parliament, leading to {{the dissolution of the}} Fox–North Coalition. She insisted people should look for nearer shopping streets, and encouraged people to go to Bond Street. Consequently, the street became a retail area for people living in Mayfair.

He soon discovered the cruising scene in Pershing Square, where he met Champ Simmons, {{a man who had been}} a lover of one of Gerber's Society compatriots. This man told Hay about the Society's brief history, warning Hay of the futility of trying to organize gay men. Although Hay would later deny that he had any knowledge of previous LGBT activism, he was inspired by this knowledge to conceive in 1948 a proposal for a gay men's political and <b>social</b> <b>group.</b> In 1950 Hay's idea reached fruition when he and several other men founded the Mattachine Society, the first enduring LGBT rights organization in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Sonderweg {{hypothesis}} attributed Germany's difficult 20th {{century to}} the weak political, legal, and economic basis of the new empire. The Prussian landed elites, the Junkers, retained a substantial share of political power in the unified state. The Sonderweg hypothesis attributed their power {{to the absence of}} a revolutionary breakthrough by the middle classes, or by peasants in combination with the urban workers, in 1848 and again in 1871. Recent research into the role of the Grand Bourgeoisie—which included bankers, merchants, industrialists, and entrepreneurs—in the construction of the new state has largely refuted the claim of political and economic dominance of the Junkers as a <b>social</b> <b>group.</b> This newer scholarship has demonstrated the importance of the merchant classes of the Hanseatic cities and the industrial leadership (the latter particularly important in the Rhineland) in the ongoing development of the Second Empire.|$|E
40|$|Four studies {{examined}} how mental abstraction affects how people perceive {{their relationships with}} other people, specifically, how these relationships may be categorized in <b>social</b> <b>groups.</b> We expected that individuals induced to think abstractly would report fewer more global <b>social</b> <b>groups,</b> compared to those induced to think concretely, who would report more specific groups. However, induced abstract mindset did not affect how people structured their <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> (Study 2 - 4), despite evidence that the mindset manipulation changed the level of abstraction in their thoughts (Study 3) and evidence that it changed how people structured groups for a control condition (household objects, Study 4). Together, these studies suggest that while the way people organize their relationships into groups is malleable; cognitive abstraction {{does not seem to}} affect how people categorize their relationships into <b>social</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
40|$|Traditionally neuropsychological {{observations}} have constrained {{the view}} that semantic knowledge is organized in categories: animals, plants or tools (Warrington & Shallice, 1984; Caramazza & Shelton, 1998; Tyler & Moss, 2001). Recently it has suggested that <b>social</b> <b>groups,</b> defined as categories of individuals that share category-relevant characteristics and/or features (Mason & Macrae, 2004),could have a representation of their own. Rumiati et al. (2014) documented double dissociations on word sorting tasks between living things, non-living things and <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> in patients with primary dementia. Consistently with this neuropsychological finding, a neuroimaging study showed that, relatively to non-social concepts, concepts about <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> activated the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and the temporo-parietal junction (Contreras et al., 2012). In the present study we tested whether <b>social</b> <b>groups,</b> such as “Muslims” or “fat people”, are represented independently of the other concepts and, if so, what are their brain correlates. Twenty-nine patients with temporal and frontal brain tumors, either in {{the left or right}} hemisphere, and 19 healthy controls matched for age and education (all p>. 05) were tested on three tasks (picture naming, word-to-picture-matching, and picture sorting) using stimuli that belonged to three categories: living things (animals and plants, N= 15), non-living things (artifacts, N= 15) and <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> (N= 15). The stimuli belonging to the three categories were matched for letter length and frequency (all p>. 05). Results showed that left-brain tumor patients (lBTP) were found to be worse than both healthy controls (HC) and right-brain tumor patients (rBTP) on naming non-living things (p<. 05) and <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> (p<. 01). lBTP performed significantly worse on naming non-living things than living things and <b>social</b> <b>groups,</b> while rBTP performed as well as healthy controls. Moreover lBTP made significantly more semantic errors and circumlocutions only with <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> category than rBTP who, in turn, made more visual errors. All the patients performed at ceiling level on both the word-to-picture-matching and picture sorting tasks. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) revealed that lesions involving the left inferior frontal gyrus led to a selective impairment in naming living things, lesions of the inferior temporal cortex led to a selective impairment in naming non-living things, and lesions of the area between the left inferior and middle frontal gyri led to a selective deficit in naming <b>social</b> <b>groups.</b> Thus the lesion analysis confirms that the <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> are represented independently of other concepts. Moreover, the brain regions, that when damaged give rise to a deficit in naming <b>social</b> <b>groups,</b> are comparable to those found activated in imaging findings dealing with social stereotypes...|$|R
