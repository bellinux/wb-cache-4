On the contrary, the army had {{to reduce the number}} of vehicles according to the Moscow Armistice. The frustrated component suppliers left the business and the Ministry of Trade and Industry terminated the vehicle <b>supply</b> <b>contract</b> from the end of 1946. In early 1946, Yhteissisu had agreed with the Ministry of Trade and Industry that vehicles not bought by the state could be sold on the civilian market.

The cutting and polishing of rough diamonds is a specialized skill that is concentrated in {{a limited number of}} locations worldwide. Traditional diamond cutting centers are Antwerp, Amsterdam, Johannesburg, New York City, and Tel Aviv. Recently, diamond cutting centers have been established in China, India, Thailand, Namibia and Botswana. Cutting centers with lower cost of labor, notably Surat in Gujarat, India, handle a larger number of smaller carat diamonds, while smaller quantities of larger or more valuable diamonds {{are more likely to be}} handled in Europe or North America. The recent expansion of this industry in India, employing low cost labor, has allowed smaller diamonds to be prepared as gems in greater quantities than was previously economically feasible.|$|E

40|$|Artículos en revistasCombined cycle {{gas turbine}} (CCGT) plants show some advantages, such as better economies of scale, or lower CO 2 {{emission}} rates, {{in comparison to}} other technologies. In addition, due to their flexible operation, CCGT plants are a useful support for {{the integration of the}} growing renewable energy installed capacity. Consequently, during the last years, CCGT plants have proliferated in electricity systems, increasing the global demand of natural gas (NG). In order to guarantee the NG supply and to hedge the price volatility, electricity generation companies (Gencos) sign <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> with NG producers. Typically, NG producers force long-term contracts in order to recover their huge capital investments. Therefore, Gencos should optimize the exercise of the <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> in the long-term scope in order to maximize their profits in the electricity market. However, the optimal exercise of the <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> on behalf of the Gencos could be impeded because of possible bottlenecks in the NG system. Accordingly, this paper proposes a methodology to incorporate both the characteristics of NG <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> and the congestions in the NG system in an electricity market model that could support the decision-making process on behalf of the Gencos. A study case illustrates the methodology. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
25|$|On December 19, Gazprom {{released}} {{a statement saying that}} no <b>supply</b> <b>contract</b> could be signed for 2009 because Ukraine said it would not make any more payments in 2008. This was denied by a Naftogaz spokesman. On the same day, Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko's spokesman on international energy security stated that Ukraine had paid for its October and September supplies, and that although it still had to pay for November's supply before the end of 2008, no other payments would be due until the end of January. On December 23, President Yushchenko said that part of the debt was restructured for January – February 2009, but Gazprom denied that there was any such agreement and said that it remained committed to cut supplies to Ukraine on January 1 if Ukraine did not pay its remaining $1.67billion debt for gas supplies and an additional $450million in fines.|$|E
500|$|There {{remained}} {{the issue of}} cooperation between the Manhattan's Project's Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Montreal Laboratory. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 17 February 1944, Chadwick pressed for resources {{to build a nuclear}} reactor at what is now known as the Chalk River Laboratories. Britain and Canada agreed to pay the cost of this project, but the United States had to supply the heavy water. At that time, the United States controlled, by a <b>supply</b> <b>contract,</b> the only major production site on the continent, that of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company at Trail, British Columbia. Given that it was unlikely to have any impact on the war, Conant in particular was cool about the proposal, but heavy water reactors were of great interest. Groves was willing to support the effort and supply the heavy water required, but with certain restrictions. The Montreal Laboratory would have access to data from the research reactors at Argonne and the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, but not from the production reactors at the Hanford Site; nor would they be given any information about plutonium. This arrangement was formally approved by the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 19 September 1944. The Canadian ZEEP (Zero Energy Experimental Pile) reactor [...] went critical on 5 September 1945.|$|E

With regard to the technology to transform the input produced by the supplier, as an entrant becomes increasingly efficient, its input demand can decrease, and thus, the supplier earns smaller profits when socially efficient entry is allowed.

40|$|This article investigates {{downstream}} firms’ {{ability to}} collude in a repeated game of competition between supply chains.

Banning information exchange about wholesale prices decreases the scope for collusion. Moreover, high downstream prices {{are more difficult to}} sustain if upstream rather than downstream firms make contract offers...|$|R

The dispute began in 2008 {{with a series}} of failed negotiations, and on January 1 Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine. On January 7 the dispute turned to crisis when all Russian gas flows through Ukraine were halted for 13 days, completely cutting off supplies to Southeastern Europe, most of which depends on Russian gas, and partially to other European countries.|$|E

40|$|A {{common theme}} in the studies of {{flexible}} <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> has been the producer's profit-maximization problem {{without regard to the}} suppliers' reactions. However, suppliers do react and protect their downside against producer's operating policies by revising their strategies {{in a manner consistent with}} their profitmaximization objectives. This fact motivates our work. Using a real-options (contingent claims) approach, we analyze and value <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> in a setting characterized by exchange rate uncertainty, supplier-switching options, order-quantity flexibility, profit sharing, and supplier reaction options. We also use basic diversification concepts, from portfolio theory, to analyze risk reduction in a unique framework. Given this setup, we explicitly model how flexibility can be mutually beneficial to both the producer and the suppliers. Using this model, we concurrently solve and examine the dual optimization problem for the suppliers and the producer. Our approach also endogenizes the extent and degree of profit sharing through the resulting optimal policies. We also analyze what induces the producer and the suppliers to accept flexibility in their <b>contracts.</b> valuation, <b>supply</b> <b>contracts,</b> real options, reaction options, stochastic dynamic programming...|$|R
