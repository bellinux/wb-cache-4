25|$|It {{was in the}} {{capacity}} of War Minister that Boulanger gained most popularity. He introduced reforms {{for the benefit of}} soldiers (such as allowing soldiers to grow beards) and appealed to the French desire for revenge against Imperial Germany—in doing <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to be regarded as the man destined to serve that revenge (nicknamed Général Revanche). He also managed to quell the major workers' strike in Decazeville. A minor scandal arose when Philippe, comte de Paris, the nominal inheritor of the French throne in the eyes of Orléanist monarchists, married his daughter Amélie to Portugal's Carlos I, in a lavish wedding that provoked fears of anti-Republican ambitions. The French Parliament hastily passed a law expelling all possible claimants to the crown from French territories. Boulanger communicated to d'Aumale his expulsion from the armed forces. He received the adulation of the public and the press after the Sino-French War, when France's victory added Tonkin to its colonial empire. He also vigorously pressed for the accelerated adoption, in 1886, of the new and technically revolutionary Lebel rifle which introduced for the first time smokeless powder high-velocity ammunition.|$|E

"Shape" [...] {{was written}} by Sting, Dominic Miller and Craig Dodds, and {{produced}} by Dodds under his production name Craigie, for the Sugababes' second studio album, Angels with Dirty Faces (2002). It is a remake of Sting's 1993 recording [...] "Shape of My Heart"; the song's verses were changed, while the chorus that features Sting's vocals was re-recorded. According to Sugababes member Mutya Buena, [...] "He felt he could do better with the chorus, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> in to re-record it". The song was engineered by Jack Guy, and programmed by Dean Barratt. Additional vocal recording was completed by Ben Georgiades. [...] "Shape" [...] is the album's fourth and final single, and was released in the United Kingdom on 10 March 2003 as a CD single and cassette tape. The B-side is a cover version of English producer Adamski's and English musician Seal's 1990 single [...] "Killer".|$|E
500|$|Scott Miller was {{a lifelong}} gamer who {{released}} his text-based video games as shareware in the 1980s. By 1988, the shareware business was a $10 to $20 {{million a year}} market, but the distribution method had never been tried for video games. Miller found that gamers were not {{willing to pay for}} something they could get for free, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> {{up with the idea of}} offering only the opening levels of his games; players could purchase the game to receive the rest of the game. George Broussard, whom Miller met while he was in high school, joined Miller at his company, Apogee, which published and marketed games developed by other companies. While Miller was quiet, with a head for business, Broussard was an enthusiastic [...] "creative impresario". Apogee (from which a new brand name was made in 1994, 3D Realms) grew from a small startup to a successful corporation. Among the titles they published was id Software's Commander Keen in 1990 and Wolfenstein 3D in 1992. Commander Keen met great success, leading to the development of many sidescrollers for the DOS platform, including many developed by Apogee and using the same engine that powered the Keen games, and Wolfenstein was highly successful, popularizing 3D gaming and establishing the first-person shooter (FPS) genre.|$|E
500|$|Using Bern public library, Lenin devoted {{much time}} to reading the works of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach, and Aristotle, {{all of whom had}} been key {{influences}} on Marx's thought. In doing <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to reject his earlier interpretations of Marxism; whereas he had once believed that policies could be developed on the basis of predetermined scientific principles, he now believed that the only test of whether a practice was right or not was through practice. Although still perceiving himself as an orthodox Marxist, he began to divert from some of Marx's predictions regarding societal development; whereas Marx had believed that a [...] "bourgeoisie-democratic revolution" [...] of the middle-classes had to take place before a [...] "socialist revolution" [...] of the proletariat, Lenin believed that in Russia, the proletariat could overthrow the Tsarist regime without the intermediate revolution. In Switzerland, Lenin revived the Bolshevik magazine Social-Democrat with Grigory Zinoviev in November 1914. Contact with the Bolsheviks in Russia was sparse due to the war, while the Okhrana had intensified their suppression of Bolsheviks in the Empire. In July 1916, Lenin's mother died, although he was unable to attend her funeral in St. Petersburg due to the war. Her death deeply affected him, and he became depressed, fearing that he would not live long enough to witness the socialist revolution to which he had devoted his life.|$|E

500|$|... "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?" [...] emulates {{the style}} of Ben Folds. According to music critic Nathan Rabin, the song [...] "amplifies the noxious {{self-absorption}} of the American character to hilarious extremes" [...] by describing a narrator who, upon hearing {{about a number of}} horrible tragedies, only complains about the (minor) inconveniences that affect him. [...] Folds himself plays piano on the track. Yankovic later told The A.V. Club: [...] "Ben and I are old friends at this point, and of course I sought his keyboard work for that song. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> in and knocked it out. I think that’s an F-Sharp, so he was kind of mad at me for that." [...] "Bob" [...] is a style parody of Bob Dylan, composed entirely of palindromes (for instance, the song's first line is [...] "I, man, am regal—a German am I", which reads the same when reversed). Rabin argues that the song's lyrics [...] "sound cryptic enough to be genuine Dylanesque, but are in fact palindromes deliver in an uncanny re-creation of Dylan's nasal whine." [...] The album's closer, [...] "Genius in France", emulates the idiosyncratic style of Frank Zappa. Zappa's son, Dweezil performed the song's intro guitar solo. Lyrically, the song describes a person who, although rejected elsewhere, finds acceptance in France.|$|E

2500|$|As {{it turned}} out, the de Medici {{libretto}} {{was rejected by}} the Teatro Argentina and I due Foscari was substituted. This gave Verdi the opportunity to re-read Byron's play and, in doing <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to the realization (which he expressed in a letter to Piave) that the librettist had better NOT 'stick close to Byron': [...] "...the play does not quite have the theatrical grandeur needed for an opera; so rack your brains and try to find something which will make a bit of a splash particularly in the first act" [...] and he continues by stressing that [...] "it's a fine subject, delicate and full of pathos"." [...] Thus, the rather lower key of the original piece stood out in direct contrast to the opera by which it was succeeded. However, as musicologist Roger Parker notes, it appears that Verdi was [...] "concentrating on personal confrontations rather than grand scenic effects".|$|E
2500|$|Cranton is {{interviewed by}} Wimsey and his brother-in-law, Detective Inspector Charles Parker. Much becomes clear when Cranton {{confirms}} that [...] "Cobbleigh" [...] was actually Deacon, the thieving butler. In 1918 he murdered a warder and escaped from prison. A body, apparently his, was later found, {{but in fact}} Deacon had murdered a soldier (Cobbleigh) and swapped identities with him. He married bigamously in France and waited several years to return for the emeralds, which he had hidden before his arrest. Since he risked hanging if caught, he finally asked Cranton to help, sending him the cipher as {{a clue to the}} hiding place as a token of good faith. Cranton could not solve it but knew it related to the bells, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to Fenchurch as [...] "Driver" [...] on New Year's Day (when Wimsey encountered him).

Zhang Yu accompanied Liu Zhang when he met Liu Bei for a reception banquet in Fu County (涪縣; present-day Mianyang, Sichuan). During the banquet, Liu Bei saw that Zhang Yu had a thick beard, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> up with a joke {{to make fun of}} Zhang Yu: [...] "When I was in Zhuo County (涿縣), there were many people with the family name Mao. They were everywhere, be it north, south, east or west. The Prefect even remarked, 'Zhuo County is surrounded by Maos!'" [...] Zhang Yu also cracked a joke to get back at Liu Bei: [...] "Once upon a time, there was a certain Prefect of Lu County (潞縣) who was later reassigned to Zhuo County. After he retired, someone wanted to write him a letter but didn't know how to address him in a way that reflected the two appointments he held, so he thought of the term 'Gentleman of Lu-Zhuo' (潞涿君)." [...] Zhang Yu's joke was meant to mock Liu Bei, who had no beard.|$|E

2500|$|On April 5, 1995, at UFC 5, Shamrock got his rematch with Gracie in a match called [...] "The Superfight," [...] {{which would}} {{determine}} the UFC Champion. At the time, Gracie {{had a reputation}} as being seemingly unbeatable. Gracie had obvious concerns about his relative lack of size in comparison to Shamrock, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> into the octagon at 190 pounds – roughly fifteen pounds above what had been his normal fighting weight; Shamrock also cut his weight down to 205 pounds for the bout. Hours before the event, the UFC suddenly instituted a 30-minute time limit, mainly due to pay per view time constraints. Both Gracie and Shamrock were upset at the sudden rule change. For Shamrock, it ruined his game plan, who had been training for months to utilize his natural advantages in size and strength to wear Gracie down over the course of two hours. Shamrock and Gracie fought for the entire allotted time of 30 minutes along with 5 minutes of overtime before the match was declared a draw due to the fight not having judges. Had there been ringside judges, UFC matchmaker Art Davie believes that Shamrock would have been declared the winner. Gracie left with a melon sized welt closing his eye, a result of a standing punch due to a sudden change of the rules in which both of the fighters were restarted on their feet. Shamrock was not satisfied with his performance against Gracie, saying [...] "it's certainly not a win. You gain nothing (with a draw)". Shamrock expressed desire to fight Gracie again for a third time in 1996, saying that if it went to a draw again, he would have Gracie declared the winner and Shamrock would forfeit his UFC Superfight Championship belt to Gracie. Gracie left the UFC after his fight with Shamrock and did not return until 11 years later.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the generic}} alien concept was finalized, {{each of the}} effects coordinators worked with a {{specific}} actor. Mahan chose to work with Mandy Patinkin, as well as Francisco's son. Rosengrant worked with Leslie Bevis who played Cassandra. Woodruff worked on Terence Stamp who played the part of Harcourt. In trying to emphasize {{the uniqueness of the}} [...] characters, Mahan commented, [...] "We wanted the audience to be able to recognize the actors immediately. They were all so good, {{it would have been a}} shame to cover them up completely." [...] Other effects coordinators like Gillis remarked, [...] "The actor who played Trent Porter, for example–Brian Thompson–was a really rugged guy, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> off looking like a really tough character. On the other hand, Kevyn Major Howard–who played Harcourt's murderous henchman–had very delicate, boyish kind of features, so we used that quality to create a creepy juxtaposition." [...] While effects coordinators were struggling to finish the final design and full-scale production of the alien prosthetics, Hurd chose makeup artist Zoltan Elek to supervise the overall application. Elek had previously worked on the film Mask and the character Max Headroom. Elek insisted that the alien coloration be much more closer to human skin tones rather than the originally chosen yellowish pigment. Elek recalled his disagreement with Winston as Stan felt, [...] "... the aliens should be a totally different color than the humans, with a lot of yellows, blues and grays. To me, that scheme was too monstrous–in fact, we ended up using it on the Harcourt monster at the climax." [...] Another creative aspect of the makeup was the gradation between the principal and background masks. The crew of Alien Nation sought to avoid the same mistakes made in Planet of the Apes twenty years earlier. As explained by Gillis, [...] "We had what we referred to as 'A-B-C-D' makeups, ... The 'A' makeups were those custom designed for the principal actors, while the 'B' makeups were mix-and-match where we would recombine pieces from other actors to create a new character. Our 'D' masks–the ones furthest from camera–were overhead slip latex masks incapable of changing expression. The 'C' masks, however, were made of foam latex and could be glued down to get some expression from the characters in the middleground." [...] Application of the Newcomer makeup known as [...] "spuds" [...] or [...] "potatoheads" [...] on set, required four hours; a task which Patinkin described as being [...] "a pain in the ass." [...] Masks were manufactured in a production line to meet the enormous demand for the film. Mahan mused, [...] "We would pull the pieces out of the oven, fix them up, paint them and have them ready for pickup that afternoon to be taken to the set. The pieces were barely cold when Zoltan and his crew applied them." ...|$|E
