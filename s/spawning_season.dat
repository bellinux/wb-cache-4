Size at maturity for females were 11.4 cm in India, 11.6 cm in Turkey and 12.2 cm in Tunisia.|$|R
40|$|The {{toxicological}} {{profiles of}} two local common puffer fish, Takifugu niphobles (Jordan and Snyder) and Takifugu alboplumbeus (Richardson), collected in Hong Kong waters were investigated continuously for 14 months (June 1997 –August 1998). Their annual <b>spawning</b> <b>seasons</b> (as evident by the enlargement of gonads and presence of {{eggs in the}} ovary) {{were found to be}} from October to February (four consecutive months) and December to February (two consecutive months), respectively. The toxicities of their internal organs were determined by standard mouse bioassay and expressed in terms of mouse units (MU). The ovary (in both species) and liver (only in T. niphobles) were discovered to be moderately toxic (100 – 1000 MU/g) in their non-spawning seasons. Whilst all the intestine and skin were weakly toxic (between 10 and 100 MU/g), their flesh, however, was basically non-toxic (less than 10 MU/g) throughout the whole year. The testes, which were only developed in their <b>spawning</b> <b>seasons,</b> were also non-toxic. This study showed that the toxicological profiles of both of the two species had prominent seasonal patterns which were highly related to their <b>spawning</b> <b>seasons.</b> Contrary to the most common belief, both species were discovered to be relatively less toxic during their <b>spawning</b> <b>seasons.</b> Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|R

5|$|As {{with many}} species of fish, the timing of {{spawning}} varies over {{the range of the}} species, with gonad development indicating that spawning in the southern New South Wales region occurs from December to April, while spawning in southern Queensland occurs from September to February. Spawning takes place twice a year, evident by the two classes of egg size found in the ovaries and by the two recruitment pulses observed each year as young fish enter their juvenile habitats. The spawning takes place at the mouths of estuaries or in surf zones, with the larvae occurring in fully marine waters. Juveniles reach 16.5cm in length after their first year of life, 26.7cm after their second year and 30.5cm after their third year. After the beginning of the <b>spawning</b> <b>season</b> young whiting of 10mm and over can be observed swimming actively in small droves of from 10 to 20 on the sand flats and beaches to which they are recruited, moving up and down with the tide, swimming in very shallow water to depths of 1m. Unlike closely related sillaginids, the juveniles usually prefer unprotected sand substrates, while other species tend to use seagrass and mangroves as protection. As they grow older they keep further from the shore.|$|E
25|$|In the , the roe of {{this species}} is called buriko. The fish is caught during its <b>spawning</b> <b>season,</b> when many of the females are loaded with eggs 23mm in diameter. The eggs are {{surrounded}} by slimy mucous.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} a common belief that all puffer fishes are more toxic in their <b>spawning</b> <b>seasons,</b> perhaps to protect their fertilized eggs. However, the current study of two puffer fishes, Takifugu niphobles (Jordan and Snyder) and Takifugu alboplumbeus (Richardson), {{collected}} in Hong Kong waters continuously {{for over a year}} and bioassayed for toxicity in terms of mouse units (MU), showed the contrary. Their annual <b>spawning</b> <b>seasons</b> (evident from the enlargement of the gonads and the presence of eggs in the ovary) were found to be from October to February (4 consecutive months) and December to February (2 consecutive months), respectively. In both species, the ovaries were highly toxic (100 - 1, 000 MU/g) only in their non-spawning seasons and they became weakly toxic (10 - 100 MU/g) in their spawning seasons; unlike the ovaries, liver and intestine, the flesh and the skin did not have marked annual toxicity patterns. Their flesh was basically non-toxic (less than 10 MU/g) throughout the whole year. The testes, which were only developed in the <b>spawning</b> <b>seasons,</b> were also found to be non-toxic.

25|$|The {{blue runner}} reaches sexual {{maturity}} at slightly different lengths throughout its range, with all such studies {{occurring in the}} west Atlantic. Research in northwest Florida found a length at maturity of 267mm, a study in Louisiana showed the species reaches sexual maturity at 247–267mm in females and 225mm in males, and in Jamaica lengths of 260mm for males and 280 for females were estimated. Spawning appears to occur offshore year round, although several peaks in spawning activity {{have been found in}} different areas through the species range. Peak <b>spawning</b> <b>season</b> in the Gulf of Mexico occurs from June to August, with a secondary peak in spawning during October in northwest Florida. Elsewhere, peaks in larval abundance indicate spawning in the warmer summer months between January and August. Each female releases between 41,000 and 1,546,000 eggs on average, with larger fish producing more eggs. Both the eggs and larvae are pelagic.|$|E
25|$|Round gobies are small, soft-bodied fish, {{characterized}} by a distinctive black spot on the first dorsal fin. Their eyes are large and protrude slightly {{from the top of}} the head and, like most gobies, round gobies have pelvic fins that are fused to form a single disc on the belly of the fish shaped like a suction cup. Round gobies range in length from 4 to 10nbsp&inches (maximum of 9.7nbsp&inches (24.6nbsp&cm)), and in weight from 0.176 ounces to 2.816 ounces, increasing as they age. Male round gobies are larger than females. Juvenile round gobies (less than one year old) are grey. Upon maturation, round gobies become mottled with gray, black, brown, and olive green markings. Adult male round gobies turn inky black during the <b>spawning</b> <b>season</b> and develop swollen cheeks. Male and female round gobies are easily differentiated through the shape of their urogenital papilla, which is white to grey, long and pointed in males, and brown, short and blunt-tipped in females.|$|E
25|$|The Sillaginidae are an oviparous, non {{guarding}} family, whose species tend to show similar reproductive {{patterns to}} one another. Each species reaches sexual maturity at {{a slightly different}} age, with each sex often showing a disparity in time of maturation. Each species also spawns over a different season and the <b>spawning</b> <b>season</b> often differs within a species, usually {{as a function of}} latitude; a feature not unique to sillaginids. The proximity to shore of spawning is also different between species, as each species usually does not migrate inshore to spawn, even if the juveniles require shallow water for protection, instead relying on currents. The fecundity of sillaginids is variable, with a normal range between 50 000 – 100 000. The eggs are small (0.6 to 0.8mm), spherical and pelagic, hatching around 20 days after fertilisation. The larvae are quite similar, requiring a trained developmental biologist to identify between species. The larvae and juveniles are {{at the mercy of the}} ocean currents, being too weaker swimmers to actively seek out coastlines. Currents are thought to have been responsible for the distribution of mainland species to offshore islands as well as the current widespread distribution of Sillago sihama. In all studied species, juveniles inhabit shallow waters in protected embayments, estuaries, tidal creeks and lagoons as well as exposed surf zones, usually over tidal flats and seagrass beds. As the fish mature, they generally move to deeper waters, showing a change in diet.|$|E

25|$|Asian {{black bears}} are omnivorous, and will feed on insects, beetle larvae, invertebrates, termites, grubs, carrion, bees, eggs, garbage, mushrooms, grasses, fruits, nuts, seeds, honey, herbs, acorns, cherries, dogwood, and grain. Though herbivorous {{to a greater}} degree than brown bears, and more {{carnivorous}} than American black bears, Asian black bears are not as specialised in their diet as pandas are: while pandas depend on a constant supply of low calorie, yet abundant foodstuffs, black bears are more opportunistic and have opted for a nutritional boom-or-bust economy. They thus gorge themselves on a variety of seasonal high calorie foods, storing the excess calories as fat, and then hibernate during times of scarcity. Black bears will eat pine nuts and acorns of the previous year in the April–May period. In times of scarcity, they enter river valleys to gain access to hazelnuts and insect larvae in rotting logs. From mid-May through late June, they will supplement their diet with green vegetation and fruit. Through July to September, they will climb trees to eat bird cherries, pine cones, vines and grapes. On rare occasions they will eat dead fish during the <b>spawning</b> <b>season,</b> though this constitutes a much lesser portion of their diet than in brown bears. In the 1970s, black bears were reported to kill and eat Hanuman langurs in Nepal. They appear to be more carnivorous than most other bears, including American black bears, and will kill ungulates with some regularity, including domestic livestock. Wild ungulate prey can include muntjacs, serow, takin, wild boar and adult water buffaloes, which they kill by breaking their necks.|$|E
