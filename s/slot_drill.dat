40|$|A compact {{wideband}} rectangular dielectric resonator antenna (RDRA) is {{investigated and}} presented. Perforations improve bandwidth by lowering down the quality factor. The perforations are {{an array of}} symmetrical square-shaped <b>slots</b> <b>drilled</b> uniformly on the RDRA.

40|$|Abstractâ€”In this paper, {{extending}} the design technique {{presented by the}} authors in a previous work, we propose the study of a new family of polygonal patch antennas for portable devices of communication systems. Such antennas are suitable to be mounted in modern terminals, enabling wideband/multi-frequency operation and new multimedia features. The desired electromagnetic behaviour of the proposed radiators is obtained by adding either shorting posts, properly located between the polygonal patch and the ground plane, or circular <b>slots,</b> <b>drilled</b> at the appropriate position on the patch surface. Circular slots are also useful to easily accommodate a photo-camera in the terminal, in order to enable multimedia services and video calls. Some practical layouts of polygonal patch antennas to be used in: a) modern PDAs and Smart Phones integrating cellular phone operation and wireless functionalities; b) UMTS terminals integrating also GSM functionalities, are, finally, presented. The effectiveness of the proposed designs is confirmed through proper full-wave numerical simulations. 1...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that the use of a {{waterjet}} slot to create a free surface in a rock face will allow subsequent excavation of large fragments of rock, weighing up to 2000 lb.

Modern motorcycle discs tend to have a floating design whereby the disc [...] "floats" [...] on bobbins and can move slightly, allowing better disc centering with a fixed caliper. A floating disc also avoids disc warping and reduces heat transfer to the wheel hub. Calipers have evolved from simple single-piston units to two-, four- and even six-piston items. Compared to cars, motorcycles have a higher center of mass:wheelbase ratio, so they experience more weight transfer when braking. Front brakes absorb most of the braking forces, while the rear brake serves mainly to balance the motorcycle during braking. Modern sport bikes typically have twin large front discs, with a much smaller single rear disc. Bikes that are particularly fast or heavy may have vented discs.|$|R

To overcome the disadvantages of existing techniques in terms of cost and flexibility, a new approach has been taken to provide a tool for rapid prototyping and small-scale production: Complex CAD/CAM software has been developed that automatically generates the tool paths according to a CAD drawing of the MEMS device. As laser ablation is a much more complicated process than mechanical machining, for which such software has already been in use for many years, the generation of these tool paths relies not only on geometric considerations, but also on a sophisticated simulation module taking into account various material and laser parameters and micro-effects. The following laser machining options have been implemented: cutting, hole <b>drilling,</b> <b>slot</b> cutting, 2 D area clearing, pocketing and 2 D surface machining.

Generation of ultrasound using EMATs is relatively inefficient, however, the amplitude of the signal at a defect can be greatly improved with the use of focusing.

40|$|Orthopaedic {{surgeons}} can be {{assisted by}} Patient Specific Surgical Guides (PSSGs) during {{the determination of}} prosthesesâ€™ alignment in joint replacement surgeries. These guides are designed preoperatively â€“ using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computer Tomography (CT) â€“ to have a matching contact surface with the patientâ€™s bone. This enables the surgeon to place the guide in a uniquely planned position intraoperatively. Saw <b>slots</b> and <b>drill</b> holes are incorporated in PSSGs to create the crucial saw planes and drill holes for prostheses positioning. Tissues not detected by MRI or CT cannot be accounted for {{in the design of}} the guideâ€™s matching surface. When such undetected tissues are present at the bone contact, they can introduce a positional error of the surgical guide. In our study multiple concepts are created which possibly decrease the positional error. The choice is made to develop a rigid and a compliant pin-based guide. Pin-based guides are configurable and thus suitable for multiple patients, since a patient-specific fit can be created. When relatively much contact points are used for the fit, compliant pins are able to absorb local irregularities. Therefore, a compliant guide can result in a lower positional error when a contact is placed onto an undetected tissue. Using more contact points will increase the ability of a compliant guide to result in a lower positional error. The two guide types are compared to their sensitivity to bony deviations in an experimental validation. The guides are placed onto a printed distal femur bone model with bony deviations. The actually reached position is measured using the optical tracking system Qualisys and is compared to the obtained position without bony deviations. For each guide four contact sets are tested to investigate the effect of the number of contact points. For validation of the experimental data, the positional error is calculated for the rigid guide with six contact points using an analytical model. Analysis of the measurement data results in a significantly lower rotational error for compliant guides compared to rigid guides. No significance is found between the translations of the two guide types. Further development of the compliant guide can be considered, since a significantly lower rotational error is obtained.

40|$|On the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) today, {{there are}} 1033 subsea wells that are {{classified}} {{with the status}} online/operational, Drilling, Predrilled, Suspended and Closed[1] and these subsea wells {{will have to be}} permanently plugged and abandoned (PP&A) at some point. When the revenue of these subsea wells decreases and the cost is the driving factor, we are left with two options; permanently plug the reservoir section and reuse the <b>slot</b> by <b>drilling</b> a sidetrack or PP&A the subsea well. P&A operations is associated with high cost for the operating companies, licensees and the Norwegian taxpayers. To maintain the production on the NCS, one have to drill new wells to ensure new discoveries. However, as new wells are drilled others have to be PP&A. By using a riserless light well intervention (RLWI) vessel to conduct P&A operations, one can exclude the use of expensive mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) and consequently maintain the drilling activity on the NCS. The current practice is to use a semi-submersible rig with marine riser to perform the res-ervoir â€“ and intermediate abandonment. By utilizing the current practice and convert it to the new concept of conducting PP&A from a RLWI vessel, we could find the technology gap and the best suited subsea well candidates. The intention is to perform full riserless P&A operations using wireline, coiled tubing and main winch (i. e. a rig-less approach) combined with additional equipment. A large proportion of the current and future subsea wells on the NCS and {{in the rest of the}} world will be potential candidates for riserless PP&A with a RLWI vessel. Riserless P&A operations of subsea wells with low well abandonment complexity will most likely reduce the overall P&A expenditures because RLWI vessels has a lower day rate and an effective method of performing the P&A operation. The objective of this thesis is to identify the RLWI vesselâ€™s potential to perform full riserless P&A operations and present its operational boundaries with respect to well abandonment complexity.

40|$|In 2004 ConocoPhillips Norway (COPNO) drilled two {{multilateral}} {{wells in}} the Ekofisk {{field in the}} North Sea. These wells yielded more stable production rates, but had several issues and challenges {{when it came to}} junction stability and access to the side-branch. Due to matters related to the reservoir performance and the production rates, as well as optimized utilization of the <b>slot</b> spaces, the <b>drilling</b> of multilateral wells again has been listed as a possible future strategy for COPNO. In this Master Thesis three different multilateral well options, each with a mainbore (Lateral 1) and a side-branch (Lateral 2), for the Ekofisk South area has been evaluated in order to select the optimum configuration for a possible future implementation, based on six given reservoir targets. A project scope was established, including suggestion of junction design, junction placement and well paths. Further were physical limitations and technical challenges related to the drilling of multilateral wells on Ekofisk mapped, before a simulation base representing Ekofisk South was created in the Wellplan software. Based on the results from the simulations, an evaluation of the different multilateral well technology (MLT) options were performed, and a selection of the optimum multilateral well configuration on Ekofisk South for future success optimization with regards to the drilling process was executed. The report concludes that recommended type of multilateral for Ekofish South, based on the reservoir targets given, is the planar dual-lateral, or forked, multilateral. The junction should be placed in the overburden, 200 ? 300 ft above the top of Ekofisk in a stable formation. Of the investigated three MLT options the MLT 1 configuration indicates highest possibility of future success with regards to the drilling process. Further, a recommended composition of separate wellbores to form a new MLT option would include lateral 1 from MLT 1, the 9 Â½? lateral 2 section from MLT 2 and the 8 Â½? lateral 2 section from MLT 1. A trend was that that the longer wellbores indicated more issues, and that optimization of the well paths for the wellbore sections leading to the reservoir targets for the MLT options should be performed in order to mitigate any challenges with regards to elevated ECD effects. Future improvements involve the implementation of actual underground data to the simulation base, and an optimization of both the well paths and the BHA design used in the simulations. Simulations on junction design option 1, as well as investigations on the effects related to under reaming of the 8 Â½? and the 9 Â½? hole sections to 9 Â½? and 10 ?, respectively, summarize the most important suggestions of further work in the field...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. There is {{an urgent}} need for {{economic}} and technically sound concrete repair technologies in South Africa {{as the number of}} deteriorating RC structures needing repair is increasing. Currently, the South African concrete repair industry mainly relies on the application of patch repairs and corrosion inhibitors while other potentially successful methods such as sacrificial anodes are rarely applied. Sacrificial anode cathodic protection (SACP) systems use metals that are higher than steel in the electrochemical series. These metals corrode preferentially to steel thereby supplying electrons to the cathodic steel surface. Common SACP systems include discrete zinc anodes installed in <b>slots</b> or <b>drilled</b> holes, non -structural jacket encasements, and overlays made from expanded zinc mesh or any other convenient form. The effectiveness of discrete SACP systems in service life extension of chloride contaminated RC slabs has been investigated in this study. Similarly, the extent to which discrete sacrificial anodes can be used to extend the service life of corroding chloride contaminated RC structures has been assessed through an extensive review of literature a s well as laboratory experiments on corroding chloride contaminated RC slabs. This study evaluates the performance of discrete SACP systems with respect to binder type, corrosion rate and the level of chloride contamination with an objective of developing guidelines for rational concrete repair when using SACP systems to repair RC structures that are deteriorating from corrosion of reinforcing steel in South Africa. Eight slabs were investigated. Four slabs were cast using 100 % PC CEM 1, 42. 5 N while the other four were cast using a blend of 70 / 30 PC CEM 1, 42. 5 N/FA. Each slab comprised two portions: one half of each slab was cast using concrete that was admixed with 0. 6 % chloride by mass of binder while the other half was cast using concrete that was admixed with 1. 8 % chloride by mass of binder. The corrosion in the slabs was induced and accelerated using direct anodic current. The SACP system that was used in this study comprised discrete zinc disks put in a cylinder of a proprietary high alkaline mortar. The se anodes were installed in 1 0 0 x 10 0 x 60 mm deep cavities that had been made in concrete. The anodes were connected to the reinforcement cage using tie wires and thereafter backfilled with a repair mortar. The cavities in which the anodes were installed were arranged in a square grid of 450 x 450 mm. The corrosion rate and half-cell potential of the steel as well as the resistivity of concrete in the slabs were monitored over a duration of five month s. The discrete SACP system that has been investigated in this study can increase the service life of chloride contaminated RC structures that are deteriorating as a result of rebar corrosion. The discrete anodes reduced the corrosion rate of steel in the test slabs. The percentage reduction in the average corrosion rate was higher within the slabs that were cast using 100 % PC CEM 1, 42. 5 N than in the slabs that were cast using a blend of 70 / 30 PC CEM 1, 42. 5 N/FA. The reduction in average corrosion rate within the slabs cast using 100 % PC CEM 1, 42. 5 N ranged between 45 - 95 %. Similarly, the reduction in the average corrosion rate of within the slabs that were cast using a blend of 70 / 30 PC CEM, 42. 5 N 1 / FA ranged between 54 - 75 %. Throughout the test specimens, the portions of the slabs that was admixed with 0. 6 % chloride by mass of binder exhibited superior performance. These portions (admixed with 0. 6 % chloride by mass of binder) experienced the greatest reduction in average corrosion rate as well as the greatest shift in average half -cell potential towards values that are more negative. Finally, in order to achieve the long-term objective of increasing the service life of RC structures that are deteriorating as a result of rebar corrosion, lo ng-term studies ought to be undertaken to ascertain, with surety, the effectiveness of discrete SACP systems in corroding structures...|$|R
