50|$|The {{links between}} nodes are {{full-duplex}} 56, 64, 1,536, or 1,984 kbit/s graded communications channels. In Europe {{they are usually}} one (64 kbit/s) or all (1,984 kbit/s) timeslots (DS0s) within an E1 facility; in North America one (56 or 64 kbit/s) or all (1,536 kbit/s) timeslots (DS0As or DS0s) within a T1 facility.

50|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{security}} of calls via the public Internet have been addressed by encryption of the SIP protocol for secure transmission. The URI scheme sips is used to mandate that each hop over which the request is forwarded up to the target domain must be secured with Transport Layer Security (TLS). The last hop from the proxy of the target domain to the user agent has to be secured according to local policies. TLS protects against attackers who try to listen on the <b>signaling</b> <b>link</b> {{but it does not}} provide end-to-end security to prevent espionage and law enforcement interception, as the encryption is only hop-by-hop and every single intermediate proxy has to be trusted.|$|E
50|$|A Signal Transfer Point (STP) is {{a router}} that relays SS7 {{messages}} between signaling end-points (SEPs) and other signaling transfer points (STPs). Typical SEPs include service switching points (SSPs) and service control points (SCPs). The STP {{is connected to}} adjacent SEPs and STPs via signaling links. Based on the address fields of the SS7 messages, the STP routes the messages to the appropriate outgoing <b>signaling</b> <b>link.</b> Edge STPs can also route based upon message body content using deep packet inspection techniques, and can provide address translations and screen content to limit the transfer of messages with dubious content or sent from unreliable sources. To meet stringent reliability requirements, STPs are typically provisioned in mated pairs.|$|E

40|$|Signalling is the {{critical}} component of telecommunications networks. Thus {{the design of the}} signalling system is a fundamental issue for the creation of the future Broadband ISDN out of ATM switching technology. Today 2 ̆ 7 s telecommunication networks use common channel signalling networks (standardised in SS 7) which are often separate from the bearer or transport network. With an ATM based Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN), it is anticipated that both signalHng and user traffic will share the underlying ATM layer. An SS 7 2 ̆ 2 Message Transfer Part 2 ̆ 2 (MTP) provides reliable connectionless signalling message transport. However due to differences between SS 7 <b>links</b> and ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>links</b> (i. e. ATM Virtual Channel Connections (VCCs)), a new MTP will be needed for B-ISDN. This thesis is concerned with the design and engineering of the B-ISDN MTP The need for an ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>link</b> error monitor is identified as a key requirement. To design such an error monitor, the delay performance of ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>links</b> during errored periods must be determined. This requires a model for the delay performance of the Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP), the link level protocol to be used on ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>links.</b> The thesis presents an SSCOP delay model, which also gives general results for mean Selective Repeat transmitter delay and the mean (and distribution) of Selective Repeat receiver delay...|$|R
50|$|The drawing below {{shows how}} the {{voicemail}} system interacts with the PBX. Suppose an outside caller is calling Fred's extension 2345. The incoming call comes in from the public network (A) and comes into the PBX. The call is routed to Fred's extension (B), but Fred doesn't answer. After {{a certain number of}} rings, the PBX stops ringing Fred's extension and forwards the call to an extension connected to the voicemail system (C). It does this because PBXs are generally programmed to forward busy or unanswered calls to another extension. Simultaneously the PBX tells the voicemail system (through <b>signaling</b> <b>link</b> D) that the call it is forwarding to voice-mail is for Fred at extension 2345. In this way, the voicemail system can answer the call with Fred's greeting.|$|E
50|$|Obscurin {{belongs to}} the family of giant sarcomeric {{signaling}} proteins that includes titin and nebulin, and may have a role in the organization of myofibrils during assembly and may mediate interactions between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and myofibrils. Interestingly, Obscurin is the major cytoplasmic ligand for small ankyrin 1 (sANK1), a sarcoplasmic reticular protein, and the scaffolding function of obscurin appears to prevent degradation of sANK1. These data indicate that obscurin serves as a <b>signaling</b> <b>link</b> between the sarcomeric and sarcoplasmic reticular domains, Obscurin plays a role in the formation of new sarcomeres during myofibril assembly. specifically, at the sarcomeric periphery where sites of initiation and progression of myofibrilogenesis lie. Obscurin appears to be necessary for the proper incorporation of myosin filaments into sarcomeres and in the assembly of A-bands. Moreover, the kinase domains of obscurin are enzymatically active and appear {{to be involved in the}} regulation of cell adhesion.|$|E

Among the 26 genes deleted in hebiba, DWARF 14 LIKE is, the one responsible for loss of symbiosis.

40|$|AbstractERK and Akt kinases are key {{components}} that participate in numerous regulatory processes, including {{the response to}} stress. Using novel tools for quantitative immunofluorescence, we show that oxidant exposure controls the intracellular activation and localization of ERK 1 / 2 and Akt. Oxidative stress alters the nuclear/cytoplasmic levels of the kinases, drastically changing phospho-ERK 1 / 2 and phospho-Akt(Ser 473) levels in the nucleus. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of PI 3 kinase modulates the intracellular distribution of phospho-ERK 1 / 2, whereas MEK inhibition affects phospho-Akt(Thr 308) and phospho-Akt(Ser 473). Our studies identify a new <b>signaling</b> <b>link</b> in the nucleus of stressed cells, where changes in phospho-ERK 1 / 2 levels correlate directly with changes in phospho-Akt(Ser 473) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{signaling}} {{networks that}} drive the aging process, associated functional deterioration, and pathologies {{has captured the}} scientific community's attention for decades. While many theories exist to explain the aging process, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) provides a <b>signaling</b> <b>link</b> between engagement of cellular senescence and several age-associated pathologies. Cellular senescence has evolved to restrict tumor progression but the accompanying senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) promotes pathogenic pathways. Here, we review known biological theories of aging and how ROS mechanistically control senescence and the aging process. We also describe the redox-regulated signaling networks controlling the SASP and its important role in driving age-related diseases. Finally, we discuss progress in designing therapeutic strategies that manipulate the cellular redox environment to restrict age-associated pathology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The 66 -kilodalton isoform of {{the growth}} factor adapter Shc (p 66 (Shc)) {{translates}} oxidative damage into cell death by acting as reactive oxygen species (ROS) producer within mitochondria. However, the <b>signaling</b> <b>link</b> between cellular stress and mitochondrial proapoptotic activity of p 66 (Shc) was not known. We demonstrate that protein kinase C beta, activated by oxidative conditions in the cell, induces phosphorylation of p 66 Shc and triggers mitochondrial accumulation of the protein after it is recognized by the prolyl isomerase Pin 1. Once imported, p 66 (Shc) causes alterations of mitochondrial Ca 2 + responses and three-dimensional structure, thus inducing apoptosis. These data identify a signaling route that activates an apoptotic inducer shortening the life span and could be a potential target of pharmacological approaches to inhibit aging...|$|E

To {{understand the nature}} of the missing links between upstream insulin activated kinases and proteins of the GLUT 4 translocation apparatus, the role of 80 K-H was examined to test if it was one such missing link in live cells. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy showed that the mobility of 80 K-H was significantly decreased by insulin stimulation. This was dependent on the presence of PKCzeta and an intact binding site for PKCzeta. Insulin also increased the mobility of munc 18 c in an 80 K-H- and PKCzeta dependent manner. These results indicate that insulin induces dynamic associations between PKCzeta, 80 K-H, and munc 18 c and that 80 K-H may act as a key <b>signaling</b> <b>link</b> between PKCzeta and munc 18 c in live cells...|$|E
