25|$|Folk medicine, {{including}} ancient medicine of Egyptians, Greeks, Celts, Turks, Slavs, Mayans, Aztecs and Chinese, {{has used}} bruising {{as a treatment}} for some health problems. The methods vary widely and include cupping, scraping, and slapping. Fire cupping uses suction which causes bruising in patients. Scraping (Gua Sha) uses a <b>small</b> <b>hand</b> device with a rounded edge to gently scrape the scalp or the skin. Another ancient device that creates mild bruising is a strigil, used by Greeks and Romans in the bath. Archaeologically there is no precedent for scraping tools before Greek archaeological evidence, not Chinese or Egyptian.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} was {{operated by}} turning a <b>small</b> <b>hand</b> crank (now lost) which was linked via {{a crown gear}} to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible {{on the front of}} fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian ephemeris tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the Sun and Moon, the moon phase, eclipse, and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of planets.|$|E

Three types of drums are used in various combinations, depending upon regional style: the , a large barrel drum; the , a medium-sized drum similar to ones used in Noh theatre; and the paarankuu (...) , a <b>small</b> <b>hand</b> drum similar to ones used in Buddhist ceremony. [...] The dancers also sometimes play <b>small</b> <b>hand</b> gongs and yotsutake castanets. Eisa dancers wear various costumes, usually according to local tradition and gender of the dancer; modern costumes are often brightly colored and feature a characteristic, colorful knotted turban. Special vests, leggings, and shoes are also popular.|$|E
2500|$|Aubert {{made his}} {{international}} rugby league debut for the French national side at fullback during the 1944 season while on tour in Great Britain. He immediately achieved a cult following and status among rugby league {{fans and the}} sporting public for his [...] and [...] play coupled his lax attitude towards defence (often saying {{it was not the}} fullbacks job to tackle; other times claiming he was punishing fellow players for missing a tackle before him) and his odd onfield antics such as often playing while smoking at the same time. During half time breaks he was known to drink up to three glasses of red wine, and after scoring tries would occasionally leave a <b>small</b> <b>hand</b> written poem behind the opposing team's goal line designed to castigate and infuriate them. Despite all of this he was universally recognised among the rugby league fraternity as somewhat of a genius for his amazing kicking skill that he possessed in all of its forms.|$|E

About 70 percent of Italian troops were locally recruited Askari. The regular Eritrean battalions and the [...] (RCTC Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops) were among the best Italian units in the AOI and included Eritrean cavalry [...] (Falcon Feathers). (On one occasion a squadron of horse charged British and Commonwealth troops, throwing <b>small</b> <b>hand</b> grenades from the saddle.) Most colonial troops were recruited, trained and equipped for colonial repression, although the Somali Dubats from the borderlands were useful light infantry and skirmishers. Irregular bandes were hardy and mobile, knew the country and were effective scouts and saboteurs, although sometimes confused with Shifta, undisciplined marauders who plundered and murdered at will. Once Italy entered the war, a 100-strong company formed out of German residents of East African and German sailors unable to leave East African ports.|$|E

2500|$|Because the dry {{powdered}} ingredients must {{be mixed}} and bonded together for extrusion and cutting into grains {{to maintain the}} blend, size reduction and mixing is done while the ingredients are damp, usually with water. After 1800, instead of forming grains by hand or with sieves, the damp mill-cake was pressed in molds to increase its density and extract the liquid, forming press-cake. The pressing took varying amounts of time, depending on conditions such as atmospheric humidity. [...] The hard, dense product was broken again into tiny pieces, which were separated with sieves to produce a uniform product for each purpose: coarse powders for cannons, finer grained powders for muskets, and the finest for <b>small</b> <b>hand</b> guns and priming. Inappropriately fine-grained powder often caused cannons to burst before the projectile could move down the barrel, due to the high initial spike in pressure. Mammoth powder with large grains, made for Rodman's 15-inch cannon, reduced the pressure to only 20 percent as high as ordinary cannon powder would have produced.|$|E
