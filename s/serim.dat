The CIMMYT wheat line <b>SeriM</b> 82 has shown a significant yield advantage in multi-environment screening trials in this region. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the physiological basis of the adaptive traits underpinning this advantage. Six detailed experiments were conducted to compare the growth, development, and yield of <b>SeriM</b> 82 with that of the adapted cultivar, Hartog. The experiments were undertaken in field environments that represented the range of moisture availability conditions commonly encountered by winter crops grown on the deep Vertosol soils of this region. The yield of <b>SeriM</b> 82 was 6 - 28 % greater than that of Hartog, and <b>SeriM</b> 82 exhibited a stay-green phenotype by maintaining green leaf area longer during the grain-filling period in all environments where yield was significantly greater than Hartog. However, where the availability of deep soil moisture was limited, <b>SeriM</b> 82 failed to exhibit significantly greater yield or to express the stay-green phenotype. Thus, the stay-green phenotype was closely associated with the yield advantage of <b>SeriM</b> 82. <b>SeriM</b> 82 also exhibited higher mean grain mass than Hartog in all environments. It is suggested that small differences in water use before anthesis, or greater water extraction from depth after anthesis, could underlie the stay-green phenotype. The inability of <b>SeriM</b> 82 to exhibit stay-green and higher yield where deep soil moisture was depleted indicates that extraction of deep soil moisture is important...|$|E
40|$|Improving {{crop yields}} in rain-fed environments will be central to food {{security}} in a climate-changed world where rain, temperature and drought {{will be increasingly}} erratic. Yield improvement in such environments based on selection for yield per se has been slow due to large genotype by environment interactions (G x E).

The aims {{of this study were}} to examine root system characteristics of two wheat genotypes contrasting in tolerance to water limitation and to assess the functional implications on adaptation to water-limited environments of any differences found. The drought tolerant barley variety, Mackay, was also included to allow inter-species comparison. Single plants were grown in large, soil-filled root-observation chambers. Root growth was monitored by digital imaging and water extraction was measured. Root architecture differed markedly among the genotypes. The drought-tolerant wheat (cv. <b>SeriM</b> 82) had a compact root system, while roots of barley cv. Mackay occupied the largest soil volume. Relative to the standard wheat variety (Hartog), <b>SeriM</b> 82 had a more uniform rooting pattern and greater root length at depth. Despite the more compact root architecture of <b>SeriM</b> 82, total water extracted did not differ between wheat genotypes. To quantify the value of these adaptive traits, a simulation analysis was conducted with the cropping system model APSIM, {{for a wide range of}} environments in southern Queensland, Australia. The analysis indicated a mean relative yield benefit of 14. 5 % in water-deficit seasons.

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of the 1 BL/ 1 RS translocation in <b>SeriM</b> 82 /Babax recombinant population. 167 lines of this population were assayed under well-irrigated, terminal drought, heat and a combination of heat and drought stress conditions in two years. 5 S rDNA and Iag 95 markers were used to differentiate genotypes with or without the 1 BL/ 1 RS translocation. Presence of 1 BL/ 1 RS translocation reduced grain yield (YLD), grain per spike (GSP) and grain per m 2 (GM 2). QTLs in 1 BL/ 1 RS segments indicated increased thousand-grain weight (TGW), chlorophyll content, spikelet per spike (SPLS), spike compactness (SCOM) and awn length (AWL) but reduced YLD, GSP and GM 2. The 1 BL/ 1 RS carrying lines’ response varied between assayed environments. Plants of drought trials were more affected by 1 BL/ 1 RS compared to others. Differences in the effects of 1 BL/ 1 RS and QTLs suggest that gene expression at translocation loci is restricted to specific environmental conditions.

40|$|Root {{architecture}} {{traits in}} wheat {{are important in}} deep soil moisture acquisition and {{may be used to}} improve adaptation to water-limited environments. The genetic architecture of two root traits, seminal root angle and seminal root number, were investigated using a doubled haploid population derived from <b>SeriM</b> 82 and Hartog. Multiple novel quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified, each one having a modest effect. For seminal root angle, four QTL (-log 10 (P) > 3) were identified on 2 A, 3 D, 6 A and 6 B, and two suggestive QTL (-log 10 (P) > 2) on 5 D and 6 B. For root number, two QTL were identified on 4 A and 6 A with four suggestive QTL on 1 B, 3 A, 3 B and 4 A. QTL for root angle and root number did not co-locate. Transgressive segregation was found for both traits. Known major height and phenology loci appear to have little effect on root angle and number. Presence or absence of the T 1 BL. 1 RS translocation did not significantly influence root angle. Broad sense heritability (h 2) was estimated as 50 % for root angle and 31 % for root number. Root angle QTL were found to be segregating between wheat cultivars adapted to the target production region indicating potential to select for root angle in breeding programs. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|Stay-green” plants retain {{green leaf}} area longer after {{flowering}} than senescent types. This can prolong carbon assimilation during grain filling, increasing yield, particularly under terminal drought stress. A population of doubled haploid wheats (Triticum aestivum L.) {{derived from a}} cross between stay-green <b>SeriM</b> 82 and senescent Hartog was grown in eight environments {{with varying degrees of}} water limitation. The dynamics of normalised difference vegetative index (NDVI) was followed post-flowering to evaluate change in leaf greenness. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for components of stay-green including i) maximum NDVI (Nmax), ii) an indicator of the maximum rate of senescence (SR), iii) thermal time from flowering to commencement of senescence (OnS), iv) thermal time from flowering to mid-senescence (MidS), and v) the integral of NDVI from flowering to 1500 °Cd after flowering (SGint). Genetic regions associated with QTL for stay-green traits were identified (i) in both wet and dry environments on chromosomes 4 A, 4 B, 4 D (constitutive stay-green); (ii) primarily in wetter environments on 2 A and (iii) primarily in dryer environments on 5 B. Other regions associated with QTL for stay-green were identified on 3 B and 7 B in a mixture of environment types. In some environments, stay-green QTL co-located with QTL for seminal root angle, seedling root number and/or for yield. Other stay-green QTL were co-located with yield but not seminal root angle and seedling root number. This suggests genetic regions associated with seminal root angle and seedling root number are not solely responsible for the high yielding, stay-green phenotype. Selection for stay-green traits will increase the rate of genetic progress for adaptation of wheat to both well-watered and water-limited environments...|$|E
40|$|To prevent {{transmission}} in Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks, it {{is recommended}} to disinfect living things (hands and people) with 0. 05 % chlorine solution and non-living things (surfaces, personal protective equipment, dead bodies) with 0. 5 % chlorine solution. In the current West African EVD outbreak, these solutions (manufactured from calcium hypochlorite (HTH), sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC), and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)) {{have been widely used}} in both Ebola Treatment Unit and community settings. To ensure solution quality, testing is necessary, however test method appropriateness for these Ebola-relevant concentrations has not previously been evaluated. We identified fourteen commercially-available methods to test Ebola-relevant chlorine solution concentrations, including two titration methods, four DPD dilution methods, and six test strips. We assessed these methods by: 1) determining accuracy and precision by measuring in quintuplicate five different 0. 05 % and 0. 5 % chlorine solutions manufactured from NaDCC, HTH, and NaOCl; 2) conducting volunteer testing to assess ease-of-use; and, 3) determining costs. Accuracy was greatest in titration methods (reference- 12. 4 % error compared to reference method), then DPD dilution methods (2. 4 - 19 % error), then test strips (5. 2 - 48 % error); precision followed this same trend. Two methods had an accuracy of < 10 % error across all five chlorine solutions with good precision: Hach digital titration for 0. 05 % and 0. 5 % solutions (recommended for contexts with trained personnel and financial resources), and <b>Serim</b> test strips for 0. 05 % solutions (recommended for contexts where rapid, inexpensive, and low-training burden testing is needed). Measurement error from test methods not including pH adjustment varied significantly across the five chlorine solutions, which had pH values 5 - 11. Volunteers found test strip easiest and titration hardest; costs per 100 tests were $ 14 - 37 for test strips and $ 33 - 609 for titration. Given the ease-of-use and cost benefits of test strips, we recommend further development of test strips robust to pH variation and appropriate for Ebola-relevant chlorine solution concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Root system {{characteristics}} are of fundamental importance to soil exploration and below-ground resource acquisition. Root architectural traits determine the in situ space-filling properties of a root system or root architecture. The growth angle of root axes {{is a principal}} component of root system architecture that has been strongly associated with acquisition efficiency in many crop species. The aims {{of this study were}} to examine the extent of genotypic variability for the growth angle and number of seminal roots in 27 current Australian and 3 CIMMYT wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes, and to quantify using fractal analysis the root system architecture of a subset of wheat genotypes contrasting in drought tolerance and seminal root characteristics. The growth angle and number of seminal roots showed significant genotypic variation among the wheat genotypes with values ranging from 36 to 56 (degrees) and 3 to 5 (plant- 1), respectively. Cluster analysis of wheat genotypes based on similarity in their seminal root characteristics resulted in four groups. The group composition reflected to some extent the genetic background and environmental adaptation of genotypes. Wheat cultivars grown widely in the Mediterranean environments of southern and western Australia generally had wider growth angle and lower number of seminal axes. In contrast, cultivars with superior performance on deep clay soils in the northern cropping region, such as <b>SeriM</b> 82, Baxter, Babax, and Dharwar Dry exhibited a narrower angle of seminal axes. The wheat genotypes also showed significant variation in fractal dimension (D). The D values calculated for the individual segments of each root system suggested that, compared to the standard cultivar Hartog, the drought-tolerant genotypes adapted to the northern region tended to distribute relatively more roots in the soil volume directly underneath the plant. These findings suggest that wheat root system architecture is closely linked to the angle of seminal root axes at the seedling stage. The implications of genotypic variation in the seminal root characteristics and fractal dimension for specific adaptation to drought environment types are discussed with emphasis on the possible exploitation of root architectural traits in breeding for improved wheat cultivars for water-limited environments...|$|E

In this MSc. Thesis, {{a design}} metodology of a {{wideband}} microwave power amplifier using non-linear device model is proposed in details over a design example. And design steps are explained {{as could be}} as in details to be usefull for microwave power amplifier designers who encounter with similar issues. It {{can be considered as}} a motivation point that usage of a non-linear device model which is also take part on the name of this study. Because modelling and studying such a non-linear device can not be possible via linear equation sets {{and most of the time}} optimization algorithms can not convergence on the solution. In addition if the desired bandwidth is wide, it will be more difficult and nearly impossible to solve equations and  usage of the optimization algorithms will be useless due to the convergance problems. For these reasons, such a study is done using a computer-aided and user-driven method and design systems and design steps are explained in details as could be as possible. The Simplified Real Frequency Tecchnique (SRFT) which is popular in literature with its ability of broadband matching solutions also implemented in the design steps. And at the final of the work, a wideband microwave power amplifier is designed and prototyped in success. On the path of production, post layout simulation called “cosimulation” is implemented and realistic vendor models are used in the cosimulation to observe realistic effects. The simulation results of the designed circuit are seen sufficiently satisfying. After ideally designed and simulated with cosimulation tool, the circuit is prototyped and measured. Measurement results are in aggrement with simulation results which shows the prototyp circuit works well.   Classical microwave circuit design relies on the linear network parameters such as s-parameters due to their capability of characterizing the behavior of any linear circuit successfully. Furthermore, the classical design and analysis of linear microwave transistor based circuits are based on the simple analytical approaches which utilize the transistor s-parameters. So that it is not complicated to provide an analytical solution for the input and output variables and analytically determining fundamental parameters as the stability factor, the power gain contours or the input-output matching conditions. But all these happens when the microwave devices operates in their linear regions. S parameters depends on super position principle and only passive microwave circuits such as filters, couplers, power dividers, etc., and active microwave devices such as amplifiers that operates small signal operating points can be characterized in accuracy with them. If the amplifiers input signal level increases over its linear region, super position principle becomes no more useful, distortions such as gain compression, harmonic production and entermodluation begins to form. For the last few decades, the linear system theory was utilizing in success on the design of microwave circuits. This linearity approach was modelling the linear microwave devices succesfully and characterizing them consistently with the support of vectorel network analyzers (VNA). Nevertheless, todays systems of space and aeronautics, social media and mobile personal communication devices make it inevitable to operate the active network device in its non-linear region to improve efficiency and bandwidth. So on this path, usage of linear theory gives no more use and in becomes a neccesity to study the non-linear parameters and characterizing such devices with them. Some examples of these kind of non-linear applications can be found on RF power amplfier studies which requires high power and mostly operates its non-linear region. It is important to design of microwave power amplifiers with high power level and it depends to the transistors non-linear model to low cost design and high efficiency. One of the main problem in the microwave circuit design with large signals is the difficulty of the design with complex, non-linear devices to achieve desired delivered power level, desired efficiency and good reflectances. Since the non-liear device can not be modeled with linear equation sets, several design steps are required to achieve desired criterias on the input and output regions. And these processes take importance for time efficiency and performance. For this reason it is important that to select a suitable optimum design methodology for the desired circuit. In the study desired design criterias are achieved for the microwave power amplifier circuit which contains non-linear device model. On the design process, different kind of design techniques in the literature are used to solve different problems encountered on the different steps of the design.   The thesis contains six main chapters. In the first part, the introduction and problem definition take place. The second chapter of the study takes a brief look to the non-linear design models and discuss about why they are important and how they can be obtained comparing them small signal parameters. In the third chapter, power amplifiers and their design techniques are introduced. Some important parameters about power amplifier designs are explained in the chapter three. Also in this chapter, broadband matching problems and some common matching techniques are explained.   The fourth chapter, which is the longest part of the study is the section where the design of broadband microwave power amplifier with non-linear device model started. In this section, the matching techniques are implemented, reflectance levels of the circuit are reduced, flat gain is obtained and all desing criterias are achieved over the ideal case and the ideal design is completed with high success. In the fifth chapter, the designed ideal circuit in chapter four is prepared for the prototype production. The layout design is made and cosimulations are performed. According to the results, the post layout optimizations are done and also good results are obtained for the post layout design. Also in this chapter, the prototyped circuit and its measurement results are given. It is observed that the measurement results are in a good agreements with simulation results.   The last section, chapter six is the conclusion part. In this section, the completed study is overviewed and required discussion and future works are given. In the final of the work, a microwave power amplifier with a ultra-wide bandwidth from ~ 0. 8 GHz to ~ 3. 2 GHz, and has nearly 4 - 6 Watt output power on the operating bandwidth is achieved. The harmonic performance shows also good results. Circuit is includes Cree’s Gan HEMT power transistor and designed with it’s  large signal model. Input and outpt matching networks are designed with using several methods in combination. All the design steps are detailed in related section.   However the design of a wideband microwave power amplifier using non linear device model is explained over a design example. The study and techniques that used can be generalized for different design criterias. And it is hoped that this study will help power amplifier designers challenging with wide bandwidth and non-linear devices. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Sustainability and {{maintenance}} of riparian vegetation or restoring of degraded sites is critical to sustain inherent ecosystem function and values. Description of patterns in species assemblages and diversity is an essential step before generating hypotheses in functional ecology. If {{we want to have}} information about ecosystem function, soil biodiversity is best considered by focusing on the groups of soil organisms that play major roles in ecosystem functioning when exploring links with provision of ecosystem services. Information about the spatial pattern of soil biodiversity at the regional scale is limited though required, e. g. for understanding regional scale effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes. The practical consequences of these findings are useful for sustainable management of soils and in monitoring soil quality. Soil macrofauna play significant, but largely ignored roles in the delivery of ecosystem services by soils at plot and landscape scales. One main reason responsible for the absence of information about biodiversity at regional scale is the lack of adequate methods for sampling and analyzing data at this dimension. An adequate approach for the analysis of spatial patterns is a transect study in which samples are taken in a certain order and with a certain distance between samples. Geostatistics provide descriptive tools such as variogram to characterize the spatial pattern of continuous and categorical soil attributes. This method allows assessment of consistency of spatial patterns as well as the scale at which they are expressed. This study was conducted to analyze spatial patterns of soil macrofauna in relation to tree canopy in the riparian forest landscape of Maroon. Materilas and Methods: The study was carried out in the Maroon riparian forest of the southeasternIran (30 o 38 /- 30 o 39 / N and 50 o 9 /- 50 o 10 / E). The climate of the study area is semi-arid. Average yearly rainfall is about 350. 04 mm with a mean temperature of 24. 5 oc. Plant cover, mainly comprises Populus euphratica Olivie and Tamarix arceuthoides Bge and Lycium shawii Roemer & Schultes. Soil macrofauna were sampled using 175 sampling point along parallel transects (perpendicular to the river). The distance between transects was 100 m. We considered distance between samples as 50 m. tree canopy were measured in 5 * 5 plots. soil macrofauna were extracted from 50 cm× 50 cm× 10 cm soil monolith by hand-sorting procedure. All soil macrofauna were identified to family level. Evenness (Sheldon index), richness (Menhinich index) and diversity (Shannon H’ index) by using PAST version 1. 39, were determined in each sample. Classical statistical parameters, i. e. mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, minimum and maximum, were calculated using SPSS 17 software. For analysis of the relationship between Soil macrofauna diversity indices and tree canopy (Total canopy, Populous canopy, Tamarix canopy and <b>Serim</b> canopy) we calculated the correlation among soil properties and macrofauna using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Next, to determining the spatial structure, we calculated the semivariances. Semivariance quantifies the spatial dependence of spatially ordered variable values. In order to gather information about the spatial connection between any two variables, and to compare the similarity of their spatial structure patterns, cross-variograms were constructed. Cross-variograms are plots of cross-semivariance against the lag distance. Results and Discussion: Soil macrofauna communities were dominated by earthworm, diplopods, coleoptera, gastropoda, araneae, and insect larvae. Correlation analysis of soil macrofauna and tree canopy indicated weak relationships between them. Weak, but significant relationships were found between macrofauna diversity, evenness, richness and total canopy, Populous canopy and Tamarix canopy (positive). Macrofauna indices and tree canopy(excepted Tamarix canopy) were spatially structured; the variograms revealed the presence of spatial autocorrelation. The variograms of variables especially tree canopy, were characterized by relatively large nugget values, which can be explained by sampling error, short range variability, random and inherent variability. Soil macrofauna diversity indices and tree canopy were moderately spatially dependent. Spatial similarity between variables, indicating potential relationships between macrofauna and tree canopy, was evaluated by cross-variograms for pairs of macrofauna indices and measured tree canopy. According to the cross-variograms, using RSS as criterion for model performance, macrofauna diversity were spatially closely related to total tree canopy, Populus canopy. Spatial distribution of soil macrofauna may be influenced by factors like gradients in soil properties and vegetation cover structure. These factors together with intrinsic population processes constitute proximate controlling factors of population structure. Conclusion: The relationship between macrofauna indices and tree canopy was further explored by means of spatial analyses. Macrofauna indices and tree canopy (excepted Tamarix canopy) were spatially structured. Tree canopy distribution is important for the spatial variability and structure of Soil macrofauna diversity...|$|E
