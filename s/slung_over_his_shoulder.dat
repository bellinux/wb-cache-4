25|$|In {{the second}} scene, Odysseus threatens the sorceress with a drawn sword, as Homer {{describes}} it. However, he is sometimes depicted carrying spears as well, {{as in the}} Athens lekythos, while Homer reports {{that it was a}} bow he had <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> In this episode Circe is generally shown in flight, and on the Erlangen lekythos can clearly be seen dropping the bowl and wand behind her. Two curiously primitive wine bowls incorporate the Homeric detail of Circe's handloom, at which the men approaching her palace could hear her singing sweetly as she worked. In the 5th century skyphos from Boeotia an apparently crippled Odysseus leans on a crutch while a woman with negroid features holds out a disproportionately large bowl. In the other, a pot-bellied hero brandishes a sword while Circe stirs her potion. Both these may depict the scene as represented in one or other of the comic satyr plays which deal with their encounter. Little remains of these now beyond a few lines by Aeschylus, Ephippus of Athens and Anaxilas. Other vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual satyrs. The reason that it should be a subject of such plays is that wine drinking was often central to their plot. Later writers were to follow Socrates in interpreting the episode as illustrating the dangers of drunkenness.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{depictions of}} the death or murder of Troilus are on shield bands {{from the turn of}} the 7th into the 6th century BC found at Olympia. On these, a warrior with a sword is about to stab a naked youth at an altar. On one, Troilus clings to a tree (which Boitani takes for the laurel sacred to Apollo). [...] A crater contemporary with this shows Achilles at the altar holding the naked Troilus upside down while Hector, Aeneas and an otherwise unknown Trojan Deithynos arrive in the hope of saving the youth. In some depictions Troilus is begging for mercy. On an amphora, Achilles has the struggling Troilus <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> as he goes to the altar. Boitani, in his survey of the story of Troilus through the ages, considers it of significance that two artifacts (a vase and a sarcophagus) from different periods link Troilus' and Priam's death by showing them on {{the two sides of the}} same item, as if they were the beginning and end of the story of the fall of Troy. [...] Achilles is the father of Neoptolemus, who slays Priam at the altar during the sack of Troy. Thus the war opens with a father killing a son and closes with a son killing a father.|$|E
60|$|Just then a rifle-shot sounded from {{up in the}} ravine. The men {{paused in}} their tasks and looked at one another. Then {{reassured}} by this exchange of glances, they fell to work again.

[...] When {{he arrived at the}} yard of trainer, William Cooper, [...] "one of the most upright trainers and best men that ever lived", he was initially dismissed on account of his dishevelled appearance. [...] Cooper's wife took kindly to him, though, and pleaded Flatman's cause to her husband. [...] As a result, Flatman was taken on as apprentice to the Cooper stable in 1825.|$|E

60|$|This {{last was}} a fire-bag--so called because it {{contained}} the flint, steel, and tinder required {{for making a}} fire. It also contained Jasper's pipe and tobacco--for he smoked, {{as a matter of}} course. Men smoke everywhere--more's the pity--and Jasper followed the example of those around him. Smoking was almost his only fault. He was a tremendous smoker. Often, when out of tobacco, he had smoked tea. Frequently he had tried bark and dried leaves; and once, when hard pressed, he had smoked oakum. He would rather have gone without his supper than without his pipe! A powder-horn and shot pouch were <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> by two cross belts, and he carried a long single-barrelled gun.|$|R

5000|$|In Rome, Brother Felix {{became a}} {{familiar}} sight, wandering barefoot through the streets, with a sack <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> {{knocking on doors}} to seek donations. He received permission from his superiors to help the needy, especially widows with many children. It is said that his begging sack was as bottomless as his heart. Brother Felix blessed all benefactors and all those he met with a humble “Deo Gratias!” (thanks be to God!), causing many to refer to him as “Brother Deo Gratias". [...] Felix was so successful in his work that during the famine of 1580, the political leader of Rome asked the Capuchins if they would 'lend' Felix to them so he could collect food and provisions for the entire city. The Capuchins agreed and Felix embraced his new task.|$|R
