[...] The Chicago Tribune Eric Zorn, watching Glee for the first time, deemed the episode [...] "deliriously, deliciously bad", deriding the casting of young adult actors as teenagers, the [...] "one-dimensional stock characters" [...] and the [...] "kitschy plots".

After the apology, Kuhl said he thought Patton was [...] "a great general," [...] and that [...] "at the time, he didn't know how sick I was."
