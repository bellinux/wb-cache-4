5|$|In human anatomy, a bursa {{is a small}} pouch {{filled with}} <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid.</b> Its purpose is to reduce {{friction}} between adjacent structures.

Glucosamine concentrations in plasma and <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> increased significantly from baseline levels and the levels in the two fluids were highly correlated. The authors interpreted that these levels could be biologically advantageous to articular cartilage, but the levels are still 10 - 100 fold lower than required to positively affect the cartilage (chondrocytes) to build new tissue.

25|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{measured}} the bioavailability of glucosamine after oral administration to horses. When given as a single oral dose (nine grams) with or without chondroitin sulfate (three grams) to ten horses, glucosamine (hydrochloride) was detected in the blood with a maximum level of 10.6 (+/- 6.9) micrograms per millilitre at two hours after dosing. Another study examined both the serum and the joint <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> after nasogastric (oral) or intravenous administration of 20mg/kg glucosamine hydrochloride to eight adult horses. Although joint fluid concentrations of glucosamine reached 9 - 15 micromolar following intravenous dosing, it was only 0.3 - 0.7 micromolar with nasogastric dosing. The authors calculated that these glucosamine <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> levels achieved by the oral route were 500 fold lower than that required to {{have a positive effect on}} the metabolism of cartilage cells. A follow up study by the same research group compared glucosamine sulfate with glucosamine hydrochloride at the same dose (20mg/kg) in eight horses and found a higher fluid concentration with the sulfate preparation (158ng/mL compared to 89ng/mL one hour post oral dose). They concluded that these higher <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> levels obtained with the sulfate derivative were still too low to have a relevant biological effect on articular cartilage.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} usually manifests about 1–3 {{weeks after}} a known infection.

40|$|AbstractObjective This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assay cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) in equine <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> and to compare the concentration in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> from normal horses with joint diseased horses. The relationship between the COMP degradation and the matrix metalloproteinase activity in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> was also investigated. Design Using COMP antigen prepared from equine articular cartilage and murine monoclonal antibody (12 C 4) raised against human COMP, an inhibition ELISA was developed. COMP in equine <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> from normal and diseased joints was quantified. Metalloproteinase activities were evaluated in the same <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> by a gelatin degradation ELISA. COMP fragments were evaluated qualitatively by Western blotting. Results The COMP inhibition ELISA was reliable at concentrations of equine COMP between 62. 5 and 2000 ng/ml. COMP values in joint fluids in both aseptic and septic joint disease (19. 7 ± 15. 3 and 16. 1 ± 11. 2 μg/ml, respectively) were significantly (P< 0. 001) lower than normal (53. 2 ± 29. 0 μg/ml). The molecular sizes of COMP on immunoblots were different between normal and diseased synovial fluids; more fragments were seen in diseased fluids. The aseptic (26. 6 ± 20. 6 %) and septic joint disease <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> (36. 1 ± 37. 5 %) had significantly higher (P< 0. 02 and 0. 002, respectively) gelatinolytic activities than normal (13. 6 ± 13. 7 %). There was a negative correlation (R=− 0. 31, P< 0. 002) between COMP level and gelatinase activity. Conclusions We conclude that the fragment pattern and the absolute COMP concentration maybe useful for monitoring joint disease, and that COMP degradation in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> from progressed joint disease may be due to MMP gelatinolytic activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{diffusivity}} of water, fucose, proline, lysine, glutamic acid, glucose and sucrose {{was determined}} {{in a variety}} of inflammatory human <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids.</b> In view of the constituents of pathological <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> one would predict impedence to solute movement.

25|$|Lumiracoxib {{is unique}} amongst the coxibs {{in being a}} weak acid. It was {{developed}} {{for the treatment of}} osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and acute pain. The acidic nature of lumiracoxib allows it to penetrate well into areas of inflammation. It has shown to be rapidly and well absorbed, with peak plasma concentration occurring in about 1–3 hours. A study showed that when a subject was given 400nbsp&mg dose, the amount of unchanged drug in the plasma 2.5 hours postdose suggest a modest first pass effect. The terminal half-life in plasma ranged from 5.4 to 8.6 hours (mean =6.5 hours). The half-life in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> is considerably longer than in plasma, and the concentration in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> 24 hours after administration would be expected to result in a substantial COX-2 inhibition. This fact can explain why some users may suffice with once-daily dosage despite a short plasma half-life. The major plasma metabolites are 5-carboxy, 4’-hydroxy, and 4’-hydroxy-5-carboxy derivatives. Lumiracoxib is extensively metabolized before it is excreted, and the excretion routes are in the urine or feces. Peak plasma concentrations exceed those necessary to maximally inhibit COX-2, and that is consistent with a longer pharmacodynamic half-life. In vitro lumiracoxib has demonstrated a greater COX-2 selectivity {{than any of the other}} coxibs.|$|E

40|$|A large {{per cent}} of {{rheumatoid}} <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> contain chemotactic activity for rabbit granulocytes (neutrophilic). The chemotactic activity is, in large part, {{related to the}} fifth (C 5) and sixth (C 6) components of human complement; a combination of physical-chemical techniques indicates the activity to be attributable to C 567 and C 5 a, a cleavage product of C 5. Many rheumatoid <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> contain a C 5 -cleaving enzyme which, {{on the basis of}} substrate specificity and susceptibility to inhibitors, is very similar to an enzyme extractable from lysosomal granules of human and rabbit granulocytes.

25|$|The unique {{feature of}} the {{temporomandibular}} joint is the articular disc. The disc is composed of dense fibrous connective tissue that is positioned between the two bones that form the joint. The temporomandibular joints {{are one of the}} few synovial joints in the human body with an articular disc, another being the sternoclavicular joint. The disc divides each joint into two.These two compartments are synovial cavities, which consists of an upper and a lower synovial cavity. The synovial membrane lining the joint capsule produces the <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> that fills these cavities.|$|E
25|$|The {{central area}} of the disc is {{avascular}} and lacks innervation, and, in contrast, the peripheral region has both blood vessels and nerves. Few cells are present, but fibroblasts and white blood cells are among these. The central area is also thinner but of denser consistency than the peripheral region, which is thicker but has a more cushioned consistency. The <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> in the synovial cavities provides the nutrition for the avascular central {{area of the}} disc.

25|$|One {{problem with}} using a {{specific}} collagen type II biomarker from {{the breakdown of}} articular cartilage is {{that the amount of}} cartilage is reduced (worn away) over time with progression of the disease so a patient can eventually have very advanced osteoarthritis with none of this biomarker detectable in their urine. Another problem with a systemic biomarker is that a patient can have osteoarthritis in multiple joints at different stages of disease at the same time, so the biomarker source cannot be determined.

40|$|Synovial {{inflammation}} {{is often}} associated with systemic changes, such as increased levels of acute phase proteins and hypergammaglobulinemia, which cannot be explained by the cytokines described in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> and synoviocyte secre-tions.

Jackson was signed for the Capitals' next two seasons, and expected to join the team in November 2014, after recovering from a hip surgery she went through in September. Jackson's return happened in December 19 against the Adelaide Lightning. Jackson managed to play five more games in the 2014–15 WNBL season, losing only one as she averaged 13 points and seven rebounds.

However combinations of anti-cytokine antibodies used together (anti-IL- 15 +anti-MCP- 1; anti-IL- 8 +anti-MCP- 1 or +anti-MIP- 1 α) inhibited most of the activity, suggesting that attraction of lymphocytes by the fluids is due to a combination of attractants. Blood lymphocytes required activation by overnight culture to respond optimally, while rheumatoid synovial tissue lymphocytes responded to <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> without a requirement for a period of culture. Lymphocytes derived from rheumatoid <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> were poorly responsive to locomotor stimulants. Most of the responding cells from blood mononuclear cell fractions were T lymphocytes of the CD 45 RO isotype.
