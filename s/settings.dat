5|$|In early {{editions of}} the setting, The Realms shared a unified {{cosmology}} with various other campaign <b>settings</b> called the Great Wheel. In this way each of the Dungeons & Dragons campaign <b>settings</b> were linked together to form one interwoven world connected by various planes of existence. With {{the release of the}} 2001 Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, the setting was given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other <b>settings.</b>|$|E
5|$|In writing {{polyphonic}} <b>settings</b> of psalms, Josquin was a pioneer, and psalm <b>settings</b> form a {{large proportion}} of the motets of his later years. Few composers prior to Josquin had written polyphonic psalm <b>settings.</b> Some of Josquin's <b>settings</b> include the famous Miserere, written in Ferrara in 1503 or 1504 and most likely inspired by the recent execution of the reformist monk Girolamo Savonarola, Memor esto verbi tui, based on Psalm 119, and two <b>settings</b> of De profundis (Psalm 130), both of which are often considered to be among his most significant accomplishments.|$|E
5|$|LARPs {{can have}} any genre, {{although}} many use themes and <b>settings</b> derived from genre fiction. Some LARPs borrow a setting from an established work in another medium (e.g., The Lord of the Rings or the World of Darkness), while others use <b>settings</b> {{based on the}} real world or designed specifically for the LARP. Proprietary campaign <b>settings,</b> together with rulesets, are often the principal creative asset of LARP groups and LARP publishers.|$|E

In the <b>setting's</b> present, surveillance by elderly retirees wearing recognizable networked camera-glasses is common.|$|R

5|$|A coolant {{control valve}} {{is mounted on}} the {{combustion}} chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle <b>settings</b> of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle <b>settings</b> between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's other {{compositions}} {{during the}} war included incidental music for a children's play, The Starlight Express (1915); a ballet, The Sanguine Fan (1917); and The Spirit of England (1915â€“17, to poems by Laurence Binyon), three choral <b>settings</b> very different in character from the romantic patriotism of his earlier years. His last large-scale composition of the war years was The Fringes of the Fleet, <b>settings</b> of verses by Rudyard Kipling, performed with great popular success around the country, until Kipling for unexplained reasons objected to their performance in theatres. Elgar conducted a recording of the work for the Gramophone Company.|$|E
5|$|Fantasy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common LARP genres internationally and is the genre that the largest events use. Fantasy LARPs are set in pseudo-historical worlds {{inspired}} by fantasy literature and fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. These <b>settings</b> typically have magic, fantasy races, and limited technology. Many fantasy LARPs focus on adventure or on competition between character factions. In contrast, science fiction LARPs take place in futuristic <b>settings</b> with high technology and sometimes with extraterrestrial life. This describes a broad array of LARPs, including politically themed LARPs depicting dystopian or utopian societies and <b>settings</b> inspired by cyberpunk, space opera and post-apocalyptic fiction.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{attachment}} theory {{had significant}} policy implications for hospitalized or institutionalized children, {{and those in}} poor quality daycare. Controversy remains over whether non-maternal care, particularly in group <b>settings,</b> has deleterious effects on social development. It is plain from research that poor quality care carries risks but that those who experience good quality alternative care cope well although {{it is difficult to}} provide good quality, individualized care in group <b>settings.</b>|$|E

5|$|Josquin's motet style {{varied from}} almost {{strictly}} homophonic <b>settings</b> with block chords and syllabic text declamation to highly ornate contrapuntal fantasias, to the psalm <b>settings</b> which combined these extremes {{with the addition}} of rhetorical figures and text-painting that foreshadowed the later development of the madrigal. He wrote many of his motets for four voices, an ensemble size which had become the compositional norm around 1500, and he was also a considerable innovator in writing motets for five and six voices. No motets of more than six voices have been reliably attributed to Josquin.|$|E
