Papillons are a very active breed of dog and enjoy having a job to perform. Papillon Breeders recommend dog agility, Rally obedience, Obedience for Papillons because of their intelligence and energy level.|$|E

I could not find my stick, and he said, 'Never mind, my boy, I shall see a good deal of you now, I hope, and I will keep your stick until you come back to claim it.' I left him there, the <b>safe</b> <b>open,</b> and the papers made up in packets upon the table. It was so late that I could not get back to Blackheath, so I spent the night at the Anerley Arms, and I knew nothing more until I read of this horrible affair in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|Margaret and Castell {{were sent}} below, the crew went to quarters, and Peter crept stiffly aft {{to where the}} sturdy Smith stood at the helm, which he would suffer no other man to touch. Smith looked at the sky, {{he looked at the}} shore, and the <b>safe,</b> <b>open</b> sea beyond. Then he bade them hoist more sail, all that she could carry, and looked grimly at the two galleys lurking like deerhounds in a pass, that hung on their oars in the strait channel, with the {{tumbling}} breakers on either side, through which no ship could sail.

6000|$|... "Now {{comes the}} crown of my argument. The purpose {{of the attack on}} me was to get the <b>safe</b> <b>open,</b> so that the sacred Jewel of Seven Stars could be extracted. That immense door of the safe could not keep out her astral body, which, or any part of it, could gather itself as well within as without the safe. And I doubt not that in the {{darkness}} of the night that mummied hand sought often the Talisman Jewel, and drew new inspiration from its touch. But despite all its power, the astral body could not remove the Jewel through the chinks of the safe. The Ruby is not astral; and it could only be moved in the ordinary way by the opening of the doors. To this end, the Queen used her astral body and the fierce force of her Familiar, to bring to the keyhole of the safe the master key which debarred her wish. For years I have suspected, nay, have believed as much; and I, too, guarded myself against powers of the Nether World. I, too, waited in patience till I should have gathered together all the factors required for the opening of the Magic Coffer and the resurrection of the mummied Queen!" [...] He paused, and his daughter's voice came out sweet and clear, and full of intense feeling: ...|$|E

50|$|In acute angle-closure {{glaucoma}} cases, surgical iridectomy {{has been}} superseded by Nd:YAG laser iridotomy, because the laser procedure is much <b>safer.</b> <b>Opening</b> the globe for a surgical iridectomy {{in a patient}} with high intraocular pressure greatly {{increases the risk of}} suprachoroidal hemorrhage, with potential for associated expulsive hemorrhage. Nd:YAG laser iridotomy avoids such a catastrophe by laser created hole in the iris, which facilitates flow of aqueous humor from the posterior to the anterior chamber of the eye.|$|R

50|$|Cairns {{are active}} dogs, thus need a daily walk. Play {{takes care of}} a lot of their {{exercise}} needs; however, as with all breeds, play will not fulfill their primal instinct to walk.

50|$|One {{immediate}} {{result of}} the Peace of Paris of 1856 was the reopening of the Black Sea for <b>safe,</b> <b>open</b> international trade.

25|$|Peter Gimbel later {{conducted}} {{a number of}} salvage operations on the ship, including salvaging the first-class bank safe in 1981. Despite speculation that passengers had deposited many valuables, the <b>safe,</b> <b>opened</b> on live television in 1984, yielded thousands of American silver certificates, Canadian bank notes, American Express travellers checks, and Italian bank notes, but no other valuables. This outcome apparently confirmed other speculation that most Andrea Doria passengers, {{in anticipation of the}} ship's scheduled arrival in New York City the following morning, had already retrieved their valuables prior to the collision.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is divided}} {{into a series of}} single-screen levels.

The jumping action is in a fixed pattern and cannot be altered once initiated. Gameplay reduces to learning the best order in which to collect the keys, and correct timing of movements and jumping.|$|R

Organizations such as Philadelphia Green, organized by the Philadelphia Horticultural Society, have helped communities organize gardens to build community feeling and improve neighborhoods. They can be places for socialization, fresh vegetables in neighborhoods poorly served by supermarkets, and sources of traditional African American produce.|$|E
