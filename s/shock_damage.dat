5|$|The second torpedo struck Bismarck in her stern on {{the port}} side, near the port rudder shaft. The {{coupling}} {{on the port}} rudder assembly was badly damaged and the rudder became locked in a 12° turn to port. The explosion also caused much <b>shock</b> <b>damage.</b> The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by Lütjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless. At 21:15, Lütjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Arkansas {{participated in}} Operation Magic Carpet, the {{repatriation}} of American servicemen from the Pacific. She took around 800 men back to the United States, departing on 23 September, and reaching Seattle, Washington on 15 October. She made another three Magic Carpet trips between Pearl Harbor and the continental United States to ferry more soldiers home. During the first months of 1946, Arkansas lay at San Francisco. In late April, the ship got underway for Hawaii. She reached Pearl Harbor on 8 May, and departed Pearl Harbor on 20 May, bound for Bikini Atoll, earmarked for use as target for atomic bomb testing in Operation Crossroads. On 1 July, Arkansas was exposed to an air burst in ABLE, but survived with extensive <b>shock</b> <b>damage</b> to her upperworks, while her hull and armored turrets were lightly damaged.|$|E
5|$|After her refit was {{completed}} on 18 January 1944, Steinbrinck {{and her sister}} Theodor Riedel spent {{the first half of}} the year laying minefields at the entrance to the Skaggerak and escorting convoys to and from Norway. On 3 May the ship passed through the Kiel Canal en route to Hamburg for a lengthy refit. While in the dockyard, she was struck by a bomb in the diesel generator room on 18 June. Despite the extent of the damage, the dockyard reported that her refit would be completed as scheduled on 20 November. On 4 November another bomb detonated alongside Steinbrinck and caused extensive flooding and <b>shock</b> <b>damage</b> from the explosion. The ship was patched up and towed to Wesermünde for more thorough repairs, but her completion was seriously delayed. By 1 April 1945, only a single engine was operable and the Kriegsmarine made the decision to strip her crew for combat duties ashore after she was moved to Cuxhaven. She was still there in May when the Germans surrendered.|$|E

At this time her complement was 1,997 officers and enlisted men. By 1945, accumulated wear-and-tear as well as undiagnosed <b>shock</b> <b>damage</b> to Illustriouss machinery caused severe vibrations in her centre propeller shaft at high speeds.

500|$|While two {{bombs that}} {{exploded}} in the water near Tirpitz opened holes in her hull and caused flooding, none of the 15 bombs that struck the battleship penetrated her main deck armour belt. As a result, her guns, magazines, and machinery did not suffer serious damage. Most of {{the damage to the}} battleship was inflicted on her superstructure and between her armoured decks. The starboard aircraft catapult and crane were destroyed, as were both Tirpitzs Arado floatplanes. The number two starboard [...] gun turret was knocked out, and the number three port 150mm turret incurred significant damage. The officers' mess and several galleys were wrecked, and the ship was filled with smoke. Tirpitzs funnel was also struck by bomb fragments that badly damaged all of the boiler intakes. While the starboard turbine was knocked out by <b>shock</b> <b>damage</b> and two of the boilers were disabled after being contaminated by salt water used for firefighting, the battleship was still capable of steaming within Kaafjord. Tirpitzs crew suffered heavy casualties in the attack. Overall, 122 sailors died and 316 were wounded; these casualties represented 15 percent of the battleship's crew. Many of the casualties were anti-aircraft gunners who were killed or wounded by machine-gun fire from the British fighters.|$|E
