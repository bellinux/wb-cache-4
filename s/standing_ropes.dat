5000|$|All Shook Up: Players {{have to hang}} on to a pair of {{parallel}} ropes that are stretched out over a muddy pit, and have to shake their opponents off the ropes. The challenge is played in multiple rounds — guys vs. guys and girls vs. girls — with the winners of the first three rounds advancing to the final round. The last player <b>standing</b> on the <b>ropes</b> wins the challenge.|$|R
50|$|A Topé, {{like the}} Plancha, is a move most often {{performed}} by jumping {{from the inside}} of the ring and out, but instead of going over the top rope, the Topé is performed by <b>standing</b> through the <b>ropes</b> to strike the opponent with the head. In Mexico, the Topé also refers to any leaping move where the head strikes the opponent, be it by jumping off the middle rope or a handspring into a headbutt.|$|R
50|$|The first main frieze {{image is}} of boar hunting, {{depicting}} a hunter's arrow {{stuck in his}} shoulder. Kneeling on his right leg, the hunter has his bow set up on his lap, ready to shoot. In front of the wounded boar there is a lion, and behind there is a leopard. They are followed by an intermitted group of lions and leopards. Behind the hunter, there is a dog <b>standing</b> with a <b>rope</b> tied around his neck.|$|R
5000|$|... 15:30 Start descent. After {{passing the}} {{triangle}} snowfield they saw some unidentifiable object above the Second Step. Below the First Step, they saw one {{person on the}} fixed rope. Shigekawa therefore stopped and radioed Base Camp. As he started moving again he met someone, who had possibly been on the fixed <b>rope,</b> <b>standing</b> nearby. They exchanged greetings, but Shigekawa was still unable to identify him. The Japanese climbers' oxygen was just enough to return to Camp 6.|$|R

Below the center, a crowd of people is surrounding a golf player while <b>standing</b> behind a <b>rope</b> fence. The golf course extends towards the background. People {{can be seen in the}} left, who seem to be walking in different directions. All individuals are standing on a grassy lawn. Houses and mountain silhouettes are observable in the horizon...|$|R
50|$|The {{buntline}} hitch is a knot {{used for}} attaching a rope to an object. It is formed by passing the working end around an object, then making a clove hitch around the <b>rope's</b> <b>standing</b> part, taking care that the turns of the clove hitch progress towards the object rather than away from it. Secure and easily tied, the buntline hitch will jam when subjected to extreme loads. Given the knot's propensity to jam, {{it is often}} made in slipped form.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are more}} than 40 kinds of Jultagi {{techniques}} including a walking on a tight rope as the basic motion, a reversed walking on it, leaping with one foot on it, sitting and lying on it, and sometimes pretending to fall down. [...] Another elaborate tightrope walking trick is jumping up after kneeling on the tightrope with one knee and then landing on the rope in a cross-legged sitting position.Some expert tightrope walkers can jump forward while <b>standing</b> on the <b>rope</b> without falling.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The study's {{purpose was}} to {{identify}} children's physical activity type using artificial neural network (ANN) models based on uniaxial or triaxial accelerometer data from the hip or the ankle. Methods: Fifty-eight children (31 boys and 27 girls, age range = 9 - 12 yr) performed the following activities in a field setting: sitting, <b>standing,</b> walking, running, <b>rope</b> skipping, playing soccer, and cycling. All children wore uniaxial and triaxial ActiGraph accelerometers on both the hip and the ankle. Four ANN models were developed using the following accelerometer signal characteristics: 10 th, 25 th, 75 th, and 90 th percentiles; absolute deviation; coefficient of variability; and lag-one autocorrelation. The accuracy of the models was evaluated by leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Results: The models based on hip accelerometer data correctly classified the activities 72 % and 77 % of the time using uniaxial and triaxial accelerometer data, respectively, whereas the models based on ankle accelerometer data achieved a percentage of 57 % and 68 %. The hip models were better able to correctly classify the activities walking, rope skipping, and running, whereas the ankle models performed better when classifying sitting. The models based on triaxial accelerometer data produced a better classification of the activities <b>standing,</b> running, <b>rope</b> skipping, playing soccer, and cycling than its uniaxial counterparts. Conclusions: Applying ANN models to processing accelerometer data from children is promising for classifying common physical activities. The highest percentage of correctly classified activities was achieved when using triaxial accelerometer data from the hip. © 2011 by the American College of Sports Medicine...|$|R

Harmon peering {{over the side}} and Mrs. Paulhan and a companion waving in the Dominguez Air Meet, 1910. The basket holding the people is at center, and attached to it by strings is the balloon. George Harrison is <b>standing</b> inside the <b>ropes</b> connecting the balloon to the basket with his arms stretched out to the sides. There is an American flag billowing in the wind under the balloon, and a coiled rope is thrown {{over the side of}} the basket...|$|R
50|$|The attacking wrestler {{forces the}} {{opponent}} to ascend {{to the top}} <b>rope,</b> <b>standing</b> usually on the top ropes with their legs spread. The wrestler then bends the opponent, placing their head between the wrestler's thighs. The wrestler then wraps their hands around the opponent's waist. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up, flipping them over, while jumping forward. The opponent falls down to the mat back first, and the wrestler usually falls to their knees or to a sitting position. This variation was popularized as Chris Candido's Blonde Bombshell finisher.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{golf tournament}} player while a crowd is watching, ca. 1920. A golf player, in a {{position}} swing, is holding up a golf club over his shoulder. In the right background, a crowd of men in suits, can be seen <b>standing</b> behind a <b>rope</b> fence. In the center background, women can be seen sitting around a table under a large umbrella, which has undecipherable signs and imprints on it. To their left, another crowd of people is observable either sitting down or standing. All individuals are in well-dressed clothes and looking towards the same direction...|$|R
5000|$|On most occasions, {{one member}} of the team competes in the ring with one or more of his/her teammate(s) <b>standing</b> behind the <b>ropes.</b> Wrestlers switch {{positions}} by [...] "tagging" [...] one another, usually similar to a high five and, as a result, these teams are referred to as tag teams. This can create tension during the match as an injured wrestler {{in the middle of the}} ring attempts to reach his/her teammate(s), often with the heel team preventing them from doing so. In typical tag team matches, standard wrestling rules apply with a match ending by pinfall, submission, countout, or disqualification.|$|R
50|$|During his career, {{he lived}} in Visalia. In 1930, Carr claimed the Rodeo Association of America All-Around Cowboy championship, and was the winner of two season {{discipline}} championships, in the saddle bronc and steer roping categories. Carrs second All-Around Cowboy title came in 1933; two years later, he was gored by a bull at a rodeo in Visalia, suffering a perforation of his abdomen. Carr {{finished second in the}} 1936 Chicago rodeos combined bronc riding and calf <b>roping</b> <b>standings,</b> behind Lonnie Rooney. In 1940, he added a second steer roping championship. Carr was also a three-time champion of the California Rodeo, and appeared as a film actor in Westerns.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} inexpressibly sad in this. It seemed like {{standing at the}} death-bed of an old friend. The sea was still heaving violently; the gale, although moderated, was still pretty stiff, {{and the sun was}} setting in wild lurid clouds when the Foam rose for the last time-- every spar and <b>rope</b> <b>standing</b> out sharply against the sky. Then she bent forward slowly, as she overtopped a huge billow. Into the hollow she rushed. Like an expert diver she went down head foremost into the deep, and, next moment, those who had so lately trod her deck saw nothing around them save the lowering sky and the angry waters of the Pacific Ocean.|$|R
60|$|I {{think there}} has not been so much on a cricket match since the day when Sir Horace Mann walked about Broad Ha'penny agitatedly cutting down the daisies with his stick. And, be it remembered, the heroes of Hambledon played for money and renown only, while David was {{champion}} of a lady. A lady! May we not prettily say of two ladies? There were no spectators of our contest except now and again some loiterer in the Gardens who little thought what was the stake for which we played, but cannot we conceive Barbara <b>standing</b> at the <b>ropes</b> and agitatedly cutting down the daisies every time David missed the ball? I tell you, this was the historic match of the Gardens.|$|R
5000|$|The festival {{begins with}} men dressed in {{traditional}} Okinawan dress <b>standing</b> on the <b>rope</b> facing {{in opposite directions}} to symbolize the battle between East and West. A myriad of performances take place along the rope's length, from martial artists of varying ages, to older women performing a sort of fan-dance. It is an international event with Japanese nationals, American military, and tourists in attendance. Just {{before the start of}} the match a man dressed in the dress of the Ryūkyūan kings stands on a wooden platform hoisted in the air on the shoulders of men standing on opposite sides of the rope. The [...] "king" [...] is carried on this platform down the length of the rope, before the festival starts, and the two kings perform a ritual sword contest.|$|R
50|$|After {{holding the}} lead in the All-Around Cowboy standings late in the NFR, Cooper ended up in second place for the year, behind Dee Pickett. He did manage to win his fifth {{straight}} calf roping season championship. In steer roping, Cooper was unable to defend his 1983 season title; he was in seventh place before a win in the discipline at the NFR caused him to move up to fourth for the year. In 1985, Cooper wound up second in calf roping for the season, though he was the discipline's champion in the Winston Tour series. He won the Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo's all-around title in 1989, and by September 1990 was the PRCA's all-time leading money winner with career earnings of more than $1.1 million. Cooper was in sixth place in the 1990 PRCA steer <b>roping</b> <b>standings,</b> before breaking his left wrist and suffering a concussion in an automobile accident.|$|R
50|$|Wrap and Roll: A 50-foot {{platform}} is suspended 1,000 {{feet above the}} ground. Played in male/female pairs, the girls from each team have to advance {{from one of the}} platform to the middle, where their male partner will be <b>standing.</b> A 20-foot <b>rope</b> is attached to each partner, and the girls have to wrap themselves in the rope in order to advance toward their male partner, then the guys have to twirl around {{to the other end of}} the platform, and the process will repeat until each partner has advanced to the opposite end. Players are disqualified if they touch the rope with their hands, their rope makes contact with the platform or they exceed a 10-minute time limit. The team that completes the challenge in the fastest average time wins. Note: Since the Bad Asses team was short one male player, Derrick had to compete twice.|$|R
6000|$|I was {{too busy}} in getting in canvas to note the {{progress}} of the ship for the next twenty minutes. It took all four of us to stow the jib, leaving Michael at the wheel the while. And a tremendous job it was, though (I say it in humility) four better men never lay out on a spar, than those who set about the task on this occasion. We got it in, however, but, I need scarcely tell the seaman, it was not [...] "stowed in the skin." [...] Marble insisted on leading the party, and never before had I seen the old fellow work as he did on that day. He had a faculty of incorporating his body and limbs with the wood and <b>ropes,</b> <b>standing,</b> as it might be, on air, working and dragging with his arms and broad shoulders, in a way that appeared to give him just as much command of his entire strength, as another man would possess on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 40, {{while he}} was {{cleaning}} up the factory, he wondered how he could get all the old debris up to the upper levels of the factory. He had heard of hoisting platforms, but these often broke, and he was unwilling to take the risks. He and his sons, who were also tinkerers, designed their own [...] "safety elevator" [...] and tested it successfully. He initially thought so little of it he neither patented it nor requested a bonus from his superiors for it, nor did he try to sell it. After having made several sales, and after the bedstead factory declined, Otis {{took the opportunity to}} make an elevator company out of it, initially called Union Elevator Works and later Otis Brothers & Co..No orders came to him over the next several months, but soon after, the 1854 New York World's Fair offered a great chance at publicity. [...] At the New York Crystal Palace, Otis amazed a crowd when he ordered the only rope holding the platform on which he was <b>standing</b> cut. The <b>rope</b> was severed by an axeman, and the platform fell only a few inches before coming to a halt. The safety locking mechanism had worked, and people gained greater willingness to ride in traction elevators; these elevators quickly became the type in most common usage and helped make present-day skyscrapers possible.|$|R
60|$|It is {{difficult}} to say precisely why Jane did not wish to have Rollo go and ask the helmsman about the bell, but she had an instinctive feeling that it was better not to do it. So Rollo sat still. His attention was very soon turned away from the bell by Jane's calling out to him to see some sailors go up the rigging. There were regular shrouds, as they are called, that is, ladders formed of ropes, which led up {{on each side of the}} masts part way to where the sailors seemed to wish to go. Above the top of the shrouds there were only single ropes, and Rollo wondered what the sailors would do when they came to these. They found no difficulty, however, for when they reached the top of the shrouds they continued to mount by the ropes with very little apparent effort. They would take hold of two of the ropes that were a little distance apart with their hands, and then, curling their legs round them in a peculiar manner below, they would mount up very easily. They thus reached the yard, as it is called, which is a long, round beam, extending along the upper edge of the sail, and, spreading themselves out upon it in a row, they proceeded to do the work required upon the sail, leaning over upon the yard above, and <b>standing</b> upon a <b>rope,</b> which was stretched for the purpose along the whole length of it below.|$|R
