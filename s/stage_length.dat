500|$|The concert {{opened with}} a {{pre-recorded}} video montage showing black and white footage of gothic architecture as well as dancers dressed in white, marching across a <b>stage</b> <b>length</b> screen, preparing to crown Beyoncé who was dressed as a queen. The montage continued as female dancers wearing hoop-skirt cages and masks started appearing on stage. The video wall raised afterwards and a brief pyrotechnics display began as Beyoncé appeared onstage standing for several seconds prior {{to the performance of}} [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] preceded by an extended timpani interlude. She sang the song while performing a choreography which included a routine of faux kicking her male dancers. [...] "End of Time" [...] followed with Beyoncé dancing as fireworks were also displayed on stage. [...] "Flaws and All" [...] was performed as the third song on the set list with Beyoncé dedicating it to her fan group, the BeyHive. [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was mashed with The Verve's song [...] "Bitter Sweet Symphony" [...] taking the latter's string motif and incorporating several lines. [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] saw Beyoncé interacting with the audience through call and response, asking them to repeat [...] "Hey, Mrs. Carter". [...] "Baby Boy" [...] was performed against a holographic background as Beyoncé and several female dancers performed synchronised moves in front of the screen which flashed realistic images of more identical dancers. The singer concluded the song with a Dutty Wine dance {{at the end of the}} performance, before immediately continuing with [...] "Diva" [...] which was set to the groove of [...] "Clique". [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] was later performed into a neon strip-lit with a snippet of Donna Summer's [...] "Love to Love You Baby" [...] interpolated within it. Beyoncé also performed a seductive dance in front of an open fire display onstage. [...] "Party" [...] was performed after with a prominent Las Vegas showgirl theme. For [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] two ballerinas appeared on stage and performed a choreography along with a video projection on the screen. Beyoncé later appeared in a deep-plunging, thigh-high split long red dress performing the song along with her dancers.|$|E
50|$|Again, RASM {{comparisons}} across periods {{or across}} airlines {{also need to}} be made with care. All else being equal, revenue generally increases with average <b>stage</b> <b>length.</b> However, revenue generally does not increase as quickly as <b>stage</b> <b>length,</b> meaning that RASM typically decreases as average <b>stage</b> <b>length</b> increases.|$|E
50|$|All {{other things}} being equal, the same airline will have lower CASM, RASM and yield as <b>stage</b> <b>length</b> increases, since fixed costs are spread over {{increasingly}} larger average flight lengths. Therefore, to properly compare these quantities across airlines (or even across the same airline for two different periods if the airline's average <b>stage</b> <b>length</b> has changed significantly) requires settling on a common assumed <b>stage</b> <b>length</b> and then adjusting CASM, RASM and yield appropriately. This requires some judgment and different observers may use different stage-length adjustment techniques. A common method, for instance, would {{be looking at a}} detailed cost breakdown of a particular airline and deciding whether each cost category varies with <b>stage</b> <b>length,</b> and how.|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{applications of}} active controls are examined {{for improving the}} characteristics of transport type aircraft used in short-haul service (1, 000 -kilometer range capability). The types of aircraft to meet future needs (quiet operation, congestion alleviation, fuel conservation, operating economy, and traveler acceptance) are identified as helicopters for shorter <b>stage</b> <b>lengths</b> and fixed wing aircraft of reduced field-length capability for longer <b>stage</b> <b>lengths.</b> Likely uses for active controls for these aircraft are examined regarding payoffs which can be expected and problems and constraints which must be dealt with. Uses showing significant benefits include augmented stability and control, gust-load alleviation, and ride smoothing. Gust-load alleviation is particularly effective for low-wing-loading aircraft employing conventional lift. Ride-smoothing systems are indicated to be the furthest advanced and ready for production commitment for those applications {{where they can be}} shown to have payoff...|$|R

50|$|CASM (or CASK) is a {{commonly}} used measure of unit cost {{in the airline}} industry. CASM is expressed in cents to operate each seat mile offered, and is determined by dividing operating costs by ASMs. This number is frequently used to allow a cost comparison between different airlines or for the same airline across different time periods (say for one year vs the preceding year). A lower CASM means that {{it is easier for}} the airline to make a profit, as they have to charge less to break even. A low CASM, however, {{is by no means a}} guarantee of profitability. Further, CASM should only be compared across airlines with care. For instance, all other things being equal, an airline with a longer average <b>stage</b> <b>length</b> will have a lower CASM, because fixed costs will account for a lower portion of its total costs. For this reason, to be meaningful, CASM comparisons across different airlines generally require, at a minimum, that CASMs for all airlines be adjusted to a common <b>stage</b> <b>length,</b> or that the CASMs be graphed versus the <b>stage</b> <b>length</b> of all the airlines being compared.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{interest}} in the air bus conception of air travel {{is reflected in the}} aircraft chosen for study by the students in the Department of Aircraft Design during the 1963 and 1965 academic years. The first study was based upon the use of four propeller turbine engines to power an aircraft capable of carrying up to 40, 000 lb. of payload over short <b>stage</b> <b>lengths.</b> Emphasis was placed on the need for operations with mixed passenger and freight loads and the fuselage layout incorporates two decks, the lower one of which is designed as a freighthold with nose loading doors. The second study was similar except that four wing mounted pure jet engines replaced the propeller turbines of the earlier design. The cruising speed is thus some 50 per cent higher with a Mach number limitation of 0. 8. The two deck fuselage layout is retained, but with a rear loading door for the freighthold, and the wing has 28 ° of leading edge sweepback. An initial economic comparison of the two aircraft revealed that when the aircraft are operated over 250 n. mile <b>stage</b> <b>lengths</b> the direct operating costs of the propeller turbine powered design are some 20 per cent less than those of the pure jet version. This is mainly due to the much lower first cost of the simpler aircraft...|$|R
