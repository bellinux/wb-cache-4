40|$|AbstractPavement <b>surface</b> <b>performances</b> {{have a great}} {{influence}} on road functionality and can affect user's safety, vehicle operational costs, environmental sustainability. The assessment of evolution of pavement <b>surface</b> <b>performance</b> plays {{a fundamental role in}} road pavement management and is useful in order to allocation of maintenance resources. In the light of the above, Authors introduced the first results carried out from a two-year monitoring of an experimental road section.

40|$|Micro-scale surface textures {{have found}} {{profound}} application in various industrial sectors, including the biomedical and tribological communities. While numerous manufacturing methods {{are available for}} the fabrication of these micro-features, advancements in high-precision machinery and piezoelectric actuation have allowed {{for the development of}} new and scalable processes for mechanical surface texturing based on modulation-assisted machining. The present study aims to understand the effects of micro-scale surface textures produced by modulation-assisted machining on <b>surface</b> <b>performance</b> in biomedical and tribological configurations. To accomplish this, a predictive geometric model was developed to simulate surfaces generated in multiple mechanical texturing orientations. Experimental studies were carried out to generate controlled surface textures over a range of characteristics in terms of feature size and morphology. The <b>surface</b> <b>performance</b> of the resulting textures in a biomedical implant application were tested for osseointegration capability with in vivo and in vitro tests. For these tests, a bilateral rat tibia model and precursor osteoblast MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cell culture were used, respectively. <b>Surface</b> <b>performance</b> of the micro-scale surface textures in a tribological application was evaluated using a pin-on-disk wear testing configuration. The results of both studies show promising findings that demonstrate the beneficial effects of surface textures produced by modulation-assisted machining. M. S...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, boronizing coating was {{produced}} by pack cementation to improve the <b>surface</b> <b>performance</b> and increase the usage lifetime of P 110 oil casing tube steel during operation. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and glow discharge optical emission spectroscope (GDOES) were used to investigate the surface morphology, cross-sectional microstructure, phase constitutions and element distribution of the boronizing coating. The wear and corrosion resistance of boronizing coating and P 110 steel were evaluated on high speed reciprocating friction tester and electrochemical workstation, respectively. The {{results showed that the}} obtained coating was uniform and continuous, mainly consisted of Fe 2 B and reached a thickness of 20 μm. The the wear and corrosion resistance of the P 110 steel can be improved by boronizing coating. In conclusion, the formed coating has significantly improved the <b>surface</b> <b>performance</b> of P 110 steel...|$|R
