40|$|Nucleation is {{the first}} step in {{granulation}} where the powder and liquid first contact. Two types of nucleation in wet granulation processes are proposed. Drop controlled nucleation, where one drop forms one nucleus, occurs when drops hitting the powder surface do not overlap (low <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> Psi(a)) and the drop must wet quickly into the bed (short drop penetration time t(p)). If either criterion is not met, powder mixing characteristics will dominate (mechanical dispersion regime). Granulation experiments were performed with lactose powder, water, PEG 200, and 7 % HPC solution in a 6 L and a 25 L mixer granulator. Size distributions were measured as the drop penetration time and <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> were varied. At short penetration times, decreasing Psi(a) caused the nuclei distribution to become narrower. When drop penetration time was high, the nuclei size distribution was broad independent of changes in dimensionless <b>spray</b> <b>flux.</b> Nucleation regime maps were plotted for each set of experiments in each mixer as a function of the dimensionless distribution width delta. The nucleation regime map demonstrates the interaction between drop penetration time and <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> in nucleation.

40|$|This study investigates binder {{distribution}} in wet granulation {{and focuses on}} the nucleation zone, which is {{the area where the}} liquid binder and powder surface come into contact and form the initial nuclei. An equipment independent parameter, dimensionless <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> Psi (a), is defined to characterise the most important process parameters in the nucleation process: solution flowrate, powder flux, and binder drop size. Ex-granulator experiments are used to study the relationship between dimensionless <b>spray</b> <b>flux,</b> process variables and the coverage of binder fluid on the powder surface. Lactose monohydrate powder on a variable speed riffler passed under a flat spray once only. Water and 7 % HPC solution at two spray pressures were used as binders. Experiments with red dye and image analysis demonstrate that changes in dimensionless <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> correlate with a measurable difference in powder surface coverage. Nucleation experiments show that <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> controls {{the size and shape of}} the nuclei size distribution. At low Psi (a), the system operates in the drop controlled regime, where one drop forms one nucleus and the nuclei size distribution is narrow. At higher Psi (a), the powder surface cakes creating a broader size distribution. For controlled nucleation with the narrowest possible size distribution, it is recommended that the dimensionless <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> be less than 0. 1 to be in the drop-controlled regime.

Similarly, fog and precipitation at sea level may contribute to the phenomenon of sea spray containing water droplets of minuscule sizes. Wind characteristics (speed and direction) also has a direct influence on the speed of water droplets as well their sizes. It has been found that sea <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> is directly responsible for icing over marine structures, such as offshore oil rigs and ships. Therefore, it is of importance to devise a mechanism to measure sea <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> with more accuracy.

Once the 10 -m wind speed over the ocean reaches approximately 11 – 13 m s 1, the spray sensible and latent heat fluxes become significant fractions (i. e., 10 % or greater) of the corresponding interfacial fluxes. The analysis here establishes that result by combining the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean– Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) version 2. 6 bulk interfacial flux algorithm with a micro-physical spray model to partition measured heat fluxes from two good high-wind datasets into <b>spray</b> and interfacial <b>flux</b> contributions. The measurements come from the Humidity Exchange over the Sea (HEXOS) experiment and the Fronts and Atlantic Storm-Tracks Experiment (FASTEX); wind speeds in these two datasets span 5 to 20 m s 1.

40|$|Dimensionless <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> Ψa is a {{dimensionless}} group that characterises {{the three most}} important variables in liquid dispersion: flowrate, drop size and powder <b>flux</b> through the <b>spray</b> zone. In this paper, the Poisson distribution was used to generate analytical solutions for the proportion of nuclei formed from single drops (fsingle) and the fraction of the powder surface covered by drops (fcovered) as a function of Ψa. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to simulate the spray zone and investigate how Ψa, fsingle and fcovered are related. The Monte-Carlo data was an excellent match with analytical solutions of fcovered and fsingle as a function of Ψa. At low Ψa, the proportion of the surface covered by drops (fcovered) was equal to Ψa. As Ψa increases, drop overlap becomes more dominant and the powder surface coverage levels off. The proportion of nuclei formed from single drops (fsingle) falls exponentially with increasing Ψa. In the ranges covered, these results were independent of drop size, number of drops, drop size distribution (mono-sized, bimodal and trimodal distributions), and the uniformity of the spray. Experimental data of nuclei size distributions as a function of <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> were fitted to the analytical solution for fsingle by defining a cutsize for single drop nuclei. The fitted cutsizes followed the spray drop sizes suggesting that the method is robust and that the cutsize does indicate the transition size between single drop and agglomerate nuclei.

More specifically, present study aims to discern the role ocean surface waves and sea spray play in modulating the intensity and structure of a tropical cyclone (TC). To investigate the effects of ocean surface waves and sea spray, numerical simulations were carried out using a coupled atmosphere–wave model where a sea spray microphysical model was incorporated within the coupled model. Furthermore, this study also explores how sea spray generation can be modelled using wave energy dissipation due to whitecaps, where whitecaps are considered as the primary mode of spray droplets generation at hurricane intensity wind speeds.

40|$|Oil and gas {{activities}} in the cold seas are endangered by icing. Icing may occur when water spray or moisture is deposited on a vessel or offshore structure above sea level and the air temperatures is below the freezing temperature of water. Ice accumulation can block rescue equipment and doors, and clog ventilation systems, which may {{increase the risk of}} explosion as result of volatile gas accumulation. Icing can be caused by supercooled fog, freezing rain, falling snow and freezing sea spray. The freezing sea spray caused 80 – 90 % of all offshore icing incidents and is the focus of this study. To take precautions against icing, {{it is important to understand}} the physics of icing and to model it. The rate of ice accretion is mainly defined by the <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> and heat transfer, and both must be accurately predicted. Existing icing models, e. g., ICEMOD and RIGICE 04, simplify the structure, subdividing it into cylindrical and flat components. In these models, airflow around a component is assumed to be unaffected by other parts of the structure, and the heat transfer is approximated using empirical relations. In reality, however, the airflow field is complex. Upwind components can create wind shadow regions or regions of accelerated flow in front of downwind components; this changes both the <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> and the heat transfer, thus making ICEMOD and RIGICE 04 inadequate. A research subject of this PhD study was the heat transfer and spray flow around a structure in a real airflow. The full-scale measurements in the literature are limited and it is expensive to perform them. Therefore, for a preliminary answer the question was addressed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which is capable of predicting the spray flow and heat transfer around a structure with any shape; however, the accuracy of CFD is uncertain. Existing models of sea spray icing, e. g., ICEMOD and RIGICE 04, neglect heat flux into the accreted ice and assume that air cooling is directly spent to freeze the water film on the ice surface. This assumption is good for steady ice growth. However, it is also used in modelling icing caused by periodic sea spray. This study proves numerically and experimentally that the heat flux into the accreted ice generated by freezing must not be neglected. The main contributions of this work are as follows: The study develops the marine icing model, MARICE, which uses CFD to calculate <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> and heat transfer, and models water film motion on any arbitrary surface. · The study shows that Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models should be used with care in icing simulations: the collision efficiency is well predicted upstream flow separation point by any RANS turbulence model; however, the wake and separation of the flow is modelled poorly. · The study develops and validates a new model of ice growth caused by periodic sea spray, which accounts for the heat conduction inside the accreted ice...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} the wet {{agglomeration}} processes of powders depends on the combined contribution of native powders characteristics, energy input, and wetting liquid binder. The objective of this work is to specifically investigate {{the contribution of the}} size distribution (d 50 and span) of the native particles, on the dimensional and structural characteristics of the agglomerates. Experiments are performed with native semolina particles. The agglomeration process is conducted using water as liquid binder. Several fractions of native semolina with contrasted dimensional properties (d 50 and span) are prepared by a sieving procedure. The wet granulation is processed under specific conditions using a low shear granulator at constant blade speed, product load, liquid spraying condition (constant dimensionless <b>spray</b> <b>flux)</b> and residence time. The agglomerates properties are evaluated by the distribution of the measured values of the size, water content and compactness. The mean values and their fluctuations are both taken into account to describe the agglomeration mechanisms. Whatever the size distribution of the native powder, the mechanisms involved in the agglomeration process are the same but with different importances especially the breakage of agglomerates. We observed specific effects of the span and the median diameter of native powders on the size distribution of the agglomerates. Using small native particles (d 50 < 250 μm) improves the homogeneity of the size distribution of the agglomerate bed. Using slightly dispersed native particles (span < 1. 0) leads to a better uniformity on the size distribution. We demonstrate that the conditions to obtain a population of agglomerates with a narrow size distribution depend on the ratio between the water droplet diameter (d 50 drop ~ 250 μm), and the median diameter of the native particles. This diameter ratio is considered as a process parameter. We propose to build a modified dimensionless <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> number by incorporating this diameter ratio.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to develop a}} nucleation regime map to determine the controlling nucleation mechanism as a function of material properties and operating parameters. Two distinct regimes of nucleation were identified. The drop controlled nucleation regime occurs when nucleation conditions are ideal and one drop produces one nucleus granule and the controlling property is the droplet size. The nuclei formation kinetics are fast and the binder droplets penetrate into the powder bed pores almost immediately. In this region, the nuclei distribution reflects the drop size distribution as one drop tends to form one granule provided that (a) drops hitting the powder surface do not overlap - low <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> Ya and (b) the drop must wet into the bed completely before bed mixing brings it into contact with another partially absorbed drop on the bed surface - low penetration time tp. If either criterion is not met, powder mixing characteristics will dominate. In the mechanical dispersion regime, the viscous or poorly wetting binder is slow to flow through the powder pores and form nuclei and good mixing is required for binder dispersion. The kinetics of nuclei formation were characterised using a simple drop penetration time test. A single drop of binder fluid was placed on a loosely packed powder bed and the time taken for the fluid to penetrate completely was measured for a range of powder and binder combinations. Loosely packed powder beds contain large macrovoids which are included in the existing Kozeny approach to estimating pore size. However it was found that these pores do not participate in liquid flow. A new two phase model was proposed where the total volume of the macrovoids was assumed to be the difference between the bed porosity and the tap porosity. A new parameter, the effective porosity eeff, was defined as the tap porosity multiplied by the estimated fraction of pores that terminate at a macrovoid and are effectively blocked pores. The pore sizes and drop penetration times were recalculated using the effective porosity and the predicted tp values were generally within an order of magnitude of the experimental results for all powders. The drop penetration time is reduced by small drops, low viscosity fluids, porous powders (but without macrovoids), large powder pores, high surface tension, low contact angle and pre-wetting of the powder bed. A new dimensionless group, the dimensionless <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> Ya was defined to characterise the three most important operating variables in binder dispersion: liquid binder flowrate, drop size and powder <b>flux</b> through the <b>spray</b> zone. At low Ya, the majority of drops land on the powder sufficiently well separated to allow ideal drop controlled nucleation where one drop forms one granule. As Ya increases, the probability of drop footprints overlapping to give larger agglomerate nuclei increases. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to validate the <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> theory. The proportion of nuclei formed from single drops falls exponentially as Ya increases and to remain in the drop controlled regime Ya must be kept below 0. 1. Analytical solutions based on the Poisson distribution for the fraction of single drop nuclei as a function of Ya were an excellent match with the Monte-Carlo data. Further validation experiments in carefully designed ex-granulator experiments and in an industrial granulator were performed. The results matched the theoretical solutions and demonstrated the ability of Ya to describe the nucleation zone in a real granulator. The proposed nucleation regime map demonstrated the interaction between drop penetration time and <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> in nucleation. At short penetration times, such as the water and lactose system, decreasing Ya causes a shift towards the drop controlled regime and a narrower nuclei distribution. When penetration time is long, the nuclei size distribution is always larger and broader. Granulation may still be successful if the mechanical dispersion forces are able to break up the binder clumps and distribute the binder through the powder. The nucleation regime map should prove to be a useful tool for maintaining effective liquid distribution during scale-up as well as a useful trouble-shooting tool. It allows the dominant mechanism controlling the nucleation process to be easily identified using relatively simple parameters and a rational approach can then be used to control the properties of the nuclei...|$|R

The change in cloud drop concentrations causes an increase in cloud reflectivity and a summertime radiative forcing between at 50 and 65 degrees S comparable in magnitude but acting against that from greenhouse gas forcing over the same time period, and thus represents a substantial negative climate feedback.

Initial results show the increase of the sea <b>spray</b> <b>fluxes</b> with wind speed u, roughly varying as u 3 for u up to 16 ms−...|$|R
40|$|The lowest surface {{temperature}} {{possible for the}} existance of spray evaporative cooling is determined experimentally to be a linear function of the impinging <b>spray</b> mass <b>flux.</b> A conduction-controlled analytical model of droplet evaporation gives fairly good agreement with experimental measurements at atmospheric pressure. At reduced pressures droplet evaporation rates are decreased significantly such that an optimum operating pressure exists for each desired surface heat flux. The initiation of the 'Leidenfrost state' provides the upper {{surface temperature}} bound for spray evaporative cooling...|$|R
40|$|This note {{provides}} {{estimates of}} the mean sea <b>spray</b> aerosol <b>flux</b> based on long-term wave statistics using the whitecap method based on the limiting steepness and threshold vertical acceleration criteria. The aim is to present a procedure demonstrating how global wave statistics {{can be used to}} give {{estimates of the}} long-term aerosol flux. These estimates are obtained by using bivariate distributions of significant wave height and characteristic wave period, representing open ocean deep water waves in the Northern North Sea and the North Atlantic...|$|R
40|$|Field {{measurements}} of spray drift are usually {{carried out by}} passive collectors and tracers. However, these methods are labour- and time-intensive and only provide point- and time-integrated measurements. Unlike these methods, the {{light detection and ranging}} (lidar) technique allows real-time measurements, obtaining information with temporal and spatial resolution. Recently, the authors have developed the first eye-safe lidar system specifically designed for spray drift monitoring. This prototype is based on a 1534 erbium-doped glass laser and an 80 mm diameter telescope, has scanning capability, and is easily transportable. This paper presents the results of the first experimental campaign carried out with this instrument. High coefficient of determination (R 2 > 0. 85) were observed by comparing lidar {{measurements of}} the spray drift with those obtained by horizontal collectors. Furthermore, the lidar system allowed an assessment of the drift reduction potential (DRP) when comparing low-drift nozzles with standard ones, resulting in a DRP of 57 %(preliminaryresult) for the tested nozzles. The lidar system was also used for monitoring the evolution of the <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> over the canopy and to generate 2 -D images of these plumes. The developed instrument is an advantageous alternative to passive collectors and opens the possibility of new methods for field measurement of spray drift.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to investigate process variables affecting weight gain mass coating variability (CVm) in pan coating devices using novel video-imaging techniques and Monte Carlo simulations. Experimental information such as the tablet location, circulation time distribution, velocity distribution, projected surface area, and spray dynamics was the main input to the simulations. The data on the dynamics of tablet movement were obtained using novel video-imaging methods. The effects of pan speed, pan loading, tablet size, coating time, <b>spray</b> <b>flux</b> distribution, and <b>spray</b> area and shape were investigated. CVm was found to be inversely proportional to the square root of coating time. The spray shape was not found to affect the CVm of the process significantly, but an increase in the spray area led to lower CVms. Coating experiments were conducted to verify the predictions from the Monte Carlo simulations, and the trends predicted from the model were in good agreement. It was observed that the Monte Carlo simulations underpredicted CVms in comparison to the experiments. The model developed can provide a basis for adjustments in process parameters required during scale-up operations and can be useful in predicting the process changes that are needed to achieve the same CVm when a variable is altered...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} studies of the {{vertical}} gradient of aerosol concentration measurements made during cruises of r/v ‘Oceania’ between 2008 and 2012 are presented. Using the results from those experiments, sea <b>spray</b> emission <b>fluxes</b> were calculated for all particles of sizes {{in the range from}} 0. 5 μm to 8 μm, as well as for particles of sizes from fifteen channels of 0. 5 μm width.

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} turbulent {{model is}} used to investigate the effect of sea <b>spray</b> mediated turbulent <b>fluxes</b> on upper ocean temperature during the passage of typhoon Yagi over the Kuroshio Extension area in 2006. Both a macroscopical sea <b>spray</b> momentum <b>flux</b> algorithm and a microphysical heat and moisture flux algorithm are included in this turbulent model. Numerical {{results show that the}} model can well reproduce the upper ocean temperature, which is consistent with the data from the Kuroshio Extension Observatory. Besides, the sea surface temperature is decreased by about 0. 5 °C during the typhoon passage, which also agrees with the sea surface temperature dataset derived from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing and Reynolds. Diagnostic analysis indicates that sea spray acts as an additional source of the air-sea turbulent fluxes and {{plays a key role in}} increasing the turbulent kinetic energy in the upper ocean, which enhances the temperature diffusion there. Therefore, sea spray is also an important factor in determining the upper mixed layer depth during the typhoon passage...|$|R
