Two ways to describe these {{matching rules}} are shown in {{the image on the}} right.

5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, <b>such</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E
40|$|Several {{fundamental}} problems in Computational Geometry {{come from the}} field of Facility Location. In this paper we consider some problems <b>that</b> belong to <b>the</b> interplay between these two areas. Given a set S of points in the plane: (1) find a polygonal chain with one corner belonging to S <b>such</b> <b>that</b> minimizes <b>the</b> maximum distance, (2) find a polygonal chain with k corners belonging to S <b>such</b> <b>that</b> minimizes <b>the</b> maximum distance, (3) find a polygonal chains with constrained length <b>such</b> <b>that</b> minimizes <b>the</b> maximum distance.

5|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that measures}} {{the quality of}} a book embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its pagewidth. This is the maximum number of edges that can be crossed by a ray perpendicular to the spine within a single page. Equivalently (for book embeddings in which each edge is drawn as a monotonic curve), it is the maximum size of a subset of edges within a single page <b>such</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> intervals defined on the spine by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.|$|E
5|$|At the back, the nasals are {{separated}} by the frontal in K. langenbergensis, the back third of which is somewhat vaulted. The portion of the frontal between the eyes is one-third {{the width of the}} entire skull in both species, but it widens further back to form the front of the skull roof. The prefrontal is straight along its contact with the frontal and nasal (about half of the bone is in contact with each), but forms an angle between the margin of the eye socket and the lacrimal on the other side. This angle is rounded in K. guimarotae <b>such</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bone is oval-shaped, but very pointed in K. langenbergensis <b>such</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bone is triangular.|$|E
5|$|Consonant {{clusters}} across syllable boundaries do not assimilate {{for place}} in Wagiman {{as they do}} in many other languages. This means that a nasal in a syllable coda will not move to the position of the following syllable onset for ease of enunciation. In English and most other Indo-European languages, this movement occurs regularly, <b>such</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prefix -in, for example, changes to -im when it precedes either a p, a b or an m.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Newton (1687) refined van Roomen's solution, so {{that the}} solution-circle centers were located at the intersections of a line with a circle. Newton formulates Apollonius' problem as a problem in trilateration: to locate a point Z from three given points A, B and C, <b>such</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{differences}} in distances from Z to the three given points have known values.

5|$|The {{cooperative}} Spartan Ops mode originally {{began as}} a Firefight-type mode, similar to that featured in Halo: Reach, but was composed of different objective-oriented mission types. Over the course of development, changes were made to Spartan Ops to include a narrative that would tie Halo 4s multiplayer together. The missions were designed primarily for four player co-op. The Spartan Ops development team worked with the narrative team to use ideas and storylines to shape the mode <b>such</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cinematics would tie in with the missions.|$|E
