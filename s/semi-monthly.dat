5|$|The visual {{novel was}} well {{received}} whereas the first anime adaptation received mixed reviews. Across the national <b>semi-monthly</b> ranking of bishōjo games in amount sold in Japan, the limited edition of Shuffle! premiered {{in second place}} {{at the time of}} its release and remained in the top 50 for an additional three and a half-months. The normal edition premiered in ninth place {{at the time of its}} release and remained in the top 50 for an additional three half-months. Critics of the anime series were divided between whether or not the anime series set itself apart from other series in the harem genre and as to the quality of its audio and visual aspects.|$|E

Shuffle! was released at {{around the same time}} as Fate/stay night, a highly anticipated visual novel by Type-Moon. The limited edition of Shuffle! was the second highest-selling computer game for the last two weeks of January 2004 the top 50 best-selling Bishōjo games <b>semi-monthly</b> sales chart in Japan, behind Fate/stay night.

5|$|The {{winter of}} 1906–07 was the coldest in Alberta history; this was {{exacerbated}} by {{a shortage of}} coal. One cause of this shortage was the strained relationship between coal miners and mine operators in the province. At the beginning of April 1907 the Canada West Coal and Coke Company locked out the miners from its mine near Taber. The same company was also facing a work stoppage at its mine in the Crow's Nest Pass, where miners were refusing to sign a new contract. The problem spread, until by April 22 all 3,400 miners working for member-companies of the Western Coal Operators' Association were off work. Miners' demands included increased wages, a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and <b>semi-monthly</b> rather than monthly pay; the mine operators objected to this last point {{on the basis that}} many miners did not report to work the day after payday, and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum.|$|E

500|$|In 1907, Sifton was {{one member}} of a three-member {{commission}} assigned to investigate labour unrest between coal miners and mine operators. [...] His colleagues were mining executive Lewis Stockett and miners' union executive William Haysom. [...] Miners' demands included increased wages, a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and <b>semi-monthly</b> rather than monthly pay. [...] The mine operators objected to this last point {{on the basis that}} many miners did not report to work the day after payday, and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum. [...] The commission recommended that children under sixteen {{should not be allowed to}} work in mines, that inspectors should post their reports, that mine sites should have bath houses, and that ventilation inspection should be improved. It also recommended that Albertans keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use. The commission was silent on wages (except to say that these should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of company stores (a sore point among the miners), and the incorporation of mine unions (which was recommended by mines but opposed by the unions). It made no recommendation about working hours, but Premier Alexander Rutherford's government legislated an eight-hour day anyway.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first modern}} report of sickle-cell disease {{may have been}} in 1846, where the autopsy of an {{executed}} runaway slave was discussed; the key findings was the absence of the spleen. There were also reports amongst African slaves in the United States exhibiting resistance to malaria but being prone to leg ulcers. The abnormal characteristics of the red blood cells, which later lent their name to the condition, was first described by Ernest E. Irons (1877–1959), intern to the Chicago cardiologist and professor of medicine James B. Herrick (1861–1954), in 1910. Irons saw [...] "peculiar elongated and sickle-shaped" [...] cells in the blood of a man named Walter Clement Noel, a 20-year-old first-year dental student from Grenada. Noel had been admitted to the Chicago Presbyterian Hospital in December 1904 suffering from anaemia. Noel was readmitted several times {{over the next three years}} for [...] "muscular rheumatism" [...] and [...] "bilious attacks" [...] but completed his studies and returned to the capital of Grenada (St. George's) to practice dentistry. He died of pneumonia in 1916 and is buried in the Catholic cemetery at Sauteurs in the north of Grenada. Shortly after the report by Herrick, another case appeared in the Virginia Medical <b>Semi-Monthly</b> with the same title, [...] "Peculiar Elongated and Sickle-Shaped Red Blood Corpuscles in a Case of Severe Anemia." [...] This article is based on a patient admitted to the University of Virginia Hospital on November 15, 1910. [...] In the later description by Verne Mason in 1922, the name [...] "sickle cell anemia" [...] is first used. Childhood problems related to sickle cells disease were not reported until the 1930s, despite the fact that this cannot have been uncommon in African-American populations.|$|E
2500|$|Lilian Garcia would {{depart from}} the WWE yet again on August 1, 2016 due to {{personal}} reasons as her departure would officially leave a brand new generation of WWE female talents. Nikki Bella returned from a legitimate injury at SummerSlam in a six woman tag team match. The WWE SmackDown Women's Championship was introduced on the August 23, 2016 episode of SmackDown, when SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan and Commissioner Shane McMahon announced the creation of the championship, a SmackDown women's exclusive title and announced that the inaugural champion would be determined at Backlash in a six-pack challenge between Alexa Bliss, Becky Lynch, Carmella, Naomi, Natalya, and Nikki Bella, where Becky Lynch became the inaugural champion. Most of the year of 2016 saw Charlotte and Sasha Banks feuding and trading the WWE Raw Women's Championship including main eventing Raw twice (one in a Falls Count Anywhere match to be contested between women since 2007) since Trish Stratus & Lita in December 2004, for the Women's Championship, competing in the first ever female Hell in a Cell match in WWE history at Hell in a Cell, also the championship was revealed to be the main event of the pay-per-view, marking the first time a women's match would headline a WWE pay-per-view event. Mickie James would return to WWE in a one night only match when it was announced by the company in late October 2016 that she would compete against title holder, Asuka for the NXT Women's Championship in the developmental territory's <b>semi-monthly</b> [...] event. On the November 29 edition of SmackDown Live, it was announced that Becky Lynch would defend the SmackDown Women's title against Alexa Bliss at [...] in the second female tables match since 2010, where Bliss defeated Lynch to become new champion.|$|E
6000|$|Cooper owned no copy of Tales for Fifteen; but the {{resourceful}} publisher found a copy in New York, and [...] "Imagination" [...] filled {{almost the}} whole of the front page (approximately 60 by 34-1/2 inches) of the Boston Notion on 30 January 1841. It was reprinted in what was apparently a second edition of Roberts' <b>Semi-Monthly</b> Magazine for 1 and 15 February 1841 and in London in William Hazlitt's Romanticist and Novelist's Library. A subsequent request brought permission for the reprinting of [...] "Heart," [...] which appeared in the Boston Notion for 13 and 20 March 1841 and in Roberts' <b>Semi-Monthly</b> Magazine for 1 and 15 April 1841. Roberts expressed his gratitude by defending Cooper in his paper from the charge of aristocratic bias which some New York journalists had brought against Home As Found. Doubtless the publisher would have been pleased to find other American writers sufficiently democratic to provide free copy.|$|E

This is greatly to be regretted, and I do {{not hesitate to}} recommend the authorization of a renewal of that contract, and also that the service may be increased from monthly to <b>semi-monthly</b> trips.

6000|$|When Cooper {{permitted}} [...] "Imagination" [...] and [...] "Heart" [...] to be {{reprinted in}} 1841, he was again conferring a favor on a publisher. Towards {{the close of}} 1840 George Roberts, publisher and proprietor of the Boston Notion, subtitled without exaggeration [...] "The Mammoth Sheet of the World," [...] sent Cooper a circular letter in {{the hand of a}} clerk to request a short contribution suitable for his new publication, Roberts' <b>Semi-Monthly</b> Magazine. Normally, Cooper refused all such requests: but he was under the erroneous impression that Roberts had forwarded to him some Danish translations of his works which Longfellow had sent to America for him a few years before. Remembering these early stories, he replied to Roberts on 2 January 1841: [...] "Some fifteen or twenty years since my publisher became embarrassed, and I wrote two short tales to aid him. He printed them, under the title of Tales for Fifteen, by Jane Morgan. One of these stories, rather a feeble one I fear, was called Heart--the other Imagination. This tale was written one rainy day, half asleep and half awake, but I retain rather a favorable impression of it. If you can find a copy of the book, you might think Imagination worth reprinting, and I suppose there can now be no objection to it. It would have the freshness of novelty, and would be American enough, Heaven knows. It would fill three or four of your columns." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{some distant}} business, with a farmer-tenant, {{he had been}} absent from the mansion during {{the best part of}} the day, and had but just come home, early of a {{pleasant}} moonlight evening, when Dates delivered a message to him from his mother, begging him to come for her about half-past seven that night to Miss Llanyllyn's cottage, in order to accompany her thence to that of the two Miss Pennies. At the mention of that last name, Pierre well knew what he must anticipate. Those elderly and truly pious spinsters, gifted with the most benevolent hearts in the world, and at mid-age deprived by envious nature of their hearing, seemed to have made it a maxim of their charitable lives, that since God had not given them any more the power to hear Christ's gospel preached, they would therefore thenceforth do what they could toward practicing it. Wherefore, as a matter of no possible interest to them now, they abstained from church; and while with prayer-books in their hands the Rev. Mr. Falsgrave's congregation were engaged in worshiping their God, according to the divine behest; the two Miss Pennies, with thread and needle, were hard at work in serving him; making up shirts and gowns for the poor people of the parish. Pierre had heard that they had recently been at the trouble of organizing a regular society, among the neighboring farmers' wives and daughters, to meet twice a month at their own house (the Miss Pennies) for the purpose of sewing in concert for the benefit of various settlements of necessitous emigrants, who had lately pitched their populous shanties further up the river. But though this enterprise had not been started without previously acquainting Mrs. Glendinning of it,--for indeed she was much loved and honored by the pious spinsters,--and their promise of solid assistance from that gracious manorial lady; yet Pierre had not heard that his mother had been officially invited to preside, or be at all present at the <b>semi-monthly</b> meetings; though he supposed, that far from having any scruples against so doing, she would be very glad to associate that way, with the good people of the village.|$|E
