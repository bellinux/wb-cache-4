40|$|Machine vision offers {{advantages}} for robot motion control {{and performance of}} the system with visual feedback. Fundamental machine vision algorithms were studied and experiments of applying visual feedback in positioning of a pneumatic <b>servo-cylinder</b> were also undertaken and compared. Performance regarding control accuracy and frequency response of the system was investigated and issues of performance degradation established...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{possibility}} of a uses control system with a signal processor DSP to control hydrostatic transmission was described. A hydrostatic transmission with pump variable efficiency and engine radial with constant working absorptivity was chosen. The control of the efficiency of pump was realized by using the electrohydraulic control system. This hydraulic system consists of a <b>servo-cylinder</b> and electrohydraulic servovalve. Such an object {{is one of the most}} important parts of working machines. Because the object is nonlinear and not time invariant its control is very difficult. In the last few years using the signal processor DSP for control has become very popular. In this paper the use of cascade controllers in DSP was described. The cascade controllers realize control of the position of the <b>servo-cylinder</b> and the control of the rotational speed of the hydraulic engine To chose the controllerÂ’s parameters the simulation model adopted in Matlab/Simulink was used. The object used parameters from simulation tests. Many different tests were conducted on a laboratory hydrostatic transmission...|$|E
