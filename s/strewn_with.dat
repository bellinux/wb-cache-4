5|$|Steep and <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> rapids, the Kootenay, {{despite being}} {{unsuitable}} for commercial transportation of agricultural and mineral products, {{is considered an}} outstanding whitewater river. Whitewater rafting is popular on the Kootenay in two stretches: in Jennings Canyon between the Libby Dam in Montana and Bonners Ferry in Idaho, and in {{the upper reaches of}} the river in Kootenay National Park in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|At 2pm on Wednesday, March 21, the Spray {{collided}} with the Lucinda four miles north of Barnegat, New Jersey, knocking {{a hole in the}} Sprays bow that resulted in her filling with water; the Lucinda also sustained damage. Capt. Willis of the Lucinda saw no one other than Jackalow (whom he blamed for the collision) on board the Spray, and Jackalow refused to be rescued and taken aboard the Lucinda. Willis observed that the deck of the Spray was <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> bedding and other articles from the cabin.|$|E

5|$|My dearest mother, This morning, {{about four}} o'clock, I was got up, just one hour after I retired, with the {{information}} that at six {{we were going to}} Richmond. At six we started. The rebs had gone at three, along a road <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> all the munitions of war. Richmond was reached, but the barbarous South had consigned it to flames. The roar of the bursting shells was terrific.|$|E
5|$|The Old Man of Hoy {{is a red}} {{sandstone}} stack and {{perched on}} a plinth of basalt rock. It is separated from the mainland by a 60-metre (200ft) chasm <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> debris, and has nearly vertical sides with a top just a few metres wide. The rock is composed of layers of soft, sandy and pebbly sandstone and harder flagstones of Old Red Sandstone, giving the sides a notched and slab-like profile.|$|E
5|$|The {{kitchen garden}} {{provides}} produce for the property's restaurant {{located in the}} adjacent Strode House; this includes many types of fruit and vegetables. The local St Mary & St Peter's CE VC Primary School, which has bases at Barrington and Ilton, has a vegetable plot where the children plant, tend and cook the produce; the walls are also <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> apple, pear and plum trees. Attached to the garden is a squash court.|$|E

5|$|The folk worship {{representation}} of Shashthi is a red-coloured stone {{about the size}} of a human head, typically placed beneath a banyan tree such as those usually found on the outskirts of villages. The banyan may be decorated with flowers or <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> rice and other offerings. Shashthi is also commonly represented by planting a banyan tree or a small branch in the soil of a family's home garden. Other common representations of the goddess include a Shaligrama stone, an earthen water pitcher, or a Purna Ghata – a water vase with an arrangement of coconut and mango leaves – generally set beneath a banyan tree.|$|E
5|$|While {{traditionally}} the Sirens had been depicted as human–animal chimeras, Etty portrayed them as naked young women, {{on an island}} <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> decaying corpses. The painting divided opinion {{at the time of}} its first exhibition, with some critics greatly admiring it while others derided it as tasteless and unpleasant. Possibly owing to its unusually large size, 442.5cm by 297cm (14ft 6in by 9ft 9in), the work initially failed to sell, and was bought later that year at a bargain price by the Manchester merchant Daniel Grant. Grant died shortly afterwards, and his brother donated The Sirens and Ulysses to the Royal Manchester Institution.|$|E
25|$|Åland {{is today}} an {{autonomous}} province of Finland. The arms of Öland and Åland had been confused, leading Öland {{to adopt the}} arms intended for Åland, featuring two golden deer on a blue field <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> nine white roses. Åland, meanwhile, retained the arms which had originally been granted to Öland in 1560 (a golden deer on a blue field). The arms of Åland are displayed with a comital coronet.|$|E

25|$|Originally, synagogues {{were made}} devoid of much furniture, the Jewish congregants in Spain, the Maghreb (North Africa), Babylonia, the Land of Israel and Yemen having a custom to sit upon the floor, {{which had been}} <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> mats and cushions, rather than upon chairs or benches. In other European towns and cities, however, Jewish congregants would sit upon chairs and benches. Today, the custom has spread in all places to sit upon chairs and benches.|$|E
25|$|In {{works of}} Persian {{literature}} {{such as the}} Shahnameh and Khosrow and Shirin, a famous tragic romance by Nizami Ganjavi (1141–1209), a highly elaborated fictional version of Khosrow's life {{made him one of}} the greatest heroes of the culture, as much as a lover as a king. Khosrow and Shirin tells the story of his love for the Aramean or Roman princess Shirin, who becomes his queen after a lengthy courtship <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> mishaps and difficulties.|$|E

Phoebes fire had {{dismounted}} her guns and left her decks <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> hundreds of casualties.|$|E
25|$|Florrie O'Donoghue, {{intelligence}} {{officer of the}} 1st Cork Brigade IRA at the time, described the scene in Cork {{on the morning of}} the 12th:Many familiar landmarks were gone forever– where whole buildings had collapsed here and there a solitary wall leaned at some crazy angle from its foundation. The streets ran with sooty water, the footpaths were <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> broken glass and debris, ruins smoked and smoldered and over everything was the all-pervasive smell of burning.|$|E
25|$|Bengt Birgersson, {{the first}} Duke of Finland (1254–91, Duke from 1284 until 1291), and Valdemar Magnusson, the second Duke (died 1318, Duke of Finland from 1302 until 1317), both used the later Folkunga coat of arms, {{which was a}} crowned lion rampant with three bends sinister, the main {{difference}} being that Valdemar's arms had the field <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> hearts (Figure 3). This version of the arms was quite similar to the modern coat of arms of Finland, but the lion did not yet brandish any weapon.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile, Lewis and Emma, {{having taken}} the {{opportunity}} to search for plants, had wandered on a little in advance, and had come to another steep slope, which was, however, covered with snow at its upper part. Below, where it became steeper, there was no snow, only pure ice, which extended downwards to an immense distance, broken only here and there by a few rocks that cropped through its surface. It terminated in a rocky gorge, which was <b>strewn</b> thickly <b>with</b> debris from above.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, as the city's crime rates reached an all-time high, {{the station was}} {{considered}} very dangerous, with 11 crimes having taken place there in the year 1990, {{many of which were}} suspected to happen in the tunnel. The tunnel was dimly lit, covered with graffiti, and <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> garbage at the time. In September 2014, improvements started on the tunnel, which area residents had complained about. The tunnel, which had graffiti and was frequented by cyclists riding bikes illegally, was slated to get several murals and some new LED lighting.|$|E
25|$|The landing {{was made}} on a flat surface, with the lander {{reporting}} only 0.3 degrees of tilt. Just before landing, the craft used its thrusters to orient its solar panels along an east-west axis to maximize power generation. The lander waited 15 minutes before opening its solar panels, to allow dust to settle. The first images from the lander became available around 7:00p.m. PDT (2008-05-26 02:00 UTC). The images show a surface <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> pebbles and incised with small troughs into polygons about 5 m across and 10cm high, with the expected absence of large rocks and hills.|$|E
25|$|Six {{weeks after}} the murder of Hicks, Dahmer's father and his fiancée {{returned}} to his home where they discovered Jeffrey living alone at the house. That August, Dahmer enrolled at Ohio State University, hoping to major in business. Dahmer's sole term at Ohio State University was completely unproductive, largely because of his persistent alcohol abuse throughout {{the majority of the}} term. On one occasion, Lionel Dahmer paid a surprise visit to his son, only to find his room <b>strewn</b> <b>with</b> empty liquor bottles. Despite his father having paid in advance for the second term, Dahmer dropped out of university after just three months.|$|E

A well-defined, somewhat irregular interrupted marginal narrow streak is found around more than the posterior fourth of the wing. The stigmata are irregular, about equal, the first discal beyond one-third of the wing, the plical below and somewhat before it, the second discal before two-thirds. The hindwings are fuscous, rather thinly scaled.|$|R
