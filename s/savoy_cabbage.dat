40|$|Glucosinolates are {{important}} secondary compounds, {{commonly found in}} Brassicaceae. To what extent these sulfur and nitrogen containing compounds contribute to the total sulfur pool was investigated. In various cultivars of Brassica oleracea viz. curly kale, pointed cabbage, red cabbage, <b>savoy</b> <b>cabbage</b> and white cabbage, total glucosinolate content and composition of the glucosinolate pool (aliphatic, aromatic and indolyl glucosinolates) were measured, together with determination of the total and inorganic sulfur and nitrogen contents. Differences in {{the contents of the}} individual glucosinolates were found between cultivars and plant parts. In all cultivars the total glucosinolate content was highest in the roots. Roots of curly kale had the highest gluconasturtiin content (12. 6 mumol g(- 1) DW), while the shoot of white cabbage had the lowest glucoiberin content (0. 3 mumol g(- 1) DW). Between all cultivars significant differences in glucosinolate content per class were found. Aromatic glucosinolates were highest in the roots of curly kale, accounting for 63 % of the total content, while the roots of <b>savoy</b> <b>cabbage</b> had the highest aliphatic glucosinolate content (8. 1 mumol g(- 1) DW). Expression of the total glucosinolate fraction on a total sulfur basis showed that the contribution of the glucosinolate fraction was very low (1 - 2 %).
