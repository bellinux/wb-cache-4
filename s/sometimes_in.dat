5|$|Both Continental Scandinavia and Iceland have a {{scattering}} of mentions of elves in medical texts, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> Latin and <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> the form of amulets, where elves are viewed as a possible cause of illness. Most of them have Low German connections.|$|E
5|$|Common toads {{winter in}} various {{holes in the}} ground, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> basements, often in droves with other amphibians. Rarely they spend the winter in flowing waters with the common frogs and green frogs.|$|E
5|$|Favoured {{soils are}} deep grey sandy loams or {{shallower}} sand overlying claypan. Associated vegetation is typically scrubland or shrubland, although moisture-loving trees such as B.littoralis (Swamp Banksia) or Melaleuca preissiana (Moonah) {{may also be}} present, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> sufficient numbers to form a low open woodland.|$|E
50|$|Acraea simulata is <b>sometimes</b> placed <b>in</b> the masamba {{group of}} Acraea, <b>sometimes</b> {{included}} <b>in</b> the Bematistes umbra group.|$|R
50|$|Pilate's wife is <b>sometimes</b> shown <b>in</b> medieval {{depictions of}} scenes {{including}} her husband. She typically stands behind him, <b>sometimes</b> whispering <b>in</b> his ear.|$|R

5|$|In 2013, a 371-page volume {{written by}} John Boston and curated by Damien Broderick, titled Strange Highways: Reading Science Fantasy, 1950–1967 was {{published}} by Borgo/Wildside in the US. It discusses, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> detail, every issue, story, writer, cover, and even advertisement of the magazine.|$|E
5|$|In the 1170s Gothic {{architecture}} {{was introduced}} from France at Canterbury and Westminster Abbey. Over the next 400 years it developed in England, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> parallel with and influenced by Continental forms, but generally with great local diversity and originality.|$|E
5|$|On several occasions, {{people have}} {{illegally}} tried to stow away {{on board the}} train, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> large groups, trying to enter the UK; border monitoring and security is therefore extremely tight.|$|E
50|$|Autoimmune {{thrombocytopenia}} and anemia <b>sometimes</b> seen <b>in</b> {{patients with}} SMZL. Circulating villous lymphocytes are <b>sometimes</b> observed <b>in</b> peripheral blood samples. A monoclonal paraprotein is detected {{in a third}} of patients without hypergammaglobulinemia or hyperviscosity.|$|R
50|$|Today, tinginys is {{sometimes}} produced using less expensive ingredients and with even easier methods. Cocoa is <b>sometimes</b> used <b>in</b> place of chocolate, and condensed milk is <b>sometimes</b> used <b>in</b> place of boiled, solidified milk.|$|R
50|$|Nowadays, the sapoyoa is <b>sometimes</b> placed <b>in</b> {{the family}} Eurylaimidae with the broadbills. Others {{tentatively}} place the sapayoa in the asity family Philepittidae otherwise found only <b>in</b> Madagascar and <b>sometimes</b> included <b>in</b> the broadbill family.|$|R
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} is {{the production}} of colour by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> combination with pigments. For example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their microscopic structure makes them also reflect blue, turquoise, and green light, and they are often iridescent.|$|E
5|$|Successfully {{mimicking}} {{a genuine}} scientific work, Rhinogradentia {{has appeared in}} several publications without any note of its fictitious nature, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> connection with April Fools' Day.|$|E
5|$|The cosmic {{abundance}} of vanadium {{in the universe}} is 0.0001%, making the element nearly as common as copper or zinc. Vanadium is detected spectroscopically in light from the Sun and <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> the light from other stars.|$|E
50|$|The {{subfamily}} is <b>sometimes</b> placed <b>in</b> {{the family}} Cystiscidae, and is <b>sometimes</b> instead left <b>in</b> the family Marginellidae the margin snails. It {{is within the}} clade Neogastropoda.|$|R
50|$|A {{cosmetic}} container, cosmetic box, or cosmetic vessel {{is found}} in the historical records, both as an artifact, as relief items in some cultures, and are <b>sometimes</b> referenced <b>in</b> historical or archaeological literature. They are <b>sometimes</b> created <b>in</b> specific styles, shapes, or motifs.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 8-10 mm. The forewings {{are white}} with two bright ferruginous fasciae, mixed with black dorsally and <b>sometimes</b> black-edged <b>in</b> the disc. The first is median, inwardly oblique {{and the second}} opposite the tornus, vertical, confluent on the costa and <b>sometimes</b> connected <b>in</b> the disc. There are ferruginous streaks from the second fascia along the costa and termen to the apex, sometimes undefined or indistinct, <b>sometimes</b> terminating <b>in</b> an apical spot of black scales. The hindwings are dark fuscous.|$|R
5|$|There {{are more}} than 100 bird species in the park, {{including}} Eurasian eagle-owl, rock ptarmigan, alpine accentor, and chough. Golden eagles nest on rocky ledges, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> trees. Wallcreeper are found on steep cliffs. There are black woodpeckers and nutcrackers in the park's woodlands.|$|E
5|$|While stone {{buildings}} {{became more}} and more common as town houses, farms continued to be half-timbered, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with a single stone house. Ordinary people continued to live in half-timbered houses.|$|E
5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E

5|$|According to Ehrman, Jesus {{taught that}} a coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not {{anything}} in this life. He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> opposition to other traditions. Jesus put love {{at the center of}} the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).|$|E
5|$|After exchanging ideas, Parker {{will write}} a script, {{and from there}} the entire team of animators, editors, technicians, and sound {{engineers}} will each typically work 100–120 hours in the ensuing week. Since the show's fourth season (2000), Parker has assumed most of the show's directorial duties, while Stone relinquished {{his share of the}} directing to focus on handling the coordination and business aspects of the production. On Wednesday, a completed episode is sent to Comedy Central's headquarters via satellite uplink, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> just a few hours before its air time of 10 PM Eastern Time.|$|E
5|$|Although it is toxic {{in large}} doses, {{selenium}} {{is an essential}} micronutrient for animals. In plants, it occurs as a bystander mineral, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> toxic proportions in forage (some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals, but other plants, such as locoweed, require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil). See more on plant nutrition below.|$|E

5|$|As {{a symbol}} of {{national}} pride, an example from the BA fleet made occasional flypasts at selected Royal events, major air shows and other special occasions, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> formation with the Red Arrows. On {{the final day of}} commercial service, public interest was so great that grandstands were erected at Heathrow Airport. Significant numbers of people attended the final landings; the event received widespread media coverage.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that megalodon preyed upon many cetacean species, such as dolphins, small whales, cetotheres, squalodontids, sperm whales, bowhead whales, and rorquals. In addition to this, they also targeted seals, sirenians, and large sea turtles. However, the shark was also an opportunist and piscivorous, {{and it would have}} also gone after smaller fish and other sharks. Many whale bones have been found with deep gashes most likely made by their teeth. Various excavations have revealed megalodon teeth lying close to the chewed remains of whales, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> direct association with them.|$|E
5|$|Greek mythology {{is known}} today {{primarily}} from Greek literature and representations on visual media {{dating from the}} Geometric period from c. 900–800 BC onward. In fact, literary and archaeological sources integrate, sometimes mutually supportive and <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> conflict; however, in many cases, {{the existence of this}} corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots.|$|E
