40|$|Abstract. Conservation {{agriculture}} {{is a concept}} for resource-saving agricultural crop production that strives to achieve acceptable profits together with high and sustained production levels while concurrently conserving the environment. Conservation {{agriculture is}} based on enhancing natural biological processes {{above and below the}} ground. Interventions such as mechanical soil tillage are reduced to an absolute minimum, and the use of external inputs such as agrochemicals and nutrients of mineral or organic origin are applied at an optimum level and in a way and quantity that does not interfere with, or disrupt, the biological processes. CA is characterized by two principles, which are linked to each other. It is continuous minimum mechanical soil disturbance and permanent organic soil cover. Conservation tillage (agriculture) technologies where ploughing by a moldboard plough is replaced by tillers and shallow soil loosening in increasingly used as a soil treatment. It is typical for shallow soil tillage that all plant residues are left on the soil surface, or in the tilled upper soil layer. The plant residues can play very important role by next plant cultivation. The shovel and discs tillers are possible to use to advantage in conventional soil tillage systems and also by using conservation soil tillage technologies where is ploughing replaced by shallow tillage. In the experimental section the aim of research was described which is possible to summarize briefly as follows – the evaluation of soil physical properties on tillers work quality (especially on size of clods after soil treatment on the top and in the soil profile), evaluation of sweep tillers and disc tillers work quality by <b>stubble</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Key words: conservation soil tillage, consevation agriculture, sweep tiller...|$|E
40|$|This study aims at characterizing {{agricultural}} soils’ structure {{depending on}} the tillage system: conventional tillage or conservational tillage. Tillage reduction is an increasing practice, but the micro-structural effects on soils and on their hydrodynamic parameters are still not well described. Recent research shows non-converging results. Our point is to highlight fundamental differences in structure through characterization of soils porosity’s parameters using X-ray microtomography measurements coupled to image analysis. This attempt {{is in line with}} a more integrated experiment of which the aim is to quantify the effects of tillage intensity on lateral flow production, and finally on global water balance. Parameters’ measurements consist in a combined approach, based on two different space-time scales of exploration: fundamental scale, with soil sampling campaign for microtomography analysis, and field scale, with continuous flow measurements (plots’ dimensions: 18 * 28 m). For their part, parameters for water balance determination (precipitation, evapotranspiration…) are monitored on the field. All of these measurements have the main objective of hydrological modeling enhancement by taking into account a better lateral flow description. Discussion in this paper will focus on the first results obtained by X-ray microtomography measurements. Our experiment takes place in Gentinnes (Walloon Brabant, Belgium), on a field organized in a split-plot scheme. Since 2004, plots have been cultivated in conventional tillage or in reduced tillage. The latter consists in sowing after <b>stubble</b> <b>ploughing</b> of about 10 cm. The crop rotation is sugar beet followed by winter wheat. The soil is mainly composed of silt loam. Soils samples, with a 3 cm diameter and a 5 cm height, were removed from the upper layer (Ap horizon) for both management practices. Samples are scanned by X-ray microtomography using a Skyscan- 1172 high-resolution desk-top micro-CT system (Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium). The cone beam source operated at 100 kV, using an aluminium filter. The detector configuration, i. e. 1048 × 2000 pixels 16 -bit X-ray camera, and the distance source-object-camera were adjusted to produce images with a pixel size of 17 µm. This resolution allows us to visualize both meso- and macro- porosity. In this study, half the samples were placed under a 15000 kPa pressure (corresponding pressure for the wilting point) in Richards’ apparatus in order to empty the meso- and macro-porosity. To determine a priori the class of porosity for the samples, relations between water retention and pressure head can be plotted using this apparatus. Scanning results consist in 2 D images. The 2 D images are recombined to form 3 D structure. Then the pore network can be analyzed through useful factors like size distribution, shape, connectivity, orientation, tortuosity etc. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Presentado al 96 th Ecological Society of America Annual Meeting celebrado en Austin, Texas del 7 al 12 de agosto de 2011. [Background/Question/Methods]: Farmland {{ecosystems}} are severely threatened due to agricultural intensification which {{contributes to a}} significant loss of biodiversity. Farmland and steppe birds are particularly vulnerable species linked to these ecosystems and are the most threatened bird group, with 83 % of the species subject to unfavourable status. Agri-environmental schemes (AES) are today considered the most important instruments to counteract {{the negative effects of}} intensive agriculture. However, their effectiveness seems to be highly variable between studies, localities and organism groups, making it difficult to assess their benefits. Most of these studies have been carried out at mid- or high latitudes of the northern hemisphere, and very few in the Mediterranean region. Are AES effective against agricultural intensification in central Spain? Do AES improve habitat quality? How do AES influence steppe birds? Since 2001, an AES program is being carried out in a Special Protection Area for birds (SPA 139) in central Spain. The great bustard was used as indicator species to study bird responses to AES. The great bustard Otis tarda L. is a large steppe bird which has suffered marked declines during the last decades and today is considered Globally Threatened. Males and females aggregate at leks for mating. Bustards were counted during winter and spring (2001 - 2010) in five experimental leks (with AES) and three control leks (without AES). We computed an index of agricultural intensification as percentage of surface engaged to cereal crop and ploughed land. Availability of plants and arthropods was estimated in 328 cereal fields, legumes, <b>stubbles,</b> <b>ploughed</b> fields, fallows, and borders between cultivated fields in areas with and without AES. [Results/Conclusions]: The abundance of bustards increased at experimental leks in winter and spring, whereas control leks did not show significant changes. Fallows, borders and legume fields had significantly more diversity, abundance and biomass of arthropod and plants. The agricultural intensification index was significantly reduced in areas with AES. These areas also showed higher food availability than areas without AES. Agri-environment schemes counteracted the negative impact of agricultural intensification. In this context, it improved habitat quality by providing increased food availability. AES may thus contribute to preserve threatened steppe-birds living in Mediterranean dryland farmland areas.

The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the effect of stubble crops used on the size and structure of barley yield. The three-year study showed an increasing trend in grain yield of spring barley grown after the mixture of legumes, lacy phacelia, and white mustard compared to its size in the treatment with no cover crop. Straw yield was significantly higher when barley was grown after the mixture of narrowleaf lupin with field pea than in the other treatments of the experiment.

Earthworm activity was similar under the 2 no-till systems, although a trend towards bigger earthworms with increasing penetration resistance was observed under the system with burning.

It was now that I first obtained an adequate idea {{of one of the most}} wonderful systems of cultivation in the world, equalling all that is related of Chinese industry, and as far as I know surpassing in the labour that has been bestowed upon it any tract of equal extent in the most civilized countries of Europe. I rode through this strange garden utterly amazed and hardly able to realize the fact that in this remote and little known island, from which all Europeans except a few traders at the port are jealously excluded, many hundreds of square miles of irregularly undulating country have been so skillfully terraced and levelled, and so permeated by artificial channels, that every portion of it can be irrigated and dried at pleasure. According as the slope of the ground is more or less rapid, each terraced plot consists in some places of many acres, in others of a few square yards. We saw them in every state of cultivation; some in <b>stubble,</b> some being <b>ploughed,</b> some with rice-crops in various stages of growth. Here were luxuriant patches of tobacco; there, cucumbers, sweet potatoes, yams, beans or Indian-corn varied the scene. In some places the ditches were dry, in others little streams crossed our road and were distributed over lands about to be sown or planted. The banks which bordered every terrace rose regularly in horizontal lines above each other; sometimes rounding an abrupt knoll and looking like a fortification, or sweeping around some deep hollow and forming on a gigantic scale the seats of an amphitheatre. Every brook and rivulet had been diverted from its bed, and instead of flowing along the lowest ground, were to be found crossing our road half-way up an ascent, yet bordered by ancient trees and moss-grown stones so as to have all the appearance of a natural channel, and bearing testimony to the remote period at which the work had been done. As we advanced further into the country, the scene was diversified by abrupt rocky hills, by steep ravines, and by clumps of bamboos and palm-trees near houses or villages; while in the distance the fine range of mountains of which Lombock Peak, eight thousand feet high, is the culminating point, formed a fit background to a view scarcely to be surpassed either in human interest or picturesque beauty.|$|R
40|$|Soil {{degradation}} in {{crop production}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important because of the growing concern it poses on soil functions. Prominent among the degradation factors is soil compaction. It impairs soil productivity by impeding the soil conductivity potential and moisture retention ability, thereby preventing root penetrability and nutrients uptake among other things. This paper is concerned with identifying and characterizing the degree of compaction that may result in deleterious effects on soil physical properties, and the interaction that exists between crop growth and productivity. The above shall be achieved through field and laboratory determination of soil measurements from samples collected on a silty clay loam, and a silty loam soil at the University of Life Sciences (UMB / NMBU) experiment field Three land preparation practices (Autumn ploughing at 20 – 22 cm depth; Spring ploughing at 12 – 15 cm depth and Spring harrowing at 4 - 6 cm depth i. e. without <b>ploughing),</b> <b>stubble</b> cultivation and compaction were the treatments used in a three factorial field trials on a silty clay loam and a silty loam soil to conduct the investigation at the UMB / NMBU experiment field. The three main grain crops produced for the last 20 years were: wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), oats (Avena sativa L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Field data collection and standard laboratory procedures were performed using different equipments and gadgets to process the data. These were calculated and statistically analyzed by the ANOVA methods (GLM procedure), (SAS Institute, 1990). The various treatments did not show much diversity in densification save few tillage applications with stubble cultivation, compaction, and a combined tillage and compaction treatments that were significant S* (i. e. Pr > F) than the others as shown in Tables 2, 4, 8 and 9 in results. Tillage in depths 5 - 10 cm and 15 – 20 cm showed significant penetration resistant (PR) (Pr > F), and stubble cultivation in depths 10 – 15 cm and 25 – 30 cm also gave significant PR (Pr > F). Fraction 6 – 20 mm exhibited significant aggregate size distribution with tillage application (Pr > F) in Tab. 4. Volume % was significant (Pr > F) with compaction application for pF 4. 2 in depth 25 - 30 cm, while weight % was equally significant for pF 4. 2 in the same depth with the same treatment. The same trend occurred for both pF 4. 2 weight % and volume % for combined tillage times compaction application in the same depths. There was minimal difference in dry matter (DM) % between treatments, as well as water content in grain yield at harvest. However, both grain yield and dry matter % showed significant level (Pr > F) with tillage treatment, but only grain yield gave significant level with compaction treatment. The maximum bulk density (BD) observed in this trial was 1. 60 g / cm³, which is just slightly above the minimum critical limit of 1. 55 g / cm³ that may restrict root penetration. In this case, any hindrance to root piercing may eminate from the presence of clay minerals, ions bonding and particle density. This implies that a minimum level of compaction resulted from the treatments. M-P...|$|R
40|$|A farmer has to plan what {{to produce}} and how to produce it. To assist his {{decision-making}} a number of techniques are employed. A work study shows in detail how the production is or can be done. On the other hand linear programming is a tool for selecting crops. Work management (machinery selection and scheduling of operations) {{is somewhere in between}} these two approaches. The machinery selection problem and the selection of crops depend on each other and so both require constraints for man and workable time of machine operations. These constraints are insufficient to represent correctly the scheduling of operations. The scheduling of farm operations depends on the available men and machinery, on the available materials (products, cattle) and on the weather and properties of materials (moisture content). Scheduling has been studied for one material (corn) or one operation (harvesting), but seldom for several materials and operations competing for the use of men and machinery. This scheduling problem is a dynamic programming problem where each stage of the system coincides with a decision date. Three subsystems can be distinguished. The biological subsystem consists of materials waiting for operations which are performed by gangs from the man/machine subsystem. The climate subsystem influences the properties of the materials and the application of gangs. In Fig. 1 terms and relations for the grain harvest are given. The aim of the present study is to develop a simulation method to solve the scheduling problem that correctly represents the use of men and machinery and the resulting flow of materials and uses hourly data on weather and properties of materials. To decide at each decision date which operations are to be executed, a heuristic strategy is developed to evaluate {{the current state of the}} system. This detailed model of the scheduling problem is simplified by omitting, for example, the setup and service of machines and by aggregating the weather information within days or weeks. So a range of problems is formulated that are solved by the simulation model. The most simple problem can easily be tailored for a linear programming model. With a range of problems we can evaluate to what extent scheduling problems might be relaxed (using less constraints). The heuristic strategy uses the concept of urgency of processing a material. This idea is based on the existence of a timeliness function of each material with a maximum return at a given date (moment of time for example 1 August 20 h 00). After that optimum date the return diminishes with time. These timeliness losses are partly unavoidable because the capacity of men and machinery to process materials is limited. With the given men and machinery the decision maker only can decide to process a material or not, where not processing means an avoidable timeliness loss (the urgency). The urgency of a material is calculated for each material separately on the basis of the available quantity. For the grain harvest a state of the system is given in Fig. 2. The quantity of materials (wheat, straw etc.) is represented by a queue of so-called 'fields'. Fields differ in some property of a material, for instance ripening date or moisture content and may also refer to geographical position. The operation period for the available quantity of a material is derived from the expected workable time, the estimated fraction of the time men and machinery are available for processing the material and the capacity of processing the material. Not starting the processing of some acreage of a material at the current decision date is equivalent to a delay until the end of the operation period. So the value of the timeliness function at the decision date minus the value at the end of the period is the avoidable loss, and an element of the urgency of a material. The fraction of the time men and machine are available for processing the material is derived from a linear programming model with weekly periods and is input for the simulation models. The capacity of processing the material is derived from the combinations (sets of gangs) and the capacity of the gangs (men and machinery performing an operation on a material according to a method). The farmer can only decide to use one combination or another or none at all. Therefore it is necessary to assign the urgency of materials to the gangs and to the combinations by distributing the urgency of materials among the gangs processing that material relative to their capacities. Such an urgency of a gang (in $ per hour) is corrected by subtracting the variable costs of, for example, overtime. The urgency of a combination is the sum of the urgency of those gangs which have a positive corrected urgency and can operate in the combination. Whether a gang is applied depends on equipment, weather, material properties (moisture content), available material for processing and available storage for the materials delivered. After selecting the preferred combination (with maximum urgency), the next decision date is found as the minimum from a number of potential decision dates determined by end of operation, filling the storage, start of overtime or pause or no- work time, change of weather expectation or properties of materials, machine failure or by finish of repair or service. Executing operations performed by the gangs in the preferred combination results in processing and delivering materials. Thus transformation of the quantity of materials is necessary to learn the state of the system on the next decision date. This state again is evaluated by the strategy resulting in urgencies of processing materials and a preferred combination; this cycle is repeated until the job is completed. The transformation also results in recording the timeliness loss of materials, the use of men, machinery and variable costs for overtime or drying. The delivery of materials introduces new fields. The grain harvest in the Netherlands is used to learn about the behaviour of the simulation model. The wheat is harvested with a combine harvester and the wet grain (19 - 23 % moisture content) is dried; the straw is baled, loaded and stored in the barn and the <b>stubble</b> is <b>ploughed.</b> Eight years with hourly weather and material data from 1 August- 15 September are used. Some general results from the experiments are that the simulation model is suitable for deriving relations between acreage, yield and machinery (Section 3. 5. 5) and that relaxed problems (simplified problems; Section 3. 5. 6) result in lower estimated costs or are more optimistic about the scheduling of operations than the strategy in the detailed scheduling problem. So if the detailed problem is acceptable for scheduling operations with a satisfactory use of equipment and variable costs and a correct representation of the flow of materials, then the simplified problems and the linear programming model result in too low estimated costs. The validation of the heuristic strategy is impossible because there are no data available. The results of the experiments, however, contribute to our knowledge of the scheduling problem and so the model is useful. Comparing different experiments shows the danger of using relaxed problems. Experiments with the simulation model for the scheduling problem show the sensitivity of different machinery systems, which is of use in training farmers to improve their management ability.

However, {{this must be}} achieved without compromising the results of tillage. In a project {{carried out in the}} autumn of 2003, draught requirement and tillage outcomes were compared for different tillage implements during autumn sowing on a light soil and a heavy soil. The tillage implements used were mouldboard <b>plough,</b> shallow <b>plough,</b> <b>stubble</b> cultivator, heavy duty stubble cultivator with wing shares, tandem disc harrow and heavy disc harrow designed for shallow tillage. Except for the mouldboard plough, one and two passes were investigated for each implement. After primary tillage, the seedbed was prepared with a disc harrow for shallow tillage and a roller adapted for cultivation. Seed was drilled using a combi-drill with discs for shallow tillage. For each implement the fuel consumption was measured using an adapted tractor (Massey Ferguson 6290) with equipment for measuring fuel consumption. The equipment was calibrated to give the PTO effect for any combination of fuel consumption and engine speed. This effect was assumed to be equal to the effect available at the wheels. The drawbar power was calculated by subtracting power losses through wheel slip and rolling resistance. The draught requirement was calculated by dividing the drawbar power by the actual speed, which was measured during work. The actual working depth was calculated by measuring bulk density before tillage and then weighing the cultivated soil from a specific area. On the basis of the tillage depth, the working width and the draught requirements, it was possible to calculate the specific draught (force per cross-sectional tilled area, kN/m 2). The draught per metre working width (kN/m) was also calculated and used to calculate the fuel consumption per hectare for the different systems. Some of the cultivated soil from each line was sieved into different fractions, allowing the approximate surface area of the tilled soil (m 2 /kg) and the energy requirement for fracturing (J/m 2) to be calculated. After drilling, the soil surface was photographed and the images were analysed to calculate how much of the soil surface was covered with straw from the previous crop. To make a fair comparison of draught between different tillage implements, the actual working depth must be taken into consideration. The pre-set working depth is not an adequate parameter because the different implements do not leave equally uniform tillage bases. Therefore they till different volumes of soil at a particular pre-set working depth. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough nearly always worked to the pre-set depth while the other implements always tilled to a shallower level than the pre-set depth. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough had the lowest specific draught requirement. On the light soil, the specific draught did not differ much between the other implements. On the heavy soil, however, the specific draught was highest for the stubble cultivator and the heavy duty stubble cultivator with wing shares. The specific draught for the second pass was higher than that for the first pass for each implement because the actual working depth became very shallow. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough were least effective at fracturing the soil, while there was little difference between the other implements. However, the tandem disc harrow and the heavy disc harrow designed for shallow tillage fractured the soil most effectively. The fracturing did not increase much after the second pass with any of the implements. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough buried the straw best, while the direct drilling treatment left most straw on the soil surface. The differences between the other implements were low. The second pass did not seem to decrease the amount of straw on the soil surface. The tillage systems with the mouldboard plough and the shallow plough consumed the most fuel. Much of the fuel used in the overall tillage process is consumed in seedbed preparation. Both the tillage systems with the plough required more seedbed preparation than the other systems {{and that was one of}} the reasons why the fuel consumption was higher. The direct drilling system required the lowest amount of fuel. Of all the cultivation systems, those with one pass with the tandem disc harrow and the heavy disc harrow for shallow tillage consumed the least fuel. On the basis of all the parameters studied here, it is hard to identify an optimal tillage system. The choice depends on the prevailing conditions in the field in question. If there is a large amount of straw from the previous crop that is likely to cause problems, the mouldboard plough or the shallow plough are preferable because in such cases it is important to bury the straw well and this can justify the higher fuel consumption. The results of this study show that shallow ploughing (~ 11 cm) with either of the two ploughs requires a lower amount of fuel, fractures the soil better and buries the straw as well as deep ploughing (~ 20 cm). If the straw from the previous crop is not a problem, the system with the heavy disc harrow for shallow tillage or the heavy duty stubble cultivator with wing shares is preferable since both these implements give high soil fracturing and slicing across the entire working width, killing weeds effectively...|$|R
