25|$|For crewed rockets various {{methods are}} used to reduce the <b>sound</b> <b>intensity</b> for the passengers, and {{typically}} {{the placement of the}} astronauts far away from the rocket engines helps significantly. For the passengers and crew, when a vehicle goes supersonic the sound cuts off as the sound waves are no longer able {{to keep up with the}} vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The human ear {{has a large}} {{dynamic range}} in sound reception. The ratio of the <b>sound</b> <b>intensity</b> that causes {{permanent}} damage during short exposure {{to that of the}} quietest sound that the ear can hear is {{greater than or equal to}} 1 trillion (1012). Such large measurement ranges are conveniently expressed in logarithmic scale: the base-10 logarithm of 1012 is 12, which is expressed as a sound pressure level of 120dB re 20μPa.|$|E
25|$|The value zero plays {{a special}} role for many {{physical}} quantities. For some quantities, the zero level is naturally distinguished {{from all other}} levels, whereas for others it {{is more or less}} arbitrarily chosen. For example, for an absolute temperature (as measured in kelvins) zero is the lowest possible value (negative temperatures are defined, but negative-temperature systems are not actually colder). This is in contrast to for example temperatures on the Celsius scale, where zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the freezing point of water. Measuring <b>sound</b> <b>intensity</b> in decibels or phons, the zero level is arbitrarily set at a reference value—for example, at a value for the threshold of hearing. In physics, the zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may possess and is the energy of the ground state of the system.|$|E

In humans, the vocalization-induced stapedius reflex reduces <b>sound</b> <b>intensities</b> reaching the inner ear by approximately 20 decibels. The reflex is triggered {{in anticipation of the}} onset of vocalization. While the vocalization-induced stapedius reflex in humans results in an approximate 20 dB reduction in transduction to the inner ear, birds have a stronger stapedius reflex that is invoked just before the bird tweets.|$|R

40|$|In 1956 George Miller {{called our}} {{attention}} to the still unexplained fact that humans can identify only about seven (plus or minus two) tones, or <b>sound</b> <b>intensities,</b> without error. Beyond the “magical number seven ” increasing the number of such stimuli to be identified produces little gain in information transmitted. Stimuli that are identified perfectly as part of a set of four or five are confused when {{they are part of a}} larger set. Since confusions do not occur if the number of stimuli is small, they cannot be completely due to sensory limitations. Further evidence that the limitations on accuracy are not solely due to lack of sensitivity is provided by the range effect. As the separation between adjacent stimuli in a set is increased there is, at first, a gain in accuracy. This, however, quickly levels off. In fact, Pollack (1952) found that the range of tones to be identified can be increased by a factor of about 20 without much improvement in accuracy. Extensive work on the range effect, and other problems of intensity resolution, has lead Durlach and Braida (1969) and their collaborators to conclude that the main source of error in absolute identification of <b>sound</b> <b>intensities</b> is memory (see Berliner, Durlach and Braida, 1978; Braida and Durlach, 1972; Purks, Callahan, Braida, and Durlach, 1980).

40|$|Signal {{processing}} in {{the auditory}} brainstem {{is based on}} an interaction of neuronal excitation and inhibition. To date, we have incomplete knowledge of how the dynamic interplay of both contributes to the processing power and temporal characteristics of signal coding. The spherical bushy cells (SBCs) of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) receive their primary excitatory input through auditory nerve fibers via large, axosomatic synaptic terminals called the endbulbs of Held and by additional, acoustically driven inhibitory inputs. SBCs provide the input to downstream nuclei of the brainstem sound source localization circuitry, such as the medial and lateral superior olive, which rely on temporal precise inputs. In this study, we used juxtacellular recordings in anesthetized Mongolian gerbils to assess the effect of acoustically evoked inhibition on the SBCs input-output function and on temporal precision of SBC spiking. Acoustically evoked inhibition proved to be strong enough to suppress action potentials (APs) of SBCs in a stimulus-dependent manner. Inhibition shows slow onset and offset dynamics and increasing strength at higher <b>sound</b> <b>intensities.</b> In addition, inhibition decreases the rising slope of the EPSP and prolongs the EPSP-to-AP transition time. Both effects can be mimicked by iontophoretic application of glycine. Inhibition also improves phase locking of SBC APs to low-frequency tones by acting as a gain control to suppress poorly timed EPSPs from generating postsynaptic APs to maintain precise SBC spiking across <b>sound</b> <b>intensities.</b> The present data suggest that inhibition substantially contributes to the processing power of second-order neurons in the ascending auditory system...|$|R

40|$|It {{is argued}} from a {{physical}} {{point of view}} that the criteria for acousto-optic Bragg diffraction (characterized by only two orders of light being present) must ultimately include the strength of the sound field. This follows because the scattering effect that is due to the sidelobes of a rectangular transducer, although negligible at low power levels where the Bragg criterion is indeed sound-level independent, becomes of increasing importance at high power levels and causes additional orders to be generated. In this paper we demonstrate this numerically by reduction of the sidelobes through Hamming apodization of the sound field. The results clearly demonstrate a significant reduction in the light powers of the spurious orders, thereby extending Bragg operation to higher <b>sound</b> <b>intensities</b> than normally feasible...|$|R
