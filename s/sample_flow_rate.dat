The experiments were carried out with test clouds of UICC amosite and UICC chrysotile with aerodynamic characteristics sufficiently close to those of workplace dusts to allow direct comparison to be made, {{at least as far as}} the immediate aims of this enquiry are concerned. It was shown unambiguously, for conditions of practical interest, that there were no significant effects of <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and wind speed on the measurement of fibre mass concentration and fibre number concentration respectively. Thus, any observed bias in the measurement of fibre concentration by manual counting must instead be attributable to psychological effects relating to the density of fibres on the filter. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that recommended procedures which impose limitations on <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> or face velocity are unnecessarily restrictive.

40|$|Manipulating and discriminating {{biological}} {{cells of}} interest using microfluidic and micro {{total analysis system}} (μTAS) devices have potential applications in clinical diagnosis and medicine. Cellular focusing in microfluidic devices {{is a prerequisite for}} medical applications, such as cell sorting, cell counting, or flow cytometry. In the present study, an insulator-based dielectrophoretic microdevice is designed for the simultaneous filtration and focusing of biological cells. The cells are introduced into the microchannel and hydrodynamically pre-confined by funnel-shaped insulating structures close to the inlet. There are ten sets of X-patterned insulating structures in the microfluidic channel. The main function of the first five sets of insulating structures is to guide the cells by negative dielectrophoretic responses (viable HeLa cells) into the center region of the microchannel. The positive dielectrophoretic cells (dead HeLa cells) are attracted to regions with a high electric-field gradient generated {{at the edges of the}} insulating structures. The remaining five sets of insulating structures are mainly used to focus negative dielectrophoretic cells that have escaped from the upstream region. Experiments employing a mixture of dead and viable HeLa cells are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. The results indicate that the performance of both filtration and focusing improves with the increasing strength of the applied electric field and a decreasing inlet <b>sample</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> which agrees with the trend predicted by the numerical simulations.

40|$|In {{black carbon}} (BC) {{measurements}} obtained using the filter-based optical technique, artifacts {{are a major}} problem. Recently, it has become possible to correct these artifacts {{to a certain extent}} by using numerical methods. Nevertheless, all correction schemes have their advantages and disadvantages under field conditions. In this study, a new correction model {{that can be used for}} determining artifact effects on BC measurements was proposed; the model is based on two different light attenuation (ATN) increasing rates. Two aethalometers were used to measure ATN values in parallel at aerosol <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of 6 and 2 L min − 1. In the absence of sampling artifacts, the ratio of ATN values measured by the two aethalometers should be equal to the ratio of the <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> (or aerosol deposition rates) of these two aethalometers. In practice, the ratio of ATN values measured by the two aethalometers was not the same as the ratio of the <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of the aethalometers because the aerosol loading effects varied with the aerosol deposition rate. If the true ATN value can be found, then BC measurements can be corrected for artifacts by using the true ATN change rate. Therefore, determining the true ATN value was the primary objective of this study. The proposed correction algorithm can be used to obtain the true ATN value from ATN values acquired at different <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> and the actual BC mass concentrations can be determined from the true ATN change rate. Before BC correction, the BC concentration measured at the <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of 6 L min − 1 was smaller than that measured at 2 L min − 1 by approximately 13 and 9 % in summer and winter seasons, respectively. After BC correction by using the true ATN value, the corrected BC for 6 L min − 1 can be exactly equal to the corrected BC for 2 L min − 1. Field test results demonstrated that loading effects on BC measurements could be corrected accurately by using the proposed model. Additionally, the problem of enhanced light ATN caused by light scattering at the unloaded filter can be overcome without using any light scattering coefficient. Therefore, the correction algorithm can be applied to a newly designed instrument to determine actual real-time BC concentrations by using two sampling spots for different aerosol deposition rates. Moreover, a simple empirical correction scheme for post-processing for correcting the existed aethalometer BC data is also presented. While this simple correction scheme is dependent on the aerosol type, it can be used to correct BC data when the primary source of BC and the weather conditions are similar to those in this study. Furthermore, two existed aethalometers with appropriate flow control can be used to create correction schemes suitable for different environments...|$|R

They differ from each other by the medium onto which the bioaerosol particles are collected (glass, agar, and liquid) but have the same inlet and collection geometries and the same <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> The bioaerosol concentrations recorded by three different collection techniques have been compared with each other: impaction onto a glass slide, impaction onto an agar medium, and impingement into a liquid. It {{was found that the}} particle collection efficiency of agar slide impaction depends on the concentration of agar in the collection medium and on the sampling time, when samples are collected on a nonmoving agar slide. Impingement into a liquid showed anomalous behavior with respect to the <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> Optimal <b>sampling</b> conditions in which all three new samplers exhibit the same overall sampling efficiency for nonbiological particles have been established.

40|$|The recent {{rapid growth}} of {{microfluidic}} applications has witnessed the emergence of several particle flow focusing techniques for analysis and/or further processing. The majority of flow focusing techniques employ an external sheath fluid to achieve <b>sample</b> <b>flow</b> focusing independent of the <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> in contrast to sheath-free techniques. However, {{the introduction of a}} sheath fluid to surround the sample fluid has complicated the device design and fabrication, generally involving multi-layer fabrication and bonding of multiple polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layers. Several promising efforts have been made to reduce the complexity of fabrication. However, most of these methods involved the use of inertial/Dean effects, which in turn demanded the use of higher <b>sample</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> In this paper, we report a method of flow focusing that uses a sheath fluid to enclose the sample in a single layer of PDMS, and that possesses applicability {{for a wide range of}} <b>sample</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> This method of flow focusing uses abrupt channel depth variation and a shift of one of the sample-sheath junctions (termed as `junction-shift') against the direction of the <b>sample</b> <b>flow.</b> This configuration serves to manipulate the sample fluid with respect to the sheath fluid and achieve the desired flow focusing. This design facilitates the attainment of 3 D flow focusing in two sequential steps (depth-wise and then along the lateral direction) and in distinct regions, hence enabling the regions to be used in imaging and non-imaging flow cytometric applications, respectively. Simulations were performed to characterize and determine the optimum set of design parameters.

This paper reports a method for the determination of zinc in Brazilian sugar cane spirit, (cachaça in Portuguese), using solid-phase extraction with a flow injection analysis system and detection by FAAS. The sorbent material used was activated carbon obtained from Moringa oleifera husks. Flow and chemical variables of the proposed system were optimized through multivariate designs. The factors selected were sorbent mass, sample pH, <b>sample</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> and eluent concentration. The optimum extraction conditions were obtained using a sample pH of 4. 0, a <b>sample</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of 6. 0 mL min − 1, 30. 0 mg of sorbent mass, and 1. 0 mol L − 1 HNO 3 as the eluent at a flow rate of 4. 0 mL min − 1. The limit of detection for zinc was 1. 9 μgL − 1, and the precision was below 0. 82 % (20. 0 μgL − 1, n = 7). The analytical curve was linear from 2 to 50 μgL − 1,withacorrelationcoefficient of 0. 9996. The method developed was successfully applied to spiked Brazilian sugar cane spirit, and accuracy was assessed through recovery tests, with results ranging from 83 % to 100 %. 1...|$|E
40|$|Trabalho completo: acesso restrito, p. 1264 – 1269 In {{the present}} paper, a {{procedure}} for preconcentration and determination of copper in soft drink using flame {{atomic absorption spectrometry}} (FAAS) is proposed, {{which is based on}} solid-phase extraction of copper(II) ions as its ion pair of 1, 10 -phenanthroline complexes with the anionic surfactant sodium dodecil sulphate (SDS), by Amberlite XAD- 2 resin. The optimization process was carried out using 24 – 1 factorial and 22 factorial with a center point designs. Four variables (XAD- 2 mass, copper mass, <b>sample</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and elution flow rate) were regarded as factors in the optimization. Student's t-test on the results of the 24 – 1 factorial design with eight runs for copper extraction, demonstrated that the factors XAD- 2 mass and <b>sample</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> in the levels studied are statistically significant. The 22 factorial with a center point design was applied {{in order to determine the}} optimum conditions for extraction. The procedure proposed allowed the determination of copper with detection limits (3 α/S) of 3. 9 μg l− 1. The precision, calculated as relative standard deviation (R. S. D.) was 1. 8 % for 20. 0 μg l− 1 of copper. The preconcentration factor was 100. The robustness of this procedure is demonstrated by the recovery achieved for determination of copper in the presence of several cations. This procedure was applied to the determination of copper in soft drink samples collected in Campinas, SP, Brazil...|$|E

Denuders are sampling devices which have been effectively employed in such partitioning applications. Here we describe and characterise a novel miniature denuder consisting of two multi-channel silicone rubber traps (each 178 mm long, 6 mm o. d. containing 22 silicone tubes), separated by a quartz fibre filter for particle phase collection. The denuder only requires a small portable personal sampling pump to provide <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of ~ 0. 5 L min- 1. Theoretical considerations indicated that the air flow through the denuder was expected to be laminar, and the linear velocity arising from longitudinal diffusion was found to be negligible. The calculated particle transmission efficiency through the denuder was found to be essentially 100 % for particles > 50 nm, whilst the experimental overall efficiency, as determined by CPC and SMPS measurements, was 92 ± 4 %. The size resolved transmission efficiency was < 60 % for particles below 20 nm and 100 % for particles larger than 200 nm. Losses could have been due to diffusion and electrostatic effects. Semi-volatile gaseous analytes are pre-concentrated in the silicone of the trap and may be thermally desorbed using a commercially available desorber, allowing for total transfer and detection of the collected analytes by GC 36 MS. This enhances detection limits and allows for lower <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> and shorter <b>sampling</b> times, which are advantageous for studies requiring high temporal resolution.

40|$|Particulate matter air {{pollution}} demonstrates adverse human health effect {{and is one}} of reasons for the climate change. Monoterpenes are a class of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are often present in household products. They can be produced by a variety of plants and belong to biogenic VOC (BVOC) class. Due to the fact that monoterpenes often contain one or more unsaturated carbon-carbon double bonds, they can readily react with ozone, and some of the products form PM. In order to address the potential health problems caused by the use of household products, climate change, and health effects caused by BVOC emissions, an efficient, precise, accurate and environmental friendly analytical sampling and detection method needs to be developed. In this work, a dynamic solid phase microextraction (SPME) sampling method is coupled with gas chromatography (GC) /mass spectroscopy detection for both single monoterpene and complex monoterpene mixture analysis in the presence of ozone. Not only the effects of parameters such temperature, pressure and relative humidity need to be known, but also how the <b>sampling</b> time, <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> ozone concentration and monoterpene type affects this analysis method are needed. In consideration of the difference between reactive monoterpenes and nonreactive monoterpenes, several single monoterpenes were selected and smog chamber experiments were conducted. The precision of the sampling method at various <b>sampling</b> times, <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> and ozone concentrations were compared for both single monoterpenes and monoterpenes mixture. The <b>sampling</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> had no significant effect on this SPME sampling method. On the contrary, the GC response did have noticeable change when the sampling time and the ozone concentration were varied. A radical scavenger study was conducted and the result indicated that radical scavenger did not {{have a significant effect on}} SPME fiber or the precision and accuracy of sampling method...|$|R
