5|$|Landward {{movement}} of the <b>shingle</b> meant that the channel of the Glaven was becoming blocked increasingly often by 2004. This led to flooding of Cley village and the environmentally important Blakeney freshwater marshes. The Environment Agency considered several remedial options. It concluded that attempting {{to hold back the}} <b>shingle</b> or breaching the spit to create a new outlet for the Glaven would be expensive and probably ineffective, and doing nothing would be environmentally damaging. The Agency decided to create a new route for the river to the south of its original line, and work to realign a 550m (600yd) stretch of river 200m (220yd) further south was completed in 2007 {{at a cost of about}} £1.5million. The Glaven had previously been realigned from an earlier, more northerly, course in 1922. The ruins of Blakeney Chapel are now to the north of the river embankment, and essentially unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing <b>shingle</b> will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of <b>shingle</b> as the spit continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30years.|$|E

50|$|Asbestos <b>shingles</b> are roof or wall <b>shingles</b> {{made with}} {{asbestos}} cement board. They often resemble slate <b>shingles</b> and were mass-produced during the 20th century as these were more resilient to weathering than tradition slate <b>shingles</b> {{for the reason}} that slate is very soft and prone to weathering. Due to health risks of asbestos products, the European Union has banned all use of asbestos, including asbestos roof <b>shingles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Blakeney Point, {{like most}} of the {{northern}} part of the marshes in this area, is part of the parish of Cley next the Sea. The main spit runs roughly west to east, and joins the mainland at Cley Beach before continuing onwards as a coastal ridge to Weybourne. It is approximately 6.4km (4mi) long, and is composed of a <b>shingle</b> bank which in places is 20m (65ft) in width and up to 10m (33feet) high. It has been estimated that there are 2.3millionm3 (82millionft3) of <b>shingle</b> in the spit, 97per cent of which is derived from flint.|$|E
5|$|Robert Mark Realty {{bought the}} former station in 1986 and renovated it {{at a cost}} of $175,000. Work began in October 1987 and was more than halfway done by January 1988. Matt Bialecki, the {{architect}} who had overseen the renovation of the former New Paltz opera house as a restaurant, served as the project's architect. Wilro Builders served as the contractor. The building's design follows a <b>Shingle</b> Style architecture and its sidings are both <b>shingle</b> and clapboard. There are bay windows on the east and west faces, and rafters are partly visible. The building served as a real estate office.|$|E
5|$|As {{infantry}} disembarked {{from the}} landing craft, they often found themselves on sandbars 50 to 100 yards (45 to 90m) out. To reach the beach {{they had to}} wade through water sometimes neck deep, and they still had 200 yards (180m) or more to go when they did reach shore. Those that {{made it to the}} <b>shingle</b> did so at a walking pace because they were so heavily laden. Most sections had to brave the full weight of fire from small arms, mortars, artillery, and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire. Where the naval bombardment set grass fires burning, as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint, the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders. Some sections of G/116 and F/116 were able to reach the <b>shingle</b> bank relatively unscathed, though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers. G/116 was able to retain some cohesion, but this was soon lost {{as they made their way}} westwards under fire along the <b>shingle</b> in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives. The scattering of the boats was most evident on the 16th RCT front, where parts of E/16, F/16 and E/116 had intermingled, making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis-landings. Those scattered sections of E/116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties, although, having encountered a deep runnel after being landed on a sandbank, they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore.|$|E
40|$|When {{the term}} <b>shingles</b> is used, {{one thinks of}} the roofing {{material}} on a house. When asked what <b>shingles</b> could be used for, one again thinks of roofing a house. <b>Shingles</b> are primarily used for that purpose, {{but they can also}} be used for other purposes, such as replacing virgin materials used in mixtures for constructing pavements. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) has taken a look into and studied the use of <b>shingles</b> waste material called Reclaimed Asphalt <b>Shingles</b> (RAS). The city of Chicago and the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (Illinois Tollway) have been using RAS {{for a number of years}} with much success. Now IDOT is moving toward increased use of RAS as a potential cost-savings measure. Projects constructed using RAS have performed adequately during their initial performance period.

50|$|Just {{off the end}} of the Needles {{formation}} is the <b>Shingles,</b> a shifting shoal of pebbles just beneath the waves. The <b>Shingles</b> is approximately three miles in length. Many ships have been wrecked on the <b>Shingles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Further east, the strongpoint {{defenses}} were effective. On the Dog Red / Easy Green boundary, {{the defenses}} around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy {{toll on the}} remaining 2nd Battalion, with H/116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there. The survivors joined the remnants of F/116 behind the <b>shingle,</b> and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the <b>shingle.</b> A further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins {{was too weak to}} have any effect and was forced back down. To their left, mainly between the draws on the Easy Green / Easy Red boundary, the 116th RCT's support battalion landed without too much loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on the bluffs.|$|E
5|$|I {{spend my}} time out in the open, on the <b>shingle</b> beach {{when the weather is}} bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the {{countryside}} which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work all the time, and I believe that this year I am going to do some serious things.|$|E
5|$|The Point {{was formed}} by {{longshore}} drift and this movement continues westward; the spit lengthened by 132.1m (433ft) between 1886 and 1925. At the western end, the <b>shingle</b> curves south towards the mainland. This feature has developed several times over the years, giving the impression from {{the air of a}} series of hooks along {{the south side of the}} spit. Salt marshes have formed between the <b>shingle</b> curves and in front of the coasts sheltered by the spit, and sand dunes have accumulated at the Point's western end. Some of the shorter side ridges meet the main ridge at a steep angle due to the southward movement of the latter. There is an area of reclaimed farmland, known as Blakeney Freshes, to the west of Cley Beach Road.|$|E
50|$|Two basic {{types of}} wood <b>shingles</b> are called <b>shingles</b> and shakes. The {{difference}} is {{in how they}} are made, the <b>shingles</b> are sawn and shakes are split. Wood <b>shingles</b> and shakes have long been known as a fire hazard and have been banned in various places, particularly in urban areas where exterior, combustible building materials contribute to devastating fires known as conflagrations.|$|R
25|$|System <b>shingles.</b> <b>Shingles</b> are pre-manufactured {{rectangular}} or square flat tiles for roofs, walls, {{and individual}} building components. They have 1800 folds along all four borders – two folds towards the external side and two towards the internal side. The <b>shingles</b> are interlocked during installation. The fastening is hidden with stainless steel or copper clips on wood sheeting or trapezoidal panels. Machine notching and folding {{ensures that the}} <b>shingles</b> have uniform dimensions.

5|$|The {{description}} of each waterfall {{starts with the}} name. While the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) Bureau of State Parks names 22 waterfalls in Ricketts Glen State Park (all but Kitchen Creek and <b>Shingle</b> Cabin), the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) names 23 (all but <b>Shingle</b> Cabin), and Scott E. Brown's 2004 book Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers names 24. There are also several unnamed waterfalls in the park, with {{the total number of}} falls given as 33 or 34. For each waterfall the height is given next, followed by the elevation above sea level, and the latitude and longitude. Each waterfall in the table is classified according to the four types used in Brown's book (falls, cascade, slide, and chute), with some classified as combinations of types. For each waterfall there are notes, which can give more information on the waterfall, the etymology of the name, and the location on the Falls Trail, followed by a photograph.|$|E
5|$|The {{island has}} several ayres, or storm beaches, which form narrow spits of <b>shingle</b> or sand cutting across the landward and seaward ends of shallow bays.

50|$|Solar <b>shingles</b> are {{photovoltaic}} modules, capturing {{sunlight and}} transforming it into electricity. Most solar <b>shingles</b> are 12 x 86 in {{and can be}} stapled directly to the roofing cloth. When applied they have a 5 x 86 in strip of exposed surface. Different models of <b>shingles</b> have different mounting requirements. Some can be applied directly onto roofing felt intermixed with regular asphalt <b>shingles</b> while others may need special installation.|$|R
50|$|With William Ruyechan and John Hay, Straus cloned VZV and mapped its genome. They {{showed that}} {{chickenpox}} (varicella) and <b>shingles</b> (herpes zoster) are both caused by this virus.

From Dartmouth, the route uses either the Lower Ferry or Passenger Ferry to cross the river to Kingswear.|$|E
5|$|US 113 {{continues}} through Showell, where the U.S. Highway crosses Church Branch, Middle Branch, and Birch Branch; these three streams together form <b>Shingle</b> Landing Prong of the St. Martin River, which empties into Isle of Wight Bay, a lagoon {{on the west}} side of Ocean City. Within Showell, the highway parallels Old US 113 (unsigned MD 575B), which is accessed at its south end with a right-in/right-out junction with southbound US 113 and full access via <b>Shingle</b> Landing Road. US113 intersects MD367 (Bishopville Road) at Bishop and has an oblique grade crossing with the rail line, then the route intersects the east end of MD610 (Whaleyville Road). The U.S. Highway crosses Carey Branch, which flows into the Bishopville Prong of the St. Martin River, before it enters Delaware at the Transpeninsular Line, one of the lines surveyed as part of the 18th-century Penn–Calvert boundary dispute.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing through}} Porthleven the path crosses the <b>shingle</b> bank of Loe Bar with the {{freshwater}} Loe Pool behind.
