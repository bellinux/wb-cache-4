40|$|During mating of the alga Chlamydomonas, two biflagellate cells fuse to form {{a single}} quadriflagellate cell that {{contains}} two nuclei and a common cytoplasm. We have used this cell fusion during mating to transfer unassembled flagellar components from the cytoplasm of one Chlamydomonas cell into that of another in order to study in vivo the polarity of flagellar assembly. In the first series of experiments, sites of tubulin addition onto elongating flagellar axonemes were determined. Donor cells that had two full-length flagella and were expressing an epitope-tagged alpha-tubulin construct were mated (fused) with recipient cells that had two half-length flagella. Outgrowth of the shorter pair of flagella followed, using a common pool of precursors that now included epitope-tagged tubulin, resulting in quadriflagellates with four full-length flagella. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy using an antiepitope antibody showed that both the outer doublet and central pair microtubules of the recipient cells' flagellar axonemes elongate solely by addition of new subunits at their distal ends. In a separate series of experiments, the polarity of assembly of a class of axonemal microtubule-associated structures, the radial spokes, was determined. Wild-type donor cells that had two full-length, motile flagella were mated with paralyzed recipient cells that had two full-length, radial <b>spokeless</b> flagella. Within 90 min after cell fusion, the previously paralyzed flagella became motile. Immunofluorescence microscopy using specific antiradial spoke protein antisera showed that radial spoke proteins appeared first at the tips of <b>spokeless</b> axonemes and gradually assembled toward the bases. Together, {{these results suggest that}} both tubulin and radial spoke proteins are transported to the tip of the flagellum before their assembly into flagellar structure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Radial spokes of the {{eukaryotic}} flagellum {{extend from}} the A tubule of each outer doublet microtubule toward the central pair microtubules. In the paralyzed flagella mutant of Chlamydomonas pf 14, a mutation in {{the gene for}} one of 17 polypeptides that comprise the radial spokes results in flagella that lack all 17 spoke components. The defective gene product, radial spoke protein 3 (RSP 3), is, therefore, pivotal to the assembly of the entire spoke and may attach the spoke to the axoneme. We have synthesized RSP 3 in vitro and assayed its binding to axonemes from pf 14 cells to determine if RSP 3 can attach to <b>spokeless</b> axonemes.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{addition}} to the previously studied pf- 14 and pf- 1 loci in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, mutations for another five genes (pf- 17, pf- 24, pf- 25, pf- 26, and pf- 27) have been identified and characterized as specifically affecting the assembly and function of the flagellar radial spokes. Mutants {{for each of the}} newly identified loci show selective alterations for {{one or more of the}} 17 polypeptides in the molecular weight range of 20, 000 - 130, 000 which form the radial spoke structure. In specific instances the molecular defect has been correlated with altered radial spoke morphology. Biochemical analysis of in vivo complementation in mutant X wild-type dikaryons has provided indirect evidence that mutations for four of the five new loci (pf- 17, pf- 24, pf- 25, and pf- 26) reside in structural genes for spoke components. In the case of pf- 24, the identity of the mutant gene product was supported by analysis of induced intragenic revertants. In contrast to the other radial spoke mutants thus far investigated, evidence suggests that the gene product in pf- 27 is extrinsic to the radial spokes and is required for the specific in vivo phosphorylation of spoke polypeptides. In the preceding communication (1) analysis of axonemal polypeptides from the radial <b>spokeless</b> mutant, pf- 14, led to th...|$|E

The sole axoneme binding domain of RSP 3 is located within amino acids 1 - 85 of the 516 amino acid protein; deletion of these amino acids abolishes binding by RSP 3. Fusion of amino acids 1 - 85 or 42 - 85 to an unrelated protein confers complete or partial binding activity, respectively, to the fusion protein. Transformation of pf 14 cells with mutagenized RSP 3 genes indicates that amino acids 18 - 87 of RSP 3 are important to its function, but that the carboxy-terminal 140 amino acids can be deleted with little effect on radial spoke assembly or flagellar motility...|$|E
40|$|Genetic, biochemical, and {{structural}} data support {{a model in}} which axonemal radial spokes regulate dynein-driven microtubule sliding in Chlamydomonas flagella. However, the molecular mechanism by which dynein activity is regulated is unknown. We describe results from three different in vitro approaches {{to test the hypothesis}} that an axonemal protein kinase inhibits dynein in spoke-deficient axonemes from Chlamydomonas flagella. First, the velocity of dynein-driven microtubule sliding in spoke-deficient mutants (pf 14, pf 17) was increased to wild-type level after treatment with the kinase inhibitors HA- 1004 or H- 7 or by the specific peptide inhibitors of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) PKI(6 - 22) amide or N alpha-acetyl-PKI(6 - 22) amide. In particular, the peptide inhibitors of cAPK were very potent, stimulating half-maximal velocity at 12 - 15 nM. In contrast, kinase inhibitors did not affect microtubule sliding in axonemes from wild- type cells. PKI treatment of axonemes from a double mutant missing both the radial spokes and the outer row of dynein arms (pf 14 pf 28) also increased microtubule sliding to control (pf 28) velocity. Second, addition of the type-II regulatory subunit of cAPK (RII) to spoke- deficient axonemes increased microtubule sliding to wild-type velocity. Addition of 10 microM cAMP to <b>spokeless</b> axonemes, reconstituted with RII, reversed the effect of RII. Third, our previous studies revealed that inner dynein arms from the Chlamydomonas mutants pf 28 or pf 14 pf 28 could be extracted in high salt buffer and subsequently reconstituted onto extracted axonemes restoring original microtubule sliding activity. Inner arm dyneins isolated from PKI-treated axonemes (mutant strain pf 14 pf 28) generated fast microtubule sliding velocities when reconstituted onto both PKI-treated or control axonemes. In contrast, dynein from control axonemes generated slow microtubule sliding velocities on either PKI-treated or control axonemes. Together, the data indicate that an endogenous axonemal cAPK-type protein kinase inhibits dynein-driven microtubule sliding in spoke-deficient axonemes. The kinase is likely to reside in close association with its substrate(s), and the substrate targets are not exclusively localized to the central pair, radial spokes, dynein regulatory complex, or outer dynein arms. The results are consistent with a model in which the radial spokes regulate dynein activity through suppression of a cAMP- mediated mechanism...|$|E
