40|$|Abstract. It is well {{documented}} that {{the negative effects of}} habitat fragmentation are strong enough to promote local as well as regional extinction of canopy and emergent trees in neotropical forests. However, forest fragmentation does not occur alone, but is always associated with other human-induced threats to trees, such as logging, forest burning and hunting of key vertebrate seed dispersers within forest remnants. This association occurs because forest resources are, at least during a certain period, the main income source for local human populations. It is now possible to establish how these threats act in concert causing tree <b>species</b> <b>impoverishment.</b> Based on a predictive model, it is predicted that the most fragmented forest regions have lost or will lose an important part of their tree diversity. New integrated research must urgently test this prediction and investigate how human activities might be regulated in both old and new tropical forest frontiers to avoid species loss. If we fail to do this we will miss the opportunity of proposing sound and efficient guidelines to rescue neotropical forests from <b>species</b> <b>impoverishment...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{silvicultural}} {{management of}} coppicing {{has been very}} common in deciduous forests in many European countries. After decades of decline of this practice, socio-economic changes might induce a revival valuing the biomass as a resource. New insights in the ecological processes that regulate plant diversity are relevant for a sustainable forest management. While studies on long-term changes are available, the short-term dynamics of the coppice forest understorey {{has not yet been}} explored. In this context, it is interesting to evaluate the species compositional changes, including the processes of species turnover and <b>species</b> <b>impoverishment</b> (nestedness) and to investigate the role of plant functional traits. For this purpose, we resampled a chronosequence of complex coppice beech forests of the Central Apennines (Italy) monitoring the short-time species dynamics of five years (i. e. from 2006 to 2011) in three age classes, i. e. post-logged, recovering and old coppice stands (0 – 16, 17 – 31 and > 32 years, respectively). In contrast to our expectation, declining species richness appeared only in the recovering stands, while the landscape scale (between-stand) heterogeneity, except for post-logged and recovering stands in 2011, did not change over five years. Significant temporal nestedness was found in each stage of succession. However, the rate of species turnover and <b>species</b> <b>impoverishment</b> do not significantly differ among the three age classes, indicating their constant importance along the forest regeneration after disturbance. Only in the early stage of forest regeneration after coppicing, species compositional changes are reflected by functional changes with surviving understorey species having clonal regeneration traits. Our results suggest an overall landscape-scale stability (and sustainability) of this coppice forest system. We conclude with management indications, highlighting the importance of maintaining the traditional local approach (coppicing with standards in small 0. 5 – 1. 0 ha sized management units with a ca 30 -year rotation cycle) where active coppice parcels are interspersed by abandoned stands. © 2017 Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republi...|$|E
40|$|Excess in {{application}} of herbicide such as Aminopielik and Chwastox in cereals crop {{was the cause}} of the increase in cover of some weeds (in particular grass), a few decrease in cover of a cultivated plant, a few decrease of number's <b>species</b> and the <b>impoverishment</b> composition in the Caucalido-Scandicetum association in the "Nadnidziański Landscape Park" area. In the records of the fields where herbicide was applied (tab. 1 : records 11 - 20), the weeds cover surplused cereals cover. Apera spica-venti and sometimes Avena fatua dominated in these records and the number of dicotyledonous species was insignificant. Where herbicides were not applied (tab. l: records 1 - 10), the overall weeds cover was smaller than the cover of a cultivated plant and the weeds number was significantly bigger. In these fields there existed an interspecious competition which didn't allow large development of one or two weed species. The research was made in summer 1997 by the Braun-Blanquet's method in cereals and data of herbicide application taken down...|$|R
40|$|Deforestation {{and forest}} {{fragmentation}} are known major causes of nonrandom extinction, {{but there is}} no information about their impact on the phylogenetic diversity of the remaining species assemblages. Using a large vegetation dataset from an old hyper-fragmented landscape in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest we assess whether the local extirpation of tree <b>species</b> and functional <b>impoverishment</b> of tree assemblages reduce the phylogenetic diversity of the remaining tree assemblages. We detected a significant loss of tree phylogenetic diversity in forest edges, but not in core areas of small (, 80 ha) forest fragments. This was attributed to a reduction of 11 % in the average phylogenetic distance between any two randomly chosen individuals from forest edges; an increase of 17 % in the average phylogenetic distance to closest non-conspecific relative for each individual in forest edges; and to the potential manifestation of late edge effects in the core areas of small forest remnants. We found no evidence supporting fragmentation-induced phylogenetic clustering or evenness. This could be explained by the low phylogenetic conservatism of key life-history traits corresponding to vulnerable species. Edge effects must be reduced to effectively protect tree phylogenetic diversity in the severely fragmented Brazilian Atlanti...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. By {{virtue of}} their {{structural}} and floristic diversity, the riparian corridors of Australia’s savanna woodlands provide unique resources and conditions for the savanna fauna and are characterized by greater vertebrate diversities than the surrounding woodlands (Williams 1994). Riparian vegetation is particularly susceptible to disturbances associated with livestock grazing and invasive species. For example, the highly invasive Rubber Vine (Cryptostegia grandiflora Roxb. Ex R. Br.) is common in tropical Queensland riparian systems where it frequently forms extensive, dense thickets. Degradation of riparian vegetation by heavy livestock grazing and associated infestation by Rubber Vine and other weeds has been implicated in the decline of individual bird <b>species</b> and the <b>impoverishment</b> of vertebrate assemblages generally (Rowley 1993; Kutt & Skull 1995). The fencing of riparian zones is commonly {{considered to be a}} cost-effective method of controlling stock access and associated disturbance to ecologically important riparian areas. Riparian fencing may also help to improve long-term pasture productivity by allowing managers to selectively rest these areas during critical periods of pasture development (Burrows & Butler 2001). A riparian fencing project initiated by Landcare groups in Queensland’s northern Burdekin Rangelands provided the opportunity {{to examine the effects of}} fencing, patch widths and associated environmental conditions on riparian avifauna...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} concern of alien species invading our tropical ecosystems because anthropogenic land use can create conditions in which non-native species thrive. This study is an assessment of bioinvasion using a quantitative survey of non-native plant species in floodplain secondary forests in Peninsular Malaysia. The study area {{is known to have}} a long cultivation and settlement history that provides ample time for non-native species introduction. The survey results showed that introduced species constituted 23 % of all the identified species, with seven species unique to riparian forest strips and eleven species unique to abandoned paddy fields and the remaining five species being shared between the two secondary forest types. There existed some habitat preferences amongst the species implying both secondary forests were potentially susceptible to bioinvasion. Fourteen species are also invasive elsewhere (PIER invasives) whereas fifteen species have acquired local uses such for traditional medicine and food products. The presence of these non-native species could alter native plant succession trajectory, and eventually leads to native <b>species</b> <b>impoverishment</b> if the exotics managed to outcompete the native species. As such, {{the findings of this study}} have a far-reaching application for the national biodiversity conservation efforts because it provides the required information on bioinvasion...|$|E
40|$|Vegetation {{and soil}} seed banks of a {{threatened}} Atlantic fen meadow community were studied using recent phytosociological records and seedling emergence from soil samples. Similarly managed but differently degraded stands that suffered {{different levels of}} <b>species</b> <b>impoverishment</b> were compared. The actual vegetation was related {{to a set of}} phytosociological references representing the subassociations of the community. DCA positions of reference relevés from the different subassociations were overlapping, suggesting that in all references many common species occur. Recent records were positioned in-between the seed bank samples and the references. The soil seed banks of all stands were dominated by ordinary species. Most character species had at most sparse seed banks and no seedlings of locally extinct character species, mentioned in historic floristic records, were detected. In contrast species of pioneer and small-sedge communities {{as well as those of}} heathlands were abundant in the seed banks. Based on the vertical distribution of seeds in the soil layers most fen meadow species were classified into transient or short-term persistent seed bank types. We concluded that complete restoration of the Cirsio dissecti-Molinietum without reintroduction is only likely in stands that were degraded only a few years ago. On the other hand, the presence of viable seeds of Nanocyperion and Parvocaricetea species is promising for the restoration of these communities even after decades. Recreation of pioneer habitats by sod cutting will preserve these species. ...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: The spatial {{correlation}} {{of the presence}} of people and species has been suggested to be scale-dependent. At local scales, large numbers of people often result in <b>species</b> <b>impoverishment.</b> At coarse scales, species-rich regions tend to be densely inhabited. Recently, broad-scale human presence {{has been shown to be}} correlated not only with numbers of species but also with their abundance, as predicted by the more-individuals hypothesis. However, it is not known whether the species abundancehuman presence correlation could also be scale-dependent. Methods: This hypothesis was tested by use of a database of veteran trees in Italy. Veteran tree species richness and number of individuals were modelled as a function of human population size at two grains of analysis (provinces and regions), controlling for variations in area, latitude and spatial autocorrelation. Key Results: A positive correlation was found between human presence and veteran tree species. As predicted, this correlation was stronger at a coarser resolution. However, only at the provincial but not regional level was there a positive correlation between human presence and veteran tree abundance when controlling for area and latitude. These results were confirmed for native and exotic trees. Conclusions: The present findings rule out the more-individuals hypothesis as an explanation of the scale-dependence of the speciespeople correlation for veteran trees in Italy. Potential mechanisms behind the observed spatial coincidence of high numbers of people and veteran tree species are discussed and implications for conservation are highlighte...|$|E
40|$|Dalmatian {{pyrethrum}} (Tanacetum cinerariifolium Trevir. /Sch. / Bip.) is an outcrossing, perennial insecticidal plant, {{restricted to}} the eastern Adriatic coast (Mediterranean). Amplified fragment-length polymorphisms (AFLP) were used to investigate the genetic diversity and structure within and among 20 natural plant populations. The highest level of gene diversity, the number of private alleles and the frequency down-weighted marker values (DW) were found in northern Adriatic populations and gradually decreased towards the southern boundary of the <b>species</b> range. Genetic <b>impoverishment</b> of these southern populations is most likely the result of human-related activities. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated {{that most of the}} genetic diversity was attributed to differences among individuals within populations (85. 78 %), which are expected due to the outcrossing nature of the species. A Bayesian analysis of the population structure identified two dominant genetic clusters. A spatial analysis of the genetic diversity indicated that 5. 6 % of the genetic differentiation resulted from isolation by distance (IBD), while 12. 3 % of the genetic differentiation among populations followed the pattern of isolation by environmental distance (IBED). Knowledge of the genetic diversity patterns of the natural populations and the mechanism behind these patterns is required for the exploitation and possible conservation management of thi...|$|R
40|$|Aquaculture {{is growing}} rapidly in {{response}} to an increasing demand for protein and the over-exploitation of wild fisheries. Mussel (family Mytilidae) production has doubled over the last decade and currently stands at 1. 5 million tones production per annum. Mussels produce organic biodeposits which are dispersed around the production site and, potentially, impact the receiving environment in a number of inter-linked ways. The reported benthic impacts that occur, primarily through the accumulation of these biodeposits and associated organic enrichment, vary widely between studies. The objectives of this research were to determine {{the nature of the relationship}} between sediment redox (a proxy for oxygenation) and farm-proximity and covariables whilst accounting for, and quantifying, differences in redox between sites. Sediment cores (N = 159) were taken remotely around a random sample of mussel farms, redox was measured at 10 mm sediment depth and linked to farm-distance and sediment organic/shell content and particle size, using an additive, mixed, weighted regression model. Redox varied considerably between sites and there was a highly significant reduction (50 mV) in redox adjacent to the mussel lines. Redox increased non-linearly with distance, rising rapidly at > 7 m from the farm edge. The modest reduction in sediment oxygenation in close proximity to mussel farms reported here suggests that farms located over sediments characterised by pre-existing oxygen stress are likely to exacerbate benthic <b>species</b> <b>impoverishment</b> associated with reducing sedimentary conditions whilst those located over highly oxygenated sediments are likely to increase benthic productivity...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the size and}} habitat {{partitioning}} of the vascular floras of five areas of the NE Iberian Peninsula, representing five distinct vegetation belts and three floristic regions: Mediterranean (basal belt), medio-European (submontane and montane belts) and Boreo-Alpine (subalpine and alpine belts). Each area covered over 1000 ha, and was fairly uniform in terms of potential vegetation, bedrock and bioclimate. They excluded large villages and field areas, the landscape being mainly natural or moderately anthropized. The size of the local floras showed a unimodal function with respect to altitude, with {{the highest number of}} species (568) in the submontane belt. The decrease in species richness was moderate toward the neighbouring belts (basal and montane) but more marked from the montane to the subalpine belt and then to the alpine belt (the poorest area, with 217 species). However, considering the size of the areas studied, the montane belt showed higher species richness than the submontane belt. The <b>species</b> <b>impoverishment</b> toward higher altitudes followed general tendencies found in other altitude and latitude gradients, and reflects the increasing environmental constraints and the decreasing habitat diversity of colder landscapes. On the contrary, the richer floras of the submontane and montane areas reflect less stressful general conditions, but also the occurrence within them of a number of taxa from the neighbouring regions (Mediterranean and Boreo-Alpine). The forest flora in the basal to subalpine landscapes accounted for {{a small percentage of the}} local floras (6. 5 - 13. 2 %). Amon...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{diversity}} patterns along environmental gradients {{and their}} underlying mechanisms {{is a major}} topic in current biodiversity research. In this study, we investigate {{for the first time}} elevational patterns of vascular plant species richness and endemism on a long-isolated continental island (Crete) that has experienced extensive post-isolation mountain uplift. We used all available data on distribution and elevational ranges of the Cretan plants to interpolate their presence between minimum and maximum elevations in 100 -m elevational intervals, along the entire elevational gradient of Crete (0 - 2400 m). We evaluate the influence of elevation, area, mid-domain effect, elevational Rapoport effect and the post-isolation mountain uplift on plant species richness and endemism elevational patterns. Furthermore, we test the influence of the island condition and the post-isolation mountain uplift to the elevational range sizes of the Cretan plants, using the Peloponnese as a continental control area. Total species richness monotonically decreases with increasing elevation, while endemic species richness has a unimodal response to elevation showing a peak at mid-elevation intervals. Area alone explains a significant amount of variation in species richness along the elevational gradient. Mid-domain effect is not the underlying mechanism of the elevational gradient of plant species richness in Crete, and Rapoport's rule only partly explains the observed patterns. Our results are largely congruent with the post-isolation uplift of the Cretan mountains and their colonization mainly by the available lowland vascular plant species, as high-elevation specialists are almost lacking from the Cretan flora. The increase in the proportion of Cretan endemics with increasing elevation can only be regarded as a result of diversification processes towards Cretan mountains (especially mid-elevation areas), supported by elevation-driven ecological isolation. Cretan plants have experienced elevational range expansion compared to the continental control area, as a result of ecological release triggered by increased <b>species</b> <b>impoverishment</b> with increasing elevation...|$|E
40|$|Land use {{leads to}} massive habitat {{destruction}} and fragmentation in tropical forests. Despite its global dimensions {{the effects of}} fragmentation on ecosystem dynamics are not well understood due {{to the complexity of}} the problem. We present a simulation analysis performed by the individual-based model FORMIND. The model was applied to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the world`s biodiversity hot spots, at the Plateau of Sao Paulo. This study investigates the long-term effects of fragmentation processes on structure and dynamics of different sized remnant tropical forest fragments (1 - 100 ha) at community and plant functional type (PFT) level. We disentangle the interplay of single effects of different key fragmentation processes (edge mortality, increased mortality of large trees, local seed loss and external seed rain) using simulation experiments in a full factorial design. Our analysis reveals that particularly small forest fragments below 25 ha suffer substantial structural changes, biomass and biodiversity loss in the long term. At community level biomass is reduced up to 60 %. Two thirds of the mid- and late-successional species groups, especially shade-tolerant (late successional climax) species groups are prone of extinction in small fragments. The shade-tolerant species groups were most strongly affected; its tree number was reduced more than 60 % mainly by increased edge mortality. This process proved to be the most powerful of those investigated, explaining alone more than 80 % of the changes observed for this group. External seed rain was able to compensate approximately 30 % of the observed fragmentation effects for shade-tolerant species. Our results suggest that tropical forest fragments will suffer strong structural changes in the long term, leading to tree <b>species</b> <b>impoverishment.</b> They may reach a new equilibrium with a substantially reduced subset of the initial species pool, and are driven towards an earlier successional state. The natural regeneration potential of a landscape scattered with forest fragments appears to be limited, as external seed rain is not able to fully compensate for the observed fragmentation-induced changes. Our findings suggest basic recommendations for the management of fragmented tropical forest landscapes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
