The toxicity of used cigarette filters depends on the specific tobacco blend and additives used by the cigarette companies. After a cigarette is <b>smoked,</b> the <b>filter</b> retains some of the chemicals, and some of which are considered carcinogenic. When studying the environmental impact of cigarette filters, the various chemicals that can be found in cigarette filters are not studied individually, due to its complexity. Researchers instead focus on the whole cigarette filter and its LD50. LD50 is defined as the lethal dose that kills 50% of a sample population. This allows for a simpler study of the toxicity of cigarettes filters. One recent study has looked at the toxicity of <b>smoked</b> cigarette <b>filters</b> (<b>smoked</b> <b>filter</b> + tobacco), <b>smoked</b> cigarette <b>filters</b> (no tobacco), and unsmoked cigarette filters (no tobacco). The results of the study showed that for the LD50of both marine topsmelt (Atherinops affinis) and freshwater fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), <b>smoked</b> cigarette <b>filters</b> + tobacco are more toxic than <b>smoked</b> cigarette <b>filters,</b> but both are severely more toxic than unsmoked cigarette filters.|$|R
40|$|In a case control {{study of}} over 12 000 inpatients aged 35 - 74, risk of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, and, {{particularly}} in those aged 35 - 54, ischaemic heart disease was positively associated {{with the number of}} manufactured cigarettes smoked daily and was negatively associated with long term giving up. Risk of stroke was not clearly related to smoking. Among manufactured cigarette smokers, lung cancer risk tended to be lowest in those who had always <b>smoked</b> <b>filter</b> cigarettes. This pattern was, however, evident only in men who additionally smoked pipes, cigars or handrolled cigarettes and in women, not being seen in men who smoked only manufactured cigarettes. Risk of lung cancer was not clearly related to time of switch to filter cigarettes. A markedly lower risk of chronic bronchitis was seen in men, but not women, who <b>smoked</b> <b>filter</b> rather than plain cigarettes. Heart disease risk did not vary by type of cigarette smoked 10 years before admission, but, compared with those who had never <b>smoked</b> <b>filter</b> cigarettes, those who had ever <b>smoked</b> <b>filter</b> cigarettes had a higher risk in men and a lower risk in younger women. Compared with the general population, markedly more controls were ex-smokers, suggesting incipient disease, whether or not smoking related, may alter smoking habits, thus affecting the interpretability of the findings. Control smokers were also relatively much more likely to report smoking plain cigarettes than expected. This comparison, not made in other studies relating risk to type of cigarette smoked, indicates that great care must be taken in verifying validity of reported smoking habits. While our findings are compatible with other evidence that risk of lung cancer and chronic bronchitis is probably reduced by switching from plain to filter cigarettes, they underline the difficulties in obtaining valid evidence from epidemiological studies...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, the {{incidence}} of adenocarcinoma (AC) of the lung increased much more rapidly than that of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in men and women. During this time period, filter cigarettes with substantially reduced ââtarââ and nicotine yields in the smoke came to dominate the market. METHODS. The risk of SCC and AC in lifelong smokers of filter cigarettes relative to lifelong nonfilter cigarette smokers was assessed in a case-control study performed between 1977 and 1995 with 2292 lung carcinoma patients and 1343 hospital controls who were current smokers. RESULTS. Odds ratios (OR) for SCC in male and female subjects who had <b>smoked</b> <b>filter</b> cigarettes exclusively during their lives were slightly reduced relative to lifetime nonfilter cigarette smokers in men (OR. 0. 8; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 5 â 1. 2), and significantly reduced in women (OR = 0. 4; 95 % CI, 0. 2 â 0. 8). No reduction in risk was observed for AC of the lung in men or women. CONCLUSIONS. Evidence that the increasing predominance of AC over SCC may be {{due in part to}} the reduced risk of SCC (but not AC) associated with lifelong filter cigarette smoking is strongest in women; for men, further studies that include larger numbers of lifetime filter smokers are needed to confirm this finding.

A caseâcontrol study was carried out to as-sess the impact of long-term filter cigarette smoking on the risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and ad-enocarcinoma (AC) of the lung. Results.
