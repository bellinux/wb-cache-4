40|$|ABSTRACT Although several {{theories}} {{assert that}} understanding the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning {{in life is}} important, empirical research on this construct is sparse. Three studies provide the first extensive effort to understand the correlates of the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning in a multistudy research program. Assessed were relations between <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning and wellbeing, cognitive style, and the Big Five, Big Three, Approach/Avoidance, and Interest models of personality, with a particular emphasis on understanding the correlates of <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning that are independent of presence of meaning. Conceptual models {{of the relation between}} search and presence were tested. Findings suggest that people lacking meaning <b>search</b> <b>for</b> it; the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning did not appear to lead to its presence. Study 3 found that basic motive dispositions moderated relations between <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning and its presence. Results highlight the importance of basic personality dispositions in understanding the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning and its correlates. Several investigations have recently reaffirmed the link between meaning in life and well-being (e. g., King, Hicks, Krull, & Del...|$|R

After its defeat, half-vampire and half-zombie creatures known as Vambees appear in the nearby village.

While Musashi <b>searches</b> <b>for</b> the Fire Scroll, Musashi's rival, Kojiro, kidnaps Princess Fillet and uses her as a hostage to force a battle with Musashi. Kojiro is defeated and Fillet is then rescued. Musashi then <b>searches</b> <b>for</b> thieves from the Thirstquencher Empire and makes his way to the next crest guardian. It is then revealed that Princess Fillet is actually one of Thirstquencher's thieves disguised and that the real Fillet is still in their hands.

40|$|The <b>search</b> <b>for</b> {{meaning in}} {{life has been}} {{considered}} a fundamental human motivation (Frankl, 1963). Although research has pointed toward {{the importance of the}} <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning in life, the basic processes through which it emerges remain unclear. Because the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning entails schema formation in which one connects individual experiences into a coherent framework (Steger, Oishi, & Kesebir, 2011), and abstract thought instigates the organization of information into such knowledge structures (Trope & Liberman, 2010), we predicted that abstract thought would increase the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning in life. Moreover, we predicted that figuratively removing oneself from the here and now would also heighten the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning. Importantly, we predicted that because schema formation is effortful (Shallice & Burgess, 1996), abstract thought and psychological distance would increase the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning to a greater extent when willingness to exert effort is high rather than low. Nine experiments corroborated these predictions, supporting a view of the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning as motivated social cognition...|$|R
