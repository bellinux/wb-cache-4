However, these points are critical for understanding the dynamic formation process when the standing layer is created by the moving front of the rolling matter or when the latter is filling a cavity and/or stops rolling.

40|$|Mesh {{refinement}} is {{the problem}} to produce a triangulation (typically Delaunay) of an input set of points augmented by Steiner points, such that every triangle has good quality (no small angles).

The FEM approximation is shown to converge at the rate O(h^ 2 /ϵ^ 2). The improved rate of convergence allows us to select h on the same order as ϵ.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the evolution of implicit or explicit surfaces. The first part of this thesis addresses three problems in fluid simulation: advection, thin film, and the volume error. First, we show that the back and forth error compensation and correction (BFECC) method can significantly reduce the dissipation and diffusion. Second, thin film is hard to simulate since it has highly complex liquid/gas interface that requires high memory and computational costs. We address this difficulties by using cell centered octree grid to reduce memory cost and a multigrid method to reduce computational cost. Third, the volume loss is an undesired side effect of the level set method. The known solution to this problem is the particle level set method, which is expensive and has small but accumulating volume error. We provide a solution that is computationally effective and can prevent volume loss without accumulation. The second part of this thesis is focused on filtering a triangle mesh to produce a mesh whose details are selectively reduced or amplified. We develop a mesh filter with a rational transfer function, which is a generalization from previously developed mesh filters. In addition, we show that the mesh filter parameters can be computed from the physical <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>mesh</b> feature. Ph. D.
