5|$|Outside {{the temple}} {{building}} proper was the temple enclosure, {{surrounded by a}} rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected the <b>sacred</b> <b>space</b> from outside disorder. On occasion this function was more than symbolic, especially during the last native dynasties {{in the fourth century}} BC, when the walls were fully fortified in case of Persian invasion. In late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses of bricks, so that the top of the wall undulated vertically. This pattern may have been meant to evoke the mythological waters of chaos.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{causeway}} was a large hall leading to a pillared open court surrounded by magazine chambers. The court led into the mortuary temple proper which housed statues of the king and where the offerings to the deceased took place. This was immediately adjacent to {{the eastern side of the}} pyramid, which was surrounded by an enclosure wall defining the <b>sacred</b> <b>space.</b> At the southeast corner of the enclosure was a small satellite pyramid for the Ka of the king. The internal chambers of the pyramid were entered in 1881 by Gaston Maspero, who thus discovered the pyramid texts. The burial chamber housed nothing but a black basalt sarcophagus sunk into the floor and a canopic chest. The sarcophagus proved to contain scattered bones, which may belong to Unas.|$|E
5|$|Solsticial {{alignments}} {{also can}} be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the Island of the Sun (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in Lake Titicaca, the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the <b>sacred</b> <b>space</b> was restricted to members of the Inca ruling elite. Ordinary pilgrims stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.|$|E

50|$|Religious {{experiences}} {{and the belief}} in religious meanings transforms physical <b>spaces</b> into <b>sacred</b> <b>spaces.</b> These perceptions and imaginings influence the way such spaces are used, and the personal, spiritual meanings developed in using such <b>sacred</b> <b>spaces.</b> These religiously significant spaces go beyond officially religious/spiritual spaces (such as places of worship) to include non-official religious spaces such as homes, schools and even bodies. These works have focused on both material aspects of spaces (such as architectural distinctiveness) and socially constructed spaces (such as rituals and demarcation of <b>sacred</b> <b>spaces)</b> to present religious meaning and significance.|$|R

5|$|The {{requirements}} for the priesthood differed over time and among the cults of different gods. Although detailed theological knowledge was involved in priestly offices, {{little is known about}} what knowledge or training may have been required of the officeholders. Priests were required to observe strict standards of ritual purity in the <b>sacred</b> <b>space.</b> They shaved their heads and bodies, washed several times a day, and wore only clean linen clothing. They were not required to be celibate, but sexual intercourse rendered them unclean until they underwent further purification. The cults of specific gods might impose further restrictions related to that god's mythology, such as rules against eating the meat of an animal that represented the god. The acceptance of women into the priesthood was variable. In the Old Kingdom many women served as priests, but their presence in clergies declined drastically in the Middle Kingdom before increasing in the Third Intermediate Period. Lesser positions, such as that of musician in ceremonies, remained open to women in even the most restrictive periods, as did the special role of ceremonial consort of the god. This latter role was highly influential, and {{the most important of these}} consorts, the God's Wife of Amun, even supplanted the High Priest of Amun during the Late Period.|$|E

40|$|The {{last ten}} years our design-office has {{received}} more than twenty-five assignments to design new <b>sacred</b> <b>spaces.</b> Most of the questions in these assignments are open and vague.

The features ‘people-form-spirituality’ are in permanent ‘trialogue’ and are deepening, challenging and inspiring each other. The design-assignments of <b>sacred</b> <b>spaces</b> are situated in a forcefield made by two axis: a first axis of projects from a traditional to a new context and another axis of spiritual-conceptual projects to community-forming projects.

25|$|By ancient tradition, {{presiding}} magistrates sought divine {{opinion of}} proposed actions through an augur, {{who read the}} divine will through the observation of natural signs in the <b>sacred</b> <b>space</b> (templum) of sacrifice. Magistrates could use their right of augury (ius augurum) to adjourn and overturn the process of law, but were obliged to base their decision on the augur's observations and advice.

25|$|They may, for example, have {{originated}} in India from the torana gates in the monastery of Sanchi in central India. According to this theory, the torana {{was adopted by}} Shingon Buddhism founder Kūkai, who used it to demarcate the <b>sacred</b> <b>space</b> used for the homa ceremony. The hypothesis arose in the 19th and 20th centuries due to similarities in structure and name between the two gates.

25|$|With 621,000 Jews in the {{metropolitan}} area (490,000 in city proper), the region has the second largest population of Jews in the United States. Many of Los Angeles's Jews now live on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley, though Boyle Heights and Northwest Los Angeles once had large Jewish populations. Many varieties of Judaism are represented in the area, including Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, and Reconstructionist. The Breed Street Shul in East Los Angeles, built in 1923, was the largest synagogue west of Chicago in its early decades. (It is no longer a <b>sacred</b> <b>space</b> and is being converted to a museum and community center.) The Kabbalah Centre also has a presence in the city.|$|E
25|$|In India, {{a kitchen}} {{is called a}} “Rasoi” or a “Swayampak ghar” (in Hindi/Sanskrit), and there exist many other names {{for it in the}} various {{regional}} languages. Many different methods of cooking exist across the country, and the structure and the materials used in constructing kitchens have varied depending on the region. For example, in north and central India, cooking used to be carried out in clay ovens called “Chulhas”, fired by wood, coal or dried cowdung. In households where members observed vegetarianism, separate kitchens were maintained to cook and store vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. Religious families often treat the kitchen as a <b>sacred</b> <b>space.</b> Indian kitchens are built on an Indian architectural science called vastushastra. The Indian kitchen vastu is of utmost importance while designing a kitchens in India. Modern-day architects also follow the norms of vastushastra while designing Indian kitchens across the world.|$|E
