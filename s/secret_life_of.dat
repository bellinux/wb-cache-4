5|$|Inside Out opened across 3,946 {{theaters in}} the United States and Canada, of which 3,100 showed {{the film in}} 3D. It grossed $3.7 million during its Thursday night showings. This was a record among Pixar films that had Thursday night showings, but behind Toy Story 3s $4 million midnight showing. The film then earned $34.3 million on its opening day, which is the third largest opening day for a Pixar film behind Toy Story 3 ($41.1 million) and Finding Dory ($54.7 million). It ended its opening weekend in second place with $90.4 million, behind the second weekend gross of dinosaur thriller Jurassic World ($106.6 million). Although it was Pixar's first film not to debut at No. 1, its opening weekend gross was still the biggest for a Pixar {{original}} film (breaking The Incredibles record), the studio's third biggest of all time (behind Finding Dory and Toy Story 3), the biggest weekend debut for a film that did not debut at No. 1 (breaking The Day After Tomorrows record), and the top opening for any original film, live-action or otherwise, not based on sourced material, eclipsing the $77 million debut of Avatar (overtaken by The <b>Secret</b> <b>Life</b> <b>of</b> Pets). The film's successful opening {{has been attributed to}} its Cannes premiere, CinemaCon press screening, its 98% Rotten Tomatoes score, good word-of-mouth, Father's Day weekend, and a successful Tuesday night Fathom screening. In its second weekend, the film fell by 42% to $52.3 million and still held the second spot behind Jurassic World; {{the rest of the week}} saw it slightly ahead of the latter. Inside Out reached the No. 1 spot at the box office in its third weekend with $29.8 million. Overall, IMAX contributed 10% or $36 million (as of September 4, 2015) of its total North American revenue.|$|E
