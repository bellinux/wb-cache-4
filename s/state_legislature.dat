5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the <b>state</b> <b>legislature.</b> It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed the <b>state</b> <b>legislature</b> {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere with the war effort or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E

5|$|In 1885 the Democrats redistricted the Indiana <b>state</b> <b>legislature,</b> which {{resulted}} in an increased Democratic majority in 1886, despite an overall Republican majority statewide. In 1887, {{largely as a result}} of the Democratic gerrymandering of Indiana's legislative districts, Harrison was defeated in his bid for reelection. Following a deadlock in the state senate, the <b>state</b> <b>legislature</b> eventually chose Democrat David Turpie as Harrison's successor in the U.S. Senate. Harrison returned to Indianapolis and resumed his law practice, but stayed active in state and national politics.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} inaugural speech in August 1816, Jennings called {{attention}} to the need for an educational plan. In his 1817 annual message to the <b>state</b> <b>legislature,</b> he encouraged the establishment of a free, state-funded education system, as called for in the state constitution, but few of the state's citizens were willing to impose taxes to fund public schools. The <b>state</b> <b>legislature</b> believed priority should be given to creating government infrastructure. Lack of public funds postponed creation of a state library system until Governor James B. Ray's administration in 1826.|$|E

The proposal would raise between $700 million to $800 million, with $250 of it going for half-priced MetroCards for 800,000 riders at or below the poverty line, a shift from de Blasio's previous stance. To go into effect, {{it would have to be}} approved by the New York <b>State</b> <b>Legislature.</b> This proposal was criticized by Governor Cuomo and MTA Chairman Joe Lhota for not providing money soon enough, the <b>State</b> <b>Legislature</b> does not go back into session until January 2018.|$|E

5|$|Mary Leonard {{became the}} first woman {{admitted}} to the state bar on April 13, 1886, when the court admitted her after a year-long battle that included the <b>state</b> <b>legislature</b> passing a new law to allow women to be admitted. In 1906, the Oregon court upheld a maximum hour law for women in State v. Muller, 48 Or. 252, 85 P. 855 (1906). Due partly to a brief by future U.S. Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Oregon law in Muller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412 (1908) despite ruling in 1905 in Lochner v. New York that a maximum hour law for bakers was unconstitutional. Then in 1910, the <b>state</b> <b>legislature</b> expanded the court back to five justices, and lastly, in 1913 the court expanded to the current seven justices.|$|E

25|$|In the {{earliest}} presidential elections, state legislative choice {{was the most}} common method of choosing electors. A majority of the <b>state</b> <b>legislatures</b> selected presidential electors in both 1792 (9 of 15) and 1800 (10 of 16), and half of them did so in 1812. Even in the 1824 election, a quarter of <b>state</b> <b>legislatures</b> (6 of 24) chose electors. In that election, Andrew Jackson lost in spite of having pluralities of both the popular and electoral votes, with the outcome being decided by the six <b>state</b> <b>legislatures</b> choosing the electors. Some <b>state</b> <b>legislatures</b> simply chose electors, while other states used a hybrid method in which <b>state</b> <b>legislatures</b> chose from a group of electors elected by popular vote. By 1828, with the rise of Jacksonian democracy, only Delaware and South Carolina used legislative choice. Delaware ended its practice the following election (1832), while South Carolina continued using the method until it seceded from the Union in December 1860. South Carolina used the popular vote {{for the first time in}} the 1868 election.|$|R
40|$|This article {{attempts}} to {{shed some light}} on an unintended consequence of the term limit movement, its likely impact on the representation of women and minorities in <b>state</b> <b>legislatures.</b> There has {{been a great deal of}} discussion recently about limiting the terms of elected officials. In 1990, 3 states, California, Colorado, and Oklahoma, led the way in adopting term limits for their <b>state</b> <b>legislatures.</b> The purpose of this research is to analyze extant characteristics and trends in the <b>state</b> <b>legislatures</b> to help inform the discussion of the effect of term limits on two groups who are presently underrepresented in most <b>state</b> <b>legislatures,</b> women and minorities. Proponents of term limits contend that <b>state</b> <b>legislatures</b> are becoming too much like the U. S. Congress, replete with the same problems: career politicians more concerned with their own electoral safety than the welfare of the people. It is argued that term limits will open up the legislature to new faces and fresh ideas, by diminishing the power of long-time incumbents, whom many view as being unduly influenced by special interests...|$|R
