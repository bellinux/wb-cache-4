This causes greater field losses as the grain falls from the heads, and to harvesting losses, as the grain is threshed out by the reel. Without a draper head, there is also more damage to the straw, since it is not properly oriented as it enters the combine's throat. Overall yield loss is 10–15% compared to proper <b>swathing.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Harvest {{techniques}} are {{a matter of}} available equipment, local tradition, and priorities. Farmers seeking the highest yield from their crops time their harvest so the kernels have reached 35% moisture, or when the greenest kernels are just turning cream-colour. They then harvest by <b>swathing,</b> cutting the plants at about [...] above ground, and putting the swathed plants into windrows with the grain all oriented the same way. They leave the windrows to dry in the sun for several days before combining them using a pickup header. Finally, they bale the straw.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Jambres {{will now}} take the chair,' said Leonora, and the wizard, his <b>swathing</b> robes bulging with Leonora's securities, glided forward.|$|E
60|$|We presented, indeed, {{a strange}} spectacle, for the mage, in his silvery <b>swathings,</b> held Leonora by the hands, and Leonora held me, as we raced through the gloom.|$|R
60|$|So {{indeed it}} proved, for the mage began rapidly to divest himself of his mysterious <b>swathings.</b> Wrapper by wrapper he undid, cerement on cerement, till both Leonora and I {{wondered}} {{when he would}} stop.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{color is}} not dark enough, sahib. I have brought dye with me; but first I must dress the wound on your head, and bandage it more neatly, {{so that the}} blood stained <b>swathings</b> will not show below the folds of your turban." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is my cloak," [...] she asked, as on setting {{her down}} she {{perceived}} the deficiency; [...] "and {{what are those}} ugly things?" [...] {{and she looked at}} the <b>swathing</b> round her arms and legs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold your tongue!" [...] said Michael. He dashed to {{the house}} door and locked it; then, with a pale face and bitten lip, he drew near, pulled aside {{a corner of the}} <b>swathing</b> blanket, and recoiled, shuddering.|$|E
60|$|Streams {{of living}} {{radiance}} came rushing and flashing round about him, <b>swathing</b> him with light, as the lightning sometimes enwraps and dashes against the blinded eyes; {{but the light}} was love here, and instead of injuring, gave new power to the object it embraced.|$|E
60|$|For a space Kemp was too inarticulate to make Adye {{understand}} the swift {{things that had}} just happened. They stood on the landing, Kemp speaking swiftly, the grotesque <b>swathings</b> of Griffin still on his arm. But presently Adye began to grasp something of the situation.|$|R
60|$|Matthew had sheepishly {{unfolded}} {{the dress}} from its paper <b>swathings</b> {{and held it}} out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be contemptuously filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene {{out of the corner of}} her eye with a rather interested air.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are {{the pink}} and gold vases Grandmother King gave her," [...] said Felicity, as Aunt Olivia {{unwrapped}} from their tissue paper <b>swathings</b> {{a pair of}} slender, old-fashioned, twisted vases of pink glass, over which little gold leaves were scattered. [...] "Aren't they handsome?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{spirit of}} colour was {{flying in the}} distant trees, <b>swathing</b> them with brownish-purple haze; the sky was saffroned by dying sunlight. It was such a day as brings a longing to the heart, like that which the moon brings to the hearts of children.|$|E
60|$|He {{went into}} the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat. The others, taken aback by his rude speech, could find nothing to say. Aunt Kate {{wrinkled}} her brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject. Mr. D'Arcy stood <b>swathing</b> his neck carefully and frowning.|$|E
60|$|Above {{all this}} region was still another, of black pines and crags; the pines going up, and up, and up, till they looked {{no larger than}} pin feathers; and surmounting all, straight, {{castellated}} turrets of rock, looking out of <b>swathing</b> bands of cloud. A narrow, dazzling line of snow crowned the summit.|$|E
60|$|Back in {{the kitchen}} at home Mrs. Bell {{was waiting for her}} husband to bring the horse to the door. She was a slight, dark-eyed little woman, with thin, vivid-red cheeks. From out of the <b>swathings</b> in which she had wrapped her bonnet, her face gleamed sad and troubled. Now and then she sighed heavily.|$|R
60|$|Also, sixteen is {{an awkward}} age for a boy. Virtues, {{still in the}} {{chrysalis}} state, are struggling to escape from their parent vices. Pride, an excellent quality making for courage and patience, still appears in the <b>swathings</b> of arrogance. Sincerity still expresses itself {{in the language of}} rudeness. Kindness itself is apt to be mistaken for amazing impertinence and love of interference.|$|R
6000|$|As {{the only}} male person present was the Boshman, this {{appeared}} to me a futile question, and even the stately Magician seemed to be struck by some dim idea of the kind, for I could discern a pair of mysterious eyes peering anxiously through his <b>swathings,</b> and I heard him mutter to himself in several languages, 'Ought to have thought of that. No hat present. Don't know any trick to produce one. Nothing {{about it in the}} book.' ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a blazing}} fire ready, {{and all the}} baby comforts of the time provided, and poor little Lady Arbell was {{relieved}} from her <b>swathing</b> bands, and allowed to stretch her little limbs on her nurse's lap, the one rest really precious to babes of all periods and conditions--but the troubles were not yet over, for the grandmother, glancing round, demanded, [...] "Where is the cradle inlaid with pearl? Why was it not provided? Bring it here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Elspat {{started up}} like one awakened from the dead, {{and without any}} {{accurate}} recollection of the scene which had passed before her eyes. There were females in the hut who were <b>swathing</b> the corpse in its bloody plaid before carrying it from the fatal spot. [...] "Women," [...] she said, starting up and interrupting their chant at once and their labour--"Tell me, women, why sing you the dirge of MacDhonuil Dhu {{in the house of}} MacTavish Mhor?" ...|$|E
60|$|Redwood {{remained}} {{standing in the}} doorway {{for a long time after}} the carriage had passed, his hands folded behind him. His eyes went to the green, grey upland of down, and into the cloud-curdled sky, and came back to the glass-set wall. He turned upon the cool shadows within, and amidst spots and blurs of colour regarded the giant child amidst that Rembrandtesque gloom, naked except for a <b>swathing</b> of flannel, seated upon a huge truss of straw and playing with its toes.|$|E
6000|$|The {{scene is}} slowly illumined as by dawn. SEELCHEN is still [...] {{lying on the}} window seat. She sits up, freeing her face and [...] hands from the blankets, {{changing}} the <b>swathings</b> of deep sleep [...] for the filmy coverings of a dream. The wall of the hut has [...] vanished; there is nothing {{between her and the}} three mountains [...] veiled in mist, save a through of darkness. There, as the peaks [...] of the mountains brighten, they are seen to have great faces.|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} {{only in the}} fragmentary stage of {{conversation}} when everything was thrown into commotion by the important arrival of Lady Frensham, {{and there was a}} general reshuffling of places. Lady Frensham had arrived from London by automobile; she appeared in veils and <b>swathings</b> and a tremendous dust cloak, with a sort of nephew in her train who had driven the car. She was manifestly a constitutionally triumphant woman. A certain afternoon lassitude vanished in the swirl of her arrival. Mr. Philbert removed wrappings and handed them to the manservant.|$|R
6000|$|The winter {{pictures}} are less numerous and satisfactory. He wears huge sabots--no doubt of beechwoods and (as {{fragments of the}} inscription [...] "John Stickells, Iping," [...] show) sacks for socks, and his trousers and jacket are unmistakably cut from {{the remains of a}} gaily patterned carpet. Underneath that there were rude <b>swathings</b> of flannel; five or six yards of flannel are tied comforter-fashion about his neck. The thing on his head is probably another sack. He stares, sometimes smiling, sometimes a little ruefully, at the camera. Even when he was only five years old, one sees that half whimsical wrinkling over his soft brown eyes that characterised his face.|$|R
60|$|October is come, {{and among}} the black glooms of the pine forests flare out the scarlet {{branches}} of the rock-maple, and the beech-groves are all arrayed in gold, through which the sunlight streams in subdued richness. October is come with long, bright, hazy days, <b>swathing</b> in purple mists the rainbow brightness of the forests, and blending the otherwise gaudy and flaunting colors into wondrous harmonies of splendor. And Moses Pennel's ship is all built and ready, waiting only a favorable day for her launching.|$|E
6000|$|... "They will {{certainly}} be misled," [...] Letton agreed, his eerie gray eyes blazing out from the voluminous folds of the huge Mueller with which he was <b>swathing</b> his neck to the ears. [...] "Their minds run in ruts. It is the unexpected that upsets their stereotyped calculations--any new combination, any strange factor, any fresh variant. And you will be all that to them, Mr. Harnish. And I repeat, they are gamblers, and they will deserve all that befalls them. They clog and cumber all legitimate enterprise. You {{have no idea of}} the trouble they cause men like us--sometimes, by their gambling tactics, upsetting the soundest plans, even overturning the stablest institutions." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was because}} he had talked long with the steward who had left the ship, that Dag Daughtry {{recognized}} and identified {{each of the four}} men. That, surely, was the [...] "Ancient Mariner," [...] sitting back and apart with washed eyes of such palest blue that they seemed a faded white. Long thin wisps of silvery, unkempt hair framed his face like an aureole. He was slender to emaciation, cavernously checked, roll after roll of skin, no longer encasing flesh or muscle, hanging grotesquely down his neck and <b>swathing</b> the Adam's apple so that only occasionally, with queer swallowing motions, did it peep out of the mummy-wrappings of skin and sink back again from view.|$|E
60|$|That is all I {{can tell}} definitely. I saw the Leopard-man strike Moreau, and then {{everything}} spun about me until I was running headlong. M'ling was ahead, close {{in pursuit of the}} fugitive. Behind, their tongues already lolling out, ran the Wolf-women in great leaping strides. The Swine folk followed, squealing with excitement, and the two Bull-men in their <b>swathings</b> of white. Then came Moreau in a cluster of the Beast People, his wide-brimmed straw hat blown off, his revolver in hand, and his lank white hair streaming out. The Hyena-swine ran beside me, keeping pace with me and glancing furtively at me out of his feline eyes, and the others came pattering and shouting behind us.|$|R
60|$|She {{wanted to}} live. She was vehemently impatient--she did not clearly know for what--to do, to be, to {{experience}}. And experience was slow in coming. All {{the world about}} her seemed to be--how can one put it?--in wrappers, like a house when people leave it in the summer. The blinds were all drawn, the sunlight kept out, one could not tell what colors these gray <b>swathings</b> hid. She wanted to know. And there was no intimation whatever that the blinds would ever go up or the windows or doors be opened, or the chandeliers, that seemed to promise such a blaze of fire, unveiled and furnished and lit. Dim souls flitted about her, not only speaking but it would seem even thinking in undertones....|$|R
6000|$|Then, suddenly, came a sound, {{like the}} sound of a tolling bell: faint, as if {{infinitely}} far; muffled, as though heard through thick <b>swathings</b> of darkness: a deep, vibrating resonance, with vast gulfs of silence between each stroke. And the Hand appeared to tighten on the rod. And I saw far above the Hand, towards the apex of the darkness, a circle of dim phosphorescence, a ghostly sphere whence these sounds came throbbing; and at the last stroke the Hand vanished, for the hour had come, and I heard a noise of many waters. But the black rod remained as a great band across the sky. And then a voice, which seemed to run to the uttermost parts of space, spoke, saying, [...] "There will be no more pain." ...|$|R
6000|$|Universal as {{are certain}} facts and {{symptoms}} of communities [...] there is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as their [...] normal recognizance. Literature is always calling in the doctor for [...] consultation and confession, and always giving evasions and <b>swathing</b> [...] suppressions in place of that ‘heroic nudity’ on which only a genuine [...] diagnosis [...] . can be built. And in respect to editions of Leaves [...] of Grass in time to come (if there should be such) I take occasion [...] now to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and [...] deliberate renewals of thirty years, and to hereby prohibit, as far [...] as word of mine can do so, any elision of them.|$|E
6000|$|It {{came back}} then afresh to that, {{as it had}} come before. Milly, three minutes after Kate had gone, {{returned}} in her array--her big black hat, so little superstitiously in the fashion, her fine black garments throughout, the <b>swathing</b> of her throat, which Densher vaguely took for {{an infinite number of}} yards of priceless lace, and which, its folded fabric kept in place by heavy rows of pearls, hung down to her feet like the stole of a priestess. He spoke to her at once of their friend's visit and flight. [...] "She hadn't known she'd find me," [...] he said--and said at present without difficulty. He had so rounded his corner that it wasn't a question of a word more or less.|$|E

60|$|While {{engaged in}} these, {{she wore a}} species of sightly {{handkerchief}} like a turban upon her head and about her person those mystical <b>swathings</b> in which old ladies of the African race delight. But she most pleasured our sense of beauty and moral fitness when, after the last pan was washed and the last pot was scraped, she lighted a potent pipe, and, taking her stand at the kitchen door, laded the soft evening air with its pungent odors. If we surprised her at these supreme moments, she took the pipe from her lips, and put it behind her, with a low mellow chuckle, and a look of half-defiant consciousness; never guessing that none of her merits took us half {{so much as the}} cheerful vice which she only feigned to conceal.|$|R
60|$|After {{that they}} sent for a litter and they laid Sir Launcelot upon the litter and bare him {{away into the}} Castle of Corbin where King Pelles of Corbin was then holding his court in royal pomp of circumstance. And they brought Sir Launcelot to a fair chamber of the castle where a number of attendants came to him and eased him of his armor and {{led him to a}} bath of tepid water steeped with healing herbs. And there came a skilful leech and searched the wounds of Sir Launcelot and spread {{soothing}} unguents upon them and bound them up with <b>swathings</b> of linen. And after that they bare Sir Launcelot to a fair soft couch spread with snow-white linen and laid him thereon, and he was greatly at ease and much comforted in body.|$|R
60|$|I stopped {{just in time}} {{to prevent}} myself {{emerging}} upon an open space. It was a kind of glade in the forest, made by a fall; seedlings were already starting up to struggle for the vacant space; and beyond, the dense growth of stems and twining vines and splashes of fungus and flowers closed in again. Before me, squatting together upon the fungoid ruins of a huge fallen tree and still unaware of my approach, were three grotesque human figures. One was evidently a female; the other two were men. They were naked, save for <b>swathings</b> of scarlet cloth about the middle; and their skins were of a dull pinkish-drab colour, such as I had seen in no savages before. They had fat, heavy, chinless faces, retreating foreheads, and a scant bristly hair upon their heads. I never saw such bestial-looking creatures.|$|R
