5|$|The Battle of Bardia {{brought to}} the fore the {{simmering}} hostility between regular officers and reservists. Frank Berryman, the 6th Division's General Staff Officer (Grade 1), and Alan Vasey, the Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DA), were eager for Robertson to do well and show that Staff Corps officers could make good commanders, and if {{that could be done}} at the expense of an old-style reservist like Stanley Savige, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> better. They pushed for Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade, then in reserve, to be committed when the attack by Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade slowed down. The abrupt manner in which this was done generated antipathy between Robertson and Savige.|$|E

25|$|The 1998 {{home run}} race had {{generated}} nearly unbroken positive publicity, but Barry Bonds' {{run for the}} all-time home run record provoked a backlash over steroids, which increase a person's testosterone level and subsequently enable that person to bodybuild with much more ease.

25|$|Just as he {{had done}} with his other children, Jean Petipa began giving the young Marius lessons in ballet at the age of seven. At first the young boy resisted, caring very little for dance.

25|$|It was a {{supposedly}} Berber Jewish woman Dahiyah, or Damia (mistaken identity), {{better known as}} Kahina, who aroused her people in the Aures, the eastern spurs of the Atlas Mountains in Algeria, to a last although fruitless resistance to the Arab general Hasan ibn an-Nu'man. As in the Hellenic lands of Christendom, so also in Mauretania, Judaism involuntarily prepared the way for Islam; and {{the conversion of the}} Berbers to Islam took place <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> more easily.

25|$|The main {{contribution}} of Alpha to the microprocessor industry, {{and the main}} reason for its performance, was not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> architecture but rather its implementation. At that time (as it is now), the microchip industry was dominated by automated design and layout tools. The chip designers at Digital continued pursuing sophisticated manual circuit design {{in order to deal with}} the overly complex VAX architecture. The Alpha chips showed that manual circuit design applied to a simpler, cleaner architecture allowed for much higher operating frequencies than those that were possible with the more automated design systems. These chips caused a renaissance of custom circuit design within the microprocessor design community.|$|E
25|$|The {{procession}} of Holy Wednesday and Good Friday features close to forty pasos de misterios or carrozas and draws a huge crowd as spectators and participants as heirlooms images and newly commissioned ones are brought out. What sets it {{apart from other}} Semana Santa processions in the province is not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> number of carrozas, but the solemnity and decorum on how it is done. The Hermandad de la Sagrada Pasion {{is the first in}} the province to have initiated the narration of the passion in dramatized form as the pasos are brought out to the streets. This is a rite that was eventually copied {{by the rest of the}} towns in Bulacan.|$|E

25|$|Singing is an {{integrated}} and coordinated act {{and it is}} difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in, intensively, on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.|$|E
25|$|The Faculty of Philosophy (Faculty of Liberal Arts in the {{traditional}} sense) was established {{three years after the}} Olomouc College got University rights. Englishman George Warr professed the first lecture on logics on 3 October 1576. From the beginning it was teaching the liberal arts, the Trivium (grammar, rhetoric, dialectics) which led to the Baccalaureus degree, and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy) which led to the Magister degree. Sharing the fate of Theological faculty in years 1618–1621, it saw a great revival with not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> field of philosophy, but the fields of science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, cartography and finally also genetics being pursued by notable persons connected to the Faculty (however these fields are today read at the Faculty of Science). Following the Olomouc University students' participation in 1848 revolution the Faculty of Philosophy {{was the first one to}} be suppressed by the Habsurgs in 1851. It was reestablished in 1946. With 1953 establishment of the School of Education of Olomouc the Palacký University Faculty of Philosophy was dissolved until being reopened in 1958.|$|E
25|$|He says {{religion}} has always stopped the philosophers and scientists from gaining knowledge because the Christian religion {{is opposed to}} any knowledge that differs from Biblical knowledge.

He writes in his Philosophy of Religion If at the present day philosophy be an object of enmity because it occupies itself with religion, this cannot really surprise us {{when we consider the}} general character of the time. Every one who attempts to take to do with the knowledge of God, and by the aid of thought to comprehend His nature, must be prepared to find, that either no attention will be paid to him, or that people will turn against him and combine to oppose him. The more the knowledge of finite things has increased and the increase is so great that the extension of the sciences has become almost boundless, and all regions of knowledge are enlarged to an extent which makes a comprehensive view impossible <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> more has the sphere of the knowledge of God become contracted.|$|E
