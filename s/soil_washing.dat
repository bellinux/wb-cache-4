They asked the regulatory bodies to prosecute the company. With these demands, public interest groups led by Greenpeace campaign head Shahul spooked the annual general body meeting of Hindustan Unilever in 2004. Consequently, the company began working with the regulatory body Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to remediate the soil, de-contaminate and scrap the thermometer-making equipment at the Kodaikanal site. The company appointed National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to finalise the scope for remediation, which was vehemently opposed by environmentalists. In 2006, the plant, machinery and materials used in thermometer manufacturing at the site were decontaminated and disposed off as scrap to industrial recyclers. In the following year, NEERI conducted trials at the factory for remediation of the contaminated soil on site, and recommended a remediation protocol of <b>soil</b> <b>washing</b> and thermal retorting. These were hotly contested by environmental groups under the leadership of Nityanand Jayaraman. Ultimately, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) recommended a remediation standard of up to 20 mg/kg of mercury concentration in soil, which means 95% of the samples analysed after the remediation process should be of less than 20 mg/kg. Consequently, pre-remediation work started in May 2009.|$|E

During nZVI-aided dechlorination, the effects of nZVI dosage, initial pH level and temperature were evaluated, respectively. The results showed that the nZVI dosage of 7. 5 g nZVI/kg led to the maximum PCB dechlorination rate. Adding more nZVI could cause particle aggregation, and thus, lower the PCB dechlorination rate.
