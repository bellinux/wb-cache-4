40|$|Copper {{chalcopyrite}} is {{a promising}} {{candidate for a}} photocathode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting because of its high half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (HC-STH), relatively simple and low-cost preparation process, and chemical stability. This paper reviews recent advances in copper chalcopyrite photocathodes. The PEC properties of copper chalcopyrite photocathodes have improved fairly rapidly: HC-STH values of 0. 25 % and 8. 5 % in 2012 and 2015, respectively. On the other hand, the onset potential remains insufficient, owing to the shallow valence band maximum mainly consisting of Cu 3 d orbitals. In order to improve the onset potential, we explored substituting Cu for Ag and investigate the PEC properties of <b>silver</b> <b>gallium</b> <b>selenide</b> (AGSe) thin film photocathodes for varying compositions, film growth atmospheres, and surfaces. The modified AGSe photocathodes showed a higher onset potential than copper chalcopyrite photocathodes.

Continuous-wave optical parametric oscillators (cw OPOs) fulfill these demands; however, their mid-infrared tuning range {{has been limited}} to wavelengths below 5. 5 μm so far. Here, we demonstrate the first cw OPO emitting mid-infrared light at wavelengths up to 8 μm.

Temperature variation enables 100 -nm-wide wavelength tuning. The measured tuning branches are in good accordance with the simulations. Furthermore, the latter show that whispering-gallery OPOs based on AgGaSe 2 with diameters around 2 mm can generate idler waves exceeding the 10 μm wavelength...|$|E
