25|$|Hanley {{was often}} criticized for his union's {{close ties to}} {{organized}} crime. In 1977, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) <b>said</b> <b>HERE</b> was {{a classic example of}} organized crime's control over a major labor union. DOJ also alleged that Hanley's election as president of the union was assisted by Chicago crime boss Joey Aiuppa. Hanley denied the accusation.|$|E
25|$|In some {{much later}} {{writings}} by Tolkien from 1959–60 Eöl was a Mornedhel, an Avar, who {{descended from the}} same Second Clan of the Elves as the Noldor, the Tatyar. It is <b>said</b> <b>here</b> that his sword-craft surpasses the Noldor of Aman. Eöl hates and envies his Valinorean cousins, for their arrogance and condescension, {{as well as their}} knowledge and accomplishment. Eöl's love for smithying and friendship towards the Dwarves is consistent with Tolkien's view of the Noldor, which are described as Dwarf-friends in the First and Second Ages.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study of}} the Amerindian ancestry of Argentines was headed by Argentine {{geneticist}} Daniel Corach of the University of Buenos Aires. The {{results of this study}} in which DNA from 320 individuals in 9 Argentine provinces was examined showed that 56% of these individuals had at least one Amerindian ancestor. Another study on African ancestry was also conducted by the University of Buenos Aires in the city of La Plata. In this study 4.3% of the 500 study participants were shown to have some degree of African ancestry. Nevertheless, it must be <b>said</b> <b>here</b> that this type of genetic studies -meant only to search for specific lineages in the mtDNA or in the Y-Chromosome, which do not recombine- may be misleading. For example, a person with seven European great-grandparents and only one Amerindian/Mestizo great-grandparent will be included in that 56%, although his/her phenotype will most probably be Caucasian.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 467 {{he was one of}} the comites who {{accompanied}} the new emperor of the West, Anthemius, to Italy with a large army. In 468 we see him with the title of patrician which was given to him by Anthemius. Some explaining needs to be <b>said</b> <b>here,</b> since at this time Ricimer still held magister utriusque militum and patrician according to the fasti, and it appears Atheminus wished for Marcellinus to have the similar power held by Ricimer in order to be a counterbalance to him. In the East, it was established practice for both magistri militum praesentales to be equal but in the West it had become common for one magister, (usually the magister peditum), to be superior over the other and so this may have been an attempt by Anthemius to introduce the eastern structure and rule like an eastern emperor using the successful and trustworthy Marcellinus as his second commander.|$|E
500|$|In {{the prologue}} to his Prose Edda, Snorri Sturluson euhemerises Thor as a prince of Troy, {{and the son}} of king Memnon by Troana, a {{daughter}} of Priam. Thor, also known as Tror, is said to have married the prophetess Sibyl (identified with Sif). Thor is further <b>said</b> <b>here</b> to have been raised in Thrace by a chieftain named Lorikus, whom he later slew to assume the title of [...] "King of Thrace", to have had hair [...] "fairer than gold", and to have been strong enough to lift ten bearskins.|$|E
2500|$|What is <b>said</b> <b>here</b> applies also to two {{families}} of set theories: {{on the one}} hand, a range of theories including Zermelo set theory near {{the lower end of}} the scale and going up to ZFC extended with large cardinal hypotheses such as [...] "there is a measurable cardinal"; and on the other hand a hierarchy of extensions of NFU which is surveyed in the New Foundations article. These correspond to different general views of what the set-theoretical universe is like, and it is the approaches to implementation of mathematical concepts under these two general views that are being compared and contrasted.|$|E

Yes, they <b>said,</b> <b>here's</b> £20,000. They thought the sun shone out of my arse at the time. They'd have given me money to animate a toilet if I'd asked them.|$|R
