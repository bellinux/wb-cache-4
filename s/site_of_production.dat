5|$|The cytosol has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of cytokinesis, after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in mitosis. Another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> to where they are used. This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or sterols, can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken into the cell by endocytosis or on their way to be secreted can also be transported through the cytosol inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins.|$|E
5|$|The ER has {{a central}} role in producing, processing, and {{transporting}} biochemical compounds for use inside and outside of the cell. Its membrane is the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> of all the transmembrane proteins and lipids for most of the cell's organelles, including the ER itself, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, endosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane. Furthermore, almost all of the proteins that will exit the cell, plus those destined for the lumen of the ER, Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes, are originally delivered to the ER lumen. Consequently, many of the proteins found in the cisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen are there only temporarily as they pass on their way to other locations. Other proteins, however, constantly remain in the lumen and are known as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. These special proteins contain a specialized retention signal made up of a specific sequence of amino acids that enables them to be retained by the organelle. An example of an important endoplasmic reticulum resident protein is the chaperon protein known as BiP which identifies other proteins that have been improperly built or processed and keeps them from being sent to their final destinations.|$|E

50|$|Bony fishes obtain calcium {{directly}} from their aquatic surrounding (unlike other vertebrates which acquire from diet), {{so that they}} require separate endocrine organ. The corpuscles of Stannius are the <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> the hormone called stanniocalcin (the mammalian homologue is called stanniocalcin-1 or STC1). This hormone is responsible for decreasing the blood circulating level of calcium. Similar to parathyroid hormone and calcitonin that regulate calcium metabolism in mammals, stanniocalcin {{is influenced by the}} level of circulating calcium. When calcium level increases, the corpuscles are stimulated to secrete stanniocalcin.|$|R
25|$|The Philippines is a <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> {{for many}} {{clothing}} brands sold overseas. Rene Ofreneo states {{the presence of}} the Philippines in manufacturing clothing and garments has waned in recent years. Ofreneo notes in the 1990’s, the production of clothing led to the fashion industry employing the largest number of Filipino employees, while also being the second biggest export of the country. He later signifies in 1995, eighty percent of the garments produced by the Philippines ended up being sold to either the U.S., Europe (specifically the European Union) and Canada. The growth of the clothing manufacturing industry in the Philippines was aided by the Multi Fibre Arrangement, otherwise known as MFA, enacted in 1975 and ending in 2004. The arrangement instituted quotas on developing countries regarding the amount of textiles and garments they could export. Since its expiration, the number of goods sent to the USA and other countries has decreased. The amount of workers in the textile industry has decreased by a great amount, employing 1,000,000 workers in the early 1990's to only 100,000 as of 2010. There are numerous complications in the legislative process that have caused a great deal of stress for Philippine manufacturers and the economy of the Philippines as a whole.|$|E

Since the <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 <b>production</b> (pyruvate dehydrogenase and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) and of fixation (carbamoylphosphate synthetase) are intramitochondrial, {{it is likely that}} the fixation of CO 2 is also more rapid than its equilibration with the cytoplasmic pool of bicarbonate plus CO 2.

40|$|Nereis virens is {{an errant}} polychaete which lives in sand {{galleries}} that it rarely leaves. Most {{of the authors}} studying its feeding behavior consider this annehid to be carnivorous or almost omnivorous (Copeland and Wieman, 1924; Case, 1962; Goerke, 1971 a, b; Kay, 1972; Tenore and Gopalan, 1974). Several of these authors succeeded in feeding the annehid with pieces of mollusc or polychaete flesh which are offered {{at the opening of}} the gallery. The worm grips the food with its powerful paired jaws and takes it into its burrow before ingestion. This carnivor ous mode of feeding suggests that the digestive tract of the worm must be equipped with a complement of proteohytic enzymes for digestion of the flesh food bolus. A trypsin-like enzyme has been extracted and purified from the digestive fluid of Nereis brandli (DeVihhez and Reid, 1971) and characterized as a homogen eous component. In a study of distribution of digestive enzymes in the digestive tract of Nereis virens (Kay, 1974), the oesophageal pouches (caeca) and the anterior region of the intestine were proposed as main <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> pro teohytic enzymes. In histochemical tests, most endo- and exo-peptidase activities were associated with the pouches and anterior intestinal regions, whereas the oesophagus showed very weak activity.

40|$|Corporations {{operating}} in labour-intensive industries like garment and athletic footwear often use spatial strategies {{to break away}} from locations of high social conflict: whenever workers gain collective power and wages start to increase, brands and manufacturers seek to safeguard their profit rates by moving into new regions where ‘green’ work forces can be found with no experience in organising. The search for fresh <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> provides an ‘external solution’, for an emerging crisis of profitability and/or labour control at existing sites. This strategy also created a crisis of legitimacy for global brands as stories detailed a range of labour rights abuses, poor conditions, and abusive management at the new <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Under pressure <b>of</b> the global anti-sweatshop movement a number of leading brands propose an alternative strategy: one that is based on improving productivity at existing sites.

40|$|Games are {{woven into}} webs of {{cultural}} meaning, social connection, politics, and economic change.

The authors ground their explorations in findings from ethnographic research on gaming in urban China. The spread of Internet access and increasing popularity of digital entertainment in China has been used as an indicator of social change and economic progress shaped by global flows. It has also been described as being limited by local forces such as tight information control. As such, gaming technologies in China are ideal to ask broader questions about digital media as <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> at the intersection of local contingencies and transnational developments...|$|R
