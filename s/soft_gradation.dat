Nearly all other kinds of wood may be reduced, over large spaces, to undetailed masses; {{but there is nothing}} but patience for pines; and this {{has been one of the}} principal reasons why artists call Switzerland [...] "unpicturesque." [...] There may perhaps be, in the space of a Swiss valley which comes into a picture, from five to ten millions of well grown pines.[94] Every one of these pines must be drawn before the scene can be. And a pine cannot be represented by a round stroke, nor by an upright one, nor even by an angular one; no conventionalism will express a pine; it must be legitimately drawn, with a light side and a dark side, and a <b>soft</b> <b>gradation</b> from the top downwards, or it does not look like a pine at all. Most artists think it not desirable to choose a subject which involves the drawing of ten millions of trees; because, supposing they could even do four or five in a minute, and worked for ten hours a day, their picture would still take them ten years before they had finished its pine forests. For this, and other similar reasons, it is declared usually that Switzerland is ugly and unpicturesque; but that is not so; it is only that we cannot paint it. If we could, it would be as interesting on the canvas as it is in reality; and a painter of fruit and flowers might just as well call a human figure unpicturesque, because it was to him unmanageable, as the ordinary landscape-effect painter speak in depreciation of the Alps.|$|E
40|$|As for {{terrestrial}} remote sensing, pixel-based classifiers {{have traditionally}} been used to map coral reef habitats. For pixel-based classifiers, habitat assignment {{is based on the}} spectral or textural properties of each individual pixel in the scene. More recently, however, object-based classifications, those based on information from a set of contiguous pixels with similar properties, have found favor with the reef mapping community and are starting to be extensively deployed. Object-based classifiers have an advantage over pixel-based in that they are less compromised by the inevitable inhomogeneity in per-pixel spectral response caused, primarily, by variations in water depth. One aspect of the object-based classification workflow is the assignment of each image object to a habitat class {{on the basis of its}} spectral, textural, or geometric properties. While a skilled image interpreter can achieve this task accurately through manual editing, full or partial automation is desirable for large-scale reef mapping projects of the magnitude which are useful for marine spatial planning. To this end, this paper trials the use of multinomial logistic discrete choice models to classify coral reef habitats identified through object-based segmentation of satellite imagery. Our results suggest that these models can attain assignment accuracies of about 85 %, while also reducing the time needed to produce the map, as compared to manual methods. Limitations of this approach include misclassification of image objects at the interface between some habitat types due to the <b>soft</b> <b>gradation</b> in nature between habitats, the robustness of the segmentation algorithm used, and the selection of a strong training dataset. Finally, due to the probabilistic nature of multinomial logistic models, the analyst can estimate a map of uncertainty associated with the habitat classifications. Quantifying uncertainty is important to the end-user when developing marine spatial planning scenarios and populating spatial models from reef habitat maps...|$|E
6000|$|I {{took her}} hand, this time, {{before she was}} aware of me. The whole woman seemed to yield at my touch. Her hand lay unresistingly in mine; her charming figure came by <b>soft</b> <b>gradations</b> nearer and nearer to me; her head almost touched my shoulder. She murmured in faint accents, broken by sighs, [...] "Don't take {{advantage}} of me. I am so friendless; I am so completely in your power." [...] Before I could answer, before I could move, her hand closed on mine; her head sunk on my shoulder: she burst into tears.|$|R
5000|$|A 2012 exhibit catalog noted Gallagher's {{strength}} as a watercolorist:“Gallagher had a proclivity for calm and peaceful places, and he rendered images that elicit the feelings evoked by his {{sites in the}} viewer. He did so {{by the use of}} flowing washes of harmonious color and by holding detail to a minimum so as to sustain unity across a pictorial surface. Avoiding strong contrasts and abrupt spatial transitions, he favored <b>soft</b> tonal <b>gradations</b> and measured distances. The influences of impressionism on his art may be seen in his frequent use of animated and summary brushwork to express transitory aspects of nature and in his tendency to incorporate the tone of his paper’s reserves in a work as means of adding the sparkle of sunlight to a scene. Overall his art is characterized by an understated restraint, as he sought to emphasize the beauty of his subjects over a display of his technical versatility." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{only sound}} beside {{the rustle of}} the fern before the startled deer was the soft mysterious treble of the wind as it swept over {{the face of the}} cliff beneath us; but the cool air was {{confined}} to the hill- tops round beneath, from within a short distance of the shore, the sea was shrouded in soft summer haze. The far Atlantic lay like an ocean of white wool, out of which the Hartland Cliffs and the highest point of Lundy just showed their black peaks. Here and there the western sun caught one white bank of mist after another, and tinged them with glowing gold; while nearer us long silvery zigzag tide- lines, which we could have fancied the tracks of water-fairies, wandered away under the smoky grey-brown shadows of the fog, and seemed to vanish hundreds of miles off into the void of space, so completely was all notion of size or distance destroyed by the <b>soft</b> <b>gradations</b> of the mist. Suddenly, as we stood watching, a breeze from the eastward dived into the basin of the bay, swept the clouds out, packed them together, rolled them over each other, and hurled them into the air miles high in one Cordillera of snowy mountains, sailing slowly out into the Atlantic; and behold, instead of the chaos of mist, the whole amphitheatre of cliffs, with their gay green woods and spots of bright red marl and cold black ironstone, and the gleaming white sands of Braunton, and the hills of Exmoor bathed in sunshine, so near and clear we almost fancied we could see the pink heather-hue upon them; and the bay one vast rainbow, ten miles of flame-colour and purple, emerald and ultramarine, flecked with a thousand spots of flying snow. No one knows what gigantic effects of colour even our temperate zone can show, till they have been in Devonshire and Cornwall; and last, but not least, in Ireland--the Emerald Isle, in truth. No stay-at-home knows the colour of the sea till he has seen the West of England; and no one, either stay-at-home or traveller, I suspect, knows what the colour of a green field can be till he has seen it among the magic smiles and tears of an Irish summer shower in county Down.|$|R
40|$|This file last {{viewed in}} Adobe Reader 7. 0 Artist’s Statement: The work {{represented}} {{in this show}} was created over an eleven-year time span. The content within the pieces reflect upon three unrelated autobiographical events or themes {{but there are two}} points of view, sometimes happening simultaneously: {{the point of view of}} the scientist shown in image selection, and the feminine point of view seen in image execution. The hand of the woman artist is seen tending both the image and the subject within, metaphorically evident in the soft sheen of silk, hand sewn stitches. On the surface, disengagement (the perspective of the scientist) seems at odds with the role of the artist. Taking a deeper look at the pieces here, I think the audience will find that these works go beyond illustration to make connections about processes: biological, ecological and sometimes even emotional ones. However, I must admit I am not formally trained in the sciences, merely an observant artist who took the time to research a subject before commenting on it visually. For the viewer trained in aesthetics, you will find silverpoint and graphite drawings that attempt exactingly accurate representations of their subjects, rich with <b>soft</b> value <b>gradations,</b> texture, and implied motion. Graphic relief prints are filled with rhythmic patterns and bold linear qualities always mindful of fields of value breaking up the space. For the viewer trained in the biological sciences, you will find an artist who took the time to get it right. It encompasses the point of view of the physician using radiographic images, dissections and sutures. The point of view of the ecologist is seen in representations of interrelationships of an ecosystem dependent on soil, hydrology, host plants and companion plants. Surely the botanist will appreciate the lateral striations in the leaf of a rush usually only noticed under a microscope. However, if representational accuracy were the singular goal of this work, they would be high quality illustrations. My desire is that these images go beyond documenting the subject and show an interpretation by the artist to describe unseen processes: the process of illness, injury,birth, fire, relationships in nature and the struggle to understand it all at a deeper level. Perhaps Allen Carlson describes the duality of this show best: “If to appropriately aesthetically appreciate art we must have knowledge of art forms, classifications of works, and artistic traditions, then to appropriately aesthetically appreciate nature we must have knowledge of different natural environments and of the different systems and elements within those environments. As the knowledge provided by art critics and art historians equips us to aesthetically appreciate art, that provided by naturalists, ecologist, geologists, and natural historians equip us to aesthetically appreciate nature. ” [...] “Aesthetic Appreciation and the Natural Environment” (1988...|$|R
