500|$|The folio and the {{illustrated}} Shakespeare edition were [...] "by far {{the largest}} single engraving enterprise ever undertaken in England". As print collector and dealer Christopher Lennox-Boyd explains, [...] "had there not been a market for such engravings, {{not one of the}} paintings would have been commissioned, and few, if any, of the artists would have risked painting such elaborate compositions". Scholars believe that a variety of engraving methods were employed and that line engraving was the [...] "preferred medium" [...] because it was [...] "clear and hardwearing" [...] and because it had a high reputation. <b>Stipple</b> <b>engraving,</b> which was quicker and often used to produce shading effects, wore out quicker and was valued less. Many plates were a mixture of both. Several scholars have suggested that mezzotint and aquatint were also used. Lennox-Boyd, however, claims that [...] "close examination of the plates confirms" [...] that these two methods were not used and argues that they were [...] "totally unsuitable": [...] mezzotint wore quickly and aquatint was too new (there would not have been enough artists capable of executing it). Most of Boydell's engravers were also trained artists; for example, Bartolozzi was renowned for his stippling technique.|$|E
