40|$|Abstract: We present {{evidence}} of ground motion detected {{in and around}} Lisbon with Radar Interferometry (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry- PSI). The work {{was done in the}} <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>GMES</b> Terrafirma project, and two datasets of PSI data were used, with different orbital tracks. The first, provided by Tele Rilevamento Europa, is a standard TRE's PSInSAR processing chain H 1 map of the Lisbon area. It covers the period from 1992 to 2003 and uses 55 Synthetic Aperture Radar Scenes from the ESA satellites ERS 1 / 2 (orbital track 452, descending pass). The second set of data spans the period 1992 - 2006 and was provided by Altamira Information: it consists of (1) a standard SPN H 1 product map of the area to the South of Lisbon, and (2) the result of running the SPN medium resolution processor for the Lisbon area and northwards. The Altamira maps were produced using 100 SAR scenes from both ERS 1 / 2 and ENVISAT satellites (orbital track 223, descending pass). The delivered PSI maps give, for the spanned period, the mean velocity (in the line of sight of the satellite) and velocity time series for over 500. 000 points in the area. The PSI maps were interpolated, detrended, contrast-enhanced, and compared with mapped geological features, soil classes, aeromagnetic and gravimetric data. At a regional scale, the results show a correlation between deep geological features inferred from geophysical techniques and psi-derived velocity patterns. At a more local scale, the main results are the detection of an area of ground subsidence (~ 6 Km 2) in the centre of Lisbon, and of another area possibly affected by slope movement in the north of Lisbon, close to the main highway. 1...|$|E

Two new generation bubble counters, introduced in the early 2000 s, claim correct sizing and counting <b>of</b> <b>GME.</b> This in-vitro study aims to validate the accuracy of two bubble counters using monodisperse bubbles in a highly controlled setting at low GME concentrations. Monodisperse GME with a radius of 43 µm were produced in a microfluidic chip. Directly after their formation, they were injected one-by-one into the BCC 200 and the EDAC sensors. GME size and count, measured with the bubble counters, were optically verified using high-speed imaging. During best-case scenarios or low <b>GME</b> concentrations <b>of</b> <b>GME</b> with a size of 43 µm in radius in an in-vitro setup, the BCC 200 overestimates GME size by a factor of 2 to 3 while the EDAC underestimates the average GME size by at least a factor of two. The BCC 200 overestimates the GME concentration by approximately 20 % while the EDAC overestimates the concentration by nearly one order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the calculated total GME volume is only over-predicted by a factor 2 since the EDAC underestimates the actual GME size. For the BCC 200, the total GME volume was over-predicted by 25 times due to the over-estimation <b>of</b> <b>GME</b> size. The measured errors in the absolute sizing/counting <b>of</b> <b>GME</b> do not imply that all results obtained using the bubble counters are insignificant or invalid. A relative change in bubble size or bubble concentration can accurately be measured. However, care must be taken in the interpretation of the results and their absolute values.

40|$|After {{decades of}} declining numbers of Scottish Gaelic speakers, Gaelic-medium {{education}} (GME) in primary schools {{has become a}} significant tool of Gaelic language revitalization efforts since the mid- 1980 s. Providing initially total and later partial immersion in the language, GME is intended to boost the number of Gaelic speakers in Scotland, and to provide institutional legitimacy to a code whose decline has been blamed on institutionalized discrimination and the symbolic domination of its speakers. Overall, graduates <b>of</b> <b>GME</b> {{have proven to be}} academically accomplished and to display a high degree of formal competence in Gaelic, GME-socialized children thus appear well-poised to overcome the social and symbolic restrictions on speaking Gaelic of the past, and to reverse the long-lasting decline of the language. However, outside of school, GME-socialized children rarely use Gaelic with adult speakers of the language who habitually use English with them because they do not recognize the children’s speech as Gaelic, or claim that their Gaelic cannot be understood. This dissertation examines the language socialization experiences of children enrolled in GME in a rural primary school on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland in order to identify the source of this communicative impasse. It argues that the introduction <b>of</b> <b>GME</b> has changed Scottish Gaelic language socialization from a domestic experience to a school-based educational enterprise with far-reaching consequences for the continued existence of the Gaelic language community. The language ideologies at the heart <b>of</b> <b>GME</b> as an educational model based on the example of institutionalized schooling using standard languages, as well as the prevalent pedagogical practices of its teachers, create forms of communicative competence in GME-socialized pupils that either have no currency in the surrounding community, or offend the political and aesthetic sensibilities <b>of</b> Gaelic-socialized speakers. <b>GME’s</b> focus on imparting literacy skills and developing academic competence in Gaelic further reduces the opportunities for children to develop competence in the linguistic practices and social-linguistic variation that {{are at the heart of}} older speakers’ usage of the language. This calls into question the effectiveness of school-based language immersion programs as tools of language revitalization efforts...|$|R

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen ongoing debate {{regarding}} federal support of graduate medical education, with numerous proposals for reform. Several critical problems with the current mechanism are evident on reviewing graduate medical education (GME) funding issues {{from the perspectives of}} key stakeholders. These problems include the following: substantial interinstitutional and interspecialty variations in per-resident payment amounts; teaching costs that have not been recalibrated since 1983; no consistent control by physician educators over direct medical education (DME) funds; and institutional DME payments unrelated to actual expenditures for resident education or to program outcomes. None <b>of</b> the current <b>GME</b> reform proposals adequately address all of these issues. Accordingly, we recommend several fundamental changes in Medicare GME support. We propose a re-analysis of the true direct costs of resident training (with appropriate adjustment for local market factors) to rectify the myriad problems with per-resident payments. We propose that Medicare DME funds go to the physician organization providing resident instruction, keeping DME payments separate from the operating revenues of teaching hospitals. To ensure financial accountability, we propose that institutions must maintain budgets and report expenditures for each GME program. To establish educational accountability, Residency Review Committees should establish objective, annually measurable standards for GME program performance; programs that consistently fail to meet these minimum standards should lose discretion over GME funds. These reforms will solve several long-standing, vexing problems in Medicare GME funding, but will also uncover the extent <b>of</b> undersupport <b>of</b> <b>GME</b> by most other health care payers. Ultimately, successful reform <b>of</b> <b>GME</b> financing will require “all-payer” support...|$|R
40|$|Tools {{based on}} global motion {{estimation}} (GME) {{have been adopted}} by the MPEG- 4 standard. Estimating global motion parameters tends to be computationally intensive, due to the involvement of all the pixels in the calculation. If real time video coding using GME is required, then fast and accurate GME techniques are critical. Our previous work has shown that fast GME could be achieved by choosing a small subset <b>of</b> pixels for <b>GME,</b> by following certain subsampling patterns. However, GME based on these subsampling methods often suffer from loss in motion estimation accuracy. On the other hand, the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>GME</b> depends heavily on outlier rejection, which seeks to detect and eliminate those pixels (outliers) that do not follow the general pattern of the global motion. In the MPEG- 4 standard, about 10 % of the outlier pixels are skipped in the GME. Therefore, interestingly, outlier rejection could also lead to modest reduction in the computational complexity <b>of</b> the <b>GME.</b> In this paper, we show how to achieve faster and more accurate GME, by integrating pixel subsampling into the outlier rejection process <b>of</b> a conventional <b>GME</b> method. Simulation results showed that, at a subsampling ratio of 1 / 4, the proposed method could achieve about three times of speedup over the conventional GME method that uses outlier rejection alone, while attaining an average estimation accuracy slightly higher than the conventional method.
