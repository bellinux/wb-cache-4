50|$|Generally, {{silviculture}} is {{the science}} and art of growing and tending forest crops, based on a knowledge of <b>silvics,</b> i.e., {{the study of the}} life history and general characteristics of forest trees and stands, with particular reference to locality factors. More particularly, silviculture is the theory and practice of controlling the establishment, composition, constitution, and growth of forests. No matter how forestry as a science is constituted, the kernel of the business of forestry has historically been silviculture, as it includes direct action in the forest, and in it all economic objectives and technical considerations ultimately converge. The focus of silviculture is regeneration, but more recently, recreational use of forestland has challenged silviculture as the primary income generation from forests, due to increasing recognizance of forestland's use for leisure and recreation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:Ecological relationships-including {{habitat and}} life history [...] -of giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum [Lindl. ] Buchholz) in natural stands are summarized. Such silvical {{information}} provides an important foundation for sound {{management of the}} species. <b>Silvics</b> {{is defined by the}} Society of American Foresters (Ford-Robertson 1971, p. 240) as "the study of the life history and general characteristics of forest trees and stands, with particular reference to locality factors, as a basis for the practice of silviculture. " <b>Silvics</b> deals primarily with ecological relationships of trees in natural stands. Consequently, the degree to which some specific subject areas of <b>silvics</b> apply directly to management of a species depends on the type of management-i. e., how far the management practice departs from natural stand processes. Management of giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum [Lindl. ] Buchholz) covers a wide spectrum. Because the species has broad public appeal and a restricted natural range, most groves of giant sequoia have been accorded protected status. In these groves, which generally are managed to maintain the functioning of natural processes, the silvical characteristics summarized in this paper are in large part directly applicable to management. Elsewhere, both within and outside the natural range of the species, giant sequoia is managed for other purposes, such as timber production. Where intensive timber management is practiced, for example, a manager might have limited interest in the characteristics of older trees, associated vegetation occurring in natural stands, and some aspects of natural regeneration (if regeneration is to be achieved through planting). Nevertheless, many aspects of the <b>silvics</b> of giant sequoia comprise an essential foundation for any form of sound management of the species and, as a bonus, tell the ecological story of a fascinating species...|$|E

40|$|Windfalls {{are caused}} by the {{interaction}} of several factors and occur in a meteorological context characterized mainly by high wind speeds. In the present study we tried to develop a method for predicting windfalls in a test region, determining areas of high susceptibility of this climatic risk. For this purpose we evaluated parameters regarding the morphometric (slope, exposition, altitude) and morphological (mountain side concavity/convexity, slope break) properties of the relief, the types of forest and the soil on which these grow. We gave susceptibility scores for each parameter considered, resulting {{in a series of}} classified layers. These were subsequently added up to form the final cartographic material which highlights the vulnerable areas. For validating the results we utilised LandSat images from different time periods. The existence of a major windfalls event in the studied region (March 2002) allowed us to compare the situation before and after the event, and to check if there is a correlation with the model developed in this analysis. On the basis of this study {{it may be possible to}} predict the future evolution of trees susceptibility to windfall which could be helpful in establishing <b>silvic</b> measures to be implemented in order to minimize the damage caused by these phenomena...|$|R

Though the life-histories of many North American boreal forest tree species are well known, little comparable information has been compiled in English for the major boreal forest tree species of the Soviet Union. In this paper, we present a preliminary description of the <b>silvics</b> of seven of these species [...] their ranges, optimum climatic and soil conditions, regeneration characteristics, tree growth features, responses to suboptimal site conditions, and reaction to fire.

40|$|There is {{worldwide}} {{interest in}} managing forests to improve biodiversity, enhance ecosystem services and assure long-term sustainability of forest resources. An increasingly important goal of forest management {{is to increase}} stand diversity and improve wildlife and aquatic habitat.

We briefly describe the <b>silvics</b> of Sitka spruce, western hemlock and red alder plantations as pure conifer stands or pure broadleaf stands. Then, we synthesize studies of mixed red alder-Sitka spruce/western hemlock stands in southeast Alaska and present their potential for improving stand structural complexity, biodiversity and other ecosystem services over pure conifer forests.

40|$|Natural forest {{management}} in the Solomon Islands is at an important stage of development. Undisturbed forest below the altitudinal limit for logging has mostly been logged at least once, and the remaining unlogged area is under concession. It is therefore inevitable that the focus of {{forest management}} will shift from exploitation of pristine forest to management of the large area of logged forest {{over the next few}} years. However, the research on which management prescriptions for Solomon Islands forests would be based has only just started, and there is an urgent need for the kind of information required to design appropriate management systems. This Manual collates the published and unpublished information currently available on the silvicultural behaviour and wood properties of the 12 most common timber tree species in Solomon Islands natural forests. Most of the <b>silvics</b> information has been obtained from a recent analysis of data obtained during monitoring of populations of all trees of these species > 4. 9 cm diameter on permanent sample plots on Kolombangara, as part of the Kolombangara Ecological Survey (KES). The KES has been a research project of the Solomon Islands Forest Department since 1964 and the plots have been monitored 15 times over the 30 year interval. The total area of permanent sample plots was 13. 9 ha in the early phases of the project but has declined over time as plots have been lost to cyclone damage and logging, although nine plots (5. 7 ha) have been monitored over the full 30 years of the study. The <b>silvics</b> data presented include accounts of species distribution and the ecology and demography of seedlings drawn from previous phases of the KES. The Manual also presents updates of tree growth and mortality rates under natural forest conditions, new data on changes in median and maximum crown exposure with tree size, and population responses to cyclones. Sections on plantation experience and wood properties are included, drawn from other published sources. Thus this Manual brings together in one place a summary of the accumulated knowledge on the twelve species described, which are the main timber-producing species of the Western Solomons. It is hoped that a single reference source will be of value for planning natural forest management. Fuller details on methodology and analysis are not given here but {{can be found in the}} source documents on which this Manual is based. </p...|$|E
30|$|Because drought-induced {{mortality}} {{events have}} been relatively infrequent in Northeastern U.S. forests (Allen et al. 2010), criteria including site or growing conditions, physiological responses, and plant traits have typically been used in classifying species’ drought tolerance. Otherwise, drought classification would be solely based on mortality and severity of dieback. Classification of drought tolerance often relies heavily on the geographic range of species distribution (especially in relation to soil moisture availability) {{as an indicator of}} a particular species’ capacity to survive moisture stress. These classification systems are developed using published sources of species’ range and environmental conditions to infer drought tolerance, including the <b>Silvics</b> of North America, USDA Plants Database, USDA Tree Atlas, and US Forest Service Fire Effects Information System (Niinemets and Valladares 2006; Matthews et al. 2011; Gustafson and Sturtevant 2013; Peters et al. 2015). It is worth noting that Gustafson and Sturtevant (2013) and Niinemets and Valladares (2006) also incorporated US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) mortality data and published results of crown dieback (>[*] 50 % branch dieback) for a few species, respectively, to aid in species drought classification.|$|E
40|$|With {{the correct}} {{chemical}} refinement, essentially any tree species {{can be used}} to produce biofuel. However, those species with rapid growth poten-tial and the propensity to re-sprout prolifically once harvested have re-ceived more attention. These quali-ties could allow for both a favor-able investment return and quicker renewal of the woody resource (Figure 1). Hybrid poplar (Populus spe-cies, including Eastern cottonwood) and willow (Salix species) are two of the most promising trees and have received the most research attention. Others having good potential for biofuel production include Ameri-can sycamore (Platanus species), sweetgum (Liquidambar species) and loblolly pine (Pinus species). None of these five are overly common in Tennessee. Collectively, these species represent only 7 percent {{of the total number of}} live trees in the state. This is attributed mainly to their explicit high-moisture site requirements, con-ditions that are often poor or limiting throughout much of Tennessee. Following is a brief overview of the <b>silvics,</b> conditions that affect tree growth with particular reference to the environmental factors, of the five species mentioned above. The discus-sion of each includes: 1) site requirements, 2) reproduction potential, 3) growth and yield estimates, 4) principal pests and 5) geographic distribution within Tennessee...|$|E
40|$|Northern white-cedar (eastern white cedar; Thuja occidentalis L.) is an {{important}} tree species in the northeastern United States and adjacent Canada, occurring both in pure stands and as a minor species in mixed stands of hardwoods or other softwoods. Yet practitioners have little and often contradictory information about cedar ecology and silviculture. In response to this information need, a group of university and government researchers in the United States and Canada embarked on {{more than a decade}} of collaborative research; this guide is a compilation of the knowledge generated by that effort. It includes an overview of the commodity and non-commodity values of cedar, <b>silvics</b> of cedar and companion species, descriptions of the cedar resource in the northeastern United States, Quebec, and Ontario, and silvicultural guidelines based on previously published literature and new studies of cedar regeneration, growth, mortality, site relationships, and responses to treatment. With generally slow growth and little to no ingrowth on most inventory plots in the region, silvicultural prescriptions that explicitly address cedar are warranted.

30|$|A primary {{obstacle}} {{to the development of}} quantitative silvicultural guidelines for mixed-species management has been the fragmented nature of the currently available quantitative information about mixing effects and stand dynamics. Although the <b>silvics</b> of tree species are very well understood and stand dynamics have been retrospectively analyzed for many mixed-forest types (e.g., Oliver and Larson 1996), monocultures are typically the only forest types for which quantitative information on tree and stand growth dynamics is available. It may thus be tempting to broadly base management guidelines for mixed-species stands on extrapolations of models for monocultures (e.g., on yield tables or individual tree models). However, extrapolating results from these models relies on the assumptions that the individual species in mixed stands behave like they do in pure stands and that mixed stands behave like monocultures. While this would enable a simple projection of mensurational parameters (i.e., stand growth) and structure as a simple weighted mean of the parameters obtained in the respective pure stands, recent research has shown that stand dynamics and system responses in mixed stands seem to be far more complex and would be poorly captured with this approach (Pretzsch et al. 2017).|$|E
30|$|Cyclocarya paliurus (Batal) Iljinskaja, {{commonly}} called “sweet tea tree” {{because of the}} flavor of its leaves, is a sole species from Cyclocarya genus and is widely distributed in sub-tropical regions of China (Fang et al. 2006). Leaves of this plant are traditionally used in China as a medicine or nutraceutical tea (Birari and Bhutani 2007; Fang et al. 2011). Many {{studies have demonstrated that}} C. paliurus possesses a variety of bioactivities, including antihypertensive activity, hypoglycemic activity, enhancement of mental efficiency, anticancer, anti-HIV- 1, and antioxidant activity (Kurihara et al. 2003; Xie et al. 2010, 2013; Zhang et al. 2010). These beneficial effects have been partly attributed to its content of several chemical components, including proteins, polysaccharides, triterpenoids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins, phenolic compounds, and minerals (Xie et al. 2010, 2013; Li et al. 2011; Fang et al. 2011). Owing to its multiple beneficial effects on human health, a huge production of leaves is required for C. paliurus tea production and for medical use. However, most studies on C. paliurus were focused on extraction procedures and low molecular weight substances, such as triterpenoids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins, and other compounds present in this plant, whereas less attention was paid to the <b>silvics</b> of the species (Deng et al. 2012, 2015).|$|E
40|$|Interest {{in mixed}} red alder–conifer stands is {{increasing}} in the Pacific Northwest. This paper reviews the current {{knowledge about the}} ecology and dynamics of such mixtures, including the <b>silvics</b> and distribution of red alder and associated conifer species. Nitrogen fixation can be a major objective for growing red alder in mixed species stands since it improves site productivity and sustainability on low-nitrogen sites. Also, mixing red alder into conifer stands seems to improve conditions {{for a variety of}} mammal and bird species. Because of its N-fixing ability, red alder can actually improve the growth of associated conifers on low-nitrogen sites, but in other cases it may lead to reduced growth compared with pure conifer stands. Chambers ’ (1983) empirical yield tables for red alder predict red alder yields adequately in mixed stands with a red alder proportion of 50 % or greater. Factors that need to be considered when choosing an associated species include soil nitrogen levels and the flood and drought potential of the site. Stand density, as well as mixture proportions, are discussed. Spatial aspects of mixtures include single tree, row, and group mixtures. Temporal considerations such as underplanting in red alder stands, simultaneous plantings of both species, and delayed plantings of red alder are presented. Finally, technical aspects such as specific needs for site preparation, harvesting machinery, and separation of species at the landing conclude the paper...|$|E
30|$|The {{advantage}} of using established classification systems {{is that they}} provide general information for nearly all tree species of the USA. A limitation {{of this approach is}} its reliance on fundamental (and often untested) assumptions about the relationship between growing conditions and vulnerability to dieback or mortality during drought (Niinemets and Valladares 2006; Gustafson and Sturtevant 2013; Peters et al. 2015). The USDA Plants Database categorizes species’ drought tolerance (low, medium, high) based on field observations but not necessarily on measurements and experiments (USDA, NRCS 2017). The USDA Plants Database also does not indicate what the field observations are based on. The <b>Silvics</b> of North America provides general information about site and soil conditions (e.g., precipitation and soil texture) where species grow. However, this approach to drought tolerance classification lacks a mechanistic understanding of what determines species’ tolerance, as geographic distributions may be confounded by numerous other factors (e.g., successional change, land use, competitive interactions, and biotic agents). Another potential issue with this approach is that certain species like Tsuga canadensis tend to grow at moist sites such as ravines, swamp edges, and north-facing slopes (Burns and Honkala 1990), which can lead to the assumption that this species is drought-intolerant. However, it is unclear whether T. canadensis is less tolerant of drought than other co-occurring species at the same sites. While studies have made important progress in understanding tree mortality and drought (Gustafson and Sturtevant 2013), habitat suitability of Northeastern U.S. species (Matthews et al. 2011), and linkages between shade and drought-tolerance (Niinemets and Valladares 2006), simple drought classifications may not account for specific mechanisms or functional traits that maintain growth or survival during drought.|$|E
40|$|Pinyon-juniper {{woodlands}} {{and forests}} cover well over 100 {{million acres of}} the western US. The cover type has generally received little attention from professional foresters, but is highly important due to its extent, its proximity to many communities, and its importance in providing wildlife habitat. The type is highly variable across its range {{with a variety of}} pinyon and/or juniper species, a variety of other tree and shrub species, a wide range of potential understory species, a diversity of age classes, and a wide range of geologic/soil substrates. Management objectives can vary widely and may include fuels modification, wildlife habitat improvement, improvement for livestock, forest and ecosystem health and sustainability, and landscape aesthetics. Nonsilvicultural methods have commonly been applied where management has been for the primary purpose of eliminating pinyon and juniper in favor of other vegetation types. Silvicultural methods are increasingly being applied to manage pinyon and juniper cover types for sustained tree cover as well as for other multipleuse goals. Both even and uneven-aged silvicultural methods can be used in pinyon-juniper ecosystems to manipulate stand density, structure, and composition to meet various resource objectives. No one prescription will fit all stands; and silvicultural prescriptions must be based upon current and predicted stand conditions, the <b>silvics</b> of the species on the site, and the ecological, economic, and social goals of the land owner/manager. This paper discusses various silvicultural and non-silvicultural methods that have been applied to the management of pinyon and juniper cover types. It presents a method of using Reineke’s Stand Density Index to determine residual stocking levels, which can be applied to even or uneven-aged stands...|$|E
30|$|Our fire {{behavior}} (proportion of live BA killed, crowning and torching indices, and flame length) and fuels (canopy bulk density and base height) {{results indicate that}} pre-out-break stands are highly vulnerable to stand-replacing fire under severe fire weather conditions, while outbreak stands also sustain substantial mortality, which increases through time. Spruce-fir ecosystems tend to experience a high-severity, low-frequency fire regime, regardless of insect presence, due to their dense stand structure and species’ <b>silvics</b> (Arno 1980, Agee 1993, Margolis et al. 2011). Spruce and fir species tend to have shallow roots, thin bark, low canopy base heights, and high canopy bulk density, resulting in high mortality from fire (Alexander 1987, Edmonds et al. 2000). In addition, fire return intervals for these ecosystems are long, often well over 100 years (Arno 1980, Agee 1993), which results in abundant ladder fuels, dense stands, and high surface fuel loading (Alexander 1987). Therefore, high-elevation spruce-fir stands {{that have not been}} recently logged or experienced fire tend to support fuel structures that are highly susceptible to stand-replacing, high-severity fire (Arno 1980, Alexander 1987, Agee 1993). Due to the persistent cool, wet conditions, severe fires in this ecosystem typically occur in the late summer and early fall during drought years when the snowpack is low and warm, dry conditions reduce fuel moisture content. In particular, these drought conditions occur in the Southwest when the El Niño Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation are in their cool phases (Margolis and Swetnam 2013). Our results show that there is a greater difference in fire severity between moderate and severe fire weather conditions than between outbreak and pre-outbreak conditions, regardless of time period. This coincides with the other research done in this ecosystem that has found the fire regime in spruce-fir forests to be climate driven (Agee and Smith 1984, Agee 1993, Kulakowski et al. 2003).|$|E
30|$|Our {{study focused}} on the stand scale, {{providing}} information at a scale important to forest managers needing to prioritize stands for management activities. However, modeling exercises {{such as the one}} conducted for this study are constrained by modeling limitations, and need to be contrasted with observations and fire behavior analysis on the ground. Fire behavior models, including FVS-FFE, have a tendency to under-predict some metrics used to predict fire behavior, such as crowning index (Cruz and Alexander 2010). Adjustments to the default parameters for fire weather (e.g., fuel moisture, wind speeds) and selecting fuel models can help alleviate (but not eliminate) model bias (Cruz and Alexander 2010). We used the nearest RAWS weather stations available, which were lower in elevation than our specific stands. Weather data that better represents stand conditions would likely reduce model bias. Specific to FVS-FFE, initial stand data and regeneration assumptions will influence stand structural characteristics, such as CBD and CBH, through time. Regeneration was periodically included using actual stand data; we believe that is realistic in this forest type, given the <b>silvics</b> of the species involved and lack of stand-replacing disturbance. However, as trees continue to succumb to WSBW and climate shifts, regeneration, both the abundance and species present, is likely to shift as well, which will affect fire behavior (Tinkham et al. 2016). The current WSBW outbreak has been ongoing for 10 to 20 years in northern New Mexico. In our model runs, we assumed that the outbreak ended in 2013 and included no additional growth reduction or mortality from WSBW. Removing this assumption, including a reduction in regeneration, would likely yield predictions of fire behavior that move farther away from those of pre-outbreak stands. Finally, additional research is needed to confirm our results, given our small sample size (n = 4 outbreak stands).|$|E
