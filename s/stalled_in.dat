5|$|Reagan also {{nominated}} Vaughn Walker, {{who would}} later be revealed to be the earliest known gay federal judge, to the United States District Court for the Central District of California.

5|$|After being <b>stalled</b> <b>in</b> the {{development}} phase {{for nearly a}} decade, the film's principal photography began in 2008 and lasted two years. The film marked the debut of Legacy Effects studio (which {{was responsible for the}} film's prosthetic make-up and animatronics) in Indian cinema. Enthiran was released worldwide on 1October2010, along with its dubbed versions: Robot in Hindi and Robo in Telugu. Produced by Kalanithi Maran, it was India's most expensive film up to that point.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008 {{legislative}} session, Roberts {{introduced a}} bill, drafted and lobbied for by Colorado students, {{to create a}} legislative youth advisory council.

5|$|His career <b>stalled</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s {{because he}} refused to swear {{allegiance}} to the Romanian Communist Party and was forced out of academia for his sympathies towards Israel. When Librescu requested permission to emigrate to Israel, the Academy of Science of Romania fired him. In 1976, a smuggled research manuscript that he had published in the Netherlands drew him international attention in the growing field of material dynamics.|$|E
5|$|While passing {{near the}} {{northeast}} coast of Florida, Kyle produced a storm surge of 1.31feet (0.4m) in Fernandina Beach. Winds were light, with gusts peaking at 32mph (52km/h) in St. Augustine, and precipitation reached 2.05inches (52mm) in Fernandina Beach. Along the Georgia coastline, the storm dropped moderate rainfall that peaked at 5.35inches (136mm) at Hunter Army Airfield. Most of the precipitation {{fell in a}} 12‑hour period, which flooded roads and low-lying areas; several roads were closed, and numerous vehicles <b>stalled</b> <b>in</b> the floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, the PSC {{largely ignored}} the lease plan {{since it was}} still focused on {{building}} {{the first phase of}} the Dual Contracts. The Flushing Business Men's Association kept advocating for the Amity Street subway, causing a schism between them and the rest of the groups that supported the LIRR lease. Through the summer of 1915, the PSC and the LIRR negotiated the planned lease to $125,000 a first year, , with an eight percent increase each year; the negotiations then <b>stalled</b> <b>in</b> 1916. The Whitestone Improvement Association, impatient with the pace of negotiations, approved of the subway under Amity Street even though it would not serve them directly. The PSC's chief engineer wrote in a report that a combined 20,600 riders would use the Whitestone and Bayside lines each day in either direction, and that by 1927, there would be 34,000 riders per day per direction. The Third Ward Rapid Transit Association wrote a report showing how much they had petitioned for Flushing subway extensions to that point, compared to how little progress they had made in doing so. Negotiations continued to be <b>stalled</b> <b>in</b> 1917. Despite the line not having been extended past Corona yet, the idea of a subway extension to Little Neck encouraged development there.|$|E

5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} {{reported}} throughout the state. About one-seventh {{of the cotton}} crop was destroyed by Octave. Much of the rich topsoil crop was washed downstream into large reservoirs. Furthermore, agriculture damage totaled about $97.5 million. Damage to homes totaled $17 million while damages to business exceeded $6 million in damage. Public property damage reached $55.7 million. A father, mother, and two children were swept off their truck in Ash Fork. Two navy officers where killed on September 30 near Ostman when their jet crashed. On October 1, a man drowned in the Santa Cruz river. Another person drowned in a wash near Tucson when his truck <b>stalled.</b> <b>In</b> addition, a taxi driver and a passenger died when tried to cross a flooded river.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, {{state and}} federal {{officials}} began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. Those talks <b>stalled</b> <b>in</b> October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the major}} MRT {{disruption}} of 15 December 2011, one C151 train (trainset 067/068, T139 in the COI) was <b>stalled</b> <b>in</b> {{the tunnel and}} its backup battery failed. The passenger compartments in T139 experienced a blackout and loss of ventilation, leading to one passenger smashing a train door window to avoid suffocation. The battery failure led to criticism by the COI {{on the condition of}} the aging emergency batteries installed on all C151 trains. SMRT has since proposed an upgrading plan to address this issue.|$|E

5|$|Operationally, German forces {{achieved}} major {{victories and}} occupied {{some of the}} most important economic areas of the Soviet Union, mainly in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and inflicted, as well as sustained, heavy casualties. Despite these Axis successes, the German offensive <b>stalled</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of Moscow and subsequently the Soviet winter counteroffensive pushed German troops back. The Red Army absorbed the Wehrmacht's strongest blows and forced the unprepared Germans into a war of attrition. The Wehrmacht would never again mount a simultaneous offensive along the entire strategic Soviet–Axis front. The failure of the operation drove Hitler to demand further operations of increasingly limited scope inside the Soviet Union, such as Case Blue in 1942 and Operation Citadel in 1943 — all of which eventually failed.|$|E
5|$|Texans were {{hesitant}} {{to pursue a}} US-Texas treaty without a written commitment of military defense from America, since a full-scale military attack by Mexico seemed likely when the negotiations became public. If ratification of the annexation measure <b>stalled</b> <b>in</b> the US Senate, Texas could face a war alone against Mexico. Because only Congress could declare war, the Tyler administration lacked the constitutional authority to commit the US to support of Texas. But when Secretary Upshur provided a verbal assurance of military defense, President Houston, responding to urgent calls for annexation from the Texas Congress of December 1843, authorized the reopening of annexation negotiations.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} not {{originally}} proposed {{as part of}} the Program for Action in 1968, but a later revision to that plan entailed building a Second Avenue Subway with one of its stops located at 72nd Street. Construction on that project started in 1972, but <b>stalled</b> <b>in</b> 1975 due to lack of funding. In 2007, a separate measure authorized a first phase of the Second Avenue Line to be built between 65th and 105th Streets, with stations at 72nd, 86th, and 96th Streets. The station opened on January 1, 2017, with provisions to extend the line south to Houston Street in Phase 3. Since opening, the presence of the Second Avenue Subway's three Phase 1 stations has improved real estate prices along the corridor.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Fifteen in 1970 was the wettest known {{tropical}} cyclone {{to affect the}} United States territory of Puerto Rico. The long-lived depression formed on September24 just off {{the west coast of}} Africa, and for several days maintained a general westward track. It passed through the Lesser Antilles on October1, and later <b>stalled</b> <b>in</b> the eastern Caribbean Sea. On October8, the depression crossed over the Dominican Republic, and subsequently it accelerated to the northeast. It was declassified as a {{tropical cyclone}} on October12, although its remnants persisted for another week before dissipating in the westerlies near the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Universal Studios {{acquired}} the adaptation rights from Millar in 2004, {{and while the}} eventual script drifted from the comic book supervillain mythos in the original miniseries, Millar was content to see most of the comic's darker content was retained. Production began in April 2007, with filming in the Czech Republic, Budapest, and the story's main setting, Chicago. Wanted was released in June 2008 to both critical and commercial success, with box office earnings of $341 million worldwide and reviews praising the fast pacing and stylized action scenes. A sequel was planned {{the same year as}} the film's release, but ultimately <b>stalled</b> <b>in</b> the development phase.|$|E
