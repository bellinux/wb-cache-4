5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer solstice, when the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, when the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the equinoxes, when the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> a G-type main-sequence star. It {{contains}} almost 99.9percent of all {{the mass}} in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> a G2V star, with G2 {{indicating}} {{its surface}} temperature of approximately 5,778K (5,505°C, 9,941°F), and V that it, like most stars, is a main-sequence star. The average luminance of the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> about 1.88gigacandela per square metre, but as viewed through Earth's atmosphere, this is lowered to about 1.44Gcd/m2. However, the luminance is not constant across the disk of the Sun (limb darkening).|$|E
50|$|In March 1998, <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> {{appointed}} Minister of Culture of the People'e Republic of China. In November 2006, <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> {{elected the}} Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. In March 2008, <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> elected 11th {{vice chairman of}} the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> {{also the}} sect ruler—or the {{luminary}} of sect for all charts {{of events and}} individuals born in the daytime, when the <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> over the horizon; and the Moon was the sect ruler or luminary of sect for night charts, when the <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> below the horizon.|$|R
50|$|The 1982 - 83 Phoenix <b>Suns</b> season <b>was</b> the 15th {{season for}} the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association. The <b>Suns</b> <b>were</b> in {{the playoffs for the}} sixth {{consecutive}} season, extending a then-franchise record. The <b>Suns</b> <b>were</b> eliminated in the first round two games to one by the Denver Nuggets, a team they had beaten by the same margin a year earlier. The <b>Suns</b> <b>were</b> led by head coach John MacLeod and played all home games in Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum.|$|R
5|$|The Sun's {{color is}} white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), {{when viewed from}} space or when the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> high in the sky. When {{measuring}} all the photons emitted, the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. When the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; {{the reasons for this}} are the subject of debate.|$|E
5|$|The heliosphere, the tenuous {{outermost}} {{atmosphere of}} the <b>Sun,</b> <b>is</b> filled with the solar wind plasma. This outermost layer of the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> defined to begin at the distance where {{the flow of the}} solar wind becomes superalfvénic—that is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of Alfvén waves, at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU).|$|E
5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> obscured.|$|E
25|$|In summary, Birkat Hachama is recited {{when the}} halachic vernal equinox (the {{position}} {{at which the}} <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> created) occurs at sundown on a Tuesday (the time at which the <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> created).|$|R
50|$|Aubrey Suwito's {{debut album}} Malacca <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> {{recently}} repackaged as One Busy Street. Malacca <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> originally released in 2000 {{but as the}} original recording house closed down, the album is now a rare find.|$|R
60|$|The <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> coming. There was a quivering, a {{powerful}} terrifying swim of molten light. Then the molten source itself surged forth, revealing itself. The <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> in the sky, too powerful to look at.|$|R
5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|During a total solar eclipse, {{when the}} disk of the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> covered {{by that of}} the Moon, parts of the Sun's {{surrounding}} atmosphere can be seen. It is composed of four distinct parts: the chromosphere, the transition region, the corona and the heliosphere.|$|E
5|$|Elemental abundances in the {{photosphere}} {{are well}} known from spectroscopic studies, but {{the composition of the}} interior of the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> more poorly understood. A solar wind sample return mission, Genesis, was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material.|$|E
50|$|Around the <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> a {{commercial}} and critical failure, and band members later expressed disappointment in the album after the tour ended. A majority of material from Around the <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> largely absent in their subsequent tour.|$|R
50|$|In February 2017, Ming Pao {{reported}} that <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> {{investigated by the}} Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. The CCDI confirmed that <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> investigated on March 2, 2017. He was expelled from the Communist Party on June 2, 2017.|$|R
50|$|In September 2011, Discovery Cruise Lines ceased operations, citing high {{operating}} costs {{and lack of}} profitability. The MV Discovery <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> subsequently offered for sale, {{but there was no}} buyer or charterer. Discovery <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> broken up for scrap.|$|R
5|$|Kepler's laws of {{planetary}} motion describe {{the orbits of}} objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. Objects closer to the Sun (with smaller semi-major axes) travel more quickly {{because they are more}} affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> called its aphelion. The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using numerical models.|$|E
5|$|Mars's average {{distance}} from the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> roughly , and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. The solar day (or sol) on Mars is only slightly longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds. A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth years, or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours.|$|E
5|$|The Lion and <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> an officially {{recognized}} but currently unused {{emblem of}} the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.

5|$|The Moon {{is visible}} {{for two weeks}} every 27.3 days at the North and South Pole. The Moon's light is used by {{zooplankton}} in the Arctic when the <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> below the horizon for months on end.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> a G-type {{main-sequence star}} that {{comprises}} about 99.86% {{of the mass}} of the Solar System. The Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4.83, estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|The energy {{generation}} of the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> based upon thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature {{at the core of}} the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the net {{energy generation}} that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E
50|$|The {{published}} Silmarillion {{states that}} the <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> created by the Vala Aulë; he and his people made a vessel to hold the radiance of the last fruit of Laurelin. The vessel of the <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> guided by Arien, a Maia.|$|R
5|$|The Phoenix <b>Suns</b> <b>are</b> an American {{professional}} basketball team based in Phoenix, Arizona. They {{are members of}} the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Founded in , the <b>Suns</b> <b>are</b> chronologically the second-oldest team in the Western Conference. The <b>Suns</b> <b>are</b> also chronologically the third-oldest team in the NBA to have never won an NBA Championship while having played in the NBA Finals at least once. The Suns play their home games at the US Airways Center.|$|R

5|$|The exact instants of {{equinoxes}} or solstices are {{the times}} when the apparent ecliptic longitude (including the effects of aberration and nutation) of the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°. Because of perturbations of Earth's orbit and peculiarities of the calendar, the dates of these are not fixed.|$|E
5|$|The seal of the University of Santo Tomas is {{a shield}} {{quartered}} by the Dominican Cross. Superimposed {{on the cross}} is the sun of Saint Thomas Aquinas, patron of Catholic schools, after whom the university is named. The <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> actually made similar to the Sun of May.|$|E
5|$|The visible {{outer surface}} of the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> called the photosphere. Above this layer is a thin region known as the chromosphere. This is {{surrounded}} by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures, and finally by the super-heated corona.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> a New York {{newspaper}} {{that was published}} from 1833 until 1950.
