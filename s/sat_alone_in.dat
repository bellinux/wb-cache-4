25|$|Manoah {{was told}} by his wife what happened, and Manoah entreated God to let the man of God come again and teach them what to do. God heeded Manoah and sent the angel to the woman as she <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the field. Manoah's wife ran and told Manoah, and he {{followed}} her to the angel, and asked him whether {{he was the one}} who had spoken to his wife, and he said that he was. Manoah asked the angel how they should raise the child, and the angel told him that they should do what he had told Manoah's wife: She was not to eat any product of the grapevine, drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing.|$|E
2500|$|The Provisional IRA {{also carried}} out attacks in other {{countries}} such as West Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, where British soldiers were based. Between 1979 and 1990, eight unarmed soldiers and six civilians died in these attacks, including the British Ambassador to the Netherlands Sir Richard Sykes and his valet, Karel Straub. On one occasion, the IRA shot dead two Australian tourists in the Netherlands, claiming its members mistook them for off-duty British soldiers. On another occasion an IRA gunman shot dead Heidi Hazell, a German woman, as she <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> her car. She was parked near a British Army married quarter in Unna. They claimed she had been shot [...] "in the belief {{that she was a}} member of the British Army garrison at Dortmund". Her husband was a British Army staff sergeant. Hans Engelhard, West Germany's Justice Minister called it [...] "the insane act of a blind fanatic." ...|$|E
60|$|And off she flew, and Kay <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> {{the great}} hall trying to do his puzzle.|$|E
60|$|They {{entered the}} drawing-room, and Deyes {{made his way}} to a secluded corner, where Lady Peggy <b>sat</b> {{scribbling}} <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> a note-book.|$|R
60|$|She <b>sat</b> down <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> {{the parlor}} {{and drew a}} long breath of relief. Captain Wragge's {{calculations}} had not deceived him. The evidence of her own senses had at last conquered the housekeeper's incredulity, and had literally forced her into the opposite extreme of belief.|$|R
6000|$|But Black Tom Daly <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> gloomily <b>in</b> {{his room}} at Ahaseragh, where it suited him {{still to be}} present and look after the hounds, and told himself that the {{occupation}} of his life was gone. Who would {{want to buy a}} horse even, now that the chief object for horses was at an end? ...|$|R
60|$|Three {{days had}} passed. Cosway <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> his lodging--pale and worn: the shadow already {{of his former}} self.|$|E
6000|$|... "I’ve got a {{touch of}} the ’art again, lad," [...] said the elderly invalid, as they <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the {{forecastle}} one night at Seacole.|$|E
60|$|Late {{that night}} Amelius <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> his room, making notes for the lecture {{which he had}} now {{formally}} engaged himself to deliver in a week's time.|$|E
50|$|In Scotland, District Courts were {{introduced}} in 1975 as replacement for Burgh Police Courts; they dealt with the most minor crimes. They were run by the local authorities. Each court comprised one or more Justices of the Peace (lay magistrates) who <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> or <b>in</b> threes with a qualified legal assessor as convener or clerk of court.|$|R
50|$|Group {{polarization}} {{is similarly}} influential in legal contexts. A study that assessed whether Federal district court judges behaved differently when they <b>sat</b> <b>alone,</b> or <b>in</b> small groups, demonstrated that those judges who <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> took extreme action 35% of the time, whereas judges {{who sat in}} a group of three took extreme action 65% of the time. These results are noteworthy because they indicate that even trained, professional decision-makers are subject to the influences of group polarization.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>sat</b> down <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the inn parlor, and {{occupied}} the time, while his hostess {{had gone to}} fetch the half-bottle of wine that he ordered, in examining a dirty old card which he extricated from a mass of papers in his pocket-book, and which bore, written on it, these lines: ...|$|R
60|$|She was in {{the office}} all day, being as curtly exact as she could. But in the evening she <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> her flat and feared the city.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{grinding}} of brakes. The car {{came to a}} standstill below. A woman, who <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the back seat, raised her veil and looked upwards.|$|E
6000|$|Half an hour later, {{a servant}} {{in the castle}} of Battel handed the missive to the {{daughter}} of Leicester as she <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> her apartment. Opening it, she read: ...|$|E
60|$|One night--it was a {{night of}} full moon--I <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> with Umslopogaas <b>in</b> my hut, and we spoke of the matter of our plots; then, when we had {{finished}} that talk, we spoke of Nada the Lily.|$|R
6000|$|The {{child and}} the old man <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> [...] <b>In</b> the quiet, {{peaceful}} shade [...] Of the old green boughs, that had richly grown [...] In the deep, thick forest glade. [...] It was a soft and pleasant sound, [...] That rustling of the oak; [...] And the gentle breeze played lightly round, [...] As thus the fair boy spoke:-- ...|$|R
60|$|They always <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> {{together}} <b>in</b> the big pew, and Alma Spencer, who {{sat behind}} them, declared that they held each other's hands {{all through the}} service. This lasted until spring; then came a sensation and scandal, such as decorous Heatherton had not known since the time Isaac Allen got drunk at Centreville Fair and came home and kicked his wife.|$|R
60|$|On {{the day of}} the {{marriage}} Agnes Lockwood <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the little drawing-room of her London lodgings, burning the letters which had been written to her by Montbarry in the bygone time.|$|E
60|$|That {{evening after}} dinner, as Mr. Merrick <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the hotel lobby, the girls having gone {{to watch the}} Major bowl tenpins, Mr. Jones {{approached}} {{and sat down in}} the chair beside him.|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll {{be quite}} {{one of the}} best-looking and most {{interesting}} couples of the Season, won't they?" [...] he cried, by way of farewell. The door closed and Francesca Bassington <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> her drawing- room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Scrooge it was. I {{passed his}} office window; {{and as it}} was not shut up, {{and he had a}} candle inside, I could {{scarcely}} help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he <b>sat</b> <b>alone.</b> Quite <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the world, I do believe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, how kind of you," [...] said Flora to her father, {{when she}} {{afterwards}} <b>sat</b> with him <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> this boudoir, and looked round on everything with the deepest interest.|$|R
6000|$|Jude {{went on to}} the house, and in the afternoon, when {{everything}} was done, and the layers-out had finished their beer, and gone, he <b>sat</b> down <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the silent place. It was absolutely necessary to communicate with Sue, though two or three days earlier they had agreed to mutual severance. He wrote in the briefest terms: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He will go yet," [...] {{she murmured}} miserably to herself one afternoon, as she <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> Rainbow Valley, reading {{a letter from}} him, [...] "he will go yet--and if he does I just can't bear it." ...|$|E
60|$|For half an {{hour the}} silence of the grim forest was broken only by the {{ordinary}} sounds of the teeming life that but adds to its lowering loneliness. Kaviri and Mugambi <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the palisaded village, waiting.|$|E
60|$|All {{night long}} Gudruda {{sat in the}} bride's seat. There {{she sat in the}} silver summer midnight, looking on the slain who were strewn about the great hall. All night she <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the bride's seat thinking--ever thinking.|$|E
6000|$|It {{happened}} {{that as he}} sat that evening all <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> his counting- house, looking over the bill of fare for next day, and checking off the fat capons in fifties, and the turtle-soup by the hundred quarts, for his private amusement, - it {{happened that}} as he <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> occupied <b>in</b> these pleasant calculations, a strange man came in and {{asked him how he}} did, adding, 'If I am half as much changed as you, sir, you have no recollection of me, I am sure.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He <b>sat</b> down <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> {{the great}} hall; {{the silence of}} it fell heavier and heavier on his sinking spirits; {{the beauty of it}} exasperated him, like an insult from a purse-proud man. [...] "Curse the place!" [...] he said, {{snatching}} up his hat and stick. [...] "I like the bleakest hillside I ever slept on better than I like this house!" ...|$|R
60|$|For {{more than}} an hour Mrs. Cliff lay in the state of {{palpitation}} which pervaded her whole organization, waiting for Edna to call her. And at last she could wait no longer, and rushed into the salon where Edna <b>sat</b> <b>alone,</b> the letter <b>in</b> her hand.|$|R
60|$|When Loo {{died the}} stateliness and {{stiffness}} of James Auberly gave way, and the stern man, leaning his head upon the coffin, as he <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the darkened room, wept {{as if he}} had been a little child.|$|E
6000|$|Next evening, as Mrs. Sterling <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the twilight, a {{tall man}} in army blue entered quietly, stood {{watching}} the tranquil figure for a moment, then went and knelt down beside it, saying, with a most unsoldierly choke in the voice: ...|$|E
60|$|Walter went to {{the outer}} office and apprised Mr Carker the Junior of his errand, who {{accordingly}} came {{out from behind a}} partition where he <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> one corner, and returned with him to the room of Mr Carker the Manager.|$|E
60|$|Trevennack and {{his wife}} <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> that night <b>in</b> their bare rooms at Gunwalloe. Cleer had gone out to see some girls of her {{acquaintance}} who were lodging close by in a fisherman's house; and {{the husband and wife}} were left for a few hours by themselves together.|$|R
60|$|He soon took {{leave of}} her, {{and did so}} with no warmer {{expressions}} of regard on either side than have here been given. Then he crept back to his lodgings, and she <b>sat</b> weeping <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> her father's house. When {{he had come to}} her during her husband's lifetime at Dresden, or even when she had visited him at his prison, it had been better than this.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Pavilion of the Princes" [...] at Plombières, {{was renamed}} {{following}} the meeting on 21 July 1858 between Napoleon III and Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour, who secretly negotiated the “Plombières Agreement” as they <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> together <b>in</b> a small horse-drawn carriage slowly progressing {{round and round}} the town. This accord granted French aid {{to the cause of}} Piedmont-Sardinia against the Austrian Empire in return for the territories of Savoy and Nice, which thereafter became French.|$|R
