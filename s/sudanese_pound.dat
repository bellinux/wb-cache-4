25|$|Al-Bashir has {{achieved}} {{economic growth in}} Sudan. This was pushed further by the drilling and extraction of oil. However, economic growth has not been shared by all. Headline inflation in 2012 approached the threshold of chronic inflation (period average 36%), about 11 percentage points up from the budget projection of 2012 reflecting the combined effects of inflationary financing, the depreciation of the exchange rate, and the continued removal of subsidies, as well as high food and energy prices. This economic downturn prompted cost of living riots that erupted into Arab Spring-style anti-government demonstrations; also it aroused the discontent of the Sudanese Worker's Trade Union Federation (SWTUF), which threatened to hold nationwide strikes in support of higher wages. The continued deterioration {{in the value of}} the <b>Sudanese</b> <b>pound</b> (SDG) poses grave downside risks to already soaring inflation. This, coupled with the economic slowdown, presents serious challenges to the implementation of the approved Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to assess the performance of the gas turbines operating in the National Electricity Corporation (NEC) grid. Currently there are five units, divided into two stations of Khartoum North power station (three units) and Kuku power station (two units). Gas turbines within the grid are important for the stability of grid and for overcoming power Shortages, especially in the summer. The Assessment of gas turbines units was done in two ways:- 1. Calculation of the average cost of producing unit of energy (KWh) in the plants. 2. Calculation of the thermal efficiency of gas turbine units, according to local operation conditions. The study found that the average per unit of energy produced in plants is (0. 54) <b>Sudanese</b> <b>pounds,</b> which is considerably high compared to average selling price of kilowatt-hour which is (0, 237) <b>Sudanese</b> <b>pounds.</b> The study also found that thermal efficiency has been found that the average thermal efficiency of the units’ ranges between (15 % and 21 %) is less than the usual efficiency of gas turbine...|$|R
