25|$|The {{genealogy}} and Nativity of Jesus {{are described}} {{in two of the}} four canonical gospels: Matthew and Luke. While Luke traces the genealogy upwards towards Adam and God, Matthew traces it downwards towards Jesus. Both gospels state that Jesus was begotten not by Joseph, but by God. Both accounts trace Joseph back to King David and from there to Abraham. These lists are identical between Abraham and David (except for one), but they differ almost completely between David and Joseph. Matthew gives Jacob as Joseph’s father and Luke <b>says</b> <b>Joseph</b> was the son of Heli. Attempts at explaining the differences between the genealogies have varied in nature. Much of modern scholarship interprets them as literary inventions.|$|E

This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener." [...] This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the Government Television Network with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody. [...] Then he would let it rest and come back to it and see if it feels right. [...] Then he would start [...] "building around it", [...] like putting a car together - start with a frame and then start building things around it.

This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs. They laid his body in a new tomb, cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. The account is marked by a sense of urgency in doing this before the Sabbath during which rest would be observed and no work could occur.|$|E

Much of modern scholarship interprets them as literary inventions. The Luke and Matthew accounts of the birth of Jesus have a number of points in common; both have Jesus being born in Bethlehem, in Judea, to a virgin mother. In the Luke account Joseph and Mary travel from their home in Nazareth for the census to Bethlehem, where Jesus is born and laid in a manger. Angels proclaim him a savior for all people, and shepherds come to adore him; the family then returns to Nazareth. In Matthew, The Magi follow a star to Bethlehem, where the family are living, to bring gifts to Jesus, born the King of the Jews. King Herod massacres all males under two years old in Bethlehem in order to kill Jesus, but Jesus's family flees to Egypt and later settles in Nazareth. Over the centuries, biblical scholars have attempted to reconcile these contradictions, while modern scholarship mostly views them as legendary. Generally, they consider the issue of historicity as secondary, given that gospels were primarily written as theological documents rather than chronological timelines.|$|E
5000|$|Fennel soon {{adopted the}} {{pseudonym}} Joseph Israel, {{with the last}} name being a reflection of his spirituality and reach for the blessings intended for all people, tribes, and tongues, based on the teachings of Messiah Yeshua of Nazareth.

He also started the group Lions of Israel, who he performed with throughout the Midwest starting in 2002. This culminated in 2004, when Joseph and the band were invited to open for Ziggy Marley at a sold-out concert in Fayetteville. His well-received acoustic performance brought Joseph {{to the attention of}} Marley's bassist Chris Meredith, who brought Israel to Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, where he recorded his self-produced and financed debut solo album Gone Are the Days, released in 2005. While its lyrics are of headline-torn news reports and a call for spiritual awakening, the album's sound itself was influenced by session collaborators Earl [...] "Chinna" [...] Smith, Dean Fraser, and Uziah Thompson. In 2006, Joseph Israel was signed to New Door Records of Universal Music Group, and in 2007 Gone Are the Days peaked at number 11 on the Top Reggae album charts.
