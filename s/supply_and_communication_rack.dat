5000|$|Nymph {{patrolled the}} Mississippi River {{and its tributaries}} {{through the end of}} the Civil War, helping to {{maintain}} Union lines of <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|R
50|$|The campaign—which {{stretched}} into 1944—showed {{the effectiveness of}} a strategy which avoided major concentrations of enemy forces and instead aimed at severing the Japanese lines of <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|R
50|$|Then, {{based at}} Vicksburg, she {{continued}} supporting {{operations of the}} Mississippi Squadron maintaining Union lines of <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> along the inland waters of the Mississippi and its tributaries.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the capture}} of the area, the Army {{discovered}} a large network of tunnels connecting different villages and towns that contained large amounts of weapons, ammunition, medical <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> equipment.|$|R
50|$|A British landing {{party of}} unknown size soon {{captured}} and occupied the signal station {{and other areas}} around the land side of Fort St. Philip. This action effectively cut off the American land <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> lines.|$|R
25|$|Finnish sources {{state that}} {{partisan}} activity in East Karelia focused mainly on Finnish military <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> targets, but almost {{two thirds of}} the attacks on the Finnish side of the border targeted civilians, killing 200 and injuring 50, including children and the elderly.|$|R
50|$|ICT is {{a crucial}} tool in industrialization. In {{emerging}} information and knowledge societies, open access to academic research, online collaboration and optimization of ICT enable countries to provide infrastructures well-suited for knowledge-based societies such as power networks, transportation systems, water <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> networks.|$|R
50|$|After Sheridan's highly {{successful}} campaign concluded, the cavalry corps - {{along with the}} rest of his army - returned to join the Army of the Potomac. For the next several months, they resumed their slow but steady snipping off of Confederate <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> lines.|$|R
50|$|In June 1943, the Allies {{launched}} Operation Cartwheel, which defined their offensive {{strategy in}} the South Pacific. The operation was aimed at isolating the major Japanese forward base at Rabaul <b>and</b> cutting its <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> lines. This prepared the way for Nimitz's island-hopping campaign towards Japan.|$|R

50|$|It was {{constructed}} {{in the summer of}} 1758 as part of a string or forts located along the line of <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> westward from the British Army's forward base at the frontier settlement of Carlisle as General Forbes’ army pushed westward toward the French garrison at Fort Duquesne.|$|R
30|$|The {{water quality}} sensors {{are made up}} of four {{essential}} modules, namely sensor, micro-controller, power <b>supply,</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication.</b> The sensor module is used for measuring the desired parameter of water quality in the form of analog information, and converting the measured information into a digital form through an analog-to-digital converter (ADC).|$|R
50|$|The town of Sibut sits on {{the banks}} of the Kémo, a minor {{tributary}} of the Ubangi River about 150 km long. Formerly an important route of <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> between Fort de Possel on the Ubangi and the French settlements around Lake Chad, the river is now non-navigable even with small watercraft.|$|R
2500|$|In 1791 {{his opponents}} {{advanced}} on all fronts, {{with the main}} British force under Cornwallis taking Bangalore and threatening Srirangapatna. Tipu harassed the British <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> embarked on a [...] "scorched earth" [...] policy of denying local resources to the invaders. In this last effort he was successful, as the lack of provisions forced Cornwallis to withdraw to Bangalore rather than attempt a siege of Srirangapatna. Following the withdrawal, Tipu sent forces to Coimbatore, which they retook after a lengthy siege.|$|R
50|$|Antigonus was {{appointed}} governor of Greater Phrygia in 333 BC. He was {{primarily responsible for}} defending Alexander's lines of <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> during the latter's extended campaign against the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Following Alexander's victory at Issus, the Persian mercenary commander Memnon of Rhodes ordered a counter-attack into Asia Minor {{in an attempt to}} sever Alexander's lines of <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> communication; however, Antigonus defeated the Persian forces in three separate battles.|$|R
50|$|Thinking {{that this}} {{temporary}} Federal weakness afloat {{in the area}} was just such an opportunity, Commodore John K. Mitchell, CSN, removed some of the obstructions; and, {{on the evening of}} 23 January, led the Southern Navy's James River Squadron downstream and attempted to slip through the new gap in the cordon of hulks which separated them from the Union warships. The Davis Administration joined Mitchell in hoping that a Confederate naval victory on James would break General Grant's line of <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> lift his siege of the Confederate capital.|$|R
40|$|Active. 2017 National Electrical Safety Code (NESC(R)) : This Code covers basic {{provisions}} for safeguarding of persons from hazards {{arising from the}} installation, operation, or maintenance of (1) conductors and equipment in electric <b>supply</b> stations, <b>and</b> (2) overhead <b>and</b> underground electric <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> lines. It also includes work rules for the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> lines <b>and</b> equipment. The standard is applicable to the systems and equipment operated by utilities, or similar systems and equipment, of an industrial establishment or complex {{under the control of}} qualified persons. The 2017 NESC Handbook, Premier Edition, is an essential companion to the Code. This handbook includes text directly from Code which provides users an easy reference back to the code, ruling-by-ruling. It gives users insight into what lies behind the NESC's rules and how to apply them. The Handbook was developed for use at many levels in the electric <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> industries, including those involved in system design, construction, maintenance, inspection, standards development and worker training...|$|R
25|$|The Luftwaffe {{had been}} {{successful}} in neutralizing Polish air and sea power within first days of campaign, and with air superiority established the Luftwaffe was free to concentrate on attacking <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> links with devastating effect. The outdated Polish Army was denied what mobility it had left as traveling by road became perilous and the rail networks had been largely destroyed.|$|R
50|$|After {{the fall}} of that {{important}} port, the American squadron occupied other Mexican ports along the gulf coast. Alvarado and Tuxpan fell in April, and in June Frontera and Tabasco came into American hands ending the fighting on the Mexican east coast. Thereafter, Reefer and her sister ships settled down to blockade duty and maintained both water lines of <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> for the Army.|$|R
50|$|Braddock had led a small {{invasion}} force {{launched from}} western Maryland. His poorly defended lines of <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> were soon compromised. Forbes intended {{to launch a}} large invasion from eastern Pennsylvania by hacking a new pioneer wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains. His plan called for a string of forts and blockhouses to guard the supply road from hostile bands of Native Americans.|$|R
50|$|FS {{was to be}} a {{joint effort}} between the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Imperial Japanese Army. The primary goal of the FS {{operation}} was to, following the completion of MO, RY, and MI, cut the <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> lines between Australia and the United States, with the goal of reducing or eliminating Australia as a base to threaten Japan's perimeter defenses in the South Pacific.|$|R
50|$|Catulus resumed {{the siege}} of the two Sicilian ports of Lilybaeum (at the western tip of Sicily, now called Marsala) and Drepana, and by blockading the {{harbours}} cut the connection to Carthage. The intent was seemingly to cut Hamilcar Barca's <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> lines. For {{the rest of the}} year Catulus waited for the Carthaginian response. The senate granted him a proconsulship for 241 BC.|$|R
50|$|The {{corduroy}} road demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage and {{is important in}} demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places, being a representative example of a once common technique of road building which did not require specific engineering skills and was readily employed by local farmers and residents to overcome difficult conditions along <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> routes.|$|R
5000|$|During the Mexican-American War he {{was given}} his first command, the pilot {{schooner}} [...] in the Home Squadron. For {{the duration of the}} war, Glisson sailed the Gulf of Mexico off Mexico's east coast. At the end of naval fighting in June 1847, Reefer and her sister ships settled down to blockade duty and maintained both water lines of <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> for the Army.|$|R
5|$|Dawson {{remained}} relatively lawful, {{protected by the}} Canadian NWMP, which meant that gambling and prostitution were accepted while robbery and murder were kept low. By contrast, especially the port of Skagway under US jurisdiction in Southeast Alaska became infamous for its criminal underworld. The extreme climate and remoteness of the region in general meant that <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> {{with the outside world}} including news and mail were scarce.|$|R
50|$|The guerrillas {{exploited}} the mountainous {{nature of the}} province {{to cut off the}} Bourbon’s <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> lines with Spain as well as to inflict heavy losses on the invaders. The populations abandoned their villages inducing famine among the Spaniards, who launched two offensives towards Oporto: the first was defeated by the militia and peasants at the battle of Douro and the second was beaten off at the Mountains of Montalegre.|$|R
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of the tank, {{in a series of}} increasingly successful operations, pointed {{the way out of the}} deadlock of attrition warfare and trench warfare, but the war ended before the British plans to field thousands of tanks could be put into a large-scale offensive. Fuller had proposed Plan 1919 which would use tanks to break through the lines and then wreak havoc on the German lines of <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Distribution {{automation}} is {{an effective}} method to realize fault detection and localization. It is not suitable {{for use in the}} comprehensive promotion in the distribution network because of the high investment and maintenance requirements. It proposes the monitoring system design principle firstly. The distribution line monitoring system based on internet of things technology is practical and of high scalability. It solves the problems in detection of single phase grounding fault, the terminal power <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> network. This system records peak current when zero sequence voltage a communication terminal monitors is greater than a certain value. A variety of power supply by solar energy, lithium battery backup and terminal itself can provide the power <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> wireless <b>communication</b> power <b>supply.</b> The system is suitable and practical for application in the distribution line...|$|R
5|$|The French {{forces were}} now {{east of the}} Prussians, behind their lines. Theoretically the Prussians could have marched {{straight}} towards Paris unopposed, but this course was never seriously considered: the threat to their lines of <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> was too great to be ignored. The unfavorable situation was compounded by bad weather and an alarming increase in sickness among the troops. With few other options available, Brunswick turned back and prepared to do battle.|$|R
50|$|Alarmingly Quneitra {{had been}} recaptured by Vichy forces on 16 June. This {{threatened}} Lloyds rear. By 18 June, Quneitra was recaptured but the Vichy forces from Quneitra still posed {{a potential threat}} to Gentforces <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> lines. Nevertheless, {{it was decided that}} an early thrust to Damascus would force the Vichy commander to withdraw his forces to assist in its defence. Thus the threat to Gentforces rear was to be relieved.|$|R
50|$|The British Army, led by General William Howe, had {{captured}} New York City in 1776 and Philadelphia in 1777. Even after {{the capture of}} Forts Mifflin and Mercer, which had previously prevented the resupply of British-occupied Philadelphia by sea, the British relied heavily upon the overland route between New York City and Philadelphia for the movement of men, <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication.</b> British troops also regularly foraged for supplies in the countryside around the city.|$|R
50|$|An army's tooth-to-tail {{ratio is}} often {{inversely}} related to its technological capabilities and subsequently its overall power. While an army with a high tooth-to-tail ratio will have more personnel devoted to combat, these soldiers will lack the support provided by the tail. Such support includes the <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> infrastructure on which modern armies depend. An army with a higher tooth-to-tail ratio may have more combat troops, but each will be less effective.|$|R
50|$|In a {{preliminary}} assault on March 26, 1945, they laid down a rocket barrage at dawn on Kerama Retto, a small cluster of islands off the southwestern shore of Okinawa, to allow US Marines {{to land and}} secure the islands and the harbor for protection of the hospital, <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> ships, <b>and</b> floating drydocks. The early dawn assault surprised the Japanese; the marines took control {{with a minimum of}} casualties and established a haven for damaged ships.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of Wischau {{occurred}} on 25 November 1805, between the Russian and French armies. The conflict {{resulted in a}} minor Russian success. It followed the action at Hollabrun and Schöngrabern, and preceded the Battle of Austerlitz. The relatively easy Russian victory convinced the Third Coalition Allies that the French army {{would be easy to}} beat, having reached the end of their <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> lines, <b>and</b> having suffered several losses in previous weeks of fighting.|$|R
50|$|The {{death toll}} was 103. Several hundred people injured and {{approximately}} 50,000 houses were damaged. Over 2,000 villages {{were affected by}} the earthquake. Electricity, water <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> were also severely affected by the earthquake especially in the Chamoli town, Gopeshwar and Okhimath region of Rudraprayag district. According to Mike Wooldridge, correspondent for the BBC News, Chamoli suffered most damage and almost all the houses and shops built on slopes in {{the lower part of}} the town were destroyed.|$|R
