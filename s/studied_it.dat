5|$|C. b. macrorhynchus, {{given the}} name great-billed {{cockatoo}} by Mathews, is found across northern Australia. Although {{thought to be}} widespread and abundant, this subspecies has been little <b>studied.</b> <b>It</b> is also large and has a large beak, as its subspecific name implies. Females lack red colouration in their tails.|$|E

50|$|With {{regard to}} the {{relationship}} between OBs and managerial evaluations, Podsakoff and colleagues (2000) found, in a summary of empirical evidence, that OCBs uniquely accounted for 42.9% of the variance in managerial performance evaluations. Results from this study also indicated that altruism or helping was significantly related to performance evaluations in eight out of the ten <b>studies</b> <b>it</b> was included in; sportsmanship was significantly related to performance evaluations in five out of the eight <b>studies</b> <b>it</b> was included in; conscientiousness was significantly related to performance evaluations in all three of the <b>studies</b> <b>it</b> was included in; and civic virtue was significantly related to performance evaluations in six out of the eight <b>studies</b> <b>it</b> was included in.|$|R

5|$|After Iso died in 1881, Kanō began {{training}} in Kitō-ryū with Iikubo Tsunetoshi (Kōnen). Iikubo was expert in kata and throwing, and fond of randori. Kanō applied himself thoroughly to learning Kitō-ryū, believing Iikubo's throwing techniques {{in particular to}} be better than in the schools he had previously <b>studied.</b> <b>It</b> is Iikubo who issued Kanō's only verified jūjutsu rank and teaching credential, namely a certificate of Menkyo (not Menkyo kaiden) in Nihonden Kitō Jūdō, dated October 1883.|$|E
5|$|The larger French {{specimen}} (MNHN CNJ 79) {{was discovered}} by quarry owner Louis Ghirardi around 1971 in the Portlandian lithographic limestone of Canjuers near Nice in southeastern France. It dates to the lower Tithonian. Although Alain Bidar originally described the specimen as a separate species called Compsognathus corallestris, Ostrom, Jean-Guy Michard and others have since relabeled it as another example of Compsognathus longipes. Quimby identified the smaller German specimen as a juvenile of the same species. In 1983, the National Museum of Natural History in Paris acquired the French Compsognathus fossil; Michard thoroughly <b>studied</b> <b>it</b> there.|$|E
5|$|The African {{species is}} a partial migrant, but its {{movements}} are complex, seasonal and poorly <b>studied.</b> <b>It</b> is mainly a wet-season breeder, and many birds {{move away from}} the equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow them to breed elsewhere. Southward movement is mainly from November to April, the return north beginning when burning or drought reduces the grass cover again. This species is present throughout the year in some West African countries, and in equatorial regions, but even in those areas numbers vary seasonally due to local movements; internal north–south migration has been noted within countries including Nigeria, Senegal, The Gambia, Côte d'Ivoire and Cameroon. This crake has also wandered further afield. It is rare on Bioko Island (Equatorial Guinea), and there have been two records each for São Tomé and Tenerife, the Canary Islands birds being the first records for the Western Palaeartic.|$|E

5|$|The initial aim of {{treatment}} is {{to settle the}} symptoms of an acute attack. Repeated attacks can be prevented by medications that reduce serum uric acid levels. Tentative evidence supports the application of ice for 20 to 30 minutes {{several times a day}} to decrease pain. Options for acute treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and steroids. While steroids and NSAIDs work equally well, steroids may be safer. Options for prevention include allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Lowering uric acid levels can cure the disease. Treatment of associated health problems is also important. Lifestyle interventions have been poorly <b>studied.</b> <b>It</b> is unclear whether dietary supplements have an effect in people with gout.|$|E
