5|$|P. acnes also provokes skin {{inflammation}} {{by altering}} the fatty composition of oily sebum. Oxidation of the lipid <b>squalene</b> by P. acnes {{is of particular}} importance. <b>Squalene</b> oxidation activates NF-κB (a protein complex) and consequently increases IL-1α levels. Additionally, <b>squalene</b> oxidation leads to increased activity of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme responsible for conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene B4 (LTB4). LTB4 promotes skin inflammation by acting on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) protein. PPARα increases activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-κB, thereby leading to the recruitment of inflammatory T cells. The inflammatory properties of P. acnes can be further explained by the bacterium's ability to convert sebum triglycerides to pro-inflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of the enzyme lipase. These free fatty acids spur production of cathelicidin, HBD1, and HBD2, thus leading to further inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Sebum, {{secreted}} by the {{sebaceous gland}} in humans, is primarily composed of triglycerides (~41%), wax esters (~26%), <b>squalene</b> (~12%), and {{free fatty acids}} (~16%). The composition of sebum varies across species. Wax esters and <b>squalene</b> are unique to sebum and not produced as final products {{anywhere else in the}} body. Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is unique to humans, and is implicated in the development of acne. Sebum is odorless, but its breakdown by bacteria can produce strong odors.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experimental}} treatments {{have shown}} promise in animal models. These include inhibitors of oxidosqualene cyclase and <b>squalene</b> synthase, cysteine protease inhibitors, dermaseptins collected from frogs in the genus Phyllomedusa (P. oreades and P. distincta), the sesquiterpene lactone dehydroleucodine (DhL), which affects {{the growth of}} cultured epimastigote-phase Trypanosoma cruzi, inhibitors of purine uptake, and inhibitors of enzymes involved in trypanothione metabolism. Hopefully, new drug targets may be revealed following the sequencing of the T. cruzi genome.|$|E
5|$|Living almost {{exclusively}} in the aphotic zone where little to no sunlight penetrates, the Portuguese dogfish is relatively common and the dominant shark species in deeper waters. The large, squalene-rich liver of this shark allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy and hover with minimal effort; males contain more <b>squalene</b> in their livers than females. A tracking study in the Porcupine Seabight {{has found that the}} Portuguese dogfish has an average swimming speed of , and does not remain in any particular area for long. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks. Known parasites of this species include monogeneans in the genus Erpocotyle, and the tapeworms Sphyriocephalus viridis, S. richardi, and Anthobothrium sp.|$|E
5|$|Terpenes and isoprenoids {{are a large}} {{class of}} lipids that include the {{carotenoids}} and form the largest class of plant natural products. These compounds are made by the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These precursors {{can be made in}} different ways. In animals and archaea, the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl-CoA, while in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates. One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis. Here, the isoprene units are joined together to make <b>squalene</b> and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol. Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol.|$|E

5|$|Relatively common {{where it}} occurs, kitefin sharks are usually solitary in nature but may form small groups. It {{is a slow}} swimmer with a large liver filled with <b>squalene,</b> a lipid less dense than water, {{allowing}} it to maintain neutral buoyancy and hover above the bottom with little effort. Studies {{off the coast of}} North Africa and in the Gulf of Genoa have found males outnumbering females by 2:1 and 5:1 respectively; this imbalanced sex ratio has not been observed off South Africa and may reflect sampling bias. The kitefin shark is preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks, as well as by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). Parasite data on this species is limited; an examination of two sharks caught off Ireland found three nematodes in the stomach lumen. One could be identified as Anisakis simplex L3, while another may have been a larval Raphidascaris.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese dogfish is {{too small}} and occurs too deep to pose a danger to humans. This species has long been commercially fished, using hook-and-line, gillnets, and trawls. It is mainly valued for its liver, which {{contains}} 2249% <b>squalene</b> by weight and is processed for vitamins. The meat may also be sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, or converted into fishmeal. An important fishery for the Portuguese dogfish exists in Suruga Bay for liver oil; catches peaked during World War II, but declined soon after from over-exploitation. In the past few years, catches by the South East Trawl Fishery off Australia have been increasing, as fishers have been seeking out species not covered by commercial quotas following the relaxation of seafood mercury regulations. Shark landings in this fishery are affected by a prohibition on landing livers without {{the rest of the}} carcass.|$|E
25|$|Oxidosqualene cyclase then cyclizes <b>squalene</b> to form {{lanosterol}}. Finally, lanosterol {{is converted}} to cholesterol through a 19-step process.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Corey {{commenced}} detailed {{studies on}} cationic polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of cholesterol from simpler plant terpenes. Corey established {{the details of}} the remarkable cylization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from <b>squalene.</b>|$|E
25|$|Polycyclization enzymes also rely on cation-π interactions. Since proton-triggered polycylizations of <b>squalene</b> proceed {{through a}} (potentially concerted) {{cationic}} cascade, cation-π interactions {{are ideal for}} stabilizing this dispersed positive charge. The crystal structure of squalene-hopene cyclase shows that the active site is lined with aromatic residues.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{basking shark}} {{has been a}} staple of {{fisheries}} because of its slow swimming speed, placid nature, and previously abundant numbers. Commercially, it was put to many uses: the flesh for food and fishmeal, the hide for leather, and its large liver (which has a high <b>squalene</b> content) for oil. It is currently fished mainly for its fins (for shark fin soup). Parts (such as cartilage) are also used in traditional Chinese medicine and as an aphrodisiac in Japan, further adding to demand.|$|E
25|$|The {{element is}} found in almost all biomolecules that are {{important}} to, or generated by, life. Only a few common complex biomolecules, such as <b>squalene</b> and the carotenes, contain no oxygen. Of the organic compounds with biological relevance, carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen (about 50%). All fats, fatty acids, amino acids, and proteins contain oxygen (due {{to the presence of}} carbonyl groups in these acids and their ester residues). Furthermore, seven of the amino acids which are incorporated into proteins, have oxygen incorporated into their side-chains, as well. Oxygen also occurs in phosphate (PO43) groups in the biologically important energy-carrying molecules ATP and ADP, in the backbone and the purines (except adenine) and pyrimidines of RNA and DNA, and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite.|$|E
25|$|An {{elevated}} {{concentration of}} plasma cholesterol, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, is now generally {{accepted as a}} major risk factor {{for the development of}} coronary heart disease. The objective is to decrease excess levels of cholesterol to an amount consistent with maintenance of normal body function. Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the isoprenes that are building-blocks of <b>squalene,</b> the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to lanosterol (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to cholesterol. A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of cholesterol resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and cholesterol. A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is {{at the level of the}} microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years.|$|E
500|$|Sebaceous glands secrete the oily, waxy {{substance}} called sebum (...) {{that is made}} of triglycerides, [...] wax esters, <b>squalene,</b> and metabolites of fat-producing cells. Sebum waterproofs and lubricates {{the skin}} and hair of mammals. Sebaceous secretions in conjunction with apocrine glands also play an important thermoregulatory role. In hot conditions, the secretions emulsify the sweat produced by the eccrine glands and this produces a sheet of sweat that is not readily lost in drops of sweat. This is of importance in delaying dehydration. In colder conditions, the nature of sebum becomes more lipid and in coating the hair and skin, rain is effectively repelled.|$|E
500|$|Unlike bony fish, sharks do {{not have}} {{gas-filled}} swim bladders for buoyancy. Instead, sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains <b>squalene,</b> and their cartilage, which is about half the normal density of bone. Their liver constitutes up to 30% of their total body mass. The liver's effectiveness is limited, so sharks employ dynamic lift to maintain depth while swimming. Sand tiger sharks store air in their stomachs, {{using it as a}} form of swim bladder. [...] Bottom-dwelling sharks, like the nurse shark, have negative buoyancy, allowing them to rest on the ocean floor.|$|E

2500|$|Philosopher Gary Steiner {{argues that}} it is not {{possible}} to be entirely vegan, because animal use and products are [...] "deeply and imperceptibly woven into the fabric of human society". Animal products in common use include albumen, allantoin, beeswax, blood, bone char, bone china, carmine, casein, castoreum, cochineal, elastin, emu oil, gelatin, honey, isinglass, keratin, lactic acid, lanolin, lard, rennet, retinol, shellac, <b>squalene,</b> tallow/sodium tallowate, whey and yellow grease. Some of these are chemical compounds that can be derived from animal products, plants, or petrochemicals. Allantoin, lactic acid, retinol and <b>squalene,</b> for example, can be vegan. These products and their origins are not always included in the list of ingredients.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Squalene</b> monooxygenase (also called <b>squalene</b> epoxidase) is {{an enzyme}} that uses NADPH and {{molecular}} oxygen to oxidize <b>squalene</b> to 2,3-oxidosqualene (<b>squalene</b> epoxide). <b>Squalene</b> epoxidase catalyzes the first oxygenation step in sterol biosynthesis and {{is thought to}} be one of the rate-limiting enzymes in this pathway. [...] In humans, <b>squalene</b> epoxidase is encoded by the SQLE gene.Squalene monooxygenase (SqMO) was formerly referred to as <b>squalene</b> epoxidase (SqE) in the literature.|$|E
50|$|Squalane is a {{saturated}} form of <b>squalene</b> {{in which}} the double bonds have been eliminated by hydrogenation. Squalane is less susceptible to oxidation than <b>squalene.</b> Squalane is thus more commonly used than <b>squalene</b> in personal care products, such as moisturizers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Squalene</b> is {{an ancient}} molecule. In plants, <b>squalene</b> is the {{precursor}} to stigmasterol. In certain fungi, it is the precursor to ergosterol. However, blue-green algae and some bacteria do not manufacture <b>squalene,</b> and must acquire it from the environment if they need it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Squalene</b> is the {{biochemical}} {{precursor to}} the whole family of steroids. Oxidation (via <b>squalene</b> monooxygenase) {{of one of the}} terminal double bonds of <b>squalene</b> yields 2,3-squalene oxide, which undergoes enzyme-catalyzed cyclization to afford lanosterol, which is then elaborated into cholesterol and other steroids.|$|E

50|$|Development of <b>squalene</b> synthase {{knockout}} mice {{has demonstrated}} that loss of <b>squalene</b> synthase is lethal, and that the enzyme is essential for development of the central nervous system.|$|E
50|$|Squalane is a {{hydrocarbon}} {{derived by}} hydrogenation of <b>squalene.</b> In contrast to <b>squalene,</b> {{due to the}} complete saturation of squalane, it {{is not subject to}} auto-oxidation. This fact, coupled with lower costs associated with squalane, make it desirable in cosmetic applications, where it is used as an emollient and moisturizer. The hydrogenation of <b>squalene</b> to produce squalane was first reported in 1916.|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} to link <b>squalene</b> to Gulf War Syndrome mainly {{due to the}} idea that <b>squalene</b> might have been present in an anthrax vaccine given to some military personnel during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Studies found that deployed Persian Gulf War Syndrome patients are significantly more likely to have antibodies to <b>squalene</b> (95 percent) than asymptomatic Gulf War veterans (0 percent; p<.001). The first of these published results concludes with the following statement: [...] "It {{is important to note that}} our laboratory-based investigations do not establish that <b>squalene</b> was added as adjuvant to any vaccine used in military or other personnel who served in the Persian Gulf War era." [...] The second publication, however, links the incidence of anti-squalene antibodies and Gulf War Syndrome to five specific lots of vaccine. Furthermore, they cite results of 1999 testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration which found these specific lots of vaccine to contain <b>squalene.</b> In response to these results, a committee of the US Institute of Medicine stated that [...] "The committee does not regard this study as providing evidence that the investigators have successfully measured antibodies to squalene", since the authors did not perform the normal scientific controls needed to show that their test was specific to anti-squalene antibodies. It has also been determined that the anthrax vaccines given to those US military personnel did not use <b>squalene</b> as an adjuvant. The vaccines were also tested for <b>squalene,</b> and none was detected with standard methods. Another method found no <b>squalene</b> in 37 of the 38 lots tested. One lot contained traces of <b>squalene,</b> at less than ten parts per billion, which is about one-thirtieth the level found in human blood. The FDA stated that this trace of <b>squalene</b> probably came from a fingerprint, since the oils on human skin contain enough <b>squalene</b> to send these extremely sensitive tests [...] "off the chart".|$|E
50|$|<b>Squalene</b> monooxygenase is a {{flavoprotein}} monooxygenase. Flavoprotein monooxygenase form flavin hydroperoxides at {{the enzyme}} active site, which then transfer the terminal oxygen atom of the hydroperoxide to the substrate. <b>Squalene</b> monooxygenase differs from other flavin monooxygenases {{in that the}} oxygen is inserted as an epoxide {{rather than as a}} hydroxyl group. <b>Squalene</b> monooxygenase contains a loosely bound FAD flavin and obtains electrons from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, rather than binding the nicotinamide cofactor NADPH directly.|$|E

[...] These rumours {{generally}} make unfounded claims that the vaccine is dangerous and they may also promote conspiracy theories. For example, Newsweek states that some chain e-mails make false claims about <b>squalene</b> (shark liver oil) in vaccines. The New York Times also notes that anti-vaccine groups have spread [...] "dire warnings" [...] about formulations of the vaccine that contain <b>squalene</b> as an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a substance that boosts the body's immune response, thereby stretching the supply of the vaccine and helping immunize elderly people with a weak immune system. <b>Squalene</b> is {{a normal part of}} the human body, made in the liver and circulating in the blood, and is also found in many foods, such as eggs and olive oil. None of the formulations of vaccine used in the US contain <b>squalene,</b> or any other adjuvant. However, some European and Canadian formulations do contain 25 μg of <b>squalene</b> per dose, which is roughly the amount found in a drop of olive oil. Some animal experiments have suggested that <b>squalene</b> might be linked to autoimmune disorders. although others suggest <b>squalene</b> might protect people against cancer.|$|E
