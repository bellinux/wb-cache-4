5|$|A CRA poll {{released}} in March 2010 showed {{public support for}} Williams' Progressive Conservative Party that had extended to a record 80 percent of decided voters, up from 77 percent from February. <b>Satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> the government was 93 percent voters. After controversies arose surrounding the accidental expropriation of the Grand Falls-Windsor paper mill and the province's readiness to react to a possible oil spill, the Williams led government {{as well as his}} personal popularity took a slight hit. A CRA poll conducted in May 2010, showed that <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> the government was at 87 percent down from 93 percent in March, the party's support had fallen five percent to 75 percent and Williams own support fell to 79 percent down from 81 percent. Even with the slight loss in support Williams remains by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country.|$|E

The main prediction that we test is that job <b>satisfaction</b> correlates <b>with</b> the wage gaps experienced in the past and present, holding other job-related <b>satisfactions</b> constant, <b>with</b> the possible exception of young workers. We further test that this effect of wage gaps on job <b>satisfaction</b> declines <b>with</b> working experience. We find evidence on a Canadian cross-section that the past matters...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the effects of utilitarian and hedonic values on young consumers’ satisfaction and behavioral intentions in fast-food and fast-casual restaurant sectors comparatively. Also this study investigates which value component (utilitarian or hedonic) is more effective on satisfaction and behavioral intentions. The results show that utilitarian and hedonic values have significant effects on satisfaction and behavioral intentions for both fast-food and fast-casual restaurant sectors. Additionally, satisfaction {{has an influence on}} behavioral intentions in fast-food restaurant sector, but does not have a significant effect in fast-casual restaurant sector. Moreover, associations between hedonic value <b>with</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and behavioral intentions are significantly different between fast-food and fast-casual restaurant sectors. On the other hand, associations between utilitarian value <b>with</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and behavioral intentions and association between <b>satisfactions</b> <b>with</b> behavioral intentions are not significantly different between fast-food and fast-casual restaurant sectors...|$|R

Rutherford attempted to quell the controversy by calling a royal commission, but pressure from many Liberals, including Bulyea, led him to resign May 26, 1910; he was replaced by Arthur Sifton, hitherto the province's chief judge. In November, the royal commission issued its report. It found that the evidence did not show {{a conflict of interest}} on Rutherford's part, but the majority report was nevertheless highly critical of the former Premier.

Academic advisor job satisfaction plays {{an essential part of}} this role in higher education. This dissertation study investigated the differences between ratings of job satisfaction among academic advisors employed at small, medium, and large institutions and the inter-relationships between job satisfaction, work environment, and demographic variables. The quantitative study explored job satisfaction based on archival data from earlier research on academic advisor job satisfaction. The study investigated four aspects of academic advisor job satisfaction: overall job <b>satisfaction,</b> <b>satisfaction</b> working <b>with</b> the supervisor, <b>satisfaction</b> working <b>with</b> students, and <b>satisfaction</b> working <b>with</b> coworkers among academic advisors employed at small, medium, and large institutions.
