This coincidence enabled Freemasons to wear the forget-me-not badge as a secret sign of membership.|$|E

25|$|As in {{some other}} species in the genus Elymnias, the common palmfly has a precostal cell in the hindwings and a tuft of androconial scales on the dorsal discal cell of the hindwings. Some populations of this {{butterfly}} species are sexually dimorphic: males and females do not look alike. In sexually dimorphic populations, males have black upperside forewings with <b>small</b> <b>blue</b> patches and mimic Euploea species, while the females mimic butterfly species of the genus Danaus.|$|E
25|$|John Herschel almost {{discovered}} Neptune {{the same}} way his father, William Herschel, had discovered Uranus in 1781, by chance observation. In an 1846 letter to Wilhelm Struve, John Herschel states that he observed Neptune during a sweep of the sky on July 14, 1830. Although his telescope was powerful enough to resolve Neptune into a <b>small</b> <b>blue</b> disk and show {{it to be a}} planet, he did not recognize it at the time and mistook it for a star.|$|E
25|$|Luigi - An Italian badger who {{travelled}} from Italy {{and stayed}} at Bodger and Badger's flat during Series 7 (the puppet design {{for this was}} very similar to Badger's). He had several arguments with Badger over which was the better food - spaghetti or mashed potato. At first Bodger {{did not know about}} Luigi's presence. After he found out about Luigi, Bodger allowed him to stay at the flat a while. Luigi only appeared in one episode. This meant use was made of the programme's requirement to have more than one Badger puppet at a time, should one get damaged in a stunt and be out of action for some time being repaired. A <b>small</b> <b>blue</b> trilby hat was wedged over the spare puppet's red beret and the clothes were changed (as all the Badger puppets were designed to be).|$|E

25|$|When {{the team}} changed their name from Kangwon Land to High1 the jerseys {{did not go}} through a {{redesign}} other than to update the logos. Both the home and away jerseys feature a red bottom on {{the main body of}} the sweater and red cuffs on the sleeves. The Home jersey has a black main body with white numbers surrounded by a red outline. The away jersey features black numbers with a red outline. Both jerseys feature a cursive High1 on both shoulders in their respective opposite colors. Sponsorship logos are featured on the right and left upper chest. The red cuff on the right sleeve features a small version of the mascot and the left sleeve features a <b>small</b> <b>blue</b> alien mascot. In 2009 the team added the High1 resort logo to the red section on the front of the jersey as well as the name in hangeul in the red section on the back of the jersey.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{national}} conventions are officially {{called to}} order by an opening ceremony {{in which the}} Eternal Flame of Service is brought forth {{by members of the}} Delta Omega chapter at the University of Houston. This tradition was started after the twenty-first national convention in Dallas, Texas. In the early hours of December 30, 1970, the delegates of the Delta Omega chapter met in a ceremony in the suite of H. Roe Bartle, with the newly elected members of the National Board of Directors and National President Aubrey B. Hamilton. Bartle lit a <b>small</b> <b>blue</b> candle that he in turn used to light a hurricane lamp, which was then passed from the blue candle to each of the board members' candles. He then joined the board members to light two four foot candles. The flame was then taken to Houston and allowed to burn while awaiting the completion of the Eternal Flame site.|$|E
25|$|Figure 3 {{shows the}} crystal {{structure}} of YAlB14 viewed along the x-axis. The large black spheres are Y atoms, the <b>small</b> <b>blue</b> spheres are Al atoms {{and the small}} green spheres are the bridging boron sites; B12 clusters are depicted as the green icosahedra. Boron framework of YAlB14 {{is one of the}} simplest among icosahedron-based borides – it consists of only one kind of icosahedra and one bridging boron site. The bridging boron site is tetrahedrally coordinated by four boron atoms. Those atoms are another boron atom in the counter bridge site and three equatorial boron atoms of one of three B12 icosahedra. Aluminium atoms are separated by 0.2911nm and are arranged in lines parallel to the x-axis, whereas yttrium atoms are separated by 0.3405nm. Both the Y atoms and B12 icosahedra form zigzags along the x-axis. The bridging boron atoms connect three equatorial boron atoms of three icosahedra and those icosahedra make up a network parallel to the (101) crystal plane (x-z plane in the figure). The bonding distance between the bridging boron and the equatorial boron atoms is 0.1755nm, which is typical for the strong covalent B-B bond (bond length 0.17–0.18nm); thus, the bridging boron atoms strengthen the individual network planes. On the other hand, the large distance between the boron atoms within the bridge (0.2041nm) suggests weaker interaction, and thus the bridging sites contribute little to the bonding between the network planes.|$|E
