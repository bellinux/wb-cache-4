Furthermore, in this paper, we analyze the impacts of pilots on <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexing</b> gain using the similar system model described in [27]. Since the number of pilots that can be assigned to the active users is limited, we will analyze the impacts of pilots on capacity-constrained FH.

As can be seen, the relative FH capacity mainly scales with the mean traffic density. In addition, the capacity in FH Segment II is always lower, as here the additional effect of <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexing</b> comes into effect. The difference between Segments I and II is more pronounced towards higher traffic densities. Here, clearly the <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexing</b> effect is more dominant compared to the reduction possible by accepting outage. Furthermore, {{it can be seen}} that higher values of traffic variance and correlation distance lead to lower FH capacities, as both parameters lead to a higher variability in total cell traffic among the different RUs, hence resulting in a higher multiplexing gain. Finally, it can be seen in Fig.  10 that a higher outage probability leads to an lower required FH capacity, as can be expected. Here, especially Segment I profits. In Segment II, due to the <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexing</b> effect, the probability distribution converges towards the mean traffic, and hence, the difference between the percentiles is less pronounced.|$|R
