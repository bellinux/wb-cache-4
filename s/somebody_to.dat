5|$|Because he {{reported}} late, Berg {{spent the first}} three months of the season on the bench. In August, a series of injuries to catchers Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy and Buck Crouse left the White Sox in need of <b>somebody</b> <b>to</b> play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher Ted Lyons refused to pitch to him. When Schalk asked him whom he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.|$|E
5|$|Simply disclaiming a {{beneficial}} interest does not fall within Section 53(1)(c), as in Re Paradise Motor Co. Nominating <b>somebody</b> <b>to</b> receive {{benefits of a}} pension fund should the pensioner die is also not a valid disposition, as in Re Danish Bacon Co Ltd Staff Pension Fund, and neither is nominating a beneficiary under a life insurance policy, as in Gold v Hill. Where a beneficiary declares he is holding the property on behalf of another, {{this would be the}} creation of a sub-trust and not subject to specific formalities. However, under Grainge v Wilberforce, such a sub-trust will only be held to be valid if there is some difference between the trust and sub-trust, and if the trustee-beneficiary has some duties to perform.|$|E

25|$|Rather, the bipedal {{adaptation}} hominines {{had already}} achieved {{was used in}} the savanna. The fossil evidence reveals that early bipedal hominins were still adapted to climbing trees at the time they were also walking upright. It is possible that Bipedalism evolved in the trees, and was later applied to the savanna as a vestigial trait. Humans and orangutans are both unique to a bipedal reactive adaptation when climbing on thin branches, in which they have increased hip and knee extension in relation to the diameter of the branch, which can increase an arboreal feeding range and can be attributed to a convergent evolution of bipedalism evolving in arboreal environments. Hominine fossils found in dry grassland environments led anthropologists to believe hominines lived, slept, walked upright, and died only in those environments because no hominine fossils were found in forested areas. However, fossilization is a rare occurrence—the conditions must be just right in order for an organism that dies to become fossilized for <b>somebody</b> <b>to</b> find later, which is also a rare occurrence. The fact that no hominine fossils were found in forests does not ultimately lead to the conclusion that no hominines ever died there. The convenience of the savanna-based theory caused this point to be overlooked for over a hundred years.|$|E
