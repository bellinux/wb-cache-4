5|$|The work, {{despite its}} attempt to depict Napoleon realistically, was criticised by several {{authorities}} {{for a variety of}} reasons.

5|$|Byzantine writers {{held the}} Slavs in low {{regard for the}} simple life they led and also for their {{supposedly}} limited combat abilities, but in fact they were already {{a threat to the}} Danubian boundaries of the Empire in the early 6th century, where they waged plundering expeditions. Procopius, the anonymous author of Strategicon, and Theophylact Simocatta wrote at some length {{on how to deal with}} the Slavs militarily, which suggests that they had become a formidable adversary. John of Ephesus actually goes as far as <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> the last quarter of the 6th century that the Slavs had learned to conduct war better than the Byzantine army. The Balkan Peninsula was indeed soon overrun by the Slavic invaders during the first half of the 7th century under Emperor Heraclius.|$|E
5|$|The California Fish and Game Commission {{was among}} the first non-Alaska {{conservation}} groups to oppose construction of the dam, <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> 1963 that it would inundate the Yukon Flats, an area of wetlands that is among North America's largest waterfowl breeding grounds. Following that objection, other groups began to organize during the 1963 North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference. Fifteen conservation groups pooled a total of $25,000 at the meeting to begin an independent scientific study of the project and start an opposition campaign.|$|E

25|$|Jews {{the world}} over welcomed The Forty Days of Musa Dagh and readily saw the {{parallels}} Werfel (himself Jewish) had drawn {{between them and the}} Armenians, especially the resentment and persecution both societies endured in the nineteenth century, when each benefited and suffered from governmental liberalization policies and the economic success that such policies engendered along with the Industrial Revolution.

Again in 1673, Banks successfully negotiated another contract for 700 tons of saltpetre at £37,000 between the king and the company. So urgent was the need to supply the armed forces in the United Kingdom, America and elsewhere that the authorities sometimes {{turned a blind eye}} on the untaxed sales.
