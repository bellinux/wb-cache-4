5|$|Race is a {{significant}} force in politics, and many political parties are ethnically based. Affirmative actions such as the New Economic Policy and the National Development Policy which superseded it, were implemented to advance the standing of the bumiputera, consisting of Malays and the indigenous tribes who are considered the original inhabitants of Malaysia, over non-bumiputera such as Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indians. These policies provide preferential treatment to bumiputera in employment, education, scholarships, business, and access to cheaper housing and assisted savings. However, it has generated greater interethnic resentment. There is ongoing debate over whether the laws and society of Malaysia <b>should</b> <b>reflect</b> secular or Islamic principles. Islamic criminal laws passed by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party {{with the support of}} UMNO state assemblymen in the state legislative assembly of Kelantan have been blocked by the federal government on the basis that criminal laws are the responsibility of the federal government.|$|E

The agricultural ones include Opitulus, Almus, Ruminus, Frugifer, Farreus, Pecunia, Dapalis, Epulo. Augustine gives an explanation of the ones he lists which <b>should</b> <b>reflect</b> Varro's: Opitulus because he brings opem (means, relief) to the needy, Almus because he nourishes everything, Ruminus because he nourishes the living beings by breastfeeding them, Pecunia because everything belongs to him.|$|E

25|$|After a {{decision}} process ends, leaders <b>should</b> <b>reflect</b> {{on the process}} and try to derive lessons learned regarding how to manage conflict constructively. Since reflections can lead to new insight, individuals must take time to critically assess the experience. They also must address and repair any hurt feelings and damaged relationships {{that may not have}} been apparent during the process itself. If these relationships are not repaired, trust could be lost which could negatively affect the effort of the next collaboration. Additionally, leaders should celebrate constructive conflict management and help others to remember the success of the process (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
25|$|After {{identifying}} the applicable threats, impact scenarios {{are considered to}} support {{the development of a}} business recovery plan. Business continuity testing plans may document scenarios for each identified threats and impact scenarios. More localized impact scenarios – for example loss of a specific floor in a building – may also be documented. The BC plans <b>should</b> <b>reflect</b> the requirements to recover the business in the widest possible damage. The risk assessment should cater to developing impact scenarios that are applicable to the business or the premises it operates. For example, it might not be logical to consider tsunami in the region of Mideast since the likelihood of such a threat is negligible.|$|E
25|$|The 1981 general {{elections}} saw the Nationalist Party (NP) gaining an absolute majority of votes, yet the Labour winning {{the majority of}} Parliamentary seats under the Single Transferable Vote and Mintoff remained Prime Minister, leading to a political crisis. The Nationalists, now led by Eddie Fenech Adami, {{refused to accept the}} electoral result and also refused to take their seats in parliament for {{the first years of the}} legislature, mounting a campaign demanding that Parliament <b>should</b> <b>reflect</b> the democratic will of the people. Despite this, the Labour government remained in power for the full five-year term. Mintoff resigned as Prime Minister and Party leader and appointed Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici as his successor in 1984.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea that}} {{language}} and thought are intertwined is ancient. Plato argued against sophist thinkers such as Gorgias of Leontini, who {{held that the}} physical world cannot be experienced except through language; this made the question of truth dependent on aesthetic preferences or functional consequences. Plato held instead that the world consisted of eternal ideas and that language <b>should</b> <b>reflect</b> these ideas as accurately as possible. Following Plato, St. Augustine, for example, held the view that language was merely labels applied to already existing concepts. This view remained prevalent throughout the Middle Ages. Roger Bacon held the opinion that language was but a veil covering up eternal truths, hiding them from human experience. For Immanuel Kant, language was but one of several tools used by humans to experience the world.|$|E
25|$|White is {{acceptable}} {{on the chest}} and toes. The presence of black guard hairs or ticking is not addressed in the AKC standard, although the elaboration of the AKC standard notes the amount of black or dark brown in the coat should not be excessive. The FCI standard states that excessive black hairs throughout the coat are highly undesirable. Ridgebacks sometimes have a dark mask. The dog's nose should be black or brown (liver) {{in keeping with the}} color of the dog. No other colored nose is permissible. The brown nose is a recessive gene. It is not as common as a black nose; some breeders believe the inclusion of brown noses in a breeding program is necessary for maintaining the vibrancy of the coat. The eyes should be round and <b>should</b> <b>reflect</b> the dog's color: dark eyes with a black nose, amber eyes with a brown (liver) nose. Ridgebacks have a strong, smooth tail, which is usually carried in a gentle curve backwards.|$|E
25|$|The museum’s {{articles}} of incorporation and bylaws were adopted {{in the fall of}} 1961, and a Board of Trustees was appointed. In their early discussions, Wilder and the board decided that the museum’s programs and permanent collection <b>should</b> <b>reflect</b> many aspects of American culture, both historic and contemporary. This decision paved the way for an expansion of the permanent collection that first focused on acquiring American art from the nineteenth-century and, later, the twentieth. Under Wilder’s guidance, the museum collected heavily in the areas of nineteenth-century American art and photography. Wilder also established an academic publishing presence and built a record of organizing groundbreaking exhibitions. The museum published Paper Talk: The Illustrated Letters of Charles M. Russell in 1962, the first of many books on the art of the American West to originate from the Amon Carter. In 1966, Wilder reintroduced the paintings of Georgia O’Keeffe (1887–1986) to the nation by organizing a ninety-five piece retrospective of her work.|$|E

25|$|Neptune, the {{farthest}} planet from Earth, {{has increased in}} brightness since 1980. Neptune's brightness is statistically correlated with its stratospheric temperature. Hammel and Lockwood hypothesize that the change in brightness includes a solar variation component {{as well as a}} seasonal component, though they did not find a statistically significant correlation with solar variation. They propose that the resolution of this issue will be clarified by brightness observations in the next few years: forcing by a change in sub-solar latitude <b>should</b> be <b>reflected</b> in a flattening and decline of brightness, while solar forcing <b>should</b> be <b>reflected</b> in a flattening and then resumed rise of brightness.|$|R
25|$|It was {{emphasised}} {{that information}} should quickly be communicated back to headquarters and that troops should independent within the plan, rather than needing to refer back for orders {{to achieve a}} high tempo of operations (the rate or rhythm of activity relative to the enemy). On 27 June, Haig agreed to widen the II Corps frontage to attack Tower Hamlets, a cluster of pillboxes {{at the top of}} the Bassevillebeek Spur opposite the right flank, which was an obvious base for a German counter-attack into the right flank of II Corps. Haig arranged through the Fifth Army HQ to take over the 24th Division and artillery from the Second Army, extending the southern flank of the II Corps to the Klein Zillebeke–Zandvoorde road on 4 July. After discussing the memorandum with Gough and Plumer on 28 June, Haig endorsed the Fifth Army plan but emphasised that the main battle would be for the Gheluvelt Plateau and the plan <b>should</b> <b>reflect</b> this. An advance in the north should depend on the capture and consolidation of the plateau, after which an advance along the main ridge to Broodseinde could begin.|$|E

The Singapore Changi Airport officially completes renovations at Terminal 2 {{after three years of}} upgrading. The IMF chief Rodrigo de Rato has criticised attempts made by the United States, People's Republic of China and some other nations to depress fuel prices, and advocated raising prices, instead of tax breaks or subsidies at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries seminar {{on the first day of}} the conference. He added that domestic pricing policies for refined fuel <b>should</b> <b>reflect</b> the scarcity of the resource, and high world crude oil prices. He acknowledged there would be some political resistance to raise the oil prices, but he mentioned successful experiences in Indonesia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. He called for adequate investment in the oil industry to ease concerns about oil supply in the later years, and appealed oil producing countries to balance the spending and savings for future generations. The IMF warned that the global markets faces a risk of a major setback, including an economic downturn in the United States, falling home prices, further surge in oil prices, interest rate rises to contain inflationary pressures, which the IMF said in its twice a year report on global financial stability.|$|E
25|$|That Start transit {{requires}} {{the attainment of}} a threshold cell size directly implies that yeast cells measure their own size, {{so that they can}} use that information to regulate Start. A favored model for how yeast cells, as well as cells of other species, measure their size relies on the detection of overall translation rate. Essentially, since cell growth consists, to a great extent, of the synthesis of ribosomes to produce more proteins, the overall rate of protein production <b>should</b> <b>reflect</b> cell size. Thus, a single protein that is produced at a constant rate relative to total protein production capacity will be produced in higher quantities as the cell grows. If this protein promotes cell cycle progression (Start in the case of yeast), then it will link cell cycle progression to translation rate and, therefore, cell size. Importantly, this protein must be unstable, so that its levels depend on its current translation rate, rather than the rate of translation over time. Furthermore, since the cell grows in volume as well as mass, the concentration of this size sensor will remain constant with growth, so its activity must be compared against something that does not change with cell growth. Genomic DNA was suggested as such a standard early on, because it is (by definition) present in a constant quantity until the start of DNA replication. How this occurs remains a major question in current studies of size control (see below).|$|E
5000|$|Many of Ankhefensekhmet's {{ancestors}} {{bore the}} title of [...] "Chief of master-craftsmen", more commonly referred as [...] "High Priest of Ptah". Robert K. Ritner suggested that the mention of pharaohs of the Hyksos period (Apepi, the otherwise unknown Sharek and Aaqen) <b>should</b> <b>reflects</b> {{the continuity of the}} sequence of ancestors, rather than an acceptance of the Hyksos rule by the indigenous people of Egypt; in fact, the name Aaqen, which means [...] "Valiant ass", looks like an intentional misspelling of [...] "Strong of valour". Still earlier, Alan Gardiner also suggested that Aaqen may be a mocking name for Aaqenenre ("Great and strong is Ra"), which is one of Apepi's throne names.|$|R
