40|$|The {{intrinsic}} charge {{transport of}} stanene is investigated by using density function theory and density function perturbation theory coupled with Boltzmann transport equations from first principles. The accurate Wannier interpolations {{are applied to}} calculate the charge carrier scatterings with all branches of phonons with dispersion contribution. The intrinsic carrier mobilities are predicted to be 2 3 × 10 ^ 3 cm^ 2 /(V s) at 300 K, and {{we find that the}} intervalley scatterings from the out-of-plane and transverse acoustic phonon modes dominate the carrier relaxation. In contrast, the intrinsic carrier mobilities obtained by the conventional deformation potential approach (Long et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 17728) are found to as large as 2 3 × 10 ^ 6 cm^ 2 /(V s) at 300 K, in which the longitudinal acoustic phonons are assumed to be the only scattering mechanism. The inadequacy of the deformation potential approximation in stanene is attributed to the buckling of the honeycomb structure, which originates from the sp^ 2 -sp^ 3 orbital hybridization and results in broken mirror symmetry as compared to graphene. The high carrier mobility of stanene renders it a promising candidate in nanoelectronics and spintronics applications and we propose to enhance its carrier mobilities by suppressing the out-of-plane vibrations by substrate <b>suspension</b> or <b>clamping.</b> Comment: Some Table is update...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel technological and design study of optical guided- wave MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) switch. We {{work on a}} concept of hermetic assembly in which a MEMS wafer is covered (top-down) by a crossing optical waveguide wafer. The mirrors {{are designed to be}} pulled up and inserted at waveguide intersection for N × N optical switching. Vertical micromirrors have been fabricated in SU 8 photopolymer or in single crystalline silicon (on SOI substrate). The SU 8 mirrors, coated with gold layer, exhibit vertical and smooth sidewalls that will be sufficient for optical use. For integration of silicon mirrors, we have developed a new simple two-step deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) pattern transfer that allow simultaneous fabrication of good quality silicon mirrors (20 μm height and 2 μm thickness) and of recessed mechanical platform (5 μm thick). The platform has been analysed through its resonance behaviour. The strong effect of mechanical non-linearity which is observed in <b>clamped</b> <b>suspension</b> can be exploited to increase the control range of the electrostatic actuator. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|O presente trabalho é de natureza {{experimental}} e, visa apresentar uma contribuição sobre o estudo da estimativa de vida útil de cabos condutores de energia elétrica, tendo como referência a análise da resistência à fadiga por fretting. Em particular, o levantamento de dados preliminares que possibilitem a determinação da curva de durabilidade (Curva de Wöhler ou S-N) da montagem do cabo CAA 397, 5 MCM - IBIS, com o grampo de suspensão monoarticulado, assim como, identificar as características associadas ao aspecto e posicionamento das falhas encontradas neste tipo de cabo. Testes a uma mesma amplitude de tensão foram conduzidos, observando-se a ruptura do primeiro, segundo e terceiro fio de alumínio e registrando-se o número de ciclos experimentado pela montagem até o instante de cada quebra. Repetindo-se o teste para diferentes amplitudes de deslocamento pode-se então traçar uma curva da amplitude de tensão contra o número de ciclos, a qual é denominada de Curva S-N ou de Wöhler. Para estabelecer a tensão gerada na região de falha utilizou-se a fórmula de Poffenberger-Swart (1965). Os ensaios foram executados, de acordo com as recomendações da CIGRE (1985), EPRI (1979) e IEEE (1978), em uma bancada de 46, 8 metros de comprimento, em ambiente climatizado, com sistema de controle dos equipamentos totalmente informatizado. Para a combinação cabogrampo usada, a Curva Limite de Segurança da CIGRÉ (CSBL) mostrou-se muito conservativa, isto é, a vida do cabo é de 5 a 10 vezes maior quando calculada utilizando a curva específica do material como referência. Através do mapeamento das falhas contatouse que para amplitudes de deslocamento menores que 1, 0 mm, de maneira geral as falhas ocorreram na camada externa, já para amplitudes maiores a maior incidência até três falhas, foi na camada interna. O valor médio das distâncias das falhas na camada externa foi de 26, 7 mm e na camada interna foi de 26, 2 mm. Esta constatação evidencia que a previsão da vida útil em fadiga do cabo é de grande importância para as atividades de manutenção, isto porque, as quebras dos fios ocorrem dentro do grampo de suspensão e, portanto não podem ser identificadas nas inspeções visuais. _______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe present wok {{consists of}} an experimental research on fretting fatigue of an ACSR IBIS overhead conductor, with the objective {{to contribute to the}} study of the estimated fatigue life of such components. More specifically, tests were conducted in the same bending displacement amplitude (peak to peak) at a position on the cable 89 mm away from the last point of contact between cable and the mono-articulated aluminium clamping system. The rupture of the first, second and third aluminum strands were monitored as well as the number of cycles experienced by the assembly until the moment of each break. Repeating the test for different levels of prescribed displacement amplitudes one can then plot a curve of stress amplitude versus fatigue life, the so called S-N or Wöhler`s Curve. To correlate the prescribed displacement with stress amplitude Poffenberger-Swart equation was used. The tests were performed in accordance with the recommendations of CIGRE (1985), EPRI (1979) and IEE (1978), in a 46. 8 meters long span, in air conditioned environment and using a closed loop control system to assure the repeatability of the tests. The results of the tests showed that, for the conductor/clamp mounting used, the CIGRE Safe Border Line (CSBL) curve was extremely conservative. The actual conductor life was 5 to 10 times higher than the value estimated by the CSBL for the same level of stress amplitude. Such result emphasizes the need to raise specific laboratory S-N curves for different cable/clamp assemblies should accuracy of life estimates be pursued. Mapping the wire failures it was found that for displacement amplitudes smaller than 1 mm, the failures generally occurred in the outer layer, while for amplitudes larger than 1 mm, they preferably occurred in the inner aluminium layer, for up to three failures. Such wire breaks were localized inside the clamp at average distances of 26. 7 mm in the outer layer and 26. 2 mm in the inner layer, both measured from the clamp mouth. The fact that the broken strand occurs well within the <b>suspension</b> <b>clamp</b> means that it can not be identified by visual inspection and that even inspections by infrared thermography may not be effective, demonstrating the need to establish an accurate methodology to estimate the remaining conductor life in order to allow maintenance before a cathastrofic breakage of the whole cable...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) optical {{switches}} for telecommunication applications. The {{aim is to}} study new type of microsystems for guided-wave optical switching applications. Two projects have been investigated. The first part addresses a novel technological and design study of N×N optical switch integration with planar waveguides and vertical displacement micro-mirrors. Novel suspended MEMS mechanical platform on SOI wafer were designed and realized and technological processes for optimization of micro-mirrors quality have been developed. The motivation {{of this study was}} related to initial collaboration with the company Memscap S. A. which was looking for compact and fast N×N optical switches based on planar waveguides. One of the key issue being waveguide integration, a concept of a hermetic packaging with two wafers assembly where a waveguide wafer is placed face down on top of MEMS electrostatic devices with vertical micro-mirrors has been developed. Vertical micro-mirrors have been fabricated in SU 8 photopolymer or in single crystalline silicon. For integration of silicon mirrors, a new simple two-steps DRIE pattern transfer that allow simultaneous fabrication of good quality silicon mirrors and of recessed mechanical platform has been demonstrated. The platform has been analysed through its resonance behaviour. The strong effect of mechanical non-linearity which was observed in <b>clamped</b> <b>suspension</b> can be exploited to increase the control range of the electrostatic actuator. During {{the first part of this}} work on MEMS optical switches based on planar waveguides, a totally new approach that use hollow waveguide instead of solid core waveguide has been developed. The primary motivation was whether it was possible to integrate a micromechanical switch composed of a vertical silicon cantilever beam mechanism inside the air core of the hollow waveguide. Silicon Planar Hollow Waveguides (PHW) have been designed, realized and tested with different optical coatings: a metallic gold coating, dielectric bilayers based on the principle of AntiResonant Reflective Optical Waveguide (ARROW) and bare silicon. The influence of ARROW layers on hollow planar waveguides has been investigated. The very first PHW with integrated 1 × 2 optical switching have been manufactured and characterized. Switching times better than 10 μs were measured with the produced devices. The switching speed was about 100 times higher to other MEMS optical switches based on micro-mirrors...|$|R
