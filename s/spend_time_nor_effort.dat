30|$|Missed Opportunities and Crew Idle Time {{are caused}} by {{stochastic}} and correlation effects that result in crew performance rates that {{are different from the}} deterministically derived optimum base plan. This base plan assumes that each activity progresses at its expected rate and the start times for each activity are set to ensure that crews neither <b>spend</b> <b>time</b> idle <b>nor</b> miss any opportunities for starting and finishing work sooner. Crew Idle Time represents an additional direct cost to the project in that the crews are employed {{for longer periods of time}} to complete the specified amount of work. Missed Opportunities represent an indirect cost to the project in that they lead to a longer than necessary project duration and therefore result in unnecessary project overhead costs.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This paper reports on an eye-movement study of {{undergraduate}} mathematical reading behaviours. The eye movements of 38 undergraduate students were recorded as they read a multi-page textbook section on graph theory; participants {{then took a}} short comprehension test. This abstract reports basic results showing that neither reading <b>time</b> <b>nor</b> processing <b>effort</b> – measured via mean fixation durations – predicted comprehension test performance: students who read for longer or tried harder did not necessarily learn more. The conference report will include more detailed analysis of participants’ eye movements: it will explore their relative attention to {{different parts of the}} text {{and the extent to which}} they shift their attention back and forth during learning, and will analyse the extent to which these behaviours differ across more and less effective learners...|$|R

Due to his size, Forrest is cast as Goliath in a daily reenactment of the famous fight, but he finds the work harmful as he is constantly hit with rocks from the guy who plays David, and [...] "keeps muttering about Jodie Foster." [...] Finally deciding he has had enough, Forrest one day takes matters into his own hand; throwing his rival across the arena. In doing so, he accidentally causes the park's circuitry to go haywire, resulting in mayhem and the reverend to be exposed having an affair with his secretary. Forrest is skirted away by a man, whom Forrest thinks is [...] "Mr. Bozoski", and put in a nice section of New York City. Forrest's new boss say he has been studying him for some time and wants him to push papers on Wall Street. Forrest is suspicious of making $250,000 a year just to sign papers, but figures he can take care of Little Forrest. While at one restaurant frequented by celebrities, Forrest and his son are talked up by one young celebrity filming Big who makes remarks such as [...] "life is a box of chocolates" [...] or [...] "stupid is as stupid does", which both Forrest Sr. and Forrest Jr. consider strange. Forrest is also given an attractive brunette secretary. Forrest fails to see the intended reason for his secretary, at first treating her as an employee, but eventually gives in to her advances when she plays herself as lonely. One night after lovemaking with his secretary, Forrest is visited by Jenny's ghost, who is not upset that he slept with another woman considering she is deceased, but in that he has not taken the <b>time</b> <b>nor</b> the <b>effort</b> to read what he is signing, and that trouble is ahead.|$|R
