5|$|In 2007, after {{a highly}} publicized feud between Finkelstein and an {{academic}} opponent, Alan Dershowitz, Finkelstein's tenure bid at DePaul was denied. Finkelstein was placed on administrative leave for the 2007–08 academic year, and on September 5, 2007, he announced his resignation after coming to a <b>settlement</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> university on generally undisclosed terms. An official statement from DePaul strongly defended the decision to deny Finkelstein tenure, stated that outside influence played {{no role in the}} decision.

5|$|In September 2012, the Swiss {{government}} gave banks like Credit Suisse {{permission to}} provide information to the US Justice Department for tax evasion probes. In February 2014 it agreed to pay a fine of $197 million after one of its businesses served 8,500 US clients without registering its activities, leading to suspicion {{as to whether it}} was helping Americans evade taxes. It was one of 14 Swiss banks under investigation. Separately, in 2013, German authorities began to probe Credit Suisse, its private bank subsidiary Clariden Leu, and its regional subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank for helping German citizens evade taxes. The bank eventually entered into a €150 million <b>settlement</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> government.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{believed}} that securing the states' accession to India {{was crucial to}} reaching a negotiated <b>settlement</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Congress for the transfer of power. As a relative of the British King, he was trusted {{by most of the}} princes and was a personal friend of many, especially the Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan. The princes also {{believed that}} he would {{be in a position to}} ensure that independent India adhered to any terms that might be agreed upon, because Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel had asked him to become the first Governor General of the Dominion of India.|$|E

5|$|On 1 December three {{prisoners in}} Armagh Women's Prison joined the strike, {{including}} Mairéad Farrell, {{followed by a}} short-lived hunger strike by several dozen more prisoners in HM Prison Maze. In a war of nerves between the IRA leadership and the British government, with McKenna lapsing {{in and out of}} a coma and on the brink of death, the government appeared to concede the essence of the prisoners' five demands with a thirty-page document detailing a proposed <b>settlement.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> document in transit to Belfast, Hughes took the decision to save McKenna's life and end the strike after 53 days on 18 December.|$|E

5|$|The <b>settlement</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Crusaders was {{accompanied}} by a proposed redistribution of the Ayyubid principalities whereby Damascus and its territories would by governed by al-Ashraf, who recognized al-Kamil's sovereignty. An-Nasir Dawud resisted the settlement, incensed by the Ayyubid-Crusader truce. Al-Kamil's forces reached Damascus to enforce the proposed agreement in May 1229. The siege put great pressure on the city, but the inhabitants rallied to an-Nasir Dawud, supportive of al-Mu'azzam's stable rule and angered at the treaty with Frederick. After one month, however, an-Nasir Dawud sued for a peaceful outcome and was given a new principality centered around Karak, while al-Ashraf, the governor of Diyar Bakr, assumed the governorship of Damascus.|$|E
50|$|The {{name of the}} {{settlement}} was changed from Koprivnik to Koprivnik v Bohinju (literally, 'Koprivnik in Bohinj') in 1955 to distinguish it from other <b>settlements</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same name in Slovenia.|$|R

5|$|To {{open the}} West to European immigration, {{parliament}} also approved sponsoring {{the construction of}} three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), opening the prairies to <b>settlement</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Dominion Lands Act, and establishing the North-West Mounted Police to assert its authority over this territory. In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, parliament created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.|$|E
5|$|While Edward was away, Salisbury was {{captured}} by the French at Lille in April 1340, and imprisoned in Paris. Reportedly, King Philip VI of France wanted to execute Salisbury and Robert Ufford, Earl of Suffolk, who {{was captured}} with him. Philip was, however, dissuaded by John of Bohemia, who argued that the earls could come in handy in an exchange, should any French noblemen be captured. Though released on parole in September, {{it was not until}} May 1342 that he reached a final <b>settlement</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> French. Salisbury was freed in a prisoner exchange, but only on the condition that he never fight in France again.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Sicumba, Alvarado led {{his army}} to the Indian village of Choloma, {{in the general}} region of Puerto de Caballos. On 27 June 1536, Pedro de Alvarado founded a Spanish town beside the Indian <b>settlement,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> name of Villa de Señor San Pedro de Puerto Caballos (modern San Pedro Sula). The new town had 35 Spanish citizens, and Alvarado allocated 200 of his slaves to help build the new town and work the surrounding fields. He sent out expeditions into outlying regions to secure the new town, extend the area of Spanish domination, and commandeer supplies. Alvarado annulled all encomienda rights established in the area under Cerezeda, and reassigned the villages {{to the citizens of}} San Pedro.|$|E
5000|$|Jánossomorja {{is a town}} in Győr-Moson-Sopron county, Hungary. It is a {{connection}} between the two villages Szentpéter and Szentjános, located close to the Austrian border.

50|$|During the Roman era {{there was}} a wide band of {{settlements}} that stretched from the Grosses Moos marsh up into the vineyard covered hills. A Roman road ran through the march and connected <b>the</b> <b>settlements</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Roman towns of the Swiss Plateau.|$|R
50|$|Sindarin {{eventually}} replaced Noldorin Quenya as {{the language}} used by the Noldor in Beleriand, even in predominantly Noldorin <b>settlements,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exception of Gondolin, where Turgon revived Quenya. Elsewhere, Quenya survived as a language of knowledge, taking the same role as Latin today.|$|R
5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at {{the time for a}} {{national}} candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a <b>settlement</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
5|$|Families of 45 of the 47 {{passengers}} sued Comair for negligence. (Families of {{the other}} two victims settled with the airline before filing litigation.) Three sample cases were due to be heard on August 4, 2008; but the trial was indefinitely postponed after Comair reached a <b>settlement</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> majority of the families. Cases brought by Comair against the airport authority and the FAA, arguing each should share in the compensation payments, are now resolved. The case against the airport authority was dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds, and this ruling was upheld by the Kentucky Supreme Court on October 1, 2009. In Comair's case against the United States, a settlement was reached with the United States agreeing to pay 22% of the liability for the crash, while Comair agreed to pay the remaining 78%.|$|E
5|$|Laurence died on 2February 619, and {{was buried}} in the abbey of St Peter and Paul in Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine's; his relics, or remains, were moved, or translated, to the new church of St Augustine's in 1091. His shrine was in the axial chapel of the abbey church, {{flanking}} the shrine of Augustine, his predecessor. Laurence came to be regarded as a saint, and was given the feast day of 3February. The ninth century Stowe Missal commemorates his feast day, along with Mellitus and Justus. A Vita (or Life) was written about the time of his translation, by Goscelin, but it is mainly based on information in Bede. His tomb was opened in 1915. Besides his feast day, the date of his translation, 13September, was also celebrated after his death. Laurence's tenure as archbishop is mainly remembered for his failure to secure a <b>settlement</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Celtic church, and for his reconversion of Eadbald following Æthelbert's death. He was succeeded as archbishop by Mellitus, the Bishop of London.|$|E
5000|$|The {{population}} of the Shaki District in early 2015 was 181,000 (90,300 men and 90,700 women), an increase since 2009, when it was 170,700. Shaki has 65 <b>settlements,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> majority of residents living in the cities (66,900) and a minority in villages (32,600).|$|R

50|$|The name Brje pri Koprivi {{literally}} means 'Brje near Kopriva'. The name Brje {{is derived}} from *Brjane 'hill dwellers', ultimately from Common Slavic *bьrdo 'hill'. Like other <b>settlements</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same name (e.g., Brje, Brje pri Komnu), it is thus a geographical designation for the original inhabitants.|$|R
5|$|McClellan was {{nominated}} by the Democrats {{to run against}} Abraham Lincoln in the 1864 U.S. presidential election. Following the example of Winfield Scott, he ran as a U.S. Army general still on active duty; he did not resign his commission until election day, November 8, 1864. McClellan supported continuation {{of the war and}} restoration of the Union (but not the abolition of slavery), but the party platform, written by Copperhead leader Clement Vallandigham of Ohio, was opposed to this position. The platform called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a negotiated <b>settlement</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Confederacy. McClellan was forced to repudiate the platform, which made his campaign inconsistent and difficult. He also was not helped by the party's choice for vice president, George H. Pendleton, a peace candidate from Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Oljeitu, {{also named}} Mohammad Khodabandeh, was {{great-grandson}} of Ilkhanate founder Hulagu, and brother and successor of Ghazan. In his youth he at first converted to Buddhism, {{and then later}} to Sunni Islam with his brother Ghazan, and changed his first name to the Islamic Muhammad. In April 1305, Oljeitu sent letters to Philip IV of France, Pope Clement V, and Edward I of England. As had his predecessors, Oljeitu offered a military collaboration between the Mongols and the Christian nations of Europe, against the Mamluks. European nations prepared a crusade, but were delayed. In the meantime Oljeitu launched a last campaign against the Mamluks (1312–1313), {{in which he was}} unsuccessful. A final <b>settlement</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Mamluks would only be found when Oljeitu's son Abu Sa'id signed the Treaty of Aleppo in 1322.|$|E
5|$|The British {{expedition}} {{was led by}} Vice-Admiral Sir George Keith Elphinstone {{and sailed}} in April 1795, arriving off Simon's Town at the cape in June. Attempts were made to negotiate a <b>settlement</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> colony, but talks achieved nothing and an amphibious landing was made on 7 August. A short battle was fought at Muizenberg, and skirmishing between British and Dutch forces continued until September when a larger military force landed. With Cape Town under threat, Dutch governor, Abraham Josias Sluysken, surrendered the colony. Elphinstone subsequently strengthened the garrison against counterattack and stationed a Royal Navy squadron off the port. Almost a year later a Dutch reinforcement convoy reached the colony {{only to find that}} it was badly outnumbered, and surrendered without a fight. The British occupation continued until the Peace of Amiens in 1802 when it was returned to the Dutch. In 1806, during the Napoleonic Wars, a second British invasion reoccupied the colony after the Battle of Blaauwberg and it remained a British colony until the establishment of the Union of South Africa in 1910.|$|E
