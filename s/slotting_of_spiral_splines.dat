On the basis of this, referred to the designing and checking criterion of the straight-tooth <b>spline</b> transmission and <b>spiral</b> transmission, the calculation methods of the surface extrusion stress (or pressure) <b>of</b> the <b>spiral</b> <b>spline</b> teeth side, the shear stress and the max-flexural stress <b>of</b> the <b>spiral</b> <b>spline</b> teeth root, and the equivalent stress of the screw bolt were derived, and the checking criterions for them were put forward. An example, the surface extrusion stress through the calculation methods compared with that through ANSYS Workbench simulation, verifies the calculation methods of the surface extrusion stress (or pressure) <b>of</b> the <b>spiral</b> <b>spline</b> teeth side...|$|R
40|$|Collocating <b>spiral</b> <b>splines</b> {{are derived}} as an {{approximation}} to {{the curve of}} least energy. The defining equations, although nonlinear, are easily solved because the Jacobian matrix has banded structure. A simple but effective iterative scheme for the solution of these equations is described together with a useful scheme for determining initial approximations for nonlinear splines. The resulting curve is invariant with respect to translation and rotation of axes and is usually much smoother than is possible with polynomial splines because the curvature <b>of</b> the <b>spiral</b> <b>spline</b> varies linearly with respect to arc length...|$|R

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>slotted</b> <b>spiral</b> {{technique}} on {{an antenna}} that covers octal bands of WWAN/LTE {{has been studied}} and discussed in this paper. The <b>Slotted</b> <b>Spiral</b> consists <b>of</b> strips arranged together forming a <b>spiral</b> <b>of</b> different vertical and horizontal width. The antenna has been initially designed without employing the slotted structure to cover the frequency bands GPS l 2 band- 1227. 60 /l 3 band 1381. 05, DCS 1800 /PCS 1900 / UMTS 2100 LTE 2300 / 2500 / 2600 (1710 – 2690 MHz). The size of the antenna was initially 15 x 40 mm 2. Then the structure has been designed employing the slotted spiral technique which provides a size reduction from 15 x 40 mm 2 to 15 x 38 mm 2 which is small enough to be incorporated in a tablet computer. Furthermore the use of embedded parallel resonant structure aids in implementing slotted spiral technique. The antenna after employing size reduction provided a low return loss and good radiation efficiency and high gain than the antenna without slotted spiral...|$|R
40|$|In {{the range}} of milliwatt to a few watts cooling capacity, Stirling cycle and pulse tube coolers are most {{suitable}} for producing cryogenic temperatures owing to their eco-friendliness, high efficiency, cooling capacity to mass ratio etc. The compressor of a Stirling cooler {{is powered by a}} linear motor. The power piston of the cooler is held in position and moves to and fro with the support of so called flexure springs or flexure bearings. Flexures avoid direct contact between moving parts of the compressor of the cooler. Thus, if designed adequately to withstand fatigue, flexure bearings can easily outlast rolling element bearings and slider bearings. In this work, a computational analysis is used to study the performance of flexure spring by varying the geometrical parameters. Three of the most common spring materials namely, SS 304, beryllium copper and spring steel are considered for analysis. The analysis was made by varying the parameters like spiral sweep angle, <b>slot</b> width, number <b>of</b> <b>spirals</b> and disc thickness. The influence of each of these parameters on the fatigue life of the spring has been investigated. The results suggest that flexure springs <b>of</b> three <b>spiral</b> arms would be the ideal choice for the selected cryocooler. The variation of stress developed with respect to different design parameters and fatigue damage factor are presented graphically. ...|$|R

The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a <b>spiral</b> <b>spline</b> or gun-barrel rifling.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of economical construction of infrastructures has recently increased. The application <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> steel pipes to bridge piers is {{considered as one}} of the effective methods. Spiral steel pipes have been seldom used for bridge piers. Currently, spiral steel pipes have been mainly used as the foundations of buildings or bridges and are relatively economical because they are produced in large quantities in factories. However, roll forming processes <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> steel pipes are different from those of bending roll pipes which have been generally used as bridge piers, so that seismic performance <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> steel pipes may be different from that of bending roll pipes. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} grasp the ultimate strength and the ductility <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> steel pipes. In this study, the finite element analysis was conducted for grasping the elasto-plastic behavior <b>of</b> hollow <b>spiral</b> steel pipes. Based on the analysis results, the seismic performance <b>of</b> hollow <b>spiral</b> steel pipes under compressive axial force and bending moment was examined and the influences of the structural parameters on the seismic performances <b>of</b> the <b>spiral</b> steel pipes are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} <b>of</b> a <b>spiral</b> {{arterial blood}} flow pattern in both {{animals and humans}} has been widely accepted. The effect <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> flow on physiological processes associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development and progressions can provide valuable information. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the influence <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> flow on haemodynamic changes in an elastic AAA model by implementing a coupled fluid–structure interaction (FSI) analysis. The results showed that an increase in the intensity <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> flow resulted in an increase in maximum wall shear stress (WSS) and a decrease in maximum wall stress; however, the spiral flow effect on the WSS was higher than the wall stress. It was also shown that not taking into consideration the effect <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> flow in modelling of AAA can underestimate the magnitude of WSS by up to 30 % and overestimate the magnitude of wall stress by up to 11 %. The presence <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> flow within AAAs is associated with beneficial and detrimental effects. The beneficial effects are to reduce the wall stress and the size of regions with low WSS which in turn reduce the risk of rupture, endothelial dysfunction and the development of atherosclerosis. However, the increase in magnitude of WSS is seen as the detrimental effect <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> flow. 9 page(s...|$|R
