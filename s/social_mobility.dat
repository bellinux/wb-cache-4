40|$|First, a {{regional}} {{analysis of the}} <b>social</b> <b>mobilities</b> {{of men and women}} nonmigrants is carried out. Second, the way in which regional context structures the options open to men and women is discussed, and, third, the fortunes of male and female interregional migrants are traced. The principal empirical results are: (1) that nonmigrant <b>social</b> <b>mobilities</b> have gender-specific spatial structures; (2) that this gender specificity is greater for upward than for downward social mobility; (3) that women are especially likely to be upwardly mobile in the South East region, and particularly so for entry into managerial posts; (4) that migrant <b>social</b> <b>mobilities</b> have gender-specific spatial structures; (5) that flows to the South East involve upward <b>social</b> <b>mobilities</b> both for men and for women but are relatively to the advantage of women's careers; and (6) that flows from the South East often involve the exit of women from the labour market, imply sideways or upward mobility for men, but are strongly to the disadvantage of women's employment careers. ...|$|R

Since many current <b>social</b> based <b>mobility</b> models give nodes freedom in terms of movement according to social feeling and attractivity to other nodes or places, we {{focus more on the}} mandatory part of our life, such as going to work and school. In the case of students, this mandatory part of their life is studying in university according to their schedule. In their free time, they move and behave according to attractivity to other nodes or places of their origin.

This dislocation provokes a fear of loss of memory and history in the white Zimbabwean community and therefore triggers a desire to preserve history and memory, which are central in identity formation.

5|$|Nobles, {{who were}} {{believed}} to be direct descendants of the descended person from heaven, lived in tongkonans, while commoners lived in less lavish houses (bamboo shacks called banua).

Sometimes nobles married Bugis or Makassarese nobles. Commoners and slaves were prohibited from having death feasts. Despite close kinship and status inheritance, there was some <b>social</b> <b>mobility,</b> as marriage or change in wealth could affect an individuals status.

5|$|Social {{stratification}} is {{the hierarchical}} arrangement of individuals into social classes, castes, and divisions within a society. Modern Western societies stratification traditionally relates to {{cultural and economic}} classes arranged in three main layers: upper class, middle class, and lower class, but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. occupational). Social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of structural functionalism suggest that, since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. Conflict theorists, by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> in stratified societies.|$|E

While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.|$|E
5|$|The {{blurring}} or {{diffusion of}} the Republic's more rigid hierarchies led to increased <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> under the Empire, both upward and downward, {{to an extent}} that exceeded that of all other well-documented ancient societies. Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them. Social life in the Empire, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited, was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and confraternities (collegia and sodalitates) formed for various purposes: professional and trade guilds, veterans' groups, religious sodalities, drinking and dining clubs, performing arts troupes, and burial societies.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1920s, {{the role of the}} Catholic Church grew. This was {{encouraged}} by the Belgian government, since the priests knew the country well and facilitated its administration. Many Rwandans (including elite Tutsi) converted, since Catholicism was an increasing prerequisite for social advancement. King Musinga refused to convert, and in 1931 he was deposed by the Belgian administration; his eldest son, Mutara III Rudahigwa, succeeded him and eventually became Rwanda's first Christian king. During the 1930s the Belgians introduced large-scale projects in education, health, public works and agricultural supervision, including new crops and agricultural techniques to improve food supply. Though Rwanda was modernised the Tutsis remained in power, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised and subject to large-scale forced labour. In 1935 Belgium introduced identity cards, labelling an individual as Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. Although wealthy Hutu had previously been able to become honorary Tutsi, the identity cards ended further <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{continued}} to rule Rwanda as a UN Trust Territory after World War II, with {{a mandate to}} oversee its eventual independence. The economic landscape had changed considerably during the war; a cash economy grew, {{and with it the}} demand for labourers in the Congolese mines of Katanga and the coffee and sugar plantations of Uganda. There was a simultaneous shift in the Catholic Church; prominent figures in the early Rwandan church, who were from a wealthy and conservative background (such as Léon-Paul Classe), were replaced by younger clergy of working-class origin. Of these, a greater proportion were Flemish rather than Walloon Belgians and sympathised with the plight of the Hutu. Economic conditions and the seminary education provided by the church gave the Hutu a <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> not previously possible, allowing the development of an elite group of Hutu leaders and intellectuals. This group, consisting of Hutu from the precolonial Kingdom of Rwanda, was joined by prominent citizens of kingdoms acquired during colonialism (including the Kiga).|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War Birmingham's booming economy, its {{expanding}} population, and its resulting high levels of <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> and cultural pluralism, had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas. Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society, and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak. The town's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643, and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as a haven for Nonconformists from the 1660s.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{a decline}} in <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> for those of less {{prominent}} clans, the local elites became far more integrated into a nationwide upper class social structure during the Eastern Han period, thus expanding the classification of who belonged to the upper class. The emerging gentry class—which became fully consolidated during the Eastern Han—consisted of unemployed scholars, teachers, students, and government officials. These men, although geographically separated and mired in local activities, started to view themselves as participants in wider national affairs of politics and scholarship. They recognized shared values of filial piety, deference, and emphasizing study in the Five Classics over holding public office. Emperors Yuan and Cheng were forced to abandon their resettlement schemes for officials and their families around the royal tombs settlement in 40 BCE and 15 BCE, respectively; unlike the days of Emperor Wu, historian Cho-Yun Hsu asserts {{that at this point}} officials and scholars had so much influence in both local and national-level politics that to forcibly relocate them became unthinkable.|$|E

Despite his police record, in 1963 he began training at the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi, alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata. The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> for underprivileged Libyans, and Gaddafi recognized it as a potential instrument of political change. Under Idris, Libya's armed forces were trained by the British military; this angered Gaddafi, who viewed the British as imperialists, and accordingly he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers, ultimately failing his exams. British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour, stating their suspicion {{that he was involved}} in the assassination of the military academy's commander in 1963.
