5|$|Only recently, the {{assembly}} {{process of the}} 19S regulatory particle has been elucidated to considerable extent. The 19S regulatory particle assembles as two distinct subcomponents, the base and the lid. Assembly of the base complex is facilitated by four assembly chaperones, Hsm3/S5b, Nas2/p27, Rpn14/PAAF1, and Nas6/gankyrin (names for yeast/mammals). These assembly chaperones bind to the AAA-ATPase subunits and their main function <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> ensure proper assembly of the heterohexameric AAA-ATPase ring. To date it is still under debate whether the base complex assembles separately, whether {{the assembly}} is templated by the 20S core particle, or whether alternative assembly pathways exist. In addition to the four assembly chaperones, the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6/Usp14 also promotes base assembly, {{but it is not}} essential. The lid assembles separately in a specific order and does not require assembly chaperones.|$|E

Her main role in life <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> annoy and embarrass her sister. She is {{everything}} that Agnes dislikes. Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias {{that he would be}} better off if he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she will never know whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes it sound as if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{reputation}} of Tacitus' Germania is somewhat marred {{as a historical}} source by the writer's rhetorical tendencies. The main purpose of his writing <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> hold up examples of virtue and vice for his fellow Romans rather than give a truthful ethnographic or historical account. While Tacitus' interpretations are sometimes dubious, the names and basic facts he reports are credible; Tacitus touches on several elements of Germanic culture known from later sources. Human and animal sacrifice is attested by archaeological evidence and medieval sources. Rituals tied to natural features are found both in medieval sources and in Nordic folklore. A ritual chariot or wagon as described by Tacitus was excavated in the Oseberg find. Sources from medieval times until the 19th century point to divination by making predictions or finding {{the will of the}} gods from randomized phenomena as a tradition among Germanic cultures.|$|E

25|$|Adam Branson : Adam is Tender's older twin brother. Because {{he was the}} firstborn, Adam got {{to stay in the}} Church {{community}} in Nebraska and marry, while Tender was among those sent to earn a living for the Church in the outside world. Adam is the person who leaked the community's illegal activities to the police ten years {{prior to the start of}} the novel, which was the event that instigated the community's mass suicide. Since then, Adam has been traveling the country, killing surviving members of the Church and masking the murders as suicides in order to motivate further suicides. His motivations are unclear. His goal <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> completely eradicate the Creedish beliefs and challenge the Church at its core. He also may see his actions as merciful to the victims of the cult brainwashing. In the course of the novel, he also kills the caseworker and the agent, making Tender the prime suspect in both murders. Adam and Fertility help Tender escape from the police as they come to arrest him, and as the brothers travel north in hiding, they return to the Creedish Church Compound, which is now the Sensitive Materials Sanitary Landfill. As they argue over their memories of the Creedish way of life, Tender crashes the car, which sends a dashboard figurine (of Tender) into Adam's eye. Adam forces Tender to beat him with a rock, thereby killing him.|$|E
25|$|Assembly of the virion uses two {{scaffolding}} proteins, internal scaffolding protein B {{and external}} scaffolding protein D. The function of protein B <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> lower {{the amount of}} protein D needed by the virion for assembly. Protein H is a multifunctional structural protein required for piloting the viral DNA into the host cell interior during the entry process. Protein E is a 91-amino acid membrane protein that causes host cell lysis by inhibiting the host translocase MraY. This inhibitory activity is located within the N terminal 29 amino acids. Protein A is a single strand endonuclease and {{is responsible for the}} initiation of viral DNA replication. It catalyses cleavage and ligation of a phosphodiester bond between a G and A nucleotide residue pair at the phi X origin. It may not be essential for phage viability but burst sizes are reduced by 50% when it is mutated. Protein A* inhibits host DNA replication. Unlike protein A it is capable of cleaving the phi X viral DNA in the presence of single-stranded binding protein of the host. Protein A*, like Protein A, may not be required for phage viability. Protein C increases the fidelity of the termination and reinitiation reactions and is required for the packagaing of the viral DNA in to the protein shell. Protein K has 56 amino acids and is found in the membrane of the host cell. It appears to be able to increase the burst size of the virus.|$|E
25|$|HbS {{has a lower}} {{negative}} charge at physiological pH than does normal adult hemoglobin. The consequences of the simple replacement of a charged amino acid with a hydrophobic, neutral amino acid are far ranging, Recent studies in West Africa suggest that the greatest impact of Hb S <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> protect against either death or severe disease—that is, profound anemia or cerebral malaria—while having less effect on infection per se. Children who are heterozygous for the sickle cell gene have only one- tenth {{the risk of death}} from falciparum as do those who are homozygous for the normal hemoglobin gene. Binding of parasitized sickle erythrocytes to endothelial cells and blood monocytes is significantly reduced due to an altered display of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP-1), the parasite’s major cytoadherence ligand and virulence factor on the erythrocyte surface. Protection also derives from the instability of sickle hemoglobin, which clusters the predominant integral red cell membrane protein (called band 3) and triggers accelerated removal by phagocytic cells. Natural antibodies recognize these clusters on senescent erythrocytes. Protection by HbAS involves the enhancement of not only innate but also of acquired immunity to the parasite. Prematurely denatured sickle hemoglobin results in an up regulation of natural antibodies which control erythrocyte adhesion in both malaria and sickle cell disease. Targeting the stimuli that lead to endothelial activation will constitute a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit sickle red cell adhesion and vasco-occlusion.|$|E

500|$|In March 1897 {{as members}} of the Household {{prepared}} to depart for Cimiez for the Queen's annual visit, they insisted that Karim not accompany the royal party, and decided to resign if he did so. When Harriet Phipps, one of the Queen's maids of honour, informed her of the collective decision, the Queen swept the contents of her desk onto the floor in a fury. The Household backed down, but the holiday was marred by increased resentment and rows between the Household and Victoria. She thought their distrust and dislike of Karim was motivated by [...] "race prejudice" [...] and jealousy. When Rafiuddin Ahmed joined Karim in Cimiez, the Household forced him to leave, which Victoria thought [...] "disgraceful", and she asked the prime minister to issue an apology to Ahmed, explaining he was only excluded because he had written articles in newspapers and pressmen were not permitted. Ponsonby wrote in late April, [...] " [...] happens to be a thoroughly stupid and uneducated man, and his one idea in life <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> do nothing and to eat as much as he can." [...] Reid warned the Queen that her attachment to Karim had led to questions about her sanity, and Hamilton telegraphed to Elgin requesting information on the Munshi and his family in an effort to discredit him. On receiving Elgin's reply that they were [...] "Respectable and trustworthy... but position of family humble", Hamilton concluded [...] "the Munshi has done nothing to my knowledge which is reprehensible or deserving of official stricture... enquiries wd not be right, unless they were in connection with some definite statement or accusation." [...] He did, however, authorise further investigation of the [...] "Mohamedan intriguer named Rafiuddin". Nothing was ever proven against Ahmed, who later became a Bombay government official and was knighted in 1932. The effect of the row, in Hamilton's words, was [...] "to put him [...] more into his humble place, and his influence will not be the same in the future".|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{extensive}} examination of the question came in 1998 in Stephen Roy Miller's edition of A Shrew for the New Cambridge Shakespeare: The Early Quartos series. Miller agrees with most modern scholars that A Shrew is derived from The Shrew, {{but he does not}} believes it to be a bad quarto. Instead, he argues it is an adaptation by someone other than Shakespeare. Miller believes Alexander's suggestion in 1969 that the reporter became confused is unlikely, and instead suggests an adapter at work; [...] "the most economic explanation of indebtedness is that whoever compiled A Shrew borrowed the lines from Shakespeare's The Shrew, or a version of it, and adapted them." [...] Part of Miller's evidence relates to Gremio, who has no counterpart in A Shrew. In The Shrew, after the wedding, Gremio expresses doubts {{as to whether or not}} Petruchio will be able to tame Katherina. In A Shrew, these lines are extended and split between Polidor (the equivalent of Hortensio) and Phylema (Bianca). As Gremio does have a counterpart in I Suppositi, Miller concludes that [...] "to argue the priority of A Shrew in this case would mean arguing that Shakespeare took the negative hints from the speeches of Polidor and Phylema and gave them to a character he resurrected from Supposes. This is a less economical argument than to suggest that the compiler of A Shrew, dismissing Gremio, simply shared his doubts among the characters available." [...] He argues there is even evidence in the play that the compiler knew he was working within a specific literary tradition; [...] "as with his partial change of character names, the compiler seems to wish to produce dialogue much like his models, but not the same. For him, adaptation includes exact quotation, imitation and incorporation of his own additions. This seems to define his personal style, and his aim <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> produce his own version, presumably intended that it should be tuned more towards the popular era than The Shrew." ...|$|E
