500|$|Grohl and Jones {{produced}} the record across {{a period of}} one week in October 1994, with Grohl on vocals and all instruments. Both would arrive {{in the morning at}} Robert Lang Studios, start production by noon and do four songs a day. According to Grohl, during the recording process he would run from room to room, [...] "still sweating and shaking from playing drums and [...] pick up the guitar and put down a track, do the bass, maybe another guitar part, have a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and then go in and do the next song". The only performance by an outsider was a guitar part on [...] "X-Static" [...] provided by Greg Dulli of The Afghan Whigs, who was watching Grohl record the songs. Grohl eventually asked him if he wanted to play and handed him a guitar. Each song took about 45 minutes to be completed, and the compositions were recorded in the same order that became the album's track listing. The only song that required two run-throughs before completion was [...] "I'll Stick Around". Grohl was insecure about his singing, and added effects to his voice in [...] "Floaty", and tried to enhance the performance through double track – [...] "You know how people double their vocals to make them stronger? That album the vocals are quadrupled." ...|$|E
60|$|Conversation {{broke out}} with the first <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and the calm of the {{restaurant}} was shattered. Its day had begun.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ain't no next life," [...] Matt answered, pausing {{from the}} steak {{to take his}} first <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> [...] "Nor heaven nor hell, nor nothin'. You get all that's comin' {{right here in this}} life." ...|$|E
60|$|She said 'Perhaps' {{between the}} <b>sips</b> <b>of</b> her <b>coffee.</b> And {{the sound of}} her taking her breath in the word, was nauseous to him. He rose quickly to be away from her.|$|R
5000|$|Unusually for him, Farner {{wrote the}} lyric {{of the song}} first, with the words coming {{to him in the}} middle of the night after saying prayers for {{inspiration}} to write something meaningful. [...] The chord changes to [...] "Im Your Captain" [...] came to him the following morning between <b>sips</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and the following day he took it to the band. [...] They immediately liked it and began jamming on it and working out their parts at a local union hall in their hometown of Flint, Michigan where they usually did their rehearsals.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Hum!' he said. Then 'Umph!' in a protesting tone, as {{if someone}} had pinched him. Finally, he gave vent to a long-drawn 'Um-m-m,' in a deep bass. 'Most extraordinary. Really, most extraordinary. Exceedingly. Yes. Um. Very.' He took a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E
6000|$|By {{this time}} the {{sunshine}} was pouring in through the screening and across the bed. On {{the outside of the}} wire screen clung a number of house-flies, early-hatched for the season and numb with the night's cold. As Forrest ate he watched the hunting of the meat-eating yellow- jackets. Sturdy, more frost-resistant than bees, they were already on the wing and preying on the benumbed flies. Despite the rowdy noise of their flight, these yellow hunters of the air, with rarely ever a miss, pounced on their helpless victims and sailed away with them. The last fly was gone ere Forrest had sipped his last <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> marked [...] "Commercial Breeding of Frogs" [...] with a match, and taken up his proofsheets.|$|E
6000|$|Dinner lasted two hours; the Empress rising, Friedrich Wilhelm {{leads her}} to her room; then retires to his own, and [...] "in {{a quarter of an}} hour" [...] is visited there by the Kaiser; [...] "who conducts him," [...] in so many minutes exact by the watch, [...] "back to the Empress,"--for a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> as one hopes; which may wind up the Interview well. The sun is still a good space from setting, when Friedrich Wilhelm, after cordial adieus, neglectful of etiquette, is rolling rapidly towards Nimburg, thirty miles off on the Prag Highway; and Kaiser Karl with his Spouse move {{deliberately}} towards Chlumetz to hunt again. In Nimburg Friedrich Wilhelm sleeps, that night;--Imperial Majesties, in a much-tumbled world, of wild horses, ceremonial ewers, and Eugenios of Savoy and Malplaquet, probably peopling his dreams. If it please Heaven, there may be another private meeting, a day or two hence.|$|E
50|$|Triveni {{was destined}} to be a martyr. On the night of December 31, 2003, he danced and enjoyed the party at the Army Club, Pathankot with his family members and friends. In {{the wee hours of the}} New Year day he left the club saying “ you will not see us again”. After taking some <b>sips</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> at home on that day he left home for his unit and got himself busy in his daily routine of {{inspecting}} the arms of his colleagues in the Quick Reaction Team. He was in his combat uniform ready for any mission.|$|R
60|$|More double knocks! what an {{extensive}} party! what an incessant hum of conversation and general <b>sipping</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee!</b> We see Tupple now, in our mind’s eye, in {{the height of}} his glory. He has just handed that stout old lady’s cup to the servant; and now, he dives among the crowd of young men by the door, to intercept the other servant, and secure the muffin-plate for the old lady’s daughter, before he leaves the room; and now, as he passes the sofa on his way back, he bestows a glance of recognition and patronage upon the young ladies as condescending and familiar as if he had known them from infancy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{conceive}} {{whom you}} mean," [...] said Lady Mallinger, who in fact {{had not been}} listening, her mind having been taken up with her first <b>sips</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> the objectionable cuff of her sleeve, {{and the necessity of}} carrying Theresa to the dentist--innocent and partly laudable preoccupations, as the gentle lady's usually were. Should her appearance be inquired after, let it be said that she had reddish blonde hair (the hair of the period), a small Roman nose, rather prominent blue eyes and delicate eyelids, with a figure which her thinner friends called fat, her hands showing curves and dimples like a magnified baby's.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hamilton Fynes {{discovered}} that place of entertainment without difficulty, ordered for himself {{a cup of}} coffee and a sandwich, and drew a chair close up to the small open fire, taking care, however, to sit almost facing the only entrance to the room. He laid his hat upon the counter, close to which he had taken up his position, and smoothed back with his left hand his somewhat thick black hair. He was a man, apparently of middle age, of middle height, clean-shaven, with good but undistinguished features, dark eyes, very clear and very bright, which showed, indeed, but little need of the pince-nez which hung by a thin black cord from his neck. His hat, low in the crown and of soft gray felt, would alone have betrayed his nationality. His clothes, however, were also American in cut. His boots were narrow and of unmistakable shape. He ate his sandwich with suspicion, and after his first <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> ordered a whiskey and soda. Afterwards he sat leaning back in his chair, glancing every now and then at the clock, but otherwise manifesting no signs of impatience. In less than half an hour an inspector, cap in hand, entered the room and announced that everything was ready. Mr. Hamilton Fynes put on his hat, picked up his suitcase, and followed him on to the platform. A long saloon carriage, with a guard's brake behind and an engine in front, was waiting there.|$|E
5000|$|On January 29, 2010, WGN-TV aired an {{interview}} that Richards conducted with actor Mel Gibson via a remote feed about his new movie, Edge of Darkness, and then queried Gibson about how the public perceives him, given his noted drunken outburst and anti-Semitic rant while being arrested in 2006. The line of questioning annoyed Gibson, who told Richards, [...] "That's almost four years ago, dude. I mean, I've moved on. I guess you haven't." [...] After the interview, Gibson—unaware that the camera was still rolling {{and that he was}} still on air—took a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and used the term [...] "asshole," [...] presumably directed at Richards. Gibson and his publicist both later claimed that the remark was directed at Gibson's publicist; a remark later proven false by insiders who were in the studio with Gibson at the time.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2008, on {{her show}} Rachael Ray {{reviewed}} several products that contained caffeine. One of those products was SpazzStick. The show had three reviewers and a medical doctor, Jeanine Downy, {{as part of}} a panel reviewing the caffeinated products. Downy observed that caffeine is not effective unless it is ingested or absorbed through thin skin such as the mouth; thus SpazzStick and the toothpaste were the two products she expected would have the best results. The viewer who tested the SpazzStick swore that it provided the expected energy burst and that she would use it every day. Downy, however, warned that care should be taken in using the product since it did not come with SPF protection. (Spazzstick is now SPF 15) Similarly, a review by EnergyDrinkReviews stated, [...] "The power of the stuff is hard to quantify. I put it on and within a minute or two I definitely got a kick ... a very noticeable one too." [...] It is estimated that each application of SpazzStick gives the wearer the equivalent of a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E

60|$|If Hugh {{could have}} known what was to happen very soon after he had muttered these words to himself, as he wiped his hot face, and took the last <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coffee</b> to quench his thirst, {{he would have been}} sorry he uttered them, and have forgiven his brother everything.|$|R
60|$|The Giantess {{poured out}} another cup {{and set it}} on the floor for Woot. It was as big as a tub, and the golden spoon in the saucer beside the cup was so heavy the boy could {{scarcely}} lift it. But Woot managed to get a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coffee</b> and found it delicious.|$|R

5000|$|Tom {{manages to}} clear his ears out {{and is able to}} hear the sounds of the jungle. Soon after, Jerry pokes his head out of a gun's barrel and taunts Tom. Tom tries to grab Jerry, but his owner {{immediately}} yells to him [...] "DON'T TOUCH MY GUNS!!!", which scares Tom off of the basket and onto the elephant's buckle. To make matters worse, Jerry unbuckles the belt, causing Tom to fall off. Later, the owner manages as he falls off. Tom's owner, blaming Tom for the act, angrily traps him in the overturned basket and the elephant walks off without them. The two attempt {{to get back on the}} elephant, but fail, and just as the owner prepares to punch Tom, they are both interrupted by the thunderous roar of a lion. Frightened, the owner reaches back for Tom to hand him a gun for self defense as Tom searches the basket. Jerry hands him with a thermos and he gives it to Tom's owner. As the hunter fights the lion, Jerry puts his hat over his chest in mourning sarcastically, sobbing. After defeating the lion, the scratched-up and irritated owner takes a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> from the thermos and counts all the way to ten before clobbering Tom over his head with a thermos.|$|E

40|$|This article {{chronicles the}} author’s journey of writing short stories. Following an opening story, the author {{explains}} how she wrote {{short stories and}} field notes during her study of Head Start policy Initially, the stories captured the author’s emotive and physical memories of mundane and extraordinary events. Later, {{with the help of}} Norman Denzin, the stories became part of a research text. Acknowledging that researchers are encouraged to write experimental texts, the author argues that there are few exemplars in educational research of such work. The author then describes and shows how she combined short stories with connecting text. The connecting text provides historical and cultural background on policies depicted in the story. The article concludes by raising questions about how short stories will be evaluated by qualitative methodologists and other researchers.

40|$|It was a brisk fall day in Boston—the type of {{day that}} Dr. William Castle {{preferred}} {{to start with}} a cup of coffee while he caught up on his correspondence, which often appeared to be an endless task. As a faculty member of Harvard Medical School, he had always received a fair amount of inquiries, but after he had published his data indicating that pernicious anemia was due to a vitamin B 12 deficiency, the amount of mail he received was sometimes overwhelming. Sitting in his reclining chair he sorted through the large pile that had accumulated. He began to meticulously segregate it into smaller piles he would open in a prescribed order. Usually the delegation of a particular envelope was a relatively easy choice. There were a few that caused him to pause for a moment, such as the one he was currently holding. The return address indicated it was from an Irving Sherman at Johns Hopkins University. Since it was from someone he had never heard of, he was inclined to place it in the pile to be opened later. But on this day he decided to take another <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and see what Mr. Sherman had to say (see next page). * Disclaimer: This case is a work of fiction that refers to real events and people. All of the discoveries mentioned in Section 1 were made by the individuals they are attributed to, as were the observations made by Dr. Vernon Hahn described in Section 2. The time between discoveries has been dramatically condensed, however. Every effort has been made to present the scientific considerations concisely and accurately. Any errors should be attributed to the author and not the original investigators...|$|E

6000|$|... 'We {{go first}} to the café, where many French and Italians eat the breakfast. They like my music, and often give me <b>sips</b> <b>of</b> hot <b>coffee,</b> which I like much. You too shall have the sips, and perhaps the pennies, for these people are greatly kind,' said Tommo, leading her into a large smoky place where many people sat at little tables, eating and drinking. 'See, now, have no fear; give them [...] "Bella Monica;" [...] that is merry and will make the laugh,' whispered Tommo, tuning his harp.|$|R
60|$|I remembered. His {{handsome}} old face, {{so fresh}} for his age, unmarked by any trying experience, appeared haggard for an instant. It {{was like the}} passing of a shadow. Returning his steadfast gaze, I took a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> my black <b>coffee.</b> He was systematically minute in his narrative, simply in order, I think, not to let his excitement {{get the better of}} him.|$|R

5000|$|In 1915 Cheek-Neal {{began using}} a [...] "Good {{to the last}} drop" [...] slogan to {{advertise}} their Maxwell House Coffee. For several years, the ads {{made no mention of}} Theodore Roosevelt as the phrase's originator. By the 1930s, however, the company was running advertisements that claimed that the former president had taken a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> Maxwell House <b>Coffee</b> on a visit to Andrew Jackson's estate, The Hermitage, near Nashville on October 21, 1907, and when served coffee, he proclaimed it to be [...] "good to the last drop". During this time, Coca-Cola also used the slogan [...] "Good to the last drop". Later, Maxwell House distanced itself from its original claim, admitting that the slogan was written by Clifford Spiller, former president of General Foods Corporation, and did not come from a Roosevelt remark overheard by Cheek-Neal. The phrase remains a registered trademark of the product and appears on its logo.|$|R
60|$|Then one day {{our eyes}} met: {{not in a}} fashionable restaurant, I may tell you, but in a {{discreet}} one situated {{on the slopes of}} Montmartre. I was there alone, <b>sipping</b> a cup <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> after a frugal dinner. I had drifted in there chiefly because I had quite accidentally caught sight of M. le Marquis de Firmin-Latour walking arm-in-arm up the Rue Lepic with a lady who was both youthful and charming--a well-known dancer at the opera. Presently I saw him turn into that discreet little restaurant, where, in very truth, it was not likely that Mme. la Marquise would follow him. But I did. What made me do it, I cannot say; but for some time now it had been my wish to make the personal acquaintance of M. de Firmin-Latour, and I lost no opportunity which might help me to attain this desire.|$|R
60|$|But Jacobus's bodily reality {{did not fit}} in {{with this}} romantic view. When he turned up on board in the usual course, he <b>sipped</b> the cup <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> placidly, asked me if I was satisfied--and I hardly listened to the harbour gossip he dropped slowly in his low, voice-saving enunciation. I had then {{troubles}} of my own. My ship chartered, my thoughts dwelling {{on the success of}} a quick round voyage, I had been suddenly confronted by a shortage of bags. A catastrophe! The stock of one especial kind, called pockets, seemed to be totally exhausted. A consignment was shortly expected--it was afloat, on its way, but, meantime, the loading of my ship dead stopped, I had enough to worry about. My consignees, who had received me with such heartiness on my arrival, now, in the character of my charterers, listened to my complaints with polite helplessness. Their manager, the old-maidish, thin man, who so prudishly didn't even like to speak about the impure Jacobus, gave me the correct commercial view of the position.|$|R
