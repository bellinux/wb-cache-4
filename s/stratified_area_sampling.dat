40|$|Brand personality, {{as one of}} {{the major}} {{components}} of brand identity, is a significant determinant of brand equity. This study investigates the configural invariance of a 42 -item brand personality scale that was suggested by Aaker (1997) by extending its use from her U. S. sample to Anglophone and Francophone ethnic groups and some popular brands in Canada. Following a translation of the brand personality scale from English to French and two pilot studies for selecting 30 brands for the study, a <b>stratified</b> <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> plan was executed to collect data from Anglophones and Francophones in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. 1959 questionnaires were distributed by field workers using area sampling within each selected census tract and 596 usable responses were received by mail. After classifying the respondents into Anglophones or Francophones in terms of their responses to a multi-item scale involving language use and self-identification of ethnicity, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess the configural invariance of the brand personality scale. The results suggest that the factor structure for both ethnic groups are different than the structure suggested by Aaker (1997) for her U. S. study. Exploratory factor analysis of the data for each ethnic group suggests five factors as in Aaker's study. However, the composition of the factors in terms of the items of the scale is different from hers. The orthogonal rotation of the factor pattern matrices to congruence shows that the factor loadings for the two Canadian ethnic groups are very similar...|$|E
40|$|Recently, SMIDEC has {{extended}} its instrument, acronym SCORE, {{to measure the}} 'state of health' of SMEs in the distributive sector. Through this tool, SMEs are rated against six dimensions of capabilities: management, financial, compliance, stock management, marketing, and operations management. The outcome provides an input in identifying the appropriate incentive/assistance and in linking potential SMEs to suitable global partners. This study primarily sets out to assess and enhance this instrument and to compare the success/failure factors of SMEs against SME categorization and ethnicity. An exploratory study by means of focus groups was first undertaken and as a result, non-compliance was included in this study. 'Innovation', another critical dimension to business success, was also incorporated into the framework. Using a <b>stratified</b> <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> method, 503 SMEs were administered the survey instrument. Data analyses uncovered several key findings. Bumiputera SMEs had better educational background than their non-Bumiputeras counterparts, they claimed to work longer hours, and they rated themselves as having higher positive entrepreneurial traits but their returns (both on revenue and profits) were lower, indicating inefficiency and ineffectiveness in running the retail businesses. All capabilities contributed to the retail SMEs success led by innovation (fi = 0. 362), marketing (fi = 0. 310), and operations management (fi = 0. 310), while non-compliance, proved to be detrimental (fi = - 0. 195).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to analyze the differences in stated housing preferences and norms among farm, rural-nonfarm, and small-town households with some assurance that the differences, if any, are not produced by systematic measurement error. The theoretical basis of the research is the housing adjustment model (Morris and Winter, 1978) but the specific form of the analysis is different because the purpose is focused on measurement. The housing adjustment model {{is based on the}} idea that norms and preferences influence housing behavior and thereby housing conditions. The measurement-error model, in contrast, is {{based on the idea that}} apparent differences among groups in housing preferences and norms may be produced by correctable systematic reporting error;The data used in this analysis were gathered in personal interviews by the Iowa State University Statistical Laboratory during 1985. A multi-stage <b>stratified</b> <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> procedure was utilized, and 506 usable interviews were collected;The analysis involves evaluating three sets of models using logit analysis: (1) one equation with current tenure and structure conditions as the dependent variable, (2) two equations with tenure and with tenure and structure norms as the dependent variable. The models are nested within these sets, which permits statistical comparison of the models in a set. The independent variables in the models are age of the household head, education of the household head, type of household, total household income, background of the household head, residential typology, and size of the household;Age of the household head and type of household have statistically significant effects in the model with housing conditions as the dependent variable. Current housing conditions have the greatest effect of all variables when housing preference is the dependent variable, type of household and residential typology are also statistically significant.

Its main objective is {{to improve the quality of}} the data needed for planning the agricultural sector in the country. This Project has been trying to establish an efficient data collection system based upon an <b>stratified</b> <b>area</b> <b>sample</b> design. The frame from where the sample is selected was constructed according to a land use stratification methodology, which subdivided the frame into count units and segments (sample unit), with the use of visual interpretation techniques, data analysis and cartographic documentation. Because of its versatility the <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> frame is considered basic for the selection of sample of segments. Its main objective is to simplify the process of determination the sample units, allowing that the investigation of the sample data be done in a very efficient way, increasing the precision of its results. The survey which has been carried on since] 987, includes the Distrito Federal and the States of Paraná, Santa Catarina and São Paulo. Because it was the last work done, the sampling frame constructed for the State of São Paulo incorporated all of the methodological experience acquired on this period and that's was the reason for choosing for presentation. Among others changes it is possible to emphasize that for the first time it was treated separately big fields from small ones in the agricultural strata with the aim of enhancing the farming structuring. Ali of the stratification work was done in a municipal basis and because of that the data collection supervisors were asked to draw on municipios maps the spacial distribution of crops in each particular area of work. Appart from that field trips for data checking were done with the objective of identifying spectral signatures on sattelite images, scale 1 : 100. 000, color composition, channels 3, 4 and 5 with blue, green and red filters, respectively. With this methodology it was possible to define the strata according to the intensity use of the agriculture, pasture or forest land. The field work consisted on the investigation of 658 sample segments, with the sample allocated to the strata according to probability proportion to the size of the stratum (number of segments). The principIes variables investigated during the two years where the survey was carried on were: planted area; to be planted and harvested area, including the obtained and expected yield for 13 principal crops in the State of São Paulo.

A devastating earthquake with a magnitude of 6. 3 on the Richter scale destroyed the city of Bam in Kerman Province, Iran. Twenty-six thousand people were killed. Many of the survivors should have developed psychological problems {{in the aftermath of the}} disaster. In this study, we examined the prevalence of complicated grief and its correlation with the demographic factors and some suggested contributing variables. In this cross-sectional study, 400 persons were selected by <b>stratified</b> multistage <b>area</b> <b>sampling.</b> The survivors were interviewed in their temporary residential camp. After evaluating their demographic data, they were evaluated with the inventory of complicated grief. The cut-off point was set to 25. The mean±SD age of the participants was 37. 8 ± 12. 7 years. Complicated grief was detected in 304 (76 %) of the respondents. Score of complicated grief was higher among women and in those with lower educational levels. Presence in the city during the earthquake, observing burial of corpses, destruction of residential homes during the earthquake, residential problem after the catastrophe, and loss of at least one of the first relatives during previous earthquakes were variables which were correlated with the complicated grief. Existence of complicated grief in more than two-thirds of respondents requires more attention of mental health services.

40|$|During {{the last}} 25 years {{different}} programs for detailed landscape surveys based on <b>stratified</b> <b>area</b> covering <b>sampling</b> in landscape grids of ¼ to 4 km 2 {{have been carried}} out in a number of European countries with slightly different methodologies and perspectives, developing towards permanent landscape monitoring systems. In the intensively used Danish agricultural landscape it has been natural to concentrate on the dynamics of small biotopes. An area covering landscape monitoring program with emphasis on small biotopes (SBMP) has developed since 1981, and a continuation of this monitoring within the NOVANA program is planned for the future. During the last many years these different national landscape surveys have cooperated to develop a European platform for consistent landscape related habitat recording and monitoring. This has been realized through the EU BioHab concerted action in the preparation of a common European Field Monitoring Handbook as a user-friendly tool in support of implementing the Habitat Directive, including NATURA 2000, and linking scientific and policy-oriented European projects. The overall European monitoring role of the BioHab framework is to establish a landscape-based connection between the remote sensing-based monitoring of the environment and the site-specific indicators of biodiversity. The landscape-based framework permits a methodology for an operational monitoring that can serve as an early warning system, relating changes in biodiversity to changes in land cover and habitat composition and quality. The focus on essential features of the habitat that can be expressed easily and quantitatively for identification and mapping of small but significant changes at a landscape level has resulted in the reintroduction of Raunkiaers plant life form concept from 1907 as an essential approach in the BioHab project, since plant life forms to a high degree define the structure of the habitat and thereby the habitat’s quality for the species assemblage. Although plant life form has only partly been included in the Small Biotope Monitoring Program (through the registration of agricultural land use, general land cover and tree and shrub cover of small biotopes), it has not been difficult to integrate the BioHab framework in the SBMP-monitoring system, thus permitting the monitoring system to deliver an additional important European perspective with only very limited extra resources involved...|$|R
40|$|While {{studies have}} focused {{exclusively}} on explicating the beneficial effects of volunteer work, {{little is known about}} whether social selection processes also influence the relationship between volunteering and health at different stages of the adulthood. Given the fact that people experience numerous life transitions over the life course, their social engagement and personal well-being are likely to be affected. Scarce research has explored whether stressful life event such as widowhood influences subsequent volunteer participation, and whether volunteering mitigates the negative impact of widowhood on well-being. ^ This research uses 3 -wave panel data from the Americans 2 ̆ 7 Changing Lives study to examine these broad aspects in the relationship between volunteer work and health. This is a multistage <b>stratified</b> <b>area</b> probability <b>sample</b> of persons 24 years of age or older who lived in the continental United States. The baseline data were collected in 1986 (N = 3, 617) and include an over-sample of Black adults (n = 1, 174) and persons 60 years of age or older (n = 1, 669). The analyses entail three interrelated but distinct projects. ^ The first project addresses whether social benefit and selection processes exist in the relationship between volunteer work and depressive symptoms in later life. The results show that formal volunteering exerts a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms are also associated with a subsequent increase in formal volunteer work (compensation effect). Functional impairment—-not depressive symptoms—emerged as an important barrier to volunteer participation. ^ Project two extends the first project by examining the relationship among formal volunteering, depressive symptoms, and functional limitations over middle and late adulthood. The health benefits of volunteering are evident in the sample of older adults. While functional limitations are a barrier to volunteering in later life, depressive symptoms appear to be a barrier to volunteering in middle age. Depressive symptoms increase volunteer participation over time among older adults. ^ The last project investigates the impacts of widowhood on volunteering and well-being in later life. The analyses show that widowhood increases subsequent volunteer participation. Widowhood exacerbates depressive symptoms and self-efficacy over time, but volunteering moderates these negative effects. The time elapsed since widowhood also influences psychosocial adjustments to spousal loss. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{suitable}} area accuracy assessment {{scheme for}} change detection is presented. The technique {{consists of two}} parts which are the necessary stages of accuracy assessment:(1) sampling method and (2) accuracy assessment. A <b>area</b> <b>stratified</b> random <b>sampling</b> is applied {{based on the fact}} that area errors is related to a certain area range (called stratum in following sampling). The approach involves subdividing the area range into strata,and within each stratum a spectific number of sample polygons are randomly chosen. Three experiments about polygons of remote sensing monitoring have been done which aim at finding out the distribution law of area error,the conclusions that the error of polygon area follows normal distribution and the mean is zero are drawed. This give accuracy assessment of remote sensing-derived change detection a science foundation. Based on relative error theory and error spread law,three area accuracy indices including relative root mean square,relative error,and average relative error are built. Using these indices,the formulas of single polygon error and the whole monitoring region error are produced. Experimental results and practical work show that the method in this paper is simple, effective and applicable. 1. 1 General Instruction...|$|R

There is a lack of knowledge regarding the magnitude of community type when examining the relation between subjective health and SES. Methods: Cross-sectional questionnaire data gathered in the spring of 2002 for a prospective follow-up of community interventions were used. These data, together with a number of clinical and laboratory measurements, yielded the baseline for a 10 -year community intervention study. A representative <b>stratified</b> (age, gender, <b>area)</b> <b>sample</b> of men and women living in the province and belonging to the birth cohorts 1926 – 1930, 1936 – 1940, and 1946 – 1950 was obtained from the National Population Registry. The target sample was 4, 272, with 2, 815 persons responding (66 % response rate). Results: Positive associations between indicators of SES and self-rated health were observed in all three community types. After adjusting for other factors, adequacy of income showed the strongest (positive) association with self-rated health in urban areas in all age groups. A similar pattern of associations, with varying statistical significance, though, was found in the two rural areas. Conclusions: This study supports the view that while actual income is positively correlated to health, adequacy of income is an even stronger predictor of it. Thus, there was a significant link between better financial standing and good health among ageing people, especially in urban areas.

The bottom mixed layer remains nutrient-rich, due to regeneration processes. When the thermocline is within the euphotic zone, primary production at thermocline depth is possible as organisms can access nutrients from the bottom layer. Ship-based observations indicate that production within these deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) can form {{a substantial part of}} the annual production, but this process is not captured by satellite observations. The spatial and temporal behaviour of DCM-related production is therefore less well known. To study the extent of DCM occurrence we applied a fully three dimensional, hydro-biogeochemical model to the North Sea.

The <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> frame construction process is the largest operational application. <b>Area</b> <b>sampling</b> frames remain as the statistical foundation of many U. S. probability based agricultural surveys, since area frames have complete frame coverage and no duplication of land areas. NASS has been utilizing <b>area</b> frame <b>sampling</b> since 1954 and nationwide since 1965. The land area of the country (state by state in the U. S.) is divided into broad land use or land cover strata. From 1954 to 1978 aerial photography was the primary source of information for this stratification. From 1978 to the present, Landsat image products have been the main source of stratification information. In 1988, NASS started a joint research effort with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to convert the stratification process from a basically manual image interpretation proces...|$|R
