5000|$|The Laredo {{served as}} the base Grand Cherokee trim level from 1999 to 2004, and still {{continues}} to be the base Grand Cherokee trim level to this day. A very well-equipped model, the Laredo offered these features as standard equipment: the 4.0L Power-Tech Inline Six-Cylinder (I6) engine, a 4-speed automatic transmission, sixteen-inch (16") alloy wheels, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette and CD player (1999-2001) or CD players (2002-2004), wood interior trim (1999-2000) or aluminum interior trim (2001-2004), keyless entry, power windows and door locks, cloth seating surfaces, air conditioning, a split-folding 60/40 rear bench seat, gray-painted front and rear bumpers and body-side cladding trim panels, and more. After 1999, the Laredo 26D Package was dropped, leaving the Laredo 26E/28E Packages as the base Grand Cherokee packages, and adding a standard overhead Electronic Vehicle Information Center (EVIC/VIC) and overhead console. Many features that were available on the luxurious Limited trim could also be optioned on the base Laredo trim. For 2001 only, a New England Special Group was available for Grand Cherokees equipped with the 26E Package. The package, which was indicated by the <b>sales</b> <b>code</b> ACJ, added features to the base model Grand Cherokee such as P235/65R17 BSW all-season performance tires, seventeen-inch (17") sport alloy wheels (both options of which were also available with the 26S and 28S Packages, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette and CD players with integrated remote CD changer controls, and a 3.73 rear axle ratio.

5000|$|Production {{was moved}} from the St. Louis, Missouri plant to the Sterling Heights, Michigan plant. This second Daytona {{restyling}} replaced the pop-up headlights with flush-mounted rounded ones, along with a new grille and rear fascia. Window surround moldings on the doors were also new, and rounder than the sharper angles of moldings on the 1984 to 1991 models. The new model also displayed the new Dodge rams head emblem on the hood and below the read light. While 6-cylinder power became an option on lower end models, the 3.0 L Mitsubishi V6 was the standard engine on IROC models. Optional on the 1992 IROC was the 2.5l [...] "High Torque" [...] Turbo, available as a very rare option (less than 230 produced). Also available on IROC was the new [...] R/T performance package, which featured a [...] Turbo III version of the 2.2 L 4-cylinder, but with a Lotus designed DOHC cylinder head and direct ignition system instead of a distributor-type ignition system. Although the Shelby trim was discontinued in 1991 (due {{to the end of}} Shelbys involvement with Chrysler), a small number of 1992 Daytona IROCs were produced bearing the Shelby name. These IROCs featured [...] "Shelby" [...] decals, and were all 2.5 Turbo cars, as they featured the Shelby Performance Package <b>sales</b> <b>code.</b> These rare Shelby versions were mainly [...] "Chrysler" [...] branded Daytonas, and were part of an early run of IROCs. These were the last production vehicles produced by Chrysler Corp to bear the Shelby name. Production of the Daytona ended in February 1993 without an immediate replacement. The 1995 Dodge Avenger eventually took the Daytonas place. Today the Dodge Daytona, along with many other turbocharged Chrysler vehicles, has developed a sort of cult following, remaining popular among its own group of followers because of its durable engine, which can be easily modified to put out large quantities of power at relatively low cost and ease.|$|E
40|$|THESIS 8524 This thesis explores {{two issues}} in {{medicinal}} product defect litigation. The first issue {{relates to the}} difficulty that people have in suing pharmaceutical companies for medicinal product defects. The second issue involves {{one of the great}} imponderables of modem product liability law, which is whether product liability law should be based on negligence or strict liability. In determining these two issues, the methodology of research includes examination of national cases and statute law with the aim of determining the effect these forms of law have on the two questions the thesis poses. Because of the lack of cases relating to medicinal product defects in Europe, reference is made to the extensive pharmaceutical case law that has been developed in America. There has been considerable academic research in this area of the law in the United States and the resulting papers have been consulted widely to support tlie analyses contained in the thesis. The first issue relates to the difficulty that people, injured by defective medicinal products, have in taking legal action against pharmaceutical companies. It is found that the sale of goods legislation does not provide a satisfactory redress for consumers who have been injured by medicinal product design defects. A separate consumer <b>sales</b> <b>code</b> is proposed which should only concern itself with repair and replacement of defective products. When medicinal products are not safe, recourse should only be to negligence and strict liability as envisaged under the Liability for Defective Products Act 1991...|$|E

No disrupted terrain features are observed antipodal to the Isidis or Argyre basins, although some of the old fractures in Noctis Labyrinthus could have originated in response to the Isidis impact, and later have been reactivated by the Tharsis tectonics assumed to have produced Noctis.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} mortgage defaults in Southern California during the housing bubble of the 2000 s. The rapid {{decline in the}} housing market that precipitated the current recession has been accompanied by an unprecedented number of loan defaults and foreclosures. Recent studies have identified two major theories of default [...] the 2 ̆ 2 double trigger 2 ̆ 2 hypothesis, where negative equity and an income shock are necessary conditions for default [...] and 2 ̆ 2 strategic default 2 ̆ 2 where negative equity is a sufficient condition for default. This paper adds to the default literature by adding short sale as another possible outcome of mortgage default. The primary goal is to analyze the determinants of mortgage default to assist in understanding the conditions under which strategic behavior of home sales is most likely to occur. Data from Los Angeles County was analyzed from 2007 to 2010 for every closed <b>sale,</b> then <b>coded</b> into three possible sales outcomes: 1) Organic 2) Short Sale 3) Real Estate Owned (REO). A multinomial probit model was used to model homeowner decision-making based on the sale outcome. The model rejected the 2 ̆ 2 double trigger 2 ̆ 2 hypothesis, as it was found that income shocks do no {{have a significant effect on}} impacting the predicted probability for distressed sales. Education levels, the sales price of homes, credit card debt, and market price reductions were found to be significant variables in determining distressed sales outcomes, thereby confirming the strategic default hypothesis. The next section studied spatial association of short sales and REO to see if any contagion effects were present. It was found that both short sales and REO form into clusters of hot and cold spots. Social stigma is believed to impact consumer behavior, the theory was confirmed through the findings of contagion and spatial lag. The final section constructed a hedonic price model to capture the price effects that distressed sales have on neighborhood pricing. Foreclosures were found to have three times the negative impact on neighborhood pricing compared to short sales...|$|R

One source of neighborhood data includes commercial databases integrated with geographic information systems to measure availability of certain types of businesses or destinations that may have either favorable or adverse effects on health outcomes; however, the quality of these data sources is generally unknown. This study assessed the concordance of two commercial databases for ascertaining the presence, locations, and characteristics of businesses. Businesses in the St. Louis, Missouri area were selected based on their four-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes and classified into 14 business categories. Business listings in the two commercial databases were matched by standardized business name within specified distances. Concordance and coverage measures were calculated using capture–recapture methods for all businesses and by business type, with further stratification by census-tract-level population density, percent below poverty, and racial composition. For matched listings, distance between listings and agreement in four-digit SIC <b>code,</b> <b>sales</b> volume, and employee size were calculated. Overall, the percent agreement was 32 % between the databases. Concordance and coverage estimates were lowest for health-care facilities and leisure/entertainment businesses; highest for popular walking destinations, eating places, and alcohol/tobacco establishments; and varied somewhat by population density. The mean distance (SD) between matched listings was 108. 2 (179. 0) m with varying levels of agreement in four-digit SIC (percent agreement[*]=[*] 84. 6 %), employee size (weighted kappa[*]=[*] 0. 63), and sales volume (weighted kappa[*]=[*] 0. 04).

40|$|Distributed {{run-time}} code {{generation is}} a useful technique that can easily be implemented using the technique known as ``compositional semantics. '' In this dissertation, we describe a new system, Jumbo, which adds run-time code generation features to Java. Its design allows code generators from disparate sources to be combined dynamically. Jumbo {{can be used to}} create highly adaptable code that can be distributed in binary form. In order to handle the increasing complexity of software, programmers have long been creating reusable function libraries. These libraries can be distributed in binary form, allowing distribution that does not reveal implementation secrets. While libraries allow sharing or <b>sale</b> of <b>code</b> fragments, the granularity and inflexibility of pre-compiled functions force the libraries to be either overly general or prohibitively specific. Run-time code generation systems present a light-weight alternative to function calls, where fragments of code, not necessarily in the form of whole functions, can be manipulated in order to create higher-quality specialized code. However, the currently existing run-time code generation systems either operate at the source level or take a non-compositional approach, and thus are not amenable to binary distribution. Jumbo implements a novel form of run-time compilation, where code fragments in binary form from several sources can be combined at run time to form efficient specialized code. By basing Jumbo on compositional semantics, we avoid the monolithic nature of traditional code generation systems. A distributed run-time code generation system allows some previously unknown functionality. For instance, in database systems, a client can create query functions that interact directly with the servers internal calls without either the query or the database implementation needing to be disclosed. Render farms can allow clients to specify textures with code that is merged with local, specialized functions, without disclosing their texture details. Anonymity, copyrights and trade secrets can be retained without sacrificing efficiency. Jumbo is also useful for non-distributed systems that can take advantage of staged compilation for efficiency. We show several examples of how Jumbo can be used simply as an optimization tool, allowing user-controlled and domain-specific optimizations. Jumbo can additionally be used {{in a manner similar to}} that of macros, providing a way to codify common programming practices. We also consider the question of optimizing the code generators and the generated code, and present a rewriting system for Java abstract syntax trees designed to optimize the code generators. This general-purpose optmizer exploits the compositional nature of Jumbo to make aggressive optimizations on the code generators for the individual code fragments...|$|R
40|$|Selection {{objectives}} and criteria were defined and appraised {{for a simple}} production system involving a New Zealand Romney breeding flock under North Island hill country conditions, in which all surplus offspring are sold as lambs. Through the availability of New Zealand Wool Board auction data for the seasons 1976 / 77 to 1980 / 81, the influence of wool quality traits on price was analysed by regression techniques. Traits examined included mean fibre diameter (MFD), style(S), mean length (ML) and yield (Y). For the 1980 / 81 season only, further data from the <b>Coded</b> <b>Sales</b> Assistance Report (C. S. A. R.) was available for scouring indicator (SI), colour indicator (CI), felted (F), pen stain (P), cotted (Co), tender (T), mixed length (LV) and mixed quality (QV). In addition, the effects on price of three non-fleece variables, lot weight (LW), mode of offering (MO) and New Zealand Wool Board market intervention policies (Int), were considered. Y was shown {{to have a major}} influence over greasy price. The relationship between price and ML was confirmed as being non-linear, with ML having a greater effect on the price of shorter wools. S and MFD were less influential. The control these four traits jointly exerted over greasy price ranged up to 74. 0 %, which was further enhanced by the introduction of quadratic terms. ML 2 was the most important quadratic term. The inclusion of the C. S. A. R. and non-fleece related traits, failed to provide any further control over price. CI proved to be an effective substitute for S. Selection objectives were defined for greasy and clean wool, combined with short, long and mixed length categories. Economic weights for wool quality traits were directly calculated from the regression of auction price on the level of the traits. Economic weights for number of lambs weaned (NLW), weaning weight (WW), ewe body weight (EBW), greasy fleece weight (GFW) and clean fleece weight (CFW) were calculated using the marginal profit method. The relativities between the calculated economic weights were generally in good agreement with those of previously published estimates. For the selection objectives defined, various selection criteria were appraised. These included the traits in the selection objective, or their respective criteria, as well as hogget body weight (HBW), quality number (QN) and fleece character grade (CHG). NLW (dam), HBW and HGFW were of major importance in the selection index. The remaining traits were of only minimal value. On the basis of cost of measurement and value within the index, the full index was converted to a reduced index of NLW (dam), HBW and HGFW. In terms of accuracy of prediction and economy, this index was considered suitable for most commercial conditions. Further reduced indices were computed which generated less overall genetic gain, but which individual breeders may consider more appropriate to their particular requirements. Sensitivity analyses for HBW, NLW, GFW (CFW) and SC generally produced few changes of any consequence to the selection indices. Restriction of all genetic change in EBW significantly reduced the expected overall genetic gain...|$|R
