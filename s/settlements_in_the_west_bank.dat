The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, the International Court of Justice, and the International Committee of the Red Cross {{refer to it}} as Occupied Palestinian Territory. The area and population of Jerusalem includes that of East Jerusalem which has been de facto annexed by Israel and incorporated within Jerusalem's municipal borders under the Jerusalem Law. This, however, is not recognized by the international community who regard East Jerusalem as part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.|$|E
5|$|With little {{mathematical}} hope {{of winning}} the nomination and polls showing another likely defeat in the New York primary, Kennedy prepared {{to withdraw from the}} race. However, partially due to Jewish voter unhappiness with a U.S. vote at the United Nations against Israeli <b>settlements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank,</b> Kennedy staged an upset and won the March 25 vote by a 59–41 percent margin. Carter responded with an advertising campaign that attacked Kennedy's character in general without explicitly mentioning Chappaquiddick, but Kennedy still managed a narrow win in the April 22 Pennsylvania primary. Carter won 11 of 12 primaries held in May, while on the June 3 Super Tuesday primaries, Kennedy won California, New Jersey, and three smaller states out of eight contests. Overall, Kennedy had won 10 presidential primaries against Carter, who won 24.|$|E

Due to hyperinflation, in 1982 and 1984 Israel issued non-denominated stamps. During the 1990s, Israel experimented with vending machines for postal labels (franking labels).|$|E
25|$|Peretz saw an {{intrinsic}} connection between {{a solution to}} the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the resolving of Israel's internal social tensions. He argued that the resources allotted to the <b>settlements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> had diverted funds that could have helped to solve social problems throughout Israel. He described the conflict as having mutated Israeli politics, so that the traditional left-right distinctions did not hold. Instead of supporting a social-democratic left that would advance their cause, the lower classes, mostly of Middle Eastern Jewish origins, were diverted to the right by the fanning of nationalist tendencies. Concurrently, the left in Israel was usurped by the well-to-do, so that the Labor party had ironically become elitist. Peretz also backed direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian movement Hamas.|$|E

25|$|In a video titled “The Truth About the West Bank” {{released}} by the Israeli foreign ministry in June 2011, Ayalon presents a historical narrative meant to help wage the public diplomacy battle about Israel’s ongoing conflict with the Palestinians. In the video made in cooperation with StandWithUs, which {{is very similar to}} one released earlier by the Yesha council, the organization of the Jewish <b>settlements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank,</b> Ayalon asks viewers to stop referring to the West Bank as “occupied territories”. “It is time for Israel to return to a ‘rights-based diplomacy’ and talk about the facts, rights, history and international law which are little known but give a dramatically different viewpoint to what is currently accepted,” he said after the video’s release. After the video was posted online, Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian Authority’s top negotiator, denounced the video as a “falsified account of history and international law”, but refused to participate in a public debate on the issues raised in the video proposed by Ayalon.|$|E
25|$|Begin’s most {{significant}} achievement as Prime Minister was {{the signing of}} a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, for which he and Anwar Sadat shared the Nobel Prize for Peace. In {{the wake of the}} Camp David Accords, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula, which was captured from Egypt in the Six-Day War. Later, Begin’s government promoted the construction of Israeli <b>settlements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> and the Gaza Strip. Begin authorized the bombing of the Osirak nuclear plant in Iraq and the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to fight PLO strongholds there, igniting the 1982 Lebanon War. As Israeli military involvement in Lebanon deepened, and the Sabra and Shatila massacre, carried out by Christian Phalangist militia allies of the Israelis, shocked world public opinion, Begin grew increasingly isolated. As IDF forces remained mired in Lebanon and the economy suffered from hyperinflation, the public pressure on Begin mounted. Depressed by the death of his wife Aliza in November 1982, he gradually withdrew from public life, until his resignation in October 1983.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 2014, Maariv {{reported}} that Israeli and American leaders had been discussing, and seriously considering, {{the possibility of}} ceding parts of the Arab Triangle to the Palestinians in exchange for Jewish <b>settlements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank.</b> The residents of the Triangle would automatically become Palestinian citizens if this happened. This idea {{is similar to the}} Lieberman Plan. Rami Hamdallah also said that despite Erekat's insistence that the talks had failed, the Palestinians would continue participating in the talks until the April deadline. On 5 January, hardliners in Netanyahu's coalition threatened to withdraw from the government if he accepted the 1967 borders as a baseline for talks. Dovish opposition parties, such as Labor, have said they would join if this occurs, in order to prevent the coalition from breaking up completely. On 9 January, according to insiders, support for a two-state agreement within the Knesset stood at 85 in favor to 35 opposed. In addition to the Labor Party, American negotiators were also attempting to persuade Haredi parties Shas and United Torah Judaism, both of which are generally supportive of the peace process, to join the government to keep negotiations alive.|$|E
