Soon she becomes frightened after Tigerstar discusses his plans to rule the forest with his Clanmates, including hiring BloodClan and setting a pack of dogs on ThunderClan. Extremely scared and changing her mind, Sasha flees, but before she can get far she is approached by Tigerstar who asks if she will join ShadowClan.|$|E

5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} conceptions of {{morality}} and ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe {{as a part of}} moral discourse. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> at the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts such as that of the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> {{down upon}} the ledge, and then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> below it to the water, which was idly {{flapping}} {{against the side of}} the vessel.|$|R
60|$|She {{waited a}} moment, {{after he had}} said that. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> at her mother, and sighed. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> back again at Mr. Godfrey, and went on.|$|R

5|$|Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother.

5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If you saw her in the street, you'd think: <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> like a girl who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E
60|$|Priscilla stood {{quiet for}} a minute. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> over the crowd, and then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at the poor Hof-rath, who now began {{to show that he}} was a little frightened.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> {{properly}} surprised, {{and this}} was just how they had hoped <b>she</b> would <b>look.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Doesn't <b>she</b> <b>look</b> like Rubens' second wife?" [...] cried Athelny. [...] "Wouldn't <b>she</b> <b>look</b> splendid in a seventeenth-century costume? That's {{the sort}} of wife to marry, my boy. Look at her." ...|$|R
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Peter Rosenthal, begins with Madonna entering a park. After meeting {{two children and}} a teenage boy, they start roaming around the park, with Madonna singing the song. These scenes are interchanged with scenes from the motion picture, which show Madonna as the movie character Nikki Fynn. As the music video progresses, Madonna is shown to be {{in search of an}} Egyptian treasure casket. After being directed to it by a version of the High Priestess tarot card displaying her cartoon impersonation, Madonna opens it to find a huge diamond. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> up happily to the children. The video ends with them continuing dancing and Madonna carrying away the casket.|$|E
5|$|When Buffy is on patrol, she laments in {{song about}} how uninspired her life has become ("Going Through the Motions"). The {{next morning at}} the Magic Box, the gang reveal that they also sang that evening. Led by Giles, the gang theorizes about {{the cause of the}} singing; they sense no {{immediate}} danger but agreeing that by working together they can overcome anything ("I've Got a Theory/Bunnies/If We're Together"). Buffy learns that the whole town is affected when <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> outside the shop to see a large group (led by series writer and producer David Fury) singing and dancing about how a dry-cleaning service got their stains out ("The Mustard").|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
60|$|And {{now with}} {{gathering}} and darkening emotion, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> as <b>she</b> had <b>looked</b> when Florence entered.|$|R
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> sad, and he {{knew why}} <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> sad. One of her arms moved as if it wanted to go round something, {{and he knew}} what it wanted to go round.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just look at this, Mrs. Maze," [...] said Gaites {{when she}} drew {{near enough to}} read the address on the piano-case. <b>She</b> did <b>look</b> at it; then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at Gaites's face, into which he had thrown a sort of stony calm; and then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> back at the piano-case.|$|R
5|$|Tom (Aziz Ansari) is {{tasked with}} taking the cover {{photo of the}} summer catalog, and convinces Ann (Rashida Jones) and Mark (Paul Schneider) to pose for photos at a {{community}} park. Tom is repeatedly frustrated with Ann, who has a difficult time appearing happy. When the photos are finished, Ann agrees that <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> miserable and asks that the pictures not be used. Mark appears concerned that Ann's unhappiness {{is a reflection of}} their relationship. She insists everything is fine, but he is unconvinced. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) appear to be growing closer. After helping Leslie set up her picnic, Andy asks whether April wants to get drinks after work, and she agrees. However, when they arrive at a bar, the bouncer (Mike Mauloff) easily notices April is underage, and her identification confirms she is 20. April tells Andy they can go to another bar, but Andy decides to go home instead, seemingly uncomfortable about their age difference. April is visibly disappointed, but does not convey it to Andy. Later, the summer catalogs arrive, with a photo on the cover of April and Andy appearing happy together at the picnic.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is invited}} by her boss Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to spend Christmas {{with him to}} help him deal with a visit from his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). Liz finds it strange that Jack's fiancée Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) will not spend the holiday with him and {{immediately}} realizes that Jack has not told his mother about Avery's pregnancy. Avery becomes angry, but she and Liz convince him to tell her which he promises to do. Jack tells Colleen about the news {{but she is not}} excited about the pregnancy as Jack and Avery are not married. To get back at her, Jack calls his biological father Milton Greene (Alan Alda), the father she never told him he had, and invites him to spend Christmas with him, and does not inform him that Colleen will be present. The next day, Milton arrives and Jack explains the reason for his visit is so that he can ambush Colleen as <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> down on his relationship with Avery.

In Reno, they take ecstasy and almost have sex before Mercer resumes his search for Arlen. Later he finds himself on the set of a pornographic film, where the {{director}} (Julio Oscar Mechoso) tells him that Arlen left to work at a pet store in Sacramento, California. Joely asks Mercer if he can drive her cousin Buddy (Colin Fickes) and his friend Rid (William Lee Scott) to Mojave, California, where they are building their own car.

6000|$|... "I saw her! The consoler of sleepless nights, of weary days; the {{companion}} of troubled years! I saw her! <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> {{straight at the}} place where I crouched. She was there as I had seen her for years--a faithful wanderer by my side. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> with sad eyes and had smiling lips; <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at me [...] . Smiling lips! Had I not promised that she should not die! ...|$|R
