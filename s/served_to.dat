Tamar hind, originally from Africa is a liquorice drink made by soaking or infusing liquorice sticks, and adding lemon juice. Qamar deen is traditionally <b>served</b> <b>to</b> break the Ramadan fast (as is water), and is an iced drink made from a dry sheet of apricots soaked in water, and mixed with lemon juice or syrup.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Kinesiology (Sport Performance)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012 Volleyball {{coaches and}} players go at great lengths to find {{competitive}} advantages against opponents. Many hours are spent practicing, studying game films, and strategizing {{in the hopes of}} finding valuable predictors of success. 	It is widely accepted that the primary predictor of team success lies in players ability <b>to</b> both <b>serve</b> effectively and receive serve effectively (McGown, Fronske, & Moser 2001; Papageorgiou & Spitzley 2003). Thus, it is imperative that players and coaches are aware of the best <b>serving</b> strategies <b>to</b> utilize {{during the course of a}} match. 	Though many studies have attempted <b>to</b> investigate <b>serve</b> success predictors such as mode of serves, force of serves, and rotational velocity of serves, there is a lack of research that identifies the success rates of <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> various locations on the court. 	This study investigated the success levels of <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> zones 1, 5, and 6. A total of 120 <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> each zone (total n= 360) were quality analyzed using a 0 - 3 scale (USA Volleyball, 2009). The results were then compared using an analysis of variance (p= 0. 05) to determine if there were significant differences among the means. It was found that <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> zone 6 (m= 2. 34) were received significantly easier than <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> zone 1 (m= 2. 11). Additionally, it was found that <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> zone 1 were received at a significantly lower percentage than <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> zones 5 and 6. Kinesiology (Sport Performance...|$|R
