5000|$|The sight-word (Whole Word) {{method was}} invented by Rev. Thomas H. Gallaudet, the {{director}} of the American Asylum at Hartford in the 1830s. It was designed for the education of the Deaf by juxtaposing a word, with a picture. In 1830, Gallaudet provided a description of his method to the American Annals of Education which included teaching children to recognize a total of 50 sight words written on cards and by 1837 the method was adopted by the Boston Primary School Committee. Horace Mann the then Secretary of the Board of Education of Massachusetts, USA favored the method and it soon became the dominant method statewide. By 1844 the defects of the new method became so apparent to Boston schoolmasters that they issued an attack against it urging a return to an intensive, systematic phonics.

The distribution of a well-studied species, the humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae was mapped and analyzed in relation to remotely sensed data on ocean depth, sea surface temperature, sea surface height, wind speed, chlorophyll-A, and surface currents. The results agreed with previous research on humpback whales, indicating that acoustic surveys from vessels of opportunity are a viable method for collecting distribution data on cetaceans. The predicted species of odontocete whistles collected during vessel of opportunity surveys was determined using the Real-time Odontocete Call Classification Algorithm, and analyzed in respect to remotely sensed data. The sighting rate for odontocete surveys in this study is comparable to that of previous survey methods, and cryptic species are identified at a higher relative rate than when using visual <b>sighting</b> <b>methods.</b> The biases inherent in concentrating survey effort primarily in the calm waters on the leeward sides the Hawaiian Islands are discussed, as well as the drawbacks of relying on visual <b>sighting</b> <b>methods</b> for detecting species with low visual detection probability.

Here {{we present a}} study of the {{peculiar}} afterglow spectrum of the z = 0. 889 Swift GRB[*] 140506 A. Aims. Our aim is to understand the origin of the very unusual properties of the absorption along the line of <b>sight.</b> <b>Methods.</b> We analyse spectroscopic observations obtained with the X-shooter spectrograph mounted on the ESO/VLT at two epochs 8. 8 h and 33 h after the burst, and with imaging from the GROND instrument. We also present imaging and spectroscopy of the host galaxy obtained with the Magellan telescope. Results. The underlying afterglow appears to be a typical afterglow of a long-duration GRB. However, the material along the line of sight has imprinted very unusual features on the spectrum. First, there is a very broad and strong flux drop below 8000 Å (~ 4000 Å in the rest frame), which seems to be variable between the two spectroscopic epochs. We can reproduce the flux-drops both as a giant 2175 Å extinction bump and as an effect of multiple scattering on dust grains in a dense environment. Second, we detect absorption lines from excited H[*]i and He[*]i. We also detect molecular absorption from CH+. Conclusions. We interpret the unusual properties of these spectra as reflecting the presence of three distinct regions along the line of sight: the excited He[*]i absorption originates from an H[*]ii-region, whereas the Balmer absorption must originate from an associated photodissociation region. The strong metal line and molecular absorption and the dust extinction must originate from a third, cooler region along the line of sight. The presence of at least three separate regions is reflected {{in the fact that the}} different absorption components have different velocities relative to the systemic redshift of the host galaxy...|$|R
