The bottles for each of the perfumes are composed of two round parts: the body of the bottle and the ball cap. Tempt, Tease and Touch are packaged in black, pink, and grey bottles respectively. A writer for Cosmeticsbusiness.com attributed the Sugababes' decision to release three separate perfumes with Aspects Beauty Company founder Jill Hill's belief that an increasing investment in [...] "collections of scents instead of one major product" [...] would offer more value and be [...] "a relatively <b>safe</b> <b>bet</b> for brands".|$|E

But Rogan also pays tribute to Morrison's pure, untainted artistry, and details the development – and subsequent decline – of Morrison's muse over the past 40 years or so. For the serious Van-ologist, Rogan's painstaking research yields an abundance of detail about Morrison's early years". Graeme Green of the Daily Express noted that Rogan [...] "concentrates far more on Van the man than it does on his music, with the singer largely portrayed as difficult, selfish and aloof". He noted that Morrison would turn 60 the year the book was published, and commented [...] "When the singer celebrates his landmark birthday this year, it's a <b>safe</b> <b>bet</b> Rogan's name won't be on the invite list." ...|$|E

500|$|After a one-yard Mike Pruitt run, Rutigliano {{called a}} timeout. A short field goal {{would have been}} the <b>safe</b> <b>bet</b> — that was all Cleveland needed to win. Rutigliano, ever the risk-taker, decided to go for a touchdown. The coach was {{reluctant}} to stake the game's outcome on the usually sure-footed Cockroft, who had missed two field goals and an extra point earlier in the game. The play he called was Red Right 88, a passing formation in which a slanting Logan would be Sipe's primary target, while Newsome was insurance. If everyone was covered, Rutigliano told Sipe on the sidelines, [...] "if you feel you have to force the ball, throw it into Lake Erie, throw it into some blonde's lap in the bleachers." [...] Sipe took the snap, dropped back and threw to Newsome as he crossed to the left. But Oakland safety Mike Davis leaped in front and intercepted the ball, cementing the Oakland win. The Raiders went on to win Super Bowl XV, while Red Right 88 became an enduring symbol of Cleveland's postseason stumbles.|$|E

Handlen both criticized Griffin's inability to portray two separate characters, as well as Carter's failure at writing a comedic script. He also felt that the [...] "relentless self-awareness isn’t amusing anymore". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a scathing review. He wrote [...] "If it is indeed true that somewhere out in this vast world we all have an identical twin, I have but one wish for mine. I sincerely hope he was spared the hour of torture that 'Fight Club' imposed upon me." [...] Christina Brzustoski from 11th Hour Magazine opined that [...] "Just when you thought The X-Files couldn't get a more grating guest star than Victoria Jackson, Chris Carter manages to top himself yet again with not one, but two, {{for the love of}} God, two Kathy Griffins in the Carter-penned episode 'Fight Club.' It's a <b>safe</b> <b>bet</b> this disjointed, lame episode will probably not be easily confused with the far superior David Fincher movie of the same name.

[...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer Clark Collis wrote that the album's title [...] "justifies its name thanks to a chunkier array of riffs and choruses" [...] compared to Where You Want to Be. Sarah Dean wrote on FasterLouder that Louder Now differs from the band's past records; it has [...] "a darker mood, bigger choruses and perhaps even catchier melodies," [...] with the [...] "emo-pop punk flavour Taking Back Sunday are renowned for."
