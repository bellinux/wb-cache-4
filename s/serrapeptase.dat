5000|$|Serratiopeptidase (Serratia E-15 protease, {{also known}} as serralysin, <b>serrapeptase,</b> serratiapeptase, serratia peptidase, serratio peptidase, or serrapeptidase) is a {{proteolytic}} enzyme (protease) produced by enterobacterium Serratia sp. E-15. [...] This microorganism was originally isolated in the late 1960s from silkworm Bombyx mori L. (intestine), [...] Serratiopeptidase {{is present in the}} silkworm intestine and allows the emerging moth to dissolve its cocoon. Serratiopeptase is produced by purification from culture of Serratia E-15 bacteria.|$|E
5000|$|Regular {{breastfeeding}} can be continued. The {{treatment for}} breast engorgement {{can be divided}} into non-medical and medical methods. The non-medical methods include hot/cold packs, Gua-Sha (scraping therapy), acupuncture and cabbage leaves whereas medical methods are proteolytic enzymes such as <b>serrapeptase,</b> protease, and subcutaneous oxytocin. Evidence from published clinical trials on the effectiveness of treatment options is of weak quality and is not strong enough to justify a clinical recommendation.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{news article}} {{published}} Feb 22, 2011, Kyodo News reports: [...] "Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. said Monday it will voluntarily recall an anti-inflammatory drug touted effective {{for a variety}} of conditions ranging from chronic bronchitis to sprained ankles because recent tests have cast doubt on its efficacy even though it has been on the market for more than 40 years.Double-blind experiments comparing the effects of the drug Danzen, which debuted in 1968, and placebos showed {{no significant differences between the}} two, the major drugmaker said.Sales of the product, generically called <b>serrapeptase,</b> totaled ¥6.7 billion in fiscal 2009, but the impact of the recall will likely be limited because similar drugs are being sold on the market, it said.". In a case report it was seen that serratiopeptidase may cause lysis of fibrin wall around an abscess and cause its local spread. So its use sometimes could be harmful in treating abscess.(10) ...|$|E
40|$|Production {{characterization}} of serratiopeptidase (STP) enzyme by Serratia marcescens was {{the aim of}} this study. Serratia marcescens was allowed to grow in Tryptone Yeast Extract Glucose broth culture for the purpose of inducing STP (<b>serrapeptase</b> or serratiopeptidase) enzyme. The optimal conditions for STP production by Serratia marcescens were; 0. 5 % substrate(Gelatin) concentration; 24 h incubation period; 32 ºC incubation temperature and 6. 0 pH; the best buffer for production of STP enzyme was phosphate buffer. The best broth ingredient was tryptone; An optimum carbon sources was glucose; an optimum nitrogen source for STP enzyme production was tryptone; Valine was the best amino acids for the production of STP enzyme; the utilization of organic acids, acetic, citric, lactic acid decreased STP enzyme production at different concentrations above 3. 0 %. The STP enzyme was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis. The enzyme was found to have 52 KDa molecular weight by SDS – PAGE analysis. The STP enzyme activity increased as the increase in enzyme concentration. The data obtained emphasizes the possibility of production and purification of the microbial STP enzyme for application under industrial scale. </p...|$|E
