5|$|The {{magnetosphere}} is {{the region}} above the ionosphere that {{is defined by}} the extent of the Earth's magnetic field in space. It extends several tens of thousands of kilometers into space, protecting the Earth from the charged particles of the solar wind and cosmic rays that would otherwise <b>strip</b> <b>away</b> the upper atmosphere, including the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{magnetic}} field serves to deflect {{most of the}} solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise <b>strip</b> <b>away</b> the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. One stripping mechanism is for gas {{to be caught in}} bubbles of {{magnetic field}}, which are ripped off by solar winds. Calculations of the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars, resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Telopea speciosissima is a pyrogenic-{{flowering}} species, {{relying on}} post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds {{to take advantage}} of favourable growing conditions in the altered environment following a fire. Of the woody resprouter species of southeastern Australia, {{it is one of the}} slowest to produce seedlings after bushfires, taking at least two years. The species resprouts from a lignotuber, a swollen woody base largely under the soil, that stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth of new shoots after a bushfire. Waratahs dominate the understorey around two years after a fire, but are later overtaken by the slower-growing banksias (Banksia) and wattles (Acacia). Fire also serves to <b>strip</b> <b>away</b> diseases and pests. Flowering may be prolific at this time.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{a larger}} planet {{is likely to}} have a large iron core. This allows for a {{magnetic}} field to protect the planet from stellar wind and cosmic radiation, which otherwise would tend to <b>strip</b> <b>away</b> planetary atmosphere and to bombard living things with ionized particles. Mass is not the only criterion for producing a magnetic field—as the planet must also rotate fast enough to produce a dynamo effect within its core—but it is a significant component of the process.|$|E
25|$|The New Deal's record {{came under}} attack by New Left historians in the 1960s for its pusillanimity in not attacking {{capitalism}} more vigorously, nor helping blacks achieve equality. The critics emphasize {{the absence of a}} philosophy of reform to explain the failure of New Dealers to attack fundamental social problems. They demonstrate the New Deal's commitment to save capitalism and its refusal to <b>strip</b> <b>away</b> private property. They detect a remoteness from the people and indifference to participatory democracy, and call instead for more emphasis on conflict and exploitation.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which ethosuximide affects neuronal excitability includes block of T-type calcium channels, and may include effects of the drug on other classes of ion channel. The primary finding that ethosuximide is a T-type calcium channel blocker gained widespread support, but initial attempts to replicate the finding were inconsistent. Subsequent experiments on recombinant T-type channels in cell lines demonstrated conclusively that ethosuximide blocks all T-type calcium channel isoforms. Significant T-type calcium channel density occurs in dendrites of neurons, and recordings from reduced preparations that <b>strip</b> <b>away</b> this dendritic source of T-type calcium channels {{may have contributed to}} reports of ethosuximide ineffectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Froudacity {{is split}} into four books, each {{addressing}} specific topics that Froude brings. Thomas begins the preface by attacking the overarching claims that Froude uses {{to argue against}} self-governance. Thomas ridicules Froude's assertion that if blacks in West Indian countries were given the right to vote, they would elect a candidate that would <b>strip</b> <b>away</b> the rights of whites due to racial animosity. He also attacks the notion that West Indian blacks harbor animosity against whites {{by pointing out that}} as many blacks owned slaves as whites, and that most people who were alive during slavery have since died.|$|E
25|$|The Fauves (many of {{whom would}} become Cubists), were heavily {{influenced}} by Neo-Impressionism, calling upon rational and scientific thought and creating highly abstract visions {{with the goal of}} producing the effects of real color-light. Mechanical brushwork suppressed the personality of the artist in an act of conspicuous defiance against the Impressionists. The Symbolists too would <b>strip</b> <b>away</b> the casual and accidental features of reality, revealing the true 'essence of form.' Whether such a revelation could be backed up by a scientific theory or not, there were still examples that could be codified. The problem was that pigments reflect light, they are not a light source themselves. Colors in the spectra of light did not respond {{in the same way as}} color pigments painted on canvas. For example, red and blue light rays result in white light, but the same colors in pigments make violet.|$|E

25|$|James Anthony Froude, a {{well-known}} English intellectual, was an apologist for imperial rule. In 1886, he published Oceana, {{another one of}} Froude's works attacking the desire for self-rule in Australia. Like English in the West Indies, it was criticized for its superficial coverage of colonial affairs and Froude's lack {{of exposure to the}} native countries which he discussed. His next travelogue, The English in the West Indies, detailed his travels in the West Indies and his political opinions on the benefits of the Crown Colony form of government. Froude argued that if the West Indian colonies were allowed home rule, the large black population in those colonies would vote for black leaders who would <b>strip</b> <b>away</b> whites' rights. Froude attacked blacks as being racially inferior, and argued that slavery was not as bad as it was commonly believed to be. Froude's work initially received good reviews in English newspapers and journals; however, it caused an outrage in the West Indian colonies.|$|E
25|$|On January 7, {{the storm}} complex {{weakened}} further, and the circulation {{in the western}} half of the storm completely collapsed, resulting in the storm's moisture spreading out {{throughout most of the}} Western United States. Soon afterwards, a few clumps of the mass of moisture organized into separate storm systems, while the dominant low over Canada stalled just southwest of Hudson Bay. As the storm complex moved westward on January 7, the instability in the air triggered a rare January tornado outbreak, spawning 58 tornadoes over the course of 2 days, resulting in the deaths of 4 more people. On January 8, the western fragment of the complex in the US dissipated, while the southern and eastern chunks continued to organize. On the same day, the 2nd storm system in the Gulf of Alaska was absorbed by another more powerful incoming extratropical cyclone, even as the main storm complex continued heading eastward across the United States. Later on January 8, the eastern chunk of the storm complex merged into the southern chunk, while the low near Hudson Bay began to deteriorate. On January 9, the low pressure center over the Great Lakes region became the dominant low of the storm complex. On the same day, the 1st storm over northern Canada was absorbed by a cold front, even as the storm complex continued to organize over the Eastern United States, triggering more tornadoes across the region. By January 9, the storm complex had organized into a 973 mbar storm to the northeast of the Great Lakes, and it began to <b>strip</b> <b>away</b> moisture from the low near Hudson Bay. The storm complex slowly moved northeastward, and the storm's outer rainband eventually exited the East Coast. On January 10, the low west of Hudson Bay dissipated, while the main storm complex began to exit Atlantic Canada. On January 11, the storm entered Labrador Sea, and stalled for several hours, before continuing to move northeastward. At the same time, the system gradually weakened. On January 12, the system reorganized to the southeast of Greenland, and was assigned the name Ilse by the Free University of Berlin. On January 14, Windstorm Ilse intensified to 980 mbars and impacted the United Kingdom and parts of Western Europe, before entering the Norwegian Sea on January 15. During the next couple of days, Windstorm Ilse accelerated northeastward, before turning to the east on January 17. On January 22, Ilse was absorbed by another extratropical cyclone to the south, over the Barents Sea.|$|E
500|$|When {{he first}} played with Mingus, Waldron was a {{follower}} of Horace Silver's style, which used added chords and passing notes, as well as Bud Powell's, which contained many runs. Mingus encouraged him to <b>strip</b> <b>away</b> these things and concentrate on basic and altered harmonies. Before his breakdown, Waldron played in a lyrical way, but after it, [...] "I couldn't find that lyricism inside myself any more, so I became a very angular player", becoming more like Thelonious Monk in playing and composition style.|$|E

These included its use as an internment centre during World War II, and the imprisonment of Aboriginal prisoners. The prioritisation of convict heritage was evident from the first conservation plans from before the prison closed. This aspect became more and more important through later plans by James Semple Kerr, authored in 1992 and reviewed in 1998, and subsequently in the state government's masterplan, released in December 2000. The convict-era focus is reflected in the branding of the tourist experience as [...] "Fremantle Prison – the Convict Establishment", and through restorations which, while necessary to prevent damage and deterioration, <b>strip</b> <b>away</b> the site's recent history.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Black's near-psychic visions; a phenomenon which had been used with much less frequency in the second season. Executive producer Glen Morgan begrudgingly allowed Maher and Reindl to show the ability in this episode, saying [...] "I felt last year those visions were a cheat. The camera {{would go to a}} coffee cup and Frank would say, 'The murderer used a coffee cup.' It drove me nuts. What we were trying to do this year was elevate Frank's visions to a dream-like state, so he would have to interpret what he's seeing. There would be more mystical, symbolic imagery that might give him more of a sense of what's going on. I had wanted to <b>strip</b> <b>away</b> the gift {{for a long time and}} see if the show really played without it. But we got back into that".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the episode was mostly positive. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club wrote highly of the episode and awarded it an A–. Handlen praised the episode's exploration of Mulder's mind, noting that the entry allowed the audience to see Mulder's views of the world. He argued that [...] "Mulder's desperate need to understand {{what happened to his}} sister [...] drives him to expect betrayal, because at least with betrayal, the world makes some kind of sense." [...] He did write, however, that he was [...] "a little disappointed at how [...] "Demons" [...] doesn't really hold up in retrospect from a story perspective," [...] but noted that [...] "what does work here is great." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode continued to <b>strip</b> <b>away,</b> in methodical fashion, Mulder’s psychological support system. [...] While there are some plot contrivances that are troubling, the episode as a whole comes together very well." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. She wrote that [...] "Demons" [...] works [...] "as a character study of Mulder" [...] and praised the episode's [...] "hyper-realistic flashback" [...] sequences. Vitaris, while calling the structure of the story [...] "not particularly imaginative", wrote that [...] "Mulder's condition is intriguing". Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it [...] "the wrong episode at the wrong time." [...] The two argued that the attention given to Mulder's potential [...] "aneurysm" [...] are oddly juxtaposed next to Scully's real, life-threatening brain cancer. However, they did call the flashback sequences [...] "masterpieces of editing", but noted that their contents [...] "lack information".|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{the second}} element created for the game, following the graphics created by Jensen. The gameplay was created and refined using rudimentary graphic elements to establish the types of puzzles they wanted to have, but aware of how these elements would {{be presented to the}} player in the released version. Limbo was designed to avoid the pitfalls of major titles, where the same gameplay mechanic is used repeatedly. Carlsen, initially brought aboard as a programmer for the custom game engine, became the lead designer after Playdead found him to be capable at creating puzzles. Carlsen stated that the puzzles within Limbo were designed to [...] " [...] you guessing all the way through". Jensen also wanted to make the puzzles feel like a natural part of the environment, and to avoid the feeling that the player was simply moving from puzzle to puzzle through the course of the game. Carlsen identified examples of puzzles from other games that he wanted to avoid. He wanted to avoid simple puzzles that gave the player little satisfaction in its solution, such as a puzzle in [...] that involved simply moving a sun-lit mirror to specific points in a room. In contrast, Carlsen wanted to avoid making the puzzle so complex with many separate parts that the player would resort to trial-and-error and eventually come out with the solution without thinking about why the solution worked; Carlsen used an example of a puzzle from the 2008 Prince of Persia game that had seven different mechanics that he never bothered to figure out himself. Carlsen designed Limbo puzzles to fall between these limits, demonstrating one puzzle that only has three elements: a switch panel, an electrified floor, and a chain; the goal—to use the chain to cross the electrified floor—is immediately obvious to the player, and then tasks the player to determine the right combination of moves and timing to complete it safely. They often had to <b>strip</b> <b>away</b> elements to make the puzzles more enjoyable and easier to figure out. The decision to provide little information to the player was an initial challenge in creating the game. From their initial pool of about 150 playtesters, several would have no idea of how to solve certain puzzles. To improve this, they created scenarios before troublesome spots that highlighted the appropriate actions; for example, when they found players did not think about pulling a boat onto shore to use as a platform to reach a higher ledge, they presented the player with a box-pulling puzzle earlier to demonstrate the pulling mechanics.|$|E

5000|$|In all genres, the <b>stripping</b> <b>away</b> {{of other}} {{instruments}} and vocals ("breaking-down" [...] the arrangement) helps create intense contrast, with breakdowns usually preceding or following heightened musical climaxes.

This is often treated {{with a lot of}} reverb and rises in tone to create an exciting climax. This noise then cuts to a beat of silence, creating tension on the dance floor before the return to the musical part of the record.|$|R
