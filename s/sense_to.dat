5|$|In the 2007 book, Currency Wars by Chinese {{economist}} Song Hongbing, {{the term}} is sometimes used in a somewhat contrary <b>sense,</b> <b>to</b> refer to an alleged practice where unscrupulous bankers lend to emerging market countries and then speculate against the emerging state's currency by trying to force it down in value against the wishes of that states' government.|$|E

Stossel was named co-anchor of 20/20 in May 2003, while he was writing his first book, Gimme a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media, which was published in 2004. In it, he details his start in journalism and consumer reporting, and how he evolved to harbor libertarian beliefs.|$|E

5|$|Later {{authors have}} used the term in a {{different}} <b>sense,</b> <b>to</b> mean the delimitation of species (not subspecies or taxa of other ranks), using whatever investigative techniques are available, and including sophisticated computational or laboratory techniques. Thus, Ernst Mayr in 1968 defined beta taxonomy as the classification of ranks higher than species.An understanding of the biological meaning of variation and of the evolutionary origin of groups of related species {{is even more important}} for the second stage of taxonomic activity, the sorting of species into groups of relatives ("taxa") and their arrangement in a hierarchy of higher categories. This activity is what the term classification denotes; it is also referred to as beta taxonomy.|$|E

5|$|Olfactory cues may be {{important}} in salmon, which are known {{to return to the}} exact river where they hatched. Lockley reports experimental evidence that fish such as minnows can accurately tell the difference between the waters of different rivers. Salmon may use their magnetic <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> navigate to within reach of their river, and then use olfaction to identify the river at close range.|$|E
5|$|Somewhat unusually among theropods, T.rex had a {{very long}} cochlea. The length of the cochlea is often related to hearing acuity, {{or at least the}} {{importance}} of hearing in behavior, implying that hearing was a particularly important <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> tyrannosaurs. Specifically, data suggests that Tyrannosaurus rex heard best in the low-frequency range, and that low-frequency sounds were an important part of tyrannosaur behavior.|$|E
5|$|Subdivision rules give a {{sequence}} of tilings of a surface, and tilings give an idea of distance, length, and area (by letting each tile have length and area 1). In the limit, the distances that come from these tilings may converge in some <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> an analytic structure on the surface. The Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for this to occur.|$|E

5|$|The homological mirror {{symmetry}} conjecture of Maxim Kontsevich {{states that}} the derived category of coherent sheaves on one Calabi–Yau manifold is equivalent in a certain <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> the Fukaya category of its mirror. This equivalence provides a precise mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry in topological string theory. In addition, it provides an unexpected bridge between two branches of geometry, namely complex and symplectic geometry.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} served in general by around {{half a dozen}} trains each way between North Walsham, Mundesley and Cromer Beach. However, with no direct service to Norwich - the nearest city - the halt was little-used, and closed in 1953 {{as part of a}} package of early {{rationalisation}} measures undertaken by British Railways after nationalisation, which also involved the closure of the line from Roughton Road Junction to Mundesley. The coastal line, although highly picturesque, carried little traffic and its closure made sound economic <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> British Railways.|$|E
5|$|The term {{coronation}} {{is sometimes}} {{used in a}} semi-ironic <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> refer to uncontested party leadership elections, with all potential party leaders choosing to back a single candidate or to stay silent, rather than stand in an election {{they are likely to}} lose. This typically happens where there has been a protracted behind-the-scenes attempt to remove the outgoing leader, leading to a significant amount of time to determine who has the most party support before the election proper.|$|E

5|$|A B {{movie or}} B {{film is a}} low-budget {{commercial}} movie, but one {{that is not an}} arthouse film. In its original usage, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the term more precisely identified films intended for distribution as the less-publicized bottom half of a double feature (akin to B-sides for recorded music). Although the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased {{by the end of the}} 1950s, the term B movie continues to be used in its broader <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> this day. In its post–Golden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition: on the one hand, the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient; on the other, many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, Whedon {{announced}} the film would be subtitled Age of Ultron. Despite the subtitle, {{the film is}} not based on the 2013 comic book miniseries Age of Ultron. Feige explained that they simply liked the title Age of Ultron but the plot was taken from decades of Avengers story arcs. Whedon added that Ultron's origin would differ from his comics roots, and that Hank Pym would not be involved with Ultron's creation. Whedon disclosed that Edgar Wright had rights to the character first through his inclusion in Ant-Man, which was already in development. He also thought that Ultron needed to be conceived through the Avengers and since they already had Tony Stark and Bruce Banner on the team, it would not make <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> bring in a third scientist. Whedon also said the film would have a darker tone due to Ultron's involvement.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1991, however, falling {{inflation}} {{had reduced}} WMATA's construction costs {{so much that}} the agency said it could build the two final Green Line stations in Prince George's County without asking Congress for additional money. WMATA also proposed spending money almost three times faster up-front to accelerate its construction schedule, a move which would be more than compensated for by savings in out-years. Prince George's County officials threatened to block all further Metrorail construction unless they received guarantees that the stations in their county would be built. Funding for the remaining seven Green Line stations in the District and Prince George's remained in doubt as of August 1991, with District officials saying that it made <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> build the Georgia Avenue – Petworth and Columbia Heights stations and Prince George's representatives demanding that the three stations in their county be completed. WMATA said that it had so little money it could not fund 16 critical small construction projects, among them security gates at the Navy Yard and Waterfront stations and parts for escalators at the seven new Green Line stations in D.C. and Prince George's County. The funding impasse was broken in November 1991 when local and state governments agreed to roughly triple their contribution to Metro's construction costs by 1994 to complete the entire system.|$|E

25|$|The literal <b>sense</b> {{pertains}} <b>to</b> {{the meaning}} of the words themselves, including any figurative meanings. The spiritual <b>senses</b> pertain <b>to</b> the significance of the things (persons, places, objects or events) denoted by the words. Of the three spiritual senses, the allegorical sense is foundational. It relates persons, events, and institutions of earlier covenants to those of later covenants, and especially to the New Covenant. Building on the allegorical sense, the moral sense instructs in regard to action, and the anagogical <b>sense</b> points <b>to</b> man's final destiny. The teaching of the Catechism on Scripture has encouraged the recent pursuit of covenantal theology, an approach that employs the four <b>senses</b> <b>to</b> structure salvation history via the biblical covenants.|$|R
