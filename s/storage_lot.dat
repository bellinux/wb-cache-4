The current depot consists of a two-story brick administration building facing Commercial Street, and shop for repairs, inspection and washing facing Newtown Creek, along with a large <b>storage</b> <b>lot</b> for buses. The depot holds around 120 buses at capacity. At one time, it operated ten lines: B18 (discontinued), B24, B29 (now part of the B24), B30 (discontinued), B39 (discontinued/reestablished 2013), B48, B59 (now Q59), B60, B61 (originally the Crosstown Line, since split into a new B61 and B62), and B62 (now part of the B43). The B62's northern terminal was located one block away from the depot at Manhattan Avenue and Box Street. The depot operations ended on November 7, 1981 because of service reductions and operating cost. It later stored several new General Motors-built RTS-04 buses awaiting entry into revenue service in 1982.|$|E

Salvage yards also buy most of the wrecked, derelict and abandoned vehicles that are sold at auction from police impound <b>storage</b> <b>lots,</b> and often buy vehicles from insurance tow yards as well. The salvage yard will usually tow the vehicle from the location of its purchase to the yard, but occasionally vehicles are driven in. At the salvage yard the automobiles are typically arranged in rows, often stacked on top of one another.

The present work evaluated the physiological and sanitary quality of seeds of three varieties of herbaceous cotton stored for three (Lot 1) and twelve months (Lot 2). Analyses were performed in the Laboratório de Análise de Sementes e de Fitopatologia of the Centro de Ciências Agrárias, Areia-PB, and included tests for: emergence (E), vigor (IVE), green weight (PV), dry weight (PS) and the "Blotter test". Tests for physiological quality were performed in a randomized manner using a (3 x 2) factorial scheme, with four replicates with 25 seeds. Data on sanitary quality are presented according to the fungus index expressed as percentages. Seeds of the varieties CNPA 7 H and BRS Verde demonstrated good levels of emergence after up to 12 months of storage, while seeds of the variety BRS Verde initially demonstrated dormancy, although this was overcome during storage.

50|$|Center Island is a 178-acre private island a short {{distance}} from Anacortes, nestled between Decatur and Lopez Islands. The island is served with electricity and telephone but accessible only by private boat or airplane. Most property owners boat from Anacortes and those without their own boat can arrange a water taxi from Skyline Marina in Anacortes or charter a flight. Most of the island is platted so all of the owners share in the common elements including the airfield, docks and boat ramp, boat/trailer <b>storage</b> <b>lot,</b> water system, clubhouse, caretakers quarters, beach lot, vehicles and other equipment useful in construction. There is a restriction of privately owned internal-combustion vehicles, so golf carts are the typical mode of transportation. The roads generally accommodate barged-in commercial vehicles for the delivering of construction materials. All residential building requires septic installation. Not all lots have access to the water system and those that are eligible are subject to evidence of the building and septic permits. Center Island is private so non-owners must be guests of owners or be escorted by an authorized person. There are mostly summer vacation homes there; however a small number of residents do live on Center year-round, including full-time caretakers. Facilities include a clubhouse, community picnic areas, a community dock and a place to pull small boats {{out of the water and}} put them on land.

In order to evaluate coverage, the facilities were modeled using the Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Computer Code (MCNP). MCNP was then used to simulate criticality accidents at various locations in the X- 710 and X- 760 buildings and the north half of the X- 7745 -R <b>storage</b> <b>lot.</b> The associated neutron flux at current detector locations was calculated. The neutron flux was then converted to an absorbed dose rate (in tissue) and compared with the Portsmouth criticality accident alarm set-point of 5 mrad/hr. The parameters defining the simulated criticality accidents have been calculated as ``the minimum accident of concern`` as defined in ANSI Standard ANS 8. 3 - 1986. These calculations are documented in Portsmouth report POEF-SH- 31. The results of this evaluation indicate that the X- 710 and X- 760 buildings and surrounding roads are adequately covered by the CAAS systems that are currently in place in those buildings.
