50|$|The {{reversed}} (that is, upside down) chevron forms a V, {{which is}} meant to stand for the village’s patron saint, Valentine, and the <b>scythe</b> <b>blades</b> refer to the agriculture that is the villagers’ main livelihood even today.|$|R
50|$|The municipality’s arms {{might be}} {{described}} thus: Argent a chevron reversed gules, the ends in chief and the point at the base, surmounted on each side by a <b>scythe</b> <b>blade</b> of the field, the points to base.|$|R
50|$|The <b>scythe</b> <b>blade</b> {{manufacturer}} {{in the village}} was founded in 1835 by Richard Messer, Joseph Phillips and Anthony Colby. Still in their twenties, Messer and Phillips had learned the business in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, while Colby provided the water rights but no capital.|$|R
50|$|Mad Mother (Maddo Mazaa): Appears in episode 47. Powers include disguising {{itself as}} a statue, impaling tendrils from the back, a <b>scythe,</b> <b>blade</b> {{resistant}} armor, and four energy cannons hidden in the abdomen. It is a command unit of the black chieftains piloted by Eva Fahrzeug. Reappears in Brave Saga.|$|R
50|$|Cable {{also made}} use of a spear-like weapon called the Psi-Mitar, which was {{originally}} a long staff with a spear point on one end and a <b>scythe</b> <b>blade</b> on the other, used primarily by the Askani. It functions as a focus and amplifier for telepathic or telekinetic power, which it can project as powered blasts.|$|R
5000|$|Nerull {{is usually}} {{seen as a}} black-robed skeleton, with a rust-red body and green, ropy hair. He carries a staff called [...] "Lifecutter" [...] that at his command grows a <b>scythe</b> <b>blade</b> made of scarlet energy. His {{alignment}} is Neutral Evil. Nerull is the patron deity of those who seek the greatest evil for their own enjoyment or gain.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the years}} many knives {{have been called}} Bowie knives and the term has almost become a generic term for any large sheath knife. During {{the early days of}} the American Civil War Confederate {{soldiers}} carried immense knives called D-Guard Bowie knives. [...] Many of these knives could have qualified as short swords and were often made from old saw or <b>scythe</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|R
50|$|The municipality’s arms {{might in}} English heraldic {{language}} be described thus: Per pale argent a cross gules surmounted by a rose Or and vert an ear of wheat couped {{of the third}} and a <b>scythe</b> <b>blade</b> palewise, the point to base, of the first, in a base {{of the first two}} ravens, wings endorsed, of the second, armed sable, the one to dexter sinister.|$|R
50|$|The scythe and pitchfork, farming tools, have {{frequently}} {{been used as}} a weapon by those who couldn't afford or didn't have access to more expensive weapons such as pikes, swords, or later, guns. Scythes and pitchforks were stereotypically carried by angry mobs or gangs of enraged peasants. The process usually involved reforging the <b>blade</b> of a <b>scythe</b> at a 90 degree angle, strengthening the joint between the blade and the shaft with an additional metal pipe or bolts and reinforcing the shaft to better protect it against cuts from enemy blades. At times, instead of a <b>scythe</b> <b>blade,</b> a blade from a hand-operated chaff cutter was used.|$|R
50|$|No {{one knows}} how much value to give to this statement. There is the deep {{suspicion}} that it reflects Claudian propaganda to add glory to the Roman invasion of Britain by making the Britons more sophisticated than they were. There is no accepted archaeological evidence concerning scythed chariots. There are some large heavy <b>scythe</b> <b>blades</b> from late Roman Britain which are too unwieldy {{for a man to}} use.However, a scythed chariot appears in The Cattle-Raid of Cooley (Táin Bó Cúailnge), the central epic of the Ulster cycle of Early Irish literature.|$|R
50|$|The cross {{refers to}} the village’s former {{allegiance}} to the Electorate of Trier. The rose recalls Rosenthal Monastery, which had holdings in the village {{as long ago as}} 1331. Illerich grew up in early times from an estate to today’s municipality, in which agriculture has been practised to the present day. Referring to this are the ear of wheat and the <b>scythe</b> <b>blade.</b> The charge in the base, the two ravens, are Saint Vincent’s attribute, thus representing the municipality’s and the church’s patron saint, who has enjoyed this distinction since 1569.|$|R
2500|$|Four {{miles from}} Horncastle is {{the village of}} Winceby. During the 1643 Battle of Winceby [...] which helped to secure Lincolnshire for Parliament [...] leader Oliver Cromwell was almost killed. Local {{legend has it that}} the {{thirteen}} <b>scythe</b> <b>blades,</b> which hang {{on the wall of the}} south chapel of St. Mary's Church, were used as weapons at Winceby. This story is generally regarded as apocryphal. The accepted historical opinion is that they probably date from the Lincolnshire Rising of 1536. Both theories about the origin of the scythes are discussed at [...] "Church History", Lincoln website.|$|R
5000|$|The college {{arms are}} blazoned as [...] "Gules two <b>Scythe</b> <b>blades</b> in saltire in chief the Cross of St Cuthbert Argent And for the Crest On a Wreath of the Colours {{in front of}} a Castle of three Towers Sable a silver penannular brooch proper the ends charged with Gilded Crosses of St Cuthbert." [...] The scythes and the red field are taken from Bishop Van Mildert's episcopal arms; the cross of St Cuthbert is a common emblem of Durham City and University. The college {{generally}} uses only the shield of its arms for most purposes.|$|R
50|$|The {{cutting edge}} of a <b>scythe</b> <b>blade</b> is {{traditionally}} maintained by occasional peening followed by frequent honing. Peening reforms the malleable edge, by hammering, to: create the desired profile, to temper the metal and to remove minor nicks and dents. For mowing fine grass the bevel angle may be peened extremely fine, while for coarser work a larger angle is created to give a more robust edge. Peening requires some skill and is done using a peening hammer and special anvils or by using a peening jig. Historically, a peening station was {{set up on the}} edge of the field during harvest but now more likely back in the workshop.|$|R
5000|$|The statue portrays Boudica (commonly {{written as}} [...] "Boadicea" [...] in the Victorian era), Queen of the Iceni tribe of Britons, {{accompanied}} by her two daughters, {{mounted on a}} scythed chariot drawn by two rearing horses. The chariot is based on Roman models, not native British or Iceni models, and has a <b>scythe</b> <b>blade</b> attached to each wheel. She stands upright, in a flowing gown, with a spear {{in her right hand}} and her left hand raised. Her daughters with bared breasts crouch in the chariot, one to either side of their mother. None of them is holding any reins to control the horses.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are now {{near the}} Court, young man," [...] {{answered}} his guide; [...] "and, Pasques-dieu! {{there is some}} difference betwixt walking in this region and on your own heathy hills. Every yard of this ground, excepting the path which we now occupy, is rendered dangerous, and well nigh impracticable, by snares and traps, armed with <b>scythe</b> <b>blades,</b> which shred off the unwary passenger's limb as sheerly as a hedge bill lops a hawthorn sprig--and calthrops that would pierce your foot through, and pitfalls deep enough to bury you in them for ever; for you are now within the precincts of the royal demesne, and we shall presently see {{the front of the}} Chateau." ...|$|R
5000|$|Compared to a fauchard (which is {{believed}} to have evolved from the war <b>scythe),</b> the <b>blade</b> of the war scythe has the cutting edge on the concave side like the agricultural tool whereas the fauchard has the edge along the convex side.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Scythe</b> and sickle <b>blades</b> have {{traditionally}} been sharpened by occasional peening followed by frequent honing in the field during use. In the example below, a short <b>scythe</b> <b>blade,</b> being used for clearing brambles, is being sharpened by reforming the malleable steel to create an edge profile that can then be honed. Because this blade {{is being used to}} cut tough-stemmed brambles it is being peened about every thirty hours of work. Nicks and cuts to the blade edge are also worked out of the blade by peening and a new edge profile then formed for honing. A peening jig is used here but blades can be free-peened using various designs of peening anvils. The peening jig shown has two interchangeable caps that set different angles. A coarse angle is set first about 3mm back from the edge and the fine angle is then set on the edge, leaving an edge that lends itself to being easily honed. The blade is then honed using progressively finer honing stones and then taken to the field.|$|R
50|$|Metal Satan: {{appears in}} episode 22. Powers include flight, a double <b>bladed</b> <b>scythe,</b> and a beam cannon in the torso.|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} half of the series his powers {{included}} instilling life into rocks to create fossil beasts and eye heat rays when he was in his statue form until episode 27. Upon being released his powers included forming an entire island in a matter of seconds dubbed Demon Isle, psychically freezing weapons in mid air, seeing into other dimension, causing fissures, fusing colossal monsters together, manipulation of the elements, hand lightning bolts and energy beams, mouth flames that create flaming tornadoes, purple horn energy bolts and balls, a bow and arrow, a barbed boomerang, summoning flames from the middle cave of his island, a giant <b>scythe,</b> <b>blade</b> resistance, levitation, constricting roots from the lower half of his body, and a pair of broadswords with hidden saw blades.|$|R
50|$|The use of scythes {{is still}} {{widespread}} today as many pastures are too steep for modern farm machinery so scythes {{are used to}} cut grass or bracken. Working <b>scythes</b> have <b>blades</b> between 0.9-0.95m long but competition scythes range from 1.18-1.24m in length. A decent segalari can manage some 5000m2 in a day.|$|R

60|$|Frank {{dropped his}} <b>scythe</b> <b>blade</b> and leaned upon the haft. He had been mowing since sunrise, and the shadows were now rapidly lengthening. His back ached {{and his hands}} were sore, and he found it a relief to stand still a moment and look about him. On {{one side of the}} {{clearing}} the slanting sunrays struck deep into the forest, forcing up great columnar trunks out of the shadow. On the other, the fretted pinnacles of the firs cut sharp against the sky, and between stretched long swathes of fallen timothy and fern already turning yellow. Not far away, Mr. Oliver, sitting in the mower's saddle, was guiding his team {{along the edge of the}} grass which fell beneath the rasping knife, and the clink and rattle of the machine rang sharply through the still, evening air. Frank, stripped to blue shirt and trousers, found everything his eyes rested on pleasant, and he felt that, after all, he had done wisely when he left the cities.|$|R
50|$|Pumpkin: Appears in episode 36. Powers include flight, {{emitting}} {{seeds of}} giant pumpkin plants armed with destructive vines, a long <b>bladed</b> <b>scythe,</b> yellow eye beams, and finger machine guns. Reappears in Brave Saga.|$|R
2500|$|On October 30 at {{approximately}} 4 p.m., the militia rode into the community. [...] David Evans, {{a leader in}} the community, ran towards the militia, waving his hat and calling for peace. [...] Alerted to the militia's approach, most of the Latter-day Saint women and children fled into the woods to the south, while most of the men headed to the blacksmith shop. [...] Unfortunately, the building was a particularly vulnerable structure as the widely spaced logs made it easy for the attackers to fire inside. [...] The shop became a deathtrap, since the militia gave no quarter, discharging about 100 rifles into the building. Grand River Township Justice of the Peace Thomas McBride, wounded while escaping the blacksmith shop, surrendered his gun to Jacob S Rogers Jr. who shot him, then hacked his body with a corn knife (<b>scythe</b> <b>blade).</b> [...] According to their own account they fired seven rounds making upwards of 1,600 shot during the attack of Haun's Mill. The attack lasted 30 to 60 minutes. The sun set at 5:16p.m.|$|R
60|$|The lads {{were now}} able to look round at the wild group which filled the clearing. The greater portion were peasants, {{although}} the dress and bearing of several proclaimed that they belonged to a superior class. Some of the peasants were armed with guns, but these were quite in the minority, the greater portion carrying <b>scythe</b> <b>blades</b> fastened to long handles. These, although clumsy to look at, were terrible weapons in a close onslaught, and the Russian soldiers could seldom be kept firm by their officers when, {{in spite of their}} fire, the Polish peasantry rushed among them. The Poles were in high spirits. Their own loss had been small, and they had inflicted great slaughter upon the head of the Russian column, and had gained a considerable number of arms. A party which had attacked the rear of the column at the same moment when the main body fell upon its head, had for a time obtained possession of a wagon with spare ammunition, and had succeeded in carrying off the greater part of it.|$|R

50|$|The scythe {{was invented}} in about 500 BC and {{appeared}} in Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries (though the German image to the right is from the 9th century??). Initially used mostly for mowing hay, it had replaced the sickle for reaping crops by the 16th century as the scythe was better ergonomically and consequently more efficient. In about 1800 the grain cradle, was sometimes added to the standard scythe when mowing grain; the cradle was an addition of light wooden fingers above the <b>scythe</b> <b>blade</b> which kept the grain stems aligned and the heads together to make the collection and threshing easier. In the developed world the scythe has largely {{been replaced by the}} motorised lawn mower and combine harvester. However, the scythe remained in common use for many years after the introduction of machines because a side-mounted finger-bar mower, whether horse or tractor drawn, could not mow in front of itself and scythes were still needed to open up a meadow by clearing the first swathe to give the mechanical mower room to start.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the years}} after the 'restoration' several people {{familiar}} with the figure commented that the feet were altered, having originally both pointed outwards and downwards so that [...] "the Giant appeared to be coming down the hill", in the words of Ann Downs, who had grown up at Wilmington Priory in the 1840s. Resistivity surveys conducted in the 1990s by R. Castleden, combined with examination of apparent shadow marks shown in early photographs, have provided strong evidence that the feet had in fact pointed outwards as described by 19th century observers and had been slightly lower than in the current outline. There was also some evidence to suggest that the feature on one staff similar to a <b>scythe</b> <b>blade,</b> flail or shepherd's crook was genuine, along with a suggestion of a [...] "helmet" [...] or hat. It seems likely that the proportions of the figure have been distorted slightly by the 1873 bricking and the 1969 replacement of the bricks with breeze blocks, with the Long Man having been up to 75.5 m tall prior to 1873.|$|R
50|$|Daidoji Tessai (大道寺 鉄斎) - The {{oldest of}} the seven spears, Tessai wields a two-handed scythe that can be split in half to form a kusarigama. The weapon also {{contains}} a weighted chain in {{the butt of the}} handle and a retractable secondary <b>scythe</b> <b>blade</b> in the head. Tessai is easily angered and will even lash out at his allies if he feels they've insulted him. Tessai often goes to the Yoshiwara brothel district to purchase women on his lord Akinari's behalf. In fact, a flashback in the first volume reveals that Tessai was the one who requested that Hori Mondo send his daughter (Ochie) to serve as Akinari's mistress. In response, Mondo rebuked Tessai, insulted Akinari, and later lead the doomed rebellion against his cruel lord, setting off the events of the story. Tessai dies {{at the hands of the}} Hori women, ambushed at dusk in the streets of Yoshiwara. After a short fight, the women trap and immobilize both ends of his chained weapon, then rush in from all sides to stab him with their blades. He is the first of the Spears to die.|$|R
