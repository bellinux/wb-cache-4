5|$|Images {{from the}} series {{have long been}} {{licensed}} for use on merchandise, the success of Tintin magazine helping to create a market for <b>such</b> <b>items.</b> Tintin's image {{has been used to}} sell a wide variety of products, from alarm clocks to underpants. Countless separate items related to the character have been available, with some becoming collectors' items in their own right.|$|E
5|$|The Darnytsia {{soldiers}} soon gave {{themselves a}} special banner, {{based on the}} Romanian tricolor, with the added slogan Trăiască România Mare ("Long Live Greater Romania").

In 1992, the IRS determined the Reagans had failed to include some $3 million worth of fashion items between 1983 and 1988 on their tax returns; they were billed for a large amount of back taxes and interest, which was subsequently paid.|$|E
5|$|Natural thorium decays {{very slowly}} {{compared}} {{to many other}} radioactive materials, and the emitted alpha radiation cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts of thorium, {{such as those in}} gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of <b>such</b> <b>items</b> may pose some risks. Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung, pancreas, and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases.|$|E

In addition to being state symbols in their own right, horses have also appeared in state symbols; for example, a horse's head appears on the Seal of New Jersey.|$|E

50|$|Ria {{is able to}} hold herself {{together}} long enough to direct the player's character how to escape from slow death in the dungeons. Past that point, she lacks the power to manifest physically, and appears to the player during dreams. The central quest requires the player to obtain various artifacts. Each time <b>such</b> an <b>item</b> is found, Silmane appears {{the next time the}} player rests, in order to provide the general location of the next <b>such</b> <b>item.</b> This culminates in the player finding and assembling the pieces of the Staff of Chaos, battling Tharn in the Imperial City, and rescuing the Emperor.|$|R

5|$|A world map is {{available}} and, at the beginning, the player is allocated {{one of the}} twenty regions of a fictional, idyllic country to destroy. As the player progresses through these regions, each representing a level, the areas previously conquered will appear ransacked, twisted, and evil. The goals for each level are straightforward: they generally fall {{along the lines of}} eliminating the heroic force or destroying all other Dungeon Keepers. The first few levels are tutorials, teaching the player the basics. Special items are hidden throughout certain levels. <b>Such</b> <b>items</b> perform actions such as increasing the player's creatures' experience level, or revealing the map. They can reveal a hidden level, where the player must perform a specific task, and is rewarded upon completion.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of filming for a {{computer}} game, certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately, like Adrienne simply crossing a room. Many of the actors, including Morsell, Lee and Bailey, had never done any blue screen acting before, and Miano had only done it once. Morsell in particular said she found it challenging because it was so physically constrictive. <b>Such</b> <b>items</b> as tables, chairs, doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen, and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with. During one scene, David Homb accidentally stood {{in such a way that}} his arm appeared to be going through the living room wall.|$|E

The Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed in May 2003, as a collaboration between USAID and Malagasy artisan producers to support the export of local handicrafts to foreign markets. Imports of <b>such</b> <b>items</b> as foodstuffs, fuel, capital goods, vehicles, consumer goods and electronics consume an estimated 52percent of GDP.

5|$|Horse {{ownership}} {{was widespread}} by the 12th century. Both tenant farmers and landlords {{were involved in}} the harrowing of land for arable crops in the relatively new open field system, and employed horses for this work. Horses and carts were increasingly used for transporting farm goods and implements; peasants were obliged to transport <b>such</b> <b>items</b> in their own carts, though the poorest may have had to rely on one horse for all their farm work. The necessity for carting produce revolutionised communication between villages. Horse-breeding as an enterprise continued; in the 14th century, Hexham Priory had 80broodmares, the Prior of Durham owned two stud farms, Rievaulx Abbey owned one, Gilbert d'Umfraville, Earl of Angus, in Scotland, had significant grazing lands for mares, and horse-breeding was being carried out both east and west of the Pennines.|$|E
5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei, players {{take the}} role of an unnamed protagonist, a teenage boy who can {{communicate}} with demons using a computer program. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} other games in the series: players make their way through dungeons and fight against demons in a first-person perspective. The protagonist uses a variety of weapons and items, with the primary weapons being swords and guns. <b>Such</b> <b>items</b> are bought from merchants scattered around the world map. In special areas, the protagonist can use the in-game currency to restore health and magic points for themselves and their demons, remove status ailments, and revive fallen demons. Special Terminals scattered across the world map allow the player to save their game, and they can use them to teleport between terminals in different areas of Tokyo.|$|E

The entire crew were given goat-skin mats to sleep on. Lighting for each living area was provided by small skylights in the deck above, which were covered by an iron hatch during battle. The officer's wardroom was located forward of the berth deck where officers would eat their meals, hold meetings or socialize during what little spare time they had. It was well furnished with an oriental rug, a large oak table and other <b>such</b> <b>items.</b> Ericsson had personally paid for the costs of all the officer's furnishings.|$|E

5|$|Padayappa was {{released}} on 10 April 1999 {{on the eve of}} Tamil New Year's day. This was the first Tamil film to be released worldwide without the involvement of distributors. It was also the first Tamil film to be released worldwide with 210 prints, and 700,000 audio cassettes. The film's rights in Japan were sold for US$50,000, which was the highest an Indian film fetched for commercial release in 1999. Co-producer Thenappan registered the film posters as a Class 34 trademark in 1998, to be used for trademarking <b>such</b> <b>items</b> as beedis, cigarettes, cheroots and tobacco, making it the first instance of brand extension in the Tamil film industry. The pre-release business of the film's overseas rights amounted to 30 million. According to an estimate by trade analyst Sreedhar Pillai, the value of the theatrical and satellite rights for Padayappa was approximately 20 million.|$|E
5|$|The Undertaker {{had been}} feuding with DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation since {{his return to}} the WWF from an injury in August 1994. During the match between The Undertaker and Yokozuna at Survivor Series 1994, Irwin R. Schyster, one of DiBiase's wrestlers, {{interfered}} in the match by attacking The Undertaker. The feud between The Undertaker and Schyster escalated when Schyster performed a series of vignettes in which he repossessed <b>such</b> <b>items</b> as tombstones and burial plots from people he claimed had not paid their taxes before dying. During the feud, Schyster was escorted to the ring for his matches by a group of hooded druids.|$|E
5|$|The hoard {{contains}} about 100 silver and silver-gilt items; {{the number is}} imprecise because there are unmatched broken parts. They include a statuette of a leaping tigress, made as a handle for an object such as a jug or lamp; four pepper-pots (piperatoria); a beaker; a vase or juglet (a small jug); four bowls; a small dish; and 98 silver spoons and ladles. The beaker and juglet are decorated with similar leaf and stem patterns, and the juglet has three gilded bands. In contrast, the small bowls and dish are plain, and it is presumed that {{the owners of the}} Hoard had many more <b>such</b> <b>items,</b> probably including the large decorated dishes found in other hoards. Many pieces are gilded in parts to accentuate the decoration. The technique of fire-gilding with mercury was used, as was typical at the time.|$|E
