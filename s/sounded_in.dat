5|$|In late January 1945 the Imperial General Headquarters belatedly {{adopted a}} civil defense plan {{to counter the}} American air raids. This plan {{assigned}} responsibility for fighting fires to community councils and neighborhood groups as the professional firefighting units were short-handed. Civilians were to observe a blackout from 10:00pm. Japanese positions in the Bonin Islands were normally able to provide an hour's warning of American raids and air raid sirens were <b>sounded</b> <b>in</b> cities threatened by attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{major event}} of the second day (August 31, 1983) was the {{successful}} deployment of the INSAT-1B satellite, which took place at 7:48 UTC, with Challenger then maneuvering to avoid the firing of the booster motor forty minutes later. Other experimentation continued, though telemetry through TDRS was lost for around three hours, requiring manual intervention. A fire alarm <b>sounded</b> <b>in</b> the morning, indicating signs of {{a fire in the}} avionics compartment, but a second alarm remained silent and it was eventually determined to be a false alarm.|$|E
5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm <b>sounded</b> <b>in</b> the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E

5000|$|A {{problem with}} {{teaching}} {{the reading of}} English with this analytical approach is that English words {{do not have a}} one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship. If they did have a one-to-one relationship, reading would be easier. In general, with a few common exceptions, the consonants do have a one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship but the vowels do not. For instance the letter [...] "a" [...] represents one <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> the word [...] "say", a second <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> [...] "at", a third <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> [...] "any", a fourth <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> [...] "are", a fifth <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> [...] "all", a sixth <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> [...] "about", a seventh <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> [...] "father", an eighth <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> [...] "orange", and a ninth <b>sound</b> (silence) <b>in</b> [...] "bread". The speech-sounds are sometimes influenced by (a) the letters surrounding the target vowel, (b) by the sentence containing the word and (c) the stress, or lack thereof, given to the syllable containing the letter.|$|R
50|$|Systematic {{relationships}} between <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> Greek and <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> other Indo-European languages are taken as strong evidence for reconstruction by historical linguists, because such relationships indicate that these sounds may {{go back to}} an inherited <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> the proto-language.|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of Northwest Airlines Flight 255, which {{happened}} 21 years earlier than flight 5022, also an MD-82, the crew had similarly been disrupted from routine operation before the fatal takeoff, and the alarm similarly had not <b>sounded.</b> <b>In</b> that accident, {{the reason for the}} lack of TOWS alarm was a tripped (or pulled) circuit breaker. However, examination of the alarm and its circuit breaker in flight 5022 had not revealed any fault.|$|E
25|$|At 4:45 PM EST, {{the moment}} the first fire alarm was <b>sounded</b> <b>in</b> 1911, {{hundreds}} of bells rang out in cities and towns across the nation.

25|$|April 1944 {{brought more}} coastal escorting, screening, patrolling, and {{military}} assault and landing exercises, often with PC-553 and PC-1225. Three air raids were <b>sounded</b> <b>in</b> April while {{the ship was}} berthed. On 27 April 1944, five Landing Ship, Tanks (LST) were attacked just behind PC-552s convoy. About 400 sailors and soldiers died. Overnight there was sporadic gunfire and illumination fire. On 29 April 1944, PC-552 set her flag at half mast {{in memory of the}} Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox and for those lost during the engagement with German E-boats on 27–28 April.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 9 A.M., {{with the}} {{submersible}} {{about to be}} lifted {{out of the water}} with a towline back onto the ship, a water alarm <b>sounded</b> <b>in</b> the aft sphere, a self-contained part of the submersible containing machinery and oil storage. The towline had apparently fouled on the aft sphere hatch and wrenched it open. With the sound of water entering the aft compartment, Pisces III became inverted and began to sink back to the seabed. The aft sphere was now fully flooded. The additional weight of water now added over a tonne of extra weight to the submersible.|$|E
25|$|On 7 March the Palace Hotel {{where the}} raid {{planning}} was being undertaken caught fire, {{it might have}} been sabotage, and to avoid calling the civilian fire brigade, who might see the attack plans inside the building, the Germans rigged it with explosives to create a fire break, however they exploded early, killing nine soldiers. Next day, on 8 March, to coincide with a spring tide, 13 ships sailed. One American patrol boat guarding the port of Granville, PC564 was alerted by a radar station that identified the convoy, but when it went to the attack, PC564 was destroyed by 88mm shells from German ferries armed with 8.8 cm SK C/35 naval guns. No alert had been <b>sounded</b> <b>in</b> Granville and the ships carrying German troops landed almost unopposed at the French port.|$|E

25|$|Among Sephardi Jews, prayers {{known as}} Selichot (forgiveness) are recited before the regular morning service (these {{are the same}} prayers recited before Rosh Hashanah). In the {{different}} prayers of this day, Syrian Jews pray in the same maqam (melody) as on the high holidays. In Amsterdam {{and in a few}} places in England, America, and elsewhere, the shofar is also <b>sounded</b> <b>in</b> connection with the processions. The latter practice reflects the idea that Hoshana Rabbah {{is the end of the}} High Holy Day season, when the world is judged for the coming year. Because Hoshanah Rabbah is also linked to the high holidays as well as being a joy filled day some Hasidic communities such as Satmar have the custom of having Birchat Cohanim/Priestly Blessing recited during the Mussaf service. Some communities such as Bobov will only do this if it is on Friday. However this practice is not generally done.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, the United States {{was happy}} and prosperous {{in various ways}} (leading to the {{nickname}} Roaring Twenties), but it also suffered from rapid change and social tensions. Some people were disenchanted by, and alienated from, the outside world. Many common people believed that World War I had resulted in extensive and largely senseless carnage, and they supported isolationism for the US. According to scholar Peter Rollins (1976), Rogers {{appeared to be an}} anchor of stability; his conventional home life and traditional moral code reminded people of a recent past. His newspaper column, which ran from 1922 to 1935, expressed his traditional morality and his belief that political problems were not as serious as they <b>sounded.</b> <b>In</b> his films, Rogers began by playing a simple cowboy; his characters evolved to explore the meaning of innocence in ordinary life. In his last movies, Rogers explores a society fracturing into competing classes from economic pressures. Throughout his career, Rogers was a link to a better, more comprehensible past.|$|E

In the centre of the upper band is depicted a king in conversation with a bishop, and a forester alongside, possibly indicating the making of an historic appointment of Forester. The horn was noted by William Camden (1551–1623) who stated it then to belong to the Seymour family, possibly an heirloom inherited from their Sturmy ancestors, hereditary Wardens of Savernake Forest since the reign of King Henry II (1154–89).

25|$|In {{the fourth}} Test at Headingley, Strauss was distracted {{before the start}} of play by team {{selection}} issues, with Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff both injured, and a back spasm to Matt Prior delaying play by ten minutes as his fitness to play was ascertained.

More runs for Michael Clarke and Marcus North led Australia to a total of 445. Strauss and Alastair Cook responded with an opening partnership of 58 before Ben Hilfenhaus removed Strauss for 32; England capitulated, this time to Hilfenhaus and Mitchell Johnson en route to an innings defeat.|$|E
25|$|Since {{appeasement}} only {{appeared to}} encourage the Japanese crew, who were joined by their compatriots from a nearby shipwreck, the Portuguese authorities hardened their stance lest the Japanese tried to take over Macau. On November 30, the Japanese gang got into a serious brawl. When the Portuguese ouvidor (magistrate) came to stop the fight, he got injured and his retainers killed. Church bells were <b>sounded</b> <b>in</b> alarm following this incident, and Captain-major André Pessoa arrived at the scene with all available armed reinforcements. The Japanese fled and took refuge in two houses, which were quickly surrounded by Portuguese soldiers. Pessoa offered quarter {{to those who would}} surrender, but 27 of those in the first house refused and were gunned down when they were forced out of the house by fire. The Jesuits and the Bishop of Macau intervened as Pessoa prepared to storm the second house, and the Japanese there, numbering around 50, were induced to surrender on the promise of life and freedom. However, Pessoa had the suspected ringleaders strangled in jail, while the rest were allowed to leave Macau after signing an affidavit absolving the Portuguese from all blame.|$|E

25|$|The {{daylight}} {{bombing of}} Schaffhausen on 1 April 1944 by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) {{was the most}} serious of all incidents. Approximately 50 B-24 Liberators of a larger force misidentified Schaffhausen as their target Ludwigshafen am Rhein near Mannheim (about 235km north of Schaffhausen), and dropped sixty tons of bombs on the town. Although an air raid alarm <b>sounded</b> <b>in</b> Schaffhausen, air raid sirens had been set off so many times without any attack that the locals felt safe, and many failed to take cover. A total of 40 {{people were killed and}} about 270 injured, and large parts of the town were destroyed. At the insistence of the Swiss government for an explanation, Allied investigations into the incident found that bad weather broke up the American formation over France, and that high winds that nearly doubled the ground speed of the bombers confused the navigators. (Two other widely scattered cities in Germany and France were also mistakenly bombed during the same mission.) As Schaffhausen is situated on the right bank (north side) of the Rhine river, it was apparently assumed to be the German city. By October 1944, 4 million dollars had been paid in restitution.|$|E
25|$|Flight day 6 was {{dedicated}} to transferring supplies from the MPLM Leonardo and the space shuttle mid-deck. The crews transferred the Windows Observational Research Facility (WORF) to the Destiny lab. Mission specialist Naoko Yamazaki, along with flight engineer Soichi Noguchi also transferred the Express Rack 7 (ER7) to its final location. During the crews morning, a smoke alarm <b>sounded</b> <b>in</b> the Russian segment of the station, which prompted the joint crew to move into emergency procedures. However the alarm was false and was cleared {{within a couple of}} minutes and all normal work resumed. Mission specialists Clay Anderson, Rick Mastracchio and Stephanie Wilson conducted in-flight interviews with Nebraska Public Radio, CBS Newspath and Radio Network and KETV-TV in Omaha, Nebraska. Later in the day commander Alan Poindexter, pilot Jim Dutton and mission specialist Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger talked with students at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. At the end of the crews work day, the joint crew got together and reviewed the procedures for the second spacewalk. After the procedures review spacewalkers Clay Anderson and Rick Mastracchio entered the Quest airlock, closed the hatch and lowered the inside pressure to 10.2 psi. The pair also breathed pure oxygen for an hour while the pressure was being lowered.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight crew}} did not acquire any visual ground {{references}} before the approach was started. The aircraft started its final descent for landing too early. The aircraft had descended to 280 feet above ground when the terrain awareness and warning system <b>sounded</b> <b>in</b> the cockpit. The captain ordered a go-around and the autopilot was turned off. The first officer put {{the nose of}} the aircraft up for 4 seconds and the thrust levers were set to go-around power. The aircraft pitched up to 12.3° nose up and the flight crew raised the landing gear and flaps. Shortly thereafter the co-pilot started making nose down inputs which caused the aircraft to pitch-attitude to reduce to 3.5° nose down. (The co-pilot could have been focused on the aircraft's speed, rather than its altitude.) The go-around pitch attitude was not maintained and the instructions from the flight director were not followed. (The report says that fatigue could {{have played a role in}} causing the first officer to focus solely on the airspeed.) The captain and the first officer were making inputs to the aircraft's side stick at the same time (although the dual inputs were not sufficient to trigger a dual-input warning). This action appears to be intended to provide assistance by the captain to fly the aircraft. This action led to confusion on who was flying the aircraft. The ground proximity warning system sounded as the aircraft lost more height and the co-pilot responded with a sharp nose-down input. Then the captain took control of the aircraft without warning, via the side stick priority button and maintained the nose-down input, while the first officer was simultaneously pulling back on his own side stick. Two seconds before impact with the ground the aircraft was at 180 feet. The captain was also pulling his side stick fully back, suggesting both pilots were aware of the aircraft's impending collision with the ground.|$|E
