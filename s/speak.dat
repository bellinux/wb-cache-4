And there is also a negative correlation between <b>speaking</b> anxiety and each <b>speaking</b> ability subskills. The correlation coefficient between <b>speaking</b> anxiety and presentational English <b>speaking</b> performance is r= - 0. 914, p<. 01. Pearson correlation coefficient between <b>speaking</b> anxiety and <b>speaking</b> accuracy is r = - 0. 790, p<. 01, Pearson correlation coefficient between <b>speaking</b> anxiety and <b>speaking</b> fluency is r = - 0. 782, and Pearson correlation coefficient between <b>speaking</b> anxiety and <b>speaking</b> comprehensibility is r = - 0. 843. The more anxious the subject, the worse their presentational English <b>speaking</b> performance score and all <b>speaking</b> ability subskills’ score. 	Finally, it can be concluded that there is a strong negative correlation between <b>speaking</b> anxiety and presentational English <b>speaking</b> ability.
