40|$|Three new Coplanar Waveguide (CPW) {{transmission}} lines, namely, Suspended CPW (SCPW), Stripline-like Suspended CPW (SSCPW) and Inverted CPW (ICPW), {{are proposed}} and also analyzed for their propagation characteristics. The substrate thickness, permittivity and dimensions of housing {{are assumed to}} be arbitrary. These structures have the following advantages over conventional CPW. Firstly, the ratio of guide wavelength to free space wavelength is closer to unity which results in larger dimensions and hence lower tolerances. Secondly, the effective dielectric constant is lower and hence the electromagnetic field energies are concentrated more in the air regions which should reduce attenuation. Thirdly, for a prescribed impedance level, the above structures have a wider slot width for identical strip width. Thus, low impedance lines can be achieved with reasonable slot dimensions. Fourthly, in an inverted CPW <b>shunt</b> <b>mounting</b> of active devices, such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes, between the strip and the metal trough is possible. This feature further enhances the attractiveness of the above structures. Lastly, an E-plane probe type transition from a rectangular waveguide to suspended CPW can also be easily realized. The computed results for GaAs at Ka-band illustrate the variation of normalized guide wavelength, effective dielectric constant and the characteristic impedance as a function of the: (1) frequency; (2) distance of separation between the trough side walls; (3) normalized strip and slot widths; and (4) normalized air gap...|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} types of p-i-n diode, reflective CPW switches are presented. The first two switches are the series and the <b>shunt</b> <b>mounted</b> diode switches. Each has achieved greater than 15 dB of isolation over a broad bandwidth. The third switch is a narrow band, high isolation switched filter which has achieved 19 dB of isolation. Equivalent circuits and measured performance for each switch is presented...|$|R
40|$|GaAs {{superlattice}} PIN diodes {{with low}} forward resistance {{have been successfully}} fabricated using Molecular beam epitaxy. Static performance data for <b>shunt</b> <b>mounted</b> chips in a microstrip switch show a lower insertion loss at 9. 3 GHz over similar GaAs PIN diodes without the superlattice region. Dynamic switching experiments show both a switching speed and switching power advantage of GaAs superlattice PIN diodes over both GaAs and silicon PIN diodes...|$|R

40|$|Investigation {{into the}} {{limitations}} on the bandwidth of PIN diode switches in their different configurations is performed. The Single Pole Double Throw switch constructed with <b>shunt</b> <b>mounted</b> PIN diodes is shown to be bandlimited due to the line lengths involved in the operation. Series mounted diode switches have a wider bandwidth but the diodes cannot perform as power devices due to their physical construction. Radiation due to discontinuities were found to degrade the isolation but this was overcome by an evanescent waveguide structure. The software program TOUCHSTONE (TM) /RF by EEsof is used extensively as a basic development tool. The characterisation of the PIN diodes which {{was used by the}} software, was carried out. A bias network had to be developed to allow for the biasing of the diodes before any test boards could be fabricated. A literature survey was done on the different types of phase shifters available. A circuit which enables shifts in 45 degree increments was developed. The system consists of Reflection Phase Shifters which are made up of Quadrature Couplers that have different terminations switched in on two of their ports, a Wilkinson power splitter and a power combiner {{in the form of a}} 3 dB Quadrature Coupler. It was found that this configuration works well in theory but is too demanding on the practical components to allow for low phase shift errors to occur...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Circuit board <b>mounted,</b> <b>shunt</b> {{capacitive}} {{filters are}} less effective at high frequencies {{because of the}} mutual inductance (M) that exists between the input and output ports. An approximate expression for the mutual inductance is M = (µh/ 2 π) ln(h/a); where h = via length and a = radius of the via connecting the capacitor to the return plane. The reduced mutual inductance associated with the new, three-terminal, surface-mounted capacitor results in more than 15 dB increased attenuation compared to two-terminal capacitors over the 0. 3 – 6. 0 GHz range with 50 Ω source and load terminations. I...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, two Piezo-Based Rotating Inertial Actuators (PBRIAs) are {{considered}} for {{the suppression of the}} structure-borne noise radiated from rotating machinery. Each inertial actuator comprises a piezoelectric stack element shunted with the Antoniou’s gyrator circuit. This type of electrical circuit can be used to emulate a variable inductance. By varying the shunt inductance it is possible to realise two tuneable vibration neutralisers to suppress tonal frequency vibrations of a slowly rotating machine. Also, reductions in the noise radiated from the machine housing can be achieved. First a theoretical study is performed using a simplified lumped parameter model of the system at hand. The simplified model consists of a rotating shaft and two perpendicularly <b>mounted</b> <b>shunted</b> PBRIAs. Secondly, the shunted PBRIAs are tested on an experimental test bed comprising a rotating shaft mounted in a frame. The noise is radiated by a plate that is attached to the frame. The experimental results show that a reduction of 11 dB on the disturbance force transmitted from the rotating shaft through the bearing to the housing can be achieved. This also generates a reduction of 9 dB for the plate vibration and the radiated noise. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|As in {{many other}} industries, such as {{construction}} and agriculture, overhead electric power lines are a serious hazard at mining and mining-related operations. Even when excluding injuries that occur during electrical maintenance work, over one fourth of electrical fatalities in the mining industry are due to accidental overhead line contacts, and for each fatality nearly two serious non-fatal injuries occur due to such contacts. In incidents involving high-reaching mobile equipment, many of the victims touched the equipment after the fact, unaware that the machine frame had become energized by the line contact. MSHA data for accidents involving overhead power line contacts in the mining industry between 1980 and 1997 reveal that in 57 % of the cases personnel were unaware of the accidental line contact until after one or more workers touched the equipment or a hoisted load and were injured. The situation is similar in the construction industry, where according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) data at least 20 % of such victims are unaware of the line contact. This suggests that a device that alerts workers when a power line has been contacted could help prevent many of these injuries. Such a device would not prevent power line contacts, yet if widely employed could yield {{a significant reduction in}} the number of resulting injuries. Researchers at the NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory are attempting to develop such a device. The approach being investigated is based on measuring electric current flow to ground through a machine during a line contact. The specific technique being tested involves the diversion of some part of this current through a <b>shunt</b> cable <b>mounted</b> on board the machine, to provide a point at which to install a current sensor. Experiments thus far indicate that this approach is feasible. Ongoing research is better defining electric current flow through mobile equipment, refining techniques for measuring this current, and identifying factors that could limit the effectiveness of the proposed alarm...|$|R
40|$|The Aurizon (formerly QR National) Workshops in Rockhampton {{is a large}} rail heavy {{maintenance}} facility where the primary function is to repair and modify rollingstock. As the workshops are {{in close proximity to}} the Central Queensland coal fields most of the rollingstock presented are coal wagons and locomotives. Due to {{the fact that most of}} the rollingstock in the workshop yard is unpowered an external power source in the form of a rail <b>mounted</b> <b>shunt</b> vehicle is used to place the rollingstock in the desired location. The site has two shunt vehicles, a DN 300 and a DN 100. Both vehicles are designed for on road and on track operation. The on track operation is facilitated by the rubber road tyres contacting the track to provide traction with the on track guidance provided by hi-rail wheels front and rear. Both machines have derailed during normal operations heightening the risk of possible injury as well as causing major disruptions to production as the machine is quarantined for investigation following a derailment. Management are therefore very keen to try and establish a root cause of these derailments. The focus of this preliminary report is to provide an update on the investigations into the root causes of these derailments. ...|$|R
