Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial cells is important for negative <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell maturation and negative <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E
