40|$|The {{contributions}} of Cerenkov emission, luminescence, secondary electron emission, and bremsstrahlung to radiation-induced data current and noise of multiplier phototubes were analyzed quantitatively. Fluorescence and Cerenkov emission in the tube window {{are the major}} contributors and can quantitatively account for dark count levels observed in orbit. Radiation-induced noise can be minimized by <b>shielding,</b> <b>tube</b> selection, and mode of operation. Optical decoupling of windows and cathode (side-window tubes) leads to further reduction of radiation-induced dark counts, as does reducing the window thickness and effective cathode area, and selection of window/cathode combinations of low fluorescence efficiency. In trapped radiation-free regions of near-earth orbits and in free space, Cerenkov emission by relativistic particles contributes predominantly to the photoelectron yield per event. Operating multiplier phototubes in the photon (pulse) counting mode will discriminate against these large pulses and substantially reduce the dark count and noise to levels determined by fluorescence...|$|E
40|$|Beam pipes of high-energy superconducting {{colliders}} re-quire a <b>shielding</b> <b>tube</b> (liner) with pumping slots {{to screen}} cold chamber walls from synchrotron radiation. Pumping slots in the liner walls {{are required to}} keep high vacuum in-side the beam pipe and provide for a long beam lifetime. As previously discussed [Fedotov and Gluckstern, Phys. Rev. E 54, 1930 (1996) ], for a long narrow slot whose length may be comparable with the wavelength, the usual static approximation for the polarizability and susceptibil-ity which enter into the impedance is a poor one. [1] Our objective is eventually to analyze and obtain numerical val-ues for a rectangular slot of arbitrary dimensions. In this paper we present an analysis, based on a variational for-mulation, for the impedance of an annular cut in the inner conductor, including both the realistic coaxial structure of the beam-pipe {{and the effect of}} finite wavelength.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a measurement of temperature in a steelmaking furnace with an oxygen refining process, specifically in a tandem furnace. Knowledge of {{the temperature is}} important for optimizing the manufacturing process and extending {{of the life cycle}} of the inner furnace lining. Conditions in the furnace are very demanding; the temperature may temporarily exceed 2000 °C and exhibits changes of 60 °C s− 1. The atmosphere in the furnace is mainly oxidizing and its chemical composition is very variable. In the atmosphere there are also present liquid and solid compounds which act chemically and abrasively on the lining and on the sensor. These conditions make it impossible to use a suction pyrometer, contactless optical or acoustic measurement methods. It was decided to use a thermocouple in a protective tube. The sensor was inserted into the furnace through a steel bushing with water cooling. For the first measurement the type B thermocouple in Al 2 O 3 protective tube inside an outer <b>shielding</b> <b>tube</b> made from SiC was used. The second sensor used the type C thermocouple in a special thick-walled protective tube made from sintered SiC. The sensor does not measure the temperature of the gas itself, since it is affected by radiation of the surrounding areas. Conditions for heat transport from the furnace to the sensor are variable and difficult to determine; therefore, the accurate identification of the atmosphere temperature is not possible. Limit values of the temperature interval of the atmosphere were determined, for hypothetical cases of athermanous and ideally diathermic atmospheres. Web of Science 751039...|$|E

40|$|Since {{graphene}} (G) {{was first}} isolated by mechanical exfoliation [1], several {{methods have been}} explored for producing G, in order to exploit its extraordinary properties in many applications, including biomedical and biosensing ones. G preparation methods should be selected according to the specific sensing target and mechanism to be utilized, with a balanced consideration on performances (e. g., detection limit and dynamic range), reproducibility, cost and manufacturability. For {{a wide range of}} biomedical and biosensing applications, the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is considered to be the most promising approach to synthesize large-area, high-quality G, with material properties approaching the theoretical predictions. It is expected that CVD-G will exhibit fascinating electrochemical properties, including wide electrochemical potential windows and low charge-transfer resistance, which can enable the study and exploitation of redox-active biological processes from new perspectives. In our work, we investigate the fabrication of electrochemical biosensors in which G has the role of the transducer and the biosensing element is a redox-active membrane protein embedded in a supported lipid bilayer (SLB) mimicking the cell membrane (Fig. 1). In fact, membrane proteins maintain their functionalities only if they are embedded in their native environment, and so the integration of SLBs in such biosensors is a prerequisite for their functionality. [2] In order to provide a useful support for lipid bilayers, the G surface should be as clean and uniform as possible. In addition to altering significantly the G properties, contaminants generate defects in SLBs that compromise their fluidity and integrity. When using a traditional quartz tube furnace, heavy contaminations can be observed on G films grown by CVD on Cu substrates [3]. The contaminants are mainly SiO 2 clusters, deriving from the quartz walls when Cu atoms diffuse inside them. This effect is linked to the aging of the quartz tube, especially in the presence of oxidants, such as when using methane, ethanol, hydrogen and hydrocarbons. In order to reduce and avoid these contaminations, we designed a novel reactor, based on an alumina <b>shielding</b> <b>tube</b> placed coaxially in the quartz one. The G quality has been characterized both by SEM and by TEM equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Fig. 2 shows the SEM morphological observations of G grown using the old and the novel reactor setup. The G sample shown in Fig. 2 b is clearly free of all the contaminations appearing as white nanoparticles in Fig. 2 a. Fig. 3 shows a TEM image of a G layer with contaminants on the surface (black dots) and the EDX spectrum evidencing the presence of Si and O in such contaminants. In this work, results obtained for CVD-G synthesized using the novel reactor will be discussed in view of its potential application as a clean and smooth support for lipid bilayers in the fabrication of reliable electrochemical biosensors...|$|E

The NASA Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer (CPST) project {{is investigating the}} thermal and structural performance of this tank-applied integrated system. The MLI/BAC Shield Acoustic and Thermal Test was performed to evaluate the MLI/BAC shield's structural performance by subjecting it to worst-case launch acoustic loads. Identical thermal tests using Liquid Nitrogen (LN 2) were performed {{before and after the}} acoustic test. The data from these tests was compared to determine if any degradation occurred in the thermal performance of the system as a result of exposure to the acoustic loads. The thermal test series consisted of two primary components: a passive boil-off test to evaluate the MLI performance and an active cooling test to evaluate the integrated MLI/BAC shield system with chilled vapor circulating through the BAC <b>shield</b> <b>tubes.</b> The acoustic test used loads closely matching the worst-case envelope of all launch vehicles currently under consideration for CPST. Acoustic test results yielded reasonable responses for the given load. The thermal test matrix was completed prior to the acoustic test and successfully repeated after the acoustic test.
