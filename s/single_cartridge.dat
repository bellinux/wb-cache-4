5|$|Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles were {{originally}} planned {{as a single}} game. However, time was limited and the manufacturing costs of a 34-megabit cartridge with NVRAM would have been prohibitively expensive. Sonic Team split the game in half, giving the developers more time to finish the second part, and splitting the cost between two cartridges. The cartridge has {{a small amount of}} non-volatile RAM built into it, which allows the player to save game progress to the game cartridge. Sega planned to release a <b>single</b> <b>cartridge</b> version of both games titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Limited Edition, though it was eventually cancelled for unknown reasons; a prototype ROM image of this version was leaked in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The games {{interacted with}} each other: players could begin {{with any of}} the three titles and have the actions of the first game affect the story of the other two, a concept {{conceived}} by Okamoto. More than ten of Flagship's scenarists, among them Resident Evil writer Junichi Miyashita, worked simultaneously on the three stories. The developers considered using a cell phone adapter to transfer data, but later decided on a password system. The limitations of this system and the difficulty of coordinating three games proved too complicated, so the team scaled back to two titles at Miyamoto's suggestion. Condensing the games into a <b>single</b> <b>cartridge</b> was never considered, as the prospect of multiple endings and the added replay value afforded by the ability to play the titles in either order was very attractive. Oracle of Seasons was adapted from Mystical Seed of Power, Oracle of Ages was adapted from Mystical Seed of Wisdom, and Mystical Seed of Courage was canceled.|$|E
500|$|Critics praised Sonic & Knuckles, {{despite its}} {{similarity}} to its predecessor. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly named it their [...] "Game of the Month". They lauded the lock-on technology and remarked that despite that being [...] "more of the same, {{it still is}} an exceptional game." [...] A reviewer of GamePro, who gave it a perfect score, commented {{that the ability to}} play as Knuckles makes it essentially two games on a <b>single</b> <b>cartridge,</b> the game is more challenging than Sonic 3, and the ability to hook the cartridge up to Sonic 2 and 3 makes those games [...] "worth playing again." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the success}} of Advance Wars; Intelligent Systems, the company that created the {{original}} game, began designing a sequel to Advance Wars. It was originally announced on January 15, 2003 under the title Advance Wars 2 {{to be released in}} North America in June of that year. [...] was to conduct testing, and Nintendo would publish the game. As Advance Wars was not released in Japan, Black Hole Rising was also unreleased in Japan, despite the fact the games were developed there. Later, before the launch of , the games were released in Japan on a <b>single</b> <b>cartridge,</b> Game Boy Wars Advance 1+2 for the Game Boy Advance as well as the GBA game for the Wii U Virtual Console, which contained both of the games. The Japanese release had minor graphical differences, mostly in the portraits of the commanding officers.|$|E

50|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} Krag-Jørgensen action was its magazine. While many other rifles of its era used an integral box magazine loaded by a charger or stripper clip, the magazine of the Krag-Jørgensen was integral with the receiver (the part of the rifle that houses the operating parts), featuring an opening on the right hand side with a hinged cover. Instead of a charger, <b>single</b> <b>cartridges</b> were inserted through the side opening, and were pushed up, around, and into the action by a spring follower.|$|R
60|$|Again Venters began {{slipping}} fresh cartridges {{into the}} magazine of his rifle, {{and his hand}} was so sure and steady {{that he did not}} drop a <b>single</b> <b>cartridge.</b> With the eye of a rider and the judgment of a marksman he once more measured the distance between him and Jerry Card. Wrangle had gained, bringing him into rifle range. Venters was hard put to it now not to shoot, but thought it better to withhold his fire. Jerry, who, in anticipation of a running fusillade, had huddled himself into a little twisted ball on Black Star's neck, now surmising that this pursuer would make sure of not wounding one of the blacks, rose to his natural seat in the saddle.|$|E
60|$|The {{revolution}} had all {{the character}} of a popular movement. Many of the high chiefs were detained in Mulinuu; the commons trooped to the bush under inferior leaders. A camp was chosen near Faleula, threatening Mulinuu, well placed for the arrival of recruits and close to a German plantation from which the force could be subsisted. Manono came, all Tuamasanga, much of Savaii, and part of Aana, Tamasese's own government and titular seat. Both sides were arming. It was a brave day for the trader, though not so brave as some that followed, when a <b>single</b> <b>cartridge</b> {{is said to have been}} sold for twelve cents currency--between nine and ten cents gold. Yet even among the traders a strong party feeling reigned, and it was the common practice to ask a purchaser upon which side he meant to fight.|$|E
6000|$|Neither {{have the}} Gardes Francaises, the best {{regiment}} of the line, shown any promptitude for street-firing lately. They returned grumbling from Reveillon's; {{and have not}} burnt a <b>single</b> <b>cartridge</b> since; nay, as we saw, not even when bid. A dangerous humour dwells in these Gardes. Notable men too, in their way! Valadi the Pythagorean was, at one time, an officer of theirs. Nay, in the ranks, under the three-cornered felt and cockade, what hard heads may there not be, and reflections going on,--unknown to the public! One head of the hardest we do now discern there: {{on the shoulders of}} a certain Sergeant Hoche. Lazare Hoche, that is the name of him; he used to be about the Versailles Royal Stables, nephew of a poor herbwoman; a handy lad; exceedingly addicted to reading. He is now Sergeant Hoche, and can rise no farther: he lays out his pay in rushlights, and cheap editions of books. (Dictionnaire des Hommes Marquans, Londres (Paris), 1800, ii. 198.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{original}} Pattern 1913 Enfield action being designed around the high-powered [...]276 Enfield experimental cartridge with a larger diameter case than the [...]303 British, the internal box magazine capacity for the smaller diameter [...]303 British was six rounds, although the employed stripper clips held only five cartridges. The Pattern 1914 Enfield like the Mauser Gewehr 98 had no magazine cut-off mechanism, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of <b>single</b> <b>cartridges</b> only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve.|$|R
50|$|When the Ottoman Army {{learned about}} the new Spanish model of 1893, it ordered some 200,000 rifles in the same configuration. Their rifles were {{chambered}} for the 7.65×53mm Argentine cartridge and were identical to the Spanish model, except for a unique cartridge feed interruptor or magazine cut-off, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of <b>single</b> <b>cartridges</b> only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve, which permitted the feeding of <b>single</b> <b>cartridges</b> while keeping the magazine fully loaded. What distinguished the original 1893 and subsequent 1903 Ottoman Mauser was its tangent rear sight calibrated from 200 to 2,000 meters, which was represented not by Arabic numerals like virtually all other rifles, but instead by Eastern Arabic numerals; these numerals would also be used on future Persian Mauser rifles and carbines. Later (and most manufactured throughout the decades of production) Turkish Mauser rifles produced were fitted with rear sights calibrated in standard Arabic numerals. By the late 1930s, most all of these original rifles still in Turkish hands were re-barreled and converted to fire the far more common and powerful 8mm Mauser. Even so, this remains a distinguishing feature of the few authentic 1893/1903 Ottoman Mauser rifles—the ones still chambered in 7.65mm Argentine—still in existence from that period.|$|R

60|$|One puzzling {{thing that}} could not be {{explained}} away was the conduct of the troopers with their exploding rifles. It seemed impossible that they should be in the plot, yet there were the hundreds their flying bullets had slain, including the King and Queen. On the other hand, more baffling than ever was the fact that seventy per cent. of the troopers themselves had been killed or wounded. Some explained this on the ground that the loyal foot-soldiers, witnessing the attack on the royal carriage, had opened fire on the traitors. Yet not one bit of evidence to verify this could be drawn from the survivors, though many were put to the torture. They contended stubbornly that they had not discharged their rifles at all, but that their rifles had discharged themselves. They were laughed at by the chemists, who held that, while it was just barely probable that a <b>single</b> <b>cartridge,</b> charged with the new smokeless powder, might spontaneously explode, it was beyond all probability and possibility for all the cartridges in a given area, so charged, spontaneously to explode. And so, in the end, no explanation of the amazing occurrence was reached. The general opinion {{of the rest of the}} world was that the whole affair was a blind panic of the feverish Latins, precipitated, it was true, by the bursting of two terrorist bombs; and in this connection was recalled the laughable encounter of long years before between the Russian fleet and the English fishing boats.|$|E

2500|$|When {{specifying the}} {{requirements}} for its new service rifle, the Navy emphasized that it desired a repeating rifle loaded by means of chargers or clips, but [...] "since the conditions of service may {{require the use of}} loose cartridges, or may result in the disabling of the magazine, it is desirable that the small arm be susceptible of use as a single loader, and that the magazine be capable of being replenished by <b>single</b> <b>cartridges.</b> [...] The new Lee rifle and its magazine met all of these requirements, enabling a rifleman in an emergency to use the loose cartridges taken from loaded belts supplied to machine gun crews for the 6mm Colt–Browning machine gun.|$|R

50|$|Contrary to {{widespread}} misconception, partially expended or full clips {{can be easily}} ejected from the rifle {{by means of the}} clip latch button. It is also possible to load <b>single</b> <b>cartridges</b> into a partially loaded clip while the clip is still in the magazine, but this requires both hands and a bit of practice. In reality, this procedure was rarely performed in combat, as the danger of loading dirt along with the cartridges increased the chances of malfunction. Instead, it was much easier and quicker to simply manually eject the clip, and insert a fresh one, which is how the rifle was originally designed to be operated. Later, special clips holding two or five rounds became available on the civilian market, as well as a single-loading device which stays in the rifle when the bolt locks back.|$|R
