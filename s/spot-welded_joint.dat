This paper presents an integrated approach combining simulation of the welding process, materials characterisation and mechanical modelling to study the effect of welding parameters {{on the strength of}} <b>spot-welded</b> <b>joints.</b> The welding process was simulated and the dimensional attributes were used to build the mechanical models for strength analysis. The constitutive material properties of the base, nugget and the heat-affected-zone (HAZ) were determined by an inverse FE modelling approach using indentation test data. The predicted deformation of <b>spot-welded</b> <b>joints</b> of a typical automotive steel under tensile-shear load showed a good agreement with experimental results.

40|$|Spot-welded joints {{are widely}} {{employed}} {{in the construction of}} vehicle structures. Recently, due to the strategies for minimizing the fuel consumption and vehicle emissions, more and more applications of lightweight materials, such as aluminum (Al) alloys, are employed in spot-welded joints. Hence, a universal and simple fatigue life prediction method is needed for conventional steel spot-welded joints as well as mixed materials spot-welded joints. In this study, a new notch stress approach is developed for fatigue life evaluation of the <b>spot-welded</b> <b>joint.</b> The idea of this method originates from Rupp’s structural stress method, which has been successfully used in automotive industry. The structural stress method is simple enough, but there are nine parameters needed to be adjusted for each new experimental data. Thus, the primary goal of the new approach is to eliminate the troublesome parameters. Stress intensity factors SIFs and stress concentration factors are introduced to solve this issue. Then, having considered the boundary conditions and crack propagation effects, some correction factors are applied to the new notch stress approach in this study. Finally, three groups of spot weld fatigue data including steel, aluminum alloys and their combination are processed with the new notch stress approach for validation. Compared with Rupp’s structural stress method, distinct improvements are presented in this study...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Resistance {{spot welding}} (RSW) is vastly used in {{automobile}} industries to cut weight {{and lower the}} cost. It is necessary to improve ultimate strength of <b>spot-welded</b> <b>joints</b> for safety of automotive. The Spot weld joints provide localized connection which leads to high stress concentration in the joined plates. Also due to improper design excessive stresses and premature failure occurs in joined plates. A designer should have concentration {{on the strength of}} component by introducing the changes in its geometry and weld patterns that will reduce the vibration and noise of the structural models. Also increases the strength of the structures. The optimum design of geometry and weld patterns will give optimal performance i. e. good strength to the composed structures.

This applies in particular to high-strength steel and advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) joining of thin sheet steel components for lightweight body shell structures. Joining of AHSS in mass production might lead to weld discontinuities under certain circumstances. Those discontinuities in form of cracks might be an initial start of cracking in the <b>spot-welded</b> <b>joints</b> regarding fatigue loads.

The fracture parameters (characteristic strength and toughness) associated with the shear and normal modes of ductile fracture in thin aluminum alloy coupons were determined by comparing experimental observations to numerical simulations in which a cohesive-fracture zone was embedded within a continuum representation of the sheet metal.

40|$|Joining of {{components}} with structural adhesives is currently {{one of the}} most widespread techniques for advanced structures (e. g., aerospace or aeronautical). Adhesive bonding does not involve drilling operations and it distributes the load over a larger area than mechanical joints. However, peak stresses tend to develop near the overlap edges because of differential straining of the adherends and load asymmetry. As a result, premature failures can be expected, especially for brittle adhesives. Moreover, bonded joints are very sensitive to the surface treatment of the material, service temperature, humidity and ageing. To surpass these limitations, the combination of adhesive bonding with spot-welding is a choice to be considered, adding a few advantages like superior static strength and stiffness, higher peeling and fatigue strength and easier fabrication, as fixtures during the adhesive curing are not needed. The experimental and numerical study presented here evaluates hybrid spot-welded/bonded single-lap joints in comparison with the purely spot-welded and bonded equivalents.

Next, three dimensional finite element model based on the experimental observations of dominate fatigue kinked crack angle and the crack path was used for simulating the fatigue crack in the spot welded joints. The linear elastic fracture mechanics approach was used to obtain the local stress intensity factors related to fracture modes I and II in the crack tip. Fatigue crack growth life was estimated using the Walker equation. Finally, the total fatigue life of spot welded joint was obtained from the summation of fatigue crack initiation and propagation phases. To have a confirmation, the numerical predictions of total fatigue life of spot welded joints have been compared with the available experimental fatigue test data. The results showed that there was a very good agreement between theoretical propagation and experimental values of total fatigue lifetime.

A series of laboratory experiments was conducted to assess the feasibility of thermographic and acoustic methods for evaluating the quality of individual spot welds and the structural integrity of <b>spot-welded</b> and weld-bonded <b>joints.</b> Emphasis was placed on identifying structurally weak “stick” welds, which are much more difficult to detect than broken welds. After nondestructive evaluation, the samples were subjected to mechanical tests to determine the strength of individual spot welds. Analytical and numerical models are also being developed to help interpret results of the laboratory experiments. The insight gained from the data and modeling results are essential in moving from qualitative techniques that identify flaws to quantitative methods that assess the severity of defects...|$|R
