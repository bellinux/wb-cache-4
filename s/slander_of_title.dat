25|$|In October 1993, Novell, {{the company}} that owned {{the rights to the}} Unix System V source at the time, {{transferred}} the trademarks of Unix to the X/Open Company (now The Open Group), and in 1995 sold the related business operations to Santa Cruz Operation (SCO). Whether Novell also sold the copyrights to the actual software {{was the subject of a}} 2006 federal lawsuit, SCO v. Novell, which Novell won. The case was appealed, but on August 30, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the trial decisions, closing the case. Unix vendor SCO Group Inc. accused Novell of <b>slander</b> <b>of</b> <b>title.</b>|$|E
25|$|SCO {{filed an}} amended complaint. In late July, 2005, Novell filed {{an answer to}} SCO's complaint, denying all of its accusations. Novell also filed its own <b>Slander</b> <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> counter-lawsuit against SCO. Novell has also filed claims for {{numerous}} breaches of the APA (Asset Purchase Agreement) between Novell and the Santa Cruz Operation. Under the APA, Santa Cruz (and later SCO after SCO purchased Santa Cruz Operation's Unix Business) was given the right to market and sell Unixware as a product, retaining 100% of all revenues. Santa Cruz Operation (and later SCO) also was given the responsibility of administering Unix SVR4 license agreements on behalf of Novell. When money was paid for licensing, SCO was to turn over 100% of the revenue to Novell, and then Novell would return 5% as an Administration Fee. Novell claims that SCO signed Unix SVR4 licensing agreements with Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, {{as well as with}} numerous Linux End Users for Unix IP allegedly in the Linux Kernel, and then refused to turn the money over to Novell. Novell is suing for 100% of the revenue, claiming SCO is not entitled to the 5% administration fee since they breached their contract with Novell. Novell's counterclaims proposed asking the court to put appropriate funds from SCO into escrow until the case is resolved, since SCO's cash is diminishing quickly.|$|E
2500|$|SCO v. Novell was a United States {{lawsuit in}} which The SCO Group (SCO) claimed {{ownership}} of the source code for the Unix operating system, including portions of Linux. [...] SCO sought to have the court declare that SCO owned {{the rights to the}} Unix code, including the copyrights, and that Novell had committed <b>slander</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> by claiming those rights for itself.|$|E

2500|$|The {{jury trial}} on the remanded {{copyright}} issues began on March 8, 2010 before Judge Ted Stewart. [...] It {{was expected to}} last three weeks. On March 30, the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of Novell. [...] On June 10, Judge Stewart {{ruled in favor of}} Novell on all issues, closing the case. [...] The court found that Novell had not committed <b>slander</b> <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> was not now required to transfer the copyrights under the APA, that its copyright waivers issued to IBM were authorized, and that they did not violate the covenant of good faith.|$|E
2500|$|On July 29, 2005, Novell filed a counter-suit against SCO {{claiming}} <b>slander</b> <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> {{breach of}} contract, failure to remit royalties, {{and failure to}} conduct audit obligations. Novell sought damages in excess of SCO's net worth, and, as SCO was quickly burning through its assets and cash on hand, Novell {{asked the court to}} sequester this money from SCO so {{that it would not be}} spent before the resolution of the case. Novell also asked the court to attach SCO's assets pending adjudication of their claims. Had Novell won this motion, SCO would have been forced to file for bankruptcy. Novell accused SCO of licensing Unix System V Release 4 to Microsoft and Sun Microsystems without then sending Novell the one hundred percent of the license fees as required by the APA. (Novell would then have been obligated to pay SCO five percent of the license fees as an administration fee, but only after SCO had sent the money to Novell first.) ...|$|E

50|$|In law, <b>slander</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> is {{normally}} a claim involving {{real estate in}} which one entity falsely claims to own another entity's property.

Novell case). <b>Slander</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> {{is a form of}} jactitation.|$|E
