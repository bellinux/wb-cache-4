5000|$|Microfoam is milk foamed using a <b>steam</b> <b>wand</b> on an espresso machine, {{used for}} making espresso-based coffee drinks, {{particularly}} those with latte art.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{technique}} for cooking creamy scrambled eggs is to pipe steam into eggs with butter via a <b>steam</b> <b>wand</b> (as found on an espresso machine).|$|E
5000|$|Coffee is {{typically}} served after pouring {{back and forth}} between the dabara and the tumbler in huge arc-like motions of the hand. This serves several purposes: mixing the ingredients (including sugar) thoroughly; cooling the hot coffee down to a sipping temperature; and most importantly, aerating the mix without introducing extra water (such as with a <b>steam</b> <b>wand</b> used for frothing cappucinos). An anecdote related to the distance between the pouring and receiving cup leads to another name for the drink, [...] "Meter Coffee".|$|E
50|$|Single boiler (SB): These {{machines}} can brew only, and not steam, requiring only {{a single}} boiler. They are relatively uncommon, with <b>steam</b> <b>wands</b> being a simple and valued addition.|$|R
5000|$|The Strada AV {{prototype}} {{is introduced}} in 2015 and launched in 2016, featuring Italian design and user-friendly interface. The Strada AV is for customers who appreciate {{the familiarity of}} volumetric controls and who seek repeatability and consistency in high-volume settings, presenting the most stable brewing platform thanks to the thermal stability system and individual coffee boilers. The Strada machine, with the AV model, is equipped {{for the very first}} time with High Performance <b>Steam</b> <b>Wands.</b>|$|R
50|$|Single boiler, {{dual use}} (SB/DU): Some home pump espresso {{machines}} use a single chamber both to heat water to brewing temperature and to boil water for steaming milk. However, they can perform only one operation at a time, requiring a warm up {{period between the}} execution of espresso pull and the milk frothing process. Since the temperature for brewing {{is less than the}} temperature for creating steam the machine requires time to make the transition from one mode to the other. SB/DUs are generally found within the lower tiers of enthusiast home models, with <b>steam</b> <b>wands</b> being a simple and valued addition.|$|R
50|$|The Verismo 801 was a superautomatic {{coffee machine}} {{designed}} exclusively for Starbucks, until discontinued in 2008. The Verismo 801 was {{released to the}} commercial market shortly before it's discontinuation under the Black and White CTS2 brand name. It features dual bean hoppers and is capable of pulling both single, double and half-caff espresso. It has also a <b>steam</b> <b>wand</b> with automatic temperature probe (for programmable auto-shutoff), and hot water spout. All functions are operated by the button control panel {{on the front of}} the device.|$|E
50|$|Cappuccino is {{a coffee}} drink that today is {{composed}} of double espresso and hot milk, with the surface topped with foamed milk. Cappuccinos are most often prepared with an espresso machine. The double espresso is poured {{into the bottom of}} the cup, followed by a similar amount of hot milk, which is prepared by heating and texturing the milk using the espresso machine <b>steam</b> <b>wand.</b> The top third of the drink consists of milk foam; this foam can be decorated with artistic drawings made with the same milk, called latte art.|$|E
5000|$|An espresso machine brews coffee {{by forcing}} {{pressurized}} water near boiling point through a [...] "puck" [...] of ground {{coffee and a}} filter {{in order to produce}} a thick, concentrated coffee called espresso. The first machine for making espresso was built and patented in 1884 by Angelo Moriondo of Turin, Italy. An improved design was patented on April 28, 1903, by Luigi Bezzera. Patent no: US726793 A, which was bought by the founder of the La Pavoni company which from 1905 produced espresso machines commercially on a small scale in Milan. Multiple machine designs have been created to produce espresso. Several machines share some common elements, such as a grouphead and a portafilter. An espresso machine may also have a <b>steam</b> <b>wand</b> which is used to steam and froth liquids, to include milk, for coffee drinks such as cappuccino and caffe latte.|$|E
50|$|The {{hot water}} can be drawn {{directly}} from the same espresso machine {{that is used to}} brew the espresso, or from a separate water heater or kettle. Using the same heater is convenient, particularly at home, not needing a separate heater, and the water can in fact be drawn directly into the glass, either before or after pulling the shot of espresso. Some espresso machines have a separate hot water spout for this purpose, while others allow the use of the <b>steam</b> <b>wand</b> for dispensing hot water. Using a separate water heater is more practical in a commercial setting, as it reduces the demands on the espresso machine, both not disrupting the temperature of the brew water and allowing an inexpensive water heater to be used for hot water, rather than the substantially more complicated espresso machine.|$|E
