5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast {{to have very}} demanding system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower than what is recommended, albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed <b>slightly</b> <b>to</b> reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe the effects that are seen in a different manner.|$|E

50|$|Glassfish {{have been}} kept in {{aquarium}} for many years, but {{have a reputation for}} being delicate and difficult to keep.

5|$|The Green is not {{perfectly}} rectangular, as {{its southern}} border along Wheelock Street runs <b>slightly</b> <b>to</b> the northeast rather than due east-west.
