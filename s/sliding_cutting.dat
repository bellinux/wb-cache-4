40|$|Keywords : Load - soil interaction, soil structure, soil {{mechanical}} properties, FEM (Finite Element Method), Plaxis (Finite Element Code), granular particles, shear stress, DEM (Distinct Element Method), micromechanics of deformation, interparticle {{friction coefficient}} For researchers concerned with soil compaction, soil structure is assessed by indirect measurement of parameters related to soil mechanical properties. In this study the mechanical properties of soil are investigated for the dynamic load - soil interaction of tyre - soil systems, tool penetration, shearing and soil cutting by a pendulum type machine. The methods selected for analyses are the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Distinct Element Method (DEM). The dynamic module of Plaxis (a special purpose finite element program released in 2000), is {{more advanced than}} the previous version of Plaxis. In Plaxis calculations, the Mohr - Coulomb model is selected for deformable soil and the Cam - Clay type model is selected for compactable soil properties. Results of these model studies are presented briefly for the above load - soil interactions. Although the dynamic module of Plaxis performs better, the problems of analysing the discontinuous properties of soil such as shearing (<b>sliding),</b> <b>cutting</b> and cracking (fracturing) still remain unsolved due to the continuous nature of the medium. In such cases, representing soil as a discontinuous medium as in DEM is more realistic. In DEM, soil is an assembly of discrete particles (discontinuous medium) {{with the possibility of}} cyclic contact and failure, by updating contact interactions throughout the simulation. The appropriate models selected are: the original DEM for cohesionless particles and the modified Kyoto DEM in which the adhesion force between particles is considered. The simulation results show that the mechanical properties of the particles are dependent on the micromechanics of deformation. Shear stress and failure appear largely to be influenced by interparticle sliding and rolling. Sliding contacts are always greater for the low values of interparticle friction coefficient. If this value is sufficiently high, especially for coarse and medium granular particles sliding will be very low and rolling of particles dominates the system which results in low shear stress values. Moreover the contact stiffness and the particle size have an important influence on the deformation mechanisms. For instance, for coarse and medium granular particles, soft stiffness shows compaction whereas hard stiffness shows dilatancy during the shearing process. In the simulation of soil cutting by a pendulum type machine adhesive particles are displaced more or less together by forming soil clods. The deformation behaviour of particles and the crack propagation during the cutting process are significantly affected by the adhesion coefficient between particles, the interparticle friction coefficient and the particle size. In our simulation, parameter analyses were performed by varying the most relevant model inputs. Normal and tangential stiffness between particles, interparticle friction coefficient, adhesion coefficient between particles and particle size {{turned out to be the}} most influential input parameters. Finally results from this simulation are qualitatively compared with those of Plaxis and also some similar laboratory test results reviewed from literature are selected for benchmarking. By evaluating the model results using comparisons, the potential capability of the DEM model on showing the actual soil properties during the above load - soil interaction could be approved...|$|E

The MDTB data acquisition system is capable of recording (using PC-LabWindows) transitional run-to-failure data sets from a variety of commensurate and non-commensurate (vibration, oil, temperature, and acoustic emission) sensors. Off-line JOAP oil analysis results (ferrography) for samples collected from industrial grade (off-the-shelf) single-pair helical gearboxes subjected to sustained output loads of 2 - 3 times their rated maximum torque are presented. The off-line oil ferrography results indicated a much higher <b>sliding</b> and <b>cutting</b> wear particle content for the higher loaded (3 X maximum torque) experiments.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{key features}} of a recently uncovered mode of plastic flow sinuous flow with vortex like components on the mesoscale. Based on high-resolution, in situ imaging of a hard wedge (asperity) sliding against a metal surface, we contrast this flow with the more well-known smooth homogeneous (laminar) flow in wear and large strain deformation processes. Sinuous flow is characterized by folding, and arises in both pure <b>sliding</b> and <b>cutting</b> of metals with large strain hardening capacity. The folds mediating the flow can transform into wear particles and surface defects by delamination via fold splitting. Examples of this occurrence have been captured in situ, by high speed imaging of the sliding contact. This provides a direct mechanism for delamination wear, {{in just a few}} passes of sliding. Material heterogeneity {{plays an important role in}} the folding, as revealed by finite element simulation and experiment. This combined experiment-simulation approach reveals a number of ways in which folding can be triggered, suggesting an important role for sinuous flow in delamination wear. A close relationship between sinuous flow and mechanochemical Rehbinder effects in machining of metals is also highlighted. Technological implications of sinuous flow for sliding wear and manufacturing processes are briefly discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Numbers of wear models studies predicting the tool life length have been created throughout the metal-cutting history to better predict and thereby control the tool life span, which is a major portion of the total cost of machining.   A geometrical contact model defining the geometry of the flank wear growth on the cutting tool inserts was proposed and then compared with four suggested models, which estimates flank wear.

This thesis used for the first time borehole cuttings data from the well DEL- 03. DEL- 03 is less then one kilometer away from the proposed drill site.

With the use of thin <b>slides</b> of the <b>cuttings</b> of DEL- 03 a sedimentary analysis has been made using a polarizing microscope. It goes more deeply into mineralogical content and cement types. Examination of the cuttings with fluorescent light and chloroform proved the absence of residual bitumen, which is a needed for the production of hot water. Also a grain size analysis has been made which was inconclusive. The content of sandstone in the borehole cuttings analysis does not correspond with the results of the spontaneous potential log of DEL- 03.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research work {{is to develop a}} simulation procedure for modeling the soil-tool interaction for a blade of arbitrary shape. The primary motivation for this study is developing agricultural robots with limited power and pulling force to help farmers in crop production. In this thesis, a finite element (FE) investigation of soil-blade interaction is presented. The soil is considered as an elastic-plastic material with the non-associated Drucker-Prager constitutive law. A separation procedure to model the cutting of soil and a method of calculating the forces acting on the blade are proposed and discussed in detail. The procedure uses a separation criterion that becomes active at consecutive nodes on the predefined separation surfaces. In order to mimic soil-blade <b>sliding</b> and soil-soil <b>cutting</b> phenomena contact elements with different properties are applied. To verify correctness of the FE model developed and the procedures used, the FE results are first compared with analytical results available for straight rectangular blades from classical soil mechanics theories; and then the FE results are compared with the experimental ones. Also the effects of blade width, depth and rake angle on blade’s draft force were studied by simulating soil-blade interaction with different blade’s dimensions. After the analytical and experimental validation of the results for straight rectangular blade, the rectangular curved shape blade was modeled in order to investigate the effects of changing the blade’s radius of curvature on the blade’s draft force. The soil interaction with straight triangular blade in different rake angles was simulated next. Since the analytical solutions are limited to rectangular blades, calculated draft forces for triangular blade were verified only experimentally. The triangular and rectangular blades with the same width and depth of interaction were also investigated. The results showed that triangular blade draft force is around half of the amount of force acting on the rectangular blade with the same rake angle. Also the effect of triangular blade’s sharpness and changing the blade’s radius of curvature on draft force was discussed. By changing the blade’s sharpness, the draft forces of triangular blade were calculated in two conditions of constant blade’s width and constant blade’s contact length. The approach presented in this thesis can be used to investigate the soil-tool interactions for real and more complex blade geometries and soil conditions, and ultimately for improving design of blades to be used in tillage operations...|$|R

During and after the last ice age, up to several hundred metres of glaciomarine and marine deposits accumulated in Norwegian fjords. These sediments were subsequently exposed on land due to glacioisostatic rebound. Leaching of salt from the marine clay by groundwater resulted in the development of quick-clay layers or pockets, which completely liquefy when remoulded. The study area of this thesis is the small valley Buvika, located in the Trondheimsfjorden area, Mid Norway. Buvika is characterised by its undulating terrain with numerous slide scars and ravines. There are thick occurrences of quick clay in the subsurface. The existing geotechnical and geophysical data, combined with sedimentology, structural geology, morphology, geophysical results, and 14 C-datings, have given input {{to the understanding of the}} landscape development of the study area. From this, a deglaciation history has been deduced, indicating at least one, and possibly two, minor glacier re-advances in Late Allerød/Early Younger Dryas time. This implies that there have been more and larger ice-front oscillations in the study area than earlier documented. The lowered relative sea level led to incision by rivers accompanied by numerous slides involving quick clay. The erosion pattern of a valley filled with glaciomarine and marine deposits can be quite complex, but careful analyses have helped outlining the interplay between river and ravine incision, groundwater erosion and sliding. The study of sediments and structures in large excavated sections have resulted in the detection of slide material from old flake-type slides, where only a thin layer of quick clay acted as a slide plane. Younger <b>slide</b> scars <b>cutting</b> into theses older slide deposits show further quick-clay development. Mapping of the morphology in Buvika has identified numerous slide scars and ravines. A relative chronology of slide events has been established based upon the slide scars’ position in the terrain and/or results from 14 C-datings of terrestrial organic material. Most of the historical slide scars are located in the northern part of the valley. Detailed mapping of the quick-clay extent is of great interest for planning and protection purposes, as the position of quick clay within slopes has a major impact on the landslide risk. In this study, the resistivity method is found to be potentially well suited for outlining quick-clay occurrences since quick clay has a slightly higher electrical resistivity (10 - 80 Ωm) than intact unleached clay (1 - 10 Ωm). This is due to a higher salt content in the latter. These relationships are supported by pore water salt content measurements. The resistivity profiles that were acquired show good correlation with other geophysical data and geotechnical drillings. However, the resistivity method must be combined with other investigations, since both leached, non-quick clay and silty, non-sensitive material may give resistivity values of the same range as quick clay. The stratigraphy of an area strongly influences the landscape development. It determines the morphology, such as ravine development, and size, shape and distribution of slides. To the east of Buvika, thick and frequent layers of sand and gravel in the dominant clay deposits drain the slopes, leading to development of deeply incising ravines. To the south and north, thinner layers of coarse material in the clay lead to pore-pressure build-ups and quick-clay development, resulting in numerous slide scars.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{forest vegetation}} {{study was conducted}} in 40 stands from Astore, Gilgit and Skardu three districts of Gilgit-Baltistan. The arboreal vegetation was analyzed using point centered quarter method while understory was sampled using circular quadrates. On the basis of phytosociological analysis following 5 communities of mixed tree species and 5 pure stands were recognized on the basis of importance value. 1) Pinus wallichiana-Juniperus community, 2) Pinus wallichiana Betula community, 3) Picea-Juniperus community, 4) Picea-Pinus wallichiana, 5) Pinus wallichiana-Pinus gerardiana community, 1) Picea smithiana pure stands, 2) Pinus wallichiana pure stands, 3) Betula pure stands, 4) Juniperus macropoda pure stand and 5) Abies pindrow pure stand. Eighty three plants species of various herbs, shrubs and seedlings of trees were observed and identified on the forest floor. Among the understory vegetation Thymus serpyllum (2. 8 - 18 %), Fragaria nubicola (3. 8 - 17. 5 %), Leontopodium leontopodinum (3. 7 - 17. 1 %), Bergenia stracheyi (1. 5 - 16. 1 %), Artemisia brevifolia (2. 7 - 15. 3 %), Bistorta affinis (2. 2 - 15. 1 %), Tanacetum artemisioides (1. 2 - 15. 2 %), Thymus linearis (6. 2 - 15. 1 %), Geranium wallichianum (6 - 15 %), Leontopodium himalayanum (3 - 14. 9 %) were abundantly distributed with the range of relative frequency respectively. Dbh size classes of each stand as well as overall size class of four dominant species i. e. Pinus wallichiana, Picea smithiana, Juniperus excelsa and Betula utilis were studied. Size class showed varied distribution patterns in different stands. Most of the deviation from an ideal distribution may be explained in terms of anthropogenic disturbances, i. e. grazing, <b>cutting,</b> <b>sliding,</b> burning and other human induced factors. Therefore, these forests {{do not appear to be}} in stable condition. It is concluded that if prompt action is not taken to stop current damaging practices, these valuable forests will vanish in a few decades. Wardâ€™s cluster analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to investigate the relationships between soil properties and vegetation. Sixteen soil characteristics and Importance value index were taken in case of tree vegetation while in case of understory vegetation frequency of species was used to investigate the distribution pattern of vegetation. Based on Wardâ€™s cluster analysis seven groups were identified from tree vegetation data and six groups were recognized in case of understory flora. These groups clearly showed the distinct species composition and associated environmental (soil) characteristics. Relationship between vegetation and topographic factors was also studied. Wardâ€™s cluster analysis and Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) were applied to seek the vegetation distribution and composition. The groups of tree and understory vegetation could be readily superimposed on DCA ordination plane. Classification and ordination showed similar distribution pattern of tree species as well as understory vegetation thereby complementing the results of each other. Modern Dendrochronological methods were applied to analyze growth rates and age estimation of Pinus wallichiana A. B. Jackson (blue pine) from the forest of Ganji valley Himalayan range of Pakistan. Twenty eight cores from 14 trees were obtained to determine age and growth rates. Pinus wallichiana showed mean age of 173 years while highest (363 years) age was recorded from 70 cm Dbh tree. The mean growth rate observed in this species ranged from 3 to 15 year/cm in case of trees while in case of seedlings showed 0. 8 to 2 while correlation between Dbh and age was significant. Correlation between age and growth rate in case of seedling found significant while in case of tree it was not significant. Dbh and age were found significant in both cases. Growth rates in every ten years interval from 1720 to 2010 also estimated. It is concluded that growth rate is gradually not significantly on every 10 year basis, however each period is significantly differs 40 to 50 years. Seedling in the past period also show that the vegetation is deteriorating with the passage of time, therefore a special attention is required to save these forests. These important forests exist under anthropogenic threat and environmental disturbances. Some of them may easily be managed as indicated by the presence of large number of seedling. However stands with paucity of seedlings shall need more serious attention. In addition ring-width chronology of 211 years (AD 1730 - 2010) was developed. Chronology statistics showed that Pinus wallichiana have the past climate signal. Strong correlation has been observed between tree growth and previous November temperature and July indicating that winter warmth is the main factor responsible for tree growth. Correlation analysis between tree ring chronology and grid data also indicates that summer temperature is useful for tree growth. Greater numbers of samples are needed to provide better results in this regard...|$|R
