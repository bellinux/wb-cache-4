The cooking experiments were {{carried out in the}} laboratory with either a lab-prepared or a mill-prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid</b> and the temperature and time were varied. The influences of dissolved organic and inorganic components in the cooking liquor on the final pulp composition and on the extent of side reactions were investigated. Kinetic equations were developed and the activation energies for delignification and carbohydrate dissolution were calculated using the Arrhenius equation. A better understanding of the delignification mechanisms during bisulfite and <b>acid</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>cooking</b> was obtained by analyzing the lignin carbohydrate complexes (LCC) present in the pulp when different cooking conditions were used. It was found that using a mill-prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid</b> beneficial effect with respect to side reactions, extractives removal and higher stability in pH during the cook were observed compared to a lab-prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid.</b> However, no significant difference in degrees of delignification or carbohydrate degradation was seen.  The cellulose yield was not affected in the initial phase of the cook however; temperature had an influence on the rates of both delignification and hemicellulose removal. It was also found that the  corresponding activation energies increased in the order:  xylan, glucomannan, lignin and cellulose. The cooking temperature could thus be used to control the cook to a given carbohydrate composition in the final pulp. Lignin condensation reactions were observed during <b>acid</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>cooking,</b> especially at higher temperatures. The LCC studies indicated the existence of covalent bonds between lignin and hemicellulose components with respect to xylan and glucomannan. LCC in native wood showed the presence of phenyl glycosides, ϒ-esters and α-ethers; whereas the α-ethers  were affected during sulfite pulping. The existence of covalent bonds between lignin and wood polysaccharides might be the rate-limiting factor in sulfite pulping. The sulfite pulping process is today practised in {{only a small number of}} pulp mills around the globe and the number of sulfite mills that use sodium as the base (cation) is less than five. However, due to the increasing interest in the wood based biorefinery concept, the benefits of sulfite pulping and especially the sodium based variety, has recently gained a lot of interest. It was therefore considered to be of high importance to further study the sodium based sulfite process to investigate if its benefits could be better utilized in the future in the production of dissolving pulps. Of specific interest was to investigate how the pulping conditions in the initial part of the cook (≥ 60 % pulp yield) should be performed in the best way. Thus, this thesis is focused on the initial phase of sodium based single stage bisulfite, acid sulfite and two-stage <b>sulfite</b> <b>cooking</b> of either 100 % spruce, 100 % pine or 100 % pine heartwood chips. The cooking experiments were carried out with either a lab prepared or a mill prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid</b> and the temperature and cooking time were varied.

The process includes a fermentation process {{for the production of}} biofuel. The calculation for three cases was done. The three cases considered were with a spruce sulfite pulp production of 100, 250 and 1000 Adt/day corresponding to 10, 25 and 100 % of the total pulp production. A kraft cooking process with prehydrolysis was taken in consideration as reference.

The energy consumption in the sulfite process is assumed to be slightly higher than in the kraft prehydrolysis process. The recovery system for spent liquor mix was studied.

Thus, this thesis is focused on the initial phase of single stage sodium bisulfite cooking of either 100 % spruce or 100 % pine wood chips. The cooking experiments were carried out with either a lab prepared or a mill prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid</b> and the temperature and cooking time were varied. Activation energies for different wood components were investigated as well as side reactions concerning the formation of thiosulfate and sulfate. Single stage sodium bisulfite cooking was carried out on either spruce or pine wood chips to investigate the influence of several process parameters in the initial phase of such a cook i. e. between 100 % and 60 % pulp yield. The cooking experiments were carried out with either a lab prepared or a mill prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid</b> and the temperature and time in the initial stage were varied. The influence of dissolved organics and inorganics components in the cooking liquor on the final pulp properties and side reactions were investigated. The impact of temperature and time on the pulp components were analyzed with respect to carbohydrates, lignin, extractives and thiosulfate. Kinetic equations were developed and the activation energies for delignification and carbohydrate dissolution were calculated using the Arrhenius equation. It was found that if using a mill prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid,</b> this had a beneficial effect with respect to side reactions, better extractives removal and higher pH stability during the cook, compared to a corresponding cook with a lab prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Cooking</b> with mill prepared and lab prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acids</b> showed the same behaviour with respect to delignification and carbohydrate degradation, but the lab acid experiments resulted in a higher thiosulfate formation during the cook. The cellulose yield was not affected at all during the initial phase of the sulfite cook verifying earlier results by other researchers. The temperature had an influence on both the delignification rate and the rate of hemicelluloses removal.  The corresponding activation energies were found to increase in the following order; cellulose, xylan, glucomannan and lignin.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} SO 2 -ethanol-water (SEW) {{fractionation}} {{as a potential}} method for a Lignocellulosic Biorefinery to achieve high yield separation of the three important components of biomass; cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. Representatives of all principal biomass species were successfully treated by SEW fractionation at similar rates. The kinetics of delignification, polysaccharides removal and cellulose hydrolysis at different temperatures and SO 2 concentrations are described and interpreted {{from the viewpoint of}} acid-catalysed degradation of the biomass polymers. The fractionation pattern is compared to that of commercial <b>acid</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>cooking.</b> The kinetics of delignification, hemicelluloses removal and cellulose hydrolysis during SEW fractionation each follow a two phase behaviour. The delignification is first order in lignin and SO 2. The observed lignin sulfonation and delignification patterns can be explained using Hägglund's consecutive fast sulfonation-slow hydrolysis scheme. During the initial phase of fractionation, the hemicelluloses removal and cellulose hydrolysis rates are related to the delignification rate, while in the following bulk phase the former two processes proceed independently from the latter. It is proposed that during the initial phase the hemicelluloses are removed together with lignin in the form of lignocarbohydrate complexes, while cellulose is protected by lignin from hydrolytic attack leading to a lower hydrolysis rate. Most hemicellulose side units as well as acetyl groups are cleaved during the first phase, while the glucomannan and xylan backbone polymers are removed at a considerably lower rate in the second (bulk) phase following first order kinetics in the residual polysaccharides. The observed polysaccharides dissolution behaviour can be interpreted in terms of low glucomannan stabilisation by crystallisation on cellulose at the applied conditions. Minimal cellulose dissolution occurs during fractionation, but the cellulose degree of polymerisation decreases by hydrolysis following zero-order kinetics. The products include cellulosic fibres and a spent liquor containing lignin and hydrolysed hemicellulose sugars, the latter present up to 50 % in monomeric form. The investigated overall and carbohydrate material balances show no carbohydrate losses as further supported by very low amounts of formed oxidation and dehydration products. The properties of the fibre products are evaluated and their potential applications are discussed. The amount of sulfur bound to lignin is 2 - 3 times lower than that in <b>acid</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>cooking,</b> and accounts for less than 1. 1 % on wood.

40|$|Santos, J. Ignacio et al. Lignosulfonates, {{isolated}} from the black liquors of <b>sulfite</b> <b>cooking</b> to obtain cellulose pulp (Sjöström 1993), are the only available commercial lignins nowadays, with different industrial and agricultural applications. This is because the lignin released during the kraft cooking of wood, largely the process most widely used for paper pulp manufacture, is burnt for recovery of chemicals and energy supply to the mill. The commercial utilization of lignosulfonates largely depends on tailoring their physico-chemical properties for the different applications intended, including molecular weight distribution and presence of functional groups (Lebo et al. 2008). Different chemical treatments, including oxidative modifications, {{can be used to}} change these lignosulfonate properties, but the economic costs of some of them limit their industrial applicability, especially when low-value products are to be produced. Oxidative enzymes, including laccases (benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1. 10. 3. 2) in the presence of redox mediators, have been largely investigated for the removal of lignin-derived compounds in paper pulp manufacture (Call et al. 1997) and more recently also for pitch control (Gutiérrez et al. 2009) and multipurpose functionalization of pulp fibers and other wood products (Widsten et al. 2008). Very recently the potential of the above enzymatic system to modify lignosulfonates is being investigated as a potential alternative to the chemical treatments, which often require harsh application conditions (Prasetyo et al. 2010). Despite <b>sulfite</b> <b>cooking</b> historically preceded kraft cooking, the chemical structure of lignosulfonates is not known into detail. This is because some of the most powerful tools for the chemical characterization of complex macromolecules, such as multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that enabled the discovery of new substructures in wood lignin (Zhang et al. 2006), are only recently being applied to lignosulfonates (Lutnaes et al. 2008). In the present study we used two different NMR techniques - namely solution 1 H- 13 C correlation 2 D-NMR in HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum correlation) experiments and solid-state CPMAS (cross-polarization and magic angle spinning) 13 C NMR - to investigate {{the nature and extent of}} the chemical changes produced by the laccase-mediator system when applied on a softwood lignosulfonate. The work was supported by the BIORENEW project (NMP 2 -CT- 2006 - 026456, www. biorenew. org). Guro E. Fredheim (Borregaard, Norway) is acknowledged for the lignosulfonate sample. Peer reviewe...|$|R

A modification of two of the methods was suggested and evaluated. A common practice used to minimise the hexenuronic acid content involves use of a high cooking temperature. The kinetic study showed that the degree of substitution of pulp xylan is only slightly affected by temperature, and that the observed effects {{are likely to be more}} associated with the xylan content of the pulp than with the hexenuronic acid content of the xylan. For the dissolved xylan, however, the degree of substitution showed a high temperature dependency and moreover it was always higher than in the pulp. Xylan itself is known to have the capacity to increase the strength of the manufactured pulp. This knowledge was applied by exchanging cooking liquors between birch kraft cooks, in which a high amount of xylan is dissolved, and spruce cooks, which contain very small amounts of native xylan. This seems like an attractive alternative for softwood kraft cooking, since both the tensile strength and stiffness increased significantly. The magnitude of the strength increase was correlated with the molecular weight of the added xylan and with the increased surface charge of the fibres. QC 2010111...|$|R

The different methods showed varied deviation of nutrients and antinutrients from the raw seeds. Sprouting and cooking significantly increased protein content and decreased starch and soluble carbohydrates levels. K, Na {{and all the}} trace elements studied were decreased by processing methods. Cooking was more effective in improving bioavailability of minerals studied than soaking or sprouting. Total polyphenols reduced more by <b>cooking,</b> while phytic <b>acid</b> did not change significantly by processing. In vitro protein digestibility was significantly reduced by all processing methods, with soaking gave {{the highest percentage of}} reduction and cooking the lowest percentage. The results also indicated that domestic processing methods changed total acidity and fat acidity as well as N solubility in water and 1 M NaCl. Amino acid profile of the karkade seed indicated that sulfur amino acids and threonine are the limiting amino acids. With respect to FAO pattern, considerable proportion of the essential amino acids were retained on processing, except for lysine on soaking and sprouting and sulfur acids on sprouting and cooking.

40|$|With overall higher use of {{wood and}} wooden {{materials}} in the future, the importance of recycled wood will increase. Recycled wood is currently used {{for the production of}} wood based composites and for combustion. In the future, use of recycled wood will also be important as feedstock for biorefineries for the production of bio-based chemicals and biofuels. The present paper gives preliminary results on the feasibility of A I recycled wood (German classification, natural wood only treated mechanically) in a steam explosion and organosolv pre-treatment process. The presence of inorganic pollutants and non-wooden material in recycled wood material was investigated. The effect of recycled wood heterogeneity (e. g., variable wood species and wide particle size distribution) on performance of wood pretreatment and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis was also evaluated. Microeconomic analysis of lignocellulosic feedstock for a biorefinery using organosolv cooking was calculated with various price scenarios and various proportions of recycled wood instead of fresh beech chips. The results show that the concentration of inorganic pollutants is higher than in fresh wood but below the limit values for polluted wood. Preliminary results on steam explosion and ethanol based organosolv <b>cooking</b> without an <b>acid</b> catalyst showed typical behaviour of softwood for recycled wood of A I quality in respect of hydrolysability, thus being a potential future raw material for sugar production. A I recycled wood {{can be used in a}} biorefinery without major problems and can significantly improve the economics of investment in an industrial scale biorefinery...|$|R

All groups were fed on concentrate feed mixture plus 1 % of live body weight wheat straw for 169 days. Four levels (zero, 200 g, 400 g and 600 g) of leucaena hay were used. Final weight and carcass traits were evaluated. Color (L, a, b), proximate composition, pH, acidity, expressible water, water holding capacity, <b>cooking</b> loss, amino <b>acid</b> and minerals contents of meat were determined. Sensory evaluation of cooked meat was also evaluated. The results revealed that, Hindquarter, shoulder, and sets weight were significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) different. Moisture, protein, fat and ash content of fresh meat were ranged from 73. 72 to 76. 23 %, 20. 06 to 20. 80 %, 2. 41 to 4. 12 % and 1. 01 to 1. 08 %, respectively. Expressible water, water holding capacity and pH were significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) different. No significant (p ≤ 0. 05) {{differences were found in}} color (L, a, b), acidity and cooking loss of meat. Amino acids and minerals contents of all meat samples were varied. Cooked meat of group four had the highest scores of tenderness, juiciness, flavor and over all acceptability 4. 6, 4. 5, 4. 4 and 4. 5, respectively. This study suggested that the leucaena hay is suitable for lamb feeding. Produced lamb meat had high chemical and sensory quality...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Results of {{many studies}} {{indicate}} that consumption of n- 3 fatty acids can benefit persons with cardiovascular disease and rheumatoid arthritis. However, encapsulated fish oil {{is unlikely to be}} suited to lifetime daily use and recommendations to increase fish intake have not been effective. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the effectiveness of a diet that incorporates foods rich in n- 3 fatty acids in elevating tissue concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid and in suppressing the production of inflammatory mediators. DESIGN: Healthy male volunteers were provided with foods that were enriched in alpha-linolenic <b>acid</b> (<b>cooking</b> oil, margarine, salad dressing, and mayonnaise) and eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (sausages and savory dip) and with foods naturally rich in n- 3 fatty acids, such as flaxseed meal and fish. Subjects incorporated these products into their food at home for 4 wk. Fatty acid intakes, cellular and plasma fatty acid concentrations, and monocyte-derived eicosanoid and cytokine production were measured. RESULTS: Analyses of dietary records indicated that intake of eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid averaged 1. 8 g/d and intake of alpha-linolenic acid averaged 9. 0 g/d. These intakes led to an average 3 -fold increase in eicosapentaenoic acid in plasma, platelet, and mononuclear cell phospholipids. Thromboxane B(2), prostaglandin E(2), and interleukin 1 beta synthesis decreased by 36 %, 26 %, and 20 % (P < 0. 05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Foods that are strategically or naturally enriched in n- 3 fatty acids can be used to achieve desired biochemical effects without the ingestion of supplements or a change in dietary habits. A wide range of n- 3 -enriched foods could be developed to support large-scale programs {{on the basis of the}} therapeutic and disease-preventive effects of n- 3 fatty acids.

Significant differences {{in the quality of}} vegetables cooked by various methods were found. Stir-fried spinach retained significantly more ascorbic acid than spinach prepared by the other cooking methods. Stir-fried green beans also retained significantly more ascorbic acid than green beans prepared by the other methods, {{with the exception of the}} steaming method. The stir-fried broccoli retained a high percentage of ascorbic acid though the retention was not significantly greater than that in broccoli cooked by the other methods. Stir-fried spinach, green beans and broccoli retained significantly more chlorophyll than samples prepared by the other cooking methods, except that the stir-fried broccoli did not differ significantly from the broccoli boiled in large amounts of water. A high correlation was found between chlorophyll retention and color scores obtained through sensory tests in all three vegetables. With the exception of color stir-frying was a less acceptable cooking method than the other cooking methods as judged by the taste panel. Considering total palatability scores, the microwave method was ranked most acceptable for spinach and green beans while boiling in large amounts of water was ranked most acceptable for broccoli samples. Stir-frying was found to be an excellent method of <b>cooking</b> for ascorbic <b>acid</b> and chlorophyll retention in the three vegetables studied.

40|$|Rice {{fortification}} {{with multiple}} micronutrients (folic acid, iron and &# 946;-carotene) by utilizing two different processes: parboiling- an ancient process and High Pressure processing (HPP)  a novel {{process has been}} examined in this thesis. The fortification process was addressed through four vital phases: optimisation of parboiling process and use of HPP for fortification with multiple micronutrients, physico-chemical properties of the fortified rice, consumer acceptance study and bio-accessibility and transport studies. Parboiling process was optimised for fortifying rice with three micronutrients using the following condition: soaking the brown rice at 70 °C for 2 hours with the fortificant solution(FA- 150 mg; BC- 62. 5 mg; Fe- 25 mg) followed by steaming at 100 °C for 1 hour and then air drying the rice at room temperature until the moisture content dropped to 10 - 12 %. Folic acid showed highest uptake during parboiling. After <b>cooking</b> folic <b>acid</b> was retained the highest (98 %) followed by iron (90 %) and then &# 946;-carotene (35 %). For HPP, thebest condition for fortification was selected: treating milled white rice with the fortificant solution at 200 MPa for 1 hour (non-thermal) and then air-drying the processed rice (10 - 12 % final moisture content). Folic acid showed highest uptake after HPP (41 %) followed by &# 946;-carotene and iron (20 % each). Retention in cooked HPP rice followed the same trend as parboiled rice- Folic acid (98 %) > Iron (64 %) >&# 946;-carotene (18 %). Rice fortified by the twotechniques was assessed for physico-chemical properties to understand changes in starch during fortification. The process of adding nutrients {{did not have an}} impact on starch properties in the fortified rice. Parboiled rice was completely gelatinised while HPP rice showed partial gelatinization which affected hydrolysis of starch by &# 945;-amylase which in turn influenced the release of vitamins from the rice matrix during extraction and in vitro digestion. Fortified parboiled rice was diluted with white rice and assessed for colour variation instrumentally in comparison to white rice, which showed no significant difference betweenthem. The diluted fortified rice was presented to consumers for visual and taste acceptance. Fortified diluted rice (uncooked) was not as acceptable as uncooked white rice (coomercial) to consumers due to non-uniformity in appearance. Initially the purchase intent was low (28 %) for the diluted fortified rice. Howeverafter informing consumers about fortification and the additional nutritional value, purchase intent for fortified rice increased to 51 % implying that {{at least half of the}} consumers were willing to buy the rice. 76 % of consumers preferred cooked fortified rice mixed with white rice particularly when mentioned about fortification. The bio-accessibility of fortified micronutrients using both techniques viii were higher for fortified parboiled rice (FA- 96 % BC- 12 %) followed by HPP (FA- 46 %; BC- 2 %) compared to the fortificant solution (FA- 80 %; BC- 0. 1 %) containing the same concentration of nutrients except for iron (parboiled rice- 31 %, HPP rice  42 % and fortificant- 38 %). Fortification with multiple micronutrients using parboiling process showed better transport (FA- 33 %; BC- 23 % and Ferritin 26 ng/mL) after in vitro digestionand would be easier for implementation...|$|R
