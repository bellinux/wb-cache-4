40|$|International audienceMantle-derived {{volcanic}} {{rocks on}} Mars display {{physical and chemical}} commonalities with mafic-ultramafic ferropicrite and komatiite volcanism on the Earth. Terrestrial komatiites are common hosts of massive sulfide mineralization enriched in siderophile-chalcophile precious metals (i. e., Ni, Cu, and the platinum-group elements). These deposits correspond to the batch segregation and accumulation of immiscible sulfide liquids {{as a consequence of}} mechanical/thermo-mechanical erosion and assimilation of sulfur-rich bedrock during the turbulent flow of high-temperature and low-viscosity komatiite lava flows. This study adopts this mineralization model and presents numerical simulations of erosion and assimilation of sulfide- and sulfate-rich <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrates</b> during the dynamic emplacement of (channelled) mafic-ultramafic lava flows on Mars. For <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrates</b> containing adequate sulfide proportions (e. g., 1 wt% S), our simulations suggest that sulfide supersaturation in low-temperature (1400 °C). The precious-metals tenor in the derived immiscible sulfide liquids may be significantly upgraded {{as a result of their}} prolonged equilibration with large volumes of silicate melts along flow conduits. The influence of sulfate assimilation on sulfide supersaturation in martian lava flows is addressed by simulations of melt-gas equilibration in the C-H-O-S fluid system. However, prolonged sulfide segregation and deposit genesis by means of sulfate assimilation appears to be limited by lava oxidation and the release of sulfur-rich gas. The identification of massive sulfide endowments on Mars is not possible from remote sensing data. Yet the results of this study aid to define regions for the potential occurrence of such mineral systems, which may be the large canyon systems Noctis Labyrinthus and Valles Marineris, or the Hesperian channel systems of Mars’ highlands (e. g., Kasei Valles), most of which have been periodically draped by mafic-ultramafic lavas...|$|E

Results were suggestive but inconclusive that sulfide production via sulfate reduction and putrefaction adhere to the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model.

The Mn/Fe ratios < 1. 5 indicate the hydrogenetic accretion of the Fe–Mn hydroxides. These Fe–Mn crusts are enriched in Co (up to 0. 9 %, average ∼ 0. 5 %) and Ce. The Ce-content is the highest reported so far (up to 3763 ppm, average ∼ 2250 ppm) for global ocean seamount Fe–Mn crusts. In spite of general similarity {{in the range of}} major, minor, and strictly trivalent rare earth element composition, the dissimilarity between the present Fe–Mn crusts and the Pacific seamount Fe–Mn crusts in Co and Ce associations with major mineral phases indicates inter-oceanic heterogeneity and region-specific conditions responsible for their enrichment. The decrease in Ce-anomaly (from ∼ 8 to ∼ 1. 5) with increasing water depth (from ∼ 1. 7 km to ∼ 3. 2 km) might suggest that the modern intermediate depth low oxygen layer was shifted and sustained at a deeper depth for a long period in the past. 1...|$|E
40|$|A machine {{learning}} system (MART) {{was used to}} predict soil parent material at regional scale. We tested the use of punctual soil observations as training data, instead of soil maps used in previous studies, which enables a more even distribution of the training data over the study area (Brittany, NW France). This region shows mainly metamorphic, igneous and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrates.</b> However, superficial deposits (Aeolian loam, colluvium and alluvial material), represent very often the actual soil parent material and are very poorly delimitated by existing geological maps. To calibrate a predictive model, MART requires (i) training data, which correspond to the variable to predict, and (ii) environmental predictors. Model predictions were compared (i) to punctual data not used to calibrate the model (crossvalidation), (ii) to the whole punctual dataset, and (iii) to existing soil maps (external validation). The three kinds of validation showed an accuracy of parent material prediction of 56 %, 80 % and 54 %, respectively. Aeolian loam was among the three best predicted substrates.

40|$|Geophysical {{data from}} the Antarctic Peninsula {{continental}} shelf reveal streamlined subglacial bedforms in a cross-shelf trough. Bedforms exhibit progressive elongation with distance along the trough, and record flow of a paleo-ice stream from the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet during the last glacial maximum. Downflow evolution of the bedforms indicates increasing flow velocities as the ice stream traversed the shelf. This, in turn, is related to a transition from crystalline bedrock on the inner shelf to a soft <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrate</b> on the outer shelf. Although streaming flow operated across both substrates, the highest flow velocities occurred over the soft bed. Spatial variation in the inferred nature of fast-flow, from sliding to subglacial sediment deformation and/or ploughing, was also lithologically controlled.

Analysis of geomorphic features and sediments on the continental shelf reveal the mechanism and timing of ice-sheet advance and retreat during the last glacial cycle. The ice sheet was grounded on the outer shelf during maximum extent.

Thinner, but more rapidly flowing ice characterized the seaward extent of the ice sheet, which was grounded on a <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrate.</b> Deglaciation is described by two phases. The outer-most extension of ice retreated gradually, stopping on a bathymetric high on the middle shelf by ∼ 16, 000 years ago.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several motile, {{filamentous}} cyanobacteria {{display the}} ability to self-assemble into tightly woven or twisted groups of filaments that form macroscopic yarns or ropes, and that are often centimeters long and 50 - 200 microm in diameter. Traditionally, this trait has been the basis for taxonomic definition of several genera, notably Microcoleus and Hydrocoleum, but the trait has not been associated with any plausible function. METHOD AND FINDINGS: Through the use of phylogenetic reconstruction, we demonstrate that pedigreed, rope-building cyanobacteria from various habitats do not form a monophyletic group. This {{is consistent with the}} hypothesis that rope-building ability was fixed independently in several discrete clades, likely through processes of convergent evolution or lateral transfer. Because rope-building cyanobacteria share {{the ability to}} colonize geologically unstable <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrates,</b> such as subtidal and intertidal marine sediments and non-vegetated soils, it is also likely that this supracellular differentiation capacity imparts a particular fitness advantage in such habitats. The physics of sediment and soil erosion in fact predict that threads in the 50 - 200 microm size range will attain optimal characteristics to stabilize such substrates on contact. CONCLUSIONS: Rope building is a supracellular morphological adaptation in filamentous cyanobacteria that allows them to colonize physically unstable sedimentary environments, and to act as successful pioneers in the biostabilization process...|$|E

The differentiation between populations identified as E. risdonii andSouthern E. tenuiramis {{is much smaller}} than the separation between the extreme forms of E. tenuiramis (Northernand Peninsula E. tenuiramis). The differentiation in the E. tenuiramis complex is associated with geography andsubstrate type, with the Southern morph restricted to <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrates</b> and the other morphs to igneoussubstrates.

A total of 183 phytosociological relevés were performed in the period 2009 - 2012. Despite strong human influence, the area studied {{is characterized by the}} occurrence of several plant-communities, mainly represented by woods and shrubs vegetation (Quercion ilicis, Oleo sylvestris-Ceratonion siliquae), riparian woods and shrubs (Platanion orientalis, Rhamno-Prunetea), dry grasslands (Lygeo-Stipetea), hygrophilous communities (Molinio-Arrhenatheretea, Nasturtio-Glycerietalia and Isoeto-Nanojuncetea), rupicolous communities (Asplenietea trichomanis, Parietarietea judaicae), rocky coast communities (Crithmo-Limonietea), pasture coenosis (Poetea bulbosae), spring-flowering meadows (Tuberarietea guttatae and Stipo-Trachynietea distachyae) and nitrophilous communities (Onopordetea acanthii). The vegetation analysis allowed the identification of 34 vegetation types, with 8 new associations and 3 new sub-associations, and also allowed the reconstruction of the vegetation series and landscape units (geosynphytosociology). The synphytosociological analysis of the plant communities allowed the identification of the main vegetation series: climatophilous acidophilous series of metamorphic substrates (Erico arboreae-Querco virgilianae sigmetum); climatophilous basophilous series of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrates</b> (Oleo-Querco virgilianae sigmetum); edaphomesophilous series of the cliffs (Bupleuro fruticosi-Querco ilicis sigmetum); edapho-xerophilous series of the semirupestrian maquis (Euphorbieto dendroidis sigmetum); edafo-hygrophylous geoseries of the riparian wood (Platano-Salico gussonei sigmetum); and chasmophilous permaseries of the cliffs (Erucastro virgati sigmetum, Limonio ionici sigmetum).

In this review, we discuss the physics of aeolian sediment transport from a physical point of view.

We then introduce the concepts [...] e. g. saturated flux, saturation length [...] and the relevant framework {{for the development of a}} continuum quantitative description of transport. Static and dynamical entrainment thresholds are modeled and discussed. Steady transport is investigated in two asymptotic regimes: close to threshold and far above it. In both cases, a simple picture, taking into account the negative feedback of particles on the wind flow, is analytically drawn and compared to experimental and numerical data. The low wind velocity regime corresponds to the model proposed by Ungar and Haff (1987) and the high wind velocity regime is elaborated from initial ideas of Bagnold (1941). Transport transient is also studied in detail, and scaling laws for the saturation length are proposed. Finally, some open issues for future research are outlined in the conclusion...|$|R

The goal {{of this study was}} to identify differences in the structures of the herbaceous communities growing on a crystalline substrate and those growing on a <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrate</b> in a semiarid region of northeastern Brazil. One hundred 1 × 1 m plots were established in each area for quantitative sampling, with 69 species recorded in the crystalline area and 76 in the sedimentary area. The average plant density was higher in the sedimentary area, and average diameters and heights were greater in the crystalline area. The families and species with a high Importance Value Index (IVI) and a high Mixed Ecological Value Index (MEVI) differed between the areas. Of the species with high densities, only four were found in both areas. Shannon-Weiner diversity index values in the crystalline (2. 96 nats/ind. - 1) and sedimentary (2. 89 nats/ind. - 1) areas were similar. Evenness values on both substrates were also similar (0. 72 and 0. 71 in the crystalline and sedimentary areas, respectively). This study shows that variations in plant establishment conditions between crystalline and sedimentary areas in a semiarid region of northeastern Brazil should be considered as structure-modeling factors for the herbaceous community...|$|R
40|$|Many marine {{gastropods}} {{face the}} challenge of adhering to substrates under adverse flow conditions. Some species live on both solid and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrates,</b> although how these substrate generalists resist detachment from materials with fundamentally different mechanical properties is not well studied. We used field observations and flow tank experiments to compare the capabilities and tactics of Haminoea vesicula, an opisthobranch gastropod, when exposed to destabilizing flow on its native sand and eelgrass. Velocities of outgoing and incoming spring tides in the tidal creeks and over and within eelgrass beds where H. vesicula live at False Bay, San Juan Island, WA ranged from 1 to 30 cm/s. In a flow tank, snails’ resistance to current depended on substrate and orientation. On eelgrass, snails moving into flow maintained their position at velocities exceeding 40 cm/s, but were more vulnerable when facing away or sideways to flow (falling off at mean velocities of 25 and 32 cm/s respectively). In the latter orientation, snails would often rotate into flow by hooking onto the leading edge of eelgrass with the anterior edge of the cephalic shield. In this position, snails resisted flows exceeding 40 cm/s. Snails crawling on sediment and exposed to turbulent flow drew sediment-encrusted mucus sheets dorsally, completely ensheathing their bodies. “Sheeting” significantly increased snails’ effective weight and ability to resist flow. On sand, snails ensheathed in sediment were least stable in the sideways orientation compared to those facing into or away from flow (mean velocities of 13 vs. 20 and 23 cm/s). Experiments on sandpaper indicated that snails were destabilized on sediment due to failure of adhesion of the sedimentary layers beneath them rather than their attachment to the sand...|$|E
40|$|Continual {{input of}} {{reactive}} nitrogen (N) {{is required to}} support the natural turnover of N in terrestrial ecosystems. This “N demand” can be satisfied in various ways, including biological N fixation (BNF) (the dominant pathway under natural conditions), lightning-induced abiotic N fixation, N uptake from <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrates,</b> and N deposition from natural and anthropogenic sources. We estimated the global new N fixation demand (NNF), i. e. the total new N input required to sustain net primary production (NPP) in nonagricultural terrestrial ecosystems regardless of its origin, using a N-enabled global dynamic vegetation model (DyNLPJ). DyN-LPJ does not explicitly simulate BNF; rather, it estimates total NNF using a mass balance criterion and assumes that this demand is met from one source or another. The model was run in steady state and then in transient mode driven by recent changes in CO 2 concentration and climate. A range of values for key stoichiometric parameters was considered, based on recently published analyses. Modelled NPP and C : N ratios of litter and soil organic matter were consistent with independent estimates. Modelled geographic patterns of ecosystem NNF were similar to other analyses, but actual estimated values exceeded recent estimates of global BNF. The results were sensitive to a few key parameters: the fraction of litter carbon respired to CO 2 during decomposition and plant-type-specific C : N ratios of litter and soil. The modelled annual NNF increased by about 15 % {{during the course of}} the transient run, mainly due to increasing CO 2 concentration. The model did not overestimate recent terrestrial carbon uptake, suggesting that the increase in NNF demand has so far been met. Rising CO 2 is further increasing the NNF demand, while the future capacity of N sources to support this is unknown...|$|E
40|$|A grid {{derived from}} a new {{compilation}} of marine echo-sounding data sets has allowed us to visualize and map the geomorphology of the entire continental shelf around South Georgia at an unprecedented level of detail. The grid is the first continuous bathymetric data set covering South Georgia to include multibeam swath bathymetry and represent them at a subkilometer resolution. Large and previously undescribed glacially eroded troughs, linked to South Georgia's modern-day fjords, radiate from the island, marking the former pathways of large outlet glaciers and ice streams. A tectonic or geological influence is apparent for the major troughs, where glaciers have exploited structural weaknesses on the continental block. Bed forms lining the troughs give some first insights into glacial dynamics within the troughs, suggesting arteries of fast flowing ice occupied these topographic depressions {{in the past and}} operated over both bedrock and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrates.</b> On the outer shelf and within the troughs, large ridges and banks are also common, interpreted as terminal, lateral, and recessional moraines marking former positions of ice sheets on the shelf and their subsequent reorganization during deglaciation. A small trough mouth fan has developed at the mouth of {{at least one of the}} cross-shelf troughs, demonstrating a focused sediment delivery to the margin. Slides and slide scars are also present on parts of the margin, showing that margin stability, perhaps also related to glaciation, has been an important factor in depositional processes on the continental slope. Implications of the new observations are that ice sheets have been more extensive on South Georgia than any previous studies have reported. Their age may date back to late Miocene times, and evolution of the shelf system has probably involved numerous late Cenozoic glacial episodes. However, relatively fresh seafloor geomorphology coupled with evidence from other maritime-Antarctic islands (Heard Island and Kerguelen Island) indicating extensive glaciation at the Last Glacial Maximum raises the possibility that the extent of sub-Antarctic glaciation for the Last Glacial period has, until now, been underestimated...|$|E

Biogeochemical processes within a CRT were hypothesized to support and improve several estuarine functions such as sediment trapping and nutrient burial. In 2006, the first pilot CRT was implemented in the freshwater zone of the estuary. Fifteen sediment physicochemical descriptors were intensively monitored over 3 years in the newly created CRT and in reference habitats from the adjacent estuary. Soil transformed rapidly in the CRT; in the most frequently flooded zones, {{the formation of a}} nutrient-rich estuarine <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrate</b> contrasted with the estuarine sand flats where shear stress is sustained by coastal squeeze.

However, despite such variations, successful CRT nutrient trapping and fine particles burial were demonstrated.

These features include mounds, conical forms with rimmed summit depressions, flatter irregularly-shaped forms with raised rims, and polygonal terrain. Based on morphology, size, and analogy to terrestrial ground ice forms, these Athabascan features are interpreted as pingos, collapsing pingos, pingo scars, and thermal contraction polygons, respectively. Thermal Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (THEMIS) data and geological features {{in the area are}} consistent with a <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrate</b> underlying these features. These observations lead us to favor a ground ice interpretation, although we do not rule out volcanic and especially glaciofluvial hypotheses. The hypothesized ground ice that formed the mounds and rimmed features may have been emplaced via the deposition of saturated sediment during flooding; an alternative scenario invokes magmatically cycled groundwater. The ground ice implicit in the hypothesized thermal contraction polygons may have derived either from this flooding/ground water, or from atmospheric water vapor. The lack of obvious flood modification of the mounds and rimmed features indicates that they formed after the most recent flood inundated the area. Analogy with terrestrial pingos suggests that ground ice may be still extant within the positive relief mounds. As the water that flooded down Athabasca Valles emerged vi...|$|R

Background and Aims The geographical distributions of species are constrained by their ecological requirements. The {{aim of this}} work was to analyse the effects of environmental conditions, historical events and biogeographical constraints on the diversification of the three species of the western Mediterranean shrub genus Stauracanthus, which have a parapatric distribution in the Iberian Peninsula. Methods Ecological niche factor analysis and generalized linear models were {{used to measure the}} response of all Stauracanthus species to the environmental gradients and map their potential distributions in the Iberian Peninsula. The bioclimatic niche overlap between the three species was determined by using Schoener’s index. The genetic differentiation of the Iberian and northern African populations of Stauracanthus species was characterized with GenalEx. The effects on genetic distances of the most important environmental drivers were assessed through Mantel tests and non-metric multidimensional scaling. Results The three Stauracanthus species show remarkably similar responses to climatic conditions. This supports the idea that all members of this recently diversified clade retain common adaptations to climate and consequently high levels of climatic niche overlap. This contrasts with the diverse edaphic requirements of Stauracanthus species. The populations of the S. genistoides–spectabilis clade grow on Miocene and Pliocene finetextured sedimentary soils, whereas S. boivinii, the more genetically distant species, occurs on older and more coarse-textured <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrates.</b> These patterns of diversification are largely consistent with a stochastic process of geographical range expansion and fragmentation coupled with niche evolution in the context of spatially complex environmental fluctuationsConclusions: The combined analysis of the distribution, realized environmental niche and phylogeographical relationships of parapatric species proposed in this work allows integration of the biogeographical, ecological and evolutionary processes driving the evolution of species adaptations and how they determine their current geographical ranges.

40|$|The Pennell Coast {{continental}} shelf is isolated from West Antarctic Ice Sheet drainage; for an ice sheet to ground {{in this region}} it must flow over the Transantarctic Mountains from East Antarctica. Features observed indicate that ice grounded on the Pennell shelf. Cores from the shelf sampled till, a pelletized unit, glacial-marine sediments, contourite deposits, and diatomaceous muds. The timing of ice sheet grounding is revealed by radiocarbon dates that indicate the ice sheet was grounded on the shelf during the Last Glacial Maximum and has a retreat history that differs from nearby drainage areas. Comparison to sea-level curves suggests that melting ice from the region contributed to the Holocene sea-level rise and that formation of that ice contributed to the fall in sea level immediately prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. Comparison between the Pennell Coast and drainage outlets of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet allows examination of controls on ice sheet behavior. There is a consistent pattern of erosional features on the crystalline bedrock of the inner shelf, mega-scale glacial lineations on the sedimentary strata of the outer shelf, and drumlins between the two. The troughs {{in the areas of}} sedimentary substrate are interpreted to have been occupied by fast-flowing ice and those in the areas of crystalline substrate by slower-moving ice. The Pennell shelf differs in that it has both crystalline and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrates</b> but no drumlins or lineations. Possible reasons for this difference include the size of the drainage basin, the narrow {{continental shelf}}, and the high sand content of the tills. Core and seismic data were used to conduct an analysis of the west Louisiana outer shelf depositional systems formed during the last glacial-eustatic cycle. Differences in deltaic deposition in the area illustrate the complex relationship between depositional patterns and sea-level change. Particularly salient is {{the difference between the two}} primary sequence boundaries. The oldest sequence boundary is a major erosional surface. The youngest sequence boundary is characterized by much smaller channels and is primarily an interfluve feature.

40|$|Gully {{morphology}} (often {{summarized as}} comprising an alcove, channel and debris apron) {{is one of}} the key elements used to support the argument for liquid water in the recent past on Mars. Nevertheless, the processes that create different gully morphologies, on both Mars and Earth, are not fully understood. One of the puzzling morphologic attributes of Martian dune gullies is their apparent lack of an apron, or terminal deposit, which has caused debate about their formation process. Several physical processes such as runoff, debris flows, granular flows, and sliding blocks falling downslope could explain the formation of these gullies. In this work, we focus on the role of liquid in the substrate as well as in the flow and choose to experimentally test the plausibility of this hypothesis. We performed a series of analogue experiments to investigate the formation of gullies on sand dune-like substrates. We used controlled flows of water over an inclined sand-box to produce gully-like forms. Ice-rich <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrates</b> were used, including substrates that included a thin liquid water-saturated thawed layer (an ‘active layer’) above the ice-saturated zone to give an analogue for a ‘periglacial’ environment. We quantitatively demonstrate that debris flow processes in ‘periglacial’ experiments are conducive to the formation of narrow and long channels with small terminal deposits with perched channels. By re-analysis of Martian elevation data for dune-gullies on Mars, we have found good evidence that such terminal deposits could exist. Our experiments revealed that increased water content in the thawed layer above the frozen bed increases flow-length due to the subsequent reduction in infiltration capacity. Water is incorporated into the flow by erosion of the wet thawed layer (sand plus water) and by drainage of the thawed layer. Using a Mars environment simulation chamber, we found that atmospheric pressure conditions seem to have a limited influence on the morphology of the flows. Our experimental investigation allowed the reproduction of terrestrial debris flow and Martian gully morphologies, suggesting that a substrate that is resistant to infiltration could be present beneath the dune gullies on Mars. We suggest that, like in our laboratory experiments, the presence of ice at shallow depth is a possible explanation for the formation of these morphologies and that a wet thawed layer is a possible explanation for the long flow-length...|$|E

The emergence of rice cultivating communities, utilising canals for both hydraulic management and transport, re{{presents a}}n important stage in the social evolution of southeast Asia. The emergence of complex polities in the region, which may have depended on both international trade and intensified agriculture, led ultimately to the formation of the famous Khmer empires which dominated the region on several occasions through the 1 st and 2 nd millennia AD. French colonial scholars identified possibly ancient canals in the region that may have played roles in trade, agriculture, or both. This series of ancient canal features near Angkor Borei {{has been the subject of}} recent investigations in a collaboration between the Universities of Glasgow and Hawaii. Luminescence profiling measurements were used to identify the canal bed, by exploiting the contrast between a regional substrate of some 50 ka depositional age and more recent archaeological sediments. In this manner it has been possible to identify the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrate,</b> undisturbed canal sediments, and redeposited material. Ages have been estimated for substrate and canal infill sediments. The work represents the first convincing demonstration of luminescence dating of one of these important regional features, and indeed the first confirmation of the presumed antiquity of the canal system around Angkor Borei...|$|R
40|$|The {{restricted}} {{nature of}} naturally-occurring freshwater resources on atolls {{is one of}} the greatest impediments to human settlement on these small, dispersed and remote islands. Any anthropogenic or environmental pressures that deleteriously affect the quantity or quality of atoll water resources are therefore a matter of concern. This chapter focuses on such issues. It first presents an overview of the principal characteristics of atoll fresh groundwater aquifers, which exist in the form of thin lenses within the Holocene sands and gravels that comprise the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrate</b> of low-lying atoll islets. Factors that influence the vulnerability of these freshwater lenses are then considered. The chapter continues by summarising the findings of recent studies that investigated the effects of storm-wave washover across atoll islets on freshwater lens profiles, and the subsequent patterns of recovery over time. Both field and modelling approaches are used. Combined results suggest that following groundwater salinisation by seawater intrusion, at least a year is required for full aquifer recovery. Of particular interest, it is found that in spite of a strong saline plume forming at relatively shallow depths, a thin horizon of freshwater sometimes remains preserved deeper within the aquifer profile for several months after the initial disturbance. In the Pacific basin, shifting geographical patterns in severe tropical storm events related to climatic variability and change are a threat to the continuing viability of atoll fresh groundwater resources and the human populations dependent upon them...|$|R

40|$|Spatial and {{seasonal}} variability of physicochemical parameters (salinity, pH, redox potential and sulphide concentration) were investigated in the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrate</b> of the mangrove-fringed coast of French Guiana {{in order to}} identify causes of species zonation and reciprocal effects between sediment and vegetation. Changes in salinity are mainly controlled by seasonal conditions and by location with respect to fresh water influx. No clear differences between values obtained under A. germinans and R. mangle. In contrast, {{a significant difference between the}} two species is shown by the depth distribution of redox potentials which values are remarkably high under Avicennia stands, so highlighting the ability of Avicennia to oxidize the sediment thanks to its radial cable roots. This phenomenon takes place uniquely the organic content is low. Conversely, in the older stages of Avicennia mangrove forests, the oxygen released by roots is probably insufficient to produce the decay of the large quantity of available organic matter. The low Eh values associated with the high sulphide concentrations denote sulphate-reducing processes similar to those observed under R. mangle stands. Nevertheless, the vertical shifting of water table produced by climatic influences modifies these processes. These results demonstrate that the sulphur content depends on the decay processes, which in turn depend on both the vegetal species and the sedimentary organic content. Consequently, this study suggests that, in contrast with many regions, neither salinity nor sulphide concentration are responsible for a zonation between A. germinans and R. mangle in the mangroves of French Guiana...|$|R
40|$|Investigations of the geology and {{physical}} limnology {{of a field}} of sedimentary furrows in Lake Superior have provided information {{on the characteristics of}} these bedforms and their relationship to the wind-driven currents and associated turbulence structures in the bottom boundary layer. The results generally support the existing conceptual model for furrow formation. Furrows in the study area (2 km 2) at 100 -m depth are spaced 20 -l 00 m apart and exceed 800 m long, the troughs being- 0. 5 m deep and 3 - 5 m wide. Sediment cores collected by submersible are poorly sorted, cohesive, terrigenous silts with a mean grain size of 20 pm. Relative to sediments in the interfurrow area, those in the trough contain higher fractions of sand and coarse debris and accumulate at a rate 15 % slower. Strong bottom currents (speed> 6 cm s-l) usually flow within 20 ” of the furrow direction and are most frequent between late October and early February, when wind-forced currents reach the bottom; annual peak speeds approach 30 cm s-l. The relationship of the current and temperature records to the wind field is consistent with predictions of coastal jet theory. Profiling current meters deployed on either side of a furrow showed near-bottom, cross-stream flow con-verging over the furrow with divergence higher in the boundary layer when the current speed exceeded 6 cm s-l. A preliminary numerical model exhibits a cross-stream flow pattern consistent with the profiler observations.

40|$|The Pitts Head welded {{ignimbrite}} records a subaerial, large-volume eruption {{and associated}} pyroclastic current that flowed into the sea. The current 15 km from source was steadily sustained with high mass flux and high particle concentration towards its base, and it entered the sea without substantial mixing {{with water and}} thus without large-scale hydroexplosivity and without general cooling. It continued to aggrade ignimbrite for at least 3 - 4 km from the original shoreline, in water initially ≥ 50 m deep. Entirely subaquous, hot-state, progressive aggradation and welding of the ignimbrite occurred where the water could not be wholly displaced by the current, although eventually the deposit displaced the shore> 4 km seawards. Wet sea-floor sediments buried by the ignimbrite were heated and locally fluidized by steam, and several square kilometres of hot ignimbrite with variable thicknesses of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrate</b> up to 60 m detached and slid downslope, almost perpendicular to the original flow direction. Directions of sliding and the order of piling-up of slide sheets are shown by hot-state (rheomorphic) deformation fabrics and the geometric relations of detachment surfaces. Sliding and slumping processes developed compressional structures like slump folds, stacking of several individual slide sheets, and lateral ramps, resulting in laterally varying thicknesses of 0 - 127 m. Extensional disruption of the ignimbrite is marked by breaks in the sheet via which fluidized sediments were mobilized, locally to form rootless vents. Both the initial incursion of the pyroclastic current into {{the sea and the}} subsequent submarine sliding of the ignimbrite are likely to have caused tsunami.

40|$|The {{coastal region}} of Rio de Janeiro State (Brazil) is {{strongly}} influenced {{by the presence of}} brackish water in its <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrate.</b> This study aims to map localities where the intrusion of brackish water in groundwater is taking place and to provide a guiding tool using the Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data to search freshwater for social use. The study area is located in Mico Leão Dourado Park, at the northern part of Cabo Frio municipality, Rio de Janeiro State, at 1. 5 km from the coast, onshore to Campos Basin. In this region, the potable water is scarce; therefore, the exploration and use of groundwater constitute an important alternative to the local population. We obtained one line of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) record on 2 D profile through 20 meters depth using 100 Mhz antenna in quaternary sedimentary area of the central area of Mico Leão Dourado Park. The method provides variations in the subsoil dielectric discontinuity as a function of GPR electromagnetic wave emission. The brackish water intrusion limited the penetration of GPR waves; thus, at some places, because of the change in conductivity of environment, {{it was not possible to}} map larger sediment thickness due to those conditions. Results of this research allowed understanding why freshwater or brackish water is being found in neighboring wells of the study area. The arrangement of the sedimentary layers interleaved with clay lenses allows getting freshwater from holes; and, in places without clay lenses, the wells have brackish water. The layered sedimentary structure seems to delimit the clay lenses which avoid the intrusion of marine water and the salinization of groundwater. The GPR method proved to be a useful tool for the characterization of the sediment layers on the edges of sedimentary basins, such as in Mico Leão Dourado Park, in Cabo Frio Region. ...|$|R
40|$|The structure, age and facies {{distribution}} of the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>substrate</b> of the Colli Albani volcano has been investigated by analysing sedimentary xenoliths enclosed in pyroclastic and phreatomagmatic deposits from different eruptive centres of the volcano, for comparison with the stratigraphies of deep wells drilled {{in the area and}} the known surface geology of the areas surrounding the volcano. Thin-section analysis has been carried out on the same xenolith samples collected and discussed by Funiciello and Parotto (1978. Il substrato sedimentario nell’area dei Colli Albani: considerazioni geodinamiche e paleogeografiche sul margine tirrenico dell’Appennino Centrale. Geologica Romana, 17, 233 – 287.) and Amato and Valensise (1986. Il basamento sedimentario dei Colli Albani: risultato di uno studio degli ejecta dei crateri idromagmatici di Albano e Nemi. Memorie Societa` Geologica Italiana, 35, 761 – 767.), largely from the maars deposits of the most recent Via dei Laghi period of activity of the volcano. The pre-orogen marine stratigraphic sequences range from Late Triassic?–Lower Lias to Middle Miocene, with carbonate platformto- basin facies. These sequences are very similar to those cropping out in the Sabina area to the north and NE of the volcano. Upper Cretaceous carbonate platform units, similar to those cropping out in the Lepini Mts, to the east of the volcano, have been recognized only in the xenoliths from the Nemi maar. Similar to that observed in the outcropping geology of the Sabina region, no evidence of siliciclastic xenoliths related to the Upper Miocene foredeep units have been found. The Upper Miocene?–Lower Pliocene to Upper Pliocene post-orogen marine sedimentary cycle has been recognized in almost all the eruptive centres, and has similarities with the sedimentary units present in the Rome area. The absence of marine Quaternary sediments among the xenolith types suggests that the Colli Albani area was continental before the onset of volcanism...|$|R
