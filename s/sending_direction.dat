40|$|Digital {{recordings}} of our activities {{are constantly being}} stored and processed in information systems, and are increasingly getting more valuable for investigating illegal activities. A problem we are facing today {{is the amount of}} manual labor required in order to look through this evergrowing amount of data. This process is time consuming and error prone. Tools and methods for speeding up the process are needed, and they must be capable of aiding both identification and correlation of the evidence. An indirect benefit is reduction in human error by freeing up human cognitive processing. The topic of this thesis is email investigation and how visualization techniques can support it. Data visualizations can help humans spot trends, correlations and anomalies in the data. Anomalies are of particular interest, {{based on the assumption that}} illegal behavior can be detected indirectly based on outlier characteristics of meta data. Two sources of email data are used. The primary source is the Enron dataset consisting of approximately 150 corporate accounts. The second data source is a private Gmail account synchronized via Microsoft Outlook. The research methodology comprises design, implementation and testing of a modular framework for email investigation. It has three main parts: Standardization of email format, extraction of meta data and a web based interface. Preliminary testing comprises demonstration of designed techniques using the Enron dataset, verification of email parsing using the Gmail account and lastly verification of visualization results using a commercial tool called Tableau. Standardizing on a common format before meta data extraction eases the process of adding support for new or changing email storage formats. Important steps in meta data extraction are removal of duplicates, determination of owners’ email address(es) and determination of direction. Deleted messages that still remain in other user accounts can be recovered. Email accounts that have not been collected can partly be rebuilt based on the same principle. Extracted meta data have been imported to the commercial tool Tableau which proves to be an efficient environment for prototyping visualizations. Important findings for interaction and visualization are the benefits of interlinking visualizations with the underlying data. Interlinking both in time and across email accounts. The <b>sending</b> <b>direction</b> of a message is important when visualizing the time of day or number of messages per day since sent messages correlate stronger with user actions than received messages. Moving analysis of email from a desktop application to a web portal opens up for new ways to collaborate. Investigators can see what messages has been read by others and important messages can be added to a shared case timeline. A working prototype with support of Microsoft Outlook *. pst files has been prepared, and can be used for further research...|$|E

They first ask Ja-sung to leak incriminating evidence about Jung. Then they go to Jung, and convince him to leak evidence about his rival Lee in exchange for not being prosecuted.

40|$|Ashok Jain, Advisor to the NITI Aayog, {{has called}} for {{reviewing}} some subsidies in the marine fisheries sector as a primary step to effectively manage marine resources. The impact of various types of subsidies should be analysed prior to formulating a sustainable marine ecosystem management, {{he said at the}} opening session of a two-day national workshop on inclusive management of marine ecosystems at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. The subsidies, which are leading to overfishing or illegal fishing, should be eliminated for the sustainable development of marine fisheries, he added. Referring to the delay by States in implementing the latest technologies, he said the NITI Aayog would <b>send</b> <b>directions</b> regarding this to the States directly. “India is committed to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) set by the UN. We have to look into the possibilities of sustainable marine tourism towards achieving the SDG- 14, which is related to ocean resources,” he said. A Gopalakrishnan, CMFRI Director, stressed on the need to sustainably manage marine resources. Globally, the market value of marine and coastal resources and industries is estimated at 3 trillion per year, which is 5 per cent of global GDP. The workshop is being jointly organised by the NITI Aayog, CMFRI and the WWF-India...|$|R

30|$|In this article, we {{consider}} a MU-MIMO downlink system with minor levels of feedback {{in which each}} user <b>sends</b> channel <b>direction</b> information (CDI) quantized by a log 2 M-sized codebook instead of by the large predefined CDI codebook used in SUS. Furthermore, to reduce the feedback overhead for CQI, we propose a small-sized CQI quantizer based on the closed-form expression of the CQI of selected users. It is shown that the proposed quantizer provides a point of reference for the quantizing boundaries of CQI feedback and reflects the sum-rate growth resulting from multiuser diversity with only 1 or 2 bits. The proposed CQI quantizer operates well with minor levels of feedback.|$|R

40|$|Astrology {{has long}} {{argued that the}} {{alignment}} of the planets governs human affairs. Science usually scoffs at this. There is, however, an important exception: sending spacecraft for planetary exploration. In late May and early June, 2003, Mars will be in position for Earth launch. Two Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) will rocket towards the red planet. The rovers will perform a series of geological and meteorological experiments, seeking to examine geological evidence for water and conditions once favorable for life. Back on earth, {{a small army of}} surface operations staff will work to keep the rovers running, <b>sending</b> <b>directions</b> for each day's operations and receiving the files encoding the outputs of the Rover's six instruments. (Mars is twenty light minutes from Earth. The rovers must be robots.) The fundamental purpose of the project is, after all, Science. Scientists have experiments they want to run. Ideally, scientists want to be immediately notified when the data products of their experiments have been received, so that they can examine their data and (collaboratively) deduce results. Mars is an unpredictable environment. We may issue commands to the rovers but there is considerable uncertainty in how the commands will be executed and whether what the rovers sense will be worthy of further pursuit. The steps of what is, to a scientist, conceptually an individual experiment may be scattered over a large number of activities. While the scientific staff has an overall strategic idea of what it would like to accomplish, activities are planned daily. The data and surprises of the previous day need to be integrated into the negotiations for the next day's activities, all synchronized to a schedule of transmission windows. Negotiations is the operative term, as different scientists want the resources to run possibly incompatible experiments. Many meetings plan each day's activities...|$|R
