40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} case of 22 -year-old man with nontraumatic intracystic {{hemorrhage}} into a middle cranial fossa arachnoid cyst associated with a contiguous <b>subacute</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma.</b> Arachnoid cysts are benign intra-arachnoidal fluid collections frequently detected incidentally during neuroimaging. Rare complications of arachnoid cysts such as intracystic hemorrhage or subdural hematomas and subdural hygromas typically occur after head trauma. Our {{review of the literature}} identified fewer than 30 cases of arachnoid cysts with complicating intracystic hemorrhage and ipsilateral subdural hematomas...|$|E
40|$|A {{patient with}} a history of pain, paresthesias, and {{weakness}} in both legs is reported. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine demonstrated <b>subacute</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma.</b> Brain MRI obtained 1 day later because of progressive headache showed hemorrhagic cortical metastasis and extensive subdural hematoma. It is hypothesized that the lumbar hematoma originated from the intracranial bleeding, which was substantiated by the observation of a thin hemorrhagic collection connecting cranial and lumbar hematomas on MRI. Cranial origin {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis of spontaneous spinal subdural hematomas...|$|E
40|$|Arachnoid cysts are {{developmental}} anomalies {{which are}} usually asymptomatic. Intracystic hemorrhage after trauma is a well known complication; however, spontaneous intracystic hemorrhage is rare. This report presents two rare cases of arachnoid cyst complicated by spontaneous intracystic hemorrhage. The first patient was admitted following transient loss of consciousness and speech disturbance, and a <b>subacute</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> at the left temporal region was diagnosed. The second patient presented with severe headache of four days duration and a subdural hematoma at the left temporoparietal region was diagnosed. In both the patients, both on radiological examination and during surgical intervention, hematomas {{were found to be}} intracystic...|$|E
30|$|The {{development}} time of these hematomas is especially variable. They {{can be detected}} immediately following trauma, but can also appear months later. With the assistance of histological investigations, the following classification {{has proven to be}} valuable (Firsching et al. 1989): i) acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> within the first 24  h after trauma; ii) <b>subacute</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> between 2 and 10  days following TBI; and iii) chronic <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> after the 10 th day following TBI. Depending on the time interval, the density of the hematomas is variable. Acute hemorrhage occurs usually hyperintense on CT scan, whereas chronic hemorrhage can appear isodense and, therefore, difficult to detect.|$|R
40|$|An 80 -year-old {{man with}} a history of Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus was hospitalized due to generalized convulsive status epilepticus. Initially, hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis were diagnosed, but his seizures were refractory to the medical treatment. Additionally, a high level of serum theophylline (29. 1 mg/mL) was detected. Following detoxification of theophylline by oral activated charcoal, the patient regained consciousness and was free from seizures without antiepileptic drug treatment. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed <b>subacute</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> at the bilateral occipital hemispheres. This case suggests that theophylline toxicity may be a predisposing factor for seizures in patients {{with a history of}} traumatic brain injury in spite of the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis that may have an anticonvulsant action...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) and {{computed tomography}} (CT) imagings were compared in 121 patients with various neurologic diseases. MR was performed with either 0. 15 Tesla resistive or 2. 0 Tesla superconducting systems developed by Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), using multi-slice spin echo technique {{with a variety}} of pulse sequences reflecting proton density, T 1 and T 2 relaxation times. MR was more advantageous in the detection of the lesions, accurate depiction of the lesion extents, and/or demonstration of anatomic details in sagittal or coronal plane in 36 of the 121 patients. These included white matter diseases, cervical cord tumors, syringomyelia, brain stem tumors, foramen magnum tumor, acute cerebellar infarction, Chiari malformation, isodense <b>subacute</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas,</b> cavernous hemangioma, A-V malformation with hemorrhage and some unknown pathologies. Even though 2. 0 T superconducting system showed greater capability of demonstrating the anatomic details and contrast discrimination between normal and abnormal tissues, the ability of MR to separate the tumor from the edema and to differentiate among different pathologic entities remained to be further evaluated. CT was superior to MR in 13 patients with acute intracranial hematomas, small calcific lesions, inflammatory granulomas or meningiomas. CT takes less time and may be preferable in very young or elderly patients. Both MR and CT gave equivalent information in the remaining patients.

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{intention of}} this thesis {{was to give}} an overview of clinical and radiological aspects influencing the outcome of patients with acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma.</b> Of special interest was the outcome of patients with coagulopathy. Included the retrospective analysis were the records of 319 patients aged 1 - 100 who had been treated for acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> in the UKB between 2001 and 2007. Patients with spontaneously occurring <b>subacute</b> or chronic <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> {{were excluded from the}} analysis. 16 clinical and radiological parameters as well as their influence of the patient`s outcome were examined. The overall lethality was 40, 4 %. Clinical aspects influencing the lethality were a pathological motility of the pupils and an initially low Glasgow-Coma-Scale-Score. In addition, the outcome was negatively influenced by the thickness of the hematoma, occurring midline shifts, contusions, their diameter and number, subarachnoidal bleeding, polytrauma and pathologic coagulation (INR,pTT,TZ). The combination of midline shifts larger than 20 mm as well as an initial GCS-Score of 3 - 5 and a bilateral mydriasis turned out to be fatal in every case. There was no significant effect on the patients` outcome for anticoagulative therapy. It could not be eliminated for sure though that more patients than registered had taken anticoagulative medication. Based on the laboratory parameters it could not be reconstructed if patients were suffering from iatrigenicly caused coagulopathy. However coagulopathy does have a negative influence on the prognosis of acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> in general as shown by the results...|$|R

As part of the transcatheter aortic valve implantation work-up, he underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram, which showed a calcific, degenerative severe aortic stenosis (mean gradient, 45 mm Hg; max aortic valve velocity, 4. 3 m/s; and aortic valve area, 0. 8 cm 2) with associated moderate regur-gitation. There was preserved left ventricular function with concentric hypertrophy. The mechanical mitral valve was functioning well with a mean transvalvular gradient of 5 mm Hg and no paravalvular leaks. There were no prominent mechanical mitral valve pivot guards protruding in the left ventricular outflow tract (Figure 1 A– 1 C).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients {{who have}} benign {{enlargement}} of the subarachnoid spaces (BESS) have long been suspected of having an increased propensity for <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> either spontaneously or {{as a result of}} accidental injury. <b>Subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> in infants are often equated with nonaccidental trauma (NAT). A better understanding of the clinical and imaging characteristics of <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> that occur either spontaneously or as a result of accidental trauma may help distinguish this group of patients from those who suffer <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> as a result of NAT. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the clinical and imaging characteristics of <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> that occur either spontaneously or as a result of accidental injury in infants with BESS.

The aim of our study is to describe the current practice among radiologists in the Netherlands regarding the age determination of <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> in children. This is a cross-sectional study, describing the results of an online questionnaire regarding dating <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> among pediatric and neuro-radiologists in the Netherlands. The questionnaire consisted of sociodemographic questions, theoretical questions and eight pediatric cases in which {{the participants were asked to}} date <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> based on imaging findings.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Symptomatic <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> {{development}} is a constant concern for patients who have undergone cerebrospinal fluid shunting procedures to relieve symptoms related to normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> are of particular concern in these patients as even minor head trauma may result in <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> formation. The presence of a ventricular shunt facilitates further expansion of the <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> and often necessitates surgical treatment, including <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> evacuation and shunt ligation. Case presentation We present {{the case of a}} 63 -year-old North American Caucasian man with normal-pressure hydrocephalus with an adjustable valve ventriculoperitoneal shunt who developed an acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> after sustaining head trauma. Conservative treatment was favored over operative evacuation because our patient was neurologically intact, but simple observation was considered to be too high risk in the setting of a low-pressure ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Thus, the valve setting on the ventriculoperitoneal shunt was increased to its maximum pressure setting in order to reduce flow through the shunt and to mildly increase intracranial pressure in an attempt to tamponade any active bleeding and limit hematoma expansion. A repeat computed tomography scan of the head six days after the valve adjustment revealed complete resolution of the acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma.</b> At this time, the valve pressure was reduced to its original setting to treat symptoms of normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Conclusions Programmable shunt valves afford the option for non-operative management of acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> in patients with ventricular shunts for normal-pressure hydrocephalus. As illustrated in this case report, increasing the shunt valve pressure may result in rapid resolution of the acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> in some patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|Among 126 {{cases of}} chronic <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma,</b> 6 cases (4. 8 %) were {{diagnosed}} as acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> in chronic stage.

All of them received major {{trauma to the}} head, but surgical treatment was not necessary until a mean period of 22. 7 days, ranging from 17 to 30 days. Acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> in its chronic stage has subdural granulation tissue {{similar to that of}} the outer membrane of chronic <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma.</b> This membrane was formed in the dural surface of the hematoma and was partially liquefied near the arachnoidal surface, but none of them had a macroscopically well-formed inner membrane. The subdural granulation tissue was of irregular thickness ranging from 1 - 2 mm, and was tightly adhered to the hematoma. Histologically, the granulation tissue consisted mainly of old fibrous connective tissue, having less capillaries than the outer membrane, and with scant blood components and few inflammatory cells. Pigments such as hemosiderin or hematoidin, and macrophages laden with these pigments accumulated in the granulation tissue, while new hemorrhagic foci were rare around the capillaries. The border layer between the subdural granulation tissue and the hematoma was generally irregular and not clearly discriminated, where many fibroblasts with mitotic figures and the macrophages irregularly accumulated. Thus, acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> in chronic stage differed from chronic <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma,</b> both in its clinical and pathological aspects. The results suggest that the existence of an inner membrane plays an important role in defining the chronicity of <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas.</b> It is advisable to investigate not only the clinical course, but also the existence of an inner membrane and the histology of the subdural granulation tissue in order to differentiate acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> in chronic stage from chronic <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma...</b>|$|R

A further study was done on this last group of patients. Men were more numerous than women and this difference is greater than on a general ward. The percentage of children is also less in the ICU than on a general ward. It seems like young men are most prone to have serious head injuries. The most common injury in adults was a localized contusion and/or laceration. In children this lesion as well as diffuse cerebral injury were equally common. The two most common causes of accidents were falls and traffic accidents. This applies to acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> and localized cerebral contusion and/or laceration. The {{most common cause of}} epidural <b>hematoma,</b> <b>subacute</b> and chronic <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> was a fall. The most common cause of diffuse brain injury were traffic accidents. Other causes are rather uncommon and it is especially interesting that assaults and gunshot injuries are very unusual as causes of serious head injuries. Even the gunshot injuries were almost always a suicidal attempt. Traffic accidents are {{the most common cause of}} serious head injuries in children and the only cause of consequent serious disability or death in children. Condition of the patients on admission, examination and studies, treatment and results are discussed. Six types of intracranial bleeding and cerebral contusion are considered and discussed in details. Á árunum 1973 - 1980 voru 1435 sjúklingar lagðir inn á Borgarspítalann vegna höfuðáverka og hefir verið fjallað um þennan hóp frá ýmsum sjónarhornum áður (1 - 4). Fjögur hundruð tuttugu og fimm þeirra voru vistaðir á gjörgæsludeild. Við gerð þessarar greinar var þessum sjúklingum skipt í tvo hópa: a) þá sem höfðu fengið slæman heilahristing og b) þá sem hlotið höfðu alvarlega höfuðáverka, heilamar eða blæðingu...|$|R

An experimental model was developed that demonstrated that blood with reduced hemoglobin concentration, 8 - 10 g l dl, is isodense with the brain. Two anemic patients with acute isodense <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> are reported. Isodense or isoattenuating <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> have proven to be a difficult diagnostic problem and {{have been the subject of}} numerous reports [1 - 1 3]. The time that a chronic subdural collection may become isodense on computed tomography (CT) varies from 1 week to 90 days after trauma [3, 5, 8]. In most instances, it appears isodense in 2 - 6 weeks [6]. There has been littl e mention of isodense <b>subdural</b> <b>hematomas</b> in the acute c linica l setting. In patients with low hemoglobin leve ls, an acute <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> may be isodense from the outset. We developed an experimental model to define the rang e of hemoglobin concentration that would be isodense with the brain in the acute setting.

We describe a case of <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> developing following spinal anesthesia and diagnosed late. A female patient receiving spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery 45 days prior to arrival at the emergency department presented to our hospital with non-severe headache persisting for 45 days after discharge. Computerized tomography (CT) of the brain performed due to long-term persisting headache resistant to medical treatment {{and a history of}} spinal intervention revealed a hypodense chronic <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> in the left frontoparietal area and a shift from left to right in midline structures. The patient was operated and discharged without sequelae on the 7 th day postoperatively. Care must be taken over <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> in the presence of headache after spinal anesthesia persisting despite fluid intake and medical treatment and exceeding 48 h in duration, and diagnosis must not be delayed.
