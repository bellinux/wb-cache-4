5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted {{by the first}} manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result of}} his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, diazepam, <b>secobarbital,</b> methaqualone, methylphenidate, Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions.|$|E
25|$|Eli Lilly has {{manufactured}} <b>Secobarbital,</b> a barbiturate derivative with anaesthetic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties.

25|$|Drug users tend {{to prefer}} short-acting and intermediate-acting barbiturates. The most {{commonly}} used are amobarbital (Amytal), pentobarbital (Nembutal), and <b>secobarbital</b> (Seconal). A combination of amobarbital and <b>secobarbital</b> (called Tuinal) is also highly used. Short-acting and intermediate-acting barbiturates are usually prescribed as sedatives and sleeping pills. These pills begin acting fifteen to forty minutes after they are swallowed, and their effects last from five to six hours.|$|E

25|$|Barbiturates {{induce a}} number of hepatic CYP enzymes (most notably CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4), leading to exaggerated effects from many prodrugs and {{decreased}} effects from drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes to inactive metabolites. This can result in fatal overdoses from drugs such as codeine, tramadol, and carisoprodol, which become considerably more potent after being metabolized by CYP enzymes. Although all known {{members of the class}} possess relevant enzyme induction capabilities the degree of inhibition overall as well as the impact on each specific enzyme span a broad range with phenobarbital and <b>secobarbital</b> being the most potent enzyme inducers and butalbital and talbutal being among the weakest enzyme inducers in the class.|$|E

The combination medication Fioricet, consisting of butalbital, caffeine, and paracetamol (acetaminophen), however, is specifically exempted from controlled substance status, while its sibling Fiorinal, which contains aspirin instead of paracetamol and may contain codeine phosphate, remains a schedule III drug.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, [...] the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 {{classified}} most barbiturates as controlled substances—and {{they remain}} so [...] Barbital, methylphenobarbital (also known as mephobarbital), and phenobarbital are designated schedule IV drugs, and [...] "Any substance which contains any quantity of a derivative of barbituric acid, or any salt of a derivative of barbituric acid" [...] (all other barbiturates) were designated as schedule III.

50|$|<b>Secobarbital</b> {{was widely}} misused in the 1960s and 1970s, and {{accidental}} overdose {{was associated with}} the drug.

Consequently, the prescription of Seconal decreased greatly, beginning in the early 1980s by which time benzodiazepines had become increasingly common. <b>Secobarbital</b> has acquired many nicknames, the most common being “reds,” “red devils,” or “red dillies” (because of the color of the capsules). Other common nicknames are “seccies,” “Cardinals,” “ruby slippers,” and, according to the Wegman’s School of Pharmacy curriculum, “red hearts.” A less common nickname is “dolls”; this was partly responsible for the title of Jacqueline Susann’s novel Valley of the Dolls, whose main characters use <b>secobarbital</b> and other such drugs.|$|E
