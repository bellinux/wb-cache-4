5|$|When Japan's {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 led to U.S. entry into World War II, blood donor projects, stamp and bond drives, and the {{dedication}} of service flags gave the City College a wartime atmosphere. More than three-quarters of the <b>students</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> the Victory Corps, which sponsored courses in communications, map reading, judo {{and the study of}} the poisonous and non-poisonous plants on Pacific islands. By the time the war ended in 1945, 4,667 City College students had served in the armed forces, 204 of whom lost their lives. The names of all of the fallen, including two Medal of Honor recipients, are inscribed on a bronze memorial, which sits today {{in the center of the}} school.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Queen's {{separated}} from the Presbyterian Church of Scotland and {{changed its name to}} Queen's University at Kingston. Queen's Theological College remained in the control of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, until 1925, when it joined the United Church of Canada, where it remains today. The university faced another financial crisis during World War I, from a sharp drop in enrolment due to the military enlistment of students, staff, and faculty. A $1,000,000 fundraising drive and the armistice in 1918 saved the university. Approximately 1,500 <b>students</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> the war and 187 died. Months before Canada joined World War II, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, came to Queen's to accept an honorary degree and, in a broadcast heard around the world, voiced the American policy of mutual alliance and friendship with Canada. During World War II, 2,917 graduates from Queen's served in the armed forces, suffering 164 fatalities. The Memorial Room in Memorial Hall of the John Deutsch University Centre lists those Queen's students who died during the world wars.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Shelton House, a {{building}} across Elm Road, was purchased as a dormitory, and a classroom and office wing was dedicated in 1951. In 1955, after Howard Deering Johnson joined {{the board of}} trustees, the dormitory Howard Johnson Hall was built. From 1963, Briarcliff College rapidly expanded, constructing two dormitories, the fine arts and humanities building, the Woodward Science Building, and a 600-seat dining hall. In 1964, the college began offering the Bachelor of Arts and of Sciences degrees. The Center for Hudson Valley Archaeology was opened in 1964. Enrollment at the college jumped from around 300 to over 500 from 1960 to 1964; by 1967, enrollment was at 623, with 240 freshmen. During the Vietnam War, students protested US involvement, and Adkins and trustees resigned; James E. Stewart became president. In 1969, twelve students, led by student president Edie Cullen, stole the college mimeograph machines and gave nine demands to the college. The next day, around 50 <b>students</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> a 48-hour sit-in at Dow Hall. Josiah Bunting III became president in 1973 and Pace University and New York Medical College of Valhalla began leasing campus buildings. The college had 350 students in 1977, and students enjoyed half-empty dormitory buildings.|$|E

40|$|Ajzen’s (1985) Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was {{referred}} to as the architecture by this study, using SEM to construct the behavioral tendency causal model for university <b>students</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> in-line hockey. The university <b>students</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> in-line hockey were taken as the research subjects and Ajzen’s (1985) Theory of Planned Behavior was used as the reference. In addition, the modified planned behavior scale of behavior attitude scale for college and university <b>students</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> tennis proposed by Chang and Lai (2005) were adopted as the research tool. The scale was found to feature good convergent validity, discriminate validity and composite reliability. The research results indicate that H 1 attitude of university <b>students</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> in-line hockey has a positive impact towards behavioral tendency with a path coefficient of. 43 (p. 01), and so H 2 is not supported. H 3 perceived behavioral control of university <b>students</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> in-line hockey has a positive impact towards behavioral tendency with a path coefficient of. 54 (p<. 01), and so H 3 is supported. The results have verified that the measurement invariance assessment for college and university <b>students</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> in-line hockey is incongruence between male and female groups...|$|R
5|$|To prepare aircrew {{for their}} {{rotation}} through No.2 Squadron in Vietnam, No.1OCU <b>students</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> exercises such as Combat Skyspot in August 1968, which utilised radar controlled by No.30 Squadron, and Strait Kris in September–October 1969, {{in conjunction with}} the Australian Army. The unit lost two more aircrew when a Canberra M.21 on a training flight crashed near Amberley on 23March 1970. From 21March to 25April 1971, four of the unit's aircraft flew 10,000 miles around Australia to conduct seven flying displays as part of the RAAF's Golden Jubilee celebrations. Having completed thirty-six conversion courses in its twelve years of operation, No.1OCU was disbanded on 9June 1971, following the withdrawal of No.2 Squadron from Vietnam. Unit staff were transferred to No.2 Squadron, which continued to operate the Canberra and carry out its own operational conversion until disbanding in June 1982. Ten of No.1 OCU's fifteen Canberras were put into storage and the remainder, including surviving Mk.21 trainers, were taken on by No.2 Squadron. When the F-111C eventually entered service with No.82 Wing in 1973, No.6 Squadron again took responsibility for conversion training, while No.1 Squadron acted as the lead strike unit. Canberra A84-236, which was allocated to No.1OCU in 1968 and 1970 when not in service with No.2 Squadron in Vietnam, went on display at RAAF Museum, Point Cook, Victoria, in 1982.|$|E

There will be no significant differences in the straight-copy stroking speeds achieved by <b>students</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> progressive practice skill building procedures and <b>students</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> paced practice skill building procedures. 2.
