5|$|As the 19th century progressed, the {{increasing}} need for large freight carriers led to Liverpool's dominance as a port. Manchester became increasingly reliant on its Merseyside neighbour for its imports and exports, but the handling charges and dues {{charged by the}} Mersey Docks and Harbour Board made goods from Manchester uncompetitive. A solution was to build the Manchester <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal.</b> In 1887 the Bridgewater Navigation Company was purchased by the Manchester <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> Company with a cheque for £1,710,000, which {{was at the time}} the largest cheque ever written, and the building of the Manchester <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> began.|$|E
5|$|Significant change {{occurred}} when the Manchester <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> was opened in 1894. The tidal section of the river below Frodsham now flowed into the <b>ship</b> <b>canal,</b> rather than the River Mersey, and the exit lock from Weston Docks also joined the canal rather than the estuary. A new ship lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which provided a more convenient route to the <b>ship</b> <b>canal</b> than the alternative route through Weston Point docks. The Weston Canal has been little used since. Although {{it is possible for}} pleasure craft to reach the Weaver from the <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal,</b> it is a commercial waterway, and most leisure users are dissuaded from doing so by the amount of paperwork and the requirements of the operating company.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Adamson, {{promoter}} of the Manchester <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal,</b> {{lived at the}} Towers (blue plaque – once the Shirley Institute) on Wilmslow Road from 1874 {{until his death in}} 1890. His Grade II listed home, designed by Thomas Worthington for John Edward Taylor, the editor and proprietor of the Manchester Guardian, was the venue for the 1882 meeting at which it was decided to construct the <b>ship</b> <b>canal</b> project.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} British canals, the Manchester <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> was never nationalised. In 1984 Salford City Council used a {{derelict}} land grant {{to purchase the}} docks at Salford from the <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> Company, rebranding the area as Salford Quays. Principal developers Urban Waterside began redevelopment work the following year, by which time traffic on the canal's upper reaches had declined {{to such an extent}} that its owners considered closing it above Runcorn. In 1993 the <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> Company was acquired by Peel Holdings; as of 2014 it is owned and operated by Peel Ports, which also owns the Port of Liverpool. The company announced a £50billion Atlantic Gateway plan in 2011 to develop the Port of Liverpool and the Manchester <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> as a way of combating increasing road congestion. Their scheme involves the construction of a large distribution centre to be named Port Salford and an additional six sites along the canal for the loading and unloading of freight. Peel Ports predict that the number of containers transported along the canal could increase from the 8,000 carried in 2010 to 100,000 by 2030.|$|E
5|$|Warburton Bridge is {{a privately}} owned {{statutory}} tolled undertaking which incorporates a public highway road length. The high-level cantilever bridge crosses the Manchester <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> on the B5159 road, connecting the A57 with the A6144, and was commissioned under the Rixton & Warburton Bridge Act 1863. The original stone bridge spanned the River Mersey {{prior to its}} later diversion into the Manchester <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal.</b> Both bridges and the unadopted approach roads are privately maintained. It {{is one of the}} few remaining pre-motorway toll bridges in the United Kingdom, and the only one in Greater Manchester.|$|E

5|$|With the {{predicted}} traffic for the canal slow to materialise, Hooley and Marshall Stevens (the {{general manager of}} the <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> Company) came to see the benefits that the industrial development of Trafford Park could offer to both the <b>ship</b> <b>canal</b> and the estate. In January 1897 Stevens became the managing director of Trafford Park Estates, where he remained until 1930, latterly as its joint chairman and managing director.|$|E

The Manchester <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> runs alongside the Runcorn bank of the River Mersey; the Bridgewater Canal terminates in the canal basin in the town centre, as the staircase of locks leading down to the <b>ship</b> <b>canal</b> was filled in many decades ago.|$|E
5|$|The canal company {{exhausted}} {{its capital}} of £8 million in 4 years, when {{only half the}} construction work was completed. To avoid bankruptcy they appealed for funds to Manchester Corporation, which set up a <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> Committee. On 9 March 1891 the corporation decided, on the committee's recommendation, to lend the necessary £3 million, to preserve the city's prestige. In return the corporation was allowed to appoint five of the fifteen {{members of the board}} of directors. The company subsequently raised its estimates of the cost of completion in September 1891 and again in June 1892. An executive committee was appointed as an emergency measure in December 1891, and on 14 October 1892 the <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> Committee resolved to lend a further £1.5million on condition that Manchester Corporation had an absolute majority on the canal company's board of directors and its various sub-committees. The corporation subsequently appointed 11 of the 21 seats, nominated Alderman Sir John Harwood as deputy director of the company, and secured majorities on five of the board's six sub-committees. The cost to Manchester Corporation of financing the <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> Company {{had a significant impact on}} local taxpayers. Manchester's municipal debt rose by 67 per cent, resulting in a 26 per cent increase in rates between 1892 and 1895.|$|E

Hooley's plan was to develop the <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> frontage, but the canal was slow to generate the predicted volume of traffic, so {{in the early days}} the park was largely used for leisure activities such as golf, polo and boating. British Westinghouse was the first major company to move in, and by 1903 it was employing about half of the 12,000workers then employed in the park, which {{became one of the most}} important engineering facilities in Britain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} {{situation of}} sea navigation in south East Asia {{focusing on the}} Strait of Malacca. The strait links the Indian and Pacific oceans, which {{is considered one of}} the busiest in several narrow channels around the world. The paper highlights the significance of the strait to global maritime trade, volume of traffic, and rising environmental and social consequences in the strait. A feasibility study of constructing a new <b>shipping</b> <b>canal</b> in the South Thai Kra Isthmus as an alternative option of Malacca route had been studied since 19 th century. The paper explores suitable sites for a potential <b>shipping</b> <b>canal</b> in the Kra Isthmus using physiographic spatial data i. e., elevation, sea charts, geology, soils and river systems. Each spatial data was considered as a separate decision variable for site evaluation. Separate evaluation criterions were prepared for each variable based on <b>shipping</b> <b>canal</b> requirements. Overlaying the maps in ArcGIS environment, the variables were carefully evaluated, and five geographic sites for the canal were derived. The length of the <b>shipping</b> <b>canal</b> over sea and land was computed for each site. Site B located in south of Ranong and Chumphon provinces, was found shortest one, whereas site C in Surat Thani, Pangnna and Krabi provinces, was the longest. However, each site consisted of benefits and constrains...|$|R

5|$|In the 1960s {{employment}} in the park began to decline as companies closed their premises in favour of newer, more efficient plants elsewhere. Ellesmere Port and Runcorn at {{the western end of}} the Manchester <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> were in the ascendency industrially and they overtook Trafford Park in economic importance. In 1967, employment had fallen to 50,000 and there was a further decline in the 1970s. In 1971, Stretford Council responded by setting up the Trafford Park Industrial Council (TRAFIC), membership of which was open to any firm in Trafford Park. One of TRAFIC's early initiatives was to encourage businesses in the park to address the general air of decay, by improving their own areas through landscaping and other environmental improvements. The park's decline was exacerbated by the decreasing use of the Manchester <b>Ship</b> <b>Canal</b> during the 1970s, which was unable to accommodate the newer, larger container ships then entering service. By 1976, the workforce had fallen to 15,000, and by the 1980s industry had virtually disappeared.|$|E
