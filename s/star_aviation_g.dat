40|$|In {{connection}} {{with the increase in}} air traffic, IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) flight in the air traffic control system has become very demanding. It has, therefore, become imperative to optimize the pilot's skills in his management of the various aircraft systems. The present investigation is concerned with the human factors aspects of the use of sidesticks in direct mechanical linkage (reversible) control systems in a production General <b>Aviation</b> (<b>G.</b> A.) aircraft. A total of 140 fifteen to twenty minute flight tasks were flown on the NASA Langley G. A. motion base simulator. The study involved a comparison of three locations of the sidestick, left side, center, and right side, and the standard yoke. It was found that the sidestick is preferable to the standard yoke. However, some of the design and installation features of the sidestick are critical for pilot acceptance...|$|R

5|$|In 2000, Biman put out {{a request}} for {{proposal}} for the acquisition of four wide-bodied aircraft to replace the DC–10s, but both the fleet renewal plans and the airline's expected privatisation were shelved by the government. A further attempt was made in 2005 to acquire new aircraft and plans were submitted {{for the purchase of}} ten new wide-bodied Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a total cost of $1billion. Boeing arranged to finance the purchase provided a guarantee was given by the Bangladesh government. After bureaucratic delays and a perceived lack of commitment from the government, Boeing lost interest and the plans were cancelled. A similar attempt to purchase medium-haul aircraft for domestic service was also postponed. In , Biman {{put out a}} tender for the dry lease of two Airbus A310-300 and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft for two years.

40|$|Past {{research}} has demonstrated the substantial potential of synthetic and enhanced vision (SV, EV) for <b>aviation</b> (e. <b>g.,</b> Prinzel & Wickens, 2009). These augmented visual-based technologies {{have been shown to}} significantly enhance situation awareness, reduce workload, enhance <b>aviation</b> safety (e. <b>g.,</b> reduced propensity for controlled flight -into-terrain accidents/incidents), and promote flight path control precision. The issues that drove the design and development of synthetic and enhanced vision have commonalities to other application domains; most notably, during entry, descent, and landing on the moon and other planetary surfaces. NASA has extended SV/EV technology for use in planetary exploration vehicles, such as the Altair Lunar Lander.
