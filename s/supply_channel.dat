50|$|Drain back level basins (DBLB) or contour basins are {{a variant}} of basin {{irrigation}} where the field is divided {{into a number of}} terraced rectangular bays which are graded level or have no significant slope. Water is applied to the first bay (usually the highest in elevation) and when the desired depth is applied water is permitted to drain back off that bay and flow to the next bay which is at a lower elevation than the first. Each bay is irrigated in turn using a combination of drainage water from the previous bay and continuing inflow from the <b>supply</b> <b>channel.</b> Successful operation of these systems is reliant on a sufficient elevation drop between successive bays. These systems are commonly used in Australia where rice and wheat are grown in rotation.|$|E

Huge resources are required to accommodate presales and postsales issues of individual consumers. Before disintermediation, supply chain middlemen acted as salespeople for the producers.

50|$|The {{navigation}} {{gradually became}} more profitable, and although railways arrived at Driffield in 1846, the navigation continued to prosper and increase its traffic until the 1870s, after {{which there was}} a gradual decline.

Following proposals {{to use it as a}} water <b>supply</b> <b>channel</b> in 1959, the Driffield Navigation Amenities Association was formed in 1968, with the aim of restoring the waterway to a navigable condition. One problem was that there was no longer a legal body responsible for the assets, and so the Driffield Navigation Trust was formed, which took over the role of the original commissioners. Since that time, most of the navigation has been returned to a navigable condition, although there are still some obstacles to its full use, caused by bridges which have been lowered or built since the 1950s.|$|E

5000|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 19th century, Chennai city {{received}} water from shallow wells and tanks, such as the Nungambakkam tank, in the region. The first proposal to tap water from Kortalayar river situated about 160 km northwest of the city was forwarded by Fraser, a civil engineer. The [...] 1.85-million project involved construction of a masonry weir across Kortalayar river at Tamaraipakkam and diverting the water into Cholavaram lake and further into the Red Hills lake by means of a channel. This established the first scientifically designed water distribution system in the city. The primary works were completed in 1870, and in 1872, a valve house at Red Hills and a gravity-aided earthen <b>supply</b> <b>channel</b> to supply water were built. Within the city, water was delivered by gravity into a masonry shaft at Kilpauk, where the channel ended. From here, the cast iron mains of the city branched off to carry water to different parts of the city. According to J. W. Madeley, a pioneer of Chennai water supply and sewerage system during 1914-1918, these were considered sufficient for an anticipated population of 660,000 in 1961 at a rate of 25 gallons per head per day. However, the need for further improvement was felt in 1936.|$|E
5000|$|The weir was an {{important}} factor in the retention of the canal to Llangollen when the owners of the entire Shropshire Union system, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, decided to close much of the network in 1944. They retained the line of the former Chester Canal and the Ellesmere Canal from Nantwich to Ellesmere Port, the branch of the Chester Canal to Middlewich and the former Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal main line from Nantwich to Wolverhampton. Because Horseshoe Falls was a major source of water to that system, the canal from Llangollen to Nantwich, including the great aqueducts at Pontcysyllte and Chirk, was retained purely as a water <b>supply</b> <b>channel.</b> This action enabled the canal to survive until it was taken over by British Waterways following nationalisation in 1948. With the steady decline in commercial traffic, British Waterways negotiated with the Mid and South East Cheshire Water Board, and the canal is used to transfer water from the Dee at Llantysilio to a reservoir near Hurleston Junction, to the north of Nantwich. In 2009, some [...] per day was conveyed along the canal. Under British Waterways, the canal {{has become one of the}} most popular cruising canals in the country. The final 1.7 mi from Llangollen to the Falls is not navigable by motorised boats, as it is not wide enough for vessels to turn round, but the towpath extends along the bank right up to the Falls.|$|E
50|$|Linux on z {{gives the}} {{flexibility}} of running Linux with the advantages of fault-tolerant mainframe hardware capable of over 90,000 I/O operations per second and with a {{mean time between failure}} (MTBF) measured in decades. Using virtualization, numerous smaller servers can be combined onto one mainframe, gaining some benefits of centralization and cost reduction, while still allowing specialized servers. Instead of paravirtualization, IBM mainframes use full virtualization, which permits workload density far greater than paravirtualization does. Combining full virtualization of the hardware plus lightweight Virtual Machine containers that run Linux in isolation (somewhat similar in concept to Docker) result in a platform that supports more virtual servers than any other in a single footprint, which also can lower operating costs. Additional savings can be seen from reduced need for floor space, power, cooling, networking hardware, and the other infrastructure needed to support a data center. IBM mainframes allow transparent use of redundant processor execution steps and integrity checking, which is important for critical applications in certain industries such as banking.. Mainframes typically allow hot-swapping of hardware, such as processors and memory. z Systems provides fault tolerance for all key components, including processors, memory, I/O Interconnect, power <b>supply,</b> <b>channel</b> paths, network cards, and others. Through internal monitoring, possible problems are detected and problem components are designed to be switched over without even failing a single transaction. In the rare event of failure, firmware will automatically enable a spare component, disable the failing component, and notify IBM to dispatch a service representative. This is transparent to the operating system, allowing routine repairs to be performed without shutting down the system. Industries continue to rely on mainframes because they are genuinely the best option, in terms of reliability, security, and often cost.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} robust methods, {{demonstrated}} up to date, of accelerating electron beams by laser-plasma sources is the utilization of plasma channels generated by the capillary discharges. These channels, i. e., plasma columns with a minimum density along the laser pulse propagation axis, may optically guide short laser pulses, thereby increasing the acceleration length, leading to a more efficient electron acceleration. Although the spatial structure of the installation is simple in principle, {{there may be some}} important effects caused by the open ends of the capillary, by the <b>supplying</b> <b>channels</b> etc., which require a detailed 3 D modeling of the processes taking place {{in order to get a}} detailed understanding and improve the operation. However, the discharge plasma, being one {{of the most}} crucial components of the laser-plasma accelerator, is not simulated with the accuracy and resolution required to advance this promising technology. In the present work, such simulations are performed using the code MARPLE. First, the process of the capillary filling with a cold hydrogen before the discharge is fired, through the side <b>supply</b> <b>channels</b> is simulated. The main goal of this simulation is to get a spatial distribution of the filling gas in the region near the open ends of the capillary. A realistic geometry is used for this and the next stage simulations, including the insulators, the <b>supplying</b> <b>channels</b> as well as the electrodes. Second, the simulation of the capillary discharge is performed with the goal to obtain a time-dependent spatial distribution of the electron density near the open ends of the capillary as well as inside the capillary. Finally, to evaluate effectiveness of the beam coupling with the channeling plasma wave guide and electron acceleration, modeling of laser-plasma interaction was performed with the code INF&RNOComment: 11 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
