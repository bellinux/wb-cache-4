5|$|Application {{of social}} {{sustainability}} requires stakeholders {{to look at}} human and labor rights, prevention of human trafficking, and other human rights risks. These issues {{should be considered in}} production and procurement of various worldwide commodities. The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services. The Equator Principles (financial industry), Fair Wear Foundation (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of <b>such</b> <b>organizations</b> and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such as Green Seal for cleaning products, NSF-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of Organic food in the United States.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Riverside Historic District, Jacksonville's first {{historic}} district, {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985; it now comprises 6870 acres and contains 2120 historic buildings. In 1989, the Avondale Historic District was added, and the following year the Jacksonville City Council established the Jacksonville Historic Preservation Commission in order to protect historic structures. Riverside Avondale Preservation has grown into one of the largest <b>such</b> <b>organizations</b> in the country. As a result of this focus on preservation and planning, the American Planning Association named Riverside and Avondale one of the country's top ten neighborhoods in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Groomed trail skiing {{occurs at}} facilities, such as Nordmarka (Oslo), Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort and Gatineau Park, Quebec, where trails {{are laid out}} and groomed for both classic and skate-skiing. Such {{grooming}} and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that adapt to {{the condition of the}} snow. Trail preparation employs snow machines that tow snow compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to the condition of the snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition of the snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets homologation standards for <b>such</b> <b>organizations</b> as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation or national standards. Standards address course distances, degree of difficulty with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors. Some facilities have night-time lighting on select trails—called lysløype (light trails) in Norwegian and elljusspår (electric light trails) in Swedish. The first lysløype were opened in 1946 in Nordmarka and at Byåsen (Trondheim).|$|E

Some people on maintenance therapies have veered away from <b>such</b> <b>organizations</b> as Narcotics Anonymous, instead opting {{to create their own}} twelve-step fellowships (such as Methadone Anonymous) or depart entirely from the twelve-step model of recovery, seeking a program which is secular and based on science (such as SMART Recovery) rather than faith.|$|E
