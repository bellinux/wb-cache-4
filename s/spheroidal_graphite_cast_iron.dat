40|$|Abstract Flake and {{spheroidal}} graphite cast irons with similar composition {{were subjected to}} high temperature oxidation to investigate graphite morphology and distribution effects on the oxidation behavior.

The {{flake graphite cast iron}} exhibited the worst high-temperature oxidation resistance compared with <b>spheroidal</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> Since graphite flakes provide suitable sites for the iron oxide growth and are almost interconnected, the iron oxide grows faster and penetrates along the graphite flakes boundaries resulting in the subsurface oxidation. Due to the severe subsurface oxidation flake graphite cast iron parabolic rate constants are five times higher than that of the <b>spheroidal</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> However, <b>spheroidal</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> parabolic rate constants and oxide layer thickness {{are similar to those of}} the low carbon steel.

In the present study, some characteristics of the decarburized layer in the <b>spheroidal</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> were investigated. The results obtained are as follows.

When the area ratios of the decarburized layer to whole sectional area in the rod-shaped tensile test specimen was defined to be a ratio of decarburized layer, the tensile strength of the specimen scarcely influenced by the ratio of decarburized layer.

Postinoculation or addition of antimony was achieved by fixing appropriate amounts of materials in the gating system of each block. Cooling curves recorded in the center of the blocks show that solidification proceeds in three steps: a short primary deposition of graphite followed by an initial and then a bulk eutectic reaction. Formation of CHG could be unambiguously associated with increased recalescence during the bulk eutectic reaction.

40|$|The <b>spheroidal</b> <b>graphite</b> (SG) <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> fractomechanical {{response}} {{varies with}} the test temperature and with the microstructure parameters. In the present paper, we analyze this variation performing fractomechanical tests in a temperature range from - 40 °C to + 20 °C, doing also Charpy and tensile tests for material characterization. The tests were carried out on as-cast samples and heat treated samples to obtain an ADI grade 1. In both cases, we studied samples taken from two well differentiated "Y" block sizes. The results obtained show that, for the chemical composition analyzed, both castings have a fractomechanical response decrease as the temperature diminishes. Besides, the block size enlargement produce a deterioration of the mechanical properties (the fracture toughness, mainly), for both castings...|$|R
