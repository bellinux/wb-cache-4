40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1999 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaL- 3 Communications Telemetry & Instrumentation (L- 3 T&I) has {{developed}} an advanced IBM PC-AT Telemetry, Tracking, and Commanding (TT&C) SATCOM system based on the utilization of Field Programmable Gate Array / Digital Signal Processing (FPGA/DSP) microprocessors. This system includes up-link, down-link, and range processing sections. Physically, the system consists of one IF Transceiver and two or more FPGA/DSP microprocessor boards called Advanced Processing Microprocessors (APMs). The form factor of these PWBs is compliant with full length, full height IBM PC PCI bus cards. This paper describes the features and functionality of an advanced Telemetry, Tracking, and Commanding Processing System (TT&CPS) based on the implementation of FPGA and DSP microprocessors. The high-level functional attributes of the TT&CPS are depicted in Figure 1. There are four main functional blocks: the IF Transceiver, the Down-Link Processing Section, the Up-Link Processing Section, and the Range Processor. The analog/IF circuitry in the IF Transceiver card interfaces between the 68 – 72 MHz (70 MHz, nominal) IF I/O signals and the Up-Link and Down-Link Processing Section's DSP equipment. The down-link portion of the IF Transceiver card has two user-selected input ports. From the selected input, the signal is processed through selectable bandwidth limiting, gain control, Doppler correction (optional), quadrature down-conversion to zero hertz (baseband), selectable baseband filtering, and precision Analog-to-Digital (A/D) conversion. The up-link portion of the IF Transceiver card takes I/Q digital data from the APM performing the up-link processing functions. This baseband I/Q digital data is Digital-to-Analog (D/A) converted, filtered, quadrature up-converted to 68 – 72 MHz, up-link Doppler corrected (optional), output level detected and level controlled, and sent to a two-position output selector switch. The down-link portion of the TT&CPS provides main carrier linear PM or BPSK or QPSK demodulation and can also, in composite linear PM demodulation mode, receive and demodulate FSK and/or BPSK subcarriers and ranging signals. The demodulators use symbol timing loops and bit decision circuits (matched filters) to perform the bit synchronization function. Several decoding algorithms, including differential, de-interleaving, Viterbi, and Reed-Solomon, are available for the down-link telemetry. Command format checking and CRC status is also available on FSK-demodulated data. Direct carrier BPSK/QPSK demodulation has decoding and frame synchronization capabilities. Because of the modular construction of the firmware {{and the use of}} FPGAs and DSPs, the system can be loaded with only the functions in use, lowering initial setup time while increasing overall system capability. To support a particular function, the card is downloaded with an “image,” which programs the FPGAs and DSPs at initialization. The user can change configurations by simply downloading a new set of instructions to the FPGA/DSP on the fly to keep the ground station running with minimal downtime. The flexibility of the design minimizes <b>spare</b> <b>board</b> costs, while achieving greater programmability at the end-user location...|$|E

5000|$|The {{term has}} its {{origin in the}} old American {{expression}} [...] "to spin a yarn". In the 18th and 19th century, sailors were known for using their <b>spare</b> time on <b>board</b> ship to make thread or string (yarn). Sailors were also well known for telling incredible tales about their exploits when they were back on shore. When someone fooled you, {{it was said that}} [...] "he spun me an amazing yarn".

40|$|A new {{stripline}} beam {{position monitoring}} (BPM) readout and processing system was installed and successfully tested over a two-week period at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF 2), at KEK, Japan during February 2010. The core analog processing board {{used in the}} system is a duplicate of that developed for, and in use at, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC. The digitization, processing and control front-end were custom designed for ATF 2 using a 14 -bit 100 -MHz VME digitizer and an EPICS Input / Output Controller (IOC) running on the VME controller. Control of the analog boards is via EPICS, which controls a serial-over-TCP / IP port server. Hardware for the readout of up to 14 BPMs with 3 <b>spare</b> analog <b>boards</b> was delivered. The goal of this installation was to provide better than 10 microns resolution, non-charge-dependent readout of the ATF 2 electron beam with long-term gain stability compensation. These criteria were tested and successfully met. This design {{was found to be}} highly effective and to have many advantages, especially that it required minimal installation effort at ATF 2...|$|R
60|$|The carpenter's gang {{continued}} steadily {{at their}} work, {{while the first}} officer got up the sheer-legs and hoisted the stump of the mainmast from its place. The butt of the new mainmast was cut to match this, and {{on the second day}} after it arrived alongside it was hoisted into its position. The whole of the stays and rigging of the mainmast had been cut away as soon as it went overboard; but there was plenty of <b>spare</b> rope on <b>board,</b> and before evening the new mast was firmly stayed in its place, and all was in readiness for hoisting the spar that was to serve as topmast.|$|R
60|$|When {{he went on}} deck in {{the morning}} the breeze was fresh and Columbine drove through the water under all plain sail, for they had some <b>spare</b> canvas on <b>board.</b> The sky was clear and the sun sparkled on the foam that leaped about the bows and ran astern in a broad white wake. The old boat was fast and there was {{something}} exhilarating in her buoyant lift and roll. Marston and Wyndham got breakfast under an awning on deck. Wyndham wore thin white clothes and a silk belt. His skin was burned a dark red and his keen blue eyes sparkled. One saw the graceful lines of his muscular figure; he looked alert and virile.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the rest}} of the area is {{residential}}. Some villages in this portion of Diliman are Teachers Village, U.P. Village, and Sikatuna Village. Those closer to the University of the Philippines campus such as Teachers Village and U.P. Village remain mostly residential although there are two major secondary schools in the area namely Claret School of Quezon City and Holy Family School of Quezon City, and many have converted <b>spare</b> rooms into <b>boarding</b> facilities for out-of-town students attending schools in the area: U.P., Ateneo, and Miriam College. The eastern edge of the Diliman area is roughly bound by Katipunan Avenue which passes in front of Ateneo and Miriam and runs behind the U.P. Diliman campus.|$|R
6000|$|The only craft I {{could get}} on board of, to come round into my own latitude, in order to enjoy myself in the old way, was an eastern schooner, called the James. On board this vessel I shipped as mate, bound to Philadelphia. She was the most meagre craft, {{in the way of}} outfit, I ever put to sea in. Her boat would not swim, and she had not a <b>spare</b> spar on <b>board</b> her. In this style, we went jogging along north, until we were met by a north-west gale, between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras, which forced us to heave-to. During this gale, I had a proof of the truth that [...] "where the {{treasure}} is, there will the heart be also." ...|$|R
60|$|The Ocean Queen {{had indeed}} sprung a leak, and so bad {{was it that}} when all the pumps {{available}} were set a-going, they failed to reduce the depth {{of water in the}} hold. Still, by constantly changing hands and making strenuous exertions, they prevented it from increasing rapidly. All that night and next day they wrought with unflagging energy at the pumps. No man on <b>board</b> <b>spared</b> himself. The captain took his spell with the rest. Even Mr Webster threw off his coat and went to work {{as if he had been}} born and bred a coal-heaver. The work, however, was very exhausting, and when land appeared no one seemed to have any heart to welcome it except Annie and her old nurse Mrs Niven.|$|R
60|$|The {{officers}} bowed; {{they were}} too much depressed to reply. Their mortification was great at being overpowered by a vessel so much inferior in strength to their own, and the feeling was increased now by seeing that their conqueror was a lad no older than the senior of the midshipmen. Turnbull's cabin was at once allotted to the lieutenant, and a large spare cabin to the midshipmen. Leaving Lippincott in charge, with ten men, Nat went with Turnbull and the doctor on board the frigate, and the boat went back to fetch {{the rest of the}} crew. The merchantmen had been signalled to send as many men as they could <b>spare</b> on <b>board</b> the frigate, and not until these arrived did Nat feel comfortable. Of his own crew three had been killed and ten wounded; three of these were fit for duty, and formed part of Lippincott's party, and the twenty he had with him seemed lost on board the frigate. Although Turnbull had had hawsers coiled over the hatches, the thought that there were nearly a hundred prisoners there, and that there were enough comparatively slightly wounded to overpower the two men placed as sentries over each hatchway, was a very unpleasant one. The arrival, however, of thirty of the merchant sailors, armed to the teeth, altered the position of affairs.|$|R
5000|$|For the 2001 summer season, Galaxy was {{replaced}} by the brand-new [...] in the Alaskan service. As a result, Galaxy was relocated into European waters, cruising the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. On 2 June 2001, while departing Amsterdam in the Netherlands for a two-week cruise the Galaxy touched bottom on an outskirt of Forteiland at IJmuiden due to heavy northwesterly squalls, resulting in major damage to the port side propeller. The ship returned to the Port of Amsterdam for inspection and disembarkation of the passengers. The cruise had to be cancelled as the Galaxy went into drydock at Blohm + Voss in Hamburg, Germany. There it was discovered that all four blades of the port side propeller would have to be replaced; however the ship only carried two <b>spare</b> blades on <b>board.</b> To solve the problem two extra propeller blades carried on board Galaxys sister ship MV Mercury were flown from the Caribbean to Hamburg and installed on the Galaxy. Following repairs the ship re-entered service on 16 June 2001.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ship was}} sold to States Marine Lines, Inc. and renamed the SS Badger State. [...] She was hired under {{contract}} with the Military Sea Transportation Service in 1969, she sailed from Naval Weapons Station Bangor around December 12, 1969 with a full load of 8,900 bombs, rockets, shells and mines bound for Da Nang, South Vietnam. As the ship made {{its way across the}} North Pacific she came into heavy weather roughly 550 miles North of Midway Island on the 17th and began to roll heavily in the growing waves and howling winds. As the ship rolled from side to side, the securing bands on her dangerous cargo began to give way threatening to let the bombs come loose onboard, meaning almost certain destruction for ship and her crew. Racing to re-secure the cargo {{in the midst of a}} major storm, the crew of the Badger State used everything they could to shore up the dangerous load of bombs; ships mattresses, hatch <b>boards,</b> <b>spare</b> lifejackets, chairs, linen, stores, mooring lines and even frozen meat to keep the bombs from coming loose.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{model of}} a {{two-seater}} roadster style car, possibly based on the look and style of a Mercer Raceabout from the early 20th century. The model first appeared in late 1976 and was designed by Steve Malins with input from George Morris. The first versions were finished in red and white with black upholstery (still available), newer versions have recently appeared in green/brass or burgundy/brass finishes. A silver 4-seater limousine based on the Roadster is also a popular model appearing in the 1980s. The boiler cover forms the 'bonnet' of the car with the sight-glass for checking the water level being the 'radiator grille'. Early versions sported the traditional overflow plug, which was replaced by the sight glass in 1978 to conform with the new Euro Toy Regulations. The earliest Roadsters were meths fired, appearing in late 1976. From about 1977 all models used a steel pan type solid fuel burner, although the older steel pan meths burners still fitted. The oscillating-cylinder engine is mounted externally on the left-hand side of the model and incorporates a simple forward and reverse lever like that used on the SE2a and MEC1 stationary engines. The unit drives a small solid flywheel mounted externally on the right-hand side via a shaft. Again a distinguishing feature of early models is the 'split-drive' with final drive on the left hand side as opposed to later (and current) models were the drive is all on the right. This shaft drives the rear axle by a power band. This arrangement allows a slightly higher road speed than the SW1 wagon but much slower than the TE1 traction engine (which was ridiculously too fast). This chassis and layout is used on other mobiles in the Mamod ranges such as the LB1 London bus, FE1 fire engine, SA1L limousine as well as the DV1/2 vans. The early wheels are in the style of wooden carriage wheels (as found on cars of the period - these were known as artillery wheels), with solid rubber tyres. Later models used a redesigned wheel which was based upon the design used for the Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. Details such as running <b>boards,</b> <b>spare</b> wheel and carriage lamps are also fitted.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{places in}} North America, length is {{commonly}} 48 feet or 53 feet, and width is either 96 or 102 inches (including rub rails and stake pockets on the sides, which generally placed every 2 feet). Some older trailers still in service are only 45 feet or shorter if used in sets of doubles or triples (often used to haul hay). Various lengths and combination setups {{can only be}} legally driven on turnpike/toll roads which are far too long for most roadways. Body and frame {{can be one of}} 3 general designs: the heaviest and sturdiest is all steel (usually with wood planks), Ever popular combo with steel frame and aluminium bed, these type often have wood portions for nailing down dunnage boards), and aluminium (which is the lightest allowing for more cargo to be legally carried without overweight permits). Incredibly light and very expensive to purchase, all aluminium trailers are very slippery when wet, flex more and are easily damaged. They also have a natural upwards bend so that when loaded they straighten out to be more flat, rather than to sag in the middle under a load. Another popular type of flatbed trailer is a stepdeck (or drop deck) with approximately 2 feet lower deck and low profile wheels to accommodate taller loads, without hitting low bridges or tunnels. These stepdecks can come with loading ramps to allow vehicles to roll on and off of the back from ground level. Shorter trailers used for local jobs such as landscaping and building material delivery within urban or local areas can have a [...] "hitchhiker" [...] type forklift truck attached to the back in order for driver alone to deliver and unload pallet/skid items. A bulkhead or [...] "headache rack" [...] is sometimes be attached to the front of either a straight or a stepdeck trailer for load securement {{at the front of the}} deck. In the event of long pipes or steel or lumber coming loose in a hard braking incident, they save the operator and cab/sleeper in one of two manners in theory. If attached to the trailer they bend while attempting to block forward motion of a loosened cargo, causing the long load to go above the cab and driver. If attached to the frame behind the cab or sleeper of the tractor, in theory they protect the back of the cab from impact and if unable to stop the load coming thru the cab, they cause the cab to be knocked off of.the frame, rather than impale the cab and kill or seriously injure the driver.48 and 53 ft lengths usually have two axles spread out to over 10 ft apart at the rear [...] "California spread" [...] in order to allow for more weight distribution on the rear of the deck (40,000 lb instead of 34,000 for a tandem axles design). So-called Cali spread was originally designed to comply with bridge weight formulas in that state but has since been adopted in most other parts of the country. These spread axles take far wider turning radius, and if turning the combination tractor/trailer too sharply, the front axle tires of the trailer may damage the road/parking lot surface, or pop a tire bead off of the rim, or both. Some trailers have the capability of lifting or lowering the front axle independently to mitigate this risk, however driver may not be able to use this feature if the trailer is loaded, but if the deck is empty the driver can lower the front axle to bring the rear axle off of the ground to significantly decrease turning radius of the rig for easy manoeuvre in tight spaces, or to reduce tire wear during empty /deadhead miles of travel. Under the deck of the trailer can be attached racks for <b>spare</b> tires, dunnage <b>boards,</b> or tire chains...as well as various tool/storage boxes. On one side (or often both sides for alternating pull on strap tension) are usually sliding (but sometimes fixed) winches to ratchet down 4 inch straps for load securement. On most 48 foot trailers, you may not place these strap/winches over a tire as when air pressure releases out of the suspension system when parked, the deck lowers down and will likely pop a trailer tire. Some trailers have an air scale which when the driver learns how to interpret properly through experience, combined with his knowledge of how much his/her rig weighs when empty and can interpret how much cargo can safely and legally be loaded onto the trailer. With different varying loads of cargo, driver can have an idea how much his gross total weight is (and if he is legal to avoid ticket) (80,000 without a permit in most states, but slightly lower in others). Some decks have pop up chain systems which have a higher WLL (working load limit) than attaching chains to either the stake pocket/spools, or the frame. Other decks of trailers can have sliding detachable accessories which greatly diversify your options of where and how to place a chain hook for securement. Besides axles which raise/lower as needed, some spread axle trailers can slide one or both axles forward, or back to create a tandem setup in specific situations when necessary, to comply with weight distribution requirements. Although certain amounts of front and rear cargo overhang is allowed (as well as overhang to one or both sides of the trailer) with flags/banners/flashing lights to warn drivers behind and to the side of you of impending danger of impalement if they follow too close behind you and you should have to suddenly stop...in extreme cases permit loads require escort be led front rear or both for oversize/over dimension cargo/equipment.|$|R
