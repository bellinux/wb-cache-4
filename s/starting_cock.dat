50|$|The boiler was {{the largest}} of a German steam engine {{at the time the}} XX HV was brought into service and had {{exceptionally}} long heating tubes of 5.8 m in length. The grate was of almost square shape and had to be arranged above the frame due to its size. The boiler was used in the Saxon XVIII H as well, with only minor adjustments to decrease its weight which resulted in a heating area that was smaller by 10 m2. The boiler was supplied with water through two feedwater pumps that were later replaced by one injector and a Knorr feed pump with preheater. The steam engine was configured as a four-cylinder compound. The high pressure cylinders sloped steeply between the frame sides, the low pressure cylinders were located in the usual, horizontal position outside the frame. Both pairs of cylinders drove the second coupled axle. To control the supply to the low pressure cylinders there was a normal Walschaerts valve gear which also controlled the inside cylinders via pendulum levers. A special feature was the Lindner <b>starting</b> <b>cock,</b> already well-known on two-cylinder compounds, which could supply additional live steam to the low pressure cylinders when working at over 60%.|$|E
60|$|By {{that time}} it was long past noon, and the hunter was meditating the propriety of going to a {{neighbouring}} height to view the surrounding country, when a slight noise attracted his attention. He <b>started,</b> <b>cocked</b> his gun, glared round in all directions, and held his breath.|$|R
60|$|He {{had just}} reached the wood {{on the other}} side, and turned to wait for his comrade, when he heard two shots in quick succession. There was nothing unusual in this, but {{when he heard the}} Philosopher utter a loud cry, he <b>started,</b> <b>cocked</b> his gun, and ran a few steps back to meet him. Next moment Jack burst from the thicket and ran across the plain at a speed that told of {{imminent}} danger. From the same thicket there also rushed a large grizzly bear, whose speed was greater than that of Jack, though it {{did not appear to be}} so.|$|R
60|$|Next, we <b>started</b> <b>cocked</b> hat--that is to say, a {{triangle}} of three pins, {{the other seven}} being discarded. In this game we used the three smallest balls and kept on delivering them until we got the three pins down. After {{a day or two}} of practice {{we were able to get}} the chief pin with an output of four balls, but it cost us a great many deliveries to get the other two; but by and by we succeeded in perfecting our art--at least we perfected it to our limit. We reached a scientific excellence where we could get the three pins down with twelve deliveries of the three small balls, making thirty-six shots to conquer the cocked hat.|$|R
50|$|This breed {{belongs to}} the group of long-crowing chicken breeds. Their crow averages 20-40 seconds, {{exceptional}} birds will go on for 60 seconds. The <b>cock</b> <b>starts</b> to crow when six to seven months old.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the mythology's central character, Zero the Hero, {{is going}} about his {{everyday}} {{life when he}} suddenly has a vision in Charing Cross Road, London. He is compelled to seek heroes and <b>starts</b> worshiping the <b>Cock</b> Pot Pixie, {{one of a number}} of Pot Head Pixies from the Planet Gong. These pixies are green, have propellers on their heads, and fly around in teapots (inspired by Bertrand Russell's teapot).|$|R

5000|$|Capital City Sports (CCS) is SGTVâ€™s award-nominated weekly sports show. CCS {{covers all}} things Gamecock sports, {{producing}} highlights, packages, and feature stories every week. CCS began broadcasting club sports on campus in the Fall of 2015, <b>starting</b> with <b>Cock</b> Hockey and branded {{themselves as the}} Capital City Sports Network (CCSN). Since then, the CCSN has travelled to two SECHC Tournaments and has branched into other sports, such as lacrosse and baseball. The CCSN was created by John Dowdy, Nic Jones, Brian Principe, and Brett Williams. Spurs Up is the reincarnation of 1 Up 1 Down, created by Ben Parsons and De'Angelo Stevenson. Ben and De'Angelo talk college and professional sports and bring on a guest host {{to talk about their}} topic of choice.|$|R
50|$|Born in Hayle, Cornwall, <b>Cock</b> <b>started</b> his {{professional}} career with Brentford during World War I. A striker, {{he moved to}} Fulham in 1919. In three seasons with the Second Division club, he averaged a goal every other game, and was the club's leading goalscorer in 1919-20 and 1920-21. He moved to Notts County in October 1922 and played nearly 100 games in three seasons there, being the club's top scorer in 1922-23 and 1923-24, winning the Second Division title in the former.|$|R
60|$|This {{parachute}} was 34 feet in diameter, and was distended by {{a strong}} hoop to prevent its closing. There was also {{a hole in the}} middle of it, about 6 feet in diameter. Mr <b>Cocking</b> <b>started</b> from Vauxhall Gardens on the 24th of July, and after ascending to a considerable height, cut himself loose from his balloon when over Blackheath. The parachute descended rapidly, and vibrated with great violence; the large hoop broke, the machine collapsed, and the unfortunate aeronaut was killed, and his body dreadfully mutilated.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cocks</b> <b>started</b> {{his career}} in {{television}} in the late 1990s. His prominent role on television is a builder and renovator, though he has worked on other projects that {{are not related to}} building in his career. One of the earliest TV shows that he appeared on was April's Angels. He appeared on this show alongside April Ieremia in 1998. After this <b>Cocks</b> then <b>started</b> appearing on the popular New Zealand home renovation TV show My House My Castle as the building consultant and builder. This show successfully ran from 1999 until 2009.|$|R
50|$|Cock's first {{victories}} came on 6 April 1917, when he destroyed an Albatros D.III {{and drove}} another {{down out of}} control. He then used his two-seater for a string of successful combats lasting through 22 July; he flew with no fewer than seven different observers manning his guns, the most notable of whom was Victor White. On 22 July, on his 97th combat sortie, he set an Albatros D.V afire, then was himself shot down by Hauptmann Wilhelm Reinhard of Jasta 11 to <b>start</b> Reinhard's career. <b>Cock</b> was the last survivor of the 45 Squadron pilots {{who had come to}} France nine months prior. He also survived being shot down, becoming a prisoner of war. His attempt to escape was unsuccessful, and he was not repatriated until December 1918. The final tally of his victories was five Albatros D.Vs destroyed, including one shared with fellow ace William Wright and his observer Edward Caufield-Kelly, and eight driven down out of control.|$|R
