5|$|On March 4, 1969 the FSU {{chapter of}} Students for a Democratic Society, an {{unregistered}} university student organization, sought to use university facilities for meetings. The FSU administration, under President Stanley Marshall, subsequently {{decided not to}} allow the SDS the use of university property and obtained a court injunction to bar the group. The result was a protest and mass arrest at bayonet point of some 58 <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> incident later called the Night of the Bayonets. The university Faculty Senate later criticized the administration's response as provoking as an artificial crisis. Another notable event occurred when FSU students massed in protest of student deaths at Kent State University causing classes to be canceled. Approximately 1000 students marched to the ROTC building where they were confronted by police armed with shotguns and carbines. Joining the all-night vigil, Governor Claude Kirk appeared unexpectedly with a wicker chair and spent hours, with little escort or fanfare, on Landis Green discussing politics with protesting students.|$|E

500|$|In 1986, Signithia Fordham co-authored with Nigerian {{sociologist}} John Ogbu a {{study that}} concluded that high-performing African-American students in a Washington, D.C., high school borrowed from hegemonic white culture {{as part of a}} strategy for achievement, while struggling to maintain a black identity. Ogbu made a related claim in his 2003 book, Black American <b>Students</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement, concluding that black students' own cultural attitudes sometimes hindered academic achievement and that these attitudes are too often neglected. Ogbu had earlier written in his seminal work Minority Education and Caste (1978), that school disengagement among caste-like minorities occurs because white society limits the job-success of their parents and others in their communities by a glass ceiling. In his new book, he said that non-whites [...] "failed to observe the link between educational achievement and access to jobs." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the post-war}} era, BGSU {{constructed}} temporary structures {{to keep up}} with the increased housing demands for veterans and their families. BGSU added 40 trailers to house male and married students in 1945, known as [...] "Falcon Heights". In 1946, the university added 15 steel buildings to house male <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> area near the football stadium that became known as [...] "Tin Pan Alley". By the late 1940s, the student house shortage became so severe that the nearby National Guard Armory and ODOT garage were converted to house male students. The Federal Housing Authority provided two wooden barracks, ten trailers, and more steel buildings. The BGSU Army ROTC was established on campus in 1948 as enrollment increased dramatically in the post war era. The university continued to add academic programs as the enrollment increased during the mid to late 1940s, including the Graduate School in 1948 after Dr. Emerson Shuck led the effort to create school. By 1950, enrollment grew to new record highs, with over 5,000 students.|$|E
