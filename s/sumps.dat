40|$|The {{original}} <b>sump</b> {{design of}} Rolls-Royce AE 3007 central <b>sump</b> is a tangential <b>sump.</b> An experimental program at Purdue University {{was conducted to}} investigate {{the characteristics of a}} tangential <b>sump</b> design. The research employed a bespoke experimental rig consisting of modular transparent chamber to allow unprecedented view of the two-phase flow inside the bearing chamber. It was found that a persistent liquid pooling near the drain entrance of a tangential <b>sump</b> obstructs the outflow to the scavenge off-take. While space requirement is minimal, the scavenge performance of a tangential <b>sump</b> is poor. A prototype advanced <b>sump</b> was proposed and built with features to address various issues found in the tangential <b>sump.</b> In this paper, further experimental work on the refinements of the advanced <b>sump</b> is presented. This includes experimental study on the effect of a fence and splitter plate, off-take hole diameter and its location, the effect of gravity by tilting, upstream wall fairing, as well as the depth of the <b>sump</b> itself. The experiments showed that the faired upstream wall modification can reduce residence volume significantly across different operating conditions, indicating improvement in scavenge performance. The other modifications help to reduce residence volume only in certain operating conditions. The results of this study helped towards the birth of an optimized <b>sump</b> design, known as Indy <b>sump.</b> The Indy <b>sump</b> has been accepted as a superior <b>sump</b> design and {{has been used as a}} benchmark in many <b>sump</b> design studies...|$|R

During this time the University of California took over the blufftop Marine camp, {{turning it into a}} modern university. The burst of growth brought traffic, housing, and water problems, which led to improvements in the transportation system, such as the building of Highway 101 through town; tracts of low-cost housing, especially on the Mesa, where oil derricks were removed and replaced by houses; and the building of Lake Cachuma reservoir {{on the other side of}} the mountains, along with another water tunnel to bring its water to thirsty residents. During this period, the city selectively recruited businesses to relocate there, choosing clean industries such as aerospace and technology in preference to the oil industry which had already marred many local landscapes with abandoned wells and <b>sumps.</b>|$|E

50|$|Alternative <b>sump</b> pump {{systems can}} be driven by {{municipal}} water pressure.

When water rises higher than normal for any reason, the backup float in the <b>sump</b> is lifted and activates the backup <b>sump</b> pump. As municipal water rushes through the ejector, it creates a powerful suction force which causes the PVC pipe {{to act like a}} giant soda straw, drawing water up from the <b>sump</b> and ejecting it outdoors.

2500|$|The 18th-century mine {{workings}} began from adits {{driven into the}} sloping hillside {{along the line of}} the vein. These were known as the Top Level, Middle Level and Gilgower's Level. As each level was extended further into the hill, ore was obtained by cutting rises above the levels, or <b>sumps</b> below them. The ore was usually removed by overhead stoping (called [...] "roofing" [...] locally), that is, by cutting away the roof of a level. Wooden working platforms were built above the level, supported on heavy beams wedged between {{the two sides of the}} vein. The ore was dropped down from the stopes to the level below, filled into wooden wheelbarrows and wheeled out. In places the workings could be as much as [...] wide where the vein had split into two distinct branches, or fissures to the east had been mineralised. These workings were left open with no support and the large holes on the hillside today show where they eventually collapsed.|$|E
2500|$|Mining work at Greenside (that is, driving levels, <b>sumps</b> and rises, {{and winning}} ore from the stopes) was {{done during the}} nineteenth century by groups of miners who formed {{partnerships}} and worked as independent contractors.

Interim payments of £2 per man (called [...] "lent money") were made at the end of the first and second months. These were then deducted, along with the costs of candles, gunpowder and the sharpening of tools, from the payment at the end of the quarter. On average each miner earned 16 to 18 shillings per week under this system. Until 1837 the quarterly payments were made at the Angel Inn in Penrith.
