5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat {{was unknown}} to {{the world at large}} prior to 1974. Its common name refers to its discoverer, Thai {{zoologist}} Kitti Thonglongya. Thonglongya worked with a British partner, John E. Hill, in classifying bats of Thailand; after Thonglongya died <b>suddenly</b> <b>in</b> February 1974, Hill formally described the species, giving it the binomial name Craseonycteris thonglongyai in honour of his colleague.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan were <b>suddenly</b> <b>in</b> demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several {{theatrical}} managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Stewart wrote {{a history}} of the New Zealand Division, which was {{published}} in 1921 and would be the main reference work for this formation for several decades. He resumed his teaching career at Canterbury College but in 1926 returned to England, as a Professor of Latin at the University of Leeds. In 1929, he became the principal of University College of Nottingham. He died <b>suddenly</b> <b>in</b> 1934 while in transit to England after a holiday in New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Blaine {{had always}} {{believed}} his health to be fragile, {{and by the}} time he joined Harrison’s cabinet he truly was unwell. The years at the State Department also brought Blaine personal tragedy as two of his children, Walker and Alice, died <b>suddenly</b> <b>in</b> 1890. Another son, Emmons, died in 1892. With these family issues and his declining health, Blaine decided to retire and announced that he would resign from the cabinet on June 4, 1892. Because of their growing animosity, and because Blaine’s resignation came three days before the 1892 Republican National Convention began, Harrison suspected that Blaine was preparing to run against him for the party’s nomination for president.|$|E
5|$|By 1929, the {{phenomenon}} of beta decay prompted Bohr to again suggest that the law of conservation of energy be abandoned, but Enrico Fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr {{to create a new}} theory of the compound nucleus in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus. In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died <b>suddenly</b> <b>in</b> 1938.|$|E
5|$|By 926 Sihtric {{had evidently}} {{acknowledged}} Æthelstan as over-king, adopting Christianity and marrying a sister of Æthelstan at Tamworth. Within {{the year he}} may have abandoned his new faith and repudiated his wife, but before Æthelstan and he could fight, Sihtric died <b>suddenly</b> <b>in</b> 927. His kinsman, perhaps brother, Gofraid, who had remained as his deputy in Dublin, came from Ireland to take power in York, but failed. Æthelstan moved quickly, seizing much of Northumbria. In less than a decade, {{the kingdom of the}} English had become by far the greatest power in Britain and Ireland, perhaps stretching as far north as the Firth of Forth.|$|E

5|$|In late 1998, 120–130 tammar {{wallabies}} died <b>suddenly</b> <b>in</b> {{research facilities}} and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms, with most exhibiting no symptoms at all. Post mortem examination revealed haemorrhage of muscle, and abdominal and thoracic organs. The syndrome {{is known as}} tammar sudden death syndrome and the pathogen is an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae. It does not occur south of Sydney. Captive populations of tammar wallabies in New South Wales have subsequently suffered infections in summer months. No treatment has been attempted due to the rapid progression of the disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, {{unmarried}} sisters Catherine and Margaret Flannagan ran a rooming house at 5 Skirving Street, Liverpool. The household {{in the final}} months of 1880 consisted of the two sisters, Catherine's son John, and two lodger families – hod carrier Thomas Higgins and his daughter Mary, and Patrick Jennings and his daughter Margaret. John Flannagan, 22 and previously healthy, died <b>suddenly</b> <b>in</b> December 1880. His death did not raise any particular comment; Catherine collected £71 (worth roughly £ in 2012 pounds) from the burial society with {{which he had been}} registered and he was interred shortly thereafter.|$|E
