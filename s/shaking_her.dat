5|$|The Scranton and Stamford {{branches}} {{prepare for}} the upcoming merger. Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) professes excitement over the merger, mostly because of the return of Jim Halpert (John Krasinski). She soon learns throughout the day that Jim has become slightly distant at her {{and that he has}} formed a close relationship with Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones), visibly <b>shaking</b> <b>her.</b> Feeling bad with their awkward reunion, Jim catches up to Pam {{at the end of the}} day and informs her that he's seeing someone.

5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E

500|$|The {{video is}} similar in {{thematic}} content to Mötley Crüe's video for the single [...] "Girls, Girls, Girls". But in contrast, this video tells the story from Madonna's point of view. [...] She looks down into the cubicles {{to make eye contact}} with the men but they are unable to return it. She also looks assertively into the camera, making eye contact with the viewer. With these scenes Madonna portrays her holding power over the men and the ability to pursue them. Madonna represents an assertive woman searching for a lover who can accept her as a human being. Author Bruce Forbes notes that the men in the cubicles are proved unworthy of her and there is an undertone of mockery when Madonna addresses them as 'baby' while <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> body.|$|E
500|$|Caught up in {{the wave}} {{of rock and roll}} {{sweeping}} across Italy in 1958, Mina listened to American records and was a frequent visitor at the , the Santa Tecla, and the Taverna Messicana clubs of Milan, which promoted rock and roll music. Mina's repertoire at the beginning of her career included clumsy imitations of British and American rock and jazz songs, while her extra-loud and syncopated version of the song [...] "Nessuno" [...] showcased her excellent sense of rhythm. Earlier in 1958, Domenico Modugno had caused astonishment by raising his hands in the air during his performance of Nel blu dipinto di blu ("Volare"). In Mina's first TV appearances she further broke with tradition by <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> head, hands, and hips to the rhythm.

500|$|Meanwhile, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) {{have decided}} to avoid the expense and stress of a wedding and elope to a simple {{courthouse}} ceremony in Youngstown, Ohio without letting their co-workers know. Pam comes {{to work with a}} wedding dress and Jim picks up flowers in the office parking lot. As they are leaving, they decide to stop in at Cafe Disco, and end up having a lot of fun, making them decide they really want an actual wedding ceremony after all. Phyllis eventually recovers and dances with Bob in the Cafe Disco. Michael tries to encourage Angela (Angela Kinsey) to dance, but she refuses because she does not like [...] "the general spirit of music." [...] When Angela starts softly <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> foot to the beat, however, Michael is extremely satisfied with the small victory.

500|$|The concert {{began with}} the lights dimming and a sole {{spotlight}} being focused on the crowd. The spotlight then followed Shakira {{as she entered the}} hall wearing a hooded fuchsia gown. Singing the [...] "pensive" [...] and [...] "sentimental" [...] ballad [...] "Pienso En Tí" [...] ("I Think of You"), she began walking towards the stage while <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> fans' hands and hugging them. As soon as Shakira climbed the stage, she threw off the gown to reveal her main attire: a mesh gold crop top coupled with skin-tight leather pants. A more energetic routine followed as she [...] "sprinted, jumped, and yodelled" [...] across the stage while performing more guitar-oriented versions of [...] "Why Wait" [...] and [...] "Te Dejo Madrid" [...] ("I Leave You Madrid"). After stopping to play a harmonica solo, Shakira performed [...] "Si Te Vas" [...] ("If You Go") accompanied by [...] "dense" [...] musical instrumentation. This was followed by a more rock-tinged performance of [...] "Whenever, Wherever", during which Shakira invited four female fans onto the stage and taught them how to belly dance.|$|E
500|$|The stage show {{included}} new choreography, {{as well as}} Victoria Halkiti and Nektarios Georgiadis as backing vocalists. Kalomoira {{started off}} the show sitting on a diamond sequenced bench held up by her dancers. She then got down and started a dance routine with complex choreography. There was also a large purple book on stage that opened up as a heart shaped pop-up book that Kalomoira stepped out of when she sang the lyrics [...] "an open book". In time with the book opening, Kalomoira removed her pink dress revealing a pink and silver mini-dress underneath. Toward {{the middle of the}} song during the break, the cameras cut to Kalomoira who was doing a provocative dance; <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> whole body. At the end of the song, she was slightly lifted up by her dancers. The background image on stage was a skyline of buildings that moved with glowing lights. She wore clothes exclusively by JLO and managed to finish in first place out of nineteen countries, receiving 156 points.|$|E
500|$|Mating {{occurs in}} May and June, and females lay single {{clutches}} {{of three to}} 30 eggs in June or July. According to field research, females deposit their eggs at the same nesting sites each year. The nests are built near each other as suitable nesting sites are becoming rare. On Cuba's Isla de la Juventud, Cuban iguanas nest in pockets of earth exposed to the sun by Cuban crocodiles, after the crocodiles' eggs have hatched. [...] These nests are separate from where adult iguanas live. In areas without crocodiles, the iguanas excavate nests in sandy beaches. At the San Diego Zoo, a female built a nest {{at the end of}} a long chamber she excavated in the sand. She stood near it for weeks, defending it by <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> head and hissing at anyone who approached; this behavior demonstrated that Cuban iguanas guard their nest sites. The hatchlings spend several days to two weeks in the nest chamber from the time they hatch to the time they emerge from the nests; dispersing individually after emergence.|$|E

500|$|Milian {{described}} {{the sound of}} the album as [...] "hip hop under-toned with nice, pop melodies", and later said the genre of the album was [...] "bubble-gum pop". She described lead single [...] "AM to PM" [...] as a [...] "very pop" [...] and [...] "fun, party/club song". The genre of the album was described by one critic as [...] "light-hearted, energetic R pop tunes". Critics compared Milian to Aaliyah. Sonically, the album was said to stick [...] "rigidly to the sherbert-snorting pop formula of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera". One reviewer compared Milian to other singers of her generation, and found that [...] "while Spears has gone raunchy with 'I Love Rock 'n' Roll', Christina Aguilera down and dirty on Stripped, and even clean-cut Mandy Moore has brashly cut her hair Felicity-style, Milian still seems young and real." [...] The critic also compared Milian to Beyoncé, [...] "while Beyonce is <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> bootylicious body like crazy on 'Crazy In Love', Milian is simply enjoying becoming a young star." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} Beyoncé's {{performance at}} the Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, on August 5, 2007, Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Beyoncé needs no distractions from her singing, which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion, strutting in costumes." [...] Shaheem Reid of MTV News compared the performance with Michael Buffer further adding that [...] "Beyoncé acknowledged Shakira by <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> hips rapidly". While reviewing Beyoncé's performance of the song in Saskatoon on September 14, 2007, a writer of The StarPhoenix noted {{that it was one}} of the musical surprises during the evening. Jim Harrington from the San Jose Mercury News noted that Beyoncé's all-female band provided [...] "plenty of punch" [...] to the live performance of the song in Fresno on August 28, 2007 further noting that the singer looked like a [...] "sex kitten purring through" [...] the song. In Los Angeles, on September 2, Beyoncé performed [...] "Beautiful Liar", dressed in a green belly dancing outfit, with several female backup dancers, and live instrumentation. [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] was included on Beyoncé's live album The Beyoncé Experience Live (2007).|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of Quagmire's wedding, Lois' breasts have gotten very large after {{deciding}} to wean Stewie, {{on the advice of}} Brian. While at the reception, the top of her shirt rips open. Peter notices that Quagmire is staring at Lois' huge breasts, and deliberately spills champagne on them. Peter then [...] "helps" [...] Lois by <b>shaking</b> <b>her,</b> which makes her large breasts jiggle. This arouses Quagmire, and he realizes that he has made a mistake by marrying Joan. He informs Joan that some of his friends think they should get an annulment after discussing it with Peter, Joe and Cleveland, but she threatens to cut herself and him if he annuls their marriage. As a result, Peter decides to help Quagmire fake his death. He shows Joan a video of Quagmire being attacked by a ninja (Joe), a Nazi (Cleveland), a [...] "pots and pans" [...] robot (Peter), and the body being consumed by a dinosaur held by Peter (to the theme of Jurassic Park). Joan is unconvinced by the video. Peter and his friends then operate plan B, which consists of Quagmire pretending to suffer a heart attack and die. Quagmire is buried in a coffin with enough oxygen to last him {{a short period of time}} so Peter can return after the funeral has finished and dig him up. However, when Mayor West announces that all coffins must be buried in concrete (to guard against zombies), Peter exclaims that Quagmire is not dead, and brings him out of the coffin, alive. Death shows up to retrieve his body. Joan pleads for Quagmire's life, and touches Death's arm, which kills her instantly. Death takes Joan instead, as [...] "she was suicidal and her last name was Quagmire." [...] However, before he leaves, Quagmire asks Death to leave the body for another five minutes, thus turning him back into his old usual self.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, {{the music}} video for [...] "Ego" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics who noted similarities {{with the one}} for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". A writer of Rap-Up magazine described the video as [...] "Single Ladies (Part 2)". Tracey Ford of AOL described the video as [...] "an ode to multiple personalities, leotards and all things 'diva.'" [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented that the video would divide critics' opinions whether it is [...] "a sexy, burlesque-inspired variation on the theme [...] established {{in the other two}} videos from the Sasha Fierce side of the album, or just a 'Single Ladies' retread with more crotch and rump". Leah Greenblatt of the magazine Entertainment Weekly gave a negative review for the video, saying that it was very similar to the one for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] noting [...] " [...] 'Ego' feels an awful like the (admittedly awesome) 'Single Ladies' with a spiral perm." [...] Tamar Anitai of MTV was also negative towards the video for the song, writing that it looks like a dress rehearsal of the video for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] but [...] "in drag". She further wrote, [...] "Anyway, while the '80s horns-and-organ vibe delivers some throwback flavor, I'm not feeling the circa-2002-Christina-Aguilera curly wig or the satin prom gloves. And the boob grabbing is a little too gratuitous. And when Beyonce says 'It's too big, it's too wide, it's too strong, it won't fit, it's too much,' I'm not even positive that she's really referring to an ego." [...] Nadia Mendoza of The Sun noted that Beyoncé's appeal is [...] "fast disppearing the more she morphs into alter ego Sasha Fierce" [...] further describing the dance moves in the video as [...] "bizarre". She finished her review by writing, [...] " [...] warbles along to her track while <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> booty in a not very flattering leotard in a similar vein to the iconic Single Ladies vid. But unfortunately for her, Ego is not half as catchy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Interpreting {{the words}} of [...] "The Lord came from Sinai," [...] the Sifre taught that when God came to give the Torah to Israel, God came not from just one {{direction}}, but from all four directions. The Sifre read in [...] a list of three directions, when it says, [...] "The Lord came from Sinai, and rose from Seir to them; He shined forth from Mount Paran, and He came from Ribeboth-kodesh." [...] And the Sifre found the fourth direction in [...] which says, [...] "God comes from the south." [...] Thus, the Sifre expanded on the metaphor of God as an eagle in [...] teaching that just as a mother eagle enters her nest only after <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> chicks with her wings, fluttering {{from tree to tree}} to wake them up, so that they will have the strength to receive her, so when God revealed God's self to give the Torah to Israel, God did not appear from just a single direction, but from all four directions, as [...] says, [...] "The Lord came from Sinai, and rose from Seir to them," [...] and [...] says, [...] "God comes from the south." ...|$|E
