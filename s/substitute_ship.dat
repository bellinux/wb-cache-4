40|$|Submarine Shock Tests {{and surface}} ship Shock Trials are vital {{components}} of ship test and evaluation (T&E), and of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) requirements. Ship Shock Tests/Trials, surrogate and component tests, the Total Ship Survivability Trial (TSST), and associated analyses and simulations are {{key components of}} any alterna-tive to full-up, system-level testing using munitions likely to be encountered in combat. Ship Shock Tests/Trials, al-though conducted under conditions more benign than realistic threat conditions, provide insight into platform vulner-abilities with respect to underwater proximity bursts, and produce significant decision-making data for corrective ac-tions. The cost of conducting a ship Shock Test/Trial and the tremendous advances in simulation capabilities are driving the question: “Can simulations be <b>substituted</b> for <b>ship</b> Shock Tests/Trials? ” Unfortunately, current simulation capa-bilities still seem insufficient to provide decision-making data of equal utility to ship Shock Tests/Trials. Simulations hold the potential, however, to provide complementary decision-making data of greater value than ship Shock Tests/Trials alone. Simulation capabilities must therefore continue to be advanced. This paper contrasts the relative, overall utilities of ship Shock Tests/Trials and simulations. A list of advantages for both tests and simulations is presented, with strong {{arguments in favor of}} a combination of both approaches...|$|R

50|$|The {{region of}} Tripolitania, which {{included}} Misurata, {{came under the}} regency of the Ottoman Empire in 1551. By {{the beginning of the}} 19th century, Misrata had been established as a major center for the Trans-Saharan trade route, where caravans carrying gold, leather, and slaves, regularly stopped. Because of the rainfall along the coast, which was abundant compared to other cities in Tripolitania, and supplemental water from underground springs, Misrata's inhabitants were able to engage in unusually fertile agriculture in this largely arid region. The city was filled with thick areas of vegetable gardens while the surrounding countryside included fields of wheat, barley, date palms and olive orchards. Misrata's artisans also expanded on the city's ancient carpet industry for which it was regionally renowned. Although Misurata contained a well-built harbor, most of its long-distance trade was overland because the city of Benghazi to the east served as the preferable <b>substitute</b> for maritime <b>shipping.</b>|$|R
50|$|At this point, Zaphod {{leaves the}} task of getting to Magrathea to the ship's {{computer}} Eddie, and he, Ford, and Trillian depart to the ship's sauna. Arthur finds Eddie incapable of getting to Magrathea without help. Arthur initially tries to help by supplying the Infinite Improbability Drive with a tea <b>substitute</b> from the <b>ship's</b> Nutrimatic device {{to serve as a}} source of Brownian motion, but this only causes Arthur to temporarily take on the consciousness of Ford, Zaphod, and Trillian in their respective pasts, and must manipulate events such that items in these past periods are brought aboard the Heart of Gold in the present. Through this, Arthur gains enough parts as to replace the circuit board in the Nutrimatic so that it can produce real tea. This tea is powerful enough to power the Drive to get them to Magrathea, but in orbit, the ship is attacked by two missiles from the surface. Arthur employs the Drive again that changes the missiles into a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias, neutralizing the threat.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with obtaining the opinions of Canadian mariners as to the appropriate training which may be offered {{through the use of}} the new ship handling simulator facility established in St. John's Newfoundland, In 1987 funding was approved through the Canada- Newfoundland Offshore Development agreement for an advanced ship handling simulator facility to train Canadian mariners and to enhance safety at sea. [...] A questionnaire was distributed to Canadian mariners seeking their opinions as to the training needs. One hundred and twenty-seven questionnaires were distributed to mariners by the researcher and forty-two questionnaires were delivered to marine colleges, Canadian Coast Guard centres and shipping companies for further unrestricted distribution, two hundred and one questionnaires were returned. The study identified five sectors of the marine industry as distinct and asked respondents to associate with one of these sectors which were Great Lake shipping, Fishing, Oil exploration, Coastal shipping (ferries etc.) and General shipping (including Coast Guard). The questionnaire was limited to those mariners who had attended a radar simulator course, this was achieved by restricting the distribution to those with a minimum certification level. [...] The questionnaire addressed training needs established through informal discussions with Canadian mariners in addition to the review of training being offered, {{at the time of the}} survey, at ship handling simulator facilities in other countries. The sections on the questionnaire were ship handling, navigation, emergencies, bridge team work, offshore petroleum, fishing, navigation in ice and specialized tasks. In addition, respondents were offered the opportunity to submit related comments. [...] Respondents were asked to complete all sections of the questionnaire making the assumption that the required technology of the ship handling simulator would facilitate such training. From the analysis of the data the high number of undecided responses indicated either a lack of knowledge in the specific sections of the questionnaire such as fishing and ice navigation or a limited concept of ship handling simulation. The majority of questions received support as being appropriate training for Canadian mariners. Those questions which indicated some doubt were further analyzed by the sector represented, role within the industry and familiarity with ship handling simulators. Of the total respondents to the questionnaire over fifty percent had attended a course or visited a ship handling simulator facility. [...] The specific content for training programs has been clearly established, in addition Canadian mariners indicated that such training should be made available to all sectors of the industry and that training on a ship handling simulator must be complementary too and not a <b>substitute</b> for <b>ship</b> board experience...|$|R

Although in the act of revolt the [...] negroes made themselves masters of the hatchway, six or seven [...] wounded went through it to the cockpit, without any hindrance on [...] their part; that during the act of revolt, the mate and another [...] person, whose name he does not recollect, attempted to come up [...] through the hatchway, but being quickly wounded, were obliged to [...] return to the cabin; that the deponent resolved at break of day to [...] come up the companion-way, where the negro Babo was, being the [...] ringleader, and Atufal, who assisted him, and having spoken to [...] them, exhorted them to cease committing such atrocities, asking [...] them, at the same time, what they wanted and intended to do, [...] offering, himself, to obey their commands; that notwithstanding [...] this, they threw, in his presence, three men, alive and tied, [...] overboard; that they told the deponent to come up, and that they [...] would not kill him; which having done, the negro Babo asked him [...] whether there were in those seas any negro countries where they [...] might be carried, and he answered them, No; that the negro Babo [...] afterwards told him to carry them to Senegal, or to the [...] neighboring islands of St. Nicholas; and he answered, that this [...] was impossible, on account of the great distance, the necessity [...] involved of rounding Cape Horn, the bad condition of the vessel, [...] the want of provisions, sails, and water; but that the negro Babo [...] replied to him he must carry them in any way; that they would do [...] and conform themselves to everything the deponent should require [...] as to eating and drinking; that after a long conference, being [...] absolutely compelled to please them, for they threatened to kill [...] all the whites if they were not, at all events, carried to [...] Senegal, he told them that what was most wanting for the voyage [...] was water; that they would go near the coast to take it, and [...] thence they would proceed on their course; that the negro Babo [...] agreed to it; and the deponent steered towards the intermediate [...] ports, hoping to meet some Spanish, or foreign vessel that would [...] save them; that within ten or eleven days they saw the land, and [...] continued their course by it in the vicinity of Nasca; that the [...] deponent observed that the negroes were now restless and mutinous, [...] because he did not effect the taking in of water, the negro Babo [...] having required, with threats, that it should be done, without [...] fail, the following day; he told him he saw plainly that the coast [...] was steep, and the rivers designated in the maps were not to be [...] found, with other reasons suitable to the circumstances; that the [...] best way would be to go to the island of Santa Maria, where they [...] might water easily, it being a solitary island, as the foreigners [...] did; that the deponent did not go to Pisco, that was near, nor [...] make any other port of the coast, because the negro Babo had [...] intimated to him several times, that he would kill all the whites [...] the very moment he should perceive any city, town, or settlement [...] of any kind on the shores to which they should be carried: that [...] having determined to go to the island of Santa Maria, as the [...] deponent had planned, for the purpose of trying whether, on the [...] passage or near the island itself, they could find any vessel that [...] should favor them, or whether he could escape from it in a boat to [...] the neighboring coast of Arruco, to adopt the necessary means he [...] immediately changed his course, steering for the island; that the [...] negroes Babo and Atufal held daily conferences, in which they [...] discussed what was necessary for their design of returning to [...] Senegal, whether they were to kill all the Spaniards, and [...] particularly the deponent; that eight days after parting from the [...] coast of Nasca, the deponent being on the watch a little after [...] day-break, and soon after the negroes had their meeting, the negro [...] Babo came to the place where the deponent was, and told him that [...] he had determined to kill his master, Don Alexandro Aranda, both [...] because he and his companions could not otherwise be sure of their [...] liberty, and that to keep the seamen in subjection, he wanted to [...] prepare a warning of what road they should be made to take did [...] they or any of them oppose him; and that, by means of the death of [...] Don Alexandro, that warning would best be given; but, that what [...] this last meant, the deponent did not at the time comprehend, nor [...] could not, further than that the death of Don Alexandro was [...] intended; and moreover the negro Babo proposed to the deponent to [...] call the mate Raneds, who was sleeping in the cabin, before the [...] thing was done, for fear, as the deponent understood it, that the [...] mate, who was a good navigator, should be killed with Don [...] Alexandro and the rest; that the deponent, who was the friend, [...] from youth, of Don Alexandro, prayed and conjured, but all was [...] useless; for the negro Babo answered him that the thing could not [...] be prevented, and that all the Spaniards risked their death if [...] they should attempt to frustrate his will in this matter, or any [...] other; that, in this conflict, the deponent called the mate, [...] Raneds, who was forced to go apart, and immediately the negro Babo [...] commanded the Ashantee Martinqui and the Ashantee Lecbe to go and [...] commit the murder; that those two went down with hatchets to the [...] berth of Don Alexandro; that, yet half alive and mangled, they [...] dragged him on deck; {{that they were going to}} throw him overboard [...] in that state, but the negro Babo stopped them, bidding the murder [...] be completed on the deck before him, which was done, when, by his [...] orders, the body was carried below, forward; that nothing more was [...] seen of it by the deponent for three days; * * * that Don Alonzo [...] Sidonia, an old man, long resident at Valparaiso, and lately [...] appointed to a civil office in Peru, whither he had taken passage, [...] was at the time sleeping in the berth opposite Don Alexandro's; [...] that awakening at his cries, surprised by them, and at the sight [...] of the negroes with their bloody hatchets in their hands, he threw [...] himself into the sea through a window which was near him, and was [...] drowned, without it being in the power of the deponent to assist [...] or take him up; * * * that a short time after killing Aranda, they [...] brought upon deck his german-cousin, of middle-age, Don Francisco [...] Masa, of Mendoza, and the young Don Joaquin, Marques de [...] Aramboalaza, then lately from Spain, with his Spanish servant [...] Ponce, and the three young clerks of Aranda, José Mozairi Lorenzo [...] Bargas, and Hermenegildo Gandix, all of Cadiz; that Don Joaquin [...] and Hermenegildo Gandix, the negro Babo, for purposes hereafter to [...] appear, preserved alive; but Don Francisco Masa, José Mozairi, and [...] Lorenzo Bargas, with Ponce the servant, beside the boatswain, Juan [...] Robles, the boatswain's mates, Manuel Viscaya and Roderigo Hurta, [...] and four of the sailors, the negro Babo ordered to be thrown alive [...] into the sea, although they made no resistance, nor begged for [...] anything else but mercy; that the boatswain, Juan Robles, who knew [...] how to swim, kept the longest above water, making acts of [...] contrition, and, in the last words he uttered, charged this [...] deponent to cause mass to be said for his soul to our Lady of [...] Succor: * * * that, during the three days which followed, the [...] deponent, uncertain what fate had befallen the remains of Don [...] Alexandro, frequently asked the negro Babo where they were, and, [...] if still on board, whether they were to be preserved for interment [...] ashore, entreating him so to order it; that the negro Babo [...] answered nothing till the fourth day, when at sunrise, the [...] deponent coming on deck, the negro Babo showed him a skeleton, [...] which had been <b>substituted</b> for the <b>ship's</b> proper figure-head--the [...] image of Christopher Colon, the discoverer of the New World; that [...] the negro Babo asked him whose skeleton that was, and whether, [...] from its whiteness, he should not think it a white's; that, upon [...] discovering his face, the negro Babo, coming close, said words to [...] this effect: [...] "Keep faith with the blacks from here to Senegal, or [...] you shall in spirit, as now in body, follow your leader," [...] pointing [...] to the prow; * * * that the same morning the negro Babo took by [...] succession each Spaniard forward, and asked him whose skeleton [...] that was, and whether, from its whiteness, he should not think it [...] a white's; that each Spaniard covered his face; that then to each [...] the negro Babo repeated the words in the first place said to the [...] deponent; * * * that they (the Spaniards), being then assembled [...] aft, the negro Babo harangued them, saying that he had now done [...] all; that the deponent (as navigator for the negroes) might pursue [...] his course, warning him and all of them that they should, soul and [...] body, go the way of Don Alexandro, if he saw them (the Spaniards) [...] speak, or plot anything against them (the negroes)--a threat which [...] was repeated every day; that, before the events last mentioned, [...] they had tied the cook to throw him overboard, for it is not known [...] what thing they heard him speak, but finally the negro Babo [...] spared his life, at the request of the deponent; that a few days [...] after, the deponent, endeavoring not to omit any means to preserve [...] the lives of the remaining whites, spoke to the negroes peace and [...] tranquillity, and agreed to draw up a paper, signed by the [...] deponent and the sailors who could write, as also by the negro [...] Babo, for himself and all the blacks, in which the deponent [...] obliged himself to carry them to Senegal, and they not to kill any [...] more, and he formally to make over to them the ship, with the [...] cargo, with which they were for that time satisfied and quieted. * [...] * But the next day, the more surely to guard against the sailors' [...] escape, the negro Babo commanded all the boats to be destroyed but [...] the long-boat, which was unseaworthy, and another, a cutter in [...] good condition, which knowing it would yet be wanted for towing [...] the water casks, he had it lowered down into the hold.|$|R
