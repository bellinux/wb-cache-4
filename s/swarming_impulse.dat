50|$|The {{key factor}} in this is the {{prevention}} or skillful management of the <b>swarming</b> <b>impulse.</b> If a colony swarms unexpectedly and the beekeeper does not manage to capture the resulting swarm, {{he is likely to}} harvest significantly less honey from that hive, since he has lost half his worker bees at a single stroke. If, however, he can use the <b>swarming</b> <b>impulse</b> to breed a new queen but keep all the bees in the colony together, he maximizes his chances of a good harvest. It takes many years of learning and experience to be able to manage all these aspects successfully, though owing to variable circumstances many beginners often achieve a good honey harvest.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the modern}} Demaree method, the queen {{is placed in}} the bottom box, along with one or two frames of brood (but {{containing}} no open brood), as well as one or two frames of food stores, and empty combs or foundation. A queen excluder is placed above the bottom box, thereby restricting the queen to the bottom box but allowing bees to move freely between the bottom box {{and the rest of the}} hive. The original hive, along with all open brood, is placed above the queen excluder. The method works best if the nurse bees are remove far away from the queen. The distance between the queen and nurse bees can be increased by placing the brood nest at the very top of the hive, with the honey supers between the brood nest and the queen excluder. If any swarm cells are present, these must be destroyed by the beekeeper. The relative absence of queen pheromone in the top box usually prompts the nurse bees to create emergency cells. After 7-10 days, the beekeeper destroys the emergency cells, and then either removes the queen excluder (thereby ending the [...] "demaree") or repeats the process a second or a third time until the <b>swarming</b> <b>impulse</b> is over.|$|E
