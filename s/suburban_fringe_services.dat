50|$|In {{the late}} 1980’s Brisbane’s inner-city areas were {{struggling}} with economic stagnation, urban decay and crime {{which resulted in}} an exodus of residents and business to the <b>suburban</b> <b>fringe.</b> Established in 1991 as the Urban Renewal Taskforce, URB was responsible for revitalising derelict industrial areas in inner north-east suburbs of Fortitude Valley, New Farm, Teneriffe, Newstead and Bowen Hills.|$|R
50|$|The {{corridor}} between Burwood and the City was, {{for much}} of the 20th century, dominated by industrial land uses and low-density housing. As factories and warehouses decamped to greenfield sites on the <b>suburban</b> <b>fringe,</b> the opportunity to redevelop inner-city suburbs as high-density residential centres meant that local transport needs grew. Unsworth identified the corridor as strategic in 2004.|$|R

In addition to agricultural areas, nonmetro America includes sparsely populated mountainous regions, millions of acres of heavily forested areas, small towns, light manufacturing areas, tiny coastal hamlets, and the <b>suburban</b> <b>fringes</b> of growing metro areas. What we know about this heterogeneity is based largely on data for counties. This means that our understanding of nonmetro diversity comes from data on arbitrary political units.|$|R

50|$|The {{economic}} {{profile of}} the two regions is slightly different. Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands. However Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters {{of oil and gas}} exploration and drilling companies. Edmonton skews much more towards governments, universities and hospitals as large employers, while Edmonton’s <b>suburban</b> <b>fringes</b> (e.g. Fort Saskatchewan, Nisku, Strathcona County (Refinery Row), Leduc, Beaumont, Acheson) are home to most of the province’s manufacturing (much of it related to oil and gas).|$|R

50|$|This {{area was}} based on the seven county boroughs and four other non-county boroughs and urban districts around the fringe of the {{conurbation}} - Aldridge-Brownhills, Halesowen, Stourbridge, and Sutton Coldfield. The area was divided into seven new metropolitan boroughs - Aldridge-Brownhills was added to Walsall; Halesowen and Stourbridge to Dudley and Sutton Coldfield to Birmingham. A new borough of Sandwell was formed by the merger of West Bromwich and Warley, Solihull took in much of the <b>suburban</b> <b>fringe</b> to the east of Birmingham and the gap between Solihull and Coventry, whilst Wolverhampton and Coventry themselves were taken in more-or-less unaltered.|$|R
40|$|The electoral and {{political}} consequences of suburbanisation recently regained {{interest in the}} Anglo-Saxon literature, pointing to a growing polarisation between city and <b>suburban</b> <b>fringe.</b> This paper analyses these processes in the Antwerp urban region and shows {{the development of a}} similar electoral divide that is supported by the political parties involved. These observations add to the existing evidence that city-suburban polarisation in Belgium cannot be simply equated with the Anglo-Saxon experience, where a complete suburban fencing off from the city is observable. Rather, because of the comparatively limited development of functions in the Belgian suburbs, a suburban discourse emerges that focuses on safe and accessible cities for the suburban user, yet without much reference to its present inhabitants. ...|$|R
40|$|Necropsies were {{performed}} on 27 wild dogs professionally culled in the Townsville district of Australia between August and September 2002. The {{purpose of this study}} was to define the prevalence of parasitic infections present in the local wild dog population, with special focus on those of zoonotic potential, and to speculate as to the associated risks to the community's health. Collection of ectoparasites revealed the presence of one species of flea, Ctenocephalides felis (present in 35 % of wild dogs in this study), and two genera of ticks, Amblyomma sp. and Haemophysalis sp. (60 % and 47 % of wild dogs infected, respectively). Four species of helminth were found in the intestines: Ancylostoma caninum (74 % of sample population infected), Dipylidium caninum (59 % of wild dogs infected), Spirometra erinacei (49 % of wild dogs infected), and Echinococcus granulosus (22 % of wild dogs infected). Dirofilaria immitis was present in the heart and pulmonary arteries of 75 % of the adult dogs. Plasma from these dogs was also tested for dirofilariasis by two different methods, an ELISA and a commercially available kit. Results from a haemagglutination-inhibition test performed on these samples demonstrated antibodies to parvovirus in 27 % of the dogs. It was concluded that encroachment of wild dogs into the <b>suburban</b> <b>fringes</b> of Townsville presents a low risk to public health and the health of adequately cared for domestic dogs.

40|$|During {{the fifteen}} years {{following}} World War Two, thousands of aspiring home-owners on Sydney’s <b>suburban</b> <b>fringe</b> lived in residential subdivisions without basic household amenities and public infrastructure. Aspiring homeowners {{took advantage of}} the sale of subdivided agricultural land to purchase land and build a temporary dwelling while they saved to pay for a permanent cottage on site. Living without services was challenging. Once a permanent home was achieved, sometimes after many years, residents still had to contend with a lack of public infrastructure. In this adaptive incremental way, many Sydney residents acquired basic shelter and moved into home-ownership. This paper describes residents’ experiences of living in ‘prematurely developed’ areas on the urban fringe of Sydney in the 1940 s and 1950 s...|$|R
40|$|A {{psychiatric}} morbidity assessment {{was conducted on}} students from 3 different secondary schools and a university. A total number of 1260 respondents from a questionnaire were collected. Tertiary education imposed high incidences of emotional health problems in contrast to secondary level. This was partially attributed {{to the existence of}} predominant severe cases among the undergraduates. There were differences in the age groups and gender. The Year 1 and females had higher scores than their respective co variables. Possible explanations for this poor state of health could be due to depressive life episodes and/or of a serious financial hardship. Subsequently, the GHQ scores indicated no effect of urbanization,. although students from USM and SMZ-I (located in towns) were more secretive and susceptible towards examination stigma compared to their counterparts in the <b>suburban</b> <b>fringes...</b>|$|R
50|$|Most of Manchester, and its <b>suburban</b> <b>fringe</b> to the south, {{is located}} on Permian {{sandstones}} and red Triassic sandstones and mudstones, mantled by thick deposits of till and pockets of sand and gravel deposited by glaciers {{at the end of}} the last glacial period, some 15,000 years ago. The oldest rocks, from the Upper Carboniferous period, are sandstones and shales of Millstone Grit present as outcrops and uplands in the north-east of Greater Manchester, such as the upland moors of Dark Peak and South Pennines to the east and northeast of Rochdale, Oldham and Stalybridge. These rocks are overlain by shales, mudstones and thin coals of Coal Measures upon which the towns of Oldham, Rochdale, Bolton and Wigan are located. An outcrop of Coal Measures extends southwards down through Tameside and into Hazel Grove.|$|R

50|$|Solihull took {{in much of}} the <b>suburban</b> <b>fringe</b> to {{the east}} of Birmingham, {{including}} the former villages of Chelmsley Wood and Castle Bromwich, also Birmingham Airport, and the area of countryside between Solihull and Coventry, whilst Coventry itself received only small changes and Wolverhampton was unaltered. This led to (apart from in the east, with Coventry and the Meriden Gap) quite a tightly defined metropolitan border, excluding such places as Burntwood, Bromsgrove, Cannock, Kidderminster, Lichfield and Wombourne which had been considered for inclusion in the West Midlands metropolitan area by the Redcliffe-Maud Report. The 1974 reform created the West Midlands County Council that covered the entire area and dealt with strategic issues. A new West Midlands Police service was formed covering the entire area, with the West Midlands Constabulary and Birmingham City Police abolished, and also taking over responsibility from the county forces.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, nearly 40 acres (16 ha) of the city's {{downtown}} were razed in {{an attempt}} at urban renewal, as population and businesses had moved to a <b>suburban</b> <b>fringe</b> along newly constructed highways. The Keystone Hotel and Worth Block (former home of the House of Lords) were notable historic structures that were demolished. Christman's Department Store stands (converted into loft apartments), as does the Joplin Union Depot, since railroad restructuring and the decline in passenger traffic led to its closure. Other notable historic structures in Joplin include the Carnegie Library, Fred and Red's Diner, the Frisco Depot, the Scottish Rite Cathedral, and the Crystal Cave (filled in and used for a parking lot). The Newman Mercantile Store has been adapted for use as City Hall. The Fox Theatre has been adapted for use as the Central Christian Center.|$|R
40|$|Park-and-ride lots are {{specialized}} {{parking lots}} typically {{located on the}} <b>suburban</b> <b>fringe</b> of urbanized areas. These lots are strategically placed outside of the “ring of congestion ” on major commuter corridors. Services offered at park-and-rides may include local fixed routes, express bus, bus rapid transit, and rail. They are designed to transfer commuters from low-occupancy modes (personal cars) to high-occupancy modes (rail, bus, van- and carpools). Services from park-and-ride lots are designed to concentrate transit demand, enabling transit services that could not otherwise be cost-effective. Typical park-and-ride amenities include covered or enclosed waiting areas, benches, and sometimes vending machines and restrooms. Lots can vary in size from 200 to over 7, 500 spaces, {{and can be used}} exclusively for transit or offer shared uses, such as vanpool staging. Transit fares from park-and-rides are typically higher than basic local fares, and parking may be free or cost a small fee...|$|R
40|$|Current {{trends in}} {{household}} formation and housing {{development in the}} United States are creating pressures on communities to provide adequate infrastructure services for a growing population. Homeownership rates are the highest in history. All indications suggest this rate {{will continue to increase}} over the next few years. Builders and developers respond to this need by constructing housing units in <b>suburban</b> <b>fringe</b> and rural areas because of the availability of cheaper land and the lack of attractive sites in more urban areas. Environmental regulations are frequently cited as barriers to development and impediments to affordability. This paper reviews the literature of potential linkages between housing affordability and environmental protection and reports on a project in which focus groups were conducted with developers, environmental regulators, and others. Content analysis of focus group transcripts showed much agreement from various sides of the complicated and interconnected issues that are related to sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses GIS {{techniques}} to examine patterns of economic {{change in a}} nine-county central Iowa region between 1987 and 1995 and to relate these changes to investments in transportation infrastructure {{during the same time}} period. Specifically, the economic change will include property valuation change for residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural classes of property. A mapping of valuation changes in this region depicts the major shifts in capital wealth. Overall, a growing metro core city is ringed by high growth urbanized clusters at the fringe. Nonurbanized cities located within 20 miles of the metro core also grew strongly. Residential values declined in the core city while growing dramatically in the <b>suburban</b> <b>fringes.</b> Commercial values grew strongly in the metro core and even more so in the western suburbs.
