40|$|Abstract—In the {{system-level}} {{design of}} MPSoCs (Multi-Processor <b>System-on-a-Chips),</b> system designers start from de-scribing {{functionalities of the}} system as processes and channels, and then decide mapping of them to various Processing Elements (PEs) including CPUs and dedicated hardware modules. A mapping decision is evaluated by simulation or FPGA-based prototyping. Designers iterate mapping and evaluation until all design requirements are met. We have developed two profilers, a process profiler and a memory profiler, for FPGA-based performance analysis of design candidates. The process profiler records a trace of process activations, while the memory profiler records a trace of channel accesses. According to mapping of processes to PEs, the profilers are automatically configured and instrumented into FPGA-based system prototypes by a system-level design tool that we have developed. Designers therefore need to manually modify neither the system description nor the profilers upon each change of process mapping. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our profilers, a case study on MPEG 4 decoder design was conducted. I...|$|R
40|$|In shared bus-based {{multiprocessor}} <b>system-on-a-chips</b> (MP-SoCs), snoop-based schemes {{are widely}} used to maintain cache coherency. However, many of broadcasts are useless because remote caches seldom have the matching blocks and their tag lookups do not supply data. From the energy perspective, such tag lookups consume unnecessary energy and make the system energy wasteful. In this paper, we propose a broadcast filtering technique to reduce snoop-energy in both of cache and bus. Broadcast filtering is achieved by help of snooping cache and splitbus. The snooping cache checks if matching blocks exist in remote caches before broadcasting a coherency request. If no remote cache has the matching block, it eliminates the broadcast. If broadcasting is necessary, {{only a part of}} splitbus is used so that the request is selectively broadcasted only to the remote caches that have matching blocks. Simulation results show that our technique reduces 90 %, 50 %, and 30 % of cache lookups, bus usage, and snoop-energy, respectively, with only 2 % of degradation in performance. Our technique reduces more energy than other state-of-the-art techniques...|$|R
40|$|The ongoing {{technological}} {{advances in the}} semiconductor industry make Multi-Processor <b>System-on-a-Chips</b> (MPSoCs) more attractive, because uniprocessor solutions do not scale satisfactorily with increasing transistor counts. In conjunction with the increasing rates of transient faults in logic and memory associated with the continuous reduction of feature sizes, this situation creates the need for novel MP-SoC architectures. This paper introduces such an architecture, which supports the integration of multiple, heterogeneous IP cores that are interconnected by a time-triggered Network-on-a-Chip (NoC). Through its inherent fault isolation and determinism, the proposed MPSoC provides the basis for fault tolerance using Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). On-chip TMR improves the reliability of a MPSoC, e. g., by tolerating a transient fault {{in one of three}} replicated IP cores. Off-chip TMR with three MPSoCs can be used in the development of ultra-dependable applications (e. g., X-by-wire), where the reliability requirements exceed the reliability that is achievable using a single MPSoC. The paper quantifies the reliability benefits of the proposed MP-SoC architecture by means of reliability modeling. These results demonstrate that the combination of on-chip and offchip TMR contributes towards building more dependable distributed embedded real-time systems...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{semiconductor}} design methods {{makes it}} possible to design increasingly complex <b>system-on-a-chips</b> (SOCs). Testing such SOCs becomes highly expensive due to the rapidly increasing test data volumes with longer test times as a result. Several approaches exist to compress the test stimuli and where hardware is added for decompression. This master’s thesis presents a test data compression method based on a modified facsimile code. An embedded processor on the SOC is used to decompress and apply the data to the cores of the SOC. The use of already existing hardware reduces the need of additional hardware. Test data may be rearranged in some manners which will affect the compression ratio. Several modifications are discussed and tested. To be realistic a decompressing algorithm {{has to be able to}} run on a system with limited resources. With an assembler implementation it is shown that the proposed method can be effectively realized in such environments. Experimental results where the proposed method is applied to benchmark circuits show that the method compares well with similar methods. A method of including the response vector is also presented. This approach {{makes it possible}} to abort a test as soon as an error is discovered, still compressing the data used. To correctly compare the test response with the expected one the data needs to include don’t care bits. The technique uses a mask vector to mark the don’t care bits.

40|$|Design of Multiprocessor <b>System-on-a-Chips</b> (MPSoC) {{currently}} {{suffers from}} poor tool support. MPSoC {{is considered to}} be the next general design platform for embedded system designs. As complex designs such as multimedia and gaming processing become more common in handheld devices and traditional ASIC solutions are too slow and too expensive, MPSoC allows a fast software solution by running multiple low-cost, low-speed, low-power embedded processors in parallel and combining their processing power to solve more complex computation problems. However, current design methodologies for MPSoC generally restrict the specification of the software for the convenience that it can be analyzed statically. Such restrictions prevent MPSoC designs to reach their full potentials. In this thesis, I propose an MPSoC design methodology that does not impose unnecessary restrictions on the software. Specifically, Kahn Process Network (KPN) is used to model the applications such that each process in the KPN process networks can be expressed by the full power of high-level programming languages. Unfortunately, allowing the full power of high-level programming languages prevents the software to be analyzed statically. Therefore, similar to optimizing software for single-processor systems, a profile-based methodology is proposed to explore the vast design space of MPSoC for applications written in KPN. There are two main ingredients in the methodology. 1. The MPSoC simulation must be made both fast and accurate. The speed of the simulation must allow designers to modify and experiment different design options in the limited design time allocated for system-level design exploration. At the same time the simulation must be accurate enough for the exploration results to be meaningful. A new MPSoC simulation framework that simulates in the speed close to behavioral simulation and generates performance results with less than 5 % error is shown. 2. An analysis from the simulation must provide accurate MPSoC-specific profiling information about the implementation for guiding the designers to make design decisions. Execution characteristics of MPSoC make such profiling information very different from single-processor systems. A new profiling technique specifically to determine performance-critical information for MPSoC is described. Three optimization techniques at various implementation levels that use the proposed methodology are shown and applied to an MPEG- 2 Decoder design. The experiments show that the optimization techniques using the methodology can efficiently optimize the implementations in term of performance, power and area. The results show that the methodology allows designers to explore the MPSoC design space more efficiently with the accurate MPSoC profiling information...|$|R
