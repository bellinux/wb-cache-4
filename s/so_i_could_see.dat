500|$|Unable {{to contain}} her fires, Kaga {{survivors}} were taken {{off by the}} destroyers [...] and [...] between 14:00 and 17:00. Around 19:25 she was scuttled by two torpedoes from Hagikaze and sank stern-first at position [...] Ensign Takeshi Maeda, an injured Kaga B5N aircrew member rescued by Hagikaze, described the scene: [...] "My comrade carried me up to the deck <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the last moments of our beloved carrier, which was nearby. Even though I was in pain tears started to run down my cheeks, and everyone around me was crying; {{it was a very}} sad sight." ...|$|E
500|$|Monteux {{appeared}} as guest conductor with many orchestras; he commented in 1955, [...] "I regret they don't have symphony orchestras {{all over the}} world <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Burma and Samarkand". His successor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Serge Koussevitzky, invited many guest conductors during his twenty-five years in charge; Monteux was never among them, probably, in Canarina's view, because of Koussevitzky's jealousy. In 1949 Koussevitzky was succeeded by Charles Munch, whose early career had been boosted by an invitation from Monteux to conduct the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris in 1933. Munch invited Monteux to Boston as a guest conductor in the 1951 season. The engagement was greeted with enthusiasm by the critics and the public, and Munch invited Monteux to join him the following year in heading the orchestra's first European tour. The high point of the tour was a performance under Monteux of The Rite of Spring at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées, {{in the presence of the}} composer. Monteux returned annually to Boston every year until his death.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} a new character {{created by the}} winner of the [...] "Best. Character. Ever." [...] contest, in which fans could submit their own ideas for a new, and possibly recurring, Simpsons character. Over 25,000 entries were sent in. The winner of the contest was Peggy Black from Orange, Connecticut, who created the character Ricardo Bomba. She described Ricardo as [...] "someone that all the women love and all the men want to be". Black's inspiration for the character came from {{the fact that there were}} no characters like him on The Simpsons, and she thought Springfield needed [...] "something like a Casanova". As part of the winning prize, Black was sent to work with the show's producers in Los Angeles. She worked with the animators to bring the character to life. In an interview with the Associated Press, Black stated she [...] "described the character and they drew him <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> if that was my vision of him". She continued, [...] "It's amazing to see how they captured what I imagined. He's over the top." [...] Executive producer Al Jean was one of the judges of the contest, which he described as [...] "a thank you to loyal fans". Jean also noted that there is a possibility the Ricardo character might appear on the show again although this seems unlikely since the character appears to have been killed in a fiery car crash.|$|E

"'I don't believe I'd care {{to trust}} Bunny {{in such a}} job as that,' Mr. Turtle said, looking {{out of the corner}} of his eye at me as if to say that I was to keep my paws out of his pies, which I was {{perfectly}} willing to do. 'If you'd turn around, Mr. Hedgehog, <b>so's</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> just which quill I wanted it wouldn't take me long to get what I needed.' ...|$|R

60|$|Before me, in {{the bottom}} of the boat, lay Maud. She, at least, was warm, for under her and over her were thick blankets. The top one I had drawn over her face to shelter it from the night, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing but the vague shape of her, and her light-brown hair, escaped from the {{covering}} and jewelled with moisture from the air.|$|E

60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{he drew a}} little {{penknife}} from his pocket, opened the smaller blade, and moved his chair <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his thigh. Then, choosing the place deliberately, he drove the blade into his leg and withdrew it.|$|R
6000|$|Mar. [...] My husband! [...] I {{have sued}} to {{accompany}} thee hence, [...] 140 [...] And not so hopelessly. This love of thine [...] For an ungrateful and tyrannic soil [...] Is Passion, and not Patriotism; for me, [...] <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> thee {{with a quiet}} aspect, [...] And the sweet freedom {{of the earth and}} air, [...] I would not cavil about climes or regions. [...] This crowd of palaces and prisons is not [...] A Paradise; its first inhabitants [...] Were wretched exiles.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Ravenor rose at her {{entrance}} and bowed with the easy grace {{of a man}} of the world. My mother returned his greeting with a stately self-possession which matched his own; but it struck me, watching them both closely, that, while he was perfectly collected, she was in reality far from being <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the delicate white fingers of her left hand fold themselves convulsively around the lace handkerchief which she was carrying, and when she entered a shiver--gone in a moment and perceptible only to me, because my eyes were fastened upon her--shook her slim, lithe figure.|$|E
60|$|I obeyed, and {{the women}} bowed and went. Then Ayesha drew up her veil, and knelt down by the bed of Inez, but in such a fashion that I could not see her face {{although}} I admit that I tried to do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> however, that she set her lips against those of Inez and as I gathered by her motions, seemed to breathe into her lips. Also she lifted her hands and placing one of them upon the heart of Inez, {{for a minute or}} more swayed the other from side to side above her eyes, pausing at times to touch her upon the forehead with her finger-tips.|$|E

60|$|Mr Mackenzie turned pale {{as death}} under his red skin. We were {{standing}} opposite the hall door, {{and there was}} a light in it <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> He snatched the head up by the hair and held it against the light.|$|R
6000|$|I {{know not}} whether Verena was provoked, but she {{answered}} with more spirit than sequence: [...] "Well, {{you know you}} did pour contempt on us, ever <b>so</b> much; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> how it worked Olive up. Are you {{not going to see}} her at all?" ...|$|R
60|$|Opposite to this lady, {{and with}} her face fully tamed to me, was a kindly-looking, fat motherly woman, with light-coloured hair, {{not in the best}} order. She was hot and scarlet with exercise, being perhaps too stout for the steep steps of the fortress; and in one hand she held a handkerchief, with which from time to time she wiped her brow. In the other hand she held one of the {{extremities}} of my friend's property, feeling--good, careful soul!--what was the texture of the cloth. As she did <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> a glance of approbation pass across her warm features. I liked that lady's face, in spite of her untidy hair, and felt that had she been alone my friend would not have been injured.|$|E
60|$|I {{was at the}} curtains, {{and they}} did not hang close, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> clearly into the little cavern beyond them. It had all the {{appearance}} of being a tomb, and was lit up by a fire that burnt in its centre with a whitish flame and without smoke. Indeed, there, to the left, was a stone shelf with a little ledge to it three inches or so high, and on the shelf lay what I took to be a corpse; at any rate, it looked like one, with something white thrown over it. To the right was a similar shelf, on which lay some broidered coverings. Over the fire bent the figure of a woman; she was sideways to me and facing the corpse, wrapped in a dark mantle that hid her like a nun's cloak. She seemed to be staring at the flickering flame. Suddenly, as I was trying to make up my mind what to do, with a convulsive movement that somehow gave an impression of despairing energy, the woman rose to her feet and cast the dark cloak from her.|$|E
60|$|Dragging my bags I hurried {{toward the}} fire. Nielsen was {{building}} a barricade of rocks to block the flying sparks. Suddenly I espied Romer. He sat on a log close to the blaze. His position struck me as singular, so I dropped my burdens and went to him. He had on a heavy coat over sweater and under coat, which made him resemble a little old man. His sombrero was slouched down sidewise, his gloved hands were folded across his knees, his body sagged a little to one side, his head drooped. He was asleep. I got around <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{his face in the}} firelight. Pale, weary, a little sad, very youthful and yet determined! A bloody bruise showed over his temple. He had said he would ride all the way to Mormon Lake and he had done it. Never, never will that picture fade from my memory! Dear, brave, wild, little lad! He had made for me a magnificent success of this fruitless hunting trip. I hoped and prayed then that when he grew to man's estate, and faced the long rides down the hard roads of life, he would meet them and achieve them as he had the weary thirty-five Arizona miles from Long Valley to Mormon Lake.|$|E
60|$|I {{bowed and}} made no answer, after which he and his companions opened the bags of gold to show {{me that it was}} there, {{offering}} to weigh it again against my servant, the dwarf, <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that nothing had been taken away.|$|R
60|$|I {{had stepped}} {{underneath}} the open hatchway <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> him. The lack of {{expression on his}} face, so different from when I had watched him unseen, was enhanced by the unblinking, staring eyes. It was not a pleasant face to look upon.|$|R
60|$|Miss Havisham sat {{listening}} (or {{it seemed}} <b>so,</b> for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> her face), but still made no answer.|$|R
5000|$|Living in Bangladesh, he was {{surrounded}} by people in poverty and developed a deep appreciation for his own life. In his words, [...] "I feel so lucky that I had parents who could give me food, clean water, a bed to sleep in and treatment <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> If I was born into a poor family I {{would not be able to}} see the world today." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Presently he was <b>so</b> close <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{his face}} clearly. It was a narrow face, with dull gray eyes, {{and a black}} moustache.

6000|$|... "It was cold," [...] said Weekum, [...] "and {{the snow}} {{got in my}} eyes, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see.</b> Then <b>I</b> kept on till I fell in the snow, without knowing where I was, and the wind blew the flakes over me and covered me up." ...|$|R

5000|$|Leight went on {{to discuss}} about the episode and {{obstacles}} in David Haden's and Detective Benson's relationship, [...] "They may disagree on a case. She may question his commitment because she's such a crusader. If you work as a No. 2 in a New York City D.A.'s office, {{you have to have}} political skill. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her mistaking his political skill for a lack of fervor. And clearly, they're not supposed to be working on the same cases. That'll get a case thrown out of court. The ethical boundary is a huge, huge issue. But then also there's this question of boundaries in a relationship. If both of you do the same kind of stuff, and you're always talking shop — is that healthy for a relationship?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{character}} of Piper Halliwell was conceived by Burge, {{who wrote the}} pilot script for Charmed. The pilot script was based around three mismatched sisters who are initially based on Burge and her two older sisters, Laura and Edie Burge. Piper is based on Burge's second-oldest sister Edie. On creating Piper, Burge stated [...] "The middle sibling typically {{tends to be a}} real people pleaser and very funny, tends to deal with life with a lot of humour. That really applied to my sister, Edie and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the {{character of}} Piper her." [...] Executive producer Brad Kern stated that Piper was written into the series as [...] "the middle sister just trying to keep the peace, trying to find love, trying to find her career, and trying to keep Prue and Phoebe from killing each other." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{made by the}} Philippine Daily Inquirer in September 2013, apl.de.ap was asked why he accepted his stint as coach in the show. He replied, [...] "My friend, will.i.am, since {{he was doing it}} in London, suggested it to me. [...] "You gotta do 'The Voice.'" [...] And I'm like, [...] "Really? I don't know man, I'm not sure.” Because I have to comment on the people and I'm nearsighted, and I was scared that I'm not gonna see their expressions while they were singing. But I came up with the idea—only if they can put a screen at the bottom of my chair <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> their facial expression, their energy, the way they’re singing. That made me comfortable. OK, now I could do it." [...] On asked what he loved about the show, he said, [...] "I’ve always been into discovering new Filipino artists. I’ve wanted to give them the same opportunity that I had. I like it because there are no boundaries. Anyone can join [...] "The Voice" [...] as long as they could sing. You can be old, you can be any gender. It doesn’t matter. It’s all about the voice {{at the end of the}} day." ...|$|E
