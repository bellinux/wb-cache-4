25|$|As can be seen, the semi-implicit method can {{simulate}} correctly both stable <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> {{their roots}} in the left half plane and unstable <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> {{their roots in}} the right half plane. This is clear advantage over forward (standard) Euler and backward Euler. Forward Euler tends to have less damping than the real system when the negative real parts of the roots get near the imaginary axis and backward Euler may show the system be stable even when the roots are in the right half plane.|$|E

30|$|The {{frequency}} of shifting bottlenecks increases for systems with smaller buffer inventories, i.e., a <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> only two parts between processes shifts {{more frequently than}} a <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> ten parts.|$|R
30|$|Compared to the <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> perfect CSI at {{both the}} {{transmitter}} and the receiver (14), in the end-to-end channel capacity of the <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> outdated CSI at the transmitter (25), the co-channel interference by outdated CSI is added.|$|R

25|$|<b>Systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> these {{restrictions}} cause incompatibilities {{with some other}} filesystems. For example, Windows will fail to handle, or raise error reports for, these legal UNIX filenames: aux.c, q"uote"s.txt, or NUL.txt.|$|E
25|$|For all causal {{and stable}} <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> the same {{magnitude}} response, the minimum phase system has the minimum group delay. The following proof illustrates {{this idea of}} minimum group delay.|$|E
25|$|Such {{a system}} is called a maximum-phase system because it has the maximum group delay of the set of <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> the same {{magnitude}} response. In this set of equal-magnitude-response systems, the maximum phase system will have maximum energy delay.|$|E

25|$|For all causal {{and stable}} <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> the same {{magnitude}} response, the minimum phase system has its energy concentrated near {{the start of}} the impulse response. i.e., it minimizes the following function which we can think of as the delay of energy in the impulse response.|$|E
25|$|GPS based methods. An {{increasing}} number of vehicles are equipped with in-vehicle satnav/GPS (satellite navigation) <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> two-way communication with a traffic data provider. Position readings from these vehicles are used to compute vehicle speeds. Modern methods may not use dedicated hardware but instead Smartphone based solutions using so called Telematics 2.0 approaches.|$|E
25|$|Embedded <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> fixed {{deadlines}} use a real-time {{operating system}} such as VxWorks, PikeOS, eCos, QNX, MontaVista Linux and RTLinux. Windows CE is a real-time operating system that shares similar APIs to desktop Windows but shares none of desktop Windows' codebase. Symbian OS {{also has an}} RTOS kernel (EKA2) starting with version 8.0b.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes a {{representation}} like Un*x, *NIX, or *N?X {{is used to}} indicate all operating systems similar to Unix. This comes {{from the use of}} the asterisk (*) and the question mark characters as wildcard indicators in many utilities. This notation is also used to describe other Unix-like <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> not met the requirements for UNIX branding from the Open Group.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept has}} been {{developed}} for technology and economics {{in the identification of}} new techno-economic paradigms as changes in technological <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> a major influence on the behaviour of the entire economy (Carlota Perez; earlier work only on technological paradigms by Giovanni Dosi). This concept is linked to Joseph Schumpeter's idea of creative destruction. Examples include the move to mass production and the introduction of microelectronics.|$|E
25|$|Some {{companies}} have been producing high-end <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been widely used in established BCI labs for several years. These systems typically entail more channels than the low-cost systems below, with much higher signal quality and robustness in real-world settings.

25|$|Practitioners {{of system}} {{analysis}} are often {{called up to}} dissect <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> grown haphazardly to determine the current components of the system.

Employment utilizing system analysis include system analyst, business analyst, manufacturing engineer, system architect, enterprise architect, software architect, etc.|$|E
25|$|In {{the quantum}} {{mechanical}} description of electron and nuclear spin <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> {{a limited number}} of possible states, and therefore a discrete upper limit of energy they can attain, it is possible to obtain a negative temperature, which is numerically indeed less than absolute zero. However, this is not the macroscopic temperature of the material, but instead the temperature of only very specific degrees of freedom, that are isolated from others and do not exchange energy by virtue of the equipartition theorem.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of computer <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been hacked or victims of extortion. One such example occurred in September 1995 where a Russian national allegedly masterminded the break-in of Citicorp's electronic funds transfer system and was ordered to stand trial in the United States. A gang of hackers under his leadership had breached Citicorp's security 40 times during 1994. They were able to transfer $12 million from customer accounts and withdraw an estimated $400,000.|$|E

In Israel, most catalogs and maps use the Hebrew script, but romanized maps are easily {{available}} and road signs include romanized names. Some Hebrew speakers use romanization to communicate when using internet <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> poor support for the Hebrew alphabet. Romanized Hebrew {{is also used}} in music scores, in part because music is written left-to-right and Hebrew is written right-to-left.|$|E
25|$|There {{are vastly}} {{more complex and}} faster-responding <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> sought {{solutions}} for control and whereby the engineering and mathematics of dynamical systems have provided such solutions. For starter, in control theory a true closed-loop feedback pump will have to infuse not just rapid-acting insulin for positive errors, but also infuse glucagon for negative errors. For managing complex life situations, the pump will need several MEMS-based sensors to monitor more than just glucose, for example heart rate, breathing, ECG, temperature, CO2, blood pH, dissolved O2, etc.|$|E

India's Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine (which also includes acupuncture) are two alternative therapy <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been studied and adopted to a great extent. For instance, in the early 1970s the US medical establishment {{did not believe in}} the usefulness of acupuncture. Since then studies have proven the efficacy of acupuncture for different applications, especially for treatment of chronic pain. It is now covered by many health insurance plans.|$|E
