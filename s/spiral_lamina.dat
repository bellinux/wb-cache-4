40|$|The Kimmeridgian shallow-water carbonates of the Swiss Jura Mountains display stratigraphic levels {{containing}} mass accumulations of nerineoidean gastropods. The macro- and microfacies of {{the rocks}} with these nerineoidean assemblages suggest that their occurrence was related to water depth, physical energy within the habitat, sedimentation rate, substrate stability, and food supply. Typical nerineoidean shells are high spired and exhibit unique <b>spiral</b> <b>laminae</b> (folds) on the internal walls. Mass accumulations consisting of large, heavy individuals are believed to represent a semisessile, suspension-feeding community that utilized an external food source. During times of enhanced precipitation and run-off from the hinterland, terrestrial organic matter may have been supplied into the shallow sea, thus forming a source of food for the nerineoids. Alternatively, relative sea-level change during transgression {{may have led to}} large-scale coastal erosion and flooding of the platform, also potentially leading to a mobilization of organic matter. Size and morphology of the high-spired shells seem to indicate a trend toward maximal external volume. Development of folds within the shell is interpreted as a modification to maintain a small internal volume. The faunal and floral composition of the strata indicates a suspension-rich, high-energy environment with a low-sedimentation rate and a stable substrate. This allowed mass colonization by epifaunal nerineoids, which, in turn, formed a frameworklike structure. The heavy shells acted as a grid, trapping the sediment in between. In this way, a reinforced carbonate accumulation formed...|$|R

Objective: To {{examine the}} risk of pneumococcal meningitis in healthy rats that received a severe surgical trauma to the modiolus and osseous <b>spiral</b> <b>lamina</b> or the standard insertion technique for acute cochlear implantation. Design: Interventional animal studies. Subjects: Fifty-four otologically normal adult Hooded- Wistar rats. Interventions: Fifty-four rats (18 of which received a cochleostomy alone; 18, a cochleostomy and acute cochlear implantation using standard surgical techniques; and 18, a cochleostomy followed by severe inner ear trauma) were infected 4 weeks after surgery with Streptococcus pneumoniae via 3 different routes (hematogenous, middle ear, and inner ear) to represent all potential routes of bacterial infection from the upper respiratory tract to the meninges in cochlear implant recipients with meningitis. Results: Severe trauma to the osseous <b>spiral</b> <b>lamina</b> and modiolus increased {{the risk of}} pneumococcal meningitis when the bacteria were given via the middle or inner ear (Fisher exact test, P<. 05). However, the risk of meningitis did not change when the bacteria were given via the hematogenous route. Acute electrode insertion did not alter the risk of subsequent pneumococcal meningitis for any route of infection. Conclusions: Severe inner ear surgical trauma to the osseous <b>spiral</b> <b>lamina</b> and modiolus can {{increase the risk of}} pneumococcal meningitis. Therefore, every effort should be made to ensure that cochlear implant design and insertion technique cause minimal trauma to the bony structures of the inner ear {{to reduce the risk of}} pneumococcalmeningitis.

Both cochleostomy (CO) and round window (RW) techniques are used today. In {{the present study}} we analyzed size variations and topographic anatomy of the ‘hook’ region of the human cochlea to better compre- hend the Testo effects of various electric array insertion modes. Material and Methods: Size variations of the cochle- ar ‘hook’ region were assessed in 23 human, microdissected temporal bones by measuring the distances between the oval and round windows, also outlining the spiral ligament/ <b>spiral</b> <b>lamina.</b> Influence of size variations on spiral ligament position and fundamentals for different surgical approaches were evaluated in a subset of ‘small’ and ‘large’ cochleae per- forming different types of CO. In addition, {{the relationship between the}} microdissected accessory canal housing the inferior cochlear vein and the RW was analyzed. Results: The lateral vestibular wall and the cochlear ‘hook’ displayed large anatomic variations that greatly influenced the size of the potential surgical area.

Conclu- sion: Preoperative assessment of the distance between the round and oval windows may direct the surgeon before CI hearing-preservation surgery.

Background. Postoperative imaging after cochlear implantation is usually performed by conventional cochlear view (X-ray) or by multislice computed tomography (MSCT). MSCT after cochlear implantation often provides multiple metal artefacts; thus, a more detailed view of the implant considering the given anatomy is desirable.

No gentamicin fluorescence was observed in the Hensen / Claudius cells, the ventral region of the spiral ligament, the stria vascularis and the spiral ganglion.

The gentamicin flurescence increased at higher concentrations. Gentamicin exposure led to more pronounced gentamicin fluorescence in the cochlea compared to the vestibule.

Different studies show that cochlear implant could have inverse effects on vestibular structures. We aimed to investigate vestibular evoked myogenic {{potential in}} unilateral cochlear implanted individuals in compare to normal individuals. Methods: Thirty-three unilateral cochlear implanted patients (mean age 19. 96 years) and 30 normal hearing individuals (mean age 24 - 27 years) as control group were enrolled in this cross- sectional study. Absolute latencies and amplitudes of myogenic potential responses were measured and compared in both groups. Results: Myogenic potential recorded in both ears of all controls were normal. No response could be recorded in 16 patients (48. 48 %) from both ears. In three patients, responses were recorded in both ears though the amplitude of waves was reduced in implanted ear.

In the current study, we observed peripheral glial cells expressing SOX 10, SOX 9 and S 100 B as early as 9 weeks of gestation (W 9) in all three neuronal domains. We propose that these cells are the common precursor to both mature Schwann cells and satellite glial cells. Additionally, the peripheral glial cells located along the peripheral processes expressed NGFR, indicating a phenotype distinct from the peripheral glial cells located along the central processes. From W 12, the spiral ganglion was gradually populated by satellite glial cells in a spatiotemporal gradient. In the cochlear nerve, radial sorting was accomplished by W 22 and myelination started prior to myelination of the peripheral processes. The developmental dynamics of the peripheral glial cells in the human fetal cochlea is in support of a neural crest origin.

We determined their vectors with respect to the mid-modiolar axis and posterior round window edge and assessed if they intersected the chorda tympani nerve. RESULTS: The typical vector obtained with these 3 -D models ran in an anterosuperior direction, through the inferior part of the facial recess and anterior round window edge. In 7 of 10 temporal bones, this trajectory intersected the chorda tympani nerve. Based on the vectors, dummy probes were implanted in 3 of 10 temporal bones, and the need for chorda tympani removal was confirmed in accordance with the 3 -D models. Postoperative micro-CT scans revealed that all probes were successfully implanted in the cochlear nerve, whereas the osseous <b>spiral</b> <b>lamina</b> and basilar membrane were preserved. CONCLUSION: The vector for drilling and implantation found in this study {{can be used as a}} guideline for real-life surgery and, therefore, is another step toward the clinical implementation of cochlear nerve implants...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous neural {{activity}} {{has been recorded}} in the auditory nerve of cats as early as 2 days postnatal (P 2), yet individual auditory neurons {{do not respond to}} ambient sound levels below 90 – 100 dB SPL until about P 10. Significant refinement of the central projections from the spiral ganglion to the cochlear nucleus occurs during this neonatal period. This refinement may be dependent on peripheral spontaneous discharge activity. We recorded from single spiral ganglion cells in kittens aged P 3 to P 9. The spiral ganglion was accessed via the round window through the <b>spiral</b> <b>lamina.</b> A total of 112 ganglion cells were isolated for study in 9 animals. Spike rates in neonates were very low, ranging from 0. 06 to 56 sp/s with a mean of 3. 09 +/ − 8. 24 sp/s. Ganglion cells in neonatal kittens exhibited remarkable repetitive spontaneous bursting discharge patterns. The unusual patterns were evident in the large mean interval coefficient of variation (CVi = 2. 9 +/− 1. 6) and burst index of 5. 2 +/ − 3. 5 across ganglion cells. Spontaneous bursting patterns in these neonatal mammals were similar to those reported for cochlear ganglion cells of the embryonic chicken suggesting this may be a general phenomenon that is common across animal classes. Rhythmic spontaneous discharge of retinal ganglion cells {{has been shown to be}} important in the development of central retinotopic projections and normal binocular vision (Shatz, 1996, Proc Natl Acad Sci 93). Bursting rhythms in cochlear ganglion cells may play a similar role in the auditory system during pre-hearing periods...|$|E
40|$|The ephrins and Eph receptors make up {{two large}} {{families}} of bi-directional signaling molecules {{that are known}} {{to play a role}} in the development of the nervous system. Recently, expression of EphA 4 in the developing cochlea was shown, with strong expression in cells lining the osseous <b>spiral</b> <b>lamina</b> (OSL) through which afferent dendrites must pass to reach the organ of Corti (OC). It was also demonstrated that ephrin-B 2 and -B 3, both of which are known to interact with EphA 4, are expressed by spiral ganglion (SG) neurons. To investigate the functional role of EphA 4 in the development of inner ear neurons, neonatal rat SG explants were cultured for 72 hours on uniformly coated surfaces or near stripes of EphA 4 /IgG-Fc-chimera. Control explants were cultured on or near IgG-Fc and EphA 1 /IgG-Fc-chimera. To assess the roles of ephrin-B 2 and -B 3 in EphA 4 signaling, SG explants were cultured with or without anti-ephrin-B 2 and/or -B 3 blocking antibodies. Growth patterns of SG neurites at the border of EphA 4 receptor stripes showed repulsion, characterized by turning, stopping and/or reversal. In the case of IgG-Fc and EphA 1, the neurites grew straight onto the stripes. Treatment with either anti-ephrin-B 2 or -B 3 blocking antibodies significantly reduced the repulsive effect of an EphA 4 stripe. Moreover, when both antibodies were used together, neurites crossed onto EphA 4 stripes with no evidence of repulsion. The results suggest that EphA 4 provides repulsive signals to SG neurites in the developing cochlea, and that ephrin-B 2 and -B 3 together mediate this response...|$|E
