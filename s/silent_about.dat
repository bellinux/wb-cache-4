5|$|Before the war, Palluth, a {{lecturer}} in the 1929 secret Poznań University cryptology course, had been co-owner of AVA, which produced equipment for the Cipher Bureau, and knew many details of the decryption technology. In Warsaw, under German occupation, other Cipher Bureau workers were interrogated by German intelligence commissions, and some AVA workers were approached by German agents, but all kept <b>silent</b> <b>about</b> compromises to Enigma.|$|E
5|$|Potthast later {{married and}} took on her husband's name. Her son {{struggled}} with ailments {{throughout his life}} and stayed with her; her daughter became a physician. In a 1987 interview with former Der Spiegel editor Peter-Ferdinand Koch, Potthast remained <b>silent</b> <b>about</b> Himmler's responsibility for Nazi war crimes. She died in 1997, aged 85, in Baden-Baden, Baden-Württemberg.|$|E

5|$|The Twittys {{and their}} {{supporters}} criticized a perceived lack of progress by Aruban police. The Twittys' own actions in Aruba were also criticized, and the Twittys were accused of actively stifling any evidence that might impugn Holloway's character by asking her fellow students to remain <b>silent</b> <b>about</b> the case and using their access to the media to push {{their own version of}} events. The Twittys denied this.|$|E
5|$|There {{was some}} {{speculation}} that the player used by the utility's author to obtain keys would be revoked. Cyberlink, which sells the PowerDVD player software, was quick to deny that its software {{could be used to}} obtain keys. Corel was <b>silent</b> <b>about</b> the role its WinDVD software had played in the leaking of volume and title keys. Both companies have since released updates for their player software.|$|E
5|$|Although many Pakistanis were <b>silent</b> <b>about</b> the {{operation}} against Lal Masjid, most {{agreed with the}} government's decision {{to use force to}} retake the complex. While hardliners have been able to stir up anger every time Musharraf moves against militants, most people have been tolerant and oppose the militants desire to impose their interpretation of Islamic law. Most residents of Islamabad agree that the raid restored local peace, despite fears of retaliation.|$|E

5|$|Endeavour then resumed her voyage westward {{along the}} coast, picking {{a path through}} {{intermittent}} shoals and reefs {{with the help of}} the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth. By 26 August she was out of sight of land, and had entered the open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606. To keep Endeavours voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain <b>silent</b> <b>about</b> where they had been.|$|E
5|$|Pincher, however, {{argued that}} as {{homosexual}} acts were criminal offences in Britain until 1967, Driberg was still vulnerable to blackmail, although he also {{claimed that the}} MI5 connection secured Driberg a lifelong immunity from prosecution. Driberg's colleague Michael Foot denied Pincher's claim that Margaret Thatcher, when prime minister, had made a secret agreement with Foot to protect Driberg if Foot, in turn, would remain <b>silent</b> <b>about</b> the supposed treachery of Roger Hollis, another of Pincher's recently dead targets.|$|E
5|$|The general's objectivity, however, {{has often}} been questioned. Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack of objectivity and impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge against people he had come into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying <b>silent</b> <b>about</b> the more questionable deeds of people he had a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E

5|$|Ammianus is <b>silent</b> <b>about</b> archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was an arm that evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are unsuitable for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks {{did not know how}} to use bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other parts of his account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Francesca Tinti {{has arrived}} at a {{different}} conclusion, arguing instead that Hemming's work, {{more so than the}} Liber Wigorniensis, came to serve very real needs, and that these specifically concerned the monastic community at Worcester. Although the Prefatio is <b>silent</b> <b>about</b> monks, the Enucleatio is explicit that Bishop Wulfstan had commissioned the work to defend the estates assigned for the sustenance of the monks (ad victum monachorum). She relates these concerns to the rapid growth of the community during Bishop Wulfstan's episcopate {{in the second half of}} the 11th century. The coming of the Norman newcomer, Samson, who had been involved in the dissolution of Westbury-on-Trym, would have given the enlarged community a particular incentive to safeguard its property and rights.|$|E

25|$|Religious othering is a {{major theme}} in 1Q84, as Murakami places sacred ideas as {{existing}} separately from everyday reality. This separation, is often cited as emphasizing Murakami’s view of religion as a negative force, which lies in opposition to normal, everyday life; however Murakami is quite <b>silent</b> <b>about</b> his personal religious beliefs.|$|E
25|$|During her {{childhood}} {{it was thought}} that the alleged unmarried affair with Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson must be kept secret.

Sandemo herself doesn't like talking about her ancestry in public.|$|E
