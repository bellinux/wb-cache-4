40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of the influence of fuel injector opening pressure on the dynamic injection timing in diesel engines. The results of the analysis are applied for an IDI (Indirect Injection) diesel engine for which experiments were conducted in the laboratory of the authors. It is revealed that the value of injector opening pressure has a considerable effect on the injection delay, which depends on the volume of the connecting pipeline and the pump cam design. The experimental results are combined with a simulation model of the entire engine in order to derive the actual injection timing (dynamic) and thus the injection delay, since a time reference for the measured fuel pressure diagram does not exist. When this is accomplished, the actual injection timing of the engine can be determined based on the <b>static</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing.</b> Also one can then distinguish the effect of nozzle opening pressure on engine behaviour, since the effect of the varied timing has been eliminated...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study is conducted {{to evaluate the}} use of JP- 8 aviation fuel as a full substitute for diesel fuel in a Ricardo E- 6 high-speed naturally-aspirated four-stroke experimental engine having a swirl combustion chamber. The study covers a wide range of engine load and speed operating conditions, comprising measurements of cylinder pressure diagrams, high-pressure fuel pipe pressures, exhaust gas temperatures, fuel consumptions, exhaust smokiness and exhaust gas emissions (nitrogen oxides, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide). Processing of the measurements provides important performance parameters such as maximum combustion pressure, dynamic injection timing, ignition delay, combustion irregularity and knocking tendency. The differences in the measured performance and exhaust emission parameters are determined for engine operation with JP- 8 fuel, against baseline engine operation using diesel fuel. The study shows that the exhaust emission levels are not much different for operation with the two fuels. On the contrary, operation with JP- 8 fuel increases combustion pressures, combustion intensity and irregularity. This is caused mainly by high pressure fluctuations present in the fuel injection system due to the different physical properties of JP- 8 fuel (compared to diesel fuel), which totally change the injection characteristics. Retardation of the <b>static</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> is one means of improving this situation, while using the same fuel injection equipment. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|An {{ignition}} delay {{is a very}} complex process which depends on a great number of parameters. In practice, definition of the {{ignition delay}} is based on the use of correlation expressions. However, the correlation expressions have very often limited application field. This paper presents a new correlation which has been developed during the research project on the direct injection M-type diesel engine using both the diesel and biodiesel fuel, as well as different values of a <b>static</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing.</b> A dynamic start of injection, as well as the ignition delay, is defined in two ways. The first approach is based on measurement of a needle lift, while the second is based on measurement of a fuel pressure before the injector. The latter approach requires calculation of pressure signals delay through the fuel injection system and the variation of a static advance injection angle changing. The start of a combustion {{and the end of the}} ignition delay is defined on the basis of measurements of an in-cylinder pressure and its point of separation from a skip-fire pressure trace. The developed correlation gives better prediction of the ignition delay definition for the M-type direct injection diesel engine in the case of diesel and biodiesel fuel use when compared with the classic expression by the other authors available in the literature...|$|E

Additionally, to get knowledge of the effect of <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> on particle size distributions in PPC mode, measurements were performed in <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> sweeps at engine speeds 800 rpm and 1600 rpm. Results show that, without EGR, throughout the <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> from very early to late injection, a unimodal particle size distribution dominated by nucleation mode particles can be observed. Adding EGR, similar unimodal particle size distributions are obtained for early <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> whereas bimodal size distributions appear for late <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> when injecting goes into the bowl. The corresponding accumulation mode particle number rapidly increases and results in a high engine-out soot output. In PPC mode with high fuel stratification, a similar trend is found at engine speeds 800 rpm and 1600 rpm during <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> sweeps. Retarding <b>injection</b> is generally found to reduce particle numbers in nucleation mode and increase numbers in accumulation mode, which leads to a higher soot mass output despite of a reduction in total particle numbers.

40|$|Societal {{concerns}} on combustion-based {{fuel consumption}} are ever-increasing. With respect to internal combustion engines, this translates to {{a need to}} increase brake fuel conversion efficiency (BFCE). Diesel engines are a relatively efficient internal combustion engine to consider for numerous applications, but associated actions to mitigate certain exhaust emissions have generally deteriorated engine efficiency. Conventionally, diesel engine emission control has centered on in-cylinder techniques. Although these continue to hold promise, the industry trend is presently favoring the use of after-treatment devices which create new opportunities to improve the diesel engine's brake fuel conversion efficiency. This study focuses on <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> effects on the combustion processes, engine efficiency, and the engine system's responses. The engine in the study is a medium duty diesel engine (capable of meeting US EPA Tier III off road emission standards) equipped with common rail direct fuel injection, variable geometry turbo charging, and interfaced with a custom built engine controller. The study found that <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> greatly affected BFCE by changing the combustion phasing. BFCE would increase up to a maximum then begin to decrease as phasing became less favorable. Combustion phasing would change from being mostly mixing controlled combustion to premixed combustion as <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> would advance allowing more time for fuel to mix during the ignition delay. Combustion phasing, in turn, would influence many other engine parameters. As <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> is advanced, in-cylinder temperatures and pressures amplify, and intake and exhaust manifold pressures deteriorate. Rate of heat release and rate of heat transfer increase when <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> is advanced. Turbocharger speed falls with the advancing <b>injection</b> <b>timing.</b> Torque, however, rose to a maximum then fell off again even though engine speed and fueling rate were held constant between different <b>injection</b> <b>timings.</b> Interestingly, the coefficient of heat transfer changes from a two peak curve to a smooth one peak curve as the <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> is advanced further. The major conclusion {{of the study is}} that injection advance both positively and negatively influences the diesel engine's response which contributes to the brake fuel conversion efficiency...|$|R

The effects of coolant temperature, the charge motion control valve, spark timing and rail pressure were tested through holding all other variables constant and sweeping through different <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> to observe the effect on emissions and power output. A new fuel system was designed to allow for the quick testing of different ethanol blends. The system allowed for comparison testing of an 85 % ethanol blend to UTG 91 as a function of coolant temperature and <b>injection</b> <b>timing.</b> Measurement of cylinder pressure and hydrocarbon emissions near the exhaust valve allowed for a better understanding of engine operation and the effect of using high ethanol content fuels. Initial testing was also done on 15 % and 40 % ethanol blends. The results revealed that engine emissions decrease as a function of reduced loading and higher engine temperatures. Sweeps of <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> for all fuels demonstrated high hydrocarbon emissions for earlier <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> which fell as <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> was retarded. A secondary peak was observed in hydrocarbon emissions for an <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> of approximately 150 CAD aTDC intake. Analysis of rate of fuel injection vs. indicated power revealed a steady decrease in indicated efficiency as <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> was retarded up to 120 CAD aTDC Intake and then a slow rise in efficiency as the timing was further retarded. The exact causes of the decrease in engine efficiency are unknown; however, possible explanations involve increased heat transfer from the cylinder and piston, fuel loss, and inefficient combustion due to impingement on cold surfaces. by Ronald Tharp.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} {{on the effects}} of fuel properties and <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> is required to improve the performance of advanced engines based on low temperature combustion concepts. In this work, an experimental and computational study was conducted to investigate the effects of physical and chemical kinetic properties of low octane fuels and their surrogates in partially premixed compression ignition (PPCI) engines. The main objective was to identify the relative importance of physical versus chemical kinetic properties in predicting practical fuel combustion behavior across a range of <b>injection</b> <b>timings.</b> Two fuel/surrogate pairs were chosen for comparison: light naphtha (LN) versus the primary reference fuel (PRF) with research octane number of 65 (PRF 65), and FACE (fuels for advanced combustion engines) I gasoline versus PRF 70. Two sets of parametric studies were conducted: the first varied the amount of injected fuel mass at different <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> to match a fixed combustion phasing, and the second maintained the same injected fuel mass at each <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> to assess resulting combustion phasing changes. Full-cycle computational fluid dynamic engine simulations were conducted by accounting for differences in the physical properties of the original and surrogate fuels, while employing identical chemical kinetics. The simulations were found to capture trends observed in the experiments, while providing details on spatial mixing and chemical reactivity for different fuels and <b>injection</b> <b>timings.</b> It was found that differences in physical properties become increasingly important as <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> was progressively delayed from premixed conditions, and this was rationalized by analysis of mixture stratification patterns resulting from injection of fuels with different physical properties. The results suggest that accurate descriptions of both physical and chemical behavior of fuels are critical in predictive simulations of PPCI engines {{for a wide range of}} <b>injection</b> <b>timings...</b>|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for fossil fuels and environmental threat due to pollution a number {{renewable sources of energy}} have been studied worldwide. In the present investigation influence of <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> on the performance and emissions of a single cylinder, four stroke stationary, variable compression ratio, diesel engine was studied using waste cooking oil (WCO) as the biodiesel blended with diesel. The tests were performed at three different <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> (24 Â°, 27 Â°, 30 Â° CA BTDC) by changing the thickness of the advance shim. The experimental results showed that brake thermal efficiency for the advanced as well as the retarded <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> was lesser than that for the normal <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> (27 Â° BTDC) for all sets of compression ratios. Smoke, un-burnt hydrocarbon (UBHC) emissions were reduced for advanced <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> where as NOx emissions increased. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) was used to predict the engine performance and emission characteristics of the engine. Separate models were developed for performance parameters as well as emission characteristics. To train the network, compression ratio, <b>injection</b> <b>timing,</b> blend percentage, percentage load, were used as the input parameters where as engine performance parameters like brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific energy consumption (BSEC), exhaust gas temperature (Texh) were used as the output parameters for the performance model and engine exhaust emissions such as NOx, smoke and (UBHC) values were used as the output parameters for the emission model. ANN results showed that there is a good correlation between the ANN predicted values and the experimental values for various engine performance parameters and exhaust emission characteristics and the relative mean error values (MRE) were within 8 %, which is acceptable. <b>Injection</b> <b>timing</b> Waste cooking oil Transesterification Artificial Neural Network...|$|R

The experimental results show that with the rail pressure increasing, fuel economy and smoke are improving, while NOx is deteriorating. However, as rail pressure very high, the improving trends of smoke and fuel economy are not obvious terribly, and even at low load condition, the economy will decline instead. With <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> delayed, NOx is reducing while smoke and fuel economy are augmenting at the conditions of high load. However, at the low load conditions, with <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> lagging, smoke and NOx will decline simultaneously...|$|R

Thus A 20 can be effectively used in a diesel engine without any modification. Compression ratio of 19. 5 along with <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> of 30 °bTDC (before top dead centre) will give better performance and lower emission which is very close to diesel. Comparison of performance and emission was done for different values of compression ratio along with <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> to find best possible combination for operating engine with A 20. It is found that the combined increase of compression ratio and <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> increases the BTE and reduces SFC while having lower emissions.
