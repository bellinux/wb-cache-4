Research on the differences in pod <b>shattering</b> <b>resistance</b> levels of various rapeseed varieties can provide a theoretical basis for varietal breeding and application in mechanical harvesting. The indicators on pod <b>shattering</b> <b>resistance</b> including pod morphology and wall components were evaluated on eight hybrids and open pollinators, respectively, during 2012 - 2014.

This illustrated that pod wall weight and the water content in pod walls determined the SRI. (3) Compared with the relative contents of biochemical components in pod walls, the contents of particular biochemical components in pod walls had closer correlations with SRI.

The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the resistance of soybean genotypes to pod shattering as affected by agronomical and morphological characters. The field study was conducted in Malang, Indonesia, using 150 soybean genotypes. Data were collected on agronomical traits, the percentage of pod shattering, and pod morphological traits. Identification for <b>shattering</b> <b>resistance</b> was done as per oven dry method. Percentage of pod shattering was ranged from 0 % up to 100 % shattering with a mean of 58. 11 %. Pod shattering was found to be negatively correlated with a number of pod per plant, the thickness of the pod, and Y/Z (seed weight and pod weight ratio). The Identification obtained 66 very highly susceptible genotypes, 19 susceptible genotypes, 19 moderate genotypes, 38 resistant genotypes, and 8 very resistant genotypes.

5000|$|The armor-piercing concept {{calls for}} more {{penetration}} capability than the target's armor thickness. Generally, the penetration capability of an armor-piercing round increases with the projectile's kinetic energy and also with concentration of that energy in a small area. Thus, an efficient means of achieving increased penetrating power is increased velocity for the projectile. However, projectile impact against armor at higher velocity causes greater levels of shock. Materials have characteristic maximum levels of shock capacity, beyond which they may shatter, or otherwise disintegrate. At relatively high impact velocities, steel {{is no longer an}} adequate material for armor-piercing rounds. Tungsten and tungsten alloys are suitable for use in even higher-velocity armor-piercing rounds, due to their very high shock tolerance and <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance,</b> and to their high melting and boiling temperatures. They also have very high density. Energy is concentrated by using a reduced-diameter tungsten shot, surrounded by a lightweight outer carrier, the sabot (a French word for a wooden shoe). This combination allows the firing of a smaller diameter (thus lower mass/aerodynamic resistance/penetration resistance) projectile with a larger area of expanding-propellant [...] "push", thus a greater propelling force and resulting kinetic energy.|$|E

The domesticated {{common bean}} (Phaseolus vulgaris) {{originated}} in the Mesoamerican and Andean regions independently. Similar to other legume crops, the reduction of pod shattering represents a key domestication syndrome in the domesticated common bean. Understanding the genetic variation of common bean in relation to pod shattering is important for elucidating the underlying genetic mechanisms of parallel evolution (Don and Wang, 2015) and also because this will provide breeders with key tools to improve this trait, thus reducing yield loss (Santalla et al., 2004). Most of these {{studies have been conducted}} in cereals (Lin et al., 2012), while in legumes, the identification of pod-shattering genes lag far behind those of the cereal crops (Li and Olsen, 2016). In this study, we identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling pod fiber in the ventral suture (string) and pod shattering in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between a cultivated common bean and wild nuña bean. F 2 : 7 flines were grown under short-day conditions and pod string and pod shattering were analysed at several developmental stages. Correlation analysis showed positive relationship among pod string and shattering. Multi-environment QTL mapping revealed that a major QTL on linkage group 2 (LG 02) controlled pod string and co-localized to pod shattering. In addition, minor QTLs related to pod string and pod shattering were identified on LGs 01, 03, 04 and 07. Genes underlying the pleiotropic QTL regions could be potential targets for improving <b>shattering</b> <b>resistance</b> performance through marker assisted selection.

To identify loci underlying <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance,</b> we used a novel genotyping-by-sequencing approach DArT-Seq.

A set of 83 accessions of B. carinata, collected from the Australian Grains Genebank, was evaluated for pod <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance</b> based on pod rupture energy (RE). In comparison to B. napus (RE = 2. 16 mJ), B. carinata accessions had higher RE values (2. 53 to 20. 82 mJ). A genetic linkage map of an F 2 population from two contrasting B. carinata selections, BC 73526 (shatter resistant with high RE) and BC 73524 (shatter prone with low RE) comprising 300 individuals, was constructed using a set of 6, 464 high quality DArTseq markers and subsequently used for QTL analysis.

40|$|Shattering is a {{major problem}} in canola {{production}} worldwide and especially in Australia because the crop matures in summer under hot and windy condition. Little variation for <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance</b> is available in Brassica napus, which is the major canola species. Considerable variation for <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance</b> is available in B. rapa, which is a relatively minor oilseed species. <b>Shatter</b> <b>resistance</b> is being transferred from B. rapa into B. napus by backcrossing. Screening for <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance</b> in canola breeding programs is currently based on mechanical tests of individual siliqua strength. The test, which is time consuming, can only take place with completely dry and mature siliquae. This study aimed to identify molecular markers linked to <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance</b> in a population segregating for this trait, and to develop specific and robust primers to be used in a routine test, for screening for <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance</b> in canola breeding programs. Crosses were made between the shatter-susceptible Canadian cv. Torch of B. rapa L. ssp. oleifera (Metzg.) Sinsk and a shatter-resistant Indian line, DS- 17 -D of B. rapa L. ssp. oleifera var. Brown Sarson (Singh) Prakash. <b>Shatter</b> <b>resistance</b> was found to be a recessive trait controlled by two major genes, designated sh 1 and sh 2. The phenotypic segregation in the F 3 population of this cross fitted a Mendelian ratio of 12 : 3 : 1 for shatter-susceptible (S), intermediate-shattering (M) and shatter-resistant (R) respectively. Further evidence from the phenotypic segregation in 19 F 3 families was in agreement with the FZ ratio of 12 : 3 : 1. Bulked segregant analysis coupled with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was applied to both F, and F 3 populations of the cross. Three RAPD markers, designated RAC- 3, RX- 7 and SAC- 20, were identified from the F 3 population. RAC- 3 and RX- 7 appeared to be linked in coupling to sh 1 and sh 2 at approximate distances of 13 cM and 20 cM respectively, whereas SAC- 20 appeared to be linked in repulsion to both of these alleles at approximately 20 cM. The linkage of SAC- 20 to both loci supported a theory of chromosome duplication during evolution of the B. rapa genome. Three pairs of sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) primers designated SCAC- 3, SCX- 7 and SCAC- 20, 21 to 24 bp in length were designed based on the sequences of RAPD markers RAC- 3, RX- 7 and SAC- 20 respectively. Only the SCX- 7 primer produced polymorphic markers corresponding to RX- 7 amplified from 'shatter-resistant' DNA individuals, while SCAC- 3 and SCAC- 20 produced amplified products corresponding to RAC- 3 and SAC- 20 to both shatter-resistant and shatter-susceptible DNA individuals. SCAR SCX- 7 was subsequently tested with other Brassica populations including B. napus and BC,F, of B. napus introgressed with B. rapa to investigate the presence of the sh 2 gene. All lines from the backcross populations possessed the expected SCX- 7 marker {{with the exception of one}} line where the marker was absent. This indicated that shatter-resistant gene sh 2 was present in all these populations except for the one line. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E

40|$|Canola is an {{important}} oilseed crop in Australia. Lack of genetic variation in canola for economically important traits hampers efforts to breed for elite lines competitive on the world markets. An alternative approach for improvement of canola is to tap the genetic variation present in the progenitor species of B. napus and transfer novel genes into canola lines. In this study, the progenitors of B. napus (B. rapa and B. oleracea) were screened for tolerance to manganese toxicity, <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance</b> and blackleg resistance with the aim to transfer these traits through resynthesis of B. napus. Genotypes of B. rapa displayed the best tolerance to manganese toxicity in a hydroponics sand culture bioassay. The inheritance pattern of tolerance to manganese toxicity in B. rapa strongly suggested {{the presence of a}} single gene control for this trait with incomplete dominance. In the studies to screen for siliqua <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance,</b> increased energy levels of siliqua shatter were observed in B. oleracea genotypes compared to B. napus. To identify molecular markers linked to <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance</b> in B. rapa, a segregating population derived form the cross DS- 17 -D by Torch, was screened using RAPD, ISSR and AFLP techniques. Two AFLP markers were identified that showed strong linkage to <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance.</b> To identify new sources of blackleg resistance, several B. oleracea and B. rapa accessions were screened in field trials. B. oleracea genotypes were more resistant to blackleg showing a high level of survival (30 - 80 %) compared to the genotypes of B. rapa. Interspecific crosses were made between selected genotypes of B. oleracea and B. rapa, and hybrid embryos were rescued using ovary culture. The genotypic profiles of hybrids and the parental lines were ascertained with RAPD primers and flow cytometry. Synthetic B. napus lines were backcrossed to canola to begin the introgression of specific traits of interest into canola germplasm. Preliminary screening of synthetic hybrids derived from interspecific crosses between B. rapa and B. oleracea showed the same degree of manganese tolerance and L. maculans resistance as the resistant parental genotypes. BCi to B. napus retained the transferred resistance and tolerance traits of the synthetic hybrids. The presence of SCX- 7 marker linked to one of the <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance</b> genes sh 2 in the synthetic hybrid SH 2 indicated the successful transfer of <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance</b> from B. rapa as this marker expressed itself in B. rapa genotype Chitose {{which is one of the}} parents of synthetic hybrid SH 2.

Previously published water use/yield production functions for proso millet have slopes lower than reported for other C 4 species in this region. The objectives of this experiment were to determine the water-limited yield relationship for proso millet and to identify environmental factors that cause yields to be lower than predicted by the water limited yield relationship. Water use and yield data were obtained from a long-term crop rotation experiment conducted under dryland conditions in northeast Colorado from 1995 to 2016. Stepwise linear regression {{analysis was used to}} determine important environmental factors influencing yield. The water-limited yield relationship had a slope consistent with other C 4 species in this region (32. 57 kg ha− 1 per mm of water use).

Here, we identified and characterized B. napus LATE FLOWERING (BnLATE), which encodes a Cys 2 /His 2 -type zinc-finger protein. Heterologous expression of BnLATE under the double enhanced CaMV 35 S promoter (D 35 S) in wild-type Arabidopsis plants resulted in a marked decrease in lignification in the replum, valve layer (carpel) and dehiscence zone. pBnLATE::GUS activity was strong in the yellowing silique walls of transgenic lines. Furthermore, the expression pattern of BnLATE and the lignin content gradient in the silique walls at 48 days after pollination (DAP) of 73290, a B. napus silique shattering-resistant line, are similar to those in transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing BnLATE. Transcriptome sequencing of the silique walls revealed that genes encoding peroxidases, which polymerize monolignols and lignin in the phenylpropanoid pathway, were down-regulated at least two-fold change in the D 35 S::BnLATE transgenic lines. pBnLATE::BnLATE transgenic lines were further used to identify the function of BnLATE, and the results showed that lignification in the carpel and dehiscence zone of yellowing silique also remarkably decreased compared with the wild-type control, the silique shattering-resistance and expression pattern of peroxidase genes are very similar to results with D 35 S::BnLATE. These results suggest that BnLATE is a negative regulator of lignin biosynthesis in the yellowing silique walls, and promotes silique-shattering resistance in B. napus through restraining the polymerization of monolignols and lignin...|$|R
40|$|Seed {{shattering}} is {{a common}} problem in early soybean production system (ESPS) in the Midsouth, which mainly uses maturity group (MG) IV soybeans. Many {{studies have been conducted}} on the genetics of soybean <b>shattering</b> <b>resistance</b> for individual varieties; however, information on the physiology of soybean shattering pattern under specific environmental conditions, which is often critical to soybean growers, is very limited. Field experiments were conducted at Stoneville MS from 2007 to 2009 to investigate the shattering patterns of 80 - 132 MG IV soybean varieties each year. Results from 2007 and 2008 indicated that, when April-planted MG IV soybeans matured in mid- to late August, pods of most soybean varieties did not shatter within the first three weeks after maturity (WAM) and there was no significant shattering effect on final yields. However, differences in pod shattering among the varieties became apparent in the fourth WAM. Late-planted MG IV soybeans, which matured in early September, had a low shattering rate and could hold seeds up to 6 WAM before reaching a critical shattering point. Most soybean varieties planted in April 2009 did not show significant pod shattering {{by the end of the}} fourth WAM. The critical point of shattering was not reached until 6 - 7 WAM. Relatively lower temperatures and abundant rainfall during the late growing season in 2009 may be the main reasons causing delayed shattering in April-planted MG IV soybeans. Results from the May-planting of 2007 and the April-planting of 2009 indicated that soybeans maturing after September have much less problematic shattering. Different weather patterns, especially temperature and rainfall in each year could be essential factors affecting seed shattering patterns...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) are {{an important}} class of genetic marker for target gene mapping. As of yet, there is no rapid and effective method to identify SNPs linked with agronomic traits in rapeseed and other crop species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrate a novel method for identifying SNP markers in rapeseed by deep sequencing a representative library and performing bulk segregant analysis. With this method, SNPs associated with rapeseed pod shatter-resistance were discovered. Firstly, a reduced representation of the rapeseed genome was used. Genomic fragments ranging from 450 - 550 bp were prepared from the susceptible bulk (ten F 2 plants with the silique <b>shattering</b> <b>resistance</b> index, SSRI 0. 90), and also Solexa sequencing-produced 90 bp reads. Approximately 50 million of these sequence reads were assembled into contigs {{to a depth of}} 20 -fold coverage. Secondly, 60, 396 'simple SNPs' were identified, and the statistical significance was evaluated using Fisher's exact test. There were 70 associated SNPs whose -log(10) p value over 16 were selected to be further analyzed. The distribution of these SNPs appeared a tight cluster, which consisted of 14 associated SNPs within a 396 kb region on chromosome A 09. Our evidence indicates that this region contains a major quantitative trait locus (QTL). Finally, two associated SNPs from this region were mapped on a major QTL region. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: 70 associated SNPs were discovered and a major QTL for rapeseed pod shatter-resistance was found on chromosome A 09 using our novel method. The associated SNP markers were used for mapping of the QTL, and may be useful for improving pod shatter-resistance in rapeseed through marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning. This approach will accelerate the discovery of major QTLs and the cloning of functional genes for important agronomic traits in rapeseed and other crop species...|$|R
40|$|The {{genetic control}} of pod {{dehiscence}} was studied through the production, field trial and subsequent {{analysis of a}} full diallel involving seven parents selected for high and low resistance to pod shattering. Additive gene effects were most significant among the measures of pod shattering resistance with only minor contributions from non-additive gene effects. Genetic variation in measures of the stiffness of the pod wall were, however, determined by dominant gene effects. Genes for increased pod shattering resistance acted recessively. All characters showed high levels of heritability. Correlations among pod <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance</b> characters and other pod, raceme and plant characters were low suggesting that resistance {{is likely to be}} independent of other important agronomic traits...|$|E
40|$|Pre-harvest pod-shattering in Brassica napus (Oilseed Rape) is {{a serious}} {{agricultural}} and economic problem, with losses of 11 - 25 % reported (Price et al., 1996) resulting in lost revenues of an estimated £ 66 million per annum for the U. K. alone. Reductions in this loss will provide benefits for both society and the environment. Lines from a doubled haploid B. napus mapping population, segregating for Pod <b>Shatter</b> <b>Resistance</b> (PSR), termed POSH 1 - 3 exhibited a range of <b>shatter</b> <b>resistance</b> phenotypes. A Random Impact Test (RIT) {{was used to measure}} the difference between levels of PSR in population lines. An assessment of pod physiology among these lines revealed that PSR is associated with increases in the amount of vasculature and changes in vascular orientation as reported in the resistant DK 142 parent line (Child et al. 2003). PSR was also found to result from differences in degradation of a key tissue required for valve separation in both B. napus and Arabidopsis. A genetic linkage map has been produced for the population and includes a number of candidate gene markers with established roles in fruit development in Arabidopsis. The linkage map was used as a basis to perform a QTL analysis where a number of loci associated with increases in PSR in B. napus have been identified. Genetic markers linked to these loci could provide a valuable tool for marker assisted selection (MAS) to improve pre-harvest pod shatter in B. napus. A novel assay has also been developed to investigate differences in PSR between Arabidopsis ecotypes. Shatter resistant ecotypes have been identified within the accessions tested. This could enable the differences between the model and crop species to be compared to assess if factors regulating such traits are conserved. This may also provide insight into new candidates to modulate preharvest pod shatter for agronomic improvement of Brassica species...|$|E

40|$|Seed {{shattering}} in crops {{is a key}} domestication trait due to {{its relevance}} for seed dispersal, yield, and fundamental questions in evolution (e. g., convergent evolution). Here, we focused on pod shattering in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the most important legume crop for human consuption in the world. With this main aim, we developed a methodological pipeline that comprises a thorough characterization under field conditions, including also the chemical composition and histological analysis of the pod valves. The pipeline was developed {{based on the assumption}} that the shattering trait itself can be treated in principle as a “syndrome” (i. e., a set of correlated different traits) at the pod level. We characterized a population of 267 introgression lines that were developed ad-hoc to study shattering in common bean. Three main objectives were sought: (1) to dissect the shattering trait into its “components,” of level (percentage of shattering pods per plant) and mode (percentage of pods with twisting or non-twisting valves); (2) to test whether shattering is associated to the chemical composition and/or the histological characteristics of the pod valves; and (3) to test the associations between shattering and other plant traits. We can conclude the following: Very high shattering levels can be achieved in different modes; <b>shattering</b> <b>resistance</b> is mainly a qualitative trait; and high shattering levels is correlated with high carbon and lignin contents of the pod valves and with specific histological charaterstics of the ventral sheath and the inner fibrous layer of the pod wall. Our data also suggest that shattering comes with a “cost,” as it is associated with lowpod size, low seed weight per pod, high pod weight, and low seed to pod-valves ratio; indeed, it can be more exaustively described as a syndrome at the pod level. Our work suggests that the valve chemical composition (i. e., carbon and lignin content) can be used for a high troughput phenotyping procedures for shattering phenotyping. Finally, we believe that the application of our pipeline will greatly facilitate comparative studies among legume crops, and gene tagging...|$|R
