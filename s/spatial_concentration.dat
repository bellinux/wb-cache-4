Fears that segregation and <b>spatial</b> <b>concentrations</b> of poor and minority ethnic households will negatively impact the individuals living in such concentrations seem to be based largely on the American literature. Fears about the formation of ghettos and the negative image of living in one are transmitted to Europe, where they are picked up by politicians and policy makers. In light of such fears, policy makers seek to create mixed urban neighbourhoods. Their reasoning is logical and straightforward: if <b>spatial</b> <b>concentrations</b> of certain population groups have negative effects, then mixed areas would not. The creation of mixed urban neighbourhoods may prevent problems or even have positive effects – for instance, more social cohesion, social contacts between all kinds of groups or better chances for social mobility (Arthurson, 2012; Van Kempen & Bolt, 2012) [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Dpp is {{a classic}} morphogen, which means that it is present in a <b>spatial</b> <b>concentration</b> {{gradient}} in the tissues where it is found, and its presence as a gradient gives it functional meaning in how it affects development. The most studied tissue in which Dpp is found is the wing. In the wing, Dpp is strongly expressed in a narrow stripe of cells {{down the middle of}} the wing where the tissue marks the border between the anterior and posterior sides.

50|$|Others {{are skeptical}} of {{concentrated}} poverty from public housing being {{the cause of}} social pathologies, arguing that such a characterization is a simplification of a much more complex set of social phenomena (Crump 2002). According to Crump (2002), the term “concentrated poverty” was originally a spatial concept {{that was part of}} a much broader and complex sociological description of poverty, but the spatial component then became the overarching metaphor for concentrated poverty and the cause of social pathologies surrounding it. Instead of <b>spatial</b> <b>concentration</b> simply being a part of the broad description of social pathologies, Crump (2002) argues that the concept replaced the broad description, mistakenly narrowing the focus to the physical concentration of poverty.|$|E
50|$|In the fly wing, the {{posterior}} and anterior {{halves of the}} tissue are populated by different kinds of cells that express different genes. Cells in {{the posterior}} but not the anterior express the transcription factor Engrailed (En). One of the genes activated by En is hedgehog (hh), a signaling factor. Hedgehog signaling instructs neighboring cells to express Dpp, but Dpp expression is also repressed by En. The result is that Dpp is only produced in a narrow stripe of cells immediately adjacent to but not within the posterior half of the tissue. Dpp produced at this anterior/posterior border then diffuses out {{to the edges of}} the tissue, forming a <b>spatial</b> <b>concentration</b> gradient.|$|E

40|$|Public {{agencies}} typically collect statistical databases on population, housing, {{economic activities}} {{and various other}} indicators. In their existing form, these databases cannot be directly adopted for planning and policy formulation, as {{they need to be}} tailored to the issue for which information is required. The specific problem addressed in this article is how to process and visualise small-area data, in our case referring to the Dutch 6 -digit postcode, to provide detailed information for areas that are normally difficult to target in policy terms because they do not relate to the identifiable administrative entities that planners and politicians are accustomed to. Therefore a methodology is presented that identifies <b>spatial</b> <b>concentrations</b> based on the underlying data using geographical information systems (GIS). Emphasis is placed on the technical characteristics of this method, which has been applied in a number of urban studies, and on the advantages and disadvantages for further utilisation. Using the Amsterdam City Monitor as a case study, this paper illustrates how to produce detailed maps of urban dynamics within a city to support local policy and planning. It also shows that the presented method of mapping <b>spatial</b> <b>concentrations</b> can be applied to a variety of urban issues, and complements the common practice of using intensity classes to compare places...|$|R

50|$|In {{an ideal}} world, the <b>spatial</b> <b>concentration</b> of {{particles}} within the SSZ would remain constant throughout solidification. As it happens, though, {{the concentration of}} particles does change during compression, and this process is highly sensitive to solidification speed. At low freezing rates, Brownian motion takes place, allowing particles to move easily away from the solid-liquid interface and maintain a homogeneous suspension. In this situation, the suspension is always warmer than the solidified portion. At fast solidification speeds, approaching VC, the concentration, and concentration gradient at the solid-liquid interface increases because particles cannot redistribute soon enough. When it has built up enough, the freezing point of the suspension is below the temperature gradient in the solution and morphological instabilities can occur. For situations where the particle concentration bleeds into the diffusion layer, both the actual and freezing temperature dip below the equilibrium freezing temperature creating an unstable system. Often, these situations lead {{to the formation of}} what are known as ice lenses.|$|E
50|$|It is {{suggested}} that IZ policies may not effectively disperse low-income units throughout the region, which actually contradicts {{the aim of the}} policy itself. For instances in Suffolk County, it is found that there is a <b>spatial</b> <b>concentration</b> of IZ units in poor neighbourhood coupled with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic, which are considered the minorities. Furthermore, 97.7% of the IZ units were built in only 10% of the census tract from 1980 to 2000, which is area with the lowest-income neighbourhood coupled with clustering of minorities. It is indispensable to notice that housing policies is controlled by local government rather than regional government in Suffolk County, therefore without regional coordinations of housing policy, it fails to consider the inter-municipality distribution of low-income household within the county. Besides, density bonuses given to property developers for the provision of IZ units have intensified the concentration of affordable units in poor neighborhood (Ryan & Enderle as cited in Mukhija, Das, Regus et al., 2012). This shows that IZ policies may fail to disperse the low-income distributions when it is carried out without taking regional coordination into account.|$|E

5000|$|Between 1970 and 1990 {{the number}} of people living in high-poverty neighborhoods - where the poverty rate is 40% or higher - doubled. Because the measure was not used in the US census until 1970, the first time trends of poverty {{concentration}} were studied systematically was after the release of the 1980 census. Sociologist William Julius Wilson found that during the 1970s, (1) poverty increased dramatically throughout metropolitan areas of the United States; (2) at the same time, {{the number of}} poor people residing within these areas increased; and (3) this exacerbation of poverty conditions occurred primarily within African American neighborhoods. Several scholars would go on to affirm that in the 1970s America saw a dramatic {{increase in the number of}} neighborhoods that classified as areas of concentrated poverty [...] This trend extended to a lesser extent in the 1980s, as the number of neighborhoods qualifying as areas of [...] "extreme poverty" [...] continued to increase, but at a slower rate than it had throughout the 1970s. These trends of concentrated poverty at the level of the census tract and neighborhood were similarly reflected at the level of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA's). In both decades between 1970-1990, the differential between the poverty rates of central cities and their suburbs increased, reflecting an increasing <b>spatial</b> <b>concentration</b> of MSA poverty within central cities. [...] This changing spatial distribution of poverty has been attributed to changes in the labor market (deindustrialization, an increasing gap between wages available to skilled and unskilled workers, spatial mismatch between the types of jobs offered in the city and the type of workers residing there), declining economic growth (although several studies have shown a weak or non-existent link between reduction of poverty and urban economic growth in neighborhoods of extreme poverty), the relocation of upper- and middle-income residents from the city to the suburbs, and demographic changes (the rise in one-parent households and decrease in labor market participation). These changes were intertwined with America's history of ethno-racial segregation that produced the ghetto, white flight from American cities, which led to a declining tax base to provide city services, and the civil rights movement, which allowed better-off blacks to leave inner-city areas. Although concentrated poverty increased among blacks, Hispanics, and whites throughout 1970-1990s, increases were far more dramatic among blacks, followed by Hispanics, and then to a much lesser extent whites.|$|E
