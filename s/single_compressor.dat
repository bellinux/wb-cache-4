50|$|This design, {{where no}} air passes {{between the two}} compartments, {{provides}} for more appropriate humidity levels and much tighter temperature control in each compartment. It also requires much less energy to operate, since each compressor & coolant system can be optimized for a specific temperature range. Further, opening the door of one compartment {{does not affect the}} temperature of the air or humidity level in the other compartment. Thus, it avoids many of the disadvantages of the much more common <b>single</b> <b>compressor</b> designs described above, although at a higher initial cost and increased system noise. Manufacturers of such designs argue that the increased cost is compensated over time due to reduced energy use and less food waste due to reduced spoilage.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{focus of}} this {{research}} paper is {{on the development of}} a multi evaporator system (3 evaporators) to maintain the different operating temperature in evaporators with a <b>single</b> <b>compressor,</b> an individual expansion device and an air cooled condenser. The modeling methodology is developed with the multiple objectives of control and design. Firstly, the individual components of this model are developed based on the best published theoretical and empirical literature. This system is used to maintain- 10 ˚C, 0 ˚C and + 10 ˚C in three compartment. An air conditioner compressor of 1. 5 tons is used for the setup purpose. Refrigerant R- 22 is used for system. Multi evaporator systems yields the higher value of coefficient of performance compared to single evaporator system meant for different temperatures. There is easy control of fluctuations in loads by controlling individual evaporator. Also saving in initial cost and space required are the additional advantages with <b>single</b> <b>compressor</b> multi evaporator systems.

40|$|Low {{temperature}} (LT, - 35 °C to - 50 °C) and ultra {{low temperature}} (ULT, - 50 °C to - 100 °C) refrigeration {{is required in}} the life sciences industry for the production and storage of biological systems. The minimum practical storage temperature of a simple, single-stage refrigeration system is - 30 °C, and this is incapable of meeting the requirements of biotechnology applications. Current LT and ULT refrigeration systems utilize cascade systems, which are combinations of single-stage refrigeration systems operating at successively lower temperatures. Because they use multiple compressors, cascade systems have higher capital and operating costs than simple single-stage vapor compression refrigeration systems. Equipment operating costs of LT and ULT refrigeration contribute significantly to the operating costs of biotechnology companies and therefore motivate the development of lower cost, higher performance refrigeration systems. One approach to achieving greater efficiency {{is the development of}} <b>single</b> <b>compressor</b> systems that utilize a refrigerant mixture and a condensing separator. After compression, the refrigerants are separated and follow refrigeration cycles similar in working temperature and pressure to cascade systems to achieve the desired temperature and heat load capacity. The refrigerant mixture streams are combined at the suction side of the compressor and compressed again to complete the cycle. This concept has the benefit of using a <b>single</b> <b>compressor</b> to reach low temperatures rather than the multiple compressors used in cascade systems. This work addresses the modeling, analysis and testing of a <b>single</b> <b>compressor</b> mixed refrigerant system (MRS) for low temperature applications. A model will be developed using first and second law principles of thermodynamics to calculate the refrigeration capacity, power consumption, coefficient of performance (COP), and second law efficiency. The model results will be validated through comparison with experimental results for a prototype system under steady-state conditions. Also, the model results will be explored to determine the impact of mixture composition on the system performance. Performance and benefits of the MRS will be compared to a similar cascade refrigeration system operating under similar conditions. The experimental performance of the prototype MRS will be used to make recommendations to advance the development of more efficient low temperature storage refrigeration systems...|$|E

40|$|<b>Single</b> screw <b>compressors</b> {{are widely}} used in various {{industrial}} fields, however the performance usually drops obviously after thousands of hours of operation due to the wear between the star-wheel and the gate rotor. A lot of meshing pair profiles and manufacturing methods are proposed to solve this problem.

In this paper, the geometric models of the clearances for both profiles, a kind of multi-column profile and single-column profile for oil flooded compressors are carried out, and a mathematical lubrication model is used to analyses the oil lubrication. Results show that the torques caused by the oil film force {{on both sides of}} the star-wheel tooth are unbalanced. The total torques of the analyzed multi-column profile is smaller than that of the single column profile, which indicates a better lubrication condition. The analysis can also be used to optimize the profile design of the meshing pair of <b>single</b> screw <b>compressors.</b> ...|$|R
