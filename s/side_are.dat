5|$|The kerb-stones {{around the}} tomb display some patterning; {{those on the}} {{northern}} <b>side</b> <b>are</b> mostly rectilinear, while those on the southern <b>side</b> <b>are</b> smaller and largely irregular in shape. It is probable {{that there was an}} ancillary dry-stone wall constructed using blocks of ironstone from the geological Folkestone beds, as is evident at Chestnuts Long Barrow. Given that such blocks of stone rarely occur naturally, it may have been quarried.|$|E

5|$|Behind the High Table is a {{portrait}} of Edward II; underneath is a longsword brought to the college in 1902 after being preserved for many years {{on one of the}} college's estates at Swainswick, near Bath.

The other portraits around the hall include other prominent members of Oriel such as Matthew Arnold, Thomas Arnold, James Anthony Froude, John Keble, John Henry Newman, Richard Whately and John Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Externally, {{there are}} slate roofs and coped gables with cross finials. The roofs have {{patterned}} bands of fishscale Whitland Abbey slates, {{except on the}} nave. There are large scale, plain unbuttressed walls without batter for the nave, a nineteenth century south porch, two transepts and a chancel with a nineteenth century addition of a north choir vestry; the dating of the priests' vestry, {{on the north side}} of the chancel, is less certain.

5|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, the anti-de Sitter/conformal {{field theory}} correspondence, sometimes called Maldacena duality or gauge/gravity duality, is a conjectured relationship between {{two kinds of}} physical theories. On one <b>side</b> <b>are</b> anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) which are used in theories of quantum gravity, formulated in terms of string theory or M-theory. On {{the other side of}} the correspondence are conformal field theories (CFT) which are quantum field theories, including theories similar to the Yang–Mills theories that describe elementary particles.|$|E
5|$|On the house's east <b>side</b> <b>are</b> three rooms, whose {{original}} {{presence is}} open to debate. The three rooms are interconnected, another common French colonial element. The room adjacent the porch {{was used as the}} Glidden's dining room and is where the large brick fireplace, which replaced the marble one in 1909, is located. The 1909 fireplace is of the American Craftsman style. At the end of the hall, near the kitchen, there is a full bathroom.|$|E
5|$|St Joseph's Convent is {{a complex}} of 18th- and 19th-century {{buildings}} in Taunton, Somerset, which were primarily used as a Roman Catholic convent, first by the Franciscans, and then Sisters of St. Joseph of Annecy. The buildings were sold out of the Catholic church in 1976, and were redeveloped as residential flats in 2005. The main building is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building, while the boundary walls on the west <b>side</b> <b>are</b> Grade II listed.|$|E

5|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} {{is driven by}} a four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each <b>side</b> <b>are</b> separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.|$|E
5|$|The {{church at}} Llanfaelrhys {{is the only}} one in the United Kingdom {{dedicated}} to Saint Maelrhys, the cousin of both Saint Cadfan and Saint Hywyn, who accompanied them to Wales from Brittany. Legend attributes the building of the church to a trader who landed a cargo of flour near Aberdaron during a famine; he used the profit from his sale to construct a small church for the locals. Much of the building is medieval; the font dates back to the 15th century; and there are plain hard wooden benches on the north side; on the south <b>side</b> <b>are</b> 19th century wooden box pews. The graveyard contains the graves of the three Keating sisters, who restored Plas yn Rhiw.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} Greek flag of {{blue and}} white cross was first hoisted during the Greek War of Independence in March 1822. This was later modified so that the shade of blue matched that of the Bavarian coat of arms of the first King of Greece, Otto. The shield is emblazoned with the coat of arms of the Danish Royal Family, and the supporters on either <b>side</b> <b>are</b> also adapted from the Danish royal arms. Beneath the shield is the motto in Greek, Ἰσχύς μου ἡ αγάπη του λαου ("The people's love is my strength"). Beneath the motto dangles the Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer, Greece's premier decoration of honor.|$|E

Trains are equipped with vending machines for simple refreshments. Garbage is recycled in three categories.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} is of ashlar stone masonry, 25feet (7.6m) high, in the English Baroque style. On {{the south}} side is a slate tablet inscribed with a quotation from the account by Lord Clarendon (1609–1674) in his History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England of the Battle of Lansdowne (1643). On the north <b>side</b> <b>are</b> two poems. On top is a griffin (the crest and supporters of the Grenvilles) holding an escutcheon displaying the Grenville coat of arms: Gules, three clarions or. On another <b>side</b> <b>are</b> shown the Royal Arms of King Charles II (1660–1685) supported by the arms of Sir Bevil's eldest son and heir John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628–1701) and by {{the arms of the}} latter's half first cousin General George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, KG (1608–1670). Monck was the principal figure behind the Restoration of the Monarchy to King Charles II in 1660, in effecting which he was much assisted by Sir John Grenville, for which services both were elevated to the peerage.|$|E
5|$|The scales {{around the}} eye are called circumorbital scales and are named as ocular scales but with {{appropriate}} prefixes. The ocular scale proper is a transparent scale covering the eye {{which is called}} the spectacle, brille or eyecap. The circumorbital scales towards the snout or the front are called preocular scales, those towards the rear are called postocular scales, and those towards the upper or dorsal <b>side</b> <b>are</b> called supraocular scales. Circumorbital scales towards the ventral or lower side, if any, are called subocular scales. Between the preocular and the postnasal scales are one or two scales called loreal scales. Loreal scales are absent in elapids.|$|E

5|$|The valley narrows into {{a canyon}} {{as the road}} begins to climb again, closely hugging the north wall. Four miles (6.4km) east of the city, just past Targert Lake Road, it passes the gates where the road is closed in wintertime. Past this point {{development}} along the road abates {{as most of the}} land alongside the road is part of White River National Forest. On {{the north side of the}} road are some of Aspen's more popular climbing cliffs; on the south <b>side</b> <b>are</b> many small parking areas for trailheads, campgrounds and popular swimming holes along the Roaring Fork like Devil's Punchbowl.|$|E
