40|$|We {{report the}} results of the first {{multisite}} campaign using VLF Doppler receivers to detect whistler mode signals in the south Atlantic originating from VLF transmitters in the northern hemisphere. The signals at 24 and 21. 4 kHz were recorded by a mobile receiver on board the RRS Bransfield during February–March 1993 and an identical system at Faraday, Antarctica. The data show that the output power of plasmaspheric ducts varies with latitude, decreasing with increasing L shell between 1. 6 ≤ L ≤ 2. 7. Using the HOTRAY ray tracing code, we find that the primary cause of the latitudinal variation in duct output power is absorption via cyclotron resonance with energetic electrons in the plasmasphere. The variation is due mainly to the reduction in resonant energy with increasing L shell which brings more particles into resonance with the wave. We demonstrate that ground-based observations of the absorption of whistler mode signals originating from VLF transmitters {{can be used as a}} new way of estimating the energetic electron flux between 1 and 40 keV inside the plasmasphere between 1. 6 ≤ L ≤ 2. 7.

40|$|The {{results of}} our {{research}} have shown that Slovenian middle school students have a weak understanding of mitosis and genetics.

Most of them don’t know that all living beings are made of cells. Moreover, they don’t know that division of cells takes place {{in all of them}} and that this is how gametes are created as well. They do know, however, that living beings inherit certain characteristics.

Genes are frequently equated with characteristics. Students are unaware of the fact that each body cell carries complete hereditary information. The method of classifying images of mitosis phases which we have summarised from the Biology Inquiries (<b>Schields,</b> 2006) proved to be a successful way of learning about mitosis, as the knowledge on this subject matter, along with all chosen fields of genetics, improved significantly after our lesson.

40|$|The concept {{behind the}} Rice Convection Model (RCM) {{dates back to}} an attempt, {{starting}} in the late 1960 s, to mathematize an idea of <b>Schield,</b> Freeman, and Dessler that predicted the pattern of Birkeland currents in Earth 2 ̆ 7 s magnetosphere. The original version of the RCM was an elliptic solver that computed the ionospheric potential distribution by assuming a pattern of ionospheric Hall and Pedersen conductances, including day-night asymmetry and auroral enhancement. Ionospheric potential patterns were mapped along equipotential magnetic field lines to predict magnetosphere flow patterns and plasmasphere shapes. A key milestone was the inclusion, a few years later, of a simple mono-energetic plasma sheet and calculation of field-aligned currents resulting from pressure gradients in the magnetosphere. Results exhibited shielding of the inner magnetosphere from the full effects of magnetospheric convection and also predicted most basic characteristics of region- 2 currents shortly before the currents were identified observationally. By the late 1970 s, the plasma sheet in the RCM had a realistic energy spectrum of both ions and electrons and was exhibiting a number of features that were consistent with observations. Since the 1970 s, the RCM has used time-varying magnetic field models, which further improved consistency with observations. A key discrepancy was the tendency for modeled region- 2 currents to be too narrow in latitude. Another deep difficulty arose in the late 1970 s, when {{we found that the}} observed average magnetic field configuration was inconsistent with the idea of simple sunward adiabatic convection in the plasma sheet (pressure balance inconsistency). A milestone, in the early 1980 s, was the use of modelcalculated electron precipitation from the plasma sheet to produce an approximation of the diffuse aurora and associated ionospheric conductance enhancement. Better prescriptions of plasma sources on the tailward boundary were shown to produce region- 1 and Harang-discontinuity currents flowing on closed field lines. The RCM was adapted to treat interchange-driven transport in the Jovian magnetosphere, and that code was later applied to Saturn. In the late 1990 s and early 2000 s, we mated the RCM with an MHD-friction code, allowing us to keep the magnetic field in force balance with the RCM-computed particle pressure (RCM-E). A change in numerical methods in the early 2000 s made it easy to vary the boundary-condition distribution function in both space and time, allowing investigation of interchange instability for Earth. We present new RCM-E results that include effects of bursty bulk flows as well as first attempts to simulate major discrete auroral features. Initial results suggest that the inclusion of these mesoscale features may help resolve two old conundrums: the pressure-balance inconsistency and latitude distribution of Birkeland currents. We will also address our present code development efforts aimed at including field-aligned electric fields and inertial currents. Forty-five years of work have yielded a numerical model that seems to represent most of the physics involved in large-scale coupling of the inner and middle magnetosphere with the ionosphere...|$|R
40|$|As Graham Pryor {{observed}} in 2012, “Technology has enabled data {{to become the}} prevalent material and currency of research”, replacing information and publications as its accepted deliverable, and presenting significant challenges for academic libraries and information literacy practitioners – though many librarians have built on experience with social science and geospatial datasets in responding to research data agenda. But the data deluge extends beyond academic research, with data also hailed as the new currency and form of exchange in the business world; similarly, in healthcare, education, and the public sector, a philosophy of open data to improve transparency is being espoused by governments {{around the world and}} international bodies such as OECD. The current trend is Big Data 2. 0, which converges e-science with business intelligence, crowdsourcing, data analytics, social media and Web 2. 0 technologies to create very large-scale interdisciplinary human-subject research programs, often involving public- and private-sector partnerships operating across multiple jurisdictions and different cultures. These megaprojects bring another level of technical and organizational complexity to data-intensive research, and raise additional policy, legal, and ethical issues that resonate with the professional and personal values of information specialists. Librarians are extending their information literacy instruction into the research data arena, with many case studies published in the past five years, including initiatives targeting researchers as well as students (Carlson & Bracke, 2015; Doucette & Fyfe, 2013; Haendel et al., 2012; Peters & Vaughn, 2013). Some practitioners have developed curricula to prepare graduates for working with data in employment, notably in business and public health (Macy & Coates, 2016). Public libraries are also helping people navigate the opportunities and threats of the new data landscape (Emmelhain, 2015). Scholars have discussed definitions and competencies for data literacy, usually with reference to research data (Koltay, 2015; Schneider, 2013), although Prado and Marzal’s (2013) framework includes public sector data and targets academic, school, and public librarians. Commentators variously see data literacy as complementary to or a component of information literacy, but agree the concepts are closely related; <b>Schield</b> (2004) argues that statistical literacy is an essential dimension of both data literacy and information literacy. Our research has a broad scope to gain more complete understanding of the evolving phenomenon of data literacy and its meaning for librarians. Three questions guided our investigation: • What {{does it mean to be}} data literate in a world of massive open online data and continuous participatory research programs? • Where should librarians concentrate their efforts to create real value for the individuals and communities they serve? • How can the profession collaborate to make a difference in our fast-moving data-rich society? We used a collective case-study strategy based on secondary data from other related research and our prior work. Our analysis confirms the need for librarians to: expand information and data literacy programs to cover data in multiple contexts (education, the workplace, and our personal lives); assume a critical role in developing policies and practices supporting data privacy; and work across traditional boundaries to promote ethical use of data in the digital world...|$|R
