5|$|By {{the end of}} 2007, Rippy had {{completed}} all of the gameplay music, including end credits, battle themes, and ambient world tracks. In the game's <b>skirmish</b> mode, the music reflects the environment rather than the warring factions. To ensure that {{the character of the}} music changed depending on the environment, he followed self-imposed rules; one environment could feature guitars, but not piano, for instance. To musically unify each world, he added a short introductory piece containing common elements. In contrast with the <b>skirmish</b> mode, the campaign mode contains different recurring melodies for each major character and the human ship Spirit of Fire. Rippy's most intensive work period was January 2008, when he began writing music for the game's cinematics; by this point, he had been working on the score for nine months. Rippy finished the score by February 2008, and, after three months, all tracks were ready to be recorded.|$|E

50|$|From 5 AM on June 16, {{there were}} {{continuous}} <b>skirmishes</b> between Allied and French forces, in which neither side {{managed to get}} an advantage. Some Prussian hussars, cut off from their main body, <b>skirmished</b> with the Red Lancers, but they disengaged after Bijleveld's artillery once again drove the lancers back. Two companies of Nassau infantry advanced towards Frasnes, {{but this time the}} French pushed them back. Some time after 6 AM, after the Prince of Orange arrived, the <b>skirmishes</b> stopped.|$|R
5|$|In the {{campaign}} mode, {{the objective of}} each level is the acquisition of the Portal Gem, usually {{in the possession of}} the heroic guardian of the realm, although it is sometimes in the possession of a rival keeper. Whoever has the Portal Gem must be defeated, so Horny can enter and claim it. The final level involves defeating King Reginald, overlord of the entire realm of Harmonia. Some levels have more specific conditions relating to this goal: for example, there is one level in which the player races against the clock to obtain the Portal Gem in the possession of a rival keeper before the heroes invade and try to do the same. If the heroes recover the Portal Gem, the player loses. Other game modes include My Pet Dungeon and <b>Skirmish.</b> In My Pet Dungeon, the player constructs a dungeon without campaign-style objectives, and can control if, when, and how heroes invade. Instead, there are criteria based on the dungeon composition and related activities, and there is no requirement to proceed to the next level on completion. <b>Skirmish</b> involves competing against computer-controlled rival keepers, and the player can customize conditions such as which rooms and spells are available. Multiplayer is supported over IPX and TCP/IP and is otherwise similar to <b>Skirmish.</b> A patch added elite creatures (stronger than their normal counterparts) to the latter three modes. Elite creatures are attracted by constructing rooms with very specific tile arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Frederick {{thought the}} sounds of the battle were either an outpost <b>skirmish</b> or the Croats, who {{apparently}} started their days with regular firing of their weapons.

5|$|The Battle of Kowloon was a <b>skirmish</b> between British and Chinese vessels off the Kowloon Peninsula, China, on 4 September 1839. Located {{in present-day}} Hong Kong, Kowloon was then {{part of the}} Guangdong province. The <b>skirmish</b> was the first armed {{conflict}} of the First Opium War and occurred when British boats opened fire on Chinese war junks enforcing a food sales embargo on the British community. The embargo was ordered after a local Chinese man died in a drunken brawl with British sailors. The Chinese authorities did not consider the punishment meted out by British officials to be sufficient and as a result, suspended food supplies {{in an attempt to}} force the handover of the culprit. In response, the British summoned nearby warships to force the Chinese to lift the embargo.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of White Marsh or Battle of Edge Hill was {{a battle}} of the Philadelphia {{campaign}} of the American Revolutionary War fought December 5–8, 1777, in the area surrounding Whitemarsh Township, Pennsylvania.

5|$|The scouts were {{pursued by}} the disorganized militia and several were killed. The {{surviving}} scouts arrived at Black Hawk's camp ahead of the militia and reported the events. At the camp, the warriors set up a <b>skirmish</b> line in order {{to fend off the}} pending militia attack. The militia soldiers, intent on pursuing the scouts, chased them back toward the main force of Black Hawk's warriors and their <b>skirmish</b> line. Black Hawk and his force concealed themselves and ambushed the pursuers. Believing that thousands of Sauk and Fox were attacking them, the militia panicked and fled back to the main force camped at Dixon's Ferry. Stillman's exact whereabouts are unknown during this point in the battle. His later account published in a newspaper did not mention his location and noted his only order was to retreat. Stillman's account, published in the Missouri Republican, has been called fanciful.|$|E
