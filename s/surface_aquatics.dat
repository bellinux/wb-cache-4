40|$|International audienceVery few {{tools are}} {{available}} for assessing the im- pact of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) on receiving aquat- ic environments. The main goal {{of the study was}} to assess the ecotoxicological risk of CSOs for a <b>surface</b> <b>aquatic</b> ecosystem using a coupled “substance and bioassay” approach. Wastewater samples from the city of Longueuil, Canada CSO were collected for various rainfall events during one summer season and analyzed for a large panel of substances (n = 116). Fourbioassayswerealsoconductedonrepresenta- tive organisms of <b>surface</b> <b>aquatic</b> systems (Pimephales promelas, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia magna, and Oncorhynchus mykiss). The analytical data did not reveal any ecotoxicological risk for St. Lawrence River organisms, mainly due to strong effluent dilution. However, the substance approach showed that, because of their contribution to the ecotoxicological hazard posed by the effluent, total phospho- rus (Ptot), aluminum (Al), total residual chlorine, chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), pyrene, ammonia (N–NH 4 +), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) require more targeted monitoring. While chronic ecotoxicity tests revealed a potential impact of CSO dis- charges on P. promelas and C. dubia, acute toxicity tests did not show any effect on D. magna or O. mykiss, thus underscoring the importance of chronic toxicity tests as part of efforts aimed at characterizing effluent toxicity. Ultimately, the study leads to the conclusion that the coupled “substance and bioassay” approach is a reliable and robust method for assessing the ecotoxicological risk associated with complex discharges such as CSOs...|$|R

The study investigated 462 km² of the upper part of the Stör catchment, a typical rural lowland catchment located in Northern Germany. The results showed that simulations of nitrate load at monthly increments are better predictors of observed data than daily simulations.

40|$|As {{the climate}} of ancient Mars became colder and drier with time, open bodies of water would have entered a regime in which {{evaporation}} exceeded input from precipitation or runoff.

It follows, then, that the biomarkers most likely to be found in ancient sedimentary basins on Mars are those left by organisms adapted to high salt and high pH environments. We have begun to investigate the nature of biological diversity and adaptation to these environments, and the potential for biomarker preservation in them, using Mono Lake as a terrestrial analog environment.

A laboratory investigation was conducted to describe flow and solute transport in idealized emergent plant canopies. This thesis presents labora-tory measurements of the mean drag, turbulence structure and intensity, and lateral dispersion of passive solute in arrays of randomly-distributed cylinders, a model for emergent, rigid aquatic plants. Mean drag per cylinder length normalized by the mean interstitial fluid velocity and viscosity increases linearly with cylinder Reynolds number.

40|$|International audienceMicrobe-mineral {{interactions}} {{occur in}} diverse modern environments, {{from the deep}} sea and subsurface rocks to soils and <b>surface</b> <b>aquatic</b> environments. They {{may have played a}} central role in the geochemical cycling of major (e. g., C, Fe, Ca, Mn, S, P) and trace (e. g., Ni, Mo, As, Cr) elements over Earth's history. Such interactions include electron transfer at the microbe-mineral interface that left traces in the rock record. Geomicrobiology consists in studying interactions at these organic-mineral interfaces in modern samples and looking for traces of past microbe-mineral interactions recorded in ancient rocks. Specific tools are required to probe these interfaces and to understand the mechanisms of interaction between microbes and minerals from the scale of the biofilm to the nanometer scale. In this review, we focus on recent advances in electron microscopy, in particular in cryoelectron microscopy, and on a panel of electrochemical and synchrotron-based methods that have recently provided new understanding and imaging of the microbe-mineral interface, ultimately opening new fields to be explored...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the first high-resolution dataset of dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements in an ice-lidded cryoconite hole on Canada Glacier, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Fibre optic DO minisensors were {{installed in a}} cryoconite hole prior to seasonal internal melting and hydrological connection to the subsurface drainage system. Oxygen air saturation in the cryoconite hole typically ranged from 50 to 80 %, in broad agreement with previous single measurements, indicating net respiration (R). This is consistent with results of simple incubation experiments performed in the field. Simultaneous time series for electrical conductivity, water temperature, and DO over the four-week study period provide information regarding the connectivity of cryoconite holes with the near-surface drainage system. The main driver of the observed variations in DO {{is likely to be}} periodic melt-freeze cycles. We conclude that automated sensing techniques, such as those described here, when used in conjunction with physical measurements, have great potential for high-resolution monitoring of the factors that perturb biogeochemical processes in cryospheric <b>surface</b> <b>aquatic</b> ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms {{that govern}} transport, {{accumulation}} and toxicity of persistent pollutants at interfaces in aquatic ecosystems are the foci of this thesis. Specific {{attention is paid}} to humic substances, their occurrence, composition, and role in exchange processes across interfaces. It was concluded that: Composition of humic substances in <b>aquatic</b> <b>surface</b> microlayers is {{different from that of the}} subsurface water and terrestrial humic material. Levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the <b>aquatic</b> <b>surface</b> microlayer reflect the DOC levels in the subsurface water. While the levels and enrichment of DOC in the <b>aquatic</b> <b>surface</b> microlayer generally show small variations, the levels and enrichment of particulate organic carbon (POC) vary to a great extent. Similarities exist between <b>aquatic</b> <b>surface</b> films, artificial semi-permeable and biological membranes with regard to their structure and functioning. Acidifcation and liming of fresh-water ecosystems affect DOC:POC ratio and humic composition of the surface film, thus influencing the partitioning of pollutants across interfaces. Properties of lake catchment areas extensively govern DOC:POC ratio both in the surface film and the subsurface water. Increased UV-B irradiation changes the DOC:POC ratio in the surface film and thus affects transfer of matter across the interface. Transport of lipophilic, persistent organic pollutants across semi-permeable membranes is influenced by the organic composition of the solute. Significant passive, diffusion mediated transport of lipophilic, organic pollutants across interfaces in aquatic ecosystems exists...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial diversity, {{community}} assembly, and {{the composition}} of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) were studied in three temporary subsurface karst pools with different flooding regimes. We tested the hypothesis that microorganisms introduced to the pools during floods faced environmental filtering toward a 'typical' karst water community, and we investigated whether DOM composition was related to floodings and the residence time of water in stagnant pools. As predicted, longer water residence consistently led to a decline of bacterial diversity. The microbial assemblages in the influx water harbored more 'exotic' lineages with large distances to known genotypes, yet these initial communities already appeared to be shaped by selective processes. β-Proteobacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) closely related to microbes from subsurface or <b>surface</b> <b>aquatic</b> environments were mainly responsible for the clustering of samples according to water residence time in the pools. By contrast, several Cytophagaceae and Flavobacteriaceae OTUs were related to different floodings, which were also the main determinants of DOM composition. A subset of compounds distinguishable by molecular mass and O/C content were characteristic for individual floods. Moreover, there was a transformation of DOM in stagnant pools toward smaller and more aromatic compounds, potentially also reflecting microbial utilization...|$|R

40|$|<b>Aquatic</b> <b>surface</b> microlayers {{are unique}} {{microbial}} ecosystems {{found at the}} air-water interface of all open water bodies and are {{often referred to as}} the neuston. Unambiguous interpretation of the microbiology of <b>aquatic</b> <b>surface</b> microlayers relies on robust sampling, for which several methods are available. All have particular advantages and disadvantages that make them more or less suited to this task. A key feature of surface microlayers is their role in regulating air-water gas exchange, which affords them a central role in global biogeochemistry that is only now being fully appreciated. The microbial populations in surface microlayers can impact air-water gas exchange through specific biogeochemical processes mediated by particular microbial groups such as methanotrophs or through more general metabolic activity such as the balance of primary production vs. heterotrophy. There have been relatively few studies of surface microlayers that have utilized molecular ecology techniques. The emerging consensus view is that <b>aquatic</b> <b>surface</b> microlayers are aggregate-enriched biofilm environments containing complex microbial communities that are ecologically distinct from those present in the subsurface water immediately below. Future research should focus on unravelling the complex interactions between microbial diversity and the ecosystem function of surface microlayers in order to better understand the important but complex role of microorganisms in Earth system processes...|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{increased}} UV-B on {{emissions of carbon}} dioxide and carbon monoxide (CO) and on mineral nutrient cycling in the terrestrial biosphere have been confirmed by recent studies of a range of species and ecosystems. The effects, both in magnitude and direction, of UV-B radiation on trace-gas emissions and mineral nutrient cycling are species specific and operate on a number of processes. These processes include changes in the chemical composition in living plant tissue, photodegradation (breakdown by light) of dead plant matter, including litter, release of carbon monoxide from vegetation previously charred by fire, changes in the communities of microbial decomposers, and effects on nitrogen-fixing microorganisms and plants. Long-term experiments are in place to examine UV-B effects on carbon capture and storage in biomass within natural terrestrial ecosystems. Studies in natural aquatic ecosystems have indicated that organic matter is the primary regulator of UV-B penetration. Changes in the organic matter, caused by enhanced UV-B reinforced by changes in climate and acidification, result in clarification of the water and changes in light quality that have broad impacts on the effects of enhanced UV-B on aquatic biogeochemical cycles. Increased UV-B has positive and negative impacts on microbial activity in aquatic ecosystems that can affect carbon and mineral nutrient cycling as well as the uptake and release of greenhouse and chemically reactive gases. Photoinhibition of <b>surface</b> <b>aquatic</b> microorganisms by UV-B can be partially offset by photodegradation of dissolved organic matter to produce substrates, such as organic acid...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few decades there has been a growing {{interest}} in the occurrence of micro-organic (MO) contaminants in the terrestrial and aquatic environment, and in their environmental fate and potential toxicity. A large variety of MOs are used in huge quantities for a range of purposes including arable agriculture, industrial manufacturing processes, as well as human and animal healthcare. Improvements in analytical techniques have allowed identification of organic compounds at low concentrations previously undetected in the aqueous environment. The contamination of groundwater resources by MOs is a growing concern and relatively poorly understood compared to other freshwater resources. Of particular concern are newly ‘emerging contaminants’ such as pharmaceuticals and life-style compounds, particularly those with potential endocrine disrupting properties.

40|$|The fate of {{particle}} reactive substances in a <b>surface</b> <b>aquatic</b> system {{is controlled by}} both geochemical and physical parameters. Scavenging processes in Lake Biel (Switzerland) have been studied using the anthropogenic tracer 60 Co. This isotope originates mostly in dissolved form from the Mühleberg nuclear power plant and is transported 18 km down by the River Aare to the lake. Radionuclide data from sediments, combined with inventory calculations, indicate that between 30 % and 55 % of the discharged 60 Co is transferred to sediments. Scavenging efficiency is higher during the winter period than during summer, in spite of higher particle fluxes during the summer. An intrusion model, based on buoyancy calculations, predicts that Aare water, including its radionuclide load, remains in the epilimnion during the warm period; thus, mixing is restricted to {{only a fraction of}} the lake volume and the residence time is reduced to 1 week. Buoyancy in the summer is controlled mostly by temperature. During winter, when the lake and Aare waters are close to 4 �C, the higher dissolved load of Aare water increases its density and forces it to intrude into deeper sections of the lake, increasing the residence time and thus the time available for adsorption and particle settling. The predictive capability of the model was tested for the summer period using a fluorescent dye (uranin) to track Aare water from the inflow to the outflow of the lake. Higher fluxes of both particles and associated radionuclides in deep sediment traps confirm the results of the intrusion model for th...|$|R
