40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} our work was to define the complex {{electrophysiological}} characteristics seen in second- (2 °) and third-degree (3 °) atrioventricular block (AVB) and to longitudinally follow the development of atrial and ventricular heart rate and rhythm patterns with a goal of identifying heart rate and rhythm patterns associated with urgent delivery or neonatal pacing. BackgroundThe electrophysiological characteristics of congenital AVB before birth have not been extensively studied, yet the mortality from this disease is substantial. Along with advances in fetal therapies and interventions, a comprehensive natural history specific to the etiology of AVB, {{as well as the}} electrophysiological factors influencing outcome, are needed to best select treatment options. MethodsTwenty-eight fetuses with AVB were evaluated by fetal magnetocardiography; 21 fetuses were evaluated serially. ResultsFetuses with 2 ° AVB and isolated 3 ° AVB showed: 1) diverse atrial rhythms and mechanisms of atrioventricular conduction during 2 ° AVB; 2) junctional ectopic tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia during 3 ° AVB; 3) reactive ventricular and atrial fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings at ventricular rates > 56 beats/min; and 4) flat ventricular FHR tracings at ventricular rates < 56 beats/min despite reactive atrial FHR tracings. In contrast, fetuses with 3 ° AVB associated with <b>structural</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease</b> exhibited predominantly nonreactive heart rate tracings and simpler rhythms. ConclusionsSecond-degree AVB, isolated 3 ° AVB, and 3 ° AVB associated with <b>structural</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease</b> manifest distinctly different electrophysiological characteristics and outcome. Fetuses with 2 ° AVB or isolated 3 ° AVB commonly exhibited complex, changing heart rate and rhythm patterns; all 19 delivered fetuses are alive and healthy. Fetuses with <b>structural</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease</b> and 3 ° AVB exhibited largely monotonous heart rate and rhythm patterns and poor prognosis.

40|$|Syncope {{describes}} {{a sudden and}} brief transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) with postural failure due to cerebral global hypoperfusion. The term TLOC is used when the cause is either unrelated to cerebral hypoperfusion or is unknown. The most common causes of syncopal TLOC include: (1) cardiogenic syncope (<b>cardiac</b> arrhythmias, <b>structural</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>diseases,</b> others); (2) orthostatic hypotension (due to drugs, hypovolemia, primary or secondary autonomic failure, others); (3) neurally mediated syncope (cardioinhibitory, vasodepressor, and mixed forms). Rarely neurologic disorders (such as epilepsy, transient ischemic attacks, and the subclavian steal syndrome) can lead to cerebal hypoperfusion and syncope. Nonsyncopal TLOC {{may be due to}} neurologic (epilepsy, sleep attacks, and other states with fluctuating vigilance), medical (hypoglycemia, drugs), psychiatric, or post-traumatic disorders. Basic diagnostic workup of TLOC includes a thorough history and physical examination, and a 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Blood testing, electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, echocardiography, head-up tilt test, carotid sinus massage, Holter monitoring, and loop recorders should be obtained only in specific contexts.

In both patients, inde-pendent areas of LGE were evident in the left ventricular (LV) wall, emanating separately from the two co-existing disease processes. This is a capability confined to contrast-CMR. The images of LGE associated with CAD and HCM shown here are distinctive in appearance. For myocardial infarction, LGE was characterised by high signal intensity, located in the subendocardial region of the LV, within the region of distribution of the occluded coronary artery.

40|$|This review {{summarizes}} the evidences {{in the literature}} on the management of the Brugada syndrome (BS), an arrhythmogenic disease caused by genetic channelopathies, predisposing to syncope and sudden cardiac death in young, apparently healthy, typically male subjects, in the third and fourth decade of their life. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is defined as natural death from cardiac causes, heralded by abrupt loss of consciousness within one hour of the onset of symptoms. It ranks among the main causes of death in the western world, with an incidence ranging from 0. 36 and 1. 28 ‰ inhabitants per year, equal to 300, 000 cases a year in the USA. In the majority of the cases it is due to the onset of arrhythmia in subjects with <b>structural</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>diseases,</b> especially ischemic heart disease. However, in a non-negligible percentage of the cases, about 5 - 10 %, the SCD arises in relatively young individuals in whom cardiac anomalies cannot be detected using traditional diagnostic techniques. About 20 % of these cases can be attributed to SB. In spite of the many efforts produced to identify an effective pharmacological treatment, to date the only aid to reduce the mortality rate in subjects with SB is an implantable cardio-defibrillator (ICD). Since this approach often entails complications, the efforts of the scientific community is now focused on the assessment of the arrhythmic risk. The identification of high-risk subjects is one of the chief objectives in the therapeutic decision-making process. ABSTRACT clinica e terapia emergenc...|$|R

40|$|Episodes of {{transient}} loss {{of consciousness}} (TLOC) events pose diagnostic difficulties, as the causes are diverse, carry vastly different risks, and span various specialties. An inconsistent terminology contributes to the confusion. Here, we present a classification scheme for TLOC, based on ongoing multidisciplinary efforts {{including those of the}} Task Force on Syncope of the European Society of Cardiology. We also discuss the pathophysiology of TLOC and the key clinical features that aid diagnosis. TLOC is defined as an apparent {{loss of consciousness}} with an abrupt onset, a short duration, and a spontaneous and complete recovery. Syncope is defined as TLOC due to cerebral hypoperfusion, and is divided into reflex syncope (synonymous with neurally mediated syncope), syncope due to orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac syncope (arrhythmic or associated with <b>structural</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease).</b> The other major groups of TLOC are generalized epileptic seizures, functional TLOC (psychogenic TLOC mimicking either epilepsy or syncope), and a further group of miscellaneous disorders.

The expanding use of contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) in patients with acute abdomen may change the spectrum of renal infarction. METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive patients presenting to a single university hospital with nontraumatic CT-documented acute renal infarction were studied and stratified according to {{the presence or absence of}} <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease,</b> either obvious at presentation or detected during work-up. RESULTS: Eleven patients (41 %) had obvious <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease,</b> including atrial fibrillation in all but one. Sixteen patients (59 %) had no discernible <b>structural</b> or arrhythmic <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease</b> and were classified as idiopathic group. Patients in the idiopathic group were significantly younger (median age in years [interquartile range]: 48 [41 - 53] versus 75 [53 - 82] years, P =. 003) and, besides smoking, had fewer traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

40|$|Mutations in {{the cardiac}} ryanodine type 2 {{receptor}} (RyR 2) gene {{are associated with}} catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. We hypothesized that these mutations could be detected at autopsy in cases of exercise-triggered sudden death. Fourteen sudden death patients, eight males and six females, were studied at autopsy based on apparent sudden cardiac death, without significant anatomical abnormalities. The coding regions of arrhythmia genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and directly sequenced. Three novel RyR 2 mutations, R 414 C, F 2331 S, and R 2401 L, were identified in three unrelated patients (two males and one female; mean age at death, 12 ± 2 years), all performing strenuous activity {{at the time of}} death or collapse. These mutations were located in highly conserved regions where arrhythmia-linked RyR 2 mutations clustered.

Only seven cases of A biotrophia infective endocarditis have been previously reported in children with no underlying structural heart disease. We report two cases of A biotrophia infective endocarditis in children without any predisposing factors. Both patients presented with nonspecific symptoms leading to delay in diagnosis.

A cardiac murmur can be {{the first sign of}} a serious <b>structural</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease.</b> Abnormal auscultatory findings, usually murmurs, are the most common reason for referral to the pediatric cardiologist. Methods: In a case series study, children and adolescents with heart murmurs, referred to or admitted at Fatemeh Zahra (S) Hospital of Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, were evaluated between 2001 and 2006. The age range of participants was from birth to 18 years old. Chest x-ray, ECG, and echocardiography were done for them in addition to history taking and physical examination.

40|$|Severe and {{occasionally}} fatal arrhythmias, commonly presenting as Torsade de Pointes [TdP] {{have been reported}} with Class III-antiarrhythmics, but also with non-antiarrhythmic drugs. Most cases result from an action on K+ channels encoded by the HERG gene responsible for the IKr repolarizing current, leading to a long QT and repolarization abnormalities. The hydrophobic central cavity of the HERG-K+ channels, allows {{a large number of}} structurally unrelated drugs to bind and cause direct channel inhibition. Some examples are dofetilide, quinidine, sotalol, erythromycin, grepafloxacin, cisapride, dolasetron, thioridazine, haloperidol, droperidol and pimozide. Other drugs achieve channel inhibition indirectly by impairing channel traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane, decreasing channel membrane density (pentamidine, geldalamicin, arsenic trioxide, digoxin, and probucol). Whereas, ketoconazole, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine induce both direct channel inhibition and impaired channel trafficking. Congenital long QT syndrome, subclinical ion-channel mutations, subjects and relatives of subjects with previous history of drug-induced long QT or TdP, dual drug effects on cardiac repolarization [long QT plus increased QT dispersion], increased transmural dispersion of repolarization and T wave abnormalities, use of high doses, metabolism inhibitors and/or combinations of QT prolonging drugs, hypokalemia, <b>structural</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease,</b> sympathomimetics, bradycardia, women and older age, have been shown to increase the risk for developing drug-induced TdP.

40|$|<b>Cardiac</b> <b>disease</b> is {{not easy}} to {{recognise}} in general practice. An echocardiogram is an excellent way to provide information about left ventricular mass and diastolic (dys) function and the presence of valvular heart disease. To improve diagnostic care of cardiac patients, an open access echocardiography service was established in the referral area of our hospital, where general practitioners were able to ask for an echocardiogram without referring the patient to the cardiologist. Between December 2002 and October 2006 echocardiograms were requested for 471 patients. Thirteen percent of the patients referred for dyspnoea and 3 % of patients with a cardiac murmur had a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 %. In 28 % of patients no cardiac abnormality could be found.

40|$|Background: Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{is highly}} common, and is most frequently observed in individuals with hypertension and <b>structural</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease.</b> Sympathetic hyperactivity plays a fundamental {{role in the}} progression, maintenance and aggravation of arrhythmia. Endurance exercise training clearly lowers sympathetic activity in sympathoexcitatory disease states, and is well-tolerated by patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: We assessed 50 CKD patients with hypertension. Each patient provided a complete medical history and underwent a physical examination. We used an implantable cardiac monitor over a 3 -year follow-up period to evaluate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate exercise (ModEx) physical activity protocols on AF occurrence, and determined the effectiveness of these protocols in improving renal function. Subjects were followed up every 6 months after the beginning of the intervention. Results: During the 3 -year follow-up, AF onset was higher in CKD patients who engaged in HIIT (72 %) than in those who engaged in ModEx (24 %) (hazard ratio, 3. 847; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 694 – 8. 740, P = 0. 0013 by log-rank test). Both groups exhibited significant intra-group changes in the mean systolic 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM) between baseline and 12, 24, and 36 months. There were also significant differences in the mean systolic 24 -hour ABPM between the groups at the same time points. Conclusion: In CKD patients with hypertension, improvements in AF onset, renal function and some echocardiographic parameters were more evident in subjects who engaged in ModEx than in those who engaged in HIIT during 3 years of follow-up...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{may occur}} {{in the absence of}} identifiable causes, co-morbidities or <b>structural</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease</b> (lone AF). Silent AF is common and patients may have a completely asymptomatic arrhythmia or may experience both symptomatic and asymptomatic AF episodes. It has been estimated that among patients with recognized AF, one third has no appreciable symptoms. In contemporary clinical practice, AF remains largely underdiagnosed and 25 % of patients with AF-associated cardioembolic stroke have not been previously diagnosed with AF. The strategies for AF screening include opportunistic and systematic screening. Several methods for AF detection are nowadays available: from very simple (pulse palpation) to more advanced technologies proposed for ambulatory external monitoring of variable time duration. In patients previously implanted with cardiac electrical devices with an atrial lead, according to current clinical indications, the ability to continuously detect AF and to monitor its evolution is magnified, and AF burden can be precisely measured and monitored along with time. Similar information on AF burden can be also obtained by implantation of subcutaneous cardiac monitors that rely on the analysis of consecutive RR intervals for the diagnosis of AF. The prognosis is generally favorable for patients presenting with lone AF, but adverse outcomes, including stroke and thromboembolic events may occur at long term, in association with aging, or the development of underlying heart disease, or progression from paroxysmal to permanent AF. In this respect, the role of new technologies and diagnostic tools for AF detection and monitoring should be fully defined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Severe and {{occasionally}} fatal arrhythmias, commonly presenting as Torsade de Pointes [TdP] {{have been reported}} with Class III-antiarrhythmics, but also with non-antiarrhythmic drugs. Most cases result from an action on K + channels encoded by the HERG gene responsible for the IKr repolarizing current, leading to a long QT and repolarization abnormalities. The hydrophobic central cavity of the HERG-K + channels, allows {{a large number of}} structurally unrelated drugs to bind and cause direct channel inhibition. Some examples are dofetilide, quinidine, sotalol, erythromycin, grepafloxacin, cisapride, dolasetron, thioridazine, haloperidol, droperidol and pimozide. Other drugs achieve channel inhibition indirectly by impairing channel traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane, decreasing channel membrane density (pentamidine, geldalamicin, arsenic trioxide, digoxin, and probucol). Whereas, ketoconazole, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine induce both direct channel inhibition and impaired channel trafficking. Congenital long QT syndrome, subclinical ion-channel mutations, subjects and relatives of subjects with previous history of drug-induced long QT or TdP, dual drug effects on cardiac repolarization [long QT plus increased QT dispersion], increased transmural dispersion of repolarization and T wave abnormalities, use of high doses, metabolism inhibitors and/or combinations of QT prolonging drugs, hypokalemia, <b>structural</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease,</b> sympathomimetics, bradycardia, women and older age, have been shown to increase the risk for developing drug-induced TdP. Because most of these reactions are preventable, careful evaluation of risk factors and increased knowledge of drugs use associated with repolarization abnormalities is strongly recommended. Future genetic testing and development of practical and simple provocation tests are in route to prevent iatrogenic TdP...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Although cardiac {{auscultation}} remains {{important to}} detect abnormal sounds and murmurs indicative of cardiac pathology, {{the application of}} electronic methods remains seldom used in everyday clinical practice. In this report we provide preliminary data showing how the phonocardiogram can be analyzed using color spectrographic techniques and discuss how such information may be of future value for noninvasive cardiac monitoring. Methods We digitally recorded the phonocardiogram using a high-speed USB interface and the program Gold Wave [URL] in 55 infants and adults with <b>cardiac</b> <b>structural</b> <b>disease</b> {{as well as from}} normal individuals and individuals with innocent murmurs. Color spectrographic analysis of the signal was performed using Spectrogram (Version 16) as a well as custom MATLAB code. Results Our preliminary data is presented as a series of seven cases. Conclusions We expect the application of spectrographic techniques to phonocardiography to grow substantially as ongoing research demonstrates its utility in various clinical settings. Our evaluation of a simple, low-cost phonocardiographic recording and analysis system to assist in determining the characteristic features of heart murmurs shows promise in helping distinguish innocent systolic murmurs from pathological murmurs in children and is expected to useful in other clinical settings as well. </p...|$|R
