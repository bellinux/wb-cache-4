5|$|The {{multiple}} <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> of {{amino acids}} can also undergo chemical reactions. The types of these reactions {{are determined by}} the groups on these <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> and are, therefore, different between the various types of amino acid.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible inhibitors usually covalently modify an enzyme, and {{inhibition}} {{can therefore}} not be reversed. Irreversible inhibitors often contain reactive functional {{groups such as}} nitrogen mustards, aldehydes, haloalkanes, alkenes, Michael acceptors, phenyl sulfonates, or fluorophosphonates. These electrophilic groups react with amino acid <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> to form covalent adducts. The residues modified are those with <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> containing nucleophiles such as hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups; these include the amino acids serine (as in DFP, right), cysteine, threonine, or tyrosine.|$|E
5|$|At pH values {{between the}} two pKa values, the {{zwitterion}} predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint {{between the two}} pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH {{is known as the}} isoelectric point pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged <b>side</b> <b>chains,</b> the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative <b>side</b> <b>chains,</b> pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive <b>side</b> <b>chains,</b> pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar <b>side</b> <b>chains)</b> can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.|$|E

5|$|Most {{proteins}} {{consist of}} linear polymers built from series {{of up to}} 20 different L-α-amino acids. All proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features, including an α-carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a variable side chain are bonded. Only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO–NH amide moiety into a fixed conformation. The <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> of the standard amino acids, detailed {{in the list of}} standard amino acids, have a great variety of chemical structures and properties; it is the combined effect of all of the amino acid <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> in a protein that ultimately determines its three-dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. High-accuracy protein {{structure}} modeling demands on accurate and very fast <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> prediction since such a procedure must be repeatedly called {{at each step}} of structure refinement. Many known <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> prediction programs, such as SCWRL and TreePack, depend on the philosophy that global information and pairwise energy function must be used to achieve high accuracy. These programs are too slow {{to be used in}} the case when <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> packing has to be used thousands of times, such as {{protein structure}} refinement and protein design. We present an unexpected study that local backbone information can determine <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> conformations accurately. LocalPack, our <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> packing program which is based on only local information, achieves equal accuracy as SCWRL and TreePack, yet runs many times faster, hence providing a key missing piece in our efforts to high-accuracy protein structure modeling. keyword: <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> prediction, local backbone features, multiclass Support Vector Machines. ...|$|R
5|$|Because protein {{structures}} {{are composed of}} amino acids whose <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> are linked by a common protein backbone, {{a number of different}} possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein macromolecule can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the peptide bond. For simplicity and efficiency, often only the alpha carbon positions are considered, since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side-chain atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein backbone but also the rotameric states of the <b>side</b> <b>chains.</b> Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include secondary structure assignment, native contact maps or residue interaction patterns, measures of side chain packing, and measures of hydrogen bond retention.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, {{research}} chemists in Heilmeier {{group at}} RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed {{only in the}} number of carbon atoms in the terminal <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of Schiff base compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22–105°C. Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made. The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points. This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide operating temperature range eventually became the industry standard and is used to this very day to tailor materials to meet specific applications.|$|E
5|$|In {{alternative}} fashion, the (S) and (R) designators {{are used}} to indicate the absolute stereochemistry. Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are (S) at the α carbon, with cysteine being (R) and glycine non-chiral. Cysteine has its side chain in the same geometric position as the other amino acids, but the R/S terminology is reversed because of the higher atomic number of sulfur compared to the carboxyl oxygen gives the side chain a higher priority, whereas the atoms in most other <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> give them lower priority.|$|E

30|$|Additionally, we {{compared}} the conformations of Lys 49 in our LC 3 B-FUNDC 1 complex structure and apo LC 3 B (PDB ID: 3 VTU) (Fig.  5 D).

In apo LC 3 B, the Lys 49 <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> forms hydrophobic interactions with the aromatic ring of Phe 52, occupying the space for the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> of the FUNDC 1 Glu 19 in the complex structure. However, in the complex structure, a largely shift (8.2  Å) of the Lys 49 <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> is induced by its interaction with the pS 17 of FUNDC 1, providing enough space to accommodate the FUNDC 1 LIR, especially the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> of Glu 19 (Fig.  5 D).|$|R
5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E
5|$|Short {{proteins}} {{can also}} be synthesized chemically by a family of methods known as peptide synthesis, which rely on organic synthesis techniques such as chemical ligation to produce peptides in high yield. Chemical synthesis allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids into polypeptide chains, such as attachment of fluorescent probes to amino acid <b>side</b> <b>chains.</b> These methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology, though generally not for commercial applications. Chemical synthesis is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about 300 amino acids, and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure. Most chemical synthesis methods proceed from C-terminus to N-terminus, opposite the biological reaction.|$|E
5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.|$|E

5|$|Amino acids are organic {{compounds}} containing amine (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, {{along with a}} side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N), although other elements {{are found in the}} <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and can be classified in many ways. They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups' locations as alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or delta- (δ-) amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and side chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulfur, etc.). In the form of proteins, amino acid residues form the second-largest component (water is the largest) of human muscles and other tissues. Beyond their role as residues in proteins, amino acids participate in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are under}} {{development}} as {{components of a}} range of biodegradable polymers.

These polymers include polypeptides, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as <b>side</b> <b>chains.</b> These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor. In addition, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as bisphenol A in the manufacture of polycarbonates.|$|E
5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.|$|E

We consider the reasons for successes and limitations of this approach by calculating and comparing the conditional excess free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of hydration of the isoleucine <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> in zwitterionic isoleucine, in extended penta-peptides, and in helical deca-peptides. Butane in gauche conformation serves as a small-molecule analog for the isoleucine <b>side</b> <b>chain.</b> Parsing the hydrophobic and hydrophilic contributions to hydration for the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> shows that both of these aspects of hydration are context-sensitive. Furthermore, analyzing the solute−solvent interaction contribution to the conditional excess enthalpy of the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> shows that what is nominally considered a property of the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> includes entirely nonobvious contributions of the background. The context-sensitivity of hydrophobic and hydrophilic hydration and the conflation of background contributions with energetics attributed to the <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> limit the ability of a single scaling factor, such as the fractional solvent exposure of the group in the protein, to map the component energetic contributions of the model...|$|R

5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} encoded {{directly}} by the genetic code {{can be divided into}} several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, size, and functional groups. These properties are important for protein structure and protein–protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried {{in the middle of the}} protein, whereas hydrophilic <b>side</b> <b>chains</b> are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (Note that in biochemistry, a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide, protein or nucleic acid.) The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine. There are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues.|$|E

It can be suggested that addition of appropriate electron withdrawing groups at the A 2, A 3, cyano, and amide (carbamoyl <b>side</b> <b>chain)</b> sites will append the HMG-CoA reductase inhibition, whereas the addition of electron-withdrawing groups near carboxy group attached to pyrrole ring position will contribute to decreased receptor binding, which in turn will result in lower potency of compounds because red color cubes are for negative effect of electron-withdrawing group to that particular place. Figure 3 b illustrates that H-bond donor characteristic is necessary at A 2 and A 3 (N-iso-propyl <b>side</b> <b>chain)</b> present on the pyrrole ring. The red cubes at the benzene ring attached to the amide <b>side</b> <b>chain</b> of pyrrole ring demonstrate a negative potential of H-bond donor at that position on the compounds.
