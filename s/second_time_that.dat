This marked only the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the 'T' name {{has been used to}} name an Atlantic storm since alphabetical naming began in 1950; the other time was for Tanya in 1995 (later on there would be Tomas in 2010 and Tony in 2012).|$|E
5|$|Coates {{reached his}} peak at the 1976 games in Innsbruck. He competed in five events, {{and apart from}} a 25th-place finish in the 500m event, did no worse than 11th in the {{remaining}} four. He came sixth in the 10,000m, eighth in the 1,500m and tenth in the 5,000m. It was only the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> an Australian had placed in the top 10, and remained Australia's best result until 1994. His five skiing compatriots were less productive; they registered in 13 races between them and completed only seven due to crashes and disqualifications, with only one top 30 result.|$|E
5|$|Copies of Kids Can Say No! were {{purchased}} by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. The VHS tapes circulated widely {{in schools and}} rape crisis centers in Australia; although showings began to decrease as VHS became less popular, the film was a significant teaching tool.

In the team competition, the nation finished seventh out of eight nations, ranking higher than Australia.|$|E
5|$|For Georgia, {{discussion}} {{centered on}} the play-calling duties of assistant coach Mike Bobo. Bobo had been named the temporary offensive coordinator for the Bulldogs after then-assistant coordinator Neil Calloway had been named the new head coach at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. Calloway would remain with the Bulldogs as the offensive line coach during the Chick-fil-A Bowl, but Bobo would take over his role as offensive coordinator for the game. It was only the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Bobo performed as a play-caller for the Bulldogs, the previous game having come in Georgia's regular-season closer, a 15–12 win against Georgia Tech.|$|E

Entering the final minute and {{trailing}} by one, Pittsburgh pulled Fleury for the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> game, hoping to score with circumstances similar to Hossa's earlier goal. A tipped shot which passed in between Chris Osgood and the goal line as time expired did not enter the net, giving Detroit the victory. Pittsburgh's final defeat of the season was by a score of 3–2.|$|E

The M-143 portion of Michigan Avenue runs from the East Lansing city limit to a junction with M-43 at Grand River Avenue. This highway is the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> {{there has been an}} M-143 in Michigan. The first was a connection to the original Cheboygan State Park. The current is a remnant of M-43 in the Lansing area.|$|E
5|$|The 1886 Navy Midshipmen {{football}} team represented the United States Naval Academy in the 1886 college football season.

The year began with consecutive wins over rivals St. John's College and Johns Hopkins, but then reversed {{with a loss}} to the former and a close victory over the latter. The year concluded with shutout losses to the Princeton reserve squad and Gallaudet. The season was the program's longest until 1890, when that year's team played seven games.|$|E

Harvard was the preseason favorite {{for the first time and}} spent most of the season receiving vote in the 2011–12 national rankings. The season marked the first time that four Ivy League teams (Harvard, Penn, Princeton and Yale) participated in the postseason. The season marked the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the Ivy League had three 20-win teams (Harvard, Penn and Princeton).|$|E
5|$|Accusing the Song {{of violating}} the {{agreement}} and realizing {{the weakness of the}} Song, the Jin generals launched a second punitive campaign, again dividing their troops into two armies. Wanyan Zonghan, who had withdrawn from Taiyuan after the Kaifeng agreement and left a small force in charge of the siege, came back with his western army. Overwhelmed, Taiyuan fell in September 1126, after 260 days of siege. When the Song court received news of the fall of Taiyuan, the officials who had advocated defending the empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by counselors who favored appeasement. In mid December the two Jurchen armies converged on Kaifeng for the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> year.|$|E
5|$|As {{currently}} defined, the Atlantic {{hurricane season}} lasts from June1 to November30, {{the period in}} which tropical cyclones are most likely to develop across the basin. Occasionally, systems develop outside the season, most frequently in May or December. Activity in January is considered extremely rare, with only five other known instances since 1851: an unnamed hurricane in 1938, an unnamed tropical storm in 1951, Hurricane Alice in 1954–55, an unnamed storm in 1978, and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005–06. Since Alice originated in December1954, Alex is only the second hurricane to develop solely within January, after the 1938 storm. When Alex made landfall on Terceira as a strong tropical storm this marked only the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> an Atlantic tropical cyclone has made landfall in January, with the other being Hurricane Alice of 1955 which made landfall on Saint Martin and Saba. In addition to forming well outside of hurricane season, Alex developed unusually far north and east, becoming only the second hurricane to form north of 30°N and east of 30°W.|$|E

5|$|Bradford City were {{struggling}} in the Second Division {{at the time}} of Cowan's signing, having won just one of their first ten games of the 1935–36 season. Cowan made his debut for them on 19 October 1935 in a 2–2 draw with Swindon Town, {{but it was not until}} Cowan's third game that Bradford won for the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> season. Cowan missed just three of the club's remaining fixtures that season, playing 29 times in the league and three in the FA Cup as City finished 12th. The following season, City again struggled. Cowan missed just one of the first 23 games, but after Christmas, he was restricted to just six; and without Cowan, Bradford finished 21st and were relegated to the Third Division (North).|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Exclusion Bill would be passed, and bolstered by some acquittals in the {{continuing}} Plot trials, which seemed to him to indicate a more favourable public mood towards Catholicism, Charles dissolved the English Parliament, for a <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> year, in mid-1679. Charles's hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled; {{within a few months}} he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after it sought to pass the Exclusion Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days. During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted (albeit unsuccessfully) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.|$|E
5|$|For the <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> season, Barcelona played Real Madrid in El Clásico, {{this time}} at the Santiago Bernabéu. Barcelona won the {{historic}} match 2–6, which was the largest margin of victory by which Barcelona had won in Madrid since the 1970s, when Johan Cruyff led Barcelona to win 0–5. On 6 May 2009, Barcelona played against Chelsea in the second leg of the Champions League semi-finals. Following a goalless first leg, Chelsea led the second leg at Stamford Bridge 1–0, from the eighth minute until injury time, when Andrés Iniesta scored an equaliser in the 93rd minute {{from the edge of}} the penalty area, sending Barcelona through to the final on the away goals rule. On 13 May, Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey for a record 25th time. Three days later, Real Madrid lost a league match and Barcelona was crowned La Liga champions for the 2008–09 season.|$|E
