40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Underage {{college women}} {{are at high}} risk for alcohol use and <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> and {{targeting}} both alcohol use and <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> is needed for this population. The current 3 studies examined the etiology and reduction of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> and re-assault on college campuses among women. Study 1 was a prospective assessment of the use of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> protective behavioral strategies (PBS) on subsequent <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> incidence and severity. The use of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> PBS at Time 1 was associated with less <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> incidence and severity at Time 2. Study 2 furthered this by examining the relationship between <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> PBS, drinking PBS, <b>sexual</b> <b>assault,</b> and re-assault. Both <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> PBS and drinking PBS were associated with <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> and re-assault in college. Study 3 was a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of a combined intervention targeting both <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> risk and alcohol use in college women to reduce <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> and re-assault. The combined intervention decreased incapacitated rape, <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> incidence and severity, and frequency of heavy-episodic drinking for women with higher incidence and severity of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> at baseline. Taken together, targeting both alcohol use and <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> risk in college women may be an effective way to decrease <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> and re-assault on college campuses...|$|R

Another purpose was to assess whether or not <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> survivors who do not blame themselves for their attack tend to blame other survivors. The participants' attributional style was also assessed in order to understand the relations between self-blame and survivor blame in situations involving <b>sexual</b> <b>assault.</b> Findings indicated that certain types of attributional style are related to self-blame in <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> survivors and blame toward <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> survivors depicted in vignettes.

40|$|Purpose — We {{sought to}} examine {{relationships}} between women’s sexual orientations and their <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> experiences {{before and during}} university. Methods — Self-reported responses on a web-based survey of 5, 439 female undergraduates {{who participated in the}} Campus <b>Sexual</b> <b>Assault</b> study were analyzed to compare three groups: bisexuals, lesbians, and heterosexuals. Groups were compared in terms of the prevalence of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> before and during university, {{and the extent to which}} <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> before university predicted <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> during university. Findings — The prevalence of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> before and during university was higher among bisexuals and lesbians compared with heterosexuals (25. 4 % of bisexuals, 22. 4 % of lesbians, and 10. 7 % of heterosexuals were sexually assaulted before university; 24. 0 % of bisexuals, 17. 9 % of lesbians, and 13. 3 % of heterosexuals were sexually <b>assaulted</b> during university). <b>Sexual</b> <b>assault</b> before university was highly predictive of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> during university, especially among non-heterosexuals. Compared with heterosexuals not sexually assaulted before university (the referent group), previously assaulted non-heterosexuals (bisexuals/lesbians) had eight times the odds of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> during university (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 8. 75), whereas previously assaulted heterosexuals had four times the odds of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> during university (AOR, 4. 40). However, there was no difference in the odds of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> during university between non-heterosexuals not sexually assaulted before university and heterosexuals not sexually assaulted before university. Conclusion — Bisexual and lesbian women are more likely than heterosexual women to be sexually assaulted before and during university. <b>Sexual</b> <b>assault</b> before university is linked to <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> during university for all women, with this association being especially pronounced among non-heterosexuals...|$|R

40|$|This study {{set out to}} {{investigate}} the incidence and social implications of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> within the West Australian prison system. One of the key aims was to gauge the levels of both reported and unreported <b>sexual</b> <b>assault,</b> questioning the prison authority’s claim that prison rape is a rare occurrence. Although <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> occurs within {{both male and female}} prison populations, this study looked only at men’s experiences, concentrating on men who had served time in prisons in and around the Perth metropolitan area. The researchers’ questions covered overtly violent <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> as well as <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> through coercion. Within this context, the researchers attempted to provide an overall estimate of the prevalence of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> within the male prisoner population in Western Australia. They also explored the connections between self harm, suicide ideation and <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> and looked at any links between past sexual victimisation and the likelihood of becoming a sexual predator. The two specific research questions that the study addressed were; • What factors might help to provide a basis from which to reduce the incidence of prison <b>sexual</b> <b>assault?</b> • What types of service provision might better assist victims of prison <b>sexual</b> <b>assault...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{contribute}} to and clarify the debate around false allegations of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> by providing a summary of recent literature, including consideration of the classifications and methods of defining a false allegation, {{whether there is a}} prevailing scepticism around allegations of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault,</b> and the motivations for falsifying reports. Key messages:There is ongoing speculation about the prevalence of false allegations of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault,</b> however, without consistency in definition and classification of what actually is a false allegation, accurate measurement of prevalence is difficult. Assumptions are made about the truth of allegations of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> at various decision-making points in the justice response. These assumptions are based on individual and societal beliefs about gender roles and <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> that may not accord with the actual experiences of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault.</b> The perception that false allegations of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> are common has negative consequences for victims of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> and society more generally by perpetuating victims’ fear of being disbelieved or being blamed for the assault. This reduces the likelihood of reporting. A more useful approach to considering false allegations of <b>sexual</b> <b>assault</b> is to undertake more contextual analysis of the factors that play into a label of false allegations...|$|R
