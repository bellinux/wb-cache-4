I didn't really know what to do for her because I didn't hear nothing else that was on the album, but I just felt like she didn't have that bounce on her album.|$|E
25|$|Searchers combed a 20-block {{radius of}} the car but found nothing. Police soon came to doubt Biryukova's account. Her car, when tested, proved to have {{adequate}} fuel in its tank and operated normally. In an hour wandering the neighborhood before <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gas station, she apparently made little effort to seek help from residents. She had left her home with a purportedly sick child but not taken her wallet, purse and phone. No gas can {{was found in the}} car.|$|E
500|$|Thatcher's {{daughter}} Carol [...] {{that her}} mother had dementia in 2005, revealing that [...] "Mum doesn't read much any more because of her memory loss". In her 2008 memoir, Carol wrote {{that her mother}} [...] "could hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end". She later recounted how she was first struck by her mother's dementia when, in conversation, Thatcher had confused the Falklands and Yugoslav conflicts; she recalled the pain of needing to tell her mother repeatedly that her husband Denis was dead.|$|E

500|$|After leaving Versailles, neither Jourdain nor Moberly {{mentioned}} the incident {{to one another}} until a week later. Moberly wrote a letter about the trip to her sister and when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> afternoon of the Versailles incident, she asked Jourdain if she thought the Petit Trianon was haunted. Jourdain {{told her that she}} thought it was. Three months later in Oxford, [...] they compared their notes, then decided to write separate accounts of what happened and research the history of the Trianon. In doing so, they found that on 10 August 1792, the Tuileries palace in Paris was besieged, the king's Swiss guards were massacred and the monarchy itself was abolished six weeks later.|$|E
500|$|Although Scott is antipathetic towards Richardson's final novel, not {{everyone}} {{was of the}} same opinion; Jane Austen was a devotee of the novel, {{which was part of}} her mental furniture to the point where she could claim to describe [...] "all that was ever said or done in the cedar parlour". She would for example casually compare a flower in a new cap <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> white feather described by Harriet Byron as being in hers. Nevertheless, throughout her life she also subjected Grandison to much affectionate, even satirical mockery - adapting it into a dramatic lampoon (not published until 1980) around 1800. Her juvenalia also included a heroine who guyed Harriet Byron's frequent fainting, through being “in such a hurry to have a succession of fainting fits, that she had scarcely patience enough to recover from one before she fell into another”. As late as 1813, she would respond to a long letter from her sister Cassandra by exclaiming “Dear me!...Like Harriet Byron I ask, what am I to do with my Gratitude”.|$|E
500|$|On June 12, Hubbard {{was awarded}} a divorce in the County Court of Sedgwick County, Kansas {{on the basis of}} Northrup's [...] "gross neglect of duty and extreme cruelty", which had caused him [...] "nervous {{breakdown}} and impairment to health." [...] She did not give evidence but was awarded custody of Alexis and $200 a month in child support. She left Wichita as soon as Alexis was returned to her. Her reunion with her daughter was uncertain to the last, as Hubbard had second thoughts about letting her go as he drove Northrup and Alexis to the local airport. She persuaded him that the compulsion instilled by the communists would be dissipated by going ahead with the flight: [...] "Well, I have to follow their dictates. I'll just go to the airplane." [...] She was so desperate to leave by the time <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airport that she left behind her daughter's clothes and her own suitcase and one of Alexis's shoes fell off as she dashed to the plane. [...] "I just ran across the airfield, across the runways, to the airport and got on the plane. And it was the nineteenth of June and it was the happiest day of my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Phial of Dread {{was one of}} Ludlow's {{earliest}} magazine stories, {{published in}} October 1859.

2500|$|In 1932, Bennett {{returned}} from Europe with a three-year-old child, whom she {{claimed to have}} adopted and named Peter Bennett Plant. In 1942, however, during a battle over a large trust fund established to benefit any descendants of her former husband, Bennett announced that her adopted son actually was her natural child by Plant, born after the divorce and kept hidden {{to ensure that the}} child's biological father did not get custody. During the court hearings, the actress told her former mother-in-law and her husband's widow that [...] "if <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> witness stand she would give a complete account of her life with Plant.

2500|$|Case-law {{where this}} test applies {{includes}} McLoughlin v O'Brian [...] AC 410, {{in which the}} husband and children of the claimant {{were involved in a}} car accident that was caused by the negligence of the defendant. The claimant found out about the accident an hour later and, when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hospital two hours later, one child had already died. She saw her husband and children suffering and suffered shock, depression and a change of personality. The court established a spectrum of proximity; a pedestrian should be able to withstand seeing the accidents that occur in everyday life, but a family member of the victims will inevitably suffer greater emotional harm. Nonetheless, simply seeing the aftermath of the accident and not witnessing it is insufficient proximity. Similarly, seeing a video of the accident is insufficient.|$|E
