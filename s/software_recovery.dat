50|$|Practically, the MVS <b>software</b> <b>recovery</b> made problem {{debugging}} both {{easier and}} more difficult. <b>Software</b> <b>recovery</b> requires that programs leave 'tracks' of {{where they are and}} what they are doing, thus facilitating debuggingâ€”but the fact that processing progresses despite an error can overwrite the tracks. Early date capture {{at the time of the}} error maximizes debugging, and facilities exist for the recovery routines (task and system mode, both) to do this.|$|E

40|$|Software {{architectures}} evolve {{over time}} due to requirement and technology changes. Hence, <b>software</b> architecture <b>recovery</b> is often necessary {{to capture and}} document existing systems to effectively support product evolution and maintenance. Architectures of existing systems can be recovered using reverse engineering techniques. Reverse engineering deals with deriving higher-level descriptions of a software system from existing software artifacts, primarily source code. Reverse engineering of source code, often, is a time consuming task. For reasons of limited resources or competition, software architectures could be recovered more efficiently by studying solutions from similar systems. This paper presents an approach for rapid and agile <b>software</b> architecture <b>recovery</b> in a mature domain, network applications. We demonstrate a case study for <b>software</b> architecture <b>recovery</b> by examining an existing architecture in the same domain. The existing architecture help derive a conceptual description for the target system. Meanwhile, some well-known design patterns in the similar domain are used to compare with the target system. The knowledge gained from design patterns provides more detailed information. The process is coupled with iterative reviews of the source code to refine the recovered software architecture.

50|$|MVS took a {{major step}} forward in fault-tolerance, built on the earlier STAE facility, that IBM called <b>software</b> <b>recovery.</b> IBM decided to do this after years of {{practical}} real-world experience with MVT in the business world. System failures were now having major impacts on customer businesses, and IBM decided to take a major design jump, to assume that despite the very best software development and testing techniques, that 'problems WILL occur.' This profound assumption was pivotal in adding great percentages of fault-tolerance code to the system and likely contributed to the system's success in tolerating software and hardware failures. Statistical information is hard to come by to prove the value of these design features (how can you measure 'prevented' or 'recovered' problems?), but IBM has, in many dimensions, enhanced these fault-tolerant <b>software</b> <b>recovery</b> and rapid problem resolution features, over time.|$|E

50|$|IBM {{included}} {{additional criteria}} for a major software problem that required IBM service. If a mainline component failed to initiate <b>software</b> <b>recovery,</b> that was considered a valid reportable failure. Also, if a recovery routine failed to collect significant diagnostic data such that the original problem was solvable by data collected by that recovery routine, IBM standards dictated that this fault was reportable and required repair. Thus, IBM standards, when rigorously applied, encouraged continuous improvement.|$|E

Several {{different}} techniques have been adopted in vast literature to recover Software Architecture. One of the techniques is clustering, which extracts the similar components from the software.

40|$|As {{technology}} scales ever further, device unreliability {{is creating}} excessive complexity for hardware {{to maintain the}} illusion of perfect operation. In this paper, we consider whether exposing hardware fault information to software and allowing software to control fault recovery simplifies hardware design and helps technology scaling. The combination of emerging applications and emerging many-core architectures makes <b>software</b> <b>recovery</b> {{a viable alternative to}} hardware-based fault recovery. Emerging applications tend to have few I/O and memory side-effects, which limits the amount of information that needs checkpointing, and they allow discarding individual sub-computations with small qualitative impact. <b>Software</b> <b>recovery</b> can harness these properties in ways that hardware recovery cannot. We describe Relax, an architectural framework for <b>software</b> <b>recovery</b> of hardware faults. Relax includes three core components: (1) an ISA extension that allows software to mark regions of code for <b>software</b> <b>recovery,</b> (2) a hardware organization that simplifies reliability considerations and provides energy efficiency with hardware recovery support removed, and (3) software support for compilers and programmers to utilize the Relax ISA.

40|$|As {{transistor}} technology scales ever further, hardware reliability {{is becoming}} harder to manage. The effects of soft errors, variability, wear-out, and yield are intensifying {{to the point}} where it becomes difficult to harness the benefits of deeper scaling without mechanisms for hardware fault detection and correction. We observe that the combination of emerging applications and emerging many-core architectures makes <b>software</b> <b>recovery</b> a viable and interesting alternative to traditional, hardware-based fault recovery. Emerging applications tend to have few I/O and memory side-effects, which limits the amount of information that needs checkpointing, and they allow discarding individual sub-computations with typically minimal qualitative impact. <b>Software</b> <b>recovery</b> can harness these properties in ways that hardware recovery cannot. Additionally, emerging many-core architectures comprised of many simple, in-order cores pay heavily in terms of power and area for hardware checkpointing resources. <b>Software</b> <b>recovery</b> can be more efficient while it simultaneously simplifies hardware design complexity. In this paper, we describe Relax, an architectural framework for <b>software</b> <b>recovery</b> of hardware faults. We describe Relaxâ€™s language, compiler, ISA, and hardware support, develop analytical models to project performance, and evaluate an implementation of the framework on the compute kernels of seven emerging applications. Applying Relax to counter the effects of process variation, we find that Relax can enable a 20 % energy efficiency improvement for more than 80 % of an applicationâ€™s execution with only minimal source code changes. ...|$|E

40|$|In modern safety-critical {{embedded}} systems reliability and performance are two important criteria. In many systems based on off-The-shelf processors software implemented error recovery {{is the only}} option to improve {{the reliability of the}} system. However, software methods typically introduce large performance overheads. Another important factor in error recovery schemes is the recovery time, especially in systems with real-Time requirements. A key observation that helps improve <b>software</b> <b>recovery</b> methods is that only a defined number of locations in the program are susceptible to errors. In this paper we propose a fast <b>software</b> <b>recovery</b> scheme that instruments the program only at locations vulnerable to control-flow errors. We use a systematic bit-flip analysis to identify the exact locations susceptible to control-flow errors in a given program. This helps us to instrument the code with minimal overheads, while maintaining high-level of correct-Ability and low recovery times. Our experiments show that using the result of our bit-flip analysis and limiting the code instrumentation to only the susceptible locations improves the efficiency by a factor of 80 when compared to the latest control-flow error recovery methods...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, six {{hierarchical}} analytic {{models are}} developed {{to evaluate the}} performance and availability of mobile networks, especially {{for the next generation}} of networks based on the Third Generation Partnership Project IP Multimedia Subsystem. Three hierarchical analytic models are developed for the independent <b>software</b> <b>recovery</b> scheme, whereas the other three are proposed for the dependent <b>software</b> <b>recovery</b> scheme. The top level model (described by a reliability block diagram) captures the signaling system consisting of a series of servers in the core network. Each server in the network is modeled in the lower level with alternatives based on (binary) fault tree, multi-state fault tree, stochastic reward net and parallel multi-state systems, the last one solved by the universal generating function methodology. The steady-state system availability is computed to evaluate whether the required performance level is satisfied or not. The accuracy of these models is compared to cross-validate each other. Moreover, the models are compared with respect to the execution time and different input parameters. The influences of the performance demand and redundancy configuration on the system steady-state availability are also evaluated to provide the optimal redundancy configurations for signaling servers, while maintaining high system availability and minimizing the cos...|$|E

The rollback mechanism {{is based on}} the hardware recovery block which is a hardware equivalent to the <b>software</b> <b>recovery</b> block. The hardware recovery block is constructed by consecutive state-save operations and several state-save units in every processor and memory module. When a fault is detected, the multiprocessor reconfigures itself to replace the faulty component and then the process originally assigned to the faulty component retreats to one of the previously saved states in order to resume fault-free execution. A mathematical model is proposed to calculate both the coverage of multi-step rollback recovery and the risk of restart.
