5000|$|The <b>steering</b> <b>is</b> <b>operated</b> by a {{rack and}} pinion system which {{normally}} only works as a feedback loop.|$|E
50|$|<b>Steering</b> <b>is</b> <b>operated</b> {{through a}} worm gear fixed to the {{steering}} column. It engages with teeth on a projecting arm which operates a rod in the usual manner. Ball sockets are fitted to the various knuckle joints.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} {{different}} types of ship in Ancient Egypt, the reed boat and the vessel made from large wooden planks. The planked ships were the one that created the naval fleet and gave it its fierce reputation. These early ships lacked an internal rib to support them. Each boat had a designated section, generally under the main deck, where the slave rowers would sit. The <b>steering</b> oar <b>was</b> <b>operated</b> by one man.|$|R
50|$|Powered by a Gardner Marine 8L3B {{long stroke}} {{reciprocal}} diesel engine, has a cruising speed of 9 knots. One of very few vessels {{to use a}} twin rudder system, she steers from her bow whilst going astern using a fore rudder, and conventionally steers from a large stern rudder when steaming ahead. Her <b>steering</b> gear <b>is</b> <b>operated</b> by chains and spliced wire driving the two large cast iron quadrants from her opposing geared ships wheel, an original feature of the vessel.|$|R
50|$|The {{shaft of}} the <b>steering</b> control <b>was</b> {{connected}} {{directly to the}} track rods controlling the front wheels, resulting in approximately one-third of a turn from the left extreme to the right extreme ("lock to lock"). The handlebar-shaped <b>steering</b> control would <b>be</b> <b>operated</b> with small, controlled inputs by swivelling the steering bar about its axis from the horizontal (straight-ahead) position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel.|$|R
25|$|Despite this, the Aura {{has a few}} criticisms. The Aura's {{interior}} {{has been}} criticized for using cheap materials. Also, the <b>steering</b> wheel has <b>been</b> criticized for being too big for some drivers and that rear headroom was tight when equipped with the optional sunroof. The Aura was also criticized for being noisy over bumps and its lack of a rear armrest and head restraint, and that the push button controls on the <b>steering</b> wheel cannot <b>be</b> <b>operated</b> while holding the wheel. Robert Cumberford of Autombile magazine claimed that the Aura is a good car watered down by GM's cost cutting department.|$|R
40|$|This project aims at {{studying}} the designing {{of the steering}} system of an ATV (All Terrain Vehicle). The <b>steering</b> system <b>is</b> the most vital element in any automobile. It helps the driver in obtaining complete control on the manoeuvring of the vehicle. Since the <b>steering</b> system <b>is</b> directly <b>operated</b> by the driver {{it is essential to}} take human comfort into consideration while designing the steering. The effort required by the driver in handling the <b>steering</b> <b>is</b> an important factor. The <b>steering</b> system <b>is</b> in direct contact with the tyres hence it is subjected to extensive forces. Hence it is imperative that the design is tested for failure under such conditions. In this project we have modified the steering system implemented in Maruti Suzuki Esteem to meet our design requirements. We have successfully tested our steering mechanism in the ATV (All Terrain Vehicle) fabricated in the workshop by obtaining values from the various calculations we performed. ...|$|R
5000|$|The crew {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} rowers, each having one oar, one on the stroke side (rower's right hand side) and one on the bow side (rower's lefthand side). As the name suggests, there is no coxswain on such a boat, and the two rowers must co-ordinate steering and the proper timing of oar strokes between themselves or by means of a <b>steering</b> installation which <b>is</b> <b>operated</b> by a foot from one of the rowers. The equivalent boat when it is steered by a cox is referred to as a [...] "coxed pair".|$|R
5000|$|The {{tank was}} steered by {{conventional}} tillers hydraulically actuating onto external brake discs. The discs worked via the epicyclic gearbox providing [...] "regenerative" [...] <b>steering.</b> The gearbox <b>was</b> <b>operated</b> motorcycle-style with a kick up/kick down [...] "peg" [...] on the left, which actuated electro-hydraulic {{units in the}} gearbox, the accelerator cable <b>was</b> <b>operated</b> by the right foot. In the turret, the loader was {{on the left and}} the gunner on the right of the gun with the commander situated behind the gunner. The suspension was of the Horstmann bogie type with large side plates to protect the tracks and provide stand-off protection from hollow charge attack.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Steering</b> <b>is</b> by worm and wheel. The <b>steering</b> box <b>is</b> {{fixed to}} the {{cylinder}} head and a long drop arm provides good leverage. The clutch uses a single plate and runs in oil.The 4-speed gearbox is a strengthened version of the 14/45 gearbox. It is assembled as a unit with the engine. It <b>is</b> <b>operated</b> by a right-hand change speed lever with reach adjustable for the driver. Gearbox lubrication is from the engine and automatic. Final drive is by spiral bevel ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Steering</b> <b>is</b> by a worm and nut system, its box {{raised to}} give a {{comfortable}} rake to the <b>steering</b> wheel. There <b>are</b> just the four brakes, one on each wheel [...] They are not compensated. The brakes <b>are</b> <b>operated</b> by rods. There is a hand lever by the driver's right which controls the rear brakes alone. The aluminium brake shoes are adjusted for wear by a wedge which opens or closes a fulcrum {{on one end of}} the shoe. The brake drums are enclosed.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} is by half-elliptical {{springs in}} front and behind, those at the back being underhung. The front springs are flat-set, held out-of-centre and shackled forward. Dampers are fitted front and back. The four-wheel brakes <b>are</b> cable <b>operated.</b> <b>Steering</b> <b>is</b> by Marles cam and roller.|$|R
50|$|The four-wheel brakes <b>are</b> <b>operated</b> hydraulically. They <b>are</b> {{designed}} on the Lockheed system. There {{is also a}} {{hand lever}} fitted with a sensibly shaped trigger to control the back brakes. The springs front and back are half-elliptical with oilite bearings and double-action hydraulic shock absorbers. The rear suspension like the frame passes below the axle. <b>Steering</b> <b>is</b> by worm and nut in a box held by a bracket to the frame.|$|R

40|$|Four-wheel car <b>steering</b> <b>is</b> {{modelled}} by a single-track {{model with}} nonlinear tire characteristics. A generic control law for robust decoupling of lateral and yaw motion by yaw rate feedback to front-wheel <b>steering</b> <b>is</b> derived. Ideal <b>steering</b> dynamics <b>are</b> achieved by velocity-scheduled lateral acceleration feedback to front-wheel steering. For robust yaw stabilization a velocity scheduled yaw-rate feedback to rear-wheel <b>steering</b> <b>is</b> given, {{by which the}} linearized system gets velocity independent yaw eigenvalues...|$|R
50|$|The {{infotainment}} {{system can}} also <b>be</b> <b>operated</b> via the touchpad with controller in the centre console and by LINGUATRONIC voice control. The operation of DISTRONIC and cruise control with control elements {{directly on the}} <b>steering</b> wheel <b>is</b> another new feature.|$|R
50|$|Power <b>steering</b> <b>is</b> available.|$|R
40|$|The current {{spaceborne}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar systems <b>are</b> <b>operated</b> to illuminate the scene along the satellite flying direction. However, in many cases, the interested areas are not parallel to the flying direction, so an innovative smart imaging mode is acquired, which can be employed for illuminating scene along a given direction. A novel three-axis attitude <b>steering</b> method <b>is</b> proposed for smart imaging mode. First, mathematical model of the attitude <b>steering</b> <b>is</b> built by considering the restrictive conditions of zero-Doppler centroid requirement and the position of interested area. Then, an iterative optimisation algorithm is designed to calculate the three-axis steering angles. Finally, experiment results using the satellite tool kit tool validate the proposed methods well, {{especially in the case}} of coastline imaging...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Steering</b> <b>is</b> {{a special}} {{reactive}} technique used in navigation of agents. The simplest form of reactive <b>steering</b> <b>is</b> employed in Braitenberg vehicles, which map sensor inputs directly to effector outputs, and can follow or avoid. More complex systems {{are based on}} a superposition of attractive or repulsive forces that effect on the agent. This kind of <b>steering</b> <b>is</b> based on the original work on boids of Craig Reynolds.By means of steering, one can achieve a simple form of: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Steering</b> <b>was</b> by {{rack and}} pinion, and {{although}} power <b>steering</b> <b>was</b> never offered, the car could be ordered {{with a number}} of extras, including central locking, power windows, sunroof (or full-length retractable canvas roof in the Soleil version) and even air conditioning.|$|R
50|$|<b>Steering</b> <b>was</b> by worm and wheel.|$|R
50|$|The car was {{equipped}} with advanced features, including pneumatic tyres and wheel <b>steering.</b> The engine <b>was</b> mounted transversely, with the flywheel rotating {{in the direction of}} travel. The water-cooled engine drove the rear wheels through a belt transmission. The belt was tensioned by moving the engine forward or backward in the frame. The <b>steering</b> wheel <b>was</b> on a vertical column {{on the right side of}} the car, such that it could only <b>be</b> <b>operated</b> by the driver's right hand.|$|R
