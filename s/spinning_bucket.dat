The question posed by Greene is this: [...] "Is space a human abstraction, {{or is it}} a physical entity?" [...] The key thought experiment is a <b>spinning</b> <b>bucket</b> of water, designed to make one think about what creates the force felt inside the bucket when it is spinning. The ideas of Isaac Newton, Ernst Mach, and Gottfried Leibniz on this thought experiment are discussed in detail.|$|E
50|$|Newton took {{space to}} be more than {{relations}} between material objects and based his position on observation and experimentation. For a relationist there can be no real difference between inertial motion, in which the object travels with constant velocity, and non-inertial motion, in which the velocity changes with time, since all spatial measurements are relative to other objects and their motions. But Newton argued that since non-inertial motion generates forces, it must be absolute. He used the example of water in a <b>spinning</b> <b>bucket</b> to demonstrate his argument. Water in a bucket is hung from a rope and set to spin, starts with a flat surface. After a while, as the bucket continues to spin, {{the surface of the water}} becomes concave. If the bucket's spinning is stopped then the surface of the water remains concave as it continues to spin. The concave surface is therefore apparently not the result of relative motion between the bucket and the water. Instead, Newton argued, it must be a result of non-inertial motion relative to space itself. For several centuries the bucket argument was considered decisive in showing that space must exist independently of matter.|$|E

Radius of the kinks is measured {{as a function of the}} spinning speed and the tilting angle. Stability consideration of the surface results in an explanation that the kink is a boundary between the inner unstable and outer stable regions. A simple cellular automata model also displays kinks at the stability boundary. Typeset using REVTEX 1 PACS number: 46. 10. +z, 47. 20. Ma, 47. 54. +r, 81. 05. Rm] Granular materials behave differently from any other familiar forms of matter. They possess both solid- and fluid-like nature and exhibit unusual dynamic behaviors, such as segregation, surface waves, heap formation and convection [1 – 5]. The surface of granular material in a <b>spinning</b> <b>bucket</b> is an example of such interesting phenomena. Vavrek and Baxter [6] showed that the surface shape of sand in a vertical <b>spinning</b> <b>bucket</b> can largely b...|$|E

Usually, pilgrims {{come from all over}} China-Tibet and {{traveling}} great lengths—an approximated distance from Los Angeles to San Francisco—without using any modern transportation such as cars, and trains. The buckets she carries are called “the <b>spinning</b> <b>buckets</b> of Scriptures”(转经桶), on whose surface the words from the Scriptures are imprinted. In order to be blessed by the Buddha upon arrival in Lhasa, Pilgrims are to walk around the Potala Palace and touch those buckets while mumbling the words of Scriptures.

In order to {{maintain}} this curved path, a centripetal force in towards the center is needed (similar to the tension in a string when <b>spinning</b> a <b>bucket</b> over your head). This is accomplished by a pressure gradient outward (higher pressure outside than inside).|$|R

In 1870 the elaborate Victorian and Shaker architectural Ministry shop {{was built to}} house the community's religious leaders. To support itself, the community made brooms, <b>buckets,</b> <b>spinning</b> wheels, tubs, dry measures and shirts. It also made and sold applesauce, maple syrup, herbs, medicines and seeds.|$|R
40|$|The {{surface shape}} of a <b>spinning</b> <b>bucket</b> of {{granular}} material is studied using a continuum model of surface flow developed by Bouchaud et al. and Mehta et al. An experimentally observed central subcritical region is reproduced by the model. The subcritical region occurs when a metastable surface becomes unstable via a nonlinear instability mechanism. The nonlinear instability mechanism destabilizes the surface in large systems while a linear instability mechanism is relevant for smaller systems. The range of angles in which the granular surface is metastable vanishes with increasing system size. Comment: 8 pages with postscript figures, RevTex, to appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|E
50|$|Standing out in Clarke's (and Newton's) {{response}} to Leibniz's arguments is the bucket argument: Water in a bucket, {{hung from a}} rope and set to spin, will start with a flat surface. As the water begins to <b>spin</b> in the <b>bucket,</b> {{the surface of the}} water will become concave. If the bucket is stopped, the water will continue to spin, and while the spin continues, the surface will remain concave. The concave surface is apparently not the result of the interaction of the bucket and the water, since the surface is flat when the bucket first starts to spin, it becomes concave as the water starts to spin, and it remains concave as the bucket stops.|$|R
40|$|The {{high demand}} for bagoong keeps the {{processing}} {{as one of}} the established industries of Region 1. Its presence in every home justifies its indispensability to the Ilocano cuisine. This prototyping project surfaced from an expressed need of one bagoong processor from Santa, Ilocos Sur. The designed machine has a capacity of 24 liters. It has several parts: a) a perforated cylindrical bucket with paddle which carries the fish substrate, b) a one-directional motor, hp capacity, c) the casing which houses the bucket and the motor, and d) its accessories: the electrical controls and faucets. The cylindrical <b>bucket</b> <b>spins</b> at an approximate speed of 1700 rpm. Three (3) models were constructed. To document the comparative performance per model, the ANOVA was done. All three models manifested significant results. From the usual squeezing time ranging from 30 to 45 minutes, then followed by another 15 minutes for bottling with the manual method, the firs...|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{relative}} motion {{at this stage}} is the greatest, {{the surface of the}} water remains flat, indicating that the parts of the water have no tendency to recede from the axis of relative motion, despite proximity to the pail. Eventually, as the cord continues to unwind, {{the surface of the water}} assumes a concave shape as it acquires the motion of the <b>bucket</b> <b>spinning</b> relative to the experimenter. This concave shape shows that the water is rotating, despite the fact that the water is at rest relative to the pail. In other words, it is not {{the relative}} motion of the pail and water that causes concavity of the water, contrary to the idea that motions can only be relative, and that there is no absolute motion. (This situation would correspond to diagram D.) Possibly the concavity of the water shows rotation relative to something else: say absolute space? Newton says: [...] "One can find out and measure the true and absolute circular motion of the water".|$|R
