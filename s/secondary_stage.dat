The theme of the tour was described as following the same linear chapters to that of the tour's supporting album Lemonade, with each rotation of the aforementioned 'Monolith' representing a new chapter of the show. Several music critics gave the show positive reviews, with a variety of publications praising both the tour's {{production and}} Beyoncé's performance and vocal abilities. The tour had a variety of notable opening acts, including a number of special guests joining prominent opener DJ Khaled on stage. Supporting acts also included artists signed to Beyoncé's own management company, Parkwood Entertainment, such as the duo CHLOE X HALLE, who were relatively unknown at the time.|$|E

25|$|The <b>secondary</b> <b>stage</b> {{most often}} occurs 10–30 days later, but can present {{up to six}} months later. The {{infection}} spreads to the lymph nodes through lymphatic drainage pathways. The most frequent presenting clinical manifestation of LGV among males whose primary exposure was genital is unilateral (in 2/3 of cases) lymphadenitis and lymphangitis, often with tender inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy because of the drainage pathway for their likely infected areas. Lymphangitis of the dorsal penis may also occur and resembles a string or cord. If the route was anal sex the infected person may experience lymphadenitis and lymphangitis noted above. They may instead develop proctitis, inflammation limited to the rectum (the distal 10–12cm) that may be associated with anorectal pain, tenesmus, and rectal discharge, or proctocolitis, inflammation of the colonic mucosa extending to 12cm above the anus and associated with symptoms of proctitis plus diarrhea or abdominal cramps.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} stage prostate cancer {{in both the}} primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>staging</b> setting can {{have a major impact}} on management. Until recently radiological staging has relied on computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear bone scans to evaluate the extent of disease. However, the utility of these imaging technologies has been limited by their sensitivity and specificity especially in detecting early recurrence. Functional imaging using positron-emission tomography with a radiolabeled ligand targeted to prostate-specific membrane antigen has transformed the prostate cancer imaging landscape. Initial results suggest that it is a substantial improvement over conventional imaging in the setting of recurrence following primary therapy by having a superior ability to detect disease and to do so at an earlier stage. Additionally, it appears that the benefits seen in the <b>secondary</b> <b>staging</b> setting may also exist in the primary staging setting...|$|R

During the Japanese shows in 1996, Carey donned a white suit and jacket, and featured three female back-up singers. Red spotlights were used throughout the performance, {{as well as some}} light dance routines. During her Rainbow World Tour, Carey wore a two piece outfit, a pair of pants and top, with golden heels. Three back-up singers were provided, one male and two female, while Carey interacted with the front row fans. On her Adventures of Mimi Tour in 2006, Carey donned a pair of black leggings, worn with a bikini-like top. Wearing Christian Louboutin pumps, Carey sang on the arena's <b>secondary</b> <b>stage,</b> where she sang three of the set-list's titles. On her Elusive Chanteuse Show in 2014, Carey often used the song as her encore, entering the stage in a tight-fitted blue gown and black gloves.

500|$|Madonna first {{performed}} [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] {{during the}} promotional tours for Music. The first of these, was on November 5, 2000, at Roseland Ballroom in New York City, {{and the other}} on November 29, 2000, at Brixton Academy in London. Accompanying musicians performing with Madonna were; Mirwais Ahmadzaï on guitar and longtime backing singers Niki Haris and Donna DeLory. During the performance of New York, she wore a black tank top with [...] "Britney Spears" [...] written on it, along with cowboy hats and boots. The costumes for the show and the set was designed by Dolce & Gabbana. Roseland's <b>secondary</b> <b>stage</b> was used for the performance and was decked as a neo-Western wonderland, with bales of hay, yellow-lit horseshoes and silver cacti throughout the lobby and entrance. Dancers dressed as cowboys vogued during the pre-show in provocative poses, lassoing each other and skating around the passersby. The stage was draped in an American flag. As the music started, the flag lifted to reveal a white Ford pickup truck from which Madonna emerged, singing [...] "Impressive Instant". Bare-chested male dancers encircled her, as she posed on the hood of the truck and danced through the song. The vocoder effects on Madonna's voice was removed for the live performance, which Jennifer Vineyard from Rolling Stone felt made the singer's vocals sound [...] "less ridiculous". By the end of the performance, she as transported onto the main stage of Roseland, {{with the help of the}} audience member's hands. A similar performance was done at Brixton Academy; Madonna wore a different T-shirt, with her son Rocco and daughter Lourdes' names printed on it. Around 3,000fans attended the concert in London, which was streamed over the internet. More than nine million people watched the concert according to Nicky Price, a representative for Microsoft's MSN, the webcast's producer. It became the most-viewed webcast of all time, beating Paul McCartney's performance of [...] "50s rock and roll classics" [...] at Liverpool's The Cavern Club in December 1999, which was viewed by an audience of about three million.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the initial}} stage, or primary creep, or {{transient}} creep, the strain rate is relatively high, but decreases with increasing time and strain {{due to a}} process analogous to work hardening at lower temperatures. For instance, the dislocation density increases and, in many materials, a dislocation subgrain structure is formed and the cell size decreases with strain. The strain rate diminishes to a minimum and becomes near constant as the <b>secondary</b> <b>stage</b> begins. This {{is due to the}} balance between work hardening and annealing (thermal softening). The <b>secondary</b> <b>stage,</b> referred to as [...] "steady-state creep", is the most understood. The microstructure is invariant during this stage, which means that recovery effects are concurrent with deformation. No material strength is lost during these first two stages of creep.|$|E

The general <b>secondary</b> <b>stage</b> includes 3 years of education, whereas the secondary vocational track could be for 3–5 years. To enter the secondary level, the students must pass a national exam which is given at end of the <b>secondary</b> <b>stage.</b> As of year 2004 the 77.3 percent of students completing preparatory stage {{are estimated to be}} enrolled in secondary education. At this level, [...] students have formative and summative assessments [...] during the first year [...] and the average of the end of year national standardized exams for year two and three qualifies the students to take the Certificate of General Secondary Education-Thanawiya Amma, {{which is one of the}} requirements for admission into the universities.|$|E
2500|$|The {{characterized}} [...] "creep strain rate" [...] typically {{refers to}} the constant rate in this <b>secondary</b> <b>stage.</b> Stress dependence of this rate depends on the creep mechanism. In tertiary creep, the strain rate exponentially increases with stress because of necking phenomena or internal cracks or voids decreases the effective area of the specimen. Strength is quickly lost in this stage while the material's shape is permanently changed. The acceleration of creep deformation in the tertiary stage eventually leads to material fracture.|$|E
