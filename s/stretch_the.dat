5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates' {{bodies and}} {{appendages}} {{are covered with}} a tough cuticle made mainly of chitin and chemically hardened proteins. Since this cannot <b>stretch,</b> <b>the</b> animals must molt to grow. In other words, they grow new but still soft cuticles, then cast off the old one {{and wait for the}} new one to harden. Until the new cuticle hardens the animals are defenseless and almost immobilized.|$|E
5|$|As VT74 {{returns to}} the rural {{countryside}} it bends toward the northeast {{for most of the}} distance to Cornwall. Through this <b>stretch</b> <b>the</b> highway winds through forests and occasional farmland. VT74 straightens at an intersection with Bates Road. A connector road called North Palmer Road merges with VT74 shortly afterward. VT74 winds again for a stretch and straightens a second time near the intersection with Elmendorf Road as it continues toward Cornwall, intersecting with several township highways and approaching increasingly residential areas. At Clark Road in Cornwall, VT74 turns to the northeast once again, passing through more forests before terminating at VT30 in Cornwall.|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{simulations}} and {{an energy}} landscape analysis {{are used to}} examine <b>the</b> <b>stretching</b> of a model protein. A mapping of the energy landscape shows that <b>stretching</b> <b>the</b> protein causes energy minima and energy barriers to flatten out and disappear, and new energy minima to be created. The implications of these landscape distortions depend on the timescale regime under which <b>the</b> protein is <b>stretched.</b> When <b>the</b> timescale for thermally activated processes is longer than <b>the</b> timescale of <b>stretching,</b> <b>the</b> disappearances of energy barriers provide the mechanism for protein unfolding. When the timescale for thermally activated processes is shorter than <b>the</b> timescale of <b>stretching,</b> <b>the</b> landscape distortions influence <b>the</b> <b>stretching</b> process by changing the number and types of energy minima in which the system can exist...|$|R

5|$|The skins or {{heads of}} taiko are {{generally}} made from cowhide from Holstein cows aged {{about three or}} four years. Skins also come from horses, and bull skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To <b>stretch</b> <b>the</b> skin over the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks <b>stretch</b> <b>the</b> skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, tacks, called byō, are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; chū-daiko require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{stadium is}} {{projected}} to have an all-seated capacity of 8,005. It will comprise four stands; the East Stand (Main Stand), the West Stand, the North Stand and the South Stand. The three-floored East Stand is to accommodate hospitality guests, players, officials and the media, and will {{be connected to the}} adjacent retail and community facilities. The stands will <b>stretch</b> <b>the</b> length of the playing field, and each corner will host stadium facilities, including matchday emergency services, stewarding, groundsman accommodation, plant space and a fan zone.

By co-ordinating their operations, the assault forces would <b>stretch</b> <b>the</b> German defenders and hopefully gain the element of surprise. Covering the Inshore Squadron would be heavy bombardment from an offshore squadron of monitors and destroyers as well as artillery support from Royal Marine artillery near Ypres in Allied-held Flanders. Closer support would be offered by several flotillas of motor launches, small torpedo boats and Coastal Motor Boats which would lay smoke screens to obscure the advancing blockships as well as evacuate the crews of the cruisers after they had blocked the channel.|$|E

5|$|For a short <b>stretch,</b> <b>the</b> Colorado {{watershed}} {{meets the}} drainage basin of the Snake River, {{a tributary of}} the Columbia River, in the Wind River Range of western Wyoming. Southwest of there, the northern divide of the Colorado watershed skirts the edge of the Great Basin, bordering on the closed drainage basins of the Great Salt Lake and the Sevier River in central Utah, and other closed basins in southern Utah and Nevada. To the west in California, the Colorado River watershed borders on those of small closed basins in the Mojave Desert, the largest of which is the Salton Sea drainage north of the Colorado River Delta. On the south, the watersheds of the Sonoyta, Concepción, and Yaqui rivers, all of which drain to the Gulf of California, border that of the Colorado.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to <b>stretch</b> <b>the</b> bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the comets}} seen {{close to the}} Sun seem to have reached their current {{positions}} through gravitational perturbation of the Oort cloud by the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way. Just as the Moon's tidal force deforms Earth's oceans, causing the tides to rise and fall, the galactic tide also distorts the orbits of bodies in the outer Solar System. In the charted regions of the Solar System, these effects are negligible compared to {{the gravity of the}} Sun, but in the outer reaches of the system, the Sun's gravity is weaker and the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field has substantial effects. Galactic tidal forces <b>stretch</b> <b>the</b> cloud along an axis directed toward the galactic centre and compress it along the other two axes; these small perturbations can shift orbits in the Oort cloud to bring objects close to the Sun. The point at which the Sun's gravity concedes its influence to the galactic tide is called the tidal truncation radius. It lies at a radius of 100,000 to 200,000 AU, and marks the outer boundary of the Oort cloud.|$|E
