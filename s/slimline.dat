40|$|If {{there is}} still {{any doubt in your}} mind that {{interaction}} design could help you to more efficiently sell a product on the Internet this paper will convince you otherwise. In the month following the public release of the interface changes suggested in this paper in august 2008 the Internet based sports games company PowerChallenge saw an increase in sales of more than 60 % (see results). Using heuristic evaluation and simple user testing the complexity of accessing PowerChallenge’s products has been drastically reduced and this has resulted in fewer customers losing their way in the process. Along with <b>slimlining</b> the process of acquiring products the entire web portal has had a graphics remake to make a trustworthy first impression on users. The increased fear of phishing 1 and general uncertainty about the safety of online shopping[6] makes many users abandon their intentions of spending money whenever the site drastically changes it’s looks in the middle of the payment flow. This has been partially remedied but may require more work. An iterative design process has been applied throughout this project...|$|R
