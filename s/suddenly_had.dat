5|$|Mauretania was {{a client}} kingdom of Rome ruled by Ptolemy of Mauretania. Caligula invited Ptolemy to Rome and then <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> him executed. Mauretania was annexed by Caligula and {{subsequently}} {{divided into two}} provinces, Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis, separated by the river Malua. Pliny claims that division {{was the work of}} Caligula, but Dio states that in AD 42 an uprising took place, which was subdued by Gaius Suetonius Paulinus and Gnaeus Hosidius Geta, and the division only took place after this. This confusion might mean that Caligula decided to divide the province, but the division was postponed because of the rebellion. The first known equestrian governor of the two provinces was Marcus Fadius Celer Flavianus, in office in AD 44.|$|E
5|$|The {{decisive factor}} {{in favour of}} change in Chicago, however, was the {{economic}} slowdown in the early 1890s, which {{gave way to the}} financial panic of 1893. The recession, combined with the frantic building of the previous few years, meant that Chicago <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> a significant surplus of office space, threatening occupancy levels and rents. Regulation was introduced by the city council to control the problem in 1892, with support from the real estate industry who hoped to slow the construction of additional office space and shore up their diminishing profit margins. The height of new buildings was limited to , with lower height levels on narrower streets, effectively curtailing the construction of any taller skyscrapers.|$|E
5|$|Theo died in January 1891, {{removing}} Vincent's {{most vocal}} and well-connected champion. Theo's widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger was a Dutchwoman in her twenties {{who had not}} known either her husband or her brother-in law very long and who <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> {{to take care of}} several hundreds of paintings, letters and drawings, as well as her infant son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. Gauguin was not inclined to offer assistance in promoting Van Gogh's reputation, and Johanna's brother Andries Bonger also seemed lukewarm about his work. Aurier, one of Van Gogh's earliest supporters among the critics, died of typhoid fever in 1892 at the age of twenty-seven.|$|E

5|$|The Crown {{kept the}} {{freehold}} {{of the land}} south of the street except for No.79, which was granted to Nell Gwyn's trustees in 1676 or 1677 by Charles II. The buildings constructed {{on the south side}} of Pall Mall in subsequent years were grander than those on the north owing to stricter design and building standards imposed by the crown commissioners. When the main road was relocated further north, some houses <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> their backs facing the main road, losing available land for gardening. In 1664, residents filed a petition to turn the old road into gardens, which was successful. The trustees of the Earl of St Albans received a sixty-year lease on most of this from April 1665 so that trustees could issue sub-leases to their tenants.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, in 1891, Rappe wrote {{a memorandum}} that explained {{in more detail}} the budget, which <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> risen to 4.5 million kronor, and would finance the construction of two strongholds at Paglaberget and Åberget {{with a total of}} six long cannon, ten howitzers and eight quick-firing cannon, all in armoured turrets, along with machine guns and bunkers, barracks and supply depots. The plan included a reserve battalion of 1,000 men, an artillery battalion of 600 men, an engineer company of 120 men, and supply and depot personnel. Axel Rappe's large study on the permanent fortifications of Swedena mandate given to him in 1882was published in 1892 and cemented the view that a central fortress was needed in Boden to support and supply troops gathering between the Lule River and the eastern border, alongside the strengthening of the coastal defences at Stockholm, Gothenburg and Karlskrona.|$|E
25|$|The Kangxi Emperor {{took power}} earlier than {{expected}} {{at the age}} of 14 in 1669. The emperor <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> Oboi arrested on 30 charges. Oboi was sentenced to death but it was reduced to imprisonment in consideration of his achievements. Some sources say that he displayed the many wounds on his body that had been received in the defense of Kangxi's great-grandfather Nurhaci, this act had apparently moved the Kangxi Emperor to pardon Oboi.|$|E

25|$|This had direct {{implications}} for the company at Kragujevac. The Yugo had been envisaged as an all-Yugoslav car; the alternator came from Slovenia, the plastics and the interior from factories in Croatia, and the seats and rear trunk-struts from Kosovo. The disintegration of the Yugoslav federation <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> supplies dry up at Kragujevac and production rates declined steeply. The Sana may well have established Yugo as a fixture in the United Kingdom market in the 1990s, but political developments left this prospect unrealized.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish Air Force {{underwent}} a rapid modernization from 1945. It {{was no longer}} politically acceptable to equip it with second-rate models. Instead, the Air Staff purchased the best it could find from abroad, e.g. P-51D Mustangs, De Havilland Mosquito NF.19 night fighters and de Havilland Vampires, and supported the development of top performance domestic models. When the Saab 29 Tunnan fighter was introduced around 1950, Sweden <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> planes that were equal {{to the best of}} the Royal Air Force, the Soviet Union's VVS, and the U.S. Air Force.|$|E
25|$|Erb {{always wanted}} to sing Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart roles, but it was during rehearsals for a Schreker work that he <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> to stand in as Belmonte in Die Entfuhrung. Erb was a very great Mozartian singer, and {{thereafter}} he played many roles, including Octavio, Belfiore, Tamino and Ferrando, as well as Belmonte. In 1918, shortly {{before the end of}} the war, the King of Bavaria bestowed on Erb (the last) title Königlich Bayerische Kammersänger. During the Rhine occupation early in 1919 Erb was touring the Rhine towns and in the Netherlands with St Matthew Passion. He was held up, returning, at Ingolstadt, and the Munich revolution had settled by the time of his return there.|$|E

25|$|Western Europe's {{industrial}} {{nations in the}} 1970s were hit by a global economic crisis. They had obsolescent heavy industry, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> to pay very high energy prices which caused sharp inflation. Some of them also had inefficient nationalized railways and heavy industries. In the important field of computer technology, European nations lagged behind the United States. They also faced high government deficits and growing unrest led by militant labour unions. There was an urgent need for new economic directions. Germany and Sweden sought to create a social consensus behind a gradual restructuring. Germany's efforts proved highly successful. In Britain {{under the leadership of}} Margaret Thatcher, the solution was shock therapy, high interest rates, austerity, and selling off inefficient corporations as well as the public housing, which was sold off to the tenants. One result was escalating social tensions in Britain, led by the militant coal miners. Thatcher eventually defeated her opponents and radically changed the British economy, but the controversy never went away as shown by the hostile demonstrations {{at the time of her}} death in 2013.|$|E
500|$|According to The Irish Times, [...] "Flame & Citron {{has sparked}} an emotive public debate in Denmark that has drawn {{all sorts of}} pseudo-experts out of the {{woodwork}} to debate the portrayal of the period and the two true-life figures".

Mikkelsen stressed that they were the first [...] "to do the original research, yet we <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> a lot of so-called experts telling us how it really was and how we were wrong". The actor affirmed not too much is known about the period and they hope it sparks the debate so [...] "people will research and think some more about it".|$|E

500|$|Following the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, {{students}} began {{to withdraw from}} the university in large numbers to enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. [...] The financial impact on the university had the potential to be devastating, but Tigert navigated the war years by making the university campus, dormitories and class rooms available for the training of U.S. Army Air Force flight crews. [...] Tigert kept the lights on, and the bills paid. [...] Veterans began to return to school with support from the GI Bill, and by the fall term of 1946, over seventy percent of the University of Florida's 7,000 students were returning World War II veterans. [...] Contributing to the shortage of facility space was the influx of new female students when the Florida Legislature reinstituted co-education in 1947. [...] The university <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> more students than its available housing and classroom space could serve.|$|E
500|$|... "Badlaa" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{inspired}} by stories of Indian fakirs. In fact, the episode's title means [...] "to retort" [...] or [...] "to revenge" [...] in Urdu.

He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> the thought, [...] "What if someone who {{came up to me and}} asked me for money was actually a bad guy." [...] Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power. He explained, [...] "My original idea was a beggar with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb inside your ear, and Chris Carter–and this is why he's Chris Carter–said 'No, no, no! I know what's even better.'" [...] Shiban later said that [...] "... one thing about this episode that I'm sort of proud is that people often have told me that it is the most disgusting thought that they ever had, that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite this assessment, {{the end of}} the show's {{fourth season}} saw Hahn grow closer to {{orthopedic}} surgeon Callie Torres, in a relationship dubbed [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes has stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry. And watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." [...] She has explained that in developing the relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be real– not some stunt to get people talking. [...] We wanted {{to see what would happen}} if a woman <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of season finale, with which After Ellen have noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." ...|$|E

500|$|Short Cuts {{was one of}} a trio of {{successive}} film appearances that boosted Moore's reputation. It {{was followed}} in 1994 with Vanya on 42nd Street, a filmed version of her ongoing Uncle Vanya workshop production, directed by Louis Malle. Moore's performance of Yelena was described as [...] "simply outstanding" [...] by Time Out, and she won the Boston Society of Film Critics award for Best Actress. Following this, Moore was given her first leading role, playing an unhappy suburban housewife who develops multiple chemical sensitivity in Todd Haynes' low-budget film Safe (1995). She had to lose a substantial amount of weight for the role, which made her ill, and she vowed never to change her body for a film again. In their review, Empire magazine writes that Safe [...] "first established [...] credentials as perhaps the finest actress of her generation." [...] The film historian David Thomson later described it as [...] "one of the most arresting, original and accomplished films of the 1990s," [...] and the performance earned Moore an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Actress. Reflecting on these three roles, Moore has said, [...] "They all came out at once, and I <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> this profile. It was amazing." ...|$|E

This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." [...] Before continuing with the storyline, the show's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything either, and write from a place where they didn't understand it. [...] I don't think they did it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike. I really think that they wanted to develop these two characters, and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of— I think they just have a chemistry together, as actresses, too. You could tell that in the room. They definitely have a chemistry." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the third}} season of Ellen, {{producers}} were becoming frustrated by the series' lack of focus and the lack of interest that the character Ellen Morgan displayed toward the standard sitcom tropes of dating and relationships. Disney boss Michael Eisner suggested that since the character showed no inclination toward dating, she should get a puppy. [...] "It was an indication of just how lost the show was that network executives would be excited by Ellen buying a puppy", said executive producer Mark Driscoll. It was this suggestion that gave writer Jonathan Stark the idea to give that working title to the episode, and it stuck. In the summer of 1996 DeGeneres and the show's other writers opened negotiations with ABC and its parent company, Disney, to have Ellen Morgan come out during season four. Word of the secret negotiations leaked in September of that year, sparking a storm of speculation as to whether the character, the actress, or both would come out. The LGBT media watchdog group Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) launched a [...] "Let Ellen Out!" [...] campaign, including an [...] "Ellen Watch" [...] website. Disney rejected the first draft of the script, with Disney executive Dean Valentine stating that it did not go far enough. Director Junger reported that Valentine said [...] "'If we're going to do it, let's do it.' Once he said to go as far as we could, it became great fun to write." [...] Once final approval from Disney was secured, ABC announced on March 3, 1997, that Ellen Morgan would be coming out. [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] went into production on March 7. Guest stars sought to be a part of the project. According to writer/producer Driscoll, [...] "Suddenly all these talented actors were lining up to be in the episode. It had a buzz around it that it would be an historic episode. When Oprah came on—and she was so wonderful and open and giving—it <b>suddenly</b> <b>had</b> this great weight to it." ...|$|E
