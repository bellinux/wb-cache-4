5|$|On January 31, 2014, a sing-along {{version of}} Frozen was {{released}} in 2,057 theaters in the United States. It featured on-screen lyrics, and viewers were invited to follow the bouncing snowflake and <b>sing</b> <b>along</b> with the songs from the film. After its wide release in Japan on March 14, 2014, a similar sing-along version of Frozen {{was released in}} the country in select theaters on April 26. In Japanese-dubbed versions, Japanese lyrics of the songs appeared on screen for audiences to <b>sing</b> <b>along</b> with the characters. A sing-along version of the film was released in United Kingdom on November 28, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{the song}} was a {{collaborative}} effort between Jackson, David Foster and Bill Bottrell. Andrae Crouch's Choir and Jackson engage in a back and forth chant as the song reaches its climactic finale. Jackson's intent {{was to create a}} song that was lyrically deep yet melodically simple, so the whole world, particularly non-English-speaking fans, could <b>sing</b> <b>along.</b> He conceptualized a song that had an emotional message.|$|E
5|$|A <b>sing</b> <b>along</b> {{edition of}} the film, hosted by Jordin Sparks, was {{released}} in select theaters on September 29 and October 2, 2010.

5|$|The {{tradition}} of Voviyo (wedding songs), sung by women during a Ros, {{is important to}} this community. The procedure is that an elderly lady, usually the yejman (wife of the master of ceremonies, who is known as yejmani) who knows the voviyos, leads the song {{while the rest of}} the women <b>sing</b> <b>along.</b> Only women whose husbands are still living may sing. In ancient times, the wedding songs expressed very lofty sentiments and gave vent to the feelings of the people about the marriage partners and their families, invoking the blessing of God on them.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, it was {{announced}} that Talbot had signed a contract with Data Design Interactive for production of a video game on the Wii console. The game was to feature 15 songs from Over the Rainbow, allowing players to <b>sing</b> <b>along</b> with a computer-generated image of Talbot or against other players in a karaoke mode. Talbot re-recorded the album for the game. The game was scheduled for release {{in the first quarter of}} 2009, and is called Connie Talbot: Over the Rainbow. The game has never been released, citing copyright issues on the songs used for it.|$|E
5|$|The Judy Garland Show was {{initially}} {{slated to be}} taped in New York City. The network initially offered the producer's job to Bob Banner, {{who was at the}} time producing a series for Garry Moore. Although he was interested, he declined to relocate from the West Coast. Bob Finkel, whose credits included shows for Dinah Shore and Andy Williams, was next approached but similarly refused to relocate. Veteran producer and director Bill Hobin, then heading up <b>Sing</b> <b>Along</b> with Mitch, was approached to produce and direct the program. Already based in the East, Hobin eagerly accepted. Unbeknownst to Hobin, George Schlatter had been lobbying on the West Coast for the producer job and was signed to produce. Ultimately Hobin bowed out of the producer slot and Schlatter became the producer while Hobin was retained to direct.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{primarily}} found {{fault with}} the game's length, as {{the bulk of}} the game's content can be completed in only a few hours. Will Tuttle of GameSpy questioned whether Harmonix limited the number of songs on release knowing {{that there would be a}} market for the game's downloadable content in the near future. The low number of songs, along with the new themed instrument controllers, were found to make the game an expensive proposition for those new to rhythm games. Due to the limited selection of songs on the disc, some critics questioned the specific inclusion of certain songs or the exclusion of more popular songs. Furthermore, critics claimed that the game's complete dedication to the Beatles, without the option for cross-compatibility with Rock Band or vice versa, can potentially lead to tedious play sessions with minimal variety, hampering the social nature of the game. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com considered that in attaching the Rock Band name to the game's title, there was a certain expectation on an expandable library of songs and interoperability with previous Rock Band titles, which The Beatles: Rock Band failed to meet. Some players coming from previous versions of Rock Band would consider the songs in The Beatles: Rock Band to lack technical challenge. However, the less difficult note tracks were seen to be a welcoming benefit for newcomers to the series as well as those attempting to <b>sing</b> <b>along</b> with the harmony portions of the game. For purist fans, some critics noted that the game purposely avoids certain aspects of the Beatles' history; former band members such as Pete Best or collaborators such as Billy Preston or Eric Clapton are never seen during gameplay. Concerning supplemental content, Hilary Goldstein of IGN felt the extra features could have been more substantial, especially in comparison to the additional material that accompanies the remastered CDs.|$|E

25|$|From 1961–1966, the American TV network NBC {{carried a}} karaoke-like series, <b>Sing</b> <b>Along</b> with Mitch, {{featuring}} host Mitch Miller and a chorus, which superimposed {{the lyrics to}} their songs {{near the bottom of}} the TV screen for home audience participation. The primary difference between Karaoke and sing-along songs is the absence of the lead vocalist.|$|E
25|$|The song {{became a}} {{favourite}} at Oasis's live performances. Noel encouraged {{the crowd to}} <b>sing</b> <b>along</b> and often kept quiet during the first chorus, allowing the fans instead to <b>sing</b> <b>along</b> while he played the song's guitar part. During the Dig Out Your Soul Tour, Noel Gallagher abandoned the song's previous, full-band live arrangement in favour of a much slower, primarily acoustic arrangement in a lower key (B major). From 2008 through Oasis's breakup, the song was performed by Gallagher on his Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar backed up by Gem Archer on electric guitar, and Chris Sharrock playing tambourine. On 11 and 12 July 2009, during performances of the song at London's Wembley Stadium, Gallagher didn't sing a word; instead, he stood back, played guitar, and allowed the crowd to sing the entire song. Since 2011, he has alternated between the acoustic version and the original arrangement when playing the song with his solo project, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.|$|E

Japanese drummer Daisuke Inoue was asked frequently by guests in the Utagoe Kissa, where he performed, to provide recordings of his performances so that they could <b>sing</b> <b>along.</b> Realizing the potential for the market, Inoue made a tape recorder-like machine that played songs for a 100-yen coin each.|$|E
