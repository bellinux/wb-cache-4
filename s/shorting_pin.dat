40|$|<b>Short</b> <b>pin</b> fins {{are often}} used to {{increase}} that heat transfer to the coolant in {{the trailing edge of}} a turbine blade.

40|$|For a probe-fed {{microstrip}} antenna, it {{is quite}} common to employ the cavity model to find the field distribution under the patch and other electrical properties. Therefore, a multiport analysis technique based on the cavity model is usually employed to predict the input impedance of a probe-fed microstrip antenna with <b>shorting</b> <b>pins.</b> However, this approach does not provide any information about the field distribution under the patch with the <b>shorting</b> <b>pins,</b> which is usually {{used to calculate the}} radiation properties of the patch antenna. In this study, <b>shorting</b> <b>pins</b> are considered as current sources with unknown amplitudes, and the field distribution under the patch is obtained as a linear superposition of the contributions from each source via cavity model. Then, the unknown current densities over the <b>shorting</b> <b>pins</b> are determined by implementing the boundary condition of the tangential electric field on the pins. This is a hybrid approach because the field distribution is calculated from the cavity model, and the current densities over the <b>shorting</b> <b>pins</b> are obtained from the point matching of the resulting field distributions over the shorting conductors. The input impedance results found from this approach agree extremely well with those obtained from the multiport analysis, which shows that the proposed approach predicts both the input impedance and the field distribution under the patch. In addition, since the feeding probe is also made of PEC, the electric field under the patch should satisfy the boundary condition on this conductor as well. In the application of the cavity model, this is always ignored, with the assumption that the source probe is too thin to affect the field distribution under the patch significantly. In this study, the boundary condition of the electric field is implemented over the source, and its effect on the field distribution, in turn on the resonant frequency, is demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Slots in {{metallic}} ground {{planes are}} very promising candidates for conformal antenna applications. However, a low-profile unidirectional antenna requires a back reflector {{close to the}} slot and the resulting stripline feed causes strong excitation of parallel-plate modes. In this contribution, we consider unidirectional reflector-backed slot configurations with parallel-plate mode suppression by shorting pins. Starting from a parametric study with respect to <b>shorting</b> <b>pin</b> location and back reflector distance, we present a stripline-fed rectangular slot element with radiation efficiency of more than 80 % and a bandwidth of about 5 % at centre frequency 10 GHz. A careful optimisation of <b>shorting</b> <b>pin</b> locations guarantees reliable parallel-plate mode suppression without deteriorating the slot radiation behaviour. Coupling coefficients between parallel and aligned rectangular slot elements are presented. For increased bandwidth applications, a bow-tie slot element with about 8 % bandwidth and radiation efficiency of close to 80 % is proposed...|$|E

40|$|A {{new class}} of dual mode {{microstrip}} fractal resonator is proposed and developed for miniaturization of the dual band bandpass filter. The perimeter of the proposed resonator is increased by employing fourth iteration T-square fractal shape. Consequently the lower resonant frequency of the filter is decreased without increasing the usable space. The self similarity of the usable structure enables it to produce the two degenerate modes which are coupled using the proper perturbation technique. The <b>shorting</b> <b>pin</b> is placed at the null in the surface current distribution {{at the center of}} the resonator. This <b>shorting</b> <b>pin</b> is coactively coupled to the resonant circuit of the resonator, effectively coupled to the lower degenerate mode and reduces the lower edge band resonant frequency. By adjusting the resonator dimensions and the size of the <b>shorting</b> <b>pin,</b> the resonant frequency and the out-of-band rejection around the transmission bands can be controlled to meet the design requirements. The simulated response of the designed filter has two transmission bands, the first band is from 2. 34 - 3. 65 GHz with resonant frequencies at 2. 47 GHz and 3. 55 GHz, the second band is from 4. 37 - 5. 324 GHz with resonant frequencies at 4. 5 GHz and 5. 13 GHz.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, <b>shorting</b> <b>pin</b> addition, one of {{the common}} {{bandwidth}} enhancement techniques, is performed on traditional circular disc microstrip antennas that have three different dielectric substrate thicknesses and designed in three different resonant frequencies. Numbers of added shorting pins and positions of these pins are changed in every step, systematically and different pin combinations are tried for three antennas that design parameters are present in literature. Later, optimal pin combinations that give the intended resonant frequencies and the largest bandwidths are determined. For these optimal combinations, by keeping the resonant frequencies constant, the bandwidths of the antennas are increased to % 1. 440, % 2. 780 and % 6. 024, respectively. Compared to measurement results in the literature, for bandwidths, significant improvements are obtained. At the same time, it is observed that the technique of <b>shorting</b> <b>pin</b> addition increases the bandwidths in higher percentages on thicker microstrip antennas. For three antennas, it is seen that all pin combinations give similar resonant frequency variations depended on pin positions...|$|E
