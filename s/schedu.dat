Unlike the traditional best effort data applications, multimedia applications require Quality of Service (QoS) support such as guaranteed bandwidth and bounded delay/jitter. The original 802. 11 standard {{does not take}} QoS into account. Hence to provide QoS support IEEE 802. 11 standard group has specied a new IEEE 802. 11 e standard.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{results on}} placement and communications minimization for systems of affine recurrence equations. We show how to classify the dependences {{according to the}} number and nature of communications they may result in. We give both communication-free conditions and conditions for an efficient use of broadcast or neighbor-to-neighbor communication primitives. Since the dependences of a problem can generally not be all communication-free, we finally introduce a heuristic to globally minimize the communications based on the classification of dependences. Keywords: parallelization techniques, localization optimization, communications minimization, systems of recurrence equations, loops. 1. Introduction Over the past years, many research works {{have dealt with the}} construction of efficient parallelizing compilers ([11], [21], [3], [1]). In this context loop parallelization techniques have been developed. The parallelization of a loop nest requires the determination of a <b>schedu</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper extends lottery scheduling, a proportional-share {{resource}} management algorithm, {{to provide the}} performance assurances present in traditional non-real time process schedulers. Proportional-share scheduling enables flexible control over relative process execution rates and provides load insulation among groups of processes using a ticket abstraction. We first show that a straightforward implementation of lottery scheduling does not provide the responsiveness for a mixed interactive and CPU-bound workload offered by the decay usage priority scheduler of the FreeBSD operating system. Moreover, standard lottery scheduling ignores kernel priorities used in the FreeBSD scheduler to reduce kernel lock contention. In this paper, we show how to use dynamic ticket adjustments to incorporate into a lottery scheduler the specializations present in the FreeBSD scheduler to improve interactive response time and reduce kernel lock contention. We achieve this while maintaining lottery <b>schedu</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a single server job queueing {{system with a}} Poisson arrival process, hyperexponentially distributed job service times, no job precedence constraints, nonpreemptive service and a look-ahead table of jobs. A lookahead heuristic is described which schedules jobs to minimize average job waiting time. This job placement algorithm is then compared to the standard FIFO, LIFO and SJF scheduling policies, which operate without look-ahead knowledge. We isolate situations where the benefits outweigh the expenses incurred by the look-ahead algorithm, and observe some theoretical considerations necessary for modelling this system. Keywords: discrete-event simulation, scheduling theory, single server queue. 1 Introduction Few theoretical and experimental results have been documentated which describe {{the utility of the}} dynamic knowledge of future job arrival times and service requirements in server systems. As a result, the extra knowledge about future jobs often is discarded when <b>schedu</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A well-studied {{problem in}} the {{electric}} power industry is that of optimally scheduling preventative maintenance of power generating units within a power plant. We show how these problems can be cast as constraint satisfaction problems and provide an "iterative learning" algorithm which solves the {{problem in the}} following manner. In order to find an optimal schedule, the algorithm solves a series of CSPs with successively tighter cost-bound constraints. For the solution of each problem in the series we use constraint learning, which involves recording additional constraints that are uncovered during search. However, instead of solving each problem independently, after a problem is solved successfully with a certain cost-bound, the new constraints recorded by learning are used in subsequent attempts to find a schedule with a lower cost-bound. We show empirically that on a class of randomly generated maintenance scheduling problems iterative learning reduces the time to find a good <b>schedu</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In a joint project, BBN and Kestrel Institute have {{developed}} a prototype of a mixed-initiative scheduling system called ITAS (In-Theater Airlift Scheduler) for the U. S. Air Force, Pacific Command. The system was built in large part using the KIDS (Kestrel Interactive Development System) program synthesis tool. In previous work for the ARPA/Rome Laboratory Planning Initiative (ARPI), Kestrel has used their program transformation technology to derive extremely fast and accurate transportation schedulers from formal specifications, as much as several orders of magnitude faster than currently deployed systems. The development process can produce highly efficient code along with a proof of the code's correctness. This paper describes the current prototype ITAS system and its scheduling algorithm, as a concrete example of a generated scheduling working on a real problem.

The study {{was carried out by}} considering our claim that both a compiler should be directly involved in detecting processes of a program to run in parallel on a distributed system, and that a distributing operating system, in particular global scheduling should provide a support for such parallel execution. For this purpose, first of all the issues of parallelism of a program's processes has been examined. Issues such as the granularity of parallelism, use of parallelism, the generality of parallelism and the programmer's actions when writing parallel programs have been addressed. Possible future developments are then presented. Following this a support for parallel execution in distributed systems has also been discussed. In particular the issues of interprocess communication, process synchronisation, memory management, process management including global <b>schedu</b> [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Virtually all {{previous}} research in on-line algorithms {{has focused on}} single-threaded systems where only a single sequence of requests compete for system resources. To model multi-threaded on-line systems, we de ne and analyze the k-client problem, a dual of the well-studied k-server problem. In the basic k-client problem, {{there is a single}} server and k clients, each of which generates a sequence of requests for service in a metric space. The crux of the problem is deciding which client's request the single server should service rather than which server should be used to service the current request. We also consider variations where requests have non-zero processing times and where there are multiple servers as well as multiple clients. We evaluate the performance of algorithms using several cost functions including maximum completion time and average completion time. Two of the main results we derive are tight bounds on the performance of several commonly studied disk <b>schedu</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the online {{video on demand}} problem, namely having to accept or reject {{a request for a}} movie without knowing the future requests. We present online movie-scheduling schemes that implement the principles of refusal by choice and delayed notification. A novel way to schedule movies that exploits the knowledge of the distribution of the preference of requests for movies, is shown to have a competitive ratio that outperforms all the previously known schemes in practical situations. In fact, our scheduler has a competitive ratio bounded above by a constant, independent of the number of the users, channels, or movies, in the case that a large fraction of the requests tends to concentrate in a small number of movies. We extend our approach by presenting an "adaptive" randomized scheduler which initially is not aware of the movie popularities but it adapts to it, and achieves a similar asymptotic competitive ratio.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} implementation of a tool for applying rate monotonic scheduling (RMS) technology in distributed environments that serve real-time applications. Our tool, DRMS, enables users to define sets of real-time tasks and the processors to which the tasks will be allocated. The tool finds allocations such that real-time constraints of the tasks are guaranteed. Several feasibility tests can be applied by users in order to evaluate the feasibility of task allocations. Users can vary the descriptions of tasks and processors so that DRMS is a practical tool for designers of real-time systems.
