60|$|The clock ticked, {{the wind}} sighed, {{the woman at}} his <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> {{motionless}} for many minutes.|$|R
50|$|On the station's {{northern}} <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> a parcel's {{dock and}} siding. This was removed in August 1990.|$|R
60|$|The lads {{peered through}} the hedge. Far across the field, on the bank, the other <b>side,</b> <b>lay</b> {{what looked like a}} bundle of clothes.|$|R
5000|$|... the Sveta Gera (Trdina Peak) in the Žumberak Mountains, {{with the}} Slovenian Army occupying barracks that {{according}} to the Croatian <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> partially in Croatian territory; ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{this point}} {{the history of the}} club becomes quite convoluted, with a number of <b>sides</b> <b>laying</b> claim to some part of the {{heritage}} of Dresdner SC: ...|$|R
5000|$|... the Sveta Gera (Trdina Peak) in the Žumberak Mountains, {{with the}} Slovenian Army occupying barracks that {{according}} to the Croatian <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> partially in the Croatian territory ...|$|R
60|$|He rose, {{his face}} showing {{evidence}} of suffering, and bowed gravely. Hetty Hewitt {{walked over and}} stood by his <b>side,</b> <b>laying</b> her hand gently upon his arm.|$|R
60|$|Pippin had finished. His {{forehead}} {{rested on}} the table, his arms hung at his sides; he was stone-dead! His face wore a smile, and by his <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> an empty laudanum bottle.|$|R
60|$|He {{had reached}} a little niche or nest in the hillside, and stopped and {{suddenly}} drew aside a blanket. Beneath it, <b>side</b> by <b>side,</b> <b>lay</b> Flip and Lance, dead, with their cold hands clasped in each other's.|$|R
60|$|They {{went up to}} {{the window}} of the upper hall whence they could look down upon the {{approach}} to the house. The drive and the fields on either <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> quiet and still, bathed in the peaceful moonlight.|$|R
50|$|To make a Welch rabbit, {{toast the}} bread on both sides, then toast the cheese on one <b>side,</b> <b>lay</b> {{it on the}} toast, and with a hot iron brown the other side. You may rub it over with mustard.|$|R
60|$|The courtier was bending down, {{and by the}} {{creaking}} sound that reached him Ercole guessed his occupation to be the winding of the arbalest string. On the table at his <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> a quarrel swathed in a sheet of paper.|$|R
60|$|By degrees {{the smoke}} melted away, {{and there on}} the ground were the ten or twelve crooked pieces of ebony that they had seen consumed, now to all {{appearance}} quite untouched by the flame. There too on their farther <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> Menzi, shining with perspiration, and in a swoon or sleeping.|$|R
60|$|Pamela {{opened her}} eyes the next morning upon a {{distinctly}} pleasing sight. At the foot of her bed was an enormous basket of pink carnations. On the counterpane by her <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> a smaller cluster of twelve very beautiful dark red Gloire de Dijon roses. Attached to these latter was a note.|$|R
6000|$|At last {{we opened}} Malta, an island, or rather a city, {{like no other}} in the world. The seaport, {{formerly}} the famous Valetta, {{comes down to the}} sea-shore. On the one <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> the [Knights], on the other <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> the Turks, who finally got entire possession of it, while the other branch remained {{in the power of the}} Christians. Mutual cruelties were exercised; the Turks, seizing on the survivors of the knights who had so long defended St. Elmo, cut the Maltese cross on the bodies of the slain, and, tying them to planks, let them drift with the receding tide into the other branch of the harbour still defended by the Christians. The Grand-Master, in resentment of this cruelty, caused his Turkish prisoners to be decapitated and their heads thrown from mortars into the camp of the infidels.[490] ...|$|R
60|$|But Harry soon {{thought he}} found where the fault <b>lay,</b> and, <b>adjusting</b> a screw or two, {{he tried the}} key again. This time his call was answered.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{symbols of}} the club are the green and white colours in a broken shield. In the white <b>side</b> <b>lays</b> a black laurel with golden fruits, with two flowers of a first quarter and the Sun, everything in golden. In the green side, a lion in golden next to the initials SCL, also in golden.|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "Caroline" [...] {{received}} the blast like a stout and buoyant ship, yielding readily to its impulse, until her <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> nearly incumbent on the element {{in which she}} floated; and then, as if the fearful fabric were conscious of its jeopardy, it seemed to lift its reclining masts again, struggling to work its way heavily through the water.|$|R
60|$|He {{led the way}} to one of the neatest of {{the plank}} cottages, which stood on the highest ridge of the island, so that from the front windows it {{commanded}} a view of the great blue ocean with its breakers that fringed the reef as with a ring of snow, while, on the opposite <b>side,</b> <b>lay</b> the peaceful waters and islets of the lagoon.|$|R
60|$|The Wieroos salaamed and withdrew, {{closing the}} door behind them. He Who Speaks for Luata grasped a sword nervously in his right hand. At his left <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> the second weapon. It was evident that he lived in {{constant}} dread of being assassinated. The fact that he permitted none with weapons within his presence and that he always kept two swords at his side pointed to this.|$|R
60|$|On each <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> shallow {{sheets of}} {{stagnant}} water overlying a treacherous bottom of semi-fluid mud, which {{rose above the}} surface {{here and there in}} moist, sweltering banks, mottled over with occasional patches of unhealthy vegetation. Great purple and yellow fungi had broken out in a dense eruption, as though Nature were afflicted with a foul disease, which manifested itself by this crop of plague spots.|$|R
60|$|Our coach rattled {{out of the}} city, and at a short {{distance}} from its outskirts passed over a bridge of elegant construction, but somewhat too slight, as I imagined, to sustain any considerable weight. On both <b>sides</b> <b>lay</b> an extensive quagmire, which {{could not have been more}} disagreeable either to sight or smell, had all the kennels of the earth emptied their pollution there.|$|R
50|$|To make an English rabbit, {{toast the}} bread brown on both <b>sides,</b> <b>lay</b> it in a plate before the fire, pour {{a glass of}} red wine over it, and let it soak the wine up. Then cut some cheese very thin and lay it very thick over the bread, put it in a tin oven before the fire, and it will be toasted and browned presently. Serve it away hot.|$|R
5000|$|In 1894 the {{buildings}} were described as forming a small quadrangle with a lawn and trees in the centre. On the north <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> the residences of the [...] "sisters" [...] (four under one roof). Exactly opposite, on the south side, was the chapel. The warden's house, on the west, faced the [...] "brothers'" [...] residences on the east - the latter being an exact counterpart of those of the [...] "sisters".|$|R
50|$|After World War II, Berlin {{was divided}} in four Allied sectors. While {{the street and}} the {{sidewalk}} of the Bernauer Straße lay in the French sector of West Berlin, the frontage of the buildings on the southern <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> in the Soviet sector of East Berlin. Until 13 August 1961, the day the Berlin Wall was built, Siekmann crossed the sector’s border just by leaving her house. Her sister's apartment was also in the French sector of West Berlin.|$|R
6000|$|... "And mine’s there too," [...] ses Peter Russet, {{speaking}} a’most afore old Sam ’ad finished; [...] "side by <b>side</b> they <b>lay</b> in the harbour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go to; {{thou art}} {{not used to}} be so late from thy pillow, my poor Ruth; sleep hath come over thee, whilst {{standing}} on thy watch. Some cloud hath left its shadow on the fields, or, truly, {{it may be that the}} hunt did not drive the beasts as far from the clearing as we had thought. Come; since thou wilt cling to my <b>side,</b> <b>lay</b> hand on the bridle of the horse, while I ease him of his burthen." ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{the stone}} slab {{floor of the}} low living-room Tant Mettie lay dead. Her body was pierced through by innumerable thrusts, which I somehow instinctively {{recognised}} as assegai wounds. By her <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> Sannie, the little prattling girl of three, my constant playmate, whom I had instructed in cat's-cradle, and taught the tales of Cinderella and Red Riding Hood. My hand grasped the lollipops in my pocket convulsively. She would never need them. Nobody else was about. What had become of Oom Jan Willem--and the baby? ...|$|R
60|$|Nor {{could he}} ascertain, nor perhaps would she herself examine, on which <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> her heart of hearts. The proof had come {{whether she would}} abide by her pledge to him to accept the care of us in his absence. When he asked it, it had not {{occurred}} to him that it might be a renunciation of marriage. Now he perceived that so it had been, but she kept her counsel and so did he. We others never guessed at what was going on between those two.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>sides</b> <b>lay</b> {{claim to}} the {{tradition}} of the earliest club named Union Solingen, founded in 1897 out of the merger of a number of clubs from the district of Ohligs in Solingen. Over time these would include Ohligs FC 06, VfR Ohligs, Walder Ballspielverein, and BV Adler Ohligs. Of these clubs, only VfR Ohligs would distinguish itself with any time spent in first division football when they played the 1940-41 season in the Gauliga Niederrhein before being relegated after a last place result.|$|R
60|$|The first {{warning was}} {{the firing of}} rifles from the peninsula, where Brown and his two Raiateans signalled the retreat and {{followed}} the besiegers through the jungle to the beach. From the eyrie {{on the face of}} the rock Grief could see nothing for another hour, when the Rattler appeared, making for the passage. As before, the captive Fuatino men towed in the whaleboat. Mauriri, under direction of Grief, called down instructions to them as they passed slowly beneath. By Grief's <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> several bundles of dynamite sticks, well-lashed together and with extremely short fuses.|$|R
50|$|In the Late Middle Ages, {{the village}} {{was made up of}} two centres: Stebeshusen lay on the Kehrbach’s left bank and belonged to the high court region of Rhaunen, and over on the other <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> Smer(le)bach, which had its first {{documentary}} mention in 1325, and which formed together with the village of Asbach a court region of its own. Upon the 1515 partition of the Waldgraviate-Rhinegraviate, Smerlebach, which was also known as the court region of Stipshausen, passed to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Kyrburg and thereafter belonged to the Amt of Wildenburg.|$|R
25|$|During 2008 the United Kingdom {{announced}} plans to pay Taliban fighters to switch <b>sides</b> or <b>lay</b> down arms; the proceeding year the U.K. government supported negotiations with the Taliban.|$|R
60|$|The old woman, who {{appeared}} to have been subdued by exhaustion, crept {{on her hands and knees}} to her <b>side,</b> and <b>laying</b> her head on her daughter's breast, moaned piteously.|$|R
6000|$|The ineptness of {{retaining}} him at her <b>side</b> <b>lay</b> {{not only}} in the fact itself of injury to him, but in the likelihood of his living to see it as such, and reproaching her for selfishness in not letting him go in this unprecedented opportunity for correcting a move proved to be false. He wished to examine the southern heavens--perhaps his uncle's letter was the father of the wish--and there was no telling what good might not result to mankind at large from his exploits there. Why should she, to save her narrow honour, waste the wide promise of his ability? ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Otter {{collected}} their baggage, {{which consisted}} chiefly of the hide {{line and the}} spear, and they crawled forward up the snow-slope. Some twenty or thirty yards ahead of them, and almost <b>side</b> by <b>side,</b> <b>lay</b> the two glacier stones on which they had passed the bridge, and near them those which Otter had despatched as pioneers on the previous morning. They looked at them wondering. Who could have believed that these inert things, not an hour before, had been speeding down the icy way quicker than any express train that ever travelled, and they with them? ...|$|R
