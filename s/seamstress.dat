5|$|His parents' {{marriage}} {{dissolved in}} July 1888, when Max Döblin eloped with Henriette Zander, a <b>seamstress</b> twenty years his junior, {{and moved to}} America {{to start a new}} life. The catastrophic loss of his father was a central event in Döblin's childhood and would be formative for his later life. Shortly thereafter, in October 1888, Sophie and the five children moved to Berlin and took up residence in a small shabby apartment on the Blumenstraße in Berlin's working-class east. Döblin's parents briefly reconciled in 1889, when Max returned penniless from America; the family moved to Hamburg in April 1889, {{but when it came to}} light that Max had brought his lover back with him and was leading a double life, Sophie and the children returned to Berlin in September 1889.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, Rodin {{began to}} live with a young <b>seamstress</b> named Rose Beuret (born in June 1844), with whom he would stay– with ranging commitment– {{for the rest of his}} life. The couple had a son, Auguste-Eugène Beuret (1866–1934). That year, Rodin offered his first {{sculpture}} for exhibition, and entered the studio of Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, a successful mass producer of objets d'art. Rodin worked as Carrier-Belleuse' chief assistant until 1870, designing roof decorations and staircase and doorway embellishments. With the arrival of the Franco-Prussian War, Rodin was called to serve in the National Guard, but his service was brief due to his near-sightedness. Decorators' work had dwindled because of the war, yet Rodin needed to support his family; poverty was a continual difficulty for Rodin until about the age of 30. Carrier-Belleuse soon asked Rodin to join him in Belgium, where they would work on ornamentation for the Brussels Stock Exchange.|$|E
40|$|I hereby {{declare that}} I am the sole {{author of this}} thesis. This is a true copy of the thesis, {{including}} any required final revisions, as accepted by my examiners. I understand that my thesis may be made electronically available to the public. ii This thesis involves both editorial practice and literary analysis. In order to establish an editorial framework for the electronic scholarly edition of Dr. Ralph Barnes Grindrod’s pamphlet Slaves of the Needle, I examine current issues in electronic textual editing. In the electronic scholarly edition, approximately twelve of the pamphlet’s thirty-five pages are transcribed and encoded using TEI-based code. The second aspect of my master’s thesis concerns the depiction of <b>seamstresses</b> in nineteenth-century British literature. Slaves of the Needle provides a non-fiction counterpart to the fictional <b>seamstresses</b> of mid-nineteenth-century literature. Using Slaves of the Needle {{as a basis for}} evaluating the accuracy of mid-nineteenth-century characterizations of <b>seamstresses,</b> I show that authors such as Charles Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell, Ernest Jones, and Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna were familiar with the working conditions of <b>seamstresses.</b> B...|$|R

5|$|In 1885, Helena {{made plans}} to move to New York in the United States to join her sister Lena and her husband. Goldman wanted to join her sister, but their father refused to allow it. Despite Helena's offer {{to pay for the}} trip, Abraham turned a deaf ear to their pleas. Desperate, Goldman {{threatened}} to throw herself into the Neva River if she could not go. He finally agreed, and on December 29, 1885, Helena and Emma arrived at New York City's Castle Garden, the entry for immigrants. They settled upstate, living in the Rochester home which Lena had made with her husband Samuel. Fleeing the rising antisemitism of Saint Petersburg, their parents and brothers joined them a year later. Goldman began working as a <b>seamstress,</b> sewing overcoats for more than ten hours a day, earning two and a half dollars a week. She asked for a raise and was denied; she quit and took work at a smaller shop nearby.|$|E
5|$|Irene Morales Infante (1 April 1865 – 25 August 1890) was a Chilean {{soldier who}} served in the War of the Pacific. She was born in a barrio of Santiago, and lived in poverty {{throughout}} her life, working as a <b>seamstress</b> from an early age. At the time the War of the Pacific began she was only 13 years old, and had been orphaned and twice widowed. Her second husband was executed by the Bolivian military for killing a soldier.

5|$|Knowles {{was born}} in Houston, Texas, to Mathew Knowles and Tina Knowles. Solange's older sister is singer Beyoncé. Her father, {{originally}} from Alabama, is African American, and her mother, originally from southern Louisiana, is Creole (with African, Native American, French, and 1/32 Irish ancestry). Her maternal grandparents are Lumis Beyincé and Agnéz Deréon, (a <b>seamstress).</b> She is also a descendant of Acadian leader Joseph Broussard. As a child, Knowles studied dance and theater. At the age of five, she made her singing debut at an amusement park. She began writing songs {{at the age of}} nine. At 13, she decided to pursue recording, but her parents initially advised her to wait. At the age of 15 Knowles replaced a departed dancer and performed with her sister's group Destiny's Child on tour. During the group's opening stint for American pop singer Christina Aguilera's tour, Knowles temporarily replaced Destiny's Child member Kelly Rowland after she broke her toes backstage during a costume change. When Knowles was 16, her father, who was then also her manager, signed her to his recording company, Music World Entertainment, along with Columbia.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to balance the production line and analyze the layout of the sewing sector in a furniture industry. Using the Arena software, a simulation model was constructed that represented the real system consisting of a cellular layout with 3 groups of 5 <b>seamstresses,</b> who produced 57 different types of products divided into three families, in a daily working day of 625 minutes in the months of February to August and 725 minutes in the months of September to January. The model was quantitatively validated among the managers of the studied industry. The obtained results allowed conclusions with an error of less than 1 % in the daily quantity of pieces produced with 99 % statistical confidence. Therefore, three scenarios related to the organization of the work environment and the balancing of the production line were constructed, and those include: i) linear layout, and the balancing allowed the division of five <b>seamstresses</b> for families 1 and 2, and three <b>seamstresses</b> for family 3; ii) study of the layout by processes, so that the best balance was constituted of two groups with seven seamstresses; iii) similar to scenario 2 but with six <b>seamstresses</b> in group 1 and seven <b>seamstresses</b> in group 2. It was verified that the modified, alternative scenario 2 is more advantageous for the organization, since it presents greater productivity compared to all other scenarios and to the real system, so the company can increase its production capacity by simply modifying the layout and organizing the work environment...|$|R
