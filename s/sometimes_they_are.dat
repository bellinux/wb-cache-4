5|$|<b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{referred}} to, in Latin, as magnus rotulus pipae. Several {{sources for}} the actual idea of making the rolls as rolls have been suggested, including Jews, Adelard of Bath, who was a royal clerk and was familiar with Arabic practices of using rolls, or the royal clerk Thurkil, who studied under a mathematician {{who may have been}} from Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the labial palpi are prominent, three-segmented, {{springing}} {{from under}} the head and curving {{up in front of}} the face. There is great variation in morphology of labial palpi in different families of Lepidoptera; sometimes the palpi are separate and <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> connivent and form a beak, but they are always independently movable. In other cases, the labial palpi may not be erect but porrect (projecting forward horizontally).|$|E
5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species have}} a hot to very acrid taste {{and can cause}} {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms. Despite this, such species are eaten in some regions, e.g. Lactarius torminosus in Finland or Russia. Often, they are parboiled or pickled to make them palatable, and <b>sometimes,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> used as spice, for example Russula emetica in Eastern Europe. Some species are however truly poisonous: the East Asian and North American Russula subnigricans causes rhabdomyolysis and is potentially lethal, and Lactarius turpis from Eurasia contains a mutagenic substance.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens are {{intelligent}} birds, {{and like}} many other corvids have innovative methods of seeking out food. Foraging {{takes place in the}} early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day. Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either finding objects while flying overhead, or by walking along and looking. However, they occasionally feed in trees—Australian ravens forage eucalypt foliage for Christmas beetles (Anoplognathus), and devote a substantial amount of time to look for nests and eggs to eat. They have also been known to take golf balls from fairways, possibly mistaking them for eggs. Ravens use their bill rather than their feet to explore or turn items on the ground (rocks or sticks) over, or hold or snatch food while flying. They have also been recorded using fence posts as anvils to bash snails against before eating them. Australian ravens most often eat food where they find it unless taking food back for nestlings. Occasionally they have been observed caching carrion or a killed animal in a hole nearby to store it. They can pack shredded meat in their mouth under their tongue. Australian ravens have adapted well to eating food scraps in urban areas, such as school playgrounds, rubbish tips, bins outside supermarkets or restaurants, abattoirs, piggeries and farmyards. In one isolated study, they were observed feeding on nectar from eucalypt flowers. Australian ravens sometimes forage in mixed-species flocks with any of the other four species of Australian corvids. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> aggressive with little ravens if both are at a food source and drive them off, though not if the smaller species greatly outnumbers the larger.|$|E
5|$|In Vedic literature, Mitra and Varuna {{are portrayed}} as icons of affection and {{intimate}} friendship between males (the Sanskrit word mitra means “friend” or “companion”). They are depicted riding a shark or crocodile together while bearing tridents, ropes, conch shells and water pots. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> portrayed seated side-by-side on a golden chariot drawn by seven swans. Ancient Brahmana texts furthermore associate Mitra and Varuna with the two lunar phases and same-sex relations: “Mitra and Varuna, on the other hand, are the two half-moons: the waxing one is Varuna and the waning one is Mitra. During the new-moon night these two meet {{and when they are}} thus together they are pleased with a cake offering. Verily, all are pleased and all is obtained by any person knowing this. On that same night, Mitra implants his seed in Varuna and when the moon later wanes, that waning is produced from his seed.” (Shatapatha Brahmana 2.4.4.19) Varuna is similarly said to implant his seed in Mitra on the full-moon night for the purpose of securing its future waxing. In Hinduism, the new- and full-moon nights are discouraged times for procreation and consequently often associated with citrarata or unusual types of intercourse.|$|E
60|$|There was, however, {{no lack of}} {{diplomatic}} banquets for the successor of Louise of Savoy. The splendid hotel of the Count of Ferroll {{was the scene of}} festivals not to be exceeded in Paris, and all in honour of this wondrous dame. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> feasts, <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> balls, <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> little dinners, consummate and select, sometimes large receptions, multifarious and amusing. Her pleasure was asked every morn, and whenever she was disengaged, she issued orders to his devoted household. His boxes at opera or play were at her constant disposal; his carriages were at her command, and she rode, in his society, the most beautiful horses in Paris.|$|R

25|$|Boats used in Gaelic Ireland include canoes, currachs, sailboats and Irish galleys. Ferryboats {{were used}} to cross wide rivers and are often {{mentioned}} in the Brehon Laws as subject to strict regulations. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> owned by individuals and <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the common property of those living round the ferry. Large boats were used for trade with mainland Europe.|$|R
25|$|The wells (which may be open dug wells or tubewells) have {{normally}} to be pumped, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{connected to}} drains for discharge by gravity.|$|E
25|$|The {{occasions}} when the dhak was played are changing. Apart from pujas or religious festivities, dhakis are also called {{to play in}} markets before Durga Puja when people crowd in large numbers. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> called for store inaugurations.|$|E
25|$|In Wallonia (Belgium) {{films are}} usually dubbed, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> played on two {{channels}} {{at the same}} time: one dubbed (on La Une) and the other subtitled (on La Deux), {{but this is no}} longer done as frequently due to low ratings.|$|E
60|$|<b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> fêted adventurers {{who were}} {{credited}} with having tramped {{over most of}} the globe. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> hoboes on whom straggly women shut farm-house doors.

5000|$|Later, Ace {{shifted to}} more broad {{contemporary}} concerns {{and called the}} column [...] "Top of My Head"; these essays became as well-read as his old radio show had been, without being either too frivolous or too overbearing. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> gentle; <b>sometimes,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> more tart, always <b>they</b> <b>were</b> without genuine malice. Often they included his beloved Jane, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> strongly enough received to provoke two published collections, The Fine Art of Hypochondria; or, How Are You? and The Better of Goodman Ace.|$|R
50|$|By {{those who}} made them, the {{lanterns}} were variously said to represent the spirits or supernatural beings, or were used to ward off evil spirits. For example, <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> used by Halloween guisers to frighten people, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> set on windowsills to keep harmful spirits out of one's home. It has also been suggested that the jack-o'-lanterns originally represented Christian souls in purgatory, as Halloween is the eve of All Saints' Day (1 November)/All Souls' Day (2 November).|$|R
25|$|Greenhouses {{are also}} {{sometimes}} included. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> also outfitted with irrigation systems or heat sink-systems which can respectively irrigate the plants or help to store {{energy from the}} sun and redistribute it at night (when the greenhouses starts to cool down).|$|E
25|$|Some {{species and}} many cultivars are widely {{grown in the}} garden in {{temperate}} and subtropical regions. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> also grown as potted plants. A large number of ornamental cultivars have been developed. They {{can be used in}} herbaceous borders, tropical plantings, and as a patio or decking plant.|$|E
25|$|The Danaids in South India are {{prominent}} migrants, between the Eastern Ghats and Western Ghats. Three species {{will be involved}} in this, namely Tirumala septentrionis, Euploea core, and Euploea sylvester. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> joined by lemon pansy (Junonia lemonias), common emigrant (Catopsilia pomona), tawny coster (Acraea terpsicore) and blue tiger (Tirumala limniace).|$|E
5000|$|The {{center of}} power shifted {{frequently}} between these smaller states or chieftainships. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unified under one strong leader, <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not. As the Shan scholar Sai Kam Mong observes: [...] "Sometimes one of these states strove to be the leading kingdom and sometimes {{all of them were}} unified into one single kingdom ... The capital of the kingdom shifted from place to place, but most of them were located near the Nam Mao river (the [...] "Shweli" [...] on most maps today)" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{coat of arms}} of the County of Dannenberg was {{emblazoned with}} lions rampart, {{sometimes}} separate, sometimes as a facing pair. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> also accompanied by a fir tree.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> {{not always}} bashful, it must <b>be</b> said. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> distressingly bold, {{and they came}} to the point of {{offensive}} warfare with a readiness and assurance which scared Josie. She {{had never seen anything like}} it.|$|R
25|$|Sirutteok is {{one kind}} of steamed tteok that are rice (맵쌀, maepssal in Korean) or glutinous rice (찹쌀 chapssal) and <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> mixed {{together}} with (but not limited to) other grains, beans (azuki beans or mung beans), sesame seeds, wheat flour, or starch can be mixed with the rice. Fruits and nuts are used as subsidiary ingredients.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{versions}} of the Actaeon myth survive, though many are fragmentary. The details vary but at the core, they involve a great hunter, Actaeon who Artemis turns into a stag for a transgression and who is then killed by hunting dogs. Usually, the dogs are his own, who no longer recognize their master. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> Artemis' hounds.|$|E
25|$|Punishment in Hell {{typically}} {{corresponds to}} sins committed during life. Sometimes these distinctions are specific, with damned souls suffering for each sin committed (see for example Plato's myth of Er or Dante's The Divine Comedy), but <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> general, with condemned sinners relegated {{to one or}} more chamber of Hell or to a level of suffering.|$|E
25|$|From medieval times, court Jews could amass {{personal}} fortunes {{and gained}} {{political and social}} influence. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> also prominent people in the local Jewish community and could use their influence to protect and influence their brethren. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the only Jews who could interact with the local high society and present petitions of the Jews to the ruler. However, the court Jew had social connections and influence in the Christian world mainly through his Christian patrons. Due to the precarious position of Jews, some nobles could just ignore their debts. If the sponsoring noble died, his Jewish financier could face exile or execution.|$|R
5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of buttons, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> used {{on the ends of}} the ribbons used to fasten clothing together. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> formed into small figures. Shakespeare calls this type of figure an [...] "aglet baby" [...] in The Taming of the Shrew.|$|R
50|$|The {{decoration}} of the margins was realised in various ways: <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> inserted {{in a different}} paper, (a tradition {{that appeared in the}} 15th century); sprinkled with gold, following a Chinese custom; or painted with colours or gold.|$|R
25|$|The Sam Browne belt was {{replaced}} by the brand new ballistic nylon police duty belt equipped with a standard issue Walther P99 or Px4 Storm handgun, two extra 10 round magazines, a pair of Hiatt Speedcuffs, a T-baton, a pepper spray, an LED torch and a walkie-talkie. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> equipped with a Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine-gun during special situations.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the time}} of the ancient Serer Lamanes, the Serer people have {{represented}} the axis of the world {{in the form of a}} stele, symbolizing the steles of Roog. In the Serer home, sometimes in the courtyard, they represent the most sacred place of the house servicing as the centre of gravity of divine energies and one of the poles of the coronation. In the home, these steles are made of wooden slabs, forming a sacred wood. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> raised steles supported by three rods and <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> just green trees. There symbolism can be celestial or terrestrial depending on the arrangement of rods that surround them. If there are twelve rods arranged in a circle, they symbolize the celestial world, four rods forming a square symbolizes the earthly world. They are always built based on the tenets of Serer symbolism, and form the family shrine devoted to the supreme being (see Serer ancient history).|$|E
25|$|In Anglican discourse, the Articles are {{regularly}} cited and interpreted to clarify doctrine and practice. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> used to prescribe support of Anglican comprehensiveness. An important concrete manifestation {{of this is}} the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral, which incorporates Articles VI, VIII, XXV, and XXXVI in its broad articulation of fundamental Anglican identity. In other circumstances they delineate the parameters of acceptable belief and practice in proscriptive fashion.|$|E
60|$|On and on they went, over soft {{patches of}} ground, through low bushes, and around rocks and fallen trees. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{close to the}} water's edge, and again they {{traveled}} almost {{out of sight of}} the clear-flowing stream.|$|R
2500|$|The {{history of}} the team name (Golden Hawks) {{dates back to the}} 1961. For many years, the Waterloo College teams were called simply the Waterloo College teams, {{although}} <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> called the Purple and Gold and other times the Waterloons.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrangements}} for placing orphan children varied. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> pre-ordered by couples; {{at other times}} a local screening committee tried {{to make sure the}} children would be given to good parents; at other times the scene was more random.|$|R
