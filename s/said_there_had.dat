5|$|Interested {{parties on}} both sides filed amici. A group of {{conservative}} Republicans {{in both houses of}} Congress, including Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Henry Hyde and Rick Santorum, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the invaluable nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring reasonable suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible. Americans for Effective Law Enforcement <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been no entrapment and that reasonable suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. The American Civil Liberties Union, its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E

The RUC <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been 1,600 plastic bullets fired, 550 attacks on the {{security}} forces, and 41 people arrested. The fire service had received 500 calls and the ambulance service 150, while the damage to property was estimated at £20 million.|$|E
25|$|In later cases, {{brought in}} the 1950s {{involving}} other organized sports and similar activities, the Court had refused to exempt them and noted, as it did when asked to end baseball's exemption outright in Toolson, Congress's relative inactivity on the issue. Since then, Blackmun <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been some bills, but all intended to extend the exemption to other sports and none to repeal it entirely.|$|E
50|$|Houston Police Chief Charles McClelland <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> been an {{increase}} of people recording or taking pictures of police while making stops and is concerned that an intensifying anti-police sentiment in the community could increase negative interactions with residents.|$|R
50|$|According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been 27,199 homicides {{recorded}} in Mexico during 2011, {{making it the}} deadliest year since President Felipe Calderon was elected in 2006. During Calderon's presidency, Article 19 <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been 72 journalists murdered, 13 journalists reported missing, and 40 assaults on journalists.|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} food banks has {{increased}} rapidly even in Germany, {{a country that}} has weathered the crisis relatively well, and has not needed to implement severe austerity.

25|$|At the March 2013 hearing, Ellerbe {{also accused}} his department's {{mechanics}} and rank-and-file firefighters of purposefully sabotaging equipment. He cited the D.C. Inspector General's report of February 2013, which <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been allegations of sabotage (including driving vehicles in low gear to damage transmissions, slashing tires, and tampering with air conditioners). The following month, Ellerbe {{claimed he had}} complete confidence in the repair personnel at DCFEMS.|$|E
25|$|Some {{residents}} {{claimed they}} had not been properly consulted. Abrahams felt he should've been consulted because the design blocked his views. The Council disputed that there had been no consultation. The Strategic projects manager, Simon Guillemin, pointed out {{that there had been a}} number of public meetings and press releases. He also <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> also been consultation with the Birkenhead Town Centre Association and the Friends of the Library.|$|E
25|$|A state {{appropriation}} {{paid for}} the work. It was sculpted in clay by Jo Davidson. He had been {{a close friend of}} Rogers. Davidson had the work cast in bronze in Brussels, Belgium. Dedicated on June 6, 1939, before a crowd of more than 2,000people, the statue faces the floor entrance of the House of Representatives Chamber next to National Statuary Hall. The Architect of the Capitol, David Lynn, <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> never been such a large ceremony or crowd in the Capitol.|$|E

López-Sánchez's public defender <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been no discussions of a plea deal. However, the trial date set for December 2016 was postponed. López-Sánchez {{returned}} to court July 14, 2017 and a trial date is pending.|$|R
50|$|Lynn {{examined}} sibling {{studies and}} concluded that the tendency of children with a high number of siblings to be the least intelligent is evidence of dysgenic fertility. He <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> been a genuine increase in phenotypic intelligence, but that this is caused by environmental factors and is masking a decline in genotypic intelligence.|$|R
25|$|On 5 October 2016, Hong Kong pro-democratic activist Joshua Wong {{was barred}} from {{entering}} Thailand and deported. He {{had been invited}} by Thai student activist Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal to address students at Chulalongkorn University to mark the 40th anniversary of the Thammasat University massacre in 1976. Wong <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been no explanation for his detention. Thai officials admitted pressure from the Chinese government. Protest to the Royal Thai Consulate-General in Hong Kong was observed. 30 Hong Kong Legislative Councillors demanded explanation and apology from the Thai government.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, neighbors saw Frank Jr., age 6, lugging a {{pick and}} shovel out into South Troy Street and start digging. Upon inquiry, Frank <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> {{been a lot}} of {{construction}} on the street the day Elsie disappeared, and he had heard his parents discussing the possibility that she had fallen into a hole. As she struggled to climb out, she might have been buried under falling sand and gravel. Workers still fixing the street said that it was possible, but they would have noticed immediately. Meanwhile, people in the West End and a woman in Kings, Illinois reported sightings of light-skinned girls traveling with gypsies.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{a long-standing}} {{tradition}} of mead consumption, the beverage is a niche product in Poland. In 2013, about 600,000 litres of mead {{were sold in}} Poland, compared with 142.5 million litres of wine sold during the same period. Mead amounted to 0.5 percent of total alcohol consumption in Poland in 2013. Only nine percent of adult Poles polled that year declared that they had drunk mead {{at least once in}} the last three months; 27 percent said they had enjoyed mead in the last 12 months. Those who drank mead, did so mostly at family or social gatherings. A majority of those who did not, <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been no occasion for it.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{popularity}} in Hollywood movies and books like E. L. Doctorow's Billy Bathgate, whether such a cumbersome and time-consuming method of execution was practical remained in question. Cement takes hours to harden and, until 2016, {{there was never}} a documented case—although crime historian Thomas Reppetto <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> probably been real-life examples that have never been found.|$|R

25|$|Statements were {{collected}} from all the crew. These were all written out for presentation to the inquiry on standard forms in identical handwriting with similar phrasing. Quartermaster Johnston later described that pressure had been placed upon him to be loyal to the company, {{and that it had}} been suggested to him it would help the case if two torpedoes had struck the ship, rather than the one which he described. Giving evidence to the tribunal he was not asked about torpedoes. Other witnesses who claimed that only one torpedo had been involved were refused permission to testify. In contrast to his statement at the inquest, Captain Turner stated that two torpedoes had struck the ship, not one. In an interview in 1933, Turner reverted to his original statement that there had been only one torpedo. Most witnesses <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been two, but a couple said three, possibly involving a second submarine. Clem Edwards, representing the seamen's union, attempted to introduce evidence about which watertight compartments had been involved but was prevented from doing so by Lord Mersey.|$|E
25|$|Jay-Z {{serves as}} co-brand {{director}} for Budweiser Select and collaborates {{with the company}} on strategic marketing programs and creative ad development. He provides direction on brand programs and ads that appear on TV, radio, print, and high-profile events. He is also yet to expand his 40/40 Club sports bar {{in as many as}} 20 airports, as he makes deals with his business partners, Juan and Desiree Perez. He is a part-owner of the Brooklyn Nets NBA team, having paid a reported $4.5million for his share, which declined in value to $350,000 in April 2013. He encouraged the team's relocation to Brooklyn's Barclays Center (from New Jersey) in the 2012–2013 season, at which point the team took on the Brooklyn Nets moniker. In October 2005, he was reported in English media as considering buying a stake of Arsenal F.C., an English soccer team. He has also invested in a real estate development venture called J Hotels which recently acquired a $66million mid-block parcel in Chelsea, New York. Jay-Z and his partners are contemplating constructing a high-end hotel or an art gallery building on the newly acquired site which has the potential to go up about twelve stories. Through his conglomerate company Gain Global Investments Network LLC, he had an interest estimated between 2 and 7% in the Aqueduct Entertainment Group (AEG) consortium, which in January 2010 was awarded a contract to operate a 4,500 slot machine racino at the Aqueduct Race Track. Jay-Z became interested in the project after New York Governor David Paterson who awarded the contract <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> to be an affirmative action component to the ownership. Jay-Z initially approached by casino mogul Steve Wynn who was also bidding on the contract. On March 9, 2010, Jay-Z and Flake withdrew from the project and Paterson recused himself from further involvement.|$|E
500|$|Team manager Keith Johnson, {{the only}} {{administrator}} in the touring party, {{was flooded with}} phone calls and letters. Bradman later said he was worried that Johnson's tireless work would cause health problems and that [...] "it was the tribute to a bulldog determination to see the job through". Wisden said [...] "Indebtedness for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager, Mr Keith Johnson, hard-working and always genial... Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players, Mr Johnson <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> not been a discordant note in the party throughout the tour." [...] Bradman said that [...] "no side could have wished for a better manager".|$|E
2500|$|On 31 March, the Iranian {{consulate}} in Basra claimed that British troops were carrying out [...] "provocative acts", reiterating their earlier statement regarding a British {{attack on the}} consulate. The consulate <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> been intensive flying of fighter aircraft over the consulate building. Al-Hayat newspaper reported that the actions might be a scare tactic to pressure Iran into releasing the detainees.|$|R

500|$|Britain vigorously rallied other NATO {{countries}} {{to take a}} stand against Portugal over Reedman. France warned that NATO pressure was unlikely to yield results in his matter, but Belgium's NATO representative, André de Staercke, agreed to challenge Salazar on 11 September. At his meeting with de Staercke, Salazar denied that Portugal was giving Rhodesia its own diplomatic representation, and <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been some misunderstanding. Portugal would not obstruct Reedman's entry should he arrive, Salazar said, as he was travelling on a (Rhodesian-issued) British passport. On 14 September, Nogueira's ministry released a statement saying that if Britain challenged Portugal over Rhodesia at NATO, Lisbon would [...] "use the greatest firmness to repel any attempt to attribute particular responsibilities or to make criticism of Portugal's position".|$|E
500|$|Holtzman, who was {{trailing}} last in polls, borrowed over $400,000 from Fleet Bank to run {{a negative}} ad accusing Ferraro and Zaccaro of taking more than $300,000 in rent in the 1980s from a pornographer with ties to organized crime. [...] Ferraro <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been efforts to oust the man, Robert DiBernardo, after reports of the tenancy originated during her 1984 vice-presidential campaign, but he had remained in the building for three more years. [...] In addition, a report by an investigator for the New York State Organized Crime Task Force {{found its way to}} the media via a tip from a Holtzman aide; it said that Zaccaro had been seen meeting with the DiBernardo in 1985. [...] Ferraro said in response that those two had never met.|$|E
500|$|In {{a session}} of Prime Minister's Questions some weeks later, David Cameron {{challenged}} Brown to concede on record that [...] "no deals were done" [...] in ensuring {{the bill was}} passed. Brown stood before the House and said, [...] "yes". Cameron quoted from a letter written by Labour's Chief Whip Geoff Hoon to Keith Vazthe Chairman of the Home Affairs Committeein which Hoon expressed deep thanks for Vaz's support and closed the letter with the line, [...] "I trust {{that you will be}} appropriately rewarded". Hoon said that this was just a joke between friends but others, such as Conservative leader David Cameron and Shadow Home Secretary David Davis viewed this letter as proof that deals were indeed done behind the scenes and that Brown lied on the record when he <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been none. The House of Lords defeated the bill, which Lords said was [...] "fatally flawed, ill thought through and unnecessary", stating that [...] "it seeks to further erode...fundamental legal and civil rights".|$|E

5000|$|Brown pledged no new taxes, no {{increased}} taxes, {{and a look}} {{at state}} spending if elected. Hogan responded by citing Brown/O'Malley's same claim in the 2010 election and how that claim was followed by [...] "40 consecutive tax hikes." [...] Brown <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been times he's disagreed with O'Malley, like on mortgage reduction. [...] "Brown did not stay to take questions from reporters" [...] and both candidates accused the other of not telling the truth.|$|R
500|$|Johnson said {{he found}} SSH logs on the MacBook that showed an SFTP connection, from an IP address that {{resolved}} to Manning's aunt's home, to a Swedish IP address with links to WikiLeaks. Also found was a text file named [...] "Readme", attached to the logs and apparently written by Manning to Assange, which called the Iraq and Afghan War logs [...] "possibly {{one of the most}} significant documents of our time, removing the fog of war and revealing the true nature of 21st century asymmetric warfare". The investigators testified they had also recovered an exchange from May 2010 between Manning and Eric Schmiedl, a Boston mathematician, in which Manning said she was the source of the Baghdad helicopter attack ("Collateral Murder") video. Johnson <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been two attempts to delete material from the MacBook. The operating system had been re-installed in January 2010, and on or around January 31, 2010, an attempt had been made to erase the hard drive by doing a [...] "zero-fill", which involves overwriting material with zeroes. The material was recovered after the overwrite attempts from unallocated space.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{was again}} praised by Wisden {{in its report}} on the 1948 tour. [...] "Indebtedness for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager, Mr Keith Johnson, {{hard-working}} and always genial," [...] it said. [...] "Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players, Mr Johnson <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> not been a discordant note in the party throughout the tour." [...] Flanagan labelled Johnson as [...] "conscientious, reserved, dignified, extraordinarily industrious and scrupulously trustworthy". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "No organization, no body corporate, no individual could ever hope to have a more loyal, a more devoted, or a more conscientious officer...Although to the world in general all the praise and glory for the unequalled triumph the tour proved to be goes to Sir Donald Bradman, only those who travelled with the team will ever have a proper conception of the part played in that triumph by Keith Johnson." [...] Bradman said that Johnson [...] "created friends and goodwill everywhere both for himself and the team, and no side could have wished for a better Manager". On the journey back to Australia, the players presented Johnson with a silver Georgian salver, with their signatures engraved on the memento.|$|E
500|$|The World Bank loaned India {{funds for}} development, and Mayawati was to manage {{projects}} with this money in UP. The projects were preplanned and on schedule, but the Mayawati government made changes which put the projects behind schedule, including rapidly transferring high-caste managers {{in and out}} of rural posts. The World Bank sent a letter of complaint on 1 August 2002 to India's central government stating, [...] "We have now learnt that project managers have been replaced within three weeks of assuming office. The project coordinator of the Diversified Agriculture Support Project has been changed twice in quick succession and at the moment there is no project coordinator. In the forestry project, numerous changes have been made over the past six months ... Such developments do not augur well for these time-bound projects that require consistently good leadership." [...] Mayawati initially responded by saying the letter was a fake and later <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been a misunderstanding. She then decreased the number of transfers, stopped creating new posts, and temporarily reduced the level of government spending on furniture and vehicles in response to the allegations. The World Bank continued to criticise the level of corruption even after these measures had been implemented.|$|E
