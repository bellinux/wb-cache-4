25|$|Anesthesiology (also {{known as}} anaesthetics): {{concerned}} with the perioperative management of the <b>surgical</b> <b>patient.</b> The anesthesiologist's role during surgery is to prevent derangement in the vital organs' (i.e. brain, heart, kidneys) functions and postoperative pain. Outside of the operating room, the anesthesiology physician also serves the same function in the labor & delivery ward, and some are specialized in critical medicine.|$|E
25|$|The Consensus Panel also {{emphasized}} {{the necessity of}} multidisciplinary care of the bariatric <b>surgical</b> <b>patient</b> {{by a team of}} physicians and therapists to manage associated comorbidities and nutrition, physical activity, behavior, and psychological needs. The surgical procedure is best regarded as a tool which enables the patient to alter lifestyle and eating habits, and to achieve effective and permanent management of obesity and eating behavior.|$|E

After residency, many anesthesiologists complete an additional fellowship year of sub-specialty training {{in areas such as}} pain management, sleep medicine, cardiothoracic anesthesiology, pediatric anesthesiology, neuroanesthesiology, regional anesthesiology/ambulatory anesthesiology, obstetric anesthesiology, or critical care medicine.|$|E
40|$|Adverse drug events (ADEs) are a {{considerable}} cause of inhospital morbidity and mortality.

The objective {{of this study is}} to systematically review the occurrence and nature of ADEs in <b>surgical</b> <b>patients.</b> Also, a comparison with nonsurgical patients was made. A search was conducted in Embase and Medline identifying studies that reported observational data on the occurrence and nature of ADEs in <b>surgical</b> hospitalised adult <b>patients.</b> If sufficient data were available, the occurrence of (preventable) ADEs was compared between <b>surgical</b> and nonsurgical <b>patients.</b> Six studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The occurrence of ADEs in <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> ranged from 2. 0 to 27. 7 per 100 admissions, from 4. 7 to 8. 9 per 1, 000 patient days, or involved 8. 9 % of the patients. Proportions of preventable ADEs in <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> were 18 % and 54 %, described in two studies. A head-to-head comparison of <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> and nonsurgical patients was possible for five of six studies. The occurrence of ADEs in nonsurgical patients was significantly higher than in <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> in three studies. ADEs are a relevant problem in <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> and nonsurgical patients, with a high proportion of preventable ADEs. The occurrence of ADEs appears to be higher in nonsurgical <b>patients</b> than in <b>surgical</b> <b>patients.</b> However, studies lack details on the differences in nature of ADEs between hospital populations.

40|$|Suboptimal {{levels of}} feeding in {{critically}} ill patients {{are associated with}} poor clinical outcomes. The Enhanced Protein-Energy Provision via the Enteral Route Feeding (PEPuP) protocol was developed to improve nutritional delivery in the critically ill and has been studied in several hospitals. However, the experience with this protocol in <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> is limited to date. The objective of this analysis was to describe the experience with this protocol in <b>surgical</b> <b>patients.</b> We analysed observational patient data obtained from the 2013 International Nutrition Survey. We compared nutritional practices and outcomes of <b>patients</b> admitted for <b>surgical</b> and medical reasons to ICUs in sites that implemented the PEPuP protocol. We used <b>surgical</b> ICU <b>patients</b> in non-PEPuP sites as a concurrent control group. In sites that implemented the PEPuP protocol, <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> received a smaller proportion of prescribed calories (43 % versus 61 %, P= 0. 004) and protein (38 % versus 57 %, P= 0. 002) compared to medical patients. When compared to the cohort of <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> from control sites, the <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> from PEPuP sites received similar amounts of calories and protein. Although <b>surgical</b> PEPuP <b>patients</b> {{were more likely to}} receive trophic and volume-based feeds compared to <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> in control sites, other aspects of the PEPuP protocol were not adequately implemented. We conclude that nutritional delivery to <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> remains inadequate and the PEPuP protocol seems ineffective in improving nutritional intake in this population. Further research to determine methods of optimising PEPuP protocol implementation and adherence in surgery patients is needed. B Declercq, AM Deane, M Wang, MJ Chapman, DK Heylan...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{well known}} that a {{significant}} proportion of hospitalized medical and <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> with risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are not receiving thromboprophylaxis. We designed this study to evaluate the proportion of at-risk patients and the proportion of those receiving recommended prophylaxis. METHODS: We conducted a multicentric cross-sectional survey that included medical and <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> from 43 hospitals throughout Mexico. Patients who were at risk for DVT according to the ACCP 2004 guidelines were included and evaluated for thromboprophylaxis. RESULTS: Overall, 625 patients were at risk: 308 (49 %) <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> and 317 (51 %) medical patients. There were 179 (58 %) <b>surgical</b> <b>patients</b> receiving recommended prophylaxis, whereas medical patients represented 117 (37 %) patients.
