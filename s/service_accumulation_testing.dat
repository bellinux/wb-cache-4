40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{dissolved}} organic carbon (DOC) derived from macroalga (Sargassum) on the acute toxicity of copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) to a freshwater cladoceran (Daphnia magna) was investigated. Potassium-loaded macroalga was incubated with ultra-pure water to extract macroalgal DOC, which was then spiked with the constituents of the Elendt M 7 hard water media. The 48 h median lethal concentration Of Cu increased linearly with DOC levels but that of Cd was relatively independent of DOC levels (0 - 44 mg l(- 1)). The independence of Cd toxicity on DOC leviel {{might be due to}} the competitive effect of high calcium concentrations in the media with Cd for the binding sites of DOC.

The flawed system {{can also be used to}} validate that the diagnostic measurements are sensitive enough to distinguish between features identified from the undamaged and damaged system.

Damage <b>accumulation</b> <b>testing,</b> during which significant structural components of the system under study are degraded by subjecting them to realistic loading conditions, can also be used to identify appropriate features.

Experiments were performed on adult worms from 6 species. Freely floating coelomocytes (consisting of amoebocytes plus species-specific numbers of eleocytes) were extruded by mild electric shock and then chloragocytes from the same anaesthetized worm were mechanically detached into buffer. Both cell suspensions were analyzed by spectrofluorometry for riboflavin content. It turned out that riboflavin is stored in species-specific quantities in all investigated species. Riboflavin storage predominates in free coelomocytes of eleocyte-rich species (Eisenia andrei, Dendrobaena veneta, Allolobophora chlorotica) while in chloragocytes of species with few eleocytes (Lumbricus terrestris, L. rubellus, and Aporrectodea caliginosa).

30|$|In this study, the duration-of-load {{effect on}} the rolling shear {{strength}} of cross laminated timber (CLT), with different cross-sectional layups (five-layer and three-layer), was evaluated. A stress-based damage accumulation model is chosen to evaluate the duration-of-load strength adjustment factor of the rolling shear strength of CLT. This model incorporates the established short-term rolling shear strength of material and predicts the time to failure under arbitrary loading history. The model has been calibrated and verified based on the test data from low cycle trapezoidal fatigue <b>tests</b> (damage <b>accumulation</b> <b>tests)</b> in the previous study. The long-term rolling shear behaviour of CLT can then be evaluated from this verified model. As the developed damage accumulation model is a probabilistic model, it {{can be incorporated into}} a time based reliability assessment of the CLT products, considering short-term, snow, and dead load only loading cases. The reliability analysis results and factors reflecting the duration-of-load {{effect on the}} rolling shear strength of CLT are compared and discussed. The characteristic of this modeling theory lies in that the verified model is also able to predict the duration-of-load behaviour of CLT products under arbitrary loading history, such as long-term dead load case; then, these predictions of time to failure from the damage accumulation model can elucidate duration of load by the stress ratio evaluation approach. The results suggest that the duration-of-load rolling shear strength adjustment factor for CLT is more severe than the general duration-of-load adjustment factor for lumber; this difference should be considered in the introduction of CLT into the building codes for engineered wood design.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{framework}} based on selectively traversed accumulation rules (STAR) for interactive "human-in-the-loop" multiple testing with generic structural {{constraints on the}} rejection set. STAR combines <b>accumulation</b> <b>tests</b> from ordered multiple testing with data-carving ideas from post-selection inference, allowing for highly flexible adaptation to generic structural information. Given independent p-values for each of n null hypotheses, STAR defines an iterative protocol for gradually pruning a candidate rejection set, beginning with R_ 0 = [n] and shrinking with each step. At step t, the analyst estimates the false discovery proportion (FDP) of the current rejection set R_t, and halts and rejects every H_i with i ∈R_t if FDP_t ≤α. Otherwise, the analyst may shrink the rejection set to R_t+ 1 ⊆R_t however she wants, provided the choice depends only on partially masked p-values g(p_i) for i∈R_t, as well as unmasked p-values p_i for i∉R_t. Typically, the choice {{will be based on}} eliminating the "least promising" hypothesis from R_t, after estimating a model from the observable data. By restricting the information available to the analyst, our iterative protocol guarantees exact false discovery rate (FDR) control at level α in finite samples, for any data-adaptive update rule the analyst may choose. We suggest heuristic update rules for a variety of applications with complex structural constraints, show that STAR performs well for problems ranging from convex region detection and bump-hunting to FDR control on trees and DAGs, and show how to extend STAR to regression problems where knockoff statistics are available in lieu of p-values.
