5|$|Although the Australian/New Zealand <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the F94L {{mutation}} {{was partially}} to significantly recessive in most traits, meaning cattle heterozygous for the mutation express less to {{significantly less than}} half of the effects noted for homozygous cattle, the Japanese <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the meat and fat quantities in cattle heterozygous for the mutation were about midway between the two extremes.|$|E
5|$|In many {{temperate}} regions, beavers play {{an essential}} hydrological role. When building their dams and lodges, beavers alter {{the paths of}} streams and rivers and allow {{for the creation of}} extensive wetland habitats. One <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> engineering by beavers leads to a 33 percent {{increase in the number of}} herbaceous plant species in riparian areas. Another <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> beavers increase wild salmon populations.|$|E

25|$|A {{review of}} {{longitudinal}} <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> measures of baseline subjective well-being constructs such as optimism and positive affect predicted longer-term health status and mortality.

Baseline health may well have a causal influence on subjective well-being so causality is difficult to establish.|$|R
5|$|A 2008 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{sperm whales}} sleep in {{vertical}} postures {{just under the}} surface in passive shallow 'drift-dives', generally during the day, during which whales {{do not respond to}} passing vessels unless they are in contact, leading to the suggestion that whales possibly sleep during such dives.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{individuals}} {{with a history of}} concussions might demonstrate a decline in both physical and mental performance for longer than 30 years.

5|$|A 2016 DHHS <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{states that}} {{expanded}} Medicaid had lower premiums on exchange policies, {{because they had}} fewer low-income enrollees, whose health on average is worse than that of those with higher income.|$|E

5|$|A June 2013, <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the MLR {{provision}} {{had saved}} individual insurance consumers $1.2 billion in 2011 and $2.1 billion in 2012, reducing their 2012 costs by 7.5%. The {{bulk of the}} savings were in reduced premiums, but some came from MLR rebates.|$|E

5|$|A {{follow-up}} <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{the optimum}} duration for the deep safety stop under the experimental conditions was 2.5 minutes, with a shallow safety stop of 3 to 5 minutes. Longer safety stops at either depth did not further reduce PDDB.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} {{evidence}} in 2005 suggested that PrP may have a normal function in maintenance of long-term memory. As well, a 2004 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> mice lacking genes for normal cellular PrP protein show altered hippocampal long-term potentiation.|$|E
5|$|A <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 44 {{percent of}} the world's {{international}} airports are named by toponyms: named for politicians (thirty percent), aviators (seven percent), mythology and religion (three percent), public figures (two percent), people of science (two percent) and other (one percent).|$|E

5|$|During oral {{argument}} before the Court, Scalia asked more questions and made more comments {{than any other}} justice—and a 2005 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> he provoked laughter more often {{than any of his}} colleagues did.

5|$|Physical {{investment}} {{seems to}} have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction. Regarding foreign direct investment, a <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during {{the first four years}} of the EMU. Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.|$|E
