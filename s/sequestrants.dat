5|$|Heterozygous FH is {{normally}} treated with statins, bile acid <b>sequestrants,</b> or other lipid lowering agents that lower cholesterol levels. New cases are generally offered genetic counseling. Homozygous FH often {{does not respond}} to medical therapy and may require other treatments, including LDL apheresis (removal of LDL in a method similar to dialysis) and occasionally liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Given that FH {{is present}} from birth and {{atherosclerotic}} changes may begin early in life, {{it is sometimes}} necessary to treat adolescents or even teenagers with agents that were originally developed for adults. Due to safety concerns, many physicians prefer to use bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> and fenofibrate as these are licensed in children. Nevertheless, statins seem safe and effective, and in older children {{may be used as}} in adults.|$|E
5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend {{that the decision to}} treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E

40|$|Many {{combination}} drug therapies {{are effective}} in treating dyslipidemia. Compared with statin monotherapy, combinations that include ezetimibe (Zetia), a bile acid <b>sequestrant,</b> or niacin further lower low- density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (strength of recommendation [SOR]: A), and {{increase the likelihood of}} attaining National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) LDL cholesterol goals (SOR: B). Adding ezetimibe to a bile acid <b>sequestrant</b> reduces LDL cholesterol (SOR: B). Fibrate or niacin added to statin monotherapy provide mixed lipid-modifying effects for combined dyslipidemia (SOR: A) ...|$|R
25|$|Bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> such as {{cholestyramine}} can {{be effective}} in chronic diarrhea due to bile acid malabsorption. Therapeutic trials of these drugs are indicated in chronic diarrhea if bile acid malabsorption cannot be diagnosed with a specific test, such as SeHCAT retention.|$|E
25|$|Atorvastatin {{may be used}} in {{combination}} with bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> and ezetimibe to increase the reduction in cholesterol levels. However, It is not recommended to combine statin drug treatment with certain other cholesterol-lowering drugs, particularly fibrates, because this may increase the risk of myopathy-related adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|Elevated {{cholesterol}} levels {{are treated with}} a strict diet consisting of low saturated fat, trans fat-free, low cholesterol foods, often followed by one of various hypolipidemic agents, such as statins, fibrates, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, nicotinic acid derivatives or bile acid <b>sequestrants.</b> Extreme cases have previously been treated with partial ileal bypass surgery, which has now been superseded by medication. Apheresis-based treatments are still used for very severe hyperlipidemias that are either unresponsive to treatment or require rapid lowering of blood lipids. There are several international guidelines on the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia.|$|E

50|$|Chronic {{diarrhea}} in postcholecystectomy {{syndrome is}} a type of bile acid diarrhea (type 3). This can be treated with a bile acid <b>sequestrant</b> like cholestyramine, colestipol or colesevelam, which may be better tolerated.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to bile acids, bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> may also bind {{drugs in the}} GI tract, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream. For this reason, it is generally advised that bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> be spaced several hours apart from other drugs.|$|E
50|$|Bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> {{are large}} {{polymeric}} structures, {{and they are}} not significantly absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream. Thus, bile acid <b>sequestrants,</b> along with any bile acids bound to the drug, are excreted via the feces after passage through the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sequestrants</b> and {{chelating}} agents {{are used to}} [...] "disarm" [...] metal ions present in the solution, which could otherwise reduce the efficiency of other components, and assist with cleaning stains, which often contain metal compounds.

50|$|Because {{bile acid}} <b>sequestrants</b> are not well-absorbed from the gut, they are {{generally}} regarded as safe in pregnant women. However, by interfering with vitamin absorption, they could cause vitamin deficiencies that may affect the fetus. Hence, vitamin supplementation may be considered, with appropriate intervals between dosing of the vitamins and bile acid <b>sequestrants.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> (resins, e.g. cholestyramine) are {{particularly}} effective for lowering LDL-C by sequestering the cholesterol-containing bile acids {{released into the}} intestine and preventing their reabsorption from the intestine. It decreases LDL by 15-30% and raises HDL by 3-5%, with little effect on triglycerides but can cause a slight increase. Bile acid <b>sequestrants</b> may cause gastrointestinal problems and may also reduce the absorption of other drugs and vitamins from the gut.|$|E
50|$|Colesevelam {{is one of}} the bile-acid <b>sequestrants,</b> which {{along with}} niacin and the statins, are the three main types of {{cholesterol-lowering}} agents. The statins are considered the first-line agents. This is because of the larger body of evidence supporting statins' ability to prevent cardiovascular disease, as well as the prominent side effects from the other two types, including bloating and constipation (bile-acid <b>sequestrants)</b> and skin flushing (niacin). These side effects often lead to low patient compliance.|$|E
50|$|Colestilan (INN, {{trade name}} BindRen) is a {{medication}} {{that acts as}} a phosphate binder and bile acid <b>sequestrant.</b> It is an ion-exchange resin, is an orally administered bile acid <b>sequestrant</b> that is being developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and hyperphosphataemia. It has been launched in Japan for hypercholesterolaemia. For the treatment of hyperphosphataemia, it is launched in Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Portugal and the United Kingdom, is registered in the EU. Phase III development in paediatric patients with hyperphosphataemia associated with chronic kidney disease was underway in the UK and Germany. However, the company discontinued the development. In addition, the phase II development in type-2 diabetes mellitus and phase I development in hyperphosphataemia, in Japan, was also discontinued by the company.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} at least 18 studies of the use of SeHCAT testing in diarrhea-predominant {{irritable}} bowel syndrome patients. When these data were combined, 32% of 1223 patients had a SeHCAT 7-day retention of less than 10%, and 80% of these reported a response to cholestyramine, a bile acid <b>sequestrant.</b>|$|R
5000|$|To relieve itching {{caused by}} bile acids in circulation, which are {{normally}} removed by the liver, cholestyramine (a bile acid <b>sequestrant)</b> may be prescribed to absorb bile acids {{in the gut}} and be eliminated, rather than re-enter the blood stream.
