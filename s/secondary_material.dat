25|$|The Mahābhārata itself (1.1.61) distinguishes a core {{portion of}} 24,000 verses: the Bhārata proper, {{as opposed to}} {{additional}} <b>secondary</b> <b>material,</b> while the Aśvalāyana Gṛhyasūtra (3.4.4) makes a similar distinction. At least three redactions of the text are commonly recognized: Jaya (Victory) with 8,800 verses attributed to Vyāsa, Bhārata with 24,000 verses as recited by Vaiśampāyana, and finally the Mahābhārata as recited by Ugraśrava Sauti with over 100,000 verses. However, some scholars, such as John Brockington, argue that Jaya and Bharata refer to the same text, and ascribe the theory of Jaya with 8,800 verses to a misreading of a verse in Ādiparvan (1.1.81).|$|E

40|$|Since the UK government's Waste Strategy was {{introduced}} in 2000 there has been sustained emphasis on the diversion of waste material from landfill {{and it has been}} acknowledged that stable markets for <b>secondary</b> <b>materials</b> must be developed to ensure that the resources used to recover them are not expended needlessly. This thesis looks at the issues surrounding a designer's ability to select <b>secondary</b> <b>materials</b> for the production of new artefacts and proposes a new framework for supporting that activity. While in the past recycled materials have mainly been used either for highly visible 'one-offs' or hidden components the stance taken here is that both creative design and volume production are essential for stable markets in the short term and effective materials cycles in the future. Therefore product and industrial design was the initial focus of this research. The investigation involved three empirical enquiries: Enquiry 1 employed a survey method to explore the design scenario of product and industrial designers and its influence on their ability to select <b>secondary</b> <b>materials.</b> Enquiries 2 & 3 looked at the issues involved in recovering and using <b>secondary</b> <b>materials</b> (focusing on plastic in London), and the tools currently available to support designers. The primary research suggests that the scenario of product and industrial design consultants is not generally conducive to the consideration and use of <b>secondary</b> <b>materials.</b> Specifications for two tools that could improve the situation are proposed: 1) to build knowledge and awareness of <b>secondary</b> <b>materials,</b> and; 2) to improve materials information for design. However the issues with using <b>secondary</b> <b>materials</b> in design practice are manifold and so the research concludes with a framework identifying five central considerations for supporting the use of <b>secondary</b> <b>materials</b> in design practice. This thesis contributes original knowledge in the field of design research by: • proposing specifications for new tools to support the use of <b>secondary</b> <b>materials</b> in design practice; • presenting a range of approaches to sourcing and using <b>secondary</b> <b>materials</b> in design practice; • furthering understanding of the design scenario and how it may inhibit or enable designers to act in specific ways; • challenging existing approaches to material information provision for designers with a new emphasis on dialogue with specialists and the important role of materials librarians.

2500|$|The {{views on}} Great Moravian sacral {{architecture}} changed dramatically {{during the second}} half of the 20th century. First researchers assumed only an existence of simple wooden churches like those which are known from the German environment in the 7th-8th century. The wooden churches were suitable for initial missionary activities because of easy availability of materials, quick construction and no need for consecration. [...] This opinion was refined in 1949 after excavations in Staré Město. From 1960s, stone churches are known also from Slovakia. Until 2014, more than 25 sacral buildings have been safely identified in the core territory of Great Moravia (Moravia and Western Slovakia). The remains of the first uncovered churches were only [...] "negatives" [...] (ditches filled with <b>secondary</b> <b>material</b> after removal of original foundations), but later research also uncovered remains of buildings with original foundations. Especially after the discovery of Great Moravian graves near the church in Kopčany, the potential Great Moravian origin of several still standing churches in Slovakia became again an actual question (Kopčany, Nitrianska Blatnica, Kostoľany pod Tribečom). The exact dating is a goal of ongoing research based on radiocarbon analysis and dendrochronology.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Secondary</b> <b>materials</b> {{can be used}} as {{construction}} materials in case their properties satisfy the requirements. The authors investigated steel slags (EAF 1 and ladle slag) as <b>secondary</b> <b>materials</b> to be used in a landfill cover construction. In the near future many landfills in Sweden have to be closed and covered (EU, 1999). Using <b>secondary</b> <b>materials</b> that fulfil the requirements can save natural resources and, on the other hand, avoids the detriment of the landscape through excavation of raw materials as clays and helps to minimize costintensive landfilling of <b>secondary</b> <b>materials.</b> The presented paper deals with alterations of the mineralogical composition of steel slags due to ageing processes as a base for estimations of the long-term stability. Since the project started only recently, this paper gives primarily the research questions, the experimental set up and the methodology used. Some of the expected results are discussed. 1...|$|R
