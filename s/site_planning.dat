5|$|The Murrah Federal Building {{had been}} {{considered}} so safe that it only employed one security guard. In June 1995, the DOJ issued Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities, also known as The Marshals Report, the findings of {{which resulted in a}} thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1,300federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government. Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, <b>site</b> <b>planning</b> and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} {{interference}} {{is a function}} of the signal processors used within the radar, the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbines/aircraft with respect to the radar. An aircraft flying above the wind farm's turning blades could become impossible to detect because the blade tips can be moving at nearly aircraft velocity. Studies are currently being performed to determine the level of this interference and will be used in future <b>site</b> <b>planning.</b> Issues include masking (shadowing), clutter (noise), and signal alteration. Radar issues have stalled as much as 10,000 MW of projects in USA.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{bird species}} are {{seasonal}} {{visitors to the}} offshore cays and are only in evidence at Hans Lollik during the summer breeding season. [...] The most conspicuous birds at the study sites are the resident seabird species, including the brown booby (Sula melanogaster) and the brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis). [...] Both species utilize the bait-rich waters of Hans Lollik for feeding; both species target white fry, blue fry, or false pilchard as preferred prey. [...] The prime roosting spots for these species have been located and mapped by JDA to enable the <b>site</b> <b>planning</b> process to avoid these areas.

2500|$|In December 1883, bandits {{committed}} the Bisbee Massacre in Tombstone, killing four innocent bystanders and wounding two {{others in the}} course of a robbery. The five men were convicted and sentenced to die by hanging on 28 March 1884. Many people were eager to make a spectacle of the execution. A local carpenter built a grandstand next to the hanging <b>site,</b> <b>planning</b> to charge for tickets. Cashman was outraged, feeling that no execution should be celebrated. She befriended the five convicts, visiting them to provide spiritual guidance. Cashman convinced the sheriff to set a curfew on the day of the hangings to prevent a crowd from forming. The night before the execution, Cashman and a crew of volunteers tore down the grandstand. The hangings proceeded as scheduled, but out of public view. When Cashman learned that a medical school planned to exhume the bodies of the convicts for study, she enlisted two prospectors to stand watch over the Boot Hill Cemetery for 10 days.|$|E
2500|$|Havemeyer Building [...] This {{building}} {{located at}} 290 Greenwich Avenue {{was the first}} to be built {{in the area of the}} Greenwich Municipal Center Historic District. It was designed by Loring and Phipps and has a Richardsonian Romanesque design with a pronounced horizontality, and further accented by several architectural elements. These include the Syrian arch surrounding the recessed entrance and the elliptical-arched loggia in front of the auditorium wing. The building was originally built for use as a public school, the Havemeyer School, in 1892 by New York philanthropist Henry O. Havemeyer. This building set the standard for architectural design and <b>site</b> <b>planning</b> that would be adhered to by the newer buildings in the Municipal Center district. In front of the building are two war memorials: one for World War II and the Korean War (built 1956), and another to the memory of Col. Raynal Bolling (built 1921). It is currently used by the Greenwich Board of Education.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his eight}} years as mayor, Giuliani was a {{constant}} advocate of publicly funded stadiums. Giuliani had already been instrumental {{in the construction of}} taxpayer-funded minor league baseball facilities KeySpan Park for the Mets' minor league Brooklyn Cyclones and Richmond County Bank Ballpark for the Staten Island Yankees. [...] The dual $1 billion plans had also been put forth unsuccessfully by Giuliani in 1996. [...] Giuliani faced questions about how to finance these stadiums, while the city struggled to balance the budget. Recently built stadiums in Baltimore and Cleveland had cost one-third to one-fourth the $1 billion set aside for the proposed New York stadiums; the $1 billion stadiums were to be the most expensive in American history. His 1998 plan to relocate the Yankees to the west side of Manhattan had been met with strong opposition; at that time, $3 million in city money was given to the Yankees for <b>site</b> <b>planning.</b> [...] Six city officials were sent on a city trip to explore stadiums in Baltimore, Denver and other cities.|$|E

2500|$|On 9 March 2011, the Vietnam {{government}} formally {{established the}} wall as a National Heritage <b>site,</b> <b>planning</b> to request the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage designation {{and to make the}} wall a global tourist site. In view of Quảng Ngãi's history, developing the wall for tourism would be difficult, CNN's Adam Bray noted. Tourism in Quảng Ngãi has been considerably limited by the government. Establishing {{the wall as}} a tourist destination would call for government encouragement of [...] "adventure trekking and cycling through previously isolated highland communities on an unprecedented scale", introducing historical ecotourism. The government plans to build a [...] "protected corridor stretching 500m {{on either side of the}} wall", and the People's Committee of Quảng Ngãi has devoted VND15 billion to rejuvenating and maintaining the wall. Nguyen Giang Hai of the Vietnam Institute of Archaeology asserted that since the preservation of the relic is contingent on indigenous sentiment, [...] "there is a need to sow the seed of consciousness for protecting the relic in the community living alongside the structure." [...] Young articulated that in the case of tourism, [...] "income-generation opportunities" [...] should be available for locals, since [...] "a world heritage is not something to admire but [...] for the benefit of the people".|$|E
2500|$|Onshore wind {{investors will}} also have to get prior {{approval}} for their projects under the Federal Immission Control Act (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetzes or BlmSchG), the federal law regulating the harmful effects of air pollution, noise, vibration and similar phenomena. [...] Citizens cooperatives (Genossenschaft) participating in wind energy tenders have special dispensations. [...] Wind energy auctions will be held more often in the beginning, with three in 2017 and four in 2018, in order to quickly establish a price level. [...] The annual capacity for onshore wind farms will be set at 2.8GW per year for 2017 to 2019 and at 2.9GW thereafter. [...] In order to better synchronise the development of the grid with renewables growth, the addition of onshore wind will be restricted to specified 'grid congestion zones' where high inputs of renewable electricity cannot be accepted because of network congestion. [...] These areas are to be identified by the Federal Network Agency. [...] The new rules on funding offshore wind farms will apply to those projects that commence operation in 2021 or later. [...] From 2025, the government will specify the sites for future wind farms and investors will then compete for the right to build at those locations. [...] This centralised (Danish) model is designed to ensure competition and to make project approvals, <b>site</b> <b>planning,</b> and network connections more cost effective and better integrated. [...] Between 2021 and 2024 a transitional auction model will be used and wind farms that have been planned and approved but not built will compete in two rounds of tenders for a restricted amount of capacity. [...] Offshore wind will remain capped at 15GW by 2030 and the capacity auctioned each year will be consistent with this target. [...] In 2021, only wind farms in the Baltic Sea will be considered, due to a shortage of network connections at the North Sea. [...] Biomass projects will also participate in the new auction system. [...] Biomass capacity is to be expanded by 150MW annually in the next three years and by 200MW annually for the following three years. [...] Installations with a capacity greater than 150kW will also be able to tender. [...] Biomass facilities will only receive remuneration for half their runtime in order to incentivize their use during times of high electricity prices. [...] Hydroelectricity, geothermal, and mine, landfill, and sewage gas are excluded from the auction system because of the prospect of insufficient competition.|$|E
