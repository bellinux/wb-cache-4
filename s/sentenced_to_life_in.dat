5|$|Garza, {{troubled by}} what he had done, confessed to the police that he acted as a {{middleman}} in Fischer's murder. He cooperated with the police to incriminate Martínez, who then aided in Cisneros' arrest. Cisneros and Garza were eventually <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison by a state court in 1994, but Cisneros' sentence was overturned due to a legal technicality. She was convicted again in 1998 by a federal court and <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison. Martínez was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty and testifying against the two in court. Though U.S. officials tried to have the two assassins extradited, the hitmen never faced trial in Texas. They were prosecuted in Mexico and given a 15-year sentence.|$|E

5|$|Habré {{consolidated}} his dictatorship {{through a}} power system that relied on corruption and violence {{with thousands of}} people estimated to have been killed under his rule. The president favoured his own Toubou ethnic group and discriminated against his former allies, the Zaghawa. His general, Idriss Déby, overthrew him in 1990. Attempts to prosecute Habré led to his placement under house arrest in Senegal in 2005; in 2013, Habré was formally charged with war crimes committed during his rule. In May 2016, he {{was found guilty of}} human-rights abuses, including rape, sexual slavery, and ordering the killing of 40,000 people, and <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison.|$|E

Conversely, the Jamaican LGBT community held a secret memorial for him, while protests against the killing were held by LGBT rights groups in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Cisneros {{was jailed}} in the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee, Florida. Years after her imprisonment, she {{maintained}} {{that she did}} not order Fischer's murder.

Garza, who was <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison, turned to religion and became a devout Catholic. In a letter written to the press in 2013, he thanked God for saving his life after two ruptured stomach ulcers, and a heart attack that nearly killed him in 2012. He was imprisoned at the age of 42 and will not be eligible for parole until June 2028 (when he is 78 years old). He has spent time in several Texas prisons, including the Louis C.

5|$|In late 2013, Zhou Yongkang, {{a former}} member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) and head of China's {{security}} agencies, was placed under investigation by the CCDI for abuse of power and corruption, a decision state media announced in July 2014. Zhou was the first PSC member – and the most senior-ranked official – since the founding of the People's Republic of China to be tried and convicted of corruption-related charges. Following his investigation, Zhou was expelled from the CPC. On 11 June 2015, Zhou was convicted of bribery, abuse of power and the intentional disclosure of state secrets by the Intermediate Court in Tianjin.

5|$|It was {{probably}} Stangl's brother-in law who informed Wiesenthal of Stangl's whereabouts in 1964. Concerned that Stangl would be warned and escape, Wiesenthal quietly prepared a dossier {{with the assistance}} of Austrian Minister of Justice Hans Klecatsky. Stangl was arrested outside his home in São Paulo on 28 February 1967 and was extradited to Germany on 22 June. A month later Wiesenthal's book The Murderers Among Us was released. Wiesenthal's publishers advertised that he had been responsible for locating over 800 Nazis, a claim that had no basis in fact but was nonetheless repeated by reputable newspapers such as the New York Times. Stangl was <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison and died of heart failure in June 1971, having confessed his guilt to biographer Gitta Sereny the previous day.|$|E

[...] His wife and his influential family attempted <b>to</b> commute the <b>sentence</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> a convent, rather than the dungeons of the inquisition.

5|$|On October 6, 1993, Jordan {{announced}} his retirement, citing {{a loss of}} desire to play the game. Jordan later stated that {{the death of his}} father three months earlier also shaped his decision. Jordan's father was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked the luxury vehicle. The assailants were traced from calls that they made on James Jordan's cell phone. The two criminals were caught, convicted at trial, and <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison. Jordan was close to his father; as a child he had imitated his father's proclivity to stick out his tongue while absorbed in work. He later adopted it as his own signature, displaying it each time he drove to the basket. In 1996, he founded a Chicago area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.|$|E
5|$|The trial, {{which was}} held from 22 July to 4 October 1948, was marked by {{numerous}} irregularities. The principal {{witness for the prosecution}} was shot dead three days before the trial, and much of the evidence against the defendants was obtained through torture. All three were found guilty of conspiracy against the state and endangering national security. Although these points were raised at the trial, Ravoahangy was sentenced to death, along with Raseta and four other nationalists, while Rabemananjara was <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison. In July 1949, the convicts' death sentences were commuted to life in prison, and the trio remained imprisoned until they were granted amnesty in 1958. Few individuals, with the notable exception of Monja Jaona, the founder of Jiny in the south, have claimed responsibility for a leadership role in the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson {{man who was}} {{fixated on}} Giffords, was arrested at the scene. Federal {{prosecutors}} filed five charges against him, including the attempted assassination {{of a member of}} Congress and the assassination of a federal judge. Loughner previously had been arrested (but not convicted) once on a minor drug charge and had been suspended by his college for disruptive behavior. Court filings include notes handwritten by Loughner indicating he planned to assassinate Giffords. Loughner did not cooperate with authorities, invoking his right to remain silent. He was held without bail and indicted on 49 counts. In January 2012, Loughner was found by a federal judge to be incompetent to stand trial based on two medical evaluations, which diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. Judged still incompetent to stand trial on May 25, finally on August 7, Loughner had a hearing at which he was judged competent. He pleaded guilty to 19 counts, and in November 2012 was <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison.|$|E
