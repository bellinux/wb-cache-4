500|$|Bile duct obstruction, {{which is}} usually present in acute cholangitis, is {{generally}} due to gallstones. 10–30% of cases, however, are due to other causes such as benign <b>stricturing</b> (narrowing of the bile duct without an underlying tumor), postoperative damage or an altered structure of the bile ducts such as narrowing {{at the site of}} an anastomosis (surgical connection), various tumors (cancer of the bile duct, gallbladder cancer, cancer of the ampulla of Vater, pancreatic cancer, cancer of the duodenum), anaerobic organisms such as Clostridium and Bacteroides (especially in the elderly and those who have undergone previous surgery of the biliary system). Parasites which may infect the liver and bile ducts may cause cholangitis; these include [...] the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides and the liver flukes Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini and Opisthorchis felineus. In people with AIDS, a large number of opportunistic organisms has been known to cause AIDS cholangiopathy, but the risk has rapidly diminished since the introduction of effective AIDS treatment. Cholangitis may also complicate medical procedures involving the bile duct, especially ERCP. To prevent this, it is recommended that those undergoing ERCP for any indication receive prophylactic (preventative) antibiotics.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Urethral <b>strictures</b> {{are common}} in urologic {{practice}} of Sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria. We determine the rate of <b>stricture</b> recurrence following urethroplasty for anterior urethral <b>strictures</b> and evaluate preoperative variables that predict of <b>stricture</b> recurrence in our practice. Subjects and Methods: Thirty-six men who had urethroplasty for proven anterior urethral <b>stricture</b> disease between February 2012 and January 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative factors including age, socioeconomic factors, comorbidities, etiology of <b>strictures,</b> <b>stricture</b> location, <b>stricture</b> length, periurethral spongiofibrosis, and prior <b>stricture</b> treatments were assessed for independent predictors of <b>stricture</b> recurrence. Results: The median age was 49. 5 years (range 21 - 90), median <b>stricture</b> length was 4 cm (range 1 - 18 cm) and the overall recurrence rate was 27. 8 %. Postinfectious <b>strictures,</b> pan urethral <b>strictures</b> or multiple <b>strictures</b> involving the penile and bulbar urethra were more common. Most patients had penile circular fasciocutaneous flap urethroplasty. Following univariate analysis of potential preoperative predictors of <b>stricture</b> recurrence, <b>stricture</b> length, and prior treatments with dilations or urethrotomies {{were found to be}} significantly associated with <b>stricture</b> recurrence. On multivariate analysis, they both remained statistically significant. Patients who had prior treatments had greater odds of having a recurrent <b>stricture</b> (odds ratio 18, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 4 - 224. 3). <b>Stricture</b> length was dichotomized based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and <b>strictures</b> of length ≥ 5 cm had significantly greater recurrence (area under ROC curve of 0. 825, 95 % CI 0. 690 - 0. 960, P = 0. 032).

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} independent {{risk factors}} for development of benign cervical anastomotic <b>strictures</b> in general and specifically for refractory <b>strictures</b> after esophagectomy in a large series of patients. Summary Background Data: Benign <b>strictures</b> develop frequently when a cervical anastomosis is performed after esophagectomy, causing burdensome symptoms and poor quality of life. Methods: From 1996 to 2006, all patients in the Academic Medical Center prospective database undergoing esophagectomy with a cervical anastomosis were included. <b>Stricture</b> was defined as dysphagia requiring endoscopic dilation of the anastomosis. Prediction of <b>stricture</b> was assessed using uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Evaluation of risk factors was also performed for refractory <b>strictures</b> (> 2 times the median number of dilations in all patients with <b>stricture)</b> in a similar fashion. Results: A total of 607 patients underwent potentially curative esophagectomy, with an in-hospital mortality of 2. 5 %. During follow-up, 253 (41. 7 %) patients developed a <b>stricture</b> after a median time of 74 days, requiring a median number of 5 dilations. Cardiovascular disease (P = 0. 002), gastric tube compared with colonic interposition (P = 0. 03), and anastomotic leakage (P = 0. 002) were predictive for development of <b>stricture</b> in multivariate analysis. Development of <b>stricture</b> within 90 days after surgery (P = 0. 001), chemoradiotherapy (P = 0. 02), and anastomotic leakage (P = 0. 03) were independent predictors for refractory <b>strictures</b> requiring over 10 dilations. Conclusions: The benign cervical <b>stricture</b> rate after esophagectomy was relatively high.

50|$|This {{refers to}} {{temperature-controlled}} radiofrequency energy {{being delivered to}} the anal canal, and is marketed as the SECCA procedure. This procedure aims to create a controlled scarring and <b>stricturing</b> of the anal canal. In theory, {{it is thought that}} radiofrequency induced IAS injury may cause collagen deposition and fibrosis (scarring), resulting in the affected area tightening. Specialized surgical instrument called a radiofrequency handpiece is used. It has 4 needles which enter the IAS and heat up to 85 °C. This causes the water molecules in the tissue to vibrate with subsequent frictional heating. The hand piece is cooled by water and monitors the temperature of the tissues it is applied to for safety. It is thought that the improvement in FI occurs over time as collagen is deposited and the tissues undergo remodeling. The procedure is carried out under local anesthesia (with or without conscious sedation) on an outpatient basis. There appear to be relatively few serious complications.Initial studies of the SECCA procedure have shown promising improvements in quality of life and FI severity scores, however large randomized control trials and systematic reviews are currently lacking.|$|E

Even experienced surgeons following strict surgical principles have not achieved optimal results, leading us to think whether the etiology of <b>strictures</b> dictate the outcome. We evaluated this "cause-effect" relationship highlighting {{the significance of the}} etiology on the overall prognosis of urethral <b>strictures.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 302 males with urethral <b>strictures</b> were assessed (both retrospectively and prospectively) over a period of ten years. The preoperative evaluation was performed by retrograde urethrogram, urethrosonogram, and uroflowmetry and categorized, based on etiology: a) as post traumatic, b) post infective, c) iatrogenic or d) unknown. Traumatic <b>strictures</b> were subjected to pelvic X-ray and sub-categorized into grades A, B and C, following the TILE classification. Patients were operated; with tunica albuginea urethroplasty for anterior <b>strictures</b> and U shape prostato-bulbar anastomosis for posterior <b>strictures.</b> RESULTS: Traumatic <b>strictures</b> accounted for 54 % of cases. 127 of the 302 patients were treated using Tunica Albuginea Urethroplasty, while U shaped Prostatobulbar Anastomosis was performed on others.

We hypothesize that patients with buried penis have {{a higher rate of}} urethral <b>stricture</b> and lichen sclerosus than the general population. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed a single surgeon’s (CM) case logs for patients presenting with a buried penis. All patients were evaluated for urethral <b>stricture</b> with cystoscopy or retrograde urethrogram either prior to or at the time of repair for buried penis. Those that had surgical repair or biopsy were reviewed for presence of lichen sclerosus. Results. 39 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 13 (33 %) had associated <b>stricture</b> disease. The location of the <b>strictures</b> was bulbar urethra (38 %), penile urethra (15 %), and meatus or fossa navicularis (62 %).

40|$|Background: Crohn's {{disease is}} a {{heterogeneous}} entity. Disease behaviour, characterised as structuring, penetrating, or non-stricturing non-penetrating, is a clinically important phenotype as it is associated with complications and need for surgery. It has recently been showed that the behaviour of Crohn's disease changes {{over the course of}} the disease. Aim: To assess the association between rapid development of a penetrating or <b>stricturing</b> pattern of Crohn's disease and demographic and clinical characteristics as well as NOD 2 /CARD 15 genotype. Patients and methods: A total of 163 patients with a firm diagnosis of Crohn's disease and who had non-penetrating non-stricturing disease at diagnosis were studied. Various demographic and clinical characteristics as well as anitsaccharomyces cerevisiae antibody status and NOD 2 /CARD 15 genotype were documented in these patients. These characteristics were compared in subgroups of patients according to evolution of disease behaviour five years after diagnosis. Results: Five years after diagnosis there were 110 (67. 5 %) patients with non-structuring non-penetrating disease, 18 (11 %) with <b>stricturing</b> disease, and 35 (21. 5 %) with penetrating disease. In multivariate analysis, only disease location and number of flares per year were significantly discriminant between the three subgroups (p= 0. 0009 and 0. 0001, respectively). Ileal location of the disease was associated with a <b>stricturing</b> pattern while a high number of flares was associated with a penetrating pattern. Active smoking was also associated with a penetrating pattern compared with a non-stricturing non-penetrating pattern only. Conclusions: Early development of <b>stricturing</b> or penetrating behaviour in Crohn's disease is influenced by disease location, clinical activity of the disease, and smoking habit, but not by NOD 2 /CARD 15 genotype.

The objective was to modify technique of balloon dilation for treatment of laryngeal <b>strictures,</b> to estimate what is the influence of dilations on treatment of esophageal and laryngeal <b>strictures,</b> what is appropriate time for evaluation of success rate of esophageal dilations, what is success rate of esophageal and laryngeal dilations one year after last dilation, which factors are decisive for success rate of laryngeal balloon dilations and what is success rate of balloon dilation according to etiology of esophageal <b>strictures.</b> Technique used in balloon dilation of esophageal <b>strictures</b> was successfully modified for dilations of laryngeal <b>strictures.</b> This technique could be used even in apnoea when tracheostomy is absent. Dilations have great influence on success rate of treatment of esophageal <b>strictures,</b> their influence on success rate of treatment of laryngeal <b>strictures</b> is weaker. One year after last dilation is sufficient for evaluation of success rate of dilations. Six month after dilation allowed to estimate which <b>strictures</b> have or have not to undergo surgery. Time of duration of laryngeal <b>stricture</b> before dilation is decisive for success rate of the dilations. Etiology and localization of laryngeal <b>stricture</b> are not so important for success of dilations. Balloon dilation are successful in patient with <b>stricture</b> after surgery repair of esophageal atresia, <b>stricture</b> after fundoplication, <b>stricture</b> due to GER and congenital stenosis. Achalasia is nt indication for dilation. We recommend to attempt dilation, followed by surgery in the case of failure for patient with corrosive <b>stricture.</b> Summary in EnglishAvailable from STL, Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Some biliary <b>strictures</b> may be {{manageable}} by percutaneous interventional radiologic techniques (PIRT), but long-term {{efficacy of}} this approach is scarce. Methods. We reviewed retrospectively all patients with biliary <b>strictures</b> secondary to traumatic bile duct injury or <b>strictured</b> bilioenteric anastomoses. Patients in whom the initial management was by PIRT from 1998 through 2003 were selected. Subjects with sclerosing cholangitis, hepatic transplantation, or malignant <b>strictures</b> were excluded. Data were obtained from medical records and/or direct patient contact. Comparisons were made by Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results. Twenty-seven patients with biliary <b>strictures</b> were treated by PIRT. Mean age was 54 years (range 11 – 86). Most frequent etiology was laparoscopic cholecystectomy injury in 11 patients (41 %). Eight patients (29 %) had undergone biliary resection for malignancy, seven (26 %) a pancreatoduodenectomy, and one for presumed ischemic cholangiopathy; no <b>strictures</b> were secondary to neoplastic recurrence. PIRT was successful in 10 of 11 patients (91 %) with short, isolated bile duct <b>strictures</b> secondary to laparoscopic cholecystectomy and in seven of 15 patients (41 %) with <b>strictured</b> bilioenteric anastomosis, but not in the patient with ischemic cholangiopathy. Twenty patients (74 %) were stent-free at follow-up. Anastomotic biliary <b>strictures</b> were more likely to fail PIRT than isolated <b>strictures</b> secondary to laparoscopic cholecystectomy injury (p= 0. 02). Conclusion. Percutaneous balloon dilatation and stenting can be an effective strategy for patients with bile duct <b>strictures,</b> especially short bile duct <b>strictures</b> after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Anastomotic <b>strictures</b> are associated with less good results when managed by PIRT but are successful in up to 40 % of patients...|$|R
40|$|Urethral <b>strictures</b> are {{difficult}} to manage. Some treatment modalities for urethral <b>strictures</b> are fraught with high patient morbidity and <b>stricture</b> recurrence rates; however, an extremely useful tool in the armamentarium of the Reconstructive Urologist is buccal mucosal urethroplasty. We like buccal mucosa grafts because of its excellent short and long-term results, low post-operative complication rate, and relative ease of use. We utilize it for most our bulbar urethral <b>stricture</b> repairs and some pendulous urethral <b>stricture</b> repairs, usually {{in conjunction with a}} first-stage Johanson repair. In this report, we discuss multiple surgical techniques for repair of urethral <b>stricture</b> disease. Diagnosis, evaluation of candidacy, surgical techniques, post-operative care, and complications are included. The goal is to raise awareness of buccal mucosa grafting for the management urethral <b>stricture</b> disease...|$|R
