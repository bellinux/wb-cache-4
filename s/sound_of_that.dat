5|$|Writing systems {{represent}} language using visual symbols, {{which may}} or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the Inuktitut syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic scripts, each sign represents an entire word, and will generally bear no relation to the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> word in spoken language.|$|E
25|$|In Urdu script, hamza {{does not}} occur at the initial {{position}} over alif since alif is not used as a glottal stop in Urdu. In the middle position, if hamza is surrounded by vowels, it indicates a diphthong between the two vowels. In the middle position, if hamza is surrounded by only one vowel, it takes the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> vowel. In the final position hamza is silent or produces a glottal sound, as in Arabic.|$|E
500|$|The modern English word [...] "lead" [...] is of Germanic origin; {{it comes}} from the Middle English leed and Old English lēad (with the macron above the [...] "e" [...] {{signifying}} that the vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> letter is long). The Old English word is derived from the hypothetical reconstructed Proto-Germanic *lauda- ("lead"). According to linguistic theory, this word bore descendants in multiple Germanic languages of exactly the same meaning.|$|E

500|$|Film score {{composer}} James Newton Howard {{was approached}} by Shyamalan to work on Unbreakable immediately after scoring The Sixth Sense. [...] "He sat there and storyboarded the whole movie for me", Howard said. [...] "I've never had a director do that for me." [...] Shyamalan wanted a [...] "singularity" [...] tone for the music. [...] "He wanted something that was very different, very distinctive, that immediately evoked the movie when people heard it," [...] Howard explained. Howard and Shyamalan chose to simplify the score, and minimized the number of instruments (strings, trumpets and piano), with limited orchestrations. Some compositions were recorded in a converted church in London. [...] "You could have recorded the same music in a studio in Los Angeles, {{and it would have}} been great, but there is something about the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> church studio," [...] Howard remarked. [...] "It's definitely more misterioso." ...|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Ned Raggett {{noted that}} [...] "Early Elvis would have {{approved}} of the music, Wilde of the words", and described the track as [...] "an audacious end result by any standard". Tim DiGravina, of the same organisation, wrote that [...] "Debating {{the merits of the}} track here would be a bit pointless, as it's a classic song from one of the last great classic bands. It might as well be called 'This Charming Song'." [...] In 2007, Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher described the first time he heard the track: [...] "The second I heard 'This Charming Man' everything made sense. The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> guitar intro was incredible. The lyrics are fuckin' amazing, too. People say Morrissey's a miserable cunt, but I knew straight away what he was on about." [...] In 2006, Liz Hoggard from The Independent said that [...] "This Charming Man ... is about age-gap, gay sex".|$|E
500|$|After the mixes were done, Castellon {{began working}} on Timbaland's introduction, and {{continued}} with Madonna and Timberlake's vocals. On Timbaland's vocals, he utilized the SSL's EQ to reduce [...] "some bottom end", and he set input levels to avoid clipping. For Madonna and Timberlake he used SSL's dynamic range compression, and on Madonna's voice he applied [...] "an eighth-note delay from a [...] PCM42", a reverb from Eventide H3500 for the verse, and [...] TC3000 for the hook." [...] These digital signal processors were employed to give Madonna's vocals a sense of stereophonic space. Castellon applied Waves Audio [...] "Renaissance Compressor" [...] plug-in to control the level of kick drum. He recalled that [...] "there was one particular kick sound there that clashed with the other tracks, so Tim replaced it with another kick that had a very different note and sound." [...] Using a Focusrite D2 equalizer let him [...] "match the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> new kick drum to the other kick drum sounds". Once the drums and percussion were added, the recording and mixing of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] was finished.|$|E

500|$|As {{of the end}} of this episode, {{the status}} of three main {{characters}} remained undetermined. Niki Sanders was last seen inside a burning building which subsequently exploded, and Nathan Petrelli was shot while attempting to speak out against the Company. Their fates were left intentionally ambiguous because the writers were unsure of whether they wanted to proceed with Niki and Nathan's characters; decisions were made following the Writers' Strike resolution. As for the fate of Adam Monroe, Kring was more direct, saying [...] "we've given the audience {{no reason to believe that}} Adam can figure a way to get out of there. The fact that he can live forever makes this the most gruesome of internments. If this happened to any of us, at least we'd know we'd soon have the mercy of death. Not here." [...] Two of the series' villains also saw changes. Elle's decision to take on Sylar gave her a chance to use her abilities to help rather than to hurt people. Kring says [...] "she's been given an opportunity to use her powers in a good way. And she absolutely likes the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> word 'hero'." [...] Sylar's use of the stolen sample of Claire Bennet's blood led to the restoration of his abilities. According to Kring, [...] "Sylar getting his power back does not bode well for our heroes." [...] Originally, Sylar was not supposed to get his abilities back due to Zachary Quinto's commitment to the new Star Trek film. However, due to the Writers' Strike, Quinto completed his role in the film by the time Heroes returned to production.|$|E

His experiences both in the studio and with the Yardbirds were very influential in contributing to the success of Led Zeppelin in the 1970s. As a record producer, songwriter, and guitarist he helped make Led Zeppelin a prototype for countless future rock bands and was one of the major driving forces behind the rock <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> era, influencing a host of other guitarists.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{arriving}} at Montserrat, Knopfler had written {{all the songs}} and rehearsed them with the band. The studio lineup included Knopfler (guitar), John Illsley (bass), Terry Williams (drums), Alan Clark (piano and Hammond B3), and Guy Fletcher, who was new to the band, playing a synth rig that consisted of a huge new Yamaha DX1, a couple of Roland keyboards, and a Synclavier. The studio itself was small, with a [...] recording space that offered virtually no isolation. [...] "It was a good-sounding studio," [...] Dorfsman later recalled, [...] "but the main room itself was nothing to write home about. The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> studio was the desk," [...] referring to the Neve 8078 board.|$|E
50|$|The {{languages}} of India and Southeast Asia, {{as well as}} the Ethiopian Semitic languages, have a type of alphabet called an abugida or alphasyllabary. In these scripts, unlike in pure syllabaries, syllables starting with the same consonant are generally expressed with characters that are based on the same sign in a regular way, and usually each character representing a syllable consists of several elements which designate the individual <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> syllable.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the case}} of a musical note, the lowest {{frequency}} of its timbre is designated as the sound's fundamental frequency. For simplicity, we often say that the note is playing at that fundamental frequency (e.g. [...] "middle C is 261.6 Hz"), even though the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> note consists of many other frequencies as well. The set of the remaining frequencies is called the overtones (or the harmonics) of the sound. In other words, the fundamental frequency alone is responsible for the pitch of the note, while the overtones define the timbre of the sound. The overtones of a piano playing middle C will be quite different from the overtones of a violin playing the same note; that's what allows us to differentiate the sounds of the two instruments. There are even subtle differences in timbre between different versions of the same instrument (for example, an upright piano vs. a grand piano).|$|E
2500|$|Quicksilver Messenger Service (sometimes {{credited}} {{as simply}} Quicksilver) is an American psychedelic rock band formed in 1965 in San Francisco. The band achieved wide {{popularity in the}} San Francisco Bay Area and through their recordings, with psychedelic rock enthusiasts around the globe, and several of their albums ranked in the Top 30 of the Billboard Pop charts. They {{were part of the}} new wave of album-oriented bands, achieving renown and popularity despite an almost complete lack of success with their singles, apart from [...] "Fresh Air", which reached number 49 in 1970. Though not as commercially successful as contemporaries Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead, Quicksilver was integral to the beginnings of their genre. With their jazz and classical influences and a strong folk background, the band attempted to create an individual, innovative sound. Music historian Colin Larkin wrote: [...] "Of all the bands {{that came out of the}} San Francisco area during the late '60s, Quicksilver typified most the style, attitude and <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> era." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} old {{instruments}} and historic performance practice {{has taught us}} a great deal, but the main point, the impact of harmony, has been ignored. This is proved {{by the fact that}} tempo is described as an independent phenomenon. It is claimed that one of Bach's gavottes must be played fast and another one slowly. But tempo is not independent! … I think that concerning oneself purely with historic performance practice and the attempt to reproduce the sound of older styles of music-making is limiting and no indication of progress. Mendelssohn and Schumann tried to introduce Bach into their own period, as did Liszt with his transcriptions and Busoni with his arrangements. In America Leopold Stokowski also tried to do it with his arrangements for orchestra. This was always the result of [...] "progressive" [...] efforts to bring Bach closer to the particular period. I have no philosophical problem with someone playing Bach and making it sound like Boulez. My problem is more with someone who tries to imitate the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> time… ...|$|E

One big issue about race is AfricanAmericans were got the racial discrimination {{and they became}} the minority in the United States. The writer wants to examine the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> minority which reflect in Maya Angelou 2 ̆ 7 s poems. The writer chose Maya Angelou 2 ̆ 7 s poem since she is the most influence African-American woman through her works, especially in poetry. The problem to be solved in this study is: how does Maya Angelou reflect the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> African-American <b>that</b> she writes on her poems; Alone, Still I Rise, Caged Bird, and Equality?The writer applies Goldmann 2 ̆ 7 s theory which is genetic structuralism in analyzing the intrinsic and extrinsic element of Maya Angelou 2 ̆ 7 s poems. From Goldmann 2 ̆ 7 s theory it is clearly mentioned that literary work could {{not be separated from}} the intrinsic and extrinsic element because the historical background of the author as the member of social group always give influenced to the work. The result of this research is found that there are three <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> AfricanAmericanthat reflect in Maya Angelou 2 ̆ 7 s poems: First, the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> freedom <b>that</b> represent in Caged Bird, second, the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> equality <b>that</b> represent in Equality, and third, the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> racism <b>that</b> represent in Alone and Still I Rise. In the future, if there is a researcher who would like to analyze the same object, it is suggested to use post-colonial theory. By using post-colonial theory, it will help to reveal the effect <b>of</b> racial discrimination <b>that</b> happen toward African American life and their society...|$|R

[...] Most of Motown's Quality Control Department team also turned the song down, with Balk later stating that [...] "they were used to the 'baby baby' stuff, and this was a little hard for them to grasp."
