5|$|In World War II the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal formed {{part of the}} Taunton <b>Stop</b> <b>Line,</b> {{designed}} to prevent the advance of a German invasion. Pillboxes can still be seen along its length. The first bombs fell on Bridgwater on 24 August 1940, destroying houses on Old Taunton Road, and three men, three women and one child were killed. Later {{a prisoner of war}} camp was established at Colley Lane, holding Italian prisoners. During the preparations for the invasion of Europe, American troops were based in the town.|$|E
5|$|Textile {{manufacture}} {{was important}} to the town during the Middle Ages. Chard is the birthplace of powered flight as in 1848 John Stringfellow first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible. Percy and Ernist Petter, who formed Westland Aircraft Works, witnessed some of Stringfellow's demonstrations in Chard and often asked for help {{in the formation of}} Westland's first aircraft development factory on the outskirts of Yeovil. AgustaWestland now holds the Henson and Stringfellow lecture yearly for the RAeS. James Gillingham developed articulated artificial limbs. Chard is a key point on the Taunton <b>Stop</b> <b>Line,</b> a World War II defensive line.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{construction}} of <b>stopping</b> <b>lines</b> in the branching random walk and thus {{the existence of a}} class of supermartingales indexed by sequences of <b>stopping</b> <b>lines.</b> Applying a method of Lyons (1997) and Lyons, Pemantle and Peres (1995) concerning size biased branching trees, we establish a relationship between <b>stopping</b> <b>lines</b> and certain <b>stopping</b> times. Consequently we develop conditions under which these supermartingales are also martingales. Further we prove a generalization of Biggins' Martingale Convergence Theorem, Biggins (1977 a) within this context...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} some techniques that can be used in the study of stochastic processes which have as parameter set the positive quadrant of the plane R 2 +. We define <b>stopping</b> <b>lines</b> and derive an interesting property of measurability for them. The notion of predictability is developed, and we show the connection between predictable processes, fields associated with <b>stopping</b> <b>lines,</b> and predictable <b>stopping</b> <b>lines.</b> We also give a theorem of section for predictable sets. Extension to processes indexed by any partially ordered set with some regularity assumptions can be carried out quite easily with the same techniques...|$|R
5|$|Chard was a {{key point}} on the Taunton <b>Stop</b> <b>Line,</b> a World War II {{defensive}} line consisting of pillboxes and anti-tank obstacles, which runs from Axminster north to the Somerset coast near Highbridge. In 1938 a bomb proof bunker was built behind the branch of the Westminster Bank. During the war {{it was used to}} hold duplicate copies of the bank records in case its headquarters in London was destroyed. It was also used to store the emergency bank note supply of the Bank of England. There has also been speculation that the Crown Jewels were also stored there, however this has never been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} well {{understood}} by the Dutch that the forces occupying the Grebbe Line would not be sufficiently strong to repel all attacks by themselves; they were intended to delay an offensive long enough for reserves to reinforce them. Due to the failure the previous day {{to understand that the}} German main assault was imminent, these reserves would not arrive in time to intervene in the fight at the defence zone between the two trench systems. This was all the more serious as the <b>Stop</b> <b>Line</b> had no depth and lacked large shelters to accommodate enough troops to stage a strong frontal counterattack. In the late evening it was decided to execute a flank attack from the north the next day.|$|E
5|$|Many Somerset {{soldiers}} {{died during}} the First World War, with the Somerset Light Infantry suffering nearly 5,000 casualties. War memorials were put up {{in most of the}} county's towns and villages; only nine, described as the Thankful Villages, had none of their residents killed. During the Second World War the county was a base for troops preparing for the D-Day landings. Some of the hospitals which were built for the casualties of the war remain in use. The Taunton <b>Stop</b> <b>Line</b> was set up to repel a potential German invasion. The remains of its pill boxes can still be seen along the coast, and south through Ilminster and Chard.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, 207. Infanteriedivision was for {{the first}} time {{committed}} to battle at the Grebbeberg itself when two battalions of its 322. Infanterieregiment attacked the <b>Stop</b> <b>Line.</b> The first wave of German attackers was beaten back with serious losses, but a second wave managed to fragment the trench line, which then was taken after heavy fighting. The regiment subsequently proceeded to mop up the area to the west, delayed by resistance from several Dutch command posts. It withdrew in the late afternoon, just as the SS battalions further north, to avoid a preparatory artillery bombardment, shifted to a more western position. After redeployment the Germans intended to renew their attack in order to take the Rhenen fall-back line and the village of Achterberg. However, these preparations would prove to be superfluous: the Dutch had already disappeared.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War {{hundreds}} of Somerset soldiers were killed, and war memorials were {{put up in}} most of the towns and villages; only a few villages escaped casualties. There were also casualties– though much fewer– during the Second World War, who were added to the memorials. The county was a base for troops preparing for the 1944 D-Day landings, and some Somerset hospitals still date partly from that time. The Royal Ordnance Factory ROF Bridgwater was constructed early in World War II for the Ministry of Supply. It was designed as an Explosive ROF, to produce RDX, which was then a new experimental high-explosive. It obtained water supplies from two sources via the Somerset Levels: the artificial Huntspill River which was dug during the construction of the factory and also from the King's Sedgemoor Drain, which was widened at the same time. The Taunton <b>Stop</b> <b>Line</b> was set up to resist a potential German invasion, and the remains of its pill boxes can still be seen, as well as others along the coast. A decoy town was constructed on Black Down, intended to represent the blazing lights of a town which had neglected to follow the black-out regulations. Sites in the county housed Prisoner of War camps including: Norton Fitzwarren, Barwick, Brockley, Goathurst and Wells. Various airfields were built or converted from civilian use including: RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II), RAF Weston-super-Mare, RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron), Yeovil/Westland Airport, RAF Weston Zoyland, RAF Merryfield, RAF Culmhead and RAF Charmy Down.|$|E
5|$|On {{the extreme}} {{south of the}} Grebbe Line, the Grebbeberg, the Germans were now {{deploying}} three SS battalions including support troops and three fresh infantry battalions of IR.322; two of IR.374 laid in immediate reserve. During the evening and night of 12–13 May the Dutch had assembled in this sector about a dozen battalions. These forces consisted of the reserve battalions of several army corps, divisions and brigades, and the independent Brigade B, which had been freed when the Main Defence Line in the Land van Maas en Waal had been abandoned {{as part of the}} withdrawal of III Army Corps from North Brabant. However, not all of these units would be concentrated into a single effort for a counterattack to retake the main line. Some battalions had been fed immediately into the battle at the <b>Stop</b> <b>Line</b> and others were kept in reserve, mainly behind the fall-back line near the Rhenen railroad. Furthermore, most battalions were a quarter below strength. Four were to be used, under command of Brigade B, for the flanking attack from the north. This attack was delayed for several hours; when it finally started late in the morning of 13 May, it ran right into a comparable advance by two battalions of Der Fuehrer. This brigade, unaware of Dutch intentions, had shifted its attack axis to the north to roll up the Grebbe Line from behind. A confused encounter battle followed in which the vanguard of the Dutch troops, poorly supported by their artillery, began to give way at around 12:30 to the encroaching SS troops. Soon this resulted in a general withdrawal of the brigade, which turned into a rout when, at about 13:30, the Grebbeberg area was bombed by 27 Ju 87 Stukas.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are various}} types of <b>line</b> <b>stopping</b> heads. The oldest and still most widely used method of line {{plugging}} is the pivoting head style <b>line</b> <b>stop.</b> This technology {{dates back to the}} 1930s. The pivot head <b>line</b> <b>stop</b> requires a full size on size hot tap in order to be inserted into the operating piping system. Other methods include the folding head <b>line</b> <b>stop</b> which enters the pipe through a reduced branch hot tap, the Sure-Stop <b>line</b> <b>stop</b> which intersects the pipe and doesn't seal inside the pipe like other methods, and the HTP which is a high temperature, high pressure system that will stop the flow on existing pipes at operating temperatures above what other methods of <b>line</b> <b>stops</b> can safely stop.|$|R

25|$|Some level {{crossings}} that are located close to intersections with traffic lights program the signals with a preemption sequence {{so when the}} approaching train trips the track circuit, it not only activates the crossing signals, but also changes the traffic lights facing the crossing to green, to clear any traffic that may be queued on the crossing. If the intersection's <b>stop</b> <b>line</b> is right before the tracks (typically sharing the crossing's <b>stop</b> <b>line),</b> the track circuits would change the traffic lights to red (often without a yellow phase). Some track circuits place the signals into flash mode the entire time the AWDs are active. In cases where railroads share {{the right of way}} with vehicular traffic, simple railroad preemption may cause an all-red flash in traffic lights.|$|E

25|$|During the Second World War {{a section}} of the GHQ <b>Stop</b> <b>Line,</b> a system of pillboxes, gun emplacements, {{anti-tank}} obstacles and other fortifications, was constructed along the North Downs. This line, running from Somerset to Yorkshire, was intended as the principal fixed defence of London and the industrial core of England against the threat of invasion. German invasion plans envisaged that the main thrust of their advance inland would cross the North Downs at the gap in the ridge formed by the Wey valley, thus colliding with the defence line around Guildford.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day, the Germans mounted their final {{attack against the}} Grebbe Line.

As there were no reserve troops, {{it was clear that}} defeat was imminent: there was nothing between the Germans and the North Sea but the famous Waterlinie (Water Line), which might have stopped Louis XIV of France in 1672, but was only very sketchily prepared in 1940.|$|E
25|$|The {{second type}} of common variant has been {{consistently}} misidentified by the Defence of Britain survey as a Type 27 and {{has led to the}} misconception that there is a Hexagonal variant of that type. The pillbox is actually an enlarged Type 22 with a central AA well and 3ft 6in walls. Documents in the National Archives refer to this type as drawing CRE 1113; a variant form of this type without the central AA well also exists. Another variant Type 22 is referred to as drawing CRE 1094: this is effectively a thin-walled version of CRE 1113, with 1ft 6in thick walls. These types are found mainly along the River Stour <b>stop</b> <b>line,</b> where 113 remain extant.|$|E
