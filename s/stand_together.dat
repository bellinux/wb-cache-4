25|$|The {{ground was}} officially opened in AprIl 1882. Work on the current, redeveloped, all-seater stadium got {{underway}} in February 1993 {{when the old}} Darwen End stand was demolished. This <b>stand,</b> <b>together</b> with the old Blackburn End stand, was then redeveloped before the Nuttall Street stand was also demolished ready for redevelopment in January 1994. Almost two years later, on 18 November 1995, the newly redeveloped Ewood Park was officially opened. With a capacity of 31,367, the facility comprises four sections: the Darwen End, Riverside Stand (named as such because it stands practically {{on the banks of}} the River Darwen), Blackburn End, and Jack Walker Stand, which is named after Blackburn industrialist and club supporter, Jack Walker. The stadium also houses conference and banqueting facilities and was recently the setting for a new Guinness World Record, when a 1 tonne Chicken Samosa was made in recognition of club owners Venkys.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} this, a not legally sanctioned {{referendum}} was held as scheduled, with over 80% voting for independence, albeit {{on a low}} turnout of around 40%. Independence parties considered the result a success. Artur Mas explained in a public act on 25 November his plan to reach independence, proposing calling an extraordinary regional election—turned into an alternative vote on independence—at some point during 2015, {{on the condition that}} ERC agreed to join a common list with his party to <b>stand</b> <b>together</b> at the polls. ERC leader Oriol Junqueras agreed with most of the plan but initially refused such a joint list, threatening to break its government pact with CiU in order to force an election in early 2015. After weeks of calibrated brinkmanship from both sides, with CDC pushing for a joint candidature to cover for its forecasted loss of support and ERC refusing to run with Artur Mas as presidential candidate, both parties finally reached an agreement, and on 14 January 2015, Mas announced that a snap regional election would be held on 27 September that same year, with the intention to turn in into the true plebiscite on independence.|$|E
25|$|The {{result was}} that Philip was {{suspected}} of a tendency toward Zwinglianism. His sympathy for the Reformers associated with Zwingli in Switzerland and Bucer in Strasburg was intensified by the anger of the emperor at receiving from Philip a statement of Protestant tenets composed by the ex-Franciscan Lambert, and the landgrave's failure to secure any common action {{on the part of}} the Protestant powers regarding the approaching Turkish war. Philip eagerly embraced Zwingli's plan of a great Protestant alliance to extend from the Adriatic to Denmark to keep the Holy Roman Emperor from crossing into Germany. This association caused some coldness between himself and the followers of Luther at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, especially when he propounded his irenic policy to Melanchthon and urged that all Protestants should <b>stand</b> <b>together</b> in demanding that a general council alone should decide religious differences. This was supposed to be indicative of Zwinglianism, and Philip soon found it necessary to explain his exact position on the question of the Eucharist, whereupon he declared that he fully agreed with the Lutherans, but disapproved of persecuting the Swiss.|$|E
25|$|The Australian captain Bill Lawry {{chose to}} open with his vice-captain Ian Chappell, {{who did not}} look happy at the prospect, and Keith Stackpole was {{returned}} to the middle order. Strangely, Lawry did not consider opening with fellow-Victorian Ian Redpath during the series, despite having made a double century opening <b>stand</b> <b>together</b> against South Africa. However, in the 1970–71 season Lawry opened the Victorian batting with Keith Stackpole with 'Redders' coming in at number three. Lawry and Chappell were soon out and it was Redpath (64) and Doug Walters (55) who {{made the most of}} Australian's 189/4 by the end of what was regarded as the best day's play of the series. Their stand of 99 was made against the hostile bowling of John Snow (1/23) and Bob Willis (0/26), with the barrackers on the infamous Sydney Hill started hooting and counting Snow out as he bowled a host of short balls. {{in the end it was}} the spinners who did the damage, Walters was caught off Ray Illingworth (1/59) after being deceived in flight. Greg Chappell had just been made Australia's Sportsman of the Year 1970 ahead of Evonne Goolagong, Margaret Court, Heather McKay and Rod Laver, but was caught and bowled by Derek Underwood for 15 and Keith Fletcher caught Redpath off Basil d'Oliveira's off-spin (2/20) just before stumps. Resuming after the rest day Deadly Derek (4/66) dismissed Stackpole, Marsh and Mallett as Australia collapsed to 208/8 and 236 all out, 96 runs behind.|$|E

25|$|He was {{prominent}} in the Fourth Test when he started his pairing with Lawry {{at the top of}} the order at Old Trafford. An Australian victory would result in a 2–1 lead and the retention of the Ashes. Their first Test <b>stand</b> <b>together</b> was not successful; Simpson fell for four as Australia made only 190. After taking 4/23 in the English first innings, removing Ken Barrington for 78 and cleaning up the tail with three more wickets, despite which England had a first-innings lead of 177. He scored 51 in the second innings in a century stand with Lawry—the first by either team in the series—which allowed Australia to reach set a winning target on the last day. Early on, England appeared destined for the target, as Dexter plundered 21 from Simpson's first four overs. However, the English batsman fell and Simpson did not concede a run in his remaining four overs. He claimed the wicket of Fred Trueman as England collapsed to be all out for 201 on the final afternoon to cede the Ashes. After the triumph at Old Trafford, Simpson had a run of heavy-scoring in the county matches before the final Test, scoring 116, 132 and 6, and 160, ending unbeaten in all but the last innings, against Glamorgan, Warwickshire and Yorkshire. He added a further 3/21 and 3/48 in the last of these matches, although the hosts still managed to hang on for a draw.|$|E

In 1895, 4 December was declared [...] "Shangani Day", an annual Rhodesian public holiday which endured until 1920, when it was folded into Occupation Day, a national non-work day which commemorated several early colonial events together. Shangani Day remained part of the national calendar, however, and was still marked each year.|$|E
