60|$|This is the arresting and {{dominant}} {{fact about}} modern social discussion; that the quarrel {{is not merely}} about the difficulties, but about the aim. We agree about the evil; {{it is about the}} good that we should tear each other's eyes out. We all admit that a lazy aristocracy is a bad thing. We should not by any means all admit that an active aristocracy would be a good thing. We all feel angry with an irreligious priesthood; but some of us would go mad with disgust at a really religious one. Everyone is indignant if our army is weak, including the people who would be even more indignant if it were strong. The <b>social</b> <b>case</b> is exactly the opposite of the medical case. We do not disagree, like doctors, about the precise nature of the illness, while agreeing about the nature of health. On the contrary, we all agree that England is unhealthy, but half of us would not look at her in what the other half would call blooming health. Public abuses are so prominent and pestilent that they sweep all generous people into a sort of fictitious unanimity. We forget that, while we agree about the abuses of things, we should differ very much about the uses of them. Mr. Cadbury and I would agree about the bad public house. It would be precisely in front of the good public-house that our painful personal fracas would occur.|$|E

40|$|This was a {{cross-sectional}} {{descriptive study}} of in-patients {{over the age}} of 60 years at St. Luke's hospital who were deemed to be <b>social</b> <b>cases</b> (SC). The majority (58. 4 %) were female and the mean age was 80 years (range 60 - 92, SD: 6. 7 years). Most (80 %) were found in medical wards. The mean length of stay was 22. 5 days (range 1 - 290 days, SD: 36. 4 days). <b>Social</b> <b>cases</b> were a frail group with a mean number of co-morbidities of 2. 8 (range 0 - 6, SD: 1. 5). Dependency level was also high with a mean Barthel score of 6. 8 (range 0 - 20, SD: 7. 4). A diagnosis of dementia was documented on the patient's medical record in only 12 %. However significant low Abbreviated Mental Test scores were found in 64 % (mean AMT 5. 0, range 0 - 9, SD: 2. 8). These findings illustrate that most <b>social</b> <b>cases</b> at St. Luke's Hospital are not only there for `social' reasons but also have other factors involved, including a high dependency level in activities of daily living which hamper their discharge to the community.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{learning}} methods these agents can be deployed with: social learning and individual learning. In social learning, each firm is endowed with a single string which is used as its quantity production decision. It then compares this string against other firms' strings. In the individual learning case, agents are endowed with a pool of strings. These strings are then compared against other strings within the agent's population pool. This {{can be thought of as}} mutual competing ideas within a firm whereas in the <b>social</b> <b>case,</b> it can be thought of as a firm learning from more successful firms. Note that in the <b>social</b> <b>case</b> and in the individual learning case with identical cost functions, that this is a homogeneous solution, that is all agents' production decisions are identical. However, if the cost functions are not identical, this will result in a heterogeneous solution, where firms produce different quantities (note that they are still locally homogeneous, that is within the firm's own pool all the strings are identical).|$|E

50|$|Some {{books she}} {{published}} with her ideas: Friendly Visiting among the Poor, Social Diagnosis and What is <b>Social</b> <b>Case</b> Work. Within these books she demonstrated {{her understanding of}} social casework. She believed {{in the relationship between}} people and their social environment as the major factor of their life situation or status. Her ideas were based on social theory and that social problems for a family or individual should be looked at by first looking at the individual or family, then including their closest social ties such as families, schools, churches, jobs, etc. After looking at these factors the community and government should be looked at. This will dictate the norms for the person to help determine how to help the person make adjustments to improve their situation. Richmond focused on the strengths of the person rather than blaming them for the bad. Her focus was mostly on children, medical social work, and families. All of her ideas are now the basis for social work education today.|$|E

50|$|Social {{casework}} is {{a primary}} approach and method of social work, concerned with the adjustment {{and development of the}} individual and, in some instances couples, towards more satisfying human relations. In <b>Social</b> <b>case</b> work relationship is the medium through which changes are brought in the behaviour and personality of the client. The social casework relationship is the dynamic interaction of attitudes and emotions between the social caseworker and the client with the purpose of satisfying the clients psychosocial needs to achieve a better intrapersonal (interactions and transactions) adjustment by the client within the respective environment. Psychosocial assessment is a key tool used in casework; it is the initial assessment of a client's current, relevant past and possible future modes of adaptation to stressful situations and normal living situations. Problem solving is the intent behind every social casework process; the caseworker doesn't solve the problem for the client, but helps the person in the situation to be equipped in solving or facing the problem adequately within the individual's weaknesses and strengths to the end of overall development.|$|E
