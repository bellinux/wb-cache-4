50|$|The manner {{by which}} Article 66 was handled left {{the issue of}} the port of Rijeka (Fiume) unresolved. Croatia <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as part of its territory, but Hungary <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as Corpus separatum.|$|R

60|$|Intimately as {{he knows}} Sir Percival, and closely as {{he appears to}} be {{associated}} with Sir Percival's private affairs in general, he is certainly as far as I am from knowing anything of the true story of Anne Catherick. The unsolved mystery in connection with this unhappy woman is now rendered doubly suspicious, in my eyes, by the absolute conviction which I feel, that the clue to <b>it</b> has been <b>hidden</b> by Sir Percival from the most intimate friend he has in the world. It was impossible to mistake the eager curiosity of the Count's look and manner while he drank in greedily every word that fell from my lips.
