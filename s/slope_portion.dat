50|$|Long Lake Wetland Management District {{encompasses}} three {{counties in}} south-central North Dakota, an area famed for its wealth of waterfowl-producing potholes and native prairie grasslands. Headquarters for the Wetland Management District {{is located in}} the Long Lake National Wildlife Refuge office near Moffit, North Dakota, which is about 35 miles southeast of Bismarck. Topographical landforms of the area include Missouri Coteau and Missouri River Slope. Precipitation averages just under 16 inches per year. Approximately 68 percent of the land in the three county area remains virgin sod - native mixed-grass prairie. The dominant land use is cattle grazing. The Coteau wetlands found in the northeastern portion of the Wetland Management District are classic prairie potholes of various sizes and types that are prime duck production habitat. These areas, when wet, are very productive. Soils in this area are generally deep and quite productive. Due to the rolling nature of the landscape on the Coteau, a lot of the land is also characterized as highly erodible. Conversely, many of the wetlands on Missouri River <b>Slope</b> <b>portion</b> of the Wetland Management District are large semi-permanent and permanent alkali wetlands. There are 21 wetland sites on the Missouri River Slope that have a history of periodic avian botulism outbreaks. These areas occasionally present localized problems for significant numbers of migratory birds. Soils on the Missouri River Slope are characteristically shallow with high proportions of sand and gravel. Much of the land is highly erodible. Since 1985, substantial land acreage in the three county area that was once farmed has been retired to Conservation Reserve Program grasslands. The program has assisted in restoring waterfowl populations for many species in the Wetland Management District which exceed the highest level ever recorded since surveys began.|$|E

40|$|Heart valves {{demonstrate}} a characteristic stress-strain curve {{with a low}} <b>slope</b> <b>portion,</b> in which collagen fibers uncrimp, and a high slope region, in which the uncrimped collagen fibers bear load. The acuteness of the transition between these two regions depends upon collagen fiber alignment. We assessed the radius of transition curvature (RoTC) {{as an indicator of}} differences in collagen fiber alignment of porcine aortic and mitral valves (AV, MV, n= 46 hearts) with age (6 weeks, 6 months, 6 years) in both the radial and circumferential directions. The RoTC of radial strips was 3 - 5 times greater than that of circumferential strips. Radially, RoTC was greater in the AV than in MV. Circumferentially, RoTC was lowest {{in the center of the}} MV anterior leaflet (MVAC), followed by AV, and then the free edge of the MV anterior leaflet. RoTC decreased with age, particularly in AV radial strips, likely due to age-related increases in collagen alignment and crosslinking. These findings are consistent with circumferentially oriented collagen fibers within valves, especially the high collagen fiber alignment in the MVAC. In conclusion, RoTC is an easily calculated parameter that may be useful in characterizing the orientation of fibers and the matrix composition of biological materials...|$|E

The lakes were {{subject of a}} long-term monitoring to detect changes of chemical and biotic composition of lake water induced by acid atmospheric deposition and by its decline.

The definition of new catchment parameters or the refining estimated parameters was not allowed without current technical and computing equipment because of the complexity of mountainous terrain.

40|$|The flowslide is {{reproduced}} by the quasi-real scale model-slope {{tests on}} river sand by artificial rainfall, in which subsurface water movement and downslope deformation are carefully monitored. The rainfall at {{the intensity of}} 100 mm/hour on the specimen formed at loose state (9. 0 -metre long, 1. 0 -metre wide, 0. 5 metre deep) have brought about the failure at 2, 931 sec after the onset of sprinkling. Firstly, the pore-fluid has descended gradually leading to the parallel wetting-front to the base, and the sand specimen has been susceptible to the vertical contraction. From 300 sec before the failure, the equi-potential lines started to bend normally to the model-slope base and the pore-fluid has been subject to downslope flow. At the same time, the soil strain in deep layer has considerably started. The most severe creep deformation has been produced in the deep layer among the upper <b>slope</b> <b>portion</b> on steep slope and the failure has been initiated within this section. The excess pore-pressure has not been observed in the source area. Whereas, severe excessive pressure head has been generated due to the collision of the failed upper slope-mass, leading to liquidization. It suggests that the dependence of flowslide generation must be on the dynamic changes in pore-pressure not in the source area but in the compressed lower slope-section...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we aim on a {{reconstruction}} of mechanisms and kinematics of slope-failure and mass-movement processes along the northeastern slope of Crete in the Hellenic forearc, eastern Mediterranean. Here, subsidence of the forearc basin and the uplift of the island of Crete cause ongoing steepening of the slope in-between. The high level of neotectonic activity in this region is expected to exert {{a key role in}} slope-failure development. Newly acquired reflection seismic data from the upper slope region reveal an intact sediment cover while the lower slope is devoid of both intact strata and mass-transport deposits (MTDs). In a mid-slope position, however, we found evidence for a ∼ 4 -km³-sized landslide complex that comprises several MTDs from translational transport of coherent sediment bodies over short distances. Morphometric analysis of these MTDs and their source scars indicates that this part of the northeast Cretan slope can be characterized as a cohesive slope. Furthermore, we reconstruct retrogressive development for this complex and determine a critical slope angle for both pre-conditioning of failure and subsequent landslide deposition near source scars. Consequently, data imply that the investigated shallower slope is stable due to low angles in the order of 3 °, whereas 5 °-inclined mid-slope portions favour both slope destabilization and landslide deposition. The failed mid-slope parts are dominated by sediment truncations from faults almost correlating with the orientation of head- and sidewalls of scars. We suggest that cohesive landslides and MTDs are generated and preserved, respectively, in such critical slope regions. If once generated, cohesive landslides reach the lower slope further downslope that exceeds the threshold gradient for MTD deposition (∼ 5 °), they are transported {{all the way down to}} the foot of the slope and disintegrate to mass flows. From these observations we suggest that the mass-wasting history of the investigated Cretan slope area over a longer period of time is characterized by repeated sediment erosion and transport into the deeper Cretan Sea basin. The relocation of the critical <b>slope</b> <b>portion</b> in upslope direction and therefore recurrence of mass-wasting events is thereby likely controlled by the progressive steepening of the slope. This mechanism and restriction of sediment failure to narrow, critically-inclined and relocating slope portions likely explains how such an active margin setting can exhibit only scarce findings of MTDs on the slope despite an expected, extensive and widespread mass wasting...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} to aid to examine and {{consider}} the initiation conditions, dynamic properties and depositional characters of a dry fragment flow which {{is a kind of}} grain flow, and the relationship of the dry fragment flow to a talus slope, by means of the flield observation at Ashio, Japan and the laboratory experiment using a model talus. First of all, field observations show that the occurrence of dry fragment flows is resulted from the grain flow originated already in a chute cut on a free face behind {{in the case of a}} successive connection of an an apex of the talus slope and the end of the chute, and is caused by impact due to rockfall and removal of the surficial fine materials consisting the talus materials due to windblow which was observed especially in a dryer winter season. Field observations also make clear that the smooth surface of the fines on the upper part of talus slope, formed by dry fragment flows, provides a possibility for the following occurrences of the movement of coarser rock fragments superposed on it. On the other hand, the laboratory experiment suggests that the talus slope of the fines has an initiation of dry fragment flows on a shorter slope or a shoter slope segment and the coarser talus do it on a longer one. This fact makes a possibility for an explanation of the frequent occurrences of the flows on a long talus of the fines as grus. The above results appear also to explain frequent initiations of the dry fragment flows on the upper part of the slope, especially at the talus slope with grain size grading. Since the dry fragment flow posses a downward percolation of the fine materials in its motion to result in reverse grading structure, this mechanism is thought to cause the flow to allow to continue its movement over a long distance on the coarser surface than the grain size of the flow layer itself. It is stressed furthermore that differentiation of the lower fine materials and the upper coarser ones in the dry fragment flow deposit is unreasonable because a set of them indicate a flow unit of the dry fragment flow. Contributions of the dry fragment flow to the talus slope may depend upon the grain size and its distribution of rock fragments supplied from a free face; if the talus slope has contineous supply of fine materials such as gruse, the slope segments beyond the critical slope length mentioned above would develop due to dry fragment flows. If the talus slope, on the other hand, takes a wide range of grain size of rock fragments, the talus slope may develop by rockfall process to show grain size grading. Under such a slope condition the dry fragment flows would play a significant role to transfer the fine materials down toward the lower <b>slope</b> <b>portion</b> where is covered by coarser materials deposited by rolling andor jumping of rock debris fallen onto the talus slope...|$|E

40|$|It was {{hypothesized}} that applying the polymer-induced liquid-precursor (PILP) system to artificial lesions would result in time-dependent functional remineralization of carious dentin lesions that restores the mechanical properties of demineralized dentin matrix. 140 µm deep artificial caries lesions were remineralized via the PILP process for 7 - 28 days at 37 °C to determine temporal remineralization characteristics. Poly-L-aspartic acid (27 KDa) {{was used as the}} polymeric process-directing agent and was added to the remineralization solution at a calcium-to-phosphate ratio of 2. 14 (mol/mol). Nanomechanical properties of hydrated artificial lesions had a low reduced elastic modulus (E(R) = 0. 2 GPa) region extending about 70 μm into the lesion, with a sloped region to about 140 μm where values reached normal dentin (18 - 20 GPa). After 7 days specimens recovered mechanical properties in the sloped region by 51 % compared to the artificial lesion. Between 7 - 14 days, recovery of the outer portion of the lesion continued to a level of about 10 GPa with 74 % improvement. 28 days of PILP mineralization resulted in 91 % improvement of E(R) compared to the artificial lesion. These differences were statistically significant as determined from change-point diagrams.
