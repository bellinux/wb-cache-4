50|$|International {{fast-food}} restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's {{have had a}} variety of fish <b>sandwiches</b> in their product portfolio since 1975. The Whaler <b>sandwich</b> was the first iteration, designed to compete with rival burger-chain McDonald's Filet-O-Fish <b>sandwich.</b> With {{the addition of the}} company's Specialty <b>Sandwich</b> line in 1978, the <b>sandwich</b> was reformulated as the Long Fish <b>sandwich.</b> With the discontinuation of the Specialty <b>Sandwich</b> line, the <b>sandwich</b> was returned to its original recipe and name. With the introduction of the company's BK Broiler chicken <b>sandwich</b> in 1990, the fish <b>sandwich</b> became tied to the development cycle of the broiled chicken <b>sandwich</b> and was again reformulated and renamed as the Ocean Catch Fish fillet. When the broiled chicken <b>sandwich</b> underwent another reformulation in 2002, the fish <b>sandwich</b> was also redone and renamed as the BK Big Fish <b>sandwich.</b> By 2015, the <b>sandwich</b> had undergone several more modifications and went through a series of names including the BK Fish and Premium Alaskan fish <b>sandwich.</b> It is currently sold as the BK Big Fish <b>sandwich</b> in the United States and Canada.

5|$|Although the {{ingredients}} of the BLT have existed for many years, {{there is little evidence}} of BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900. In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a slice of turkey <b>sandwiched</b> between two slices of bread. Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.|$|E

5|$|Protactinium(IV) forms a {{tetrahedral}} complex tetrakis(cyclopentadienyl)protactinium(IV) (or Pa(C5H5)4) {{with four}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting protactinium(IV) chloride with molten Be(C5H5)2. One ring can be substituted with a halide atom. Another organometallic complex is golden-yellow bis(π-cyclooctatetraene) protactinium, or protactinocene, Pa(C8H8)2, which is analogous in structure to uranocene. There, the metal atom is <b>sandwiched</b> between two cyclooctatetraene ligands. Similar to uranocene, it can be prepared by reacting protactinium tetrachloride with dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide, K2C8H8, in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E

5|$|The Nama {{assemblage}} is best {{represented in}} Namibia. Three-dimensional preservation is most common, with organisms preserved in sandy beds containing internal bedding. Dima Grazhdankin believes that these fossils represent burrowing organisms, while Guy Narbonne maintains they were surface dwellers. These beds are <b>sandwiched</b> between units comprising interbedded sandstones, siltstones and shales – with microbial mats, where present, usually containing the fossils. The environment is interpreted as sand bars formed {{at the mouth}} of a delta's distributaries.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Sandwich</b> bread (also {{referred}} to as <b>sandwich</b> loaf) is bread that is prepared specifically {{to be used for}} the preparation of <b>sandwiches.</b> <b>Sandwich</b> breads are produced in many varieties, such as white, whole wheat, sourdough, rye, multigrain and others. <b>Sandwich</b> bread may be formulated to slice easily, cleanly or uniformly, and may have a fine crumb (the soft, inner part of bread) and a light texture. <b>Sandwich</b> bread may be designed to have a balanced proportion of crumb and crust, whereby the bread holds and supports fillings in place and reduces drips and messiness. Some may be designed to not become crumbly, hardened, dried or have too squishy a texture. <b>Sandwich</b> bread can refer to cross-sectionally square, sliced white and wheat bread, which has been described as [...] "perfectly designed for holding square luncheon meat". The bread used for preparing finger <b>sandwiches</b> is sometimes {{referred to}} as <b>sandwich</b> bread. Pan de mie is a <b>sandwich</b> loaf. Some <b>sandwich</b> breads are designed for use in the creation of specific types of <b>sandwiches,</b> such as the submarine <b>sandwich.</b> For barbecuing, use of a high-quality white <b>sandwich</b> bread has been described as suitable for toasting over a fire.

5|$|Erosion-resistant basalt {{underlies}} much of the watershed, {{and streams}} passing over it are relatively free of sediments. However, turbidity increases when unstable soils <b>sandwiched</b> between layers of basalt and other volcanic rocks are disturbed and wash into the river during rainstorms. Despite legal protections, about 22percent of the protected zone was logged {{during the second half}} of the 20thcentury, and erosion increased. For a time in 1996, Portland had to shut down the Bull Run supply because of turbidity and switch to water from wells. A law passed later that year prohibited most logging in or near the watershed, and since then the Portland Water Bureau and the United States Forest Service have closed many of the logging roads and removed culverts and other infrastructure contributing to erosion.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} primarily of silicate rock and water ice, and a salt-water ocean {{is believed to}} exist nearly 200km below Ganymede's surface, <b>sandwiched</b> between layers of ice. The metallic core of Ganymede suggests a greater heat {{at some time in}} its past than had previously been proposed. The surface is a mix of two types of terrain—highly cratered dark regions and younger, but still ancient, regions with a large array of grooves and ridges. Ganymede has a high number of craters, but many are gone or barely visible due to its icy crust forming over them. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone), and some atomic hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of an epidermal layer, a jellylike mesogloea layer and an inner gastrodermis; the septa are infoldings of the body wall and consist of a layer of mesogloea <b>sandwiched</b> between two layers of gastrodermis. In some taxa, sphincter muscles in the mesogloea close over the oral disc and act to keep the polyp fully retracted. The tentacles contain extensions of the coelenteron and have sheets of longitudinal muscles in their walls. The oral disc has radial muscles in the epidermis, {{but most of the}} muscles in the column are gastrodermal, and include strong retractor muscles beside the septa. The number and arrangement of the septa, as well as the arrangement of these retractor muscles, are important in anthozoan classification.|$|E
