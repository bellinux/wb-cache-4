Instead of targeting specific markets, the analysis suggests that restaurant brand managers should take a mass marketing approach. The study examines the 2 ̆ 2 Consumer Picks 2 ̆ 2 survey data collected by WD Partners and the National Restaurant Association {{to determine the extent}} to which a particular restaurant brand shares its customers with other restaurant brands. The analysis finds that the extent of sharing is almost completely explained by the restaurants’ market share, rather than by market targeting. Five sets of restaurants were tested: (1) hamburger quick-service restaurants (QSRs); (2) chicken, Mexican, and pizza QSRs; (3) fast casual concepts; (4) full-service casual restaurants; and (5) table-service restaurants. Each restaurant brand shared its customers with the other brands in proportion to the other brands’ shares of customers and in inverse proportion to its own share of customers. While some restaurant brands <b>shared</b> <b>customers</b> substantially more or less than expected given the sizes of their customer bases, these cases did not occur more frequently than one would expect from chance. This pattern of data suggests that the different restaurant brands do not attract substantially different types of consumers, which in turn suggests that restaurant brands should aim most of their marketing efforts at increasing their appeal to all restaurant customers. That is, most of restaurant marketers’ time, energy and money should be devoted to mass marketing and not targeting subsets of consumers...|$|E

In a fluid limit, a control producing asymptotic SSC corresponds to an ideal {{sliding mode control}} that forces the fluid trajectories to a lower-dimensional sliding manifold. Within deterministic dynamical systems theory, {{it is well known}} that sliding-mode controls can cause the system to chatter back and forth along the sliding manifold due to delays in activation of the control. For the prelimit stochastic system, chattering implies fluid-scaled fluctuations that are larger than typical stochastic fluctuations. In this paper we show that chattering can occur in the fluid limit of a con-trolled stochastic network when inappropriate control parameters are used. The model has two large service pools operating under the fixed-queue-ratio with activation and release thresholds (FQR-ART) overload control which we proposed in a recent paper. The FQR-ART control is designed to produce asymptotic SSC by automatically activating sharing (sending some customers from one class to the other service pool) once an overload occurs. We have previously shown that this control is effective and robust, even if the service rates are less for the other <b>shared</b> <b>customers,</b> when the control parameters are chosen properly. We now show that, if the control parameters are not cho-sen properly, then delays in activating and releasing the control can cause chattering with large oscillations in the fluid limit. In turn, these fluid-scaled fluctuations lead to severe congestion, even when the arrival rates are smaller than the potential total service rate in the system, a phenomenon referred to as congestion collapse. We show that the fluid limit can be a bi-stable switching system possessing a unique nontrivial periodic equilibrium, in addition to a unique stationary point. 1. Introduction. I...|$|E

40|$|Amidst a {{considerable}} {{body of literature}} on erotic dance, the voices of third parties, that is, the people who organize, supervise, manage or coordinate the labour of dancers, seldom appear. Yet, these third parties provide a setting and services that are vital to dancers’ entrepreneurial success. Furthermore, perceptions of third parties as exploitative and coercive perpetuate framings of erotic dance – and sex work in general – as harmful, which in turn invisibilize dancers’ work, {{as well as their}} skills, labour rights and grievances. Drawing from qualitative interviews with 15 third parties and 15 dancers, as well as regional regulatory texts, this dissertation seeks to trouble these stigmatic assumptions by shedding light on the work of third parties and the organization of labour in Ontario’s erotic dance sector. Mapping the occupational roles and relationships amongst third parties (e. g., managers, bouncers, disc jockeys) reveals the organizational structure and peripheries of the strip club. Through this map, we see how third parties together form the organizational structure, which operates as a parallel entity to dancers who, as independent contractors, are for the most part responsible for their own work activities and income. At the same time, because dancers and third parties must equally provide quality service to their <b>shared</b> <b>customers,</b> they are both interdependent on, and independent of, each other. This relationship ‘plays out’ through occupational and situationally adaptive performances, which reiterate and resist normative gender, racial, and class scripts to produce the ‘party’ environment of the strip club. Simultaneously ambiance and organizational culture, the ‘party’ environment shapes third parties’ and dancers’ occupational performances for, and perceptions of, each other. The continuity of performance required to maintain this environment also results in third parties reproducing certain regulatory discourses and mechanisms in their surveillance and rule enforcement practices, and disregarding and subverting others, which in turn impacts upon dancers’ safety. Third parties’ relationships with each other and dancers are also permeated by stigma, stereotypes and perceptions of risk that echo regulatory and broader social discourses. These findings demonstrate that third parties’ engagement with regulation and normative discourses are deeply inter-related and impact the quality of the services they provide to dancers. On this basis it is argued that the context and conditions of dancers’ labour will be improved by rethinking narrow-minded regulatory frameworks and social norms...|$|E

Taking a strong stance on consumer rights, the bill would further forbid private businesses from <b>sharing</b> <b>customer</b> location data without explicit consent of the individual. The bill would cover real-time tracking data as well as previously acquired historical location data.|$|R

40|$|Business {{marketers}} increasingly pursue greater {{shares of}} their customers' business. While {{the merits of}} such a strategy are straight forward from a supplier perspective, this paper aims to explore its consequences from the customer's point-of-view. Design/methodology/approach : Drawing on resource-dependence theory, value and dependence are established as fundamental characteristics of buyer-seller relationships. Data envelopment analysis {{is used as a}} benchmarking tool to integrate these characteristics into a common efficiency scoreindicating the customer-perceived attractiveness of a sourcing relationship. A post-DEA-regression-analysis explores the link between sourcingattractiveness and relative <b>customer</b> <b>share.</b> Findings : This research suggests a quadratic relationship between sourcing attractiveness and relative <b>customer</b> <b>share.</b> The perceived level ofsourcing attractiveness improves until the local maximum is reached and declines beyond a relative <b>customer</b> <b>share</b> of 61. 33 per cent. Research limitations/implications : Additional fraction of variability (R 2) in sourcing attractiveness explained by <b>customer</b> <b>share</b> displays a modest,yet substantial, level. Studies on <b>customer</b> <b>share</b> in comparable contexts found similarly low levels. Practical implications : Sourcing attractiveness provides an interesting metric for assisting managers in their decision-making. Instead of comparingsupplier relationships across the board, the proposed approach allows to compare relationships against their best-in-class benchmark. Findings suggest {{that the vast majority of}} supplier relationships still offers avenues for further improving the existing supply bases. Pushing the <b>share</b> of <b>customer</b> beyondits optimum level, however, will have negative consequences for the customer-perceived attractiveness of the sourcing relationship. Originality/value : The paper contributes to a better understanding of the consequences of <b>customer</b> <b>share</b> marketing from the customer's perspective...|$|R

One {{of the results}} is that the <b>share</b> of <b>customers</b> that enjoys 24-hour water supply increased from 32 percent in 2007 to 71 percent in early 2011. The <b>share</b> of <b>customers</b> that receive water with a pressure of more than 7 {{pounds per square inch}} - which is less than half the pressure required by the concession contract - increased from 53 percent in 2007 to 95 percent in September 2011.|$|R
30|$|We define {{retention}} rate of a shop as the <b>share</b> of the <b>customers</b> that have that shop as closest and favorite. On the other hand, the catch rate of a shop is the <b>share</b> of <b>customers</b> that have that shop as favorite {{even if it}} is not their closest one. The retention and catch rates are calculated for every shop and product type, showing the diverging patterns we described before.|$|R
