50|$|Banca Finnat is {{a company}} that {{provides}} investment services to institutional, private and corporate customers; it is listed on the Italian Stock Exchange. The Bank’s origins date back to 1898, when the company was founded by the Nattino family, initially as a finance company. Banca Finnat then became a brokerage company,a real estate brokerage company and lastly, since 12 February 1998, an intermediary bank. Banca Finnat is today listed in the <b>STAR</b> <b>section</b> of the Borsa Italiana-London Stock Exchange.|$|E
50|$|More {{recently}} the BAA has worked increasingly with international partners. Modern communications allow astronomers in different timezones {{around the world}} to hand over the monitoring of variable stars and planetary weather systems to colleagues on other continents as the Sun comes up, resulting in a 24-hour watch on the sky. For example, the Association's Variable <b>Star</b> <b>Section</b> works closely with the American Association of Variable Star Observers, meanwhile its Jupiter Section works with a global network of planetary observers through the JUPOS collaboration.|$|E

50|$|It has a cupola shape, {{which extends}} from a {{cylindrical}} base {{and is usually}} about 12-15 cm high for a panettone weighing 1 kg. Other bases may be used, such as an octagon, or a frustum with a <b>star</b> <b>section</b> shape more common to pandoro. It is made during a long process that involves curing the dough, which is acidic, similar to sourdough. The proofing process alone takes several days, giving the cake its distinctive fluffy characteristics. It contains candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as raisins, which are added dry and not soaked. Many other variations are available such as plain or with chocolate. It is served in wedge shapes, vertically cut, accompanied with sweet hot beverages or a sweet wine, such as Asti or Moscato d'Asti. In some regions of Italy, it is served with crema di mascarpone, a cream made from mascarpone, eggs, sometimes dried or candied fruits, and typically a sweet liqueur such as amaretto; if mascarpone cheese is unavailable, zabaione is sometimes used as a substitute.|$|E
40|$|The BAA Variable <b>Star</b> <b>Section</b> is the world's longest {{established}} organisation for {{the systematic}} observation of variable stars, having been formed in 1890. Its database contains nearly 3 million measurements {{going back to}} 1840 and is an important resource for researchers. The aim of this Presidential Address is to reveal some of the lesser known tales that lie deep within the database. This includes bringing to life stories {{about some of the}} people that were involved, especially in the early years, including Joseph Baxendell, Mary Adela Blagg and Arthur Stanley Williams, as well as shedding light on some of the stars that have been observed. Finally we look to the future as the Variable <b>Star</b> <b>Section</b> builds on the legacy of its forebears, ensuring that it shall always stay ahead of the curve. Comment: 33 pages, 25 Figures.

He demonstrated that the companion of Sirius, thought {{by many to be}} a dark body, was in fact self luminous.
