In this case, [...] "Planned Parenthood" [...] was the Southeast Pennsylvania Chapter, and [...] "Casey" [...] was Robert Casey, the governor of Pennsylvania. The ultimate ruling was split, and Roe v. Wade was narrowed but upheld in an opinion written by Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter. Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens concurred with the main decision in separately written opinions. The Supreme Court struck down <b>spousal</b> <b>consent</b> requirements for married women to obtain abortions, but found no [...] "undue burden"—an alternative to strict scrutiny, which tests the allowable limitations on rights protected under the Constitution—from the other statutory requirements. Dissenting were William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Byron White. Blackmun, Rehnquist, and White were the only justices who voted on the original Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 who were still on the Supreme Court to rule on this case, and their votes on this case were consistent with their votes on the original decision that legalized abortion.

5000|$|Most {{states in}} the U.S. {{regulate}} the use of alcohol by those {{under the age of}} 21. Many believe that anyone under the age of twenty-one can not consume alcohol in the United States. However, this is incorrect because underage drinking is allowed in 31 states with parental consent and 17 states with <b>spousal</b> <b>consent,</b> if the consenting spouse is over 21. Although the state laws pertaining to drinking by minors (defined as those under the age of 18) are presumptively constitutional, as valid exercises of the police power, to protect public health, welfare, and morals, there exists a question of whether laws forbidding the consumption of alcohol by those 18 to 20 years of age are Constitutional, as such individuals are considered legal adults {{for all intents and purposes}} other than that of consuming alcohol and running for certain State and Federal offices, such as the Presidency of the United States, which is restricted for those 35 years of age and older.

40|$|Modern {{thinking}} on abortion, reflected in recent legal developments around the world, has turned from concentration upon criminality {{in favor of}} female and family well-being.

Regulations governing the delivery of services may be restrictive, however, so as to limit in practice access to means of safe, legal abortion made available in theory. Requirements may be imposed that only medical personnel with unduly high qualifications perform procedures, or that they be undertaken only in institutions meeting standards higher than similar health care requires. Approval procedures may be established involving second medical opinions or committees to monitor observance of the law, which may delay abortions and therefore increase their hazards.

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} role of spousal {{discordance}} in fertility preferences in explaining low rates of contraceptive use and high rates of unwanted births through a field experiment in Zambia. We randomly assigned married women to receive, either alone (“Individual ” treatment) or {{in the presence of}} their husbands (“Couples ” treatment), a voucher that guaranteed ease of access to modern contraceptives. Women in the Individual treatment were 23 % more likely to visit a family planning nurse and 28 % more likely to receive a concealable form of contraception, leading to a 57 % reduction in unwanted births. Meanwhile, providing cheaper and more convenient forms of birth control led to a reduction in unwanted births only when women were also given full autonomy over accessing these new methods: although use of modern methods increased by a substantial amount among women in the Couples treatment relative to a control group who received no voucher, they experienced no corresponding reduction in unwanted births. These findings indicate that asymmetric information about use of contraceptives has a strong influence on outcomes in household bargaining over fertility. Furthermore, increasing the supply of contraceptives will have little impact on excess fertility in Africa as long as de facto <b>spousal</b> <b>consent</b> requirements for birth control access remain in place...|$|E
40|$|With {{the growing}} use of {{assisted}} reproductive technology (“ART”), courts have to reconcile competing rights to seek and avoid procreation. Often, in imagining {{the boundaries of}} these rights, judges turn to abortion jurisprudence for guidance. This move sparks controversy. On the one hand, abortion case law may provide the strongest constitutional foundation for scholars and advocates seeking rights to access ART or avoid un-wanted parenthood. On the other hand, abortion jurisprudence carries normative and political baggage: a privacy framework that disadvantages poor women {{and a history of}} intense polarization. This article uses the legal history of struggle over <b>spousal</b> <b>consent</b> abortion restrictions as a new way into the debate about the relationship between ART and existing reproductive rights. Such laws would require women to notify or obtain consent from their husbands before a doctor can perform an abortion. Scholars use spousal-consultation laws to illustrate the sex stereotypes supposedly underlying all abortion restrictions. This article tells a far more complex story. When feminists and pro-lifers battled about <b>spousal</b> <b>consent</b> in the 1970 s, they wrestled with many of the questions motivating current battles about ART: Do women enjoy a unique role in child-rearing and childbearing? Does gestation, caretaking, or a genetic connection explain the decision-making power conferred on women in the context of reproduction? How could feminists reconcile demands that men perform a greater share of child-rearing with arguments that women should have the final decision on reproductive matters? By reexamining the history of the consent wars, we can gain valuable perspective on what can go right—and wrong—when we forge a jurisprudence based on the relationship between genetic, gestational, and functional parenthood. The consent wars helped drive a wedge between feminist sex-equality arguments—which challenged sex stereotypes and reproductive rights law—which partly relied on similar generalizations about sex roles. Throughout the 1960 s and 1970 s, legal feminists pushed new laws on publicly funded child care and pregnancy discrimination in a quest to assign more caretaking responsibility to men and to the State. Feminists believed that separating women’s gestational and functional parenthood would help root out damaging sex stereotypes and dramatically expand women’s role in the political, economic, and social spheres. The consent wars flipped this project on its head: for both strategic and ideological reasons, feminists assumed a more traditional vision of the roles, rights, and responsibilities of both mothers and fathers. Feminists argued that women had a unique role not only in the context of gestation but also in the context of child-rearing. While these contentions strengthened the constitutional case against <b>spousal</b> <b>consent</b> laws, they were unnecessary. Without contradicting their support for equal parenting responsibilities, feminists could have stressed that the law did not treat the fetus as a child. Consequently, a man’s interest in equal parenting might have looked quite different before, rather than after, viability. Moreover, conflating gestational and functional parenthood had damaging, unintended consequences, entrenching sex stereotypes about gender roles at the heart of abortion jurisprudence. In chronicling the consent wars, we can gain a better under-standing of the proper relationship between ART and the existing constitutional framework governing reproduction. As feminists recognized in the 1960 s and 1970 s, pregnancy—not the burdens of caretaking or genetic parenthood—puts women in a unique biological and social position. In the 1970 s, by reading a broader understanding of women’s disproportionate share of parenting into Roe v. Wade, feminists inadvertently created an opening for courts to fall back on deeply rooted stereotypes about women’s role in the home. To avoid this trap in ART cases, we should read abortion jurisprudence as standing for the connection between sex equality and women’s gestational role. The consent wars powerfully demonstrate the costs feminists can face when they fail to unbundle women’s genetic, gestational, and functional parenthood. Conversely, ART jurisprudence spotlights the path not taken by feminists during the consent wars. Separating the strands of parental rights allows us to define women’s equal citizenship concerns in abortion with greater precision. Because only women can carry pregnancies to term, abortion bans necessarily implicate women’s interest in equal treatment, regardless of who takes on caretaking responsibilities after childbirth. Equally important, the injuries associated with unwanted pregnancy itself—to bodily integrity, dignity, and autonomy—can justify a woman’s right to abortion regardless of who assumes caretaking responsibilities later in life...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{addresses}} a discrete but inequitable {{issue in the}} area of name-change law. As the law currently operates in Massachusetts, the process by which a married person, usually a woman, can seek a legal name change requires signed permission—the written assent of a spouse. In the absence of such signed permission or <b>spousal</b> <b>consent,</b> a married person seeking a name change is required to serve his or her spouse by certified mail, as an adversary, in what is otherwise typically a nonadversarial administrative legal process. This requirement of spousal notification and consent, although gender neutral on its face, has a disparate impact on married women seeking to change their names, including those seeking to resume their birth names. Although the legalization of same-sex marriage has somewhat altered these dynamics, many individuals in same-sex relationships also change their names upon marriage and therefore the impact of the spousal-consent requirement applies with equal force in any marital relationship. Whether due to marriage, change in marital status, or some other significant life event, {{there is no question that}} many people, particularly women, face the issue of whether to change their name. The law that addresses this most personal and private, yet also very public, issue of name-change regulation includes vestiges of patriarchy that place an undue burden on women, particularly those who marry. This Article will discuss why this spousal-consent requirement is a problem and suggests simple changes to cure at least this one flagrant disparity. Additionally, because this “requirement” is not referenced in the controlling statutory law, it seems to fall into the category of what Elizabeth F. Emens refers to as “desk-clerk law” in her seminal article Changing Name Changing: Framing Rules and the Future of Marital Names. Therefore, it seems that this problem can be corrected by a legislative, administrative, or judicial initiative to correct the forms as well as the required process for legal name change in Massachusetts...|$|E

The authors have analyzed difference of parental consent to commit a transaction by their minor child from the consent of a spouse to commit a transaction by another spouse concerning the joint property.

The concept ?valuable marital property?, which includes also money, is studied; and it is offered to consider agreements to acquire things having significant value as transactions on valuable marital property. The authors have grounded the conclusion that small household transaction committed by one of the spouses without the consent of another one, can also be contested in a court. To determine the legal consequences of an agreement on joint property disposal must establish ?the fact of disagreement? of one of the spouses on concluding the agreement by another spouse, and not ?the fact of presence or absence? of such a consent; notarized consent of another spouse is required for agreements of free property disposal, etc. ??????????? ??????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ?????? ?? ???????? ?? ?????????? ?????? ? ????????? ?????? ????????? ?????? ????????. ??????????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ???????? ? ?????? ????? ?????????. ???? ??????????? ?? ?????????????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????? ????????????????...|$|E
40|$|Background: Reproductive {{health and}} Family Planning (FP) {{services}} {{have been of}} global concern especially in developing countries where fertility rates are high. Traditionally FP services had always targeted females {{with little or no}} attention given to males. To ensure equitable distribution of health services, Ministry of Health (MOH), Ghana adopted the Community-Based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) as a nationwide health policy with the aim of reducing obstacles to physical and geographical access to health care delivery including FP services. However, not much is known {{about the extent to which}} this policy has contributed to male involvement in FP services. This qualitative descriptive study was therefore designed to explore male involvement in FP services in communities with well functioning CHPS and those with less or no functioning CHPS structures. The study further solicited views of the community on the health status of children. Methods: This was a qualitative descriptive study and adapted the design of an ongoing study to assess the impact of male involvement in FP referred to as the Navrongo experiment in Northern Ghana. Twelve focus group discussions were held with both male and female community members, six in communities with functional CHPS and six for communities with less/no-functional CHPS. In addition, fifty- nine (59) in-depth interviews were held with Community Health Officers (CHOs), Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) and Health Managers at both the districts and regional levels. The interviews and discussions were tape recorded digitally, transcribed and entered into QSR Nvivo 10 © for analysis. Results: The results revealed a general high perception of an improved health status of children in the last ten years in the communities. These improvements were attributed to immunization of children, exclusive breastfeeding, health education given to mothers on childcare, growth monitoring of children and accessible health care. Despite these achievements in the health of children, participants reported that malnutrition was still rife in the community. The results also revealed that spousal approval was still relevant for women in the use of contraceptives; however, the matrilineal system appears to give more autonomy to women in decision-making. The CHPS strategy was perceived as very helpful with full community participation at all levels of the implementation process. Males were more involved in FP services in communities with functioning CHPS than those without functioning CHPS. Conclusion: The CHPS strategy has increased access to FP services but <b>spousal</b> <b>consent</b> was very important in the use of FP services. Involving males in reproductive health issues including FP is important to attain reproductive health targets...|$|E

The work examines {{the status of a}} third party in the understanding of the Land Registry Law, what existing laws and regulations of the Republic of Latvia protect the rights of third parties and how they are applied in practice, and analyzes problems associated with the protection of third party rights. The aim of the master’s thesis is to find the main causes and reasons why third party rights are breached in the Republic of Latvia, and how to facilitate simpler and more secure observation of third party rights in corroborating rights in land registries. The observation of third party rights is monitored by judges of the land registry departments of district courts by examining submitted corroboration requests and the documents enclosed with them. Because when a request is satisfied the corroboration decision reflects only the basic document (obligation) under which the new right has been corroborated, it does not show the judge’s assessment; whether potential violation of third party rights has been taken into consideration; whether the documents contained consent of third parties, when such was required by law. The problems can be seen when working in a land registry department, but to a wider public they are noticeable only in appealed decisions, and with very rare exceptions, only unnoticed decisions of land registry judges are ever appealed. The apparent problems are connected with two aspects: the desire of persons to circumvent third party rights, and the interpretation and application of laws in the taking of decisions. The research looks at ways of better protecting third party rights and proposes solutions for addressing these issues.

40|$|The study {{sought to}} determine, first, what {{the rules of the}} Hananwa family law were and, second, whether those rules were {{compatible}} with the Constitution. First, it documented the rules of the official family law. The problem that the study countenanced is that customary law is "corrupted, inauthentic and lacking authority". 1 Second, it established and documented the rules of the Hananwa family law. The problem that the study countenanced in respect of Hananwa law was that it was difficult to ascertain the content of the rules of the "living" Hananwa law in order to determine their compatibility with the provisions of the Bill of Rights. Moreover, the traditional Hananwa community is inegalitarian and patriarchal. Section 9 of the Constitution provides that everyone is equal before the law and enjoys equal and full protection and benefit of the law. The study found that the Hananwas still observe their system of customary law. However, there are visible changes. For instance, nowadays the <b>spousal</b> <b>consent</b> is a validity requirement for all customary marriages. A parent or legal guardian must consent to a customary marriage of a minor. The individual spouses, not their families, are parties to their own customary marriages. African women enjoy equal status. This development is consistent with section 9 of the Constitution read with section 6 of the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act 120 of 1998. According to the Constitutional Court, in MM v MN and Another 2013 4 SA 415 (CC), the first wife must consent to her husband's customary marriage to another woman in addition to her customary marriage to him. However, some rules of the Hananwa law do not comply with the provisions of the Bill of Rights. For instance, according to the Hananwa law, extramarital children do not enjoy equal inheritance rights and maintenance rights yet. This discrimination is inconsistent with the constitutional right to equality and the provisions of the Reform of Customary Laws of Succession and Regulations of Related Matters Act 11 of 2009. The Constitution puts common law and customary law on a par. However, the courts have often replaced customary law dispute resolution rules with the common law rules. For instance, the Constitutional Court in Bhe and Others v Magistrate, Khayelitsha and Others; Shibi v Sithole and South African Human Rights Commission and Another v President of the Republic of South Africa and Another 2005 1 SA 580 (CC) and the High Court in Maluleke v Minister of Home Affairs 2008 JDR 0426 (W) substituted the rules of common law for those of customary law in order to resolve customary law disputes. The legislature could not be outdone. A meticulous study of the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act 120 of 1998 and the Reform of Customary Laws of Succession and Regulations of Related Matters Act 11 of 2009 reveals that their provisions almost appropriately reflect the common law marriage and intestate succession rules respectively. The Recognition of Customary Marriages Act has, furthermore, adopted the provisions of the Divorce Act of 1979. Section 28 of the Constitution read with the Children's Act 38 of 2005 has generally substituted the fundamental human rights for the unequal rights provided by the customary law of parent and child.

Guarda dos filhos, estado civil, necessidade de vênia para alienação de bens, meação, direito real de habitação ao sobrevivente e efeitos sucessórios são apenas alguns dos tantos itens nos quais ou há lacuna do ordenamento ou a lei existe, mas trata as realidades sociais de modo absolutamente díspares. Isso em detrimento da família no aspecto mais amplo da palavra e ofendendo a dignidade da pessoa humana dos conviventes da união estável, dos filhos destas lídimas uniões e dos demais atores sociais envolvidos, violando frontalmente a Constituição Federal. A presente tese aborda o histórico pátrio da união estável, traz um estudo comparativo com países ocidentais e demonstra as divergências existentes hoje na regulamentação dessas espécies de família. Após demonstrar robustos fundamentos acerca da necessidade de sistematização legislativa, a tese concluí pela proposta de uma ampla reforma no ordenamento, que alteraria a proteção conferida aos conviventes da união estável, visando sistematizá-la de modo digno. The normatization {{of the family}} deserves absolutely preferential treatment in the social organization. The first bond in a society is the familiar one and the relations that are created in this environment generate social, legal and patrimonial consequences that deserve close attention of the Legislative. At {{the beginning of the}} third millennium, the mere constitutional forecast that defines the domestic partnership as a familiar entity is not enough. Its now required an ample chain of legal protection. The ways in which a family can be created are varied, but it is easily verifiable that the marriage and the domestic partnership gain priority in absolute numbers in the occidental society. In the two cases, {{a man and a woman}} join themselves with the clear objective to constitute a family, with all the consequences and effects that the word carries. From this moment on a myriad of chances for litigations and controversies appear between the pairs, which is also verifiable at the assistance counters of the Court Houses and at the domiciles in the whole country. Child custody disputes, civil status, necessity of <b>spousal</b> <b>consent</b> for property alienation, elective share, joint tenancy with right of survivorship and successor rights effects are only some of the many items in which there are gaps in the legal system or the law exists, but it deals with the social realities in an absolutely incongruent way. This in detriment of the family in the amplest aspect of the word and offending the dignity of the human being of the parties in the domestic partnership, of the children of these legitimate unions and of all other involved social actor, violating the Federal Constitution. The present thesis approaches the native history of the domestic partnership, brings a comparative study of occidental countries and demonstrates the actual existing divergences in the regulation of these kinds of family. After demonstrating strong reasons in reference to the need of the legislative systematization, the thesis concludes with the proposal of a wide reformation in the legal system that would modify the protection conferred to the parties in the domestic partnership, aiming to systemize it in a dignified manner...|$|E
