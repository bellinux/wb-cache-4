5|$|Ramírez played {{independent}} {{league baseball}} {{for the next}} two seasons. After receiving an invitation to try out for the Pensacola Pelicans of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball, the Pelicans signed Ramirez for the 2005 season. In 43 games with Pensacola, Ramírez pitched to a 1.45 earned run average (ERA), struck out 93 batters and walked only 15. He finished the season with a record of 2–2 with 11 saves over 62 innings pitched. In September 2005, the Angels purchased Ramírez from the Pelicans. He pitched in one game for their Class AAA affiliate, the Salt Lake <b>Stingers</b> of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). The Angels released Ramírez in spring training in 2006. Ramírez was not provided with a reason for his release.|$|E
5|$|Sierra composers Mark Seibert and Jay User {{created the}} musical score for Phantasmagoria, with Neal Grandstaf {{providing}} additional music. Most {{of the music}} {{is a mixture of}} real instruments with synthesized and sampled sounds, and unlike previous Sierra games, the score was recorded live, rather than created in the computer. Themes for the music ranged from rock and roll to opera. The composers observed the game and various scenes to prepare their score, trying to create an ambiance and identify spots to build the tension with music, creating <b>stingers</b> as needed. For cinematic scenes, they watched tapes after the scenes were shot and composed the music afterward. This was a new process for Sierra and the computer game industry in general, but the same concept was regularly followed in the film industry.|$|E
50|$|LJN did {{produce a}} few variant figures {{including}} the young Tygra version {{and the silver}} rat-eye daggers for Rataro. There are also a few slight color variations of Lion-O, such as red and orange-haired versions. The third series of figures from 1987 are harder to find along with the Tongue-A-Saurus and Astral Moat Monster. Driller and Stinger are the toughest figures to track down; <b>Stinger's</b> wings are very fragile, making it next to impossible to find a loose, complete figure.|$|R

50|$|ASRAD Hellas is an {{advanced}} short-range air defence system developed by Rheinmetall. The Greek army has acquired 54 vehicle-mounted <b>STINGER</b> ASRAD Hellas (German design). The ASRAD Hellas is configured to enable reliable target detection, identification, and engagement during {{day or night}} under all possible conditions of visibility and weather. Due to its modularity and flexibility, the ASRAD Hellas fire unit embodies significant growth potential, permitting it to operate with passive and active surveillance sensors such as infrared search, track devices, and external 2D or 3D surveillance radars. The system is operated by a two-man team, composed of a weapons operator and a driver.|$|R
5|$|Prionomyrmecini is an ant tribe {{belonging}} to the subfamily Myrmeciinae established by William Morton Wheeler in 1915. Two members {{are a part of}} this tribe, the extant Nothomyrmecia and the extinct Prionomyrmex. The tribe was once considered a subfamily due to the similarities between Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex, but such reclassification was not widely accepted by the scientific community. These ants can be identified by their long slender bodies, powerful <b>stingers</b> and elongated mandibles. Fossil Prionomyrmecini ants were once found throughout Europe, possibly nesting in trees and preferring jungle habitats. Today, Prionomyrmecini is only found in Australia, preferring old-growth mallee woodland surrounded by Eucalyptus trees. Nothomyrmecia workers feed on nectar and arthropods, using their compound eyes for prey and navigational purposes. Owing to their primitive nature, they do not recruit others to food sources or create pheromone trails. Nothomyrmecia colonies are small, consisting of 50 to 100 individuals.|$|E
5|$|The Australian magpie is omnivorous, eating various items {{located at}} or near ground level {{including}} invertebrates such as earthworms, millipedes, snails, spiders and scorpions {{as well as a}} wide variety of insects—cockroaches, ants, beetles, moths and caterpillars and other larvae. Insects, including large adult grasshoppers, may be seized mid-flight. Skinks, frogs, mice and other small animals as well as grain, tubers, figs and walnuts have also been noted as components of their diet. It has even learnt to safely eat the poisonous cane toad by flipping it over and consuming the underparts. Predominantly a ground feeder, the Australian magpie paces open areas methodically searching for insects and their larvae. One study showed birds were able to find scarab beetle larvae by sound or vibration. Birds use their bills to probe into the earth or otherwise overturn debris in search of food. Smaller prey are swallowed whole, although magpies rub off the <b>stingers</b> of bees and wasps before swallowing.|$|E
5|$|The green-head ant is a diurnal {{species that}} is active {{throughout}} the day, quickly foraging {{on either the}} ground or vegetation. They are scavengers, predators and seed-eaters, generally having a broad diet of animal material, insects, small arthropods, honeydew from sap-sucking insects and seeds. The workers usually prey on beetles, moths and termites, using their <b>stingers</b> to kill them by injecting venom. The removal of the capitula (structure similar to an elaiosome) from Eurycnema goliath eggs reduces the chances of them being collected by green-head ants that carry them back into their nests. In areas where the meat ant (Iridomyrmex purpureus) is dominant, the green-head ant is not affected by its presence and is still successful in finding food sources. As green-head ants are primitive general predators, {{in contrast to the}} more advanced species (which forage in groups and always communicate via trail pheromones), they are unable to defend food sources from dominant ants. They rely heavily on any food source, and the impossibility of successfully defending it from other ants may have led to their peaceful coexistence with dominant species, including meat ants.|$|E
50|$|The Kia Stinger traces {{its roots}} to the Kia GT Concept from the 2011 Frankfurt Auto Show and the Kia GT4 Stinger from the 2014 North American International Auto Show. Designed by Peter Schreyer and Gregory Guillaume at Kia's European studio and {{engineered}} by former BMW M Vice President of Engineering Albert Biermann, {{the car was}} unveiled at the 2017 North American International Auto Show. According to Guillaume, the <b>Stinger's</b> design was partially inspired by the Coca-Cola bottle. Testing of the car involved over 1,000 kilometers at the Korea International Circuit and 10,000 kilometers at the Nürburgring Nordschleife.|$|R
5000|$|A final upgrade {{adapted the}} greatly {{improved}} seeker from the FIM-92 Stinger to the MIM-72, starting in 1980. The <b>Stinger's</b> seeker is considerably more capable {{in terms of}} off-axis [...] "sighting," [...] {{as well as being}} able to reject most common forms of jamming. Ford was contracted to deliver the resulting MIM-72G starting in 1982, and all existing missiles had been updated by the late 1980s. New-build G models followed between 1990 and 1991. By this point in time the system was already being removed from regular Army service, and being handed over to the National Guard.|$|R
50|$|The worker bee's stinger is {{a complex}} organ that allows a bee to defend itself and the hive from most mammals. Attacking bees aim for the face by sensing regions {{with high levels of}} carbon dioxide (like mosquitos). Bee stings against mammals and birds {{typically}} leave the stinger embedded in the victim due to the structure of flesh and the <b>stinger's</b> barbs. In this case, the venom bulb stays with the stinger and continues to pump. Upon losing its stinger, the bee will subsequently die since the portion where the stinger bulb was removed rips out part of its insides.|$|R
5|$|This ray can be {{identified}} by its dark dorsal surface covered in white spots or rings. Near {{the base of the}} ray's relatively long tail, just behind the pelvic fins, are several venomous, barbed <b>stingers.</b> Spotted eagle rays commonly feed on small fish and crustaceans, and will sometimes dig with their snouts to look for food buried in the sand of the sea bed. These rays are commonly observed leaping out of the water, and on at least two occasions have been reported as having jumped into boats, in one incident resulting in the death of a woman in the Florida Keys. The spotted eagle ray is hunted by a wide variety of sharks. The rays are considered near threatened on the IUCN Red List. They are fished mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa, the most common market being in commercial trade and aquariums. They are protected in the Great Barrier Reef.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} ants that use scent to forage for food, jack jumpers use their sight to target their prey. Like other bull ants, they are solitary when they forage, but only workers perform this role. These ants are omnivores and scavengers, {{typically}} foraging in warmer temperatures. They deliver painful stings, which {{are effective in}} both killing prey and deterring predators. Jack jumpers have smooth <b>stingers,</b> and can thus sting indefinitely. Jack jumper ants are skilled hunters, partially due to their excellent vision; they can even kill and devour wasps and bees. They also kill and eat other ants, such as carpenter ants (Camponotus) and feed on sweet floral secretions and other sugar solutions. Jack jumpers often hunt for spiders, and will sometimes follow their prey for a short distance, usually with small insects and small arthropods. Jack jumper ants, alongside M. simillima, have been given frozen houseflies (Musca domestica) and blowflies (Calliphoridae) as food under testing conditions. The ant has been observed to run and leap energetically at flies when they land, particularly on Acacia shrubs, plants or trees. Jack jumpers and other Myrmecia ants prey on insects such as cockroaches and crickets.|$|E

50|$|For {{integrated}} system operations during {{national and international}} missions, the ASRAD Hellas can be equipped with additional C3I interface software for network-enabled operations and links to upper echelon allied operation centers.The system can be deployed in either stationary or mobile mode. Limitations of the <b>STINGER</b> missile with respect to pitch and roll acceleration on the move {{have had to be}} taken into account. During stationary operation the control and display unit (CDU) can be separated from the vehicle and connected to the system by a cable for remote operation. The maximum distance for remote control is 100 metres. Germany and Finland use similar systems.|$|R
50|$|Flashbacks to Donnie and Duke's {{childhood}} in Texas run concurrent {{to the main}} murder plot. They both grow up in <b>Stinger's</b> Creek and are inseparable. Duke {{is very close to}} his kindly Uncle Bill but has to deal with a lot of hardship in his life {{in the form of a}} drug addicted, promiscuous mother and the unwanted attentions of a paedophile. Donnie also has domestic strife as his father is a negligent alcoholic, while Duke's negative surroundings are moulding him into a deeply disturbed boy with a penchant for violence. At the age of fifteen the two boys make a chilling blood pact to remain loyal to one another until the end, a precursor to their later dastardly actions.|$|R
50|$|The Alliance of Evil {{was once}} Apocalypse's {{personal}} strike force, {{and carried out}} his bidding. Their first mission was to find and capture Michael Nowlan, a mutant {{with the ability to}} heighten other mutants' powers. When Nowlan tried to leave, they kidnapped his girlfriend, Suzy, to use as bait. X-Factor found Nowlan and vowed to protect him. When the Alliance traced him down, they threatened Suzy to make him power them up. The Alliance fought and defeated X-Factor, bringing Nowlan back to their master. X-Factor eventually found their hideout, and on Apocalypse's orders Nowlan powered up the Alliance again. When Suzy tried to escape, <b>Stinger's</b> bolts accidentally kill her. Nowlan killed himself, and Apocalypse abandoned the Alliance of Evil and escaped.|$|R
