Willdenow published both A.cuneata and A.crenata, giving them different descriptions but designating the <b>same</b> <b>type</b> specimen for both. Thus A.crenata was rejected under {{the principle of}} priority, and is now regarded as a nomenclatural synonym of A.cuneatus.|$|E
5|$|Another viable use {{of custom}} allocators is for {{debugging}} memory-related errors.

5|$|The hemmema's {{design was}} {{very similar to that}} of the turuma. The primary {{difference}} was that the turuma's oarsmen sat on the weather deck above the guns, whereas the hemmema's oarsmen sat on the gundeck.

Glete has described them as variations on the <b>same</b> <b>type,</b> especially when considering the pre-war designs.|$|E

5|$|A {{country that}} had been {{reported}} to be a likely early export customer for the modernized Su-35 was Venezuela. The Venezuelan government of Hugo Chavez in July 2006 placed an order for 24 Su-30MK2s to replace its fleet of F-16s that were subjected to a US arms embargo. The aircraft were delivered to the Venezuelan Air Force from 2006 to 2008. The country was expected to follow up with a second order for the <b>same</b> <b>type,</b> or make a purchase of the Su-35. Despite subsequent reports that the Venezuelan government were interested in the aircraft and had placed an order for the Su-35, the country was negotiating with Russia in 2016 for the Su-30 aircraft instead.|$|E

5|$|Halo Wars is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) {{video game}} developed {{exclusively for the}} Xbox 360 console, in which players command armies from a bird's-eye view of the battlefield. The game focuses on military combat, but contains streamlined resource management and base construction elements. It was designed with the Xbox 360 controller in mind; for example, the A button is used for selecting units. A single tap of the button selects one unit, while a double tap selects all units of the <b>same</b> <b>type.</b> The d-pad navigates to current battles and cycles through bases, while the right analog stick adjusts the camera angle. A radial menu is used for base construction.|$|E
5|$|If two {{cells of}} the <b>same</b> <b>type</b> meet in this phase, they cross-fertilise to a diploid zygote through the fusion of protoplasms and nuclei.

If the resulting cells were peritrichous, they change their shape before the fusion from the peritrichous form to the myxamoeba. For {{the production of a}} zygote, cells of different mating types (heterothallic) are required.|$|E

A 44.9-foot-long {{bridge of the}} <b>same</b> <b>type</b> {{was built in the}} same year and carries Wells Street over the creek. A 43.0-foot-long bridge of a similar type was built in 2009 and carries T-422/Burcher Ave over the creek.

5|$|Junior synonym: A name which {{describes}} the same taxon as a previously published name. If {{two or more}} genera are formally designated and the type specimens are later assigned to the same genus, {{the first to be}} published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN (see Tyrannosaurus), but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the <b>same</b> <b>type</b> specimen.|$|E
5|$|Metallic bonding can be {{classified}} {{as a type of}} covalent bonding for which the constituent atoms of the <b>same</b> <b>type</b> and do not combine with one another to form a chemical bond. Atoms will lose an electron(s) forming an array of positive ions. These electrons are shared by the lattice which makes the electron cluster mobile, as the electrons are free to move as well as the ions. For this, it gives metals their relatively high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as being characteristically ductile.|$|E
