5|$|Analyzing deep-infrared images {{obtained}} by the <b>Spitzer</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> and Gemini North telescope, astronomers discovered {{that one of the}} cluster's stars – HD 23514, which has a mass and luminosity a bit greater than that of the Sun, is surrounded by an extraordinary number of hot dust particles. This could be evidence for planet formation around HD 23514.|$|E
5|$|Having {{discovered}} the planet, the astronomers worked {{to discover a}} transit event using the Infrared Array Camera of the <b>Spitzer</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope,</b> as ground-based observations could prove difficult if Gliese 3634 b was a rocky planet. While the observations did not suggest that Gliese 3634 b transited its star, a few orbital parameters were discovered, yielding the planet's true mass, which cannot be collected solely by radial velocity measurements.|$|E
5|$|The James Webb Space Telescope {{will have}} 18 {{hexagonal}} beryllium sections for its mirrors. Because JWST {{will face a}} temperature of 33 K, the mirror is made of gold-plated beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass.

For the same reason, the optics of the <b>Spitzer</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> are entirely built of beryllium metal.|$|E

5|$|Further {{concepts}} {{for advanced}} 21st-century space telescopes include the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope, a conceptualized 8- to 16-meter (320- to 640-inch) optical space telescope that if realized {{could be a}} more direct successor to HST, {{with the ability to}} observe and photograph astronomical objects in the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with substantially better resolution than Hubble or the <b>Spitzer</b> <b>Space</b> <b>telescope.</b> This effort is being planned for the 2025–2035 time frame.|$|E

No dangerous levels of radiation made it through the Earth's magnetosphere, therefore no damage was done to any surface-bound electronics or communications.

5|$|On March 22, 2005, NASA {{released}} {{news that}} infrared {{light from the}} planet had been measured by the <b>Spitzer</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope,</b> the first ever direct detection of light from an extrasolar planet. This was done by subtracting the parent star's constant light and noting the difference as the planet transited {{in front of the}} star and was eclipsed behind it, providing a measure of the light from the planet itself. New measurements from this observation determined the planet's temperature as at least 750°C (1300°F). The circular orbit of HD 209458 b was also confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a space {{telescope}} that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation.

The Spitzer Science Center (SSC) and IRSA are collaborating to design and deploy the Spitzer Heritage Archive (SHA), which will supersede the current Spitzer archive.

The research team used Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 to measure the distance to GN-z11 spectroscopically, by splitting the light into its component colors to measure the redshift caused by {{the expansion of the}} universe. The findings, which were announced in March 2016, revealed the galaxy to be farther away than originally thought, at the distance limit of what the Hubble Telescope can observe. GN-z11 is around 150 million years older than the previous record-holder EGSY8p7, and is observed (shortly after but) [...] "very close {{to the end of the}} so-called Dark Ages of the universe", and (during but) [...] "near the very beginning" [...] of the reionization era.|$|R
5|$|Very-high {{redshift}} objects (Lyman-break galaxies) {{cannot be}} seen in visible light and generally are detected in infrared or submillimetre wavelength surveys of the HDF instead. Observations with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) indicated infrared emission from 13 galaxies visible in the optical images, attributed to large quantities of dust associated with intense star formation. Infrared observations have also been made with the <b>Spitzer</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope.</b> Submillimeter observations of the field have been made with SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, initially detecting 5 sources, although with very low resolution. Observations have also been made with the Subaru telescope in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the <b>Spitzer</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> had {{produced}} high-resolution infrared {{images of the}} dust around Vega. It was shown to extend out to 43″ (330AU) at a wavelength of 24μm, 70″ (543AU) at 70μm and 105″ (815AU) at 160μm. These much wider disks {{were found to be}} circular and free of clumps, with dust particles ranging from 1–50μm in size. The estimated total mass of this dust is 3 times the mass of the Earth. Production of the dust would require collisions between asteroids in a population corresponding to the Kuiper Belt around the Sun. Thus the dust is more likely created by a debris disk around Vega, rather than from a protoplanetary disk as was earlier thought.|$|E
5|$|Early {{spectral}} {{classification of}} the nuclei of the LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers {{indicated that the}} properties of LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers cannot be distinguished from the overall population of LIRGs. Roughly one third of megamaser hosts are classified as starburst galaxies, one quarter are classified as Seyfert 2 galaxies, and the remainder are classified as low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions, or LINERs. The optical properties of hydroxyl megamaser hosts and non-hosts are not significantly different. Recent infrared observations using the <b>Spitzer</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> are, however, able to distinguish hydroxyl megamaser hosts galaxies from non-masing LIRGs, as 10–25% of hydroxyl megamaser hosts show evidence for an active galactic nucleus, compared to 50–95% for non-masing LIRGs.|$|E

Deep JWST continuum spectroscopy of these quasars will establish the epoch and history of the Universe through detection of the Gunn-Peterson trough and/or Lyman-alpha damping wings. The statistics and luminosity function of high-z quasars will reveal the early history of accretion in the most extreme systems, providing insights in the role of black holes in galaxy evolution.

Kepler-10c was the third transiting planet to be confirmed statistically (based on probability rather than actual observation), after Kepler-9d and Kepler-11g.
