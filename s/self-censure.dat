40|$|It can be {{difficult}} for researchers from outside the military {{to gain access to}} the field. However, there is a rich source on the military that is readily available for every researcher: military memoirs. This source does provide some methodological challenges with regard to truth and (self) censorship, nevertheless. This study questions how truth and (self) censorship issues influence the content of these military autobiographies. It shows that these issues are not only a concern for researchers, but also for military writers themselves. The study provides concrete quantitative data based on military Afghanistan memoirs published between 2001 and 2010 from five different countries: the UK, the US, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. The majority of soldier-authors make some kind of truth claim in their books that they also substantiate. Military books published by traditional publishers do so significantly more often than self-published books. In books published in Anglo-Saxon countries soldier-authors make truth claims five times more often than do military authors from the Netherlands and Germany. At the same time, military authors also frequently admit to some form of <b>self-censuring,</b> so truth claims and self-censorship go hand in hand. From each of the countries studied, at least one author mentions being actively censored by the military, but most do not even mention it, making censorship a common, almost normal military feature. Making truth claims, mentioning being censored, or self-censoring do not influence the kind of plots these authors write either in a negative, or positive way.

50|$|Another {{method of}} {{disengagement}} is through disregard or misrepresentation {{of the consequences}} of action. When someone decides to pursue an activity harmful to others for personal advantage, or as a result of impact by social stimulus, they generally either minimize the harm they have caused or attempt to avoid facing it. People would willingly begin to recollect prior information regarding the potential benefits of the behavior but are less likely to recall its harmful effects the behavior would cause to others. People are especially inclined to the minimize harmful effects when they act alone.

Apart from selective inattention and subjectively cognitive distortion of effects, the misrepresentation of consequences may also involve persistent efforts to eliminate evidence of the damage they cause to others. Therefore, there is little reason for <b>self-censure</b> or moral codes to be triggered as long as the harm is overlooked, minimized or distorted.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{relatively}} easy to hurt others when the detrimental results of one's conduct are ignored, and when causal effects are not visible because they are remote from one's behaviour on the physical and mental level. Mechanized weapon systems and explosive devices that can lead to severe casualty but is controlled by someone at a distance pressing one button are suited examples elucidating such depersonalized action. Even there exists a high level personal responsibility in people, they will still execute detrimental behaviours when the harm they inflict on their victims are not realized. Individuals try to cut off the connections between harmful activities and self-sanctions by distorting the consequences associated with a given act. For instance, [...] "use of this mechanism in sport is seen when players avoid finding out the extent of injuries sustained by opponents or deny the seriousness of the injuries of which they are aware". On the contrary, when people are aware of the suffering they cause, indirectly awakened distress and <b>self-censure</b> start to function and serve as self-restraining influences. For example, people are less likely to obey to execute detrimental behaviours as the victim's pain became more evident and personalized.|$|E
40|$|The {{overarching}} aim of {{this thesis}} was {{to contribute to the}} understanding of specific moral-cognitive processes and mechanisms and their association with aggressive behaviour across age groups and across two cultures. A review of the literature identified the key questions for present research. There is extensive evidence that the normative acceptability of aggression is associated with aggressive behaviour. However the acceptability for retaliation in specific situations and discernment between justified and unjustified retaliation has not been thoroughly researched. Secondly the role of <b>self-censure</b> and self-reflection 'in the regulation of aggressive behaviour needs to be examined further. Finally hostility between groups and its association with beliefs has not been investigated in Muslim samples. Eight empirical studies addressed these specific questions. Study one investigated the component structure of Normative Beliefs about aggression Scale using samples from Pakistan and the UK. Beliefs about equal retaliation, excessive retaliation and beliefs about general aggression were found to be distinct components, were endorsed differentially and had different level of association with aggressive behaviour across both countries. Study two established the discriminant validity of this distinction by comparing a group of violent adolescents with a matched group of non-violent adolescents on acceptability of these types of retaliation. Study 3 examined the association of <b>self-censure</b> with aggressive behaviour and normative beliefs about aggression and retaliation. <b>Self-censure</b> was negatively associated with aggressive behaviour as well as with beliefs indicating that higher the endorsement of aggression, lower would be the expected <b>self-censure</b> as a result of aggression. Study four using retrospective accounts of real aggressive episodes found that private self-consciousness predicted <b>self-censure</b> as well as thinking about one's own aggressive actions. Both thinking and <b>self-censure</b> were negatively associated with frequency of aggressive acts. The beliefs about direct and indirect aggression among Pakistani adolescents were tested in Study five and a reliable measure was developed and found to have convergent validity. Study six examined moral reasoning among children and explored at a preliminary level a possible intervention for changing beliefs about victimization in school. Study seven and eight extended investigation of beliefs to intergroup context (anti-Semitic beliefs) and found that extreme beliefs were related to hostile intentions. An educational intervention was carried out which showed that beliefs could be influenced through creating empathy and stressing intergroup similarity.

40|$|Despite an {{abundance}} of research demonstrating the importance of apologies in restoring damaged relationships, relatively {{little is known about}} the offender perspective after apologizing. Recent research on apology suggests that for offenders, apologizing may be an aversive experience, and refusing to apologize can provide psychological benefits (i. e., power, control, self-worth). In contrast, the present research seeks to explore why individuals do apologize after harming co-workers. Using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, four apology motives were identified: (1) <b>Self-Censure,</b> (2) Relational Concerns, (3) Expedience, and (4) Fear of Sanctions. Then, we drew on Motivated Action Theory to examine the relationship between apology motives and offender perceptions in the reconciliation process. Results indicate that apology motives influenced offender perceptions of victim forgiveness and relational reconciliation. Those who apologized to preserve valued relationships, to correct the wrongdoing, and to resolve the conflict quickly perceived their apologies to be effective in eliciting forgiveness and reconciliation. Paradoxically, those who apologized to avoid further conflict perceived their apology to be ineffective in promoting forgiveness and reconciliation.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} role of mechanisms of moral disengagement {{in the exercise of}} moral agency. Regulatory self-sanctions can be selectively disengaged from detrimental conduct by con-verting harmful acts to moral ones through linkage to worthy purposes, obscuring personal causal agency by diffusion and displacement of responsibility, misrepresenting or disregarding the injurious effects inflicted on others, and vilifying the recipients of maltreatment by blaming and dehumanizing them. The study examined the structure and impact of moral disengagement on detrimental conduct and the psychological processes through which it exerts its effects. Path analyses reveal that moral disengagement fosters detrimental conduct by reducing prosocialness and anticipatory <b>self-censure</b> and by promoting cognitive and affective reactions conducive to aggression. The structure of the paths of influence is very similar for interpersonal aggression and delinquent conduct. Although the various mechanisms of moral disengagement operate in concert, moral reconstruals of harmful conduct by linking it to worthy purposes and vilification of victims seem to contribute most heavily to engagement in detrimental activities. Psychological theories of moral agency focus heavily on moral thought to the neglect of moral conduct. The limited at...|$|E

Via longitudinal social network analysis (RSiena), it was tested whether similarity between friends in bullying and defending developed over time due to friends' influence, while controlling for friendship selection processes, and whether there were differences in these processes between children (age 9 - 10 years; n = 133; 42. 9 % girls) and young adolescents (age 11 - 14 years; n = 236; 40. 6 % girls). Results showed that individuals selected peers as friends who were similar in bullying and became more similar to friends in bullying over time, but only in early adolescence. Moreover, there was marginal support that friends' influence was stronger in young adolescents with higher moral disengagement. In early adolescence, bullying was also indirectly influenced through friends' moral disengagement, with different effects for boys and girls. With regard to defending, young adolescents maintained friendships with peers who were similar in defending, and became more similar to friends in terms of defending over time. These findings suggest important differences between late childhood and early adolescence in socialization processes and indicate that in early adolescence, friends' influence {{on the development of}} bullying is partially affected by moral disengagement.

40|$|Se pasa revista a todas las traducciones del Decameron (totales, parciales, adaptaciones) hechas en España entre 1800 y 1940. Las numerosas antologías estudiadas priorizan las novelle de mayor carga erótica o anticlerical, aunque a menudo ésta queda diluida por la censura o la autocensura. El balance es bastante pobre: el Decameron fue publicado en contadas ocasiones por un editor de prestigio y por un traductor capaz; la mayoría de las traducciones se hicieron desde el francés, produciéndose además numerosos plagios entre ellas; el número real de traducciones, por tanto, resulta ciertamente reducido (sólo una de las tres completas es traducción directa del italiano).

40|$|Aggressive driving {{has been}} found to result in road {{collisions}} which are a major cause of injury, fatality and financial cost in motorised countries. Qualitative and survey based studies suggest that drivers use justifications or explanations of their aggressive driving that bear strong resemblance to Bandura’s mechanisms of moral disengagement. The aim of the current study was to explore the applicability of moral disengagement to the driving context using a purpose-adapted scale, the Driving Moral Disengagement Scale. A convenience sample of general drivers (N = 294) responded to an on-line survey comprised of measures of trait anger, driving anger (DAX revised), moral disengagement and driving moral disengagement. Factor analysis allowed for reduction of the new scale from 23 items to 13 items, and this shortened Driving Moral Disengagement Scale (DMDS) had good internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha =. 83). Scree plot criteria indicated a one factor solution accounting for 34. 34 % of the variance. Bivariate correlations on the shortened DMDS revealed significant and positive relationships with measures of driving aggression, moral disengagement, trait anger and driving anger, r =. 28 –. 55. Moreover the strength of the association between driving aggression and moral disengagement was greater than that with driving anger. Hierarchical regression revealed driving moral disengagement as the strongest significant predictor of driving aggression, accounting for 18 % of the unique variation in the DV, and suggesting this may be a more useful predictor than driving anger. In addition, significant differences between participants’ mean scores for moral disengagement in everyday situations and their driving moral disengagement scores support the interpretation that drivers may behave differently from their ‘usual’ selves when driving, and that the driving context may encourage both greater moral disengagement and greater tendency towards aggressive responses. Chi square analysis indicated that those who scored high on driving moral disengagement {{were significantly more likely to}} report aggressive responses to driving situations than those with low driving moral disengagement scores (with a large effect size, φ =. 42). This suggests that the DMDS may be useful for future driving aggression research. Implications for intervention are that aiming to alert drivers to their usual <b>self-censure</b> mechanisms or to prevent the tendency to moral disengagement while driving may be effective in reducing driving aggression and the risky or dangerous responses associated with it on road...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{harassment}} {{against women}} represents aggressive behaviour {{that is often}} enacted instrumentally, {{in response to a}} threatened sense of masculinity and male identity (cf. Maass & Cadinu, 2006). To date, however, empirical and theoretical attention to the social-cognitive processes that regulate workplace harassment is scant. Drawing on Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1986), the current thesis utilises the theoretical concept of moral disengagement in order to address this important gap in the literature. According to Bandura (1990, 1999), moral standards and self-sanctions (i. e., negative emotions of guilt or shame) can be selectively deactivated through various psychosocial mechanisms. The use of these moral disengagement strategies enables a person to violate their moral principles, and perpetrate injurious behaviour without incurring <b>self-censure.</b> This thesis investigates the general hypothesis that moral disengagement facilitates and perpetuates workplace sexual harassment. A new conceptual framework is presented, elucidating the self-regulatory role of moral disengagement mechanisms in sexual harassment perpetration at work. Eight empirical studies are reported in this thesis. Studies 1 to 3 present the development and preliminary validation of the Moral Disengagement in Sexual Harassment Scale (MDiSH); a self-report measure of moral disengagement in the context of hostile work environment harassment. These studies document the excellent psychometric properties of this new scale. The MDiSH exhibited positive correlations with sexual harassment myth acceptance, male gender identification, and hostile sexism. In Study 3, participants were exposed to a fictitious case of hostile work environment harassment. The MDiSH attenuated moral judgment, negative emotions (guilt, shame, and anger), sympathy, and endorsement of prosocial behavioural intentions (support for restitution) associated with the harassment case. Conversely, the MDiSH increased positive affect (happiness) about the harassment, endorsement of avoidant behavioural intentions, and attribution of blame to the female complainant. Using the amalgamated samples of Studies 1 and 2, the MDiSH was winnowed down to create a short form of the scale (MDiSH-S). The analyses reported in Chapter 3 attest to the strong psychometric properties of this measure. Study 4 explores the influence of social identification on the relationship between moral disengagement and judgments of hostile work environment harassment. U. S. participants were presented with a harassment case in which the perpetrators were described as being either in-group or out-group members. Moral disengagement (as measured using the MDiSH) neutralised judgments of the harassing behaviour. However, participants were not more inclined to justify and positively re-appraise harassment that was committed by in-group perpetrators. Study 5 reveals that moral disengagement leads people to make more favourable judgments about the perpetrators of hostile work environment harassment. The neutralising effects of moral disengagement on judgments of the harassing conduct were partially mediated by a positive evaluation of the harassers (but not social identification with them). The final three studies (Studies 6, 7, and 8) investigate the role of moral disengagement in accounting for men’s self-reported proclivity to commit quid pro quo harassment and hostile work environment harassment. These studies examine the causal pathway between moral disengagement and harassment proclivity, and the psychological mechanisms (emotions and moral judgment) that underlie this relationship. Taken together, the results suggest that moral disengagement mechanisms are important social cognitions that people use to deny, downplay, and justify workplace sexual harassment. The findings of this thesis also provide preliminary support for the notion that moral disengagement is a self-regulatory process in sexual harassment perpetration at work (cf. Page & Pina, 2015). The thesis concludes with a discussion of theoretical implications of the findings, methodological limitations, practical implications, and suggestions of future research avenues...|$|E
40|$|Current sport {{morality}} {{research has}} been pursued {{in an effort to}} understand what leads athletes to engage in unethical behaviors in sport (Weiss, Smith, 2 ̆ 6 Stuntz, 2008). One emerging area of research targets moral disengagement, the suspension of moral standards in an effort to reduce the <b>self-censure</b> typically experienced when violating these standards (Bandura, 1991). To date this work has largely emphasized the outcomes of moral disengagement, such as its positive relationship with antisocial behavior (Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara, 2 ̆ 6 Pastorelli, 1996; Bandura, Caprara, Barbaranelli, Pastorelli, 2 ̆ 6 Regalia, 2001; Boardley 2 ̆ 6 Kavussanu, 2007; 2008 a, 2008 b, 2009), leaving a gap in the understanding of the antecedents of moral disengagement. Accordingly, in an effort to extend previous work on moral disengagement, the primary {{purpose of this study was}} to empirically examine proposed antecedents of moral disengagement in sport. Four individual difference factors (i. e., empathy, moral awareness, ego goal orientation, personal sport importance) and one situational factor (i. e., perceived teammate cheating and aggressive behavior) were examined as independent and combined predictors of moral disengagement in sport. Finally, the relationship of athletes 2 ̆ 7 moral disengagement with self-reported cheating and aggressive behavior was examined, and the potential mediating role of moral disengagement in the relationship of the antecedents with cheating and aggressive behaviors in sport was tested. Male (n = 213) and female (n = 194) high school basketball and soccer players completed psychometrically sound measures of sport empathy, moral awareness, goal orientations, perceived teammate behavior, personal sport importance, moral disengagement, and cheating and aggressive behavior to examine the study purposes. ^ Results from multiple regression analyses indicated that sport empathy and moral awareness negatively and independently predict, while ego goal orientation and perceived teammate behavior positively and independently predict, the use of moral disengagement in sport. Moral disengagement in turn positively predicts athletes 2 ̆ 7 self-reported engagement in cheating and aggressive behaviors. Additionally, sport empathy and ego orientation moderated the relationship of perceived teammate behavior with moral disengagement. Perceived teammate behavior was associated more strongly with moral disengagement when scores on ego orientation were greater, and less strongly with moral disengagement when scores on sport empathy were greater. Moral disengagement partially mediated the relationship of sport empathy, moral awareness, and perceived teammate behavior and fully mediated the relationship of ego goal orientation, with athletes 2 ̆ 7 self-reported engagement in cheating and aggressive behaviors. Finally, while not expected, task goal orientation emerged as a positive predictor of moral disengagement. In addition, moral disengagement fully mediated the relationship of task orientation with athletes 2 ̆ 7 self-reported cheating and aggressive behaviors. ^ This study extends previous research on moral disengagement by empirically identifying individual difference (sport empathy, moral awareness, goal orientations) and social (perceived teammate behavior) factors that predict the use of moral disengagement, particularly within the sport context. These antecedents accounted for a meaningful amount of variance in moral disengagement, suggesting that sport empathy, moral awareness, goal orientations, and perceived teammate behavior are important contributors to athletes 2 ̆ 7 moral disengagement. Moreover, moral disengagement accounted for a meaningful amount of variance in cheating and aggressive behavior, supporting Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s (1991, 2002) contention that moral disengagement links with the incidence of unethical behaviors. Along with the mediation findings, the present work suggests that developing strategies to enhance sport empathy, moral awareness, and task involvement has potential for diminishing the use of moral disengagement in sport and, in turn, cheating and aggressive behavior. Additionally, tactics that temper levels of ego goal orientation and perceived engagement in cheating and aggression by teammates may also diminish the use of moral disengagement in sport and, in turn, cheating and aggressive behavior. ...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{the work}} of Estonian journalists can be defined as follows: changes in professionalism (professional {{training}} and experience, specialisation in a specific topic, professional skills); organisational changes (the division of work in the editor´s office, the relationships between the editors and the reporters, customary practices prevalent in an organisation), technological changes (technical ability, multi-skills) and the changes in freedom of professional choice (professional autonomy: the freedom to choose the topic and the point of view, the nature of control prevalent in editor’s office). The changes are especially evident in the field of professionalism. After the reign of young and inexperienced journalists (so-called juvenile reporters) there was a certain degree of professionalisation, but the last few decades have witnessed a decrease in specialisation among the journalists. They are rather oriented towards mass audience, drawing on a certain genre (news). From a professional point of view this could be seen as a setback. A closer look at the organisational changes seems to support the author’s hypothesis that editor’s offices in Estonia are editor-centered and use quite a considerable amount of control. The journalists’ workload tends to be high, whereas their freedom of choice is rather small. Moreover, the results confirmed the assumption that freedom of professional choice is less important for the journalists than before. Interviews with experts also confirmed the hypothesis that transition from the controlled system to the system of free journalism had considerably stronger influence on Estonian journalists than subsequent technological revolution. The only significant contribution of technological revolution seems to be online journalism, which has become the main tool undermining the culture of professional journalism. The new job of a web reporter has made it increasingly easy for inexperienced journalists to enter the professional field and created a new wave of juvenile journalists, which is not as numerous as in 1990 s, but still there. The application of web-based approaches to newspaper-making has left its print on traditional quality requirements and customary working practices. 106 The study also confirmed the hypothesis of generation gap, which seems to be charateristic to transitional countries and divides journalists into pre-revolution and post-revolution generations. Like in other countries, it is commonly believed that the older generation follows the professional and societal values more closely, the younger generation, on the other hand, is less inclined to let the professional values interfere with their careers (Metyakova, Cisarova, 2009). Experts believe that professional culture has experienced some setbacks and a number of strong personalities have moved away from journalism. The experts describe present-day journalism and present-day journalists as “mediocre”, “loyal to their bosses”, “irresponsible”, “not interested in their main characters” and “a lot of nobodies”. Experts agree that American practices and hierarchical and controlled culture prevalent in editor’s office are editor-centered. Experts also believe that editors are in many cases technical workers who have no professional skills and whose actions are based on business logic. Some experts think that the professional quality of Estonian editors is below standard. The study also supported the assumption that format and layout have considerable influence on journalists’ thinking. As regards changes like continuous reorganisation of editorial work, the effect of economic thinking on journalism, frequent changes in design, format-centeredness, template as an agent changing journalistic thinking, the domination of routine practices over creative work (Kunelius, Ruusunoksa, 2008), dependence on format and its influence on the quality of journalism seemed to have the greatest effect. The influence of economic thinking on editor’s work is less evident for journalists, but it is still possible to experience it at the level of <b>self-censure.</b> In conclusion we can say that the character of Estonian journalism has undergone considerable changes, which have brought about generational differences, made the representatives of pre-revolution generation move away from journalism and created a new wave of young and inexperienced web reporters, which has resulted in deprofessionalisation. The relationships in editor’s office have become more hierarchical and more individualistic, whereas journalists have become less creative. It should be noted that transition to free journalism is not yet finished for Estonian journalists and 107 Estonian journalism, since a number of qualitative and professional values have not yet been achieved, or their development has stopped due to the economic downturn. The process of turning journalism into commercial production, or to the so-called box factories needs to be slowed down. It is high time to understand that instead of bits of information we need competent analysis and added value to the info...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} facts spurred President Clinton {{to make a}} major {{confrontation}} with the American tobacco industry. Being in need of funding for his health care plan, Clinton proposed a tax on cigarettes, a move that immediately set the president {{on a collision course with}} tobacco firms. Contact with health groups during the preparation of the plan also called Clinton’s attention to health risks in connection with smoking. The president was also encouraged by revelations that tobacco companies had lied about the dangers of smoking, that it had deliberately tried to hook children and manipulated the nicotine levels in cigarettes. The fact that Vice-president Al Gore urged Clinton to combat the tobacco industry also had an important bearing on Clinton’s decision to take on tobacco firms. The anti-tobacco commitment of Food and Drug Administration commissioner David Kessler was also of immeasurable importance. Clinton’s endorsement of FDA’s classification of nicotine as a drug and of the FDA rules aimed at curbing youth smoking were Clinton’s most important steps against the tobacco industry during his first term. The fact that Kessler had advised Clinton to focus on youth smoking had provided Clinton with a political strategy in the tobacco issue. After having been assured by his pollster Dick Morris that it would cost him few votes, Clinton raised the tobacco issue in the 1996 presidential election. It was difficult for the Republican candidate Bob Dole, who was a recipient of large tobacco contributions, to sweep away the combat of youth smoking with anti-regulatory GOP rhetoric. Helped by Dole’s many clumsy remarks about smoking, Clinton managed to portray himself as a candidate who cared about young people’s health. The tobacco issue had become an important Democratic public value. Clinton’s attempt to pass sweeping tobacco legislation in Congress and his attempt to let the FDA regulate tobacco both failed. The President therefore tried to make steps against the industry by means of executive orders and by using the court system. Clinton’s intense focus on the tobacco industry stained its reputation. The President’s commitment in the tobacco issue was founded on idealism as well as on pragmatism. Polls had convinced Clinton that he was not committing political suicide when he raised the tobacco issue in the 1996 presidential election. There were strong winds of anti-tobacco fervor in the mid- 1990 s and considerable changes in the electorate. The GOP had replaced the Democratic Party as the dominant party in the South. Furthermore, in the 1990 s the Southern Democratic vote tended to be found in areas with high- tech industries rather than in rural areas. A courageous Clinton understood that conditions most likely were the right for an anti-tobacco president. In my opinion, the 1996 presidential election revolutionized tobacco’s role in American politics. Before 1996, politicians who wished to take steps against the tobacco industry did not have the courage to do so for fear of losing votes. After 1996, tobacco connections and a pro-tobacco stance tended to hurt politically. Inspired by the success of the Contract with America, the Democrats developed a national platform which called for tobacco legislation before the 1998 election. Democratic diversity in the tobacco case had developed into unity. The enormous wealth of the tobacco companies permitted them to strike back at Clinton in a number of ways. The ties between the Republican Party and the tobacco companies were strengthened during the Clinton presidency. By giving heavy financial support to organizations and think thanks which exerted influence on the GOP, the tobacco industry managed to portray regulation of tobacco as a violation of Republican ideology. In this period, the GOP became more and more dependent on the votes from the religious right. However, these newcomers in the Republican Party with their pro-life stance did at best turn a blind eye on the tobacco issue. Tobacco-growing states often were strongholds of the religious right, and a number of conservative members of Congress who represented religious groups were staunch allies of the tobacco industry. Well aware of their tattered reputations the tobacco companies tried to fight tobacco regulations, making sure that the word tobacco was not even mentioned. The financial support of anti-tax groups which exerted influence in the GOP became very important in this respect. Contributions to the Republican Party and Republican members of Congress sky-rocketed in the mid- 1990 s. Studies showed that there was a high correlation between ample tobacco contributions to members of Congress and pro-tobacco votes cast in Congress. An army of tobacco lobbyists was also instrumental in persuading members of Congress to vote in favor of the tobacco industry. The fact that the enormous wealth of the tobacco industry contributed to its vast political clout can be seen as a purchase of influence and a weakening of democracy. The campaign finance reforms of the Feingold-McCain Act of 2002 can therefore be seen as a strengthening of democracy in the United States. The tobacco companies tried to sway public opinion by influencing and controlling the mass media. The industry launched expensive advertising campaigns designed to improve its fringed reputation. Heavy financial support to so-called neutral think thanks often resulted in media inserts which were favorable to the tobacco industry. Business synergy, tobacco-owned media-outlets, and the enormous advertising power of the tobacco industry also led to <b>self-censure</b> of media companies. Studies show that publications dependent on tobacco advertisement often failed to print articles which were unfavorable to the tobacco companies. I find it disquieting that the tobacco companies provoked <b>self-censure</b> in the mass media. It suggests that freedom of speech in democracies can be impaired when business corporations become too powerful. The establishment of the internet made it easier to get anti-tobacco articles, reports from whistleblowers etc. to the public. However, the tobacco companies had another weapon, the courts. Scientists and TVstations alike were threatened with legal prosecution, a practice that probably had a preventive effect. Since research had ascertained the detrimental effects of smoking, it was no longer possible for the tobacco companies to claim the opposite. It was therefore of vital importance for the tobacco industry to draw attention away from health risks in connection with tobacco use. Smoking was instead presented as a civil liberty issue. Helped by their support to so-called neutral organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, the tobacco companies portrayed regulation of tobacco as a violation of the freedom of American citizens. The curbing of advertisement aimed at minors was represented as a violation of freedom of speech. This strategy permeated both the political efforts and PR efforts of the tobacco companies. Haunted by accusations of illegal behavior, President Clinton initiated the appointment of a special counsel to look into the Whitewater affair. This move turned out to be a serious mistake inasmuch as it eventually led to the appointment of Kenneth Starr. The fact that moderate Republican Robert Fiske, who had been appointed independent counsel in early 1994, did not find anything illicit on the Clintons probably led to his ousting. There is every indication that the replacement of Robert Fiske with Kenneth Starr was politically motivated and that tobacco interests were involved. The fact that Kenneth Starr continued defending tobacco firms while investigating an anti-tobacco president was a serious conflict of interest. Starr’s investigation seemed to be a fishing trip for possible wrongdoing rather than an investigation of illicit behavior. After years of investigation Starr was not able to prove that the Clintons had done anything illegal in the Whitewater affair. He also drew the conclusion that Vincent Foster’s death was a suicide. Fiske had concluded similarly years before. Starr finally got a nibble when he discovered the relationship between the President and Monica Lewinsky. Starr was involved in the Paula Jones case, and I think there are indications that a perjury trap was deliberately set for Clinton when he was asked about his relationship with Lewinsky in the Paula Jones case. Clinton’s denial under oath of having a sexual relationship with Lewinsky led to the impeachment process. American tobacco companies had an enormous clout in the Republican Party which pressed for impeachment of the president. House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, a recipient of vast tobacco contributions, was instrumental in omitting the possibility of censuring Clinton and in reviving the impeachment drive in Congress after the 1998 congressional elections. Resentment against the American tobacco industry grew in intensity after the fall of the Soviet Union. The absence of an external enemy may have made the Americans more aware of negative factors within their own country. In this respect, the American tobacco companies can be said to have replaced "the evil" empire in many Americans' minds. After having been under fire in the Clinton period, the tobacco companies must have drawn a sign of relief when George W. Bush defeated the anti-smoking Al Gore. George W. Bush, who had not accepted campaign contributions from tobacco companies while he was governor in Texas, received ample tobacco contributions during his campaign for the presidency. When elected President, Bush appointed many top level aids who had been friendly towards the tobacco industry in the past, among others attorney general John Ashcroft. The Bush administration's reluctance to carry on the Justice Department's case against the tobacco companies may be indicative of tight links between the industry and George W. Bush. President Clinton’s anti-tobacco commitment was marked by political will, courage and strategic skills; all the same, he did not achieve much when it comes to tobacco legislation. Clinton’s general left turn, and unilateralism when preparing his health care plan probably led to the democratic debacle in the 1994 congressional elections. The prospects for sweeping tobacco legislation during Clinton’s second term would have been much brighter with a democratic majority in Congress...|$|E
