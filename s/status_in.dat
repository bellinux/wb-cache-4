50|$|Ascribed statuses are {{determined}} by the dominant groups in society and as a result, minorities are often assigned lower statuses. Minority groups are forced to attempt to reconcile the conflicts that arise from the social expectations that are linked with their assigned <b>statuses</b> <b>in</b> society and their perceived view of themselves. In the face of the knowledge that individuals occupy more than one ascribed role at a time, it becomes evident that there may be some <b>statuses</b> <b>in</b> society’s multi-dimensional structure that do not comfortably coexist.|$|R

5|$|The 1979 general {{election}} brought a Conservative government {{to power and}} allowed the Council to shift its focus towards retaining Grammar Schools where they still existed and improving schools where work had been put on hold during the comprehensive debate; despite 90% of English councils adopting comprehensive education, Lincolnshire had retained its grammar schools. Although the County Council began discussing the abolition of them again in 1985, opposition from parents at a public consultation in 1987 resulted in the plans being dropped. With the question of its future resolved, Carre's applied for grant-maintained <b>status</b> <b>in</b> 1989; the Education Secretary approved the proposals and formally granted the <b>status</b> <b>in</b> September 1990. When grant-maintained status was abolished in 1999, Carre's became a Foundation School. Following a successful bid to the DfES, submitted in October 2002, the school was granted specialist Sports College <b>status</b> <b>in</b> 2003. An all-weather pitch was laid out in 2007, and a new technology building with a fitness suite opened in 2011. In 2009, Carre's became a specialist Science College and a lead school for gifted and talented students. The school converted to Academy <b>status</b> <b>in</b> August 2011. In 2014, the governors announced their intention to bid for conversion to a multi-Academy trust and become a coeducational, selective school on a new site; in February 2015, Kesteven and Sleaford High School announced its intention to join the proposed trust, a moved welcomed by Carre's. Carre's officially {{became part of the}} Robert Carre Multi-Academy Trust on 1 September 2015; the schools continue to operate on their sites, sharing staff and facilities.|$|E

40|$|Background Emerging {{adulthood}} is a core developmental {{period in}} which individuals can develop a meaningful identity in the relational domain (with a romantic partner). The aim {{of the study was}} to examine relationships between relations with parents and identity <b>statuses</b> <b>in</b> the relational domain in emerging adults. Participants and procedure Participants were 266 (47. 30 % males) emerging adults (M = 22. 50, SD = 1. 73). They completed self-report measures of relations with parents and identity. Results More than half of the participants were <b>in</b> the moratorium <b>status</b> or were not involved in a romantic relationship (35 % and 29 %, respectively). Relations with parents were linked to identity <b>statuses</b> <b>in</b> the relational domain. Particularly, the perception of low autonomy given by the father was related to less mature identity statuses. Conclusions This study highlighted that transition from singleness to stable partnerships seems to be challenging. Therefore, it is important to examine correlates of identity <b>statuses</b> <b>in</b> this domain...|$|R
