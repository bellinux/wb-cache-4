40|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characterization of several {{sizes and shapes}} of alkaline and saline spent Zn–MnO 2 batteries was carried out, aiming at contributing for a better definition of the applicable recycling processes. The characterization essays included the mass balance of the components, cathode and anode elemental analysis, the identification of zinc and manganese bearing phases and the morphology analysis of the electrode particles. The electrode materials correspond to 64 – 79 % of the total weigh of the batteries, with the cathodes having clearly the highest contribution (usually more than 50 %). The steel components, mainly from the cases, are also important (17 – 30 %). Elemental analysis showed that the electrodes are highly concentrated in zinc (from 48 – 87 % in anodes) and manganese (from 35 – 50 % in cathodes). X-Ray powder diffraction allowed for identifying several phases in the electrodes, namely zinc oxide, in the anodes of all the types of saline and alkaline batteries tested, while zinc hydroxide chloride and ammine zinc chloride only appear in some types of saline batteries. The manganese found in the cathode materials is present as two main phases, MnO·Mn 2 O 3 and ZnO·Mn 2 O 3, the latter corroborating that zinc migration from anode to cathode occurs during the batteries lifespan. A unreacted MnO 2 phase was also found presenting a low crystalline level. Leaching trials with diluted HCl solutions of alkaline and <b>saline</b> <b>battery</b> samples showed that all zinc species are reactive attaining easily over than 90 % leaching yields, and about 30 % of manganese, present as Mn(ii/iii) forms. The MnO 2 phase is less reactive and requires higher temperatures to achieve a more efficient solubilization...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{processing}} of spent batteries which includes shredding and sieving operation {{is the first}} step for chemical treatment by hydrometallurgy. A laboratory study was carried out to evaluate physical processing efficiency, by analysing the resulting particle size, of alkaline and saline mignon-type Zn-MnO 2 batteries. After shredding with a tip shredder, results obtained showed that alkaline batteries were more efficiently size reduced than <b>saline</b> <b>batteries.</b> Difference in particle size distribution was larger for granulometric fraction - 20 + 11. 2 mm and also higher for <b>saline</b> <b>batteries.</b> Average diameters (d 50) for <b>saline</b> and alkaline <b>batteries</b> were respectively 9. 1 and 6. 2 mm. Chemical composition carried out on several granulometric fractions allowed to identify metals distribution through size categories. This analysis showed that zinc concentration with the grain size was almost constant, while manganese decreased when particle size increased. More than 95 % of iron scarp from the battery cases had a particle size higher than 5. 6 mm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Laboratorial {{studies were}} carried out to characterise the {{influence}} of different cutting systems (grab shredder and cutting mill) on the physical processing efficiency of spent Zn-MnO 2 batteries. The grab shredder operate based on an indented cutting rotor which applies shear and abrasion stresses with a moderate rotation speed, while the cutting mill operation is based on shear and impact stresses at higher rotation speed. After shredding with the grab shredder, two fractions of material were obtained (above and below the 6 mm discharge grid), which allows a previous separation of the scrap. With the cutting mill, all the grinded material passed the bottom grid (with the same 6 mm opening). Results obtained showed that alkaline batteries were more efficiently shredded than <b>saline</b> <b>batteries,</b> mainly with the grab shredder. Average diameters (d 50) for <b>saline</b> and alkaline <b>batteries</b> fragmented with the grab shredder were 2. 29 and 1. 47 mm respectively, while with the cutting mill were 3. 09 and 1. 54 mm respectively. Chemical analyses {{were carried out}} for different size fractions allowing identifying metals distribution through size categories. In general chemical composition was not substantially different using both shredding systems. Zinc distribution was almost constant with the grain size while manganese distribution decreased with particle size. More than 94 % of the iron scrap from the battery cases presents a particle size highe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Domestic-type {{batteries}} {{sample was}} tested aiming at its characterization and {{the evaluation of}} the feasibility of physical separation of its main components. The sample was essentially constituted by saline and alkaline types (Zn-MnO 2 based systems,> 90 % w/w) and cylindrical shape (> 90 % w/w). The mass balance of alkaline battery samples indicated as main battery components the steel case materials (25 %), the electrodes (71 %) and the connector and separator/insulating materials (4 %), while the corresponding values to the saline type are 16 %, 72 % and 12 % respectively. Despite electrochemical principles are similar, internal constitution of <b>saline</b> and alkaline <b>batteries</b> is different. Differences in electrolytes are also relevant (KOH in alkaline type and chloride salts in saline type) affecting therefore the mass balances in the chemical treatment. Fragmentation of batteries was done aiming at to evaluate the efficiency of the liberation of different components, namely scrap and electrodes. Results obtained are very promising considering the good efficiency reached on the physical separation treatment and consequently the chemical step will be necessarily improved...|$|R

A <b>battery</b> of neurological tests was applied following the intrapertoneal injections. Results of rota rod indicated that CGP 35348 had no effect on neuromuscular coordination in both male (P= 0. 528) and female (P= 0. 125) albino mice. CGP 35348 treated females demonstrated poor exploratory behavior during open filed for several parameters (time mobile (P= 0. 04), time immobile (P= 0. 04), rotations (P= 0. 04), and anticlockwise rotations (P= 0. 038)). The results for Morris water maze (MWM) retention phase indicated that CGP 35348 treated male mice took shorter latency to reach the hidden platform (P= 0. 04) than control indicating improved memory. This observation was complemented by the swim strategies used by mice during training days in MWM as CGP 35348 treated males used more direct and focal approach to reach the platform as the training proceeded...|$|R
