25|$|In {{accordance}} with the traditional view of Aristotle, the Hellenistic Greeks generally preferred to distinguish the potential infinity from the actual infinity; for example, instead of <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> an infinity of primes, Euclid prefers instead to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> more prime numbers than contained in any given collection of prime numbers.|$|R

25|$|Hyperexcitability hypothesizes that {{referred}} pain has no central mechanism. However, it does <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> one central characteristic that predominates. Experiments involving {{noxious stimuli and}} recordings from the dorsal horn of animals revealed that {{referred pain}} sensations began minutes after muscle stimulation. Pain was felt in a receptive field that was some distance away from the original receptive field. According to hyperexcitability, new receptive fields are created {{as a result of}} the opening of latent convergent afferent fibers in the dorsal horn. This signal could then be perceived as referred pain.|$|E

25|$|The Central Tibetan Administration {{also says}} that {{millions}} of Chinese immigrants to the TAR are diluting the Tibetans both culturally and through intermarriage. Exile groups say that despite recent attempts to restore the appearance of original Tibetan culture to attract tourism, the traditional Tibetan {{way of life is}} now irrevocably changed. It is also reported that when Hu Yaobang, the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, visited Lhasa in 1980 he was unhappy when he found out the region was behind neighbouring provinces. Reforms were instituted, and since then the central government's policy in Tibet has granted most religious freedoms. But monks and nuns are still sometimes imprisoned, and many Tibetans (mostly monks and nuns) continue to flee Tibet yearly. At the same time, many Tibetans believe projects that the PRC implement to benefit Tibet, such as the China Western Development economic plan or the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, are politically motivated actions to consolidate central control over Tibet by facilitating militarization and Han Chinese migration while benefiting few Tibetans; they also believe the money funneled into cultural restoration projects as being aimed at attracting foreign tourists. They also <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> still preferential treatment awarded to Han Chinese in the labor market as opposed to Tibetans.|$|E
500|$|This {{study of}} nature {{translated}} into {{his use of}} ruled geometrical forms such as the hyperbolic paraboloid, the hyperboloid, the helicoid and the cone, which reflect the forms Gaudí found in nature. Ruled surfaces are forms generated by a straight line known as the generatrix, as it moves over one or several lines known as directrices. Gaudí found abundant examples of them in nature, for instance in rushes, reeds and bones; he used to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no better structure than {{the trunk of a}} tree or a human skeleton. These forms are at the same time functional and aesthetic, and Gaudí discovered how to adapt the language of nature to the structural forms of architecture.

500|$|Beyoncé {{has worked}} with {{numerous}} directors for her music videos throughout her career, including Melina Matsoukas, Jonas Åkerlund, and Jake Nava. India Hill of Teen Vogue wrote, [...] "When Beyoncé does something, you listen. Not just because her lyrics are infectious and her beats are always catchy, but because if she has something to say, you know it’s going to be important." [...] Megan Carpentier of The Guardian commented [...] "It is not an exaggeration to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no other living musical artist who could ignite such a broad and unavoidable conversation just by releasing a new album – even a visual one, and it’s her second visual album – or who could turn an hour-long, visually narrative film for that album into a Saturday night watch-with-your-friends event on subscription cable channel." [...] Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the LEMONADE visuals in particular served as inspiration for the Beauty and the Beast film, commenting [...] "You look at Beyonce’s brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms… I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want." [...] Beyoncé's music videos explore many different topics and themes such as women empowerment, depression, affairs, and racial injustice, including [...] "Formation" [...] and [...] "Pretty Hurts". Her self-titled visual album explores darker music videos such as [...] "Haunted", which drew comparisons to Madonna's Justify My Love". In 2017, she released the controversial music video for [...] "Formation", which includes representations of racial injustice against African Americans in the United States during the Black Lives Matter movement.|$|E
500|$|The {{state of}} Veracruz {{used to be}} {{controlled}} by the Gulf Cartel before business was handed over to Los Zetas, their former allies, when they went to war across northeastern Mexico in early 2010. Since 2011, much of the drug-related violence {{is a result of the}} turf wars between Los Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel, a drug trafficking organization based in western Mexico and headed by Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán, Mexico's most-wanted drug lord. These criminal groups are fighting for Veracruz because of its lucrative smuggling routes for contraband, drug trafficking, and illegal migrants heading to the United States. It has one of Mexico's busiest ports, and officials <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no way they can inspect all of the containers that come in by ship. Corruption is also widespread in Veracruz; investigators have been slow and reluctant to link the Martínez Pérez murder to organized crime. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Veracruz is by [...] "general consensus one of the most politically corrupt [...] ". Mexico was ruled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) for 71 years until it lost the presidential seat to the conservative National Action Party (PAN) in 2000. The PRI has long been criticized for being corrupt and allowing the drug trafficking organizations in the country to operate freely if they maintained relative peace. Although the PRI lost the national presidency in 2000, some states remained under the rule of PRI politicians. [...] "Democratic transition never quite reached Veracruz," [...] a state of 8 million people. PRI governors in Veracruz continued to rule with the state with tactics largely abandoned by the PRI at a national level.|$|E
