Algal community dynamics were related to seasonal variations and interactions of several physical, chemical, and biological factors. Algal bianass maxima coincided with increases in light, nutrients, temperature, and turbulence during fall and <b>spring</b> <b>overturn</b> and in early to mid-summer. Growth characteristics and vertical distribution of bianass varied greatly from season to season with shifts in species composition and were indicative of productive lakes. The periodicity and distribution of in situ rates of primary productivity were also characteristic of fertile lakes. Integral photosynthesis ranged from 200 to 300 mg C m 2 h- 1, indicating mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions. Bioassays for nutrient limitation indicate that algal growth in both lakes is phosphorus-limited during the summer months.

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades there has been an {{increasing}} use of teleconnection indices based on different climatic patterns {{in order to understand the}} mechanisms linking weather and temporal changes in ecosystems. Many investigations showed a strong impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the air temperatures and tmospheric precipitation over large areas of the northern hemisphere in winter. In southern Europe, further studies confirmed a causal connection between NAO and precipitation, whereas the relationships between NAO and temperatures appeared not always of general value. The first studies carried out in Lake Garda proved how the winter NAO had only a slight, non-significant influence on the winter climate and water temperatures at maximum <b>spring</b> <b>overturn.</b> By converse, in the very recent years, investigations showed a strong impact on the local subalpine winter climate of at least two distinct modes of atmospheric oscillations, namely the East Atlantic pattern (EA) and the Eastern Mediterranean Pattern (EMP). Winter interannual fluctuations of the EA and EMP triggered a long chain of causally-linked effects, including changes in spring water temperatures, deep spring mixing dynamics, hypolimnetic oxygen changes, and epilimnetic spring replenishment of nutrients as well as changes in phytoplankton development and phenology of the dominant cladocerans. These results were confirmed also in a recent analysis made in the other deep lakes south of the Alps (Salmaso et al. 1). It will be stressed how the East Atlantic pattern and the Eastern Mediterranean Pattern could represent two efficient teleconnection indices useful to analyse the interannual changes in aquatic environments located in the whole Mediterranean region...|$|E

40|$|Many {{distinct}} climate anomalies {{related to}} each other over large distances were identified both in the northern and southern hemispheres. Among these, the North Atlantic Oscillation was identified as the most important teleconnection index in the North Atlantic region, with important effects on lacustrine ecosystems in Central and Northern Europe. By converse, no measurable effects were shown on the limnological characteristics of the deep lakes south of the Alps. Recent studies carried out in Lake Garda showed a strong impact on the local climate and limnology of the southern Alpine district of two distinct modes of atmospheric oscillations relevant for the Mediterranean area, namely the East Atlantic pattern (EA) and the Eastern Mediterranean Pattern (EMP). Positive and negative EA, and negative and positive EMP phases are connected with the development of mild and harsh winters, respectively. In this work we analysed the impact of EA and EMP on the largest lakes located at the southern flanks of the Alps (Garda, Iseo, Como, Lugano and Maggiore). The results showed an extended impact of EA and EMP on the winter air temperatures, thermal structure and deep mixing dynamics. In turn, harsh winters and deeper spring mixing depths in lakes Garda, Iseo and Como had a strong and positive influence on the replenishment of epilimnetic phosphorus at <b>spring</b> <b>overturn.</b> Owing to the lower differences in the content of total phosphorus (TP) in the surface and hypolimnetic layers, the effects of a deep mixing on the epilimnetic replenishment of nutrients in Lake Maggiore were less distinct.

40|$|Boreal lakes are {{important}} net sources {{of greenhouse gases}} (GHGs). In this study we analyzed concentrations of CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O as well as O 2, N 2 and argon (Ar) from the epilimnion of 75 boreal lakes covering gradients in total organic carbon (TOC), phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) deposition. The Ar-corrected gas saturation deficit {{was used as a}} proxy of net metabolic changes from <b>spring</b> <b>overturn</b> to mid-summer sampling (all lakes were dimictic). Emission fluxes were calculated for CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O based on partial pressure, water temperature and wind speed. Gas concentrations, actual and Ar-corrected, were related to lake-specific properties. TOC was the main predictor of CO 2 concentrations and fluxes, followed by total P, while total P and chlorophyll a governed CH 4 concentrations and fluxes. Nitrogen (NO 3 − or total N) were key predictors of N 2 O concentrations and fluxes, followed by total P. Altitude, area and depth were not strong predictors of CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O concentrations and fluxes, likely because only lakes with an area of > 1 km 2 were included. CO 2 molar concentrations were negatively correlated with O 2 concentrations, while the slope of CO 2 concentration to Ar corrected O 2 deficit was 1. 039. Together with the poor correlation between area-specific primary production and CO 2 as well as O 2, this suggests that these gases are mostly affected by catabolic processes and probably photo-oxidation in these nutrient-poor, boreal lakes investigated in this study. Increasing inputs of TOC (i. e. lake “browning”) is likely to promote the net heterotrophy and hence emissions of all GHGs, while elevated N deposition in particular may cause elevated emissions of N 2 O...|$|E

With modern data for representative Maine lakes and historical (1932) data on dissolved gases reported for northern Wisconsin lakes, the apparent respiratory quotient relating ACO, to A 02 = 0. 92. The above model yields alkalinity estimates with a relative root-mean-square (RMS) error of- 15 %. The alkalinities of the Maine lakes have increased by 15 - 50 peq liter- ’ (> 30 %) since the original surveys. Lake alkalization is {{not the result of}} differences in antecedent weather, since abnormally dry weather predating 1942 would have acted to elevate alkalinities. Environmental research in northern Eu-rope and eastern North America generally supports. the hypothesis that the long-term deposition of excess sulfuric acid on geo-logically vulnerable watersheds results in partial losses of surf&ce-water alkalinity and, in extreme cases, to severe regional lake and stream acidification (Gorham 1984). The reconstruction of historical changes in lake alkalinity in Maine has proved difficult be-cause, with few exceptions (e. g. Moosehead Lake, summer 1944), the extensive pio-neering lake surveys of Cooper (19 39 - 1946) made no measurements of alkalinity.

40|$|A linked {{chain of}} causal factors—namely, winter air temperature, spring lake temperature, {{extent of the}} <b>spring</b> lake <b>overturn,</b> and extent of surface {{nutrient}} enrichment—had significant effects on the annual development of phytoplankton structure and biomass in Lake Garda, a large (49 3 109 m 3), deep (350 m) lake located south of the Alps. The relationship between the winter climate and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was unclear, probably because of {{the location of the}} lake, which was on the border between different centers of action of the NAO (the Mediterranean region and central and northern Europe). Soon after the major enrichment episodes, conjugatophytes and large diatoms developed with higher biovolumes during April, whereas from midsummer to midautumn, the cyanobacteria and, more irregularly, the conjugatophytes were more important. In two other deep southern subalpine lakes (Iseo and Lugano), the interannual variations in the extent of spring vertical mixing, nutrient replenishment, and phytoplankton development were closely related because of the common effects of winter climate on the subalpine region. The effect was proportionally more evident in the two meromictic and more eutrophic lakes, Iseo and Lugano, because of the higher nutrient content in their hypolimnia.

This study considered multi-year δ 18 O values for six different lakes located in the Italian Alps. We studied δ 18 O values of two large (L. Caldonazzo and L. Levico) and four small lakes (L. Lavarone, L. Santo di Cembra, L. Serraia, and L. Tovel) characterised by different hydrological regimes (> or or < 50 ha). Differences in isotope composition along the water column, between years and layers were used to investigate the extend of lake water renewal, mixis, stratification, and groundwater infiltration. Lakes with short renewal time had significantly different <b>spring</b> <b>overturn</b> values, while lakes with longer renewal time had substantially constant values. The isotope content of the water column also clarified the extent of mixis for some lakes: Lavarone underwent complete mixing only in some years, while Tovel, previously considered meromictic, could no longer be considered as such. With the exception of L. Tovel, characterised by a peculiar hydrology, thermal stratification was reflected in yearly isotope patterns. Analysis of hypolimnetic isotope values indicated that in L. Lavarone and L. Serraia strong storm events altered summer hypolimnetic δ 18 O values suggesting groundwater infiltration. Furthermore, epilimnetic isotope enrichment was related to lake elevation by a linear relationship. The extraordinarily hot 2003 summer led to a higher evaporation with respect to other years considered. Multi-annual data on the isotopic values of rainfall for L. Tovel (1178 m a. s. l.) provided the necessary background for data interpretation since precipitation governs isotope inputs.

40|$|In {{thermally}} stratified lakes, {{the greatest}} annual methane emissions typically occur during thermal overturn events. In July of 2012, Greenland experienced significant warming {{that resulted in}} substantial melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and enhanced runoff events. This unusual climate phenomenon provided an opportunity {{to examine the effects}} of short-term natural heating on lake thermal structure and methane dynamics and compare these observations with those from the following year, when temperatures were normal. Here, we focus on methane concentrations within the water column of five adjacent small lakes on the ice-free margin of southwestern Greenland under open-water and ice-covered conditions from 2012 – 2014. Enhanced warming of the epilimnion in the lakes under open-water conditions in 2012 led to strong thermal stability and the development of anoxic hypolimnia in each of the lakes. As a result, during open-water conditions, mean dissolved methane concentrations in the water column were significantly (p  <  0. 0001) greater in 2012 than in 2013. In all of the lakes, mean methane concentrations under ice-covered conditions were significantly (p  <  0. 0001) greater than under open-water conditions, suggesting <b>spring</b> <b>overturn</b> is currently the largest annual methane flux to the atmosphere. As the climate continues to warm, shorter ice cover durations are expected, which may reduce the winter inventory of methane and lead to a decrease in total methane flux during ice melt. Under open-water conditions, greater heat income and warming of lake surface waters will lead to increased thermal stratification and hypolimnetic anoxia, which will consequently result in increased water column inventories of methane. This stored methane will be susceptible to emissions during fall overturn, which may result in a shift in greatest annual efflux of methane from spring melt to fall overturn. The results of this study suggest that interannual variation in ground-level air temperatures may be the primary driver of changes in methane dynamics because it controls both the duration of ice cover and the strength of thermal stratification...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrology}} of the lake-rich Tibetan Plateau {{is important}} for the global climate, yet {{little is known about the}} thermal regime of Tibetan lakes due to scant data. We (i)  investigated the characteristic seasonal temperature patterns and recent trends in the thermal and stratification regimes of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau and (ii)  tested the performance of the one-dimensional lake parameterization scheme FLake for the Tibetan lake system. For this purpose, we combined 3 years of in situ lake temperature measurements, several decades of satellite observations, and the global reanalysis data. We chose the two largest freshwater Tibetan lakes, Ngoring and Gyaring, as study sites. The lake model FLake faithfully reproduced the specific features of the high-altitude lakes and was subsequently applied to reconstruct the vertically resolved heat transport in both lakes during the last 4 decades. The model suggested that Ngoring and Gyaring were ice-covered for about 6 months and stratified in summer for about 4  months per year with a short <b>spring</b> <b>overturn</b> and a longer autumn overturn. In summer the surface mixed boundary layer extended to 6 – 8  m of depth and was about 20  % shallower in the more turbid Gyaring. The thermal regime of the transparent Ngoring responded more strongly to atmospheric forcing than Gyaring, where the higher turbidity damped the response. According to the reanalysis data, air temperatures and humidity have increased, whereas solar radiation has decreased, since the 1970 s. Surprisingly, the modeled mean lake temperatures did not change, nor did the phenology of the ice cover or stratification. Lake surface temperatures in summer increased only marginally. The reason is that the increase in air temperature was offset by the decrease in radiation, probably due to increasing humidity. This study demonstrates that air temperature trends are not directly coupled to lake temperatures and underscores the importance of shortwave radiation for the thermal regime of high-altitude lakes...|$|E

The main seasonal {{variations in the}} physical, chemical and biological parameters are described, with special emphasis on the comparison of external forcing (weather and atmospheric deposition) with internal lake dynamics. Annual mean air temperature {{was estimated to be}} 3. 6 °C. The duration of ice cover on the lake was 4. 5 months in 1996 / 97 and 5. 8 months in 1997 / 98. The lake water was very ionpoor (mean annual conductivity 12 μS cm- 1); however, ion concentrations in the lake were higher than in the precipitation, the differences being due mainly to Ca 2 + and bicarbonates originating in the catchment. NH 4 + was the main ion in the precipitation, with an average concentration of 17 μM, while in the lake it was always below 3 μM. However, the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen always exceeded that of soluble reactive phosphorus by two or three orders of magnitude, so the latter {{is likely to be the}} limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth. Four main production episodes were identified, occurring during <b>spring</b> and autumn <b>overturn,</b> in the upper hypolimnion during summer stratification, and under the ice at the beginning of the ice-covered period. The highest chlorophyll-a concentrations (1. 2 - 2. 2 μg l- 1) were attained during spring overturn; concentrations of chlorophyll-c were high during both <b>spring</b> and autumn <b>overturn,</b> while chlorophyll-b was comparatively important in the upper hypolimnion during the stratification period. Daphnia pulicaria was the most abundant macrozooplankton species; its abundance was highest during the icecovered period, when its biomass was comparable to the measured sestonic particulate carbon concentration.

Although parameterization i dicated that double diffusion should be expected, we found only circumstantial evidence of associated step structure. The available data suggest that groundwater inflow created a warm salty pool of water at the base of the water column, giving the appearance of a meromictic structure with a monimolimnion. However, this pool was noi. a consistent feature, suggesting both a variable inflow and significant diffusion rates. From the temperature data, estimates indicated that hypolimnetic vertical eddy diffusivity varied between 1 X 10 e 7 and 5 X lo- ” m * s-l.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to simulate seasonal water temperature cycles and stratification in five large lakes in Minnesota under a 2 xCOz climate warming scenario and to compare the results with those under the present (1983 - 1990) climate. The five lakes studied were Mille Lacs Lake, Upper Red Lake, Lake Vermillion, Lake Pepin and Rainy Lake. MINLAKE 96, a one dimensional, unsteady water quality model, was employed. The values of some parameters which describe lake water temperature and ice characteristics are extracted from the simulation results for both present and 2 xC 02 climate scenarios. Results are presented for surface temperatures, bottom temperatures, and differences between surface and bottom water temperatures under the two climate scenarios. Time series for ice thickness are also presented. During the open water season, water temperatures are projected to increase in the entire lake. The maximum increase is usually in early spring. In the ice cover season, water temperatures may decrease slightly with climate change, especially near the lake bottom. In deep Rainy Lake the decrease is more than in the shallow Upper Red Lake. Bottom temperatures less than 8 DC are found during a shorter period under a 2 xCOz climate scenario. This will affect the growth of fish. During the ice cover season the climate change tends to weaken the inverse stratification. In the open water season climate change strengthens stratification. Ice is thinner under a 2 xCOz climate scenario most of the time, but not all the time. Thicker ice cover is caused by absence of snow. Snowfall and snow depths are smaller under a 2 xCOz climate scenario. Ice-in dates are later and ice-out dates are earlier under a 2 xCOz climate scenario. Thus ice cover duration is shorter by an average of 49 days (range from 34 to 73 days). Ice cover also becomes less continuous. The shorter ice cover duration will decrease the possibility of anoxic conditions (winterkill) in lakes during the ice cover season.

The surface waters of both lakes are oversaturated, and the bottom waters undersaturated, with respect to CaCO 3 during the summer. The small amount of CaCO 3 that is precipitated in the epilimnion of Williams Lake during the summer is dissolved in the undersaturated hypolimnion and sediments with the result that no CaCO 3 is incorporated into the profundal surface sediments. Because of the high phytoplankton productivity of Shingobee Lake, sufficient CaCO 3 is produced in the epilimnion that large amounts survive the corrosive hypolimnion and sediments, and an average of 46 wt. % accumulates in surface sediments. Another consequence of higher phytoplankton productivity in Shingobee Lake is that the hypolimnion becomes oxygen deficient within a month after overturn in both the spring and fall. Because of reducing conditions that develop in the hypolimnion of Shingobee Lake, high concentrations of dissolved Fe and Mn accumulate there during summer stratification. Precipitation of Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides during periods of fall and <b>spring</b> <b>overturn</b> results in high concentrations of Fe and Mn in surface sediments. In Williams Lake, high concentrations of Fe and Mn do not build up in the hypolimnion. The concentration of CaCO 3 is about 80 wt. % in lower Holocene sediments of both lakes. The lower Holocene sediments in both lakes also contain high concentrations of Fe and Mn, and the lower Holocene sediments of Shingobee are laminated. The waters of both lakes had identical values of δ 13 C and δ 18 O during the early Holocene, but the waters of Williams Lake ‘‘evolved’’ during the early Holocene, increasing about 10 ‰ in both δ 13 C and δ 18 O. Deposits of lacustrine marl occur as much as seven meters above the present elevation of Williams Lake, the highest of the two lakes. Taken together, these observations suggest that the lakes were once connected to form a larger lake called Lake Willobee with a hypolimnion that was anoxic, at least seasonally...|$|E
40|$|Eutrophication {{phenomenon}} {{is one of}} the most common water quality problems in reservoirs in many regions. Determining the trophic status of the reservoirs is not a precise process and contains vagueness. Fuzzy set and entropy theories are concepts which can model uncertainty and imprecision in the data and the analysis. In this study, an Entropy-based Fuzzy Eutrophication Index model has been developed for classification of trophic level of Satarkhan Reservoir in the north-western part of Iran. Through the Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation technique, trophic levels were considered as fuzzy sets and a fuzzy evaluation matrix was formed by defining the membership function of water quality indicators. The indicators were weighed by integrating both objective and subjective criteria. In this regard, the entropy method was used to determine the objective weights of the indicators based on the amount of useful information available in the data set and the subjective weight was determined by the analytical hierarchy process using a pairwise comparison done by the expert judgment. Classification of the trophic status of the reservoir was determined by multiplying the weighed vector by the fuzzy evaluation matrix. The results showed that critical months for eutrophication in Satarkhan reservoir occur in autumn and <b>spring</b> after the <b>overturning</b> phenomena. The strength of the results of developed entrophy-based fuzzy entrophication index is that the trophic level in each month was expressed with a degree of certainty. Also due to the ability of the model to integrate different kinds of objective and subjective quality observations considering the information included in the data, the proposed model is more robust than the previous index models such as Trophic Status Index and fuzzy trophic index...|$|R
60|$|Some field mice breed on {{the surface}} of the ground in ill-constructed nests, and their young are {{certainly}} the most helpless things in nature. It is possible that where this dangerous habit exists, the parent has some admirable complex instincts to safeguard her young, in addition to the ordinary instincts of most animals of this kind. This idea was suggested to me by the action of a female mouse which I witnessed by chance. While walking in a field of stubble one day in autumn, near Buenos Ayres, I suddenly heard, issuing from near my feet, a chorus of shrill squealing voices--the familiar excessively sharp little needles of sound emitted by young, blind and naked mice, when they are disturbed or in pain. Looking down, I saw close to my foot a nest of them--there were nine in all, wriggling about and squealing; for the parent, frightened at my step, had just <b>sprung</b> from them, <b>overturning</b> in her hurry to escape the slight loosely-felted dome of fine grass and thistledown which had covered them. I saw her running away, but after going six or seven yards she stopped, and, turning partly round so as to watch me, waited in fear and trembling. I remained perfectly motionless--a sure way to allay fear and suspicion in any wild creature,--and in a few moments she returned, but with the utmost caution, frequently pausing to start and tremble, and masking her approach with corn stumps and little inequalities in the surface of the ground, until, reaching the nest, she took one of the young in her mouth, and ran rapidly away to a distance of eight or nine yards and concealed it in a tuft of dry grass.|$|R
