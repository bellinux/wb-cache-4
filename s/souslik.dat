50|$|The long-tailed ground {{squirrel}} or Eversmann's <b>souslik</b> (Urocitellus undulatus) is {{a species of}} rodent in the squirrel family Sciuridae. It is found in China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Russia.|$|E
50|$|The little ground {{squirrel}} or little <b>souslik,</b> (Spermophilus pygmaeus) is {{a species of}} rodent in the family Sciuridae. It is found mostly in Central Asia east to the Aral Sea.|$|E
5000|$|Some Eurasian {{species are}} {{sometimes}} called susliks (or <b>sousliks).</b> This {{name comes from}} Russian суслик, suslik. In some languages, a derivative of the name is in common usage, for example suseł in Polish. The scientific name of this genus means [...] "seed-lovers".|$|R
40|$|On {{the example}} of the interspecies {{relations}} of the large and small <b>sousliks,</b> the problem of natural sporadic hybridization, its reasons and evolution consequences are being considered. The detailed revision of areals of these species in the Povolzhje has been given, the chronological variations of the areals boundaries have been traced, and the causes of this process have been determined. Isolated has been the zone of the sympatry, and the existance of the interspecies hybridization of the large and small <b>sousliks</b> in the Zavolzhje has been proved. The characteristic of the hybrides and parents species with use of the complex of methods has been given the study of standard morphological signs, the colorimetric analysis of the skins paint, the electroacoustic analysis of the sound signals parameters, and the investigation of the DNA structure variation by the method of genetic fingerprints with use of the polymerase of the chain reaction with the accidental priming. The obtained results and the theoretical conclusions can be used in practical work in the system of the antiplague stations, the diagnostics of hybrides under the natural conditions, and in lecture cources by zoogeography and microevolution of mammalsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: {{currents}} through the potential-dependent Ca channels of the cardiocytes cellular membranes, hibernating and active <b>sousliks.</b> The {{purpose of the}} work: receiving and performance of the comparative analysis of the electrophysiological characteristics of the Ca-currents in cardiocytes of the sleeping and active animals. The comparative analysis of the Ca-currents of active and hibernating <b>sousliks,</b> performed for the first time, has shown, that the Ca-currentof the sleeping animals has been supressed not completely, and plaes a standard role in the conjugation of excitation and contraction. The analysis of the mathematical model of the Ca-channels of the winetr-sleeping has allowed to move forward the number of hypotheses about the mechanisms of the Ca-current supression {{in the course of}} hibernation. The number of the endogenous peptides has been studied {{from the point of view}} of its ability to modify the Caconductance. The detected compounds can serve as a source of the new pharmacological preparations. The presented results can represent an interest for electrophysiologists to be busy with the study of the ion transport, for the specialists, studying the hibernational phenomenon and dealing with the searches of the new biologically-active compounds.

5000|$|The Asia Minor ground {{squirrel}} (Spermophilus xanthoprymnus) , or Anatolian <b>souslik,</b> is {{a species of}} rodent in the family Sciuridae. It is found in Armenia, Iran, and Turkey. The scientific name roughly translates as [...] "seed-lover with yellow underparts".|$|E
50|$|The {{speckled}} {{ground squirrel}} or spotted <b>souslik</b> (Spermophilus suslicus) is {{a species of}} rodent in the family Sciuridae. Spermophilus suslicus consists of three subspecies: S. s. boristhenicus, S. s. guttatus, and S. s. suslicus. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|There are 47 {{species of}} mammals, 279 species of birds, 10 species of reptile and amphibious animals and 10 {{species of fish}} {{reported}} in the reserve. In addition more than 1000 species of invertebrates are found. Typical mammals of the steppe zone are steppe polecat (Mustela eversmanni), corsac fox (Vulpes corsac), common fox (Vulpes vulpes), Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), long-eared hedgehog (Erinaceus auritus), European hare (Lepus europaeus) and several rodent species like bobak marmot (Marmota bobac), large-toothed <b>souslik</b> (Spermophylus fulvus), red-cheeked <b>souslik</b> (Spermophylus major), little <b>souslik</b> (Spermophylus pygmeus), common hamster (Cricetus cricetus), jerboas (Allactaga major, Stylodipus telum) {{as well as several}} species of voles and lemmings. The forests are inhabited by elk (Alces alces), Tartarian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), badger (Meles meles), ermine (Mustela erminea), weasel (Mustela nivalis), pine marten (Martes martes) and raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), Blue Hare (Lepus timidus). Mainly along rivers one can also find wild boar (Sus scrofa). Among the species, which can be found occasionally in the deserts and semi deserts of the reserve is the rare saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica).|$|E
50|$|As with plants, the {{biodiversity}} {{of animals in}} the park is high. Over 2,500 species have been recorded, {{many of which are}} endemic. The park records 220 species of terrestrial vertebrates. The ungulates are typical of the Siberian taiga: Caspian deer, Siberian roe deer and moose. The carnivores include sables, Siberian weasels, and ermines. The steppe sections of the park are home to steppe polecats, long-tailed <b>sousliks</b> (a type of ground squirrel), meadow larks, and black kites. In hard-to-reach rocks and on the islands, there are rock doves and Siberian swifts. The largest mammal in the lake itself is the Baikal seal.|$|R
5|$|The least weasel feeds {{predominantly}} on mouse-like rodents, including mice, hamsters, gerbils and others. It {{usually does}} not attack adult hamsters and rats. Frogs, fish, small birds and bird eggs are rarely eaten. It {{can deal with}} adult pikas and gerbils, but usually cannot overcome brown rats and <b>sousliks.</b> Exceptional cases are known of least weasels killing prey far larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, hazel hen and hares. In England, a favoured prey item is the field vole (Microtus agrestis). These have fluctuations in population size, and in years of abundance may form up to 54% of the weasel's diet. In years of scarcity, birds form {{a greater proportion of}} the diet and female least weasels may fail to breed.|$|R

Rapid {{assessment}} of the mammalian community in the Badhyz Ecosystem, Turkmenistan, October 2014 – NINA Report 1148. 38 pp. We visited Badhyz State Nature Reserve in southern Turkmenistan {{and the surrounding area}} between 12 th and 26 th November 2014. 12 days were spent within the reserve and surrounding wildlife sanctuaries (Gyzyljar and Chemenabat wildlife sanctuaries), during which we drove 763 km and walked 68 km. In addition, we spent 3 days in the office discussing with the reserve director {{and the head of the}} science department and collating existing information from the park's records and from recent camera-trapping studies that the reserve has conducted. The objective of the expedition was to conduct a rapid {{assessment of}} the status of the populations of wild ungulates – kulan (Asiatic wild ass), urial (wild sheep), and goitered gazelle. However, because of the need to view species conservation within an ecosystem context we also collated information on community structure and the presence of the other key species that make up the Badhyz ecosystem. The Badhyz grasslands ecosystem represents a complex and relatively intact ecosystem. Our general impression is that a variety of rodents (<b>sousliks,</b> gerbils, voles, and jerboas) that exist at very high densities, supporting a large community of mammalian (red fox, wild cat), avian (raptors) and reptilian (snakes, monitor lizards) predators. Rodents may well be the dominant herbivores in this ecosystem and deserve further investigation. By comparison, the only medium sized herbivore, the Tulai hare, appears to occur only at very low densities. Our visit confirmed the presence of all of the expected large mammals. We personally saw urial (464 observations), goitered gazelle (346 observations), kulan (59 observations), wolves (5 individuals), red foxes, and wildcats along with many fresh tracks from striped hyaena and wild boar, some older leopard tracks and one observation of a set of potential caracal track. The reserve's camera trapping also provides evidence for leopards, hyaenas and wolves, kulan, gazelles, urial in addition to red foxes and wildcats. Visual observations by reserve staff also confirm the presence of caracal and honey badger. The only species missing from the ecosystem are the Asiatic cheetah, which has not been seen since the 1960 's, and the Bezoar wild goat. Among the carnivores, our observations of tracks and the reserve's records (visual and camera trapping) confirm the presence of multiple leopard individuals, including adult males and reproductive females. Striped hyaena and wolves appear to be widespread throughout the reserve and relatively abundant. Caracal, honey badger and korsac fox appear to occur at very low densities, and only in small parts of the reserve. Our own observations support the picture obtained by the reserve's censuses that the populations of gazelle and urial are large and are well distributed throughout the reserve. Although the census methodology used by the reserve does not provide statistical estimates of uncertainty, the numbers they have obtained (3700 gazelle and 1600 urial in 2013) do not seem unrealistic. We observed comparatively few kulan, and only a few fresh tracks or signs of presence such as dung. We had 59 observations, but we almost certainly saw the same individuals several times. The census methodology used by the reserve indicates a population of more than 400 kulan using the reserve in spring. Based on our extensive survey of the reserve it is almost certain that the majority of individuals must have been somewhere else (outside the reserve) at the time of our visit. © Norsk institutt for naturforskning.

50|$|The russet ground {{squirrel}} (Spermophilus major) is {{a species of}} rodent in the family Sciuridae. It {{is also known as}} the hibernating large {{ground squirrel}} and the large-toothed <b>souslik.</b> It is found in west central Asia where its natural habitat is temperate grassland.|$|E
5000|$|Big mammals of the Eurasian steppe {{were the}} Przewalski's horse, the saiga antelope, the Mongolian gazelle, the goitered gazelle, the wild Bactrian camel and the onager. The gray wolf and the corsac fox and {{occasionally}} the brown bear are predators roaming the steppe. Smaller mammal species are the Mongolian gerbil, the little <b>souslik</b> and the bobak marmot.|$|E
50|$|Biochemical studies {{indicate}} that the species diverged from the common ancestor of the European <b>souslik</b> and the Taurus ground squirrel, its closest living relatives, around five million years ago. This coincides {{with the formation of}} the Bosporus, and the subsequent separation of Anatolia from Europe, during the late Miocene. During the last Ice Age, they may have survived in small mountain refugia in the Anatolian region.|$|E
5000|$|There are two Nature Paths {{within the}} borders of the park: Lasy okolic Przemkowa (Przemkow Neighbourhood's Forests) and Ponds of Przemkow.Since 2010, the {{reintroduction}} of the European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus), or European <b>souslik</b> has been taking place in the area near Jakubowo Lubińskie as part of the bigger reintroduction of this species in the fauna of Poland led by Polish Association for Nature Preservation [...] "Salamandra".|$|E
50|$|The red-cheeked ground {{squirrel}} (Spermophilus erythrogenys) is {{a species of}} rodent in the family Sciuridae. It is {{commonly referred to as}} the red-cheeked ground <b>souslik</b> and there are several recognized subspecies. It is found in central Asia. Spermophilus brunnescens (Belyaev, 1943), Spermophilus heptneri (Vasil’eva, 1964) and Spermophilus ungae (Martino, 1923) are accepted as synonyms. There is some controversy over whether Spermophilus pallidicauda and Spermophilus brevicauda should be regarded as synonyms or full species.|$|E
50|$|The European ground {{squirrel}} (Spermophilus citellus), {{also known as}} the European <b>souslik,</b> is a species from the squirrel family, Sciuridae. It and the speckled {{ground squirrel}} (Spermophilus suslicus) are the only European representatives of the genus Spermophilus. Like all squirrels, it {{is a member of the}} rodent order. It is to be found throughout eastern Europe from southern Ukraine, to Asia Minor, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia and north as far as Poland but the range is divided in two parts by the Carpathian Mountains.|$|E
50|$|The fur is {{uniform in}} colour {{over most of}} the body, and does not have the darker {{markings}} found in neighbouring species such as the European <b>souslik.</b> Asia Minor ground squirrels are typically buff in colour, but may vary from greyish to dark brown. The underside and limbs are somewhat paler {{than the rest of the}} body, often being yellowish in colour. The only clear markings are narrow white rings around the eyes, and a white patch on the chin and throat. Females have eight or ten teats, and both sexes possess scent-producing anal glands.|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of grasslands for agriculture has triggered a serious {{decline of the}} European ground squirrel or <b>souslik</b> Spermophilus citellus, categorized as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996. The Jakupica phylogeographic lineage of central Macedonia is {{the smallest of the}} three major evolutionary lines of the European <b>souslik.</b> This lineage is an important reservoir of within-species diversity and should be regarded as an independent unit for conservation management purposes. It is endemic to Mount Jakupica, where it lives in mountain pastures at 1, 500 - 2, 250 m altitude. The total area occupied by sousliks (884 ha) is fragmented and 94 % of individuals occur in four colonies. Densities (0. 8 - 5. 5 adults ha- 1) are lower than those reported elsewhere for the species, with the total population probably, 2, 000 adults. One large colony, reportedly of c. 1, 000 sousliks, was decimated in 2007 by a catastrophic fire and had still not recovered bz 2010. A steady decline in livestock grazing, together with the predicted advance of the tree line as a consequence of climate change, will probably reduce the optimal habitat for the <b>souslik</b> and negatively affect population fitness. Monitoring needs to be implemented, at least for the largest colonies, to provide early warning of any decline...|$|E

40|$|Cryptosporidium is an {{intestinal}} protozoan parasite {{prevalent in}} a wide range of mammals. Although it has been recorded in many hosts, its impact on endangered species is poorly understood. Here we present a preliminary study of four populations of the highly threatened spotted <b>souslik</b> (Spermophilus suslicus), living in the westernmost part of the species range. The populations inhabit fragmented habitats and suffer from loss of genetic variation. An IFA test revealed that 35. 9 % of sampled animals (41 / 114) was infected with Cryptosporidium and none with Giardia. The prevalence and infection intensity differed among the populations. In areas grazed by cattle it was about 3 folds higher, which suggests a possible transmission route.
