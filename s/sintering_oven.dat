40|$|The aim {{with this}} study was to {{investigate}} the effects a change of manufacturing process would have on the mechanical properties of drill bits made of a WC/Co composite used for stone cutting. The method used today is sintering, where the material is heated in a conventional <b>sintering</b> <b>oven.</b> The other method was microwave sintering, where the material is heated by radiation in the microwave region. Also an investigation of the manufacturing cost were made. The main difference between the two heating methods is that the conventional way is a rather slow process and the microwave method is very fast. The material is also heated homogeniously in the method with mirowaves, aposed to the case with the conventional sintering where the material is heated from the outside in. This makes the material harder and more wear resistent. Another positive effect is that the pysical properties of the drill bits is easier to controll, because of the very small grain growth due to the short process time. The cost of manufacturing these drill bits by microwave sintering does not exceed the cost of the conventionall sintering...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Zirconia {{frameworks}} {{are generally}} shaded with colorant oxides {{before or after}} sintering {{in order to have}} more natural looking restorations. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of A 3, B 3 and D 3 shading on biaxial flexural strength of Cercon zirconia ceramic system. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 Ceron ceramic discs were prepared in four groups of 10. The discs were placed in a <b>sintering</b> <b>oven.</b> The first three groups were shaded into A 3, B 3 and D 3 using liquid coloring agents based on manufacturer’s instructions. The fourth group (the control group) was not shaded. The discs underwent biaxial flexural strength test in a universal testing machine after sintering. Five specimens from each group underwent EDDX (energy-dispersive x-ray analysis) for the evaluation of constituent elements. After evaluation of normal distribution of data, one-way ANOVA was applied; a post hoc Tukey test was used for two-by-two comparison of the groups (α = 0. 05). Results: Shading and its type resulted in significant differences in flexural strengths of the groups (p value < 0. 03). Disks of B 3 shade revealed the highest strength among the shaded disks, with no statistically significant differences from the control group (p value = 0. 63). Only the discs with A 3 shade exhibited significantly less flexural strengths in comparison to the unshaded discs (p value < 0. 03). Conclusion: Shading can significantly decrease flexural strength of Ceron ceramics, which should be clinically considered when Ceron zirconia cores are used; however, further studies are necessary.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} printing is an {{additive manufacturing}} technique {{that is the}} next step in the development of additive manufacturing technology. It is a tool less process which can be used to fabricate parts having complex geometries in a single step process with minimal material wastage. It involves the deposition of metal powder in successive layers followed by the selective local deposition of ink which functions as a binder using a print head. On completion of the printing process the part is cured, cleaned of loose powder and placed in an oven for debinding followed by sintering in a <b>sintering</b> <b>oven.</b> The parts so produced may then be processed as desired by techniques such as polishing to achieve the desired surface finish. In order to maintain high quality product each processing stage needs to be evaluated as a source of error. One of the most important variables in this process is the interaction between the metal powder and the ink during printing. The speed, accuracy, surface finish and yield are dependent on the quality of the powder ink interactions. The focus of this thesis is the study of powder ink interactions by controlling the characteristics of both the powder and the ink and consequently improving the quality of their interactions. This involves testing both existing metal powder ink combinations and new combinations through controlled tailoring of their properties. The combinations are assessed based on the goals of ease of processing, handling, sintering and product quality. The variables modified include particle size distribution of the powder, powder bed temperature, ink viscosity, surface tension and powder bed packing. The differences between the powder ink interactions in the case of both virgin and recycled powder are also assessed to establish better process control and improve quality...|$|E

40|$|As an {{alternative}} technology to replace lithographic process, direct printing of conductive nanofluids {{can thus be}} used to fabricate high resolution patterns, such as antennas and conductive redistribution lines. In the past few years, the use of metallic nanoparticles has undergone major development in microelectronics thanks to sintering achievements. To preserve electronic components functionalities, thermal budget need to be carefully considered, and thus a limited sintering temperature below 300 °C should be used when printing nanoparticles. Nonetheless, {{the absence of any}} compacting step requires an exploration of novel sintering approaches to achieve a sufficient coalescence. In this frame, several <b>sintering</b> processes (thermal <b>oven,</b> rapid thermal annealing, selective microwave and laser curing) have been investigated to optimize the annealing of those thin films. The aim of this work is to analyze the induced microstructure of the above-mentioned sintering processes, and to determine how electrical and mechanical characteristics are consequently impacted. According the sintering technique and process parameters, an average grain size up to one micron can been achieved from initial mean particle size of 40 nm, without exceeding a temperature range of 300 °C. The microstructure characterization has been performed using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) in a field emission gun scanning electron microscope. Microstructural evolution of various sintered inkjet-printed films has thus been correlated with electrical resistivity and with the Young's modulus determined by nanoindentation. A strong link between those three parameters was highlighted during experiments giving credit to either a surface or a fully volumetric sintering, according the process. Sintering is then mainly triggered respectively by surface mass transfer or by grain boundary diffusion. Particular interests are shown for selective sintering especially when using microwaves and laser. Silver thin-films with an electrical resistivity three times higher than the bulk can be reached in a few minutes for a Young's modulus of about 50 GPa. In the meantime, the convective rapid thermal processing exhibits a various electrical resistivity and grain size. A Young's modulus even close to the bulk can be obtained when using a fast temperature ramp at 150 °C/sec for 15 minutes. This microstructural tailoring of printed silver nanoparticles were successfully implemented in the post-process step to achieve 600 nm thick films with very low resistivity and improved mechanical stiffness...|$|R

40|$|A new {{manufacturing}} paradigm may {{lower the}} cost and environmental impact of existing products, as well as enable completely new products. Large scale, roll-to-roll manufacturing of flexible electronics and other functionality has great potential. However, a commercial breakthrough depends on a lower consumption of materials and energy compared with competing alternatives, and that sufficiently high performance and reliability of the products can be maintained. The substrate constitutes {{a large part of}} the product, and therefore its cost and environmental sustainability are important. Electrically conducting thin films are required in many functional devices and applications. In demanding applications, metal films offer the highest conductivity.   In this thesis, paper substrates of various type and construction were characterized, and the characteristics were related to the performance of inkjet-printed metal patterns. Fast absorption of the ink carrier was beneficial for well-defined pattern geometry, as well as high conductivity. Surface roughness with topography variations of sufficiently large amplitude and frequency, was detrimental to the pattern definition and conductivity. Porosity was another important factor, where the characteristic pore size was much more important than the total pore volume. Apparent surface energy was important for non-absorbing substrates, but of limited importance for coatings with a high absorption rate. Applying thin polymer–based coatings on flexible non-porous films to provide a mechanism for ink solvent removal, improved the pattern definition significantly. Inkjet-printing of a ZnO-dispersion on uncoated paper provided a thin spot-coating, allowing conductivity of silver nanoparticle films. Conductive nanoparticle films could not form directly on the uncoated paper.   The resulting performance of printed metal patterns was highly dependent on a well adapted sintering methodology. Several sintering methods were examined in this thesis, including conventional <b>oven</b> <b>sintering,</b> electrical sintering, microwave sintering, chemical sintering and intense pulsed light sintering. Specially designed coated papers with modified chemical and physical properties, were utilized for chemical low-temperature sintering of silver nanoparticle inks. For intense pulsed light sintering and material conversion of patterns, custom equipment was designed and built. Using the equipment, inkjet-printed copper oxide patterns were processed into highly conducting copper patterns. Custom-designed papers with mesoporous coatings and porous precoatings improved the reliablility and performance of the reduction and sintering process.         The thesis aims to clarify how ink-substrate interactions and sintering methodology affect the performance and reliability of inkjet-printed nanoparticle patterns on flexible substrates. This improves the selection, adaptation, design and manufacturing of suitable substrates for inkjet-printed high conductivity patterns, such as circuit boards or RFID antennas. ...|$|R

No entanto, observaram-se perdas menores por correntes parasitas em decorrência do aumento da resistividade pela adição de fósforo, silício e níquel nas ligas de ferro. Nas simulações de uma máquina elétrica rotativa com ímãs permanentes, especificamente, de um servomotor comparou-se os resultados entre os núcleos de chapas laminadas e os de materiais ferromagnéticos em blocos únicos, com a utilização do software FEMM 4. 2 (Finite Element Method Magnetics). Os resultados da liga Fe 1 %P apresentaram valores próximos de torque e densidade de fluxo em relação aos dos tradicionais núcleos de chapas laminadas. Nos ensaios de perdas magnéticas em núcleos, na forma de um transformador, observou-se que em frequências baixas o material sinterizado apresentou perdas significativas, já em frequências elevadas comportou-se de forma similar aos núcleos de chapas. Desta maneira, demonstrou-se que os materiais estudados podem se constituir em alternativa viável para a construção de núcleos de Máquinas Elétricas Rotativas de aplicação especial, como servomotores, motores de alta velocidade e minimotores. The {{purpose of}} this work is to study the properties of ferromagnetic alloys obtained by Powder Metallurgy to construct cores of Rotary Electric Machines, usually mounted on rolled steel sheets. To perform these activities, iron power and their alloys obtained by a mixture with different percentages of phosphorus (1, 2 and 3 %), silicon (1, 3 and 5 %) and nickel (50 %) were used. The powders were compacted in dies and then the test specimens were <b>sintered</b> in an <b>oven</b> at controlled temperatures When the material was characterized, histeresis curves were traced, which present magnetic properties inferior {{to those of the}} sheet cores. However, smaller losses were observed from parasite currents as a result of resistivity increased by adding phosphorus, silicon and nickel to the iron alloys. In simulations of a rotary electric machine with permanent magnets, specifically belonging to a servomotor, the results were compared between the cores of rolled sheets and those of ferromagnetic materials in single blocks, using FEMM 4. 2 (Finite Element Method Magnetics) software. The results of the alloy Fe 1 %P presented some values close to torque and flow density as related to the traditional cores of rolled sheets. In the trials on magnetic losses in cores, {{in the form of a}} transformer, it was observed that at low frequencies the sintered material presented significant losses. On the other hand, at high frequencies it behaved similarly to the sheet cores. It was thus demonstrated that the materials studied can constitute a viable alternative to construct cores of Rotary Electric Machines for special application, such as servomotors, high velocity motors and minimotors...|$|R
40|$|Conductive inks have {{received}} increasing attention over {{past few decades}} owing to their applications for printed devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), circuit, flexible displays, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, and photovoltaics. Because of the lowest resistivity and anti-oxidation properties in air, silver inks are the currently favored conductive inks for printed electronics. However, the high cost and low electro-migration resistance of silver inks which can cause circuit failure under high humidity, limit their applications on a large scale. Copper, owing to its low cost, low resistivity (1. 7 × 10 - 8 Ω m, {{similar to that of}} silver) and high electro-migration resistance, has become the promising material for conductive inks. However, copper particles suffer from the oxidation. This problem can be solved by stabilizing copper particles by surfactants. The stabilizers which act as barriers hinder the percolation paths of electrons, resulting in low conductivity (high resistivity) of the printed patterns. A conventional method to overcome the above obstacle is high temperature <b>sintering</b> in an <b>oven</b> (> 250 ℃). Nevertheless, for applications of low-cost and flexible electronic devices on heat-sensitive substrates, a low sintering temperature is essential. To decrease sintering temperature, several methods, such as laser process, decreasing particle size, photonic sintering, and using copper-based metal-organic decomposition (MOD), have been reported. In this thesis, new strategies to obtain highly conductive copper layers by lower temperature (≤ 200 °C) sintering were put forward. This thesis contains 5 chapters. First chapter is Introduction. Recent progress of low temperature sintering for electro conductive layers is discussed. In addition, the strategies and methods of the research in this thesis are outlined. In the second chapter, alkylamine-stabilized copper fine particles and their inks were prepared. One common way to lower the sintering temperature is decreasing particle size (100 nm). In the first step, copper fine particles (280 nm) were synthesized by a one-pot reaction utilizing D-isoascorbic acid as a mild reductant. For sintering processes, an oxidative preheating of the film was used for the formation of tight connections between particles. Then a following reductive sintering using a 3 % hydrogen in nitrogen gas at 200 °C and 250 °C enabled the achieving of high conductivities of copper films. The results showed that the thermal-preheating step in air generated convex surfaces, nanorods or nanoparticles among particles successfully. This was owed to the inside-out diffusion of copper ions from copper particles and the diffusion of oxygen ion in the opposite direction. The generated convex surfaces, nanorods or nanoparticles increased the contacts between particles and thus facilitated the sintering of particles in the following reductive sintering process. As a result, resistivities of 12. 2 × 10 - 8 and 7. 8 × 10 - 8 Ω m of copper films were achieved at 200 °C and 250 °C, respectively. In the third chapter, low temperature deposition of metallic copper from metal-organic compound systems is discussed. To achieve low resistivity at a lower sintering temperature, copper-based MOD inks with scalability and simplicity were also studied. In this work, the influence of various copper sources (i. e., copper(II) formate tetrahydrate and copper(II) acetate monohydrate) in MOD inks on the resistivity of films was compared. Commercially available copper particles (0. 4 - 2. 5 μm) were introduced into the inks to replace the organic components for higher conductivity and reliability of the obtained copper films. The results demonstrated that the resistivity of sintered copper films decreased with the decrease of size of the added commercial particles. The lowest resistivity of 2. 6 × 10 - 7 Ω m was achieved using the inks containing 0. 4 μm of added copper particles after sintering at 120 °C under nitrogen. In addition, polyvinylpyrrolidone stabilized copper particles (PVP-Cu) with a size range of 127 ± 20 nm instead of the commercial ones were used for preparing MOD inks to demonstrate the general applicability of this method. The resistivity of the obtained copper film using PVP-Cu particles at the sintering temperature of 100 °C was 7 × 10 - 6 Ω m. These results demonstrated that the use of copper particles to replace organic components in MOD inks effectively led to the low resistivity of film after sintering at the temperature as low as 100 °C under nitrogen. In the forth chapter, in order to further decrease the resistivity, polydispersed-submicron copper particles stabilized with decomposable polymer (polypropylene carbonate, PPC) as a main part and a self-reducible copper formate/ 1 -amino- 2 -propanol (CuF-IPA) complex as an additive were chosen to prepare the MOD inks. The surface modification of copper particles with PPC, using of smaller poly-dispersed particles, and self-reducible copper complex were favorable to obtaining highly conductive copper films at low temperature sintering. The lowest reported resistivity (8. 8 × 10 - 7 Ω m) at the sintering temperature of 100 °C under nitrogen was achieved. Such a low sintering temperature with low resistivity was proved to be a result of the dual promotion effects of aminolysis of PPC with IPA and the pyrolysis of CuF-IPA complex. PPC broke down into smaller molecules by aminolysis with IPA, which reduced the steric stabilization for copper particles, and thus enabled particle coalescence and sintering more easily. The generated copper particles from the pyrolysis of CuF-IPA complex directly contributed for creating connections among particles and higher packing density. The fifth chapter contains conclusions of this thesis. The methods and conductive inks developed in our study are promising for flexible and low-cost printing electronic devices...|$|R
