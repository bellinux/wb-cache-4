Many used iPhones are resold in countries where new ones are more expensive. Sellers can fill out an online form to describe the used products they want to sell, then get a quote through the website. After receiving the quote, sellers have thirty days to ship the product using a pre-paid <b>shipping</b> <b>label</b> provided by NextWorth. The company wipes the device's memory and inspects the item before sending the seller reimbursement in 3-15 days depending on the payment method. If NextWorth appraises a product at a lower condition than the seller expected, they can get an explanation from NextWorth, challenge the quote, or reject it and get the product back.|$|E

2500|$|Shipping labels: Often {{found on}} the back of {{millwork}} like baseboard molding or door and window trim, <b>shipping</b> <b>labels</b> associated with Sears may indicate that the home is a Sears Catalog house. Most of the millwork was fulfilled by the Sears-owned [...] "Norwood Sash and Door Company" [...] of Cincinnati, Ohio. However, building materials like millwork could be purchased separately from Sears so millwork with <b>shipping</b> <b>labels</b> is not, by itself, a definitive indicator of a Sears Catalog house.|$|R

50|$|Gallery East’s logo since 1979 {{has been}} a {{pointing}} index finger. Because of the Gallery’s sometimes association with Dada and the prevalent use of the pointing index finger by Dada artists, some have conjectured that the Gallery East logo was lifted, thereby identifying it with that particular anti-art movement. However, it was a pure coincidence. The deco-style pointing index finger was from a <b>shipping</b> <b>label</b> used on freight boxes and {{was found in a}} desk when the gallery moved into the 24 East Street location.|$|E
50|$|A {{checkweigher}} {{can be used}} {{to count}} packs, and the aggregate (total) weight of the boxes going onto a pallet for shipment, including the ability to read each package's weight and cubic dimensions. The controller computer can print a <b>shipping</b> <b>label</b> and a bar-code label to identify the weight, the cubic dimensions, ship-to address, and other data for machine ID through the shipment of the product. A receiving checkweigher for the shipment can read the label with a bar code scanner, and determine if the shipment is as it was before the transportation carrier received it from the shipper's loading dock, and determine if a box is missing, or something was pilfered or broken in transit.|$|E
50|$|Many {{companies}} {{purchase and}} recycle all brands of working and broken laptops and notebook computers from individuals and corporations. Building {{a market for}} recycling of desktop computers has proven more difficult than exchange programs for laptops, smartphones and other smaller electronics. A basic business model {{is to provide a}} seller an instant online quote based on laptop characteristics, then to send a <b>shipping</b> <b>label</b> and prepaid box to the seller, to erase, reformat, and process the laptop, and to pay rapidly by cheque. A majority of these companies are also generalized electronic waste recyclers as well; organizations that recycle computers exclusively include Cash For Laptops, a laptop refurbisher in Nevada that claims {{to be the first to}} buy laptops online, in 2001.|$|E

Radomski recalled that he engaged in four to five “small transactions” with Lansing. Radomski said that Lansing was familiar with testosterone and “knew exactly what he wanted.” Radomski produced two $1,000 money orders from Lansing, retrieved from his bank, made payable to Radomski; both were dated February 5, 2002... Radomski stated that this payment was for testosterone and one kit of human growth hormone. During the search of Radomski’s residence, an undated, partial <b>shipping</b> <b>label</b> was seized with Lansing’s name on it and a Colorado address. We have confirmed that Lansing resided at this address when he played with the Rockies. Lansing’s name, with an address and two telephone numbers, is listed in the address book seized from Radomski’s residence by federal agents." ...|$|E
50|$|Pick {{and pack}} {{is a part}} of a {{complete}} supply chain management process that is commonly used in the retail distribution of goods. It entails processing small to large quantities of product, often truck or train loads and disassembling them, picking the relevant product for each destination and re-packaging with <b>shipping</b> <b>label</b> affixed and invoice included. Usual service includes obtaining a fair rate of shipping from common as well as expediting truck carriers.Pick and Pack services are offered by many businesses that specialize in supply chain management solutions.Case picking is the gathering of full cartons or boxes of product. This is often done on a pallet. In the consumer products industry, case picking large quantities of cartons is often an entry level employee's task. There is, however, significant skill required to make a good pallet load of product. Key requirements are that cartons not be damaged, they make good use of the available cube (space) and be quick to assemble.|$|E

Modern {{receiving}} operations {{rarely have}} time to break down a shipping unit (carton or pallet) and identify its components, depending instead on quick scans of barcodes on <b>shipping</b> <b>labels.</b> An ASN can provide {{a list of all}} of the barcoded ID numbers of the shipping units and the contents of each. Receiving costs are thought to be reduced by about 40%.|$|R

5000|$|The program's {{team was}} {{also able to}} visit the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, where they {{discovered}} the original interior design drawings for Le Grand Teddy, showing how the paintings would have been placed. An investigation of the provenance traced the ownership back from Tutt, through Robert Warren and a previous owner, to British theatrical manager Charles Cochran. The program's art historian Bendor Grosvenor was able to locate an article in Windsor Magazine, from 1933, which specifically mentioned both The Café and The Oysters as being in Cochran's possession at the time. Following the clue provided by a damaged <b>shipping</b> <b>label</b> {{on the back of}} The Café, the program was finally able to locate contemporary Dutch newspaper reviews from 1926, which described both paintings in great detail, and thus confirming that after the Grand Teddy had closed, Vuillard's dealer Jos Hessel had placed the two smaller paintings in an exhibition in the Netherlands, from where they were thought to have been seen and purchased by Cochran.|$|E
5000|$|Where the {{research}} is proceeding backwards, to discover the previous provenance of a painting whose current ownership and location is known, {{it is important to}} record the physical details of the painting - style, subject, signature, materials, dimensions, frame, etc. [...] The titles of paintings and the attribution to a particular artist may change over time. The size of the work and its description can be used to identify earlier references to the painting. The back of a painting can contain significant provenance information. There may be exhibition marks, dealer stamps, gallery labels and other indications of previous ownership. There may also be shipping labels. In the BBC TV programme Fake or Fortune? the provenance of the painting Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil was investigated using a gallery sticker and <b>shipping</b> <b>label</b> on the back. Early provenance can sometimes be indicated by a cartellino added to a painting in a collection. However these can be forged and can become faded or be painted over.|$|E
