5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle <b>slowly</b> <b>around</b> the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Force India {{committed}} {{an error}} when bringing their drivers in early. Liuzzi {{made contact with}} Sutil which damaged his front wing. The team had been expecting Liuzzi to pit before Sutil, but the latter {{was the first to}} arrive into the team's pit stall. It was only after both drivers had returned to the circuit that the team realised they had accidentally placed Liuzzi's tyres on Sutil's car and Sutil's tyres on Liuzzi's. Buemi was pushed back into his garage and became the race's first retirement with accident damage on the second lap. Hamilton was running close behind Vettel but despite his car's straight-line speed advantage, he was unable to affect an overtaking manoeuvre. Hamilton later dropped further away from Vettel. Trulli became afflicted with an gearbox issue which meant he was unable to select second gear, and his mechanics pushed his Lotus T127 back into his garage where they attempted to rectify the issue without success. Alonso recorded lap times faster than teammate Massa which reduced the gap to 1.1 seconds by the conclusion of lap six. Trulli was released from his garage by his team but drove <b>slowly</b> <b>around</b> the circuit and elected to retire on the next lap.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to lunisolar precession, {{the actions of}} the other planets of the Solar System cause the whole ecliptic to rotate <b>slowly</b> <b>around</b> an axis which has an ecliptic longitude of about 174° measured on the instantaneous ecliptic.

The sum of the two precessions is known as the general precession.|$|E
25|$|Hughesville {{is named}} for Jeptha Hughes, who {{purchased}} land from John Heap in 1816 and laid out the town of Hughesburg. Hughes sold the entire plot in 1820 to Daniel Harrold.

The first doctor in Hughesville, John W. Peale, arrived in 1828. Hughesville was incorporated as a borough on April 23, 1852. The first dentist opened an office in 1853 and the first lawyer settled in Hughesville in 1875.|$|E
500|$|In 1772, Italian-born {{mathematician}} Joseph-Louis Lagrange, {{in studying}} the restricted three-body problem, predicted that a small body sharing an orbit with a planet but lying 60° ahead or behind it will be trapped near these points.

500|$|Newtonian gravity {{predicts that}} the orbit which a single planet traces around a {{perfectly}} spherical star should be an ellipse. Einstein's theory predicts a more complicated curve: the planet behaves {{as if it were}} travelling around an ellipse, but at the same time, the ellipse as a whole is rotating <b>slowly</b> <b>around</b> the star. In the diagram on the right, the ellipse predicted by Newtonian gravity is shown in red, and part of the orbit predicted by Einstein in blue. For a planet orbiting the Sun, this deviation from Newton's orbits is known as the anomalous perihelion shift. [...] The first measurement of this effect, for the planet Mercury, dates back to 1859. The most accurate results for Mercury and for other planets to date are based on measurements which were undertaken between 1966 and 1990, using radio telescopes. [...] General relativity predicts the correct anomalous perihelion shift for all planets where this can be measured accurately (Mercury, Venus and the Earth).|$|E
500|$|On April4, Odille began redeveloping {{convection}} and re-intensified into {{a moderate}} tropical storm, after entering {{an area of}} more favorable conditions. Around that time, it began moving to the southwest due to a break between the ridge. On April10, Odille intensified into a tropical cyclone while moving <b>slowly</b> <b>around</b> a ridge. The next day, it intensified into an intense tropical cyclone while passing near St. Brandon and turning to the southeast due to an approaching trough. Odille developed a well-defined eye [...] in diameter, and MFR estimated peak winds of 175km/h (110mph), while the JTWC estimated winds of 195km/h (120mph). On April12, the cyclone passed about 150km (95mi) west of Rodrigues, where wind gusts reached [...] at Port Mathurin. Steady weakening occurred as Odille accelerated and experienced increasing shear, weakening below tropical cyclone status on April13. The next day, the storm became extratropical, which lasted three more days until it was absorbed by the cold front.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, Jens Naumann, also blinded in adulthood, {{became the}} first in a series of 16 paying {{patients}} to receive Dobelle’s second generation implant, marking one of the earliest commercial uses of BCIs. The second generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into coherent vision.

2500|$|While {{the heights}} of the various SkyScreamer {{installations}} vary from park to park, the basic operation of the ride is consistent. Riders sit in one of 16 two-seat chairs connected to a gondola mounted on a central tower, which brings the gondola up and down. A seat belt is placed over the rider's waist to keep them firmly in their seat, and a lap bar is fastened into place. When the ride cycle begins, the gondola rises {{to the top of}} the tower, beginning to spin <b>slowly</b> <b>around</b> the central tower and picking up speed as it ascends further. By the time it reaches the top, it is rotating around the tower at its full speed of approximately , with riders rotating around the tower in a circle [...] in diameter. The gondola remains at the top of the tower for a period of time, then it descends and slows down slightly before returning to the top. At the end of the cycle, the gondola lowers to the ground and slows its rotation such that, by the time it reaches the bottom of the tower, all rotation has ceased and the riders are able to depart. Optionally, SkyScreamer can be set to rotate in the opposite direction during its cycle, such that riders are traveling backwards. Thus far, the installations at St. Louis, Discovery Kingdom, Fiesta Texas, New England and La Ronde have operated in this manner, with each running them in this mode during special events or as a limited-time promotion.|$|E
