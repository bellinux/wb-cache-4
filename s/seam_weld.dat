40|$|Purpose: Seam welds {{occur during}} the hollow profile extrusion; the billet’s {{material}} {{is divided into}} separate metal streams by the bridges of the die which support a mandrel, and then these metal streams are welded in welding chamber behind the bridges. When the desired conditions have not been provided, the required quality in seam welds may not occur. One of the possible reasons for this situation is a poor metal feed. In this study, an insufficient pressure problem occurring in seam welds on an aluminum extrusion profile section is investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The study was realized on a hollow extrusion profile type which has <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> zones. The experimental profile was produced by a real extrusion press which has a capacity of 1460 tones. Findings: The poor metal feed occurring on specimen is shown by microstructural pictures. Microstructure of the main region has a homogenous appearance. In the microstructure, containing <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> region, only a slight change was observed in <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> region. However, {{there was no significant}} change in near of <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> regions. This points out that there has been no metallurgical problem.

It describes the <b>seam</b> <b>welding</b> of multi-layered similar and dissimilar metallic sheets. The method described and involved advancing a rotating non-consumable rod (CP Mo or AISI 304) toward the upper sheet of a metallic stack clamped under pressure. As soon as the distal end of the rod touched the top portion of the upper metallic sheet, an axial force was applied. After an initial dwell time, the metallic stack moved horizontally relative to the stationery non-consumable rod by a desired length, thereby forming a metallurgical bond between the metallic sheets. Multi-track and multi-metal <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> of high temperature metallic sheets, AISI 304, C-Mn steel, Nickel-based alloys, Cp Cu, Ti 6 Al 4 V and low temperature metallic sheets, AA 6061 were obtained.

Tensile- shear testing showed that the <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> of AISI 304, C-Mn steel, Nickel-based alloy were stronger than the starting base metal counterparts while AA 6061 was weaker due to softening.

Design/methodology/approach: Producing extrusion profile has been performed by a press, which has a capacity of 1460 tones, in a real producing and carried out by changing the exit temperature and ram speed, which are the important parameters. Exit temperature TE, is chosen as 440, 475, 500, 520 and 560 °C. Extrusion speed is also taken {{in the base of}} ram speed VR, and production is carried out at the speeds of 2, 4, 6, 10 and 15 mm/s. Therefore the effects of extrusion parameters on macrostructure properties have been investigated. Findings: It is seen clearly that some differences are occurred from the viewpoint of structural features between the regions, when the experimental results are observed without regarding the extrusion parameters. In addition, it was observed commonly the structure of the material had a change through re-crystallization with increasing temperatures. This situation decreases the significance of <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> regions. But insignificancy of <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> region is designed as possible as can be from the viewpoint of decorative.

40|$|A {{sign for}} the ageing of a gas {{transmission}} network {{is the fact that}} through ILI inspection corrosion is detected. Mostly the detected corrosion is hereby concentrated around the girth weld. Usually {{this is due to the}} fact that girth weld coatings are applied in the field in less optimal conditions than coatings applied on the pipes in the mill. In some cases the corrosion even overlaps with the girth or longitudinal weld. For the assessment of these reference is made to more recent editions of ASME B 31 G- 2009 and later, in which the application of standard pipe body corrosion assessment methods (original B 31 G, modified B 31 G and RSTRENG) to corrosion associated with a weld is allowed, provided certain criteria are met: The welds are of sound quality, The welds have ductile characteristics, The welds are free of workmanship defects in close proximity to interact with the area of corrosion. The majority of gas and oil pipelines are over 40 -years old. Original construction records for these early pipelines are not always complete, or available, hence confirming whether the above criteria have been satisfied can be a challenge. The majority of research to date regarding the assessment of corrosion has primarily focused on damage associated with the pipe body. In contrast, there has only been limited research undertaken towards evaluating corrosion associated with either a girth or long <b>seam</b> <b>weld.</b> A limited number of tests have been undertaken over the years, the results of which were used by Rosenfeld (Kiefner & Associates) in 1996 to provide guidelines for assessing the serviceability of corroded girth welds, and Leis (Battelle) in 2004 to provide metrics to enable the use of flow stress criteria for the assessment of corrosion associated with a girth or long <b>seam</b> <b>weld.</b> Use of the guidelines requires knowledge of the material toughness which is not always available, particularly for older pipelines. Consequently, the EPRG requested DNV GL to conduct an up-to-date review of research undertaken towards understanding the integrity of pipelines with corrosion associated with a girth or long <b>seam</b> <b>weld,</b> with an emphasis on pipelines constructed in the 1960 s and 1970 s. Outcome of this research review suggest that corrosion up to 20 % deep in either a girth or long <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> will be collapse dominated, regardless of toughness, at temperatures as low as - 20 °C. From this follows that provided the weld is inspected and confirmed free of coincidental defects, corrosion up to 20 % of the thickness affecting a girth or long <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> will be acceptable, without the need for formal assessment...|$|E
40|$|Human and Systems EngineeringLaser welding is an {{emerging}} joining technique for automotive industry. Due {{to the complex}} process, the control of laser welding quality problem such as spatter, porosity, and undercut is not easy. Traditional mechanical testing of weld is time consuming, costly, and inefficient for on-line monitoring of laser welding quality. In this regards, this thesis aims to estimate the laser welding quality in a non-destructive way by using the geometry of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> of weldment. The most challenging task which is covered in this thesis is the estimation of the tensile shear strength in a non-destructive way. Experimental analysis reveals {{that the existence of}} two types of correlation in the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and tensile shear strength in the laser welding of galvanized steel: (1) positive correlation exists between the log-transformed average width of the top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength, and (2) negative correlation exists between the variation of the width of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength. These correlations exist only when top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> having non uniform <b>seam</b> boundary. However, <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> having uniform seam boundary do not have sufficient evidence of the correlation between the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and tensile shear strength.

40|$|Longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. The formation of longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> {{is a solid}} bonding process, controlled by the local conditions in the extrusion die. Being the weakest areas within the extrusion cross section, it is desirable to achieve adequate properties of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams.</b> In our research, {{the concept of a}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator as a means of quantifying bonding efficiency is introduced. The value of this indicator depends on a number of factors: the material flow within the die weld chambers, an adequate pressure level acting on the weld planes and finally the evolution of the metal microstructure. Optimisation of the welding conditions leads to a higher value of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator and thus to improved <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> properties. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to assess the feasibility of this concept. In lab-scale experiments, AA 6060 and AA 6082 aluminium alloy billets were formed into strips by means of the direct hot extrusion process. By utilising porthole dies a central longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> is formed. The effect of different geometries of the weld chamber and the processing conditions {{on the quality of the}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> are investigated. Characterisation of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> through mechanical testing, focusing on the ability of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> area to accommodate plastic deformation following the onset of plastic instability, and microstructural analysis provides insight into bonding performance. The outcome of this characterisation provides a basis for an estimation of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> indicator. Through computer modelling, the particular process conditions related to <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation are calculated and correlated with the experimental results. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation is controlled by a combination of factors as described above.
