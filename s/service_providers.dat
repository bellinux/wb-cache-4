30|$|The {{issue of}} secure {{outsourcing}} of data has been addressed in several recent papers. Hacigümüs et al. [17] {{were the first}} to formally propose database services outsourcing to a third-party <b>service</b> <b>provider.</b> The typical model comprises of the data owner, <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> and authorized users. The data owner outsources data and query services to the untrusted <b>service</b> <b>provider.</b> In Location-based <b>services,</b> trusted users issue queries to the <b>service</b> <b>provider.</b> Despite the fact that the cloud environment provides on-demand services along with scalable storage and extensive computational power, it poses data security and privacy challenges. The primary goal is to secure data by encrypting it and allowing queries on encrypted spatial data at the cloud <b>service</b> <b>provider.</b> Batten et al. [18] propose a cloud storage model, which comprises of cloud customers, cloud <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> and cloud <b>service</b> operator. The customer rents storage from the <b>service</b> <b>provider,</b> which owns the cloud resources and maximizes storage resource utilization between numerous customers, and the management of data storage is taken care of by the service operator.|$|R
