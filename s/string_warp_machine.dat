In past few years there has been interest in investigating perturbative [1] and nonperturbative <b>string</b> <b>warped</b> compactifications [2, 3, 4, 5]. One of the attractive features of such compactifications is the appearance of a scalar potential in the effective low dimensional effective action depending on some of moduli fields. This leads to the lifting of some of the flat directions of the associated compactifications without a warp factor. The presence of the potential can be understood in various ways. One way is that in warped compactifications some ten- or eleven-dimensional supergravity form field strengths receive an expectation value. Therefore one can view the presence of the potentials as a consequence of a Scherk-Schwarz type of mechanism. Another feature of these warpe...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to evince the {{corrections}} {{on the black}} <b>string</b> <b>warped</b> horizon in the braneworld paradigm, and their drastic physical consequences, {{as well as to}} provide subsequent applications in astrophysics. Our analysis concerning black holes on the brane departs from the Schwarzschild case, where the black string is unstable to large-scale perturbation. The cognizable measurability of the black string horizon corrections due to braneworld effects is investigated, as well as their applications in the variation of quasars luminosity. We delve into the case wherein two solutions of Einstein's equations proposed by Casadio, Fabbri, and Mazzacurati, regarding black hole metrics presenting a post-Newtonian parameter measured on the brane. In this scenario, it is possible to analyze purely the braneworld corrected variation in quasars luminosity, by an appropriate choice of the post-Newtonian parameter that precludes Hawking radiation on the brane: the variation in quasars luminosity is uniquely provided by pure braneworld effects, as the Hawking radiation on the brane is suppressed.
