5|$|At King Edward's death, {{only the}} royal estates and the estates of Harold were larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand. Medieval writers {{condemned}} {{him for his}} greed and for his pluralism. Hugh the Chanter, a medieval chronicler, claimed that the confiscated wealth of Stigand helped keep King William on the throne. A recent study of his wealth {{and how it was}} earned shows that while he did engage in some exploitative methods to gain some of his wealth, other lands were gained through inheritance or through royal favour. The same study shows little evidence that he despoiled his episcopal estates, although the record towards monastic houses is more <b>suspect.</b> <b>There</b> is no complaint in contemporary records about his private life, and the accusations that he committed simony and was illiterate only date from the 12th century.|$|E
25|$|Because she was {{a murderer}} alive {{at the time of}} the Jack the Ripper killings, some have {{suggested}} that Dyer was Jack the Ripper, who killed the prostitutes through botched abortions. This suggestion was put forward by author William Stewart, although he preferred Mary Pearcey as his chosen <b>suspect.</b> <b>There</b> is, however, no evidence to connect Dyer to the Jack the Ripper murders.|$|E
500|$|On September 27, 2011, Denali National Park ranger Brandon Latham {{arrived to}} assist four climbers {{belonging}} to a [...] "difficult access" [...] team from Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates. The reason for the inspection was the park agency's suspicion {{that there were more}} cracks on the monument's upper section not visible from the inside. The agency said it filled the cracks that occurred on August 23. After Hurricane Irene hit the area on August 27, water was discovered inside the memorial, leading the Park Service to <b>suspect</b> <b>there</b> was more undiscovered damage. The rappellers used radios to report what they found to engineering experts on the ground. Wiss, Janney, Elstner climber Dave Megerle took three hours to set up the rappelling equipment and set up a barrier around the monument's lightning rod system atop the pyramidion; {{it was the first time}} the hatch in the pyramidion had been open since 2000.|$|E

2500|$|... (quotation {{referring}} to Jan Karski and Felix Frankfurter: When Jan Karski disclosed {{the message of}} Nazis' slaughtering of the Jews, the U.S. Supreme Court judge Felix Frankfurter's response to a Polish diplomat was, [...] "Mr. Ambassador, I did not say this young man is lying. I said I am unable to believe him. There is a difference.") [...] Harry Wu's quote, is anecdotal and its accuracy is <b>suspect.</b> <b>There</b> is, however, no substantive {{difference between the two}} quotations, the one cited above and the filmed interview given by Karski himself in 1978.|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut (guest star season 2, main cast season 3–5: part 1)– {{works for}} Gus as an {{all-purpose}} cleaner and hitman, and also works for Saul {{as a private}} investigator. The character of Mike {{has been compared to}} Harvey Keitel's Winston Wolf character in Pulp Fiction, which Banks says he is not trying to emulate: [...] "I immediately tried to put it out of my mind, quite honestly. His cleaner ain't my cleaner. But throughout this world, you would <b>suspect</b> <b>there</b> had been a great many cleaners, whether government-run or individual contractors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moments {{after the}} shooting, a {{neighborhood}} resident {{who had heard}} the gunshots was rounding the corner onto Voskerichian's street. He nearly collided with a person whom he described as a short, husky boy, 16 to 18 years old and clean-shaven, wearing a sweater and watch cap, who was sprinting away from the crime scene. The neighbor said that the youth pulled the cap over his face and said, [...] "Oh, Jesus!" [...] as he sprinted by. Other neighbors claimed to have seen the [...] "teenager", as well as another person matching Berkowitz's description, loitering separately {{in the area for}} about an hour before the shooting. During the following days, the media repeated police claims that this [...] "chubby teenager" [...] was the <b>suspect.</b> <b>There</b> were no direct witnesses to the Voskerichian murder.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, the {{decision}} to demolish the Anglican Cathedral has caused great controversy. One commentator has asked why there is [...] "relative silence {{over the future of}} the Basilica for the Catholics who are allowed to get on with their decision-making processes in relative peace, while the Anglicans have to fight it out in the streets and letters to the editor pages of The Press? I <b>suspect</b> <b>there</b> remains in Christchurch the notion of old that the Catholics are still regarded as peripheral, parked over {{on the edge of town}} in an area back in the day that was next to the gas works that turned the cathedral a nicotine yellow. Now the distance from the heart of the city seems to have at last paid off as the Basilica's counterpart in the Square can't get out of the ring".|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Frederick ran for Chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia (RPV) {{against the}} will of the state's Republican establishment. [...] Frederick {{challenged}} former Lt. Governor John H. Hager, the incumbent chairman and father of Henry Hager, son-in-law to President George W. Bush. [...] He won the Chairmanship in a May 31, 2008 state convention, capturing a rumored 60% of the vote, with the actual figure being unknown due to Hager appearing on the convention stage and requesting Frederick be elected by acclamation. [...] The following year, he was removed from the position by the party's central governing body, after a series of disputed allegations characterized as [...] "a thin case that one can only <b>suspect</b> <b>there</b> were other motives behind Frederick’s demise." [...] It was proposed that Frederick's election and later removal represented a conflict within the party between insiders and outsiders (or grassroots versus establishment). [...] After his removal, Frederick considered seeking the chairman job again at the party's 2009 convention, but later declined.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{provisions}} {{allowed for}} the disclosure of electronic communications to law enforcement agencies. Those who operate or own a [...] "protected computer" [...] can give permission for authorities to intercept communications carried out on the machine, thus bypassing {{the requirements of the}} Wiretap statute. The definition of a [...] "protected computer" [...] is defined in [...] and broadly encompasses those computers used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including ones located outside the United States. The law governing obligatory and voluntary disclosure of customer communications by cable companies was altered to allow agencies to demand such communications under U.S.C. Title 18 provisions relating to the disclosure of electronic communications (chapter 119), pen registers and trap and trace devices (chapter 206) and stored communications (121), though it excluded the disclosure of cable subscriber viewing habits. Subpoenas issued to Internet Service Providers were expanded to include not only [...] "the name, address, local and long distance telephone toll billing records, telephone number or other subscriber number or identity, and length of service of a subscriber" [...] but also session times and durations, types of services used, communication device address information (e.g. IP addresses), payment method and bank account and credit card numbers. Communication providers are also allowed to disclose customer records or communications if they <b>suspect</b> <b>there</b> is a danger to [...] "life and limb".|$|E
