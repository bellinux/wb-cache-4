5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the <b>Stark</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Stark</b> <b>effect</b> is {{responsible}} for the pressure broadening (Stark broadening) of spectral lines by charged particles. When the split/shifted lines appear in absorption, the effect is called the inverse <b>Stark</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

40|$|In a {{field of}} 100 Kv. /cm. <b>Stark</b> <b>effects</b> have been {{observed}} for eighty-six normal levels in argon, and for seventy-five in krypton. Thirty-four electric combination 1 ines {{have been found in}} argon and forty-eight in krypton. Typical sections of the energy leve 1 diagrams for Ne, A,Kr, and Xe are drawn to represent the normal levels and their <b>Stark</b> <b>effects.</b> The diagrams serve as a basis for the qualitative explanation of themain features observed. Since 1 nbercombinations between terms of high and low limit respectively are much weaker in neon than in argon; it is found that in the former gasthe <b>Stark</b> <b>effects</b> for the two sets of terms are much more nearly independent. The reversal of the direction of displacement of several terms in argon and krypton with increasing field is discussed. The number of Stark terms deduced from observations in the fie 1 d is never greater than the number of m values a 11 owed by the j vaLue of the term.

40|$|Vibrational <b>Stark</b> <b>effects,</b> {{which are}} the effects of {{electric}} fields on vibrational spectra, were measured previously for the C-N stretch mode of several small nitriles, yielding difference dipole moments, difference polarizabilities, and transition polarizabilities for each species [Andrews, S. S.; Boxer, S. G. J. Phys. Chem. A 2000, 104, 11 853]. This paper explains the physical origins of the observed <b>Stark</b> <b>effects</b> using two theoretical models and, in the process, computes several molecular parameters for each nitrile. A model with a single vibrational mode, developed with perturbation theory, is found to explain most of the experimental <b>Stark</b> <b>effects.</b> Because it cannot account for coupling between modes, which is ubiquitous and important for resonant vibrations and for combination mode absorption, another model is developed which considers multiple vibrational modes and three spatial degrees of freedom. It is found that difference dipole moments arise {{from a combination of}} mechanical anharmonicity and electronic perturbations of chemical bonds, where the two factors have about equal magnitudes for nitriles. Transition polarizabilities are dominated by the effects of electronic polarizability of the sample molecule, which alters the partial charges on atoms in an electric field. <b>Stark</b> <b>effects</b> of resonant transitions are found to be equal to linear combinations of the effects for the basis states, which explains an experimental observation. For overtone and combination transitions, Stark shifts are predicted to be the sums of the shifts of the component transitions. Absolute overtone intensities can be calculated from difference dipole results, which is experimentally verified. In summary, these theories largely explain the physical origins of observed vibrational <b>Stark</b> <b>effects</b> and can predict <b>Stark</b> <b>effects</b> {{for a wide variety of}} other systems...|$|R

25|$|In a {{semiconductor}} heterostructure, {{where a small}} bandgap {{material is}} sandwiched between two layers of a larger bandgap material, the <b>Stark</b> <b>effect</b> can be dramatically enhanced by bound excitons.

25|$|However, {{this is not}} to {{say that}} the Bohr-Sommerfeld model was without its successes. Calculations based on the Bohr–Sommerfeld model were able to {{accurately}} explain a number of more complex atomic spectral effects. For example, up to first-order perturbations, the Bohr model and quantum mechanics make the same predictions for the spectral line splitting in the <b>Stark</b> <b>effect.</b> At higher-order perturbations, however, the Bohr model and quantum mechanics differ, and measurements of the <b>Stark</b> <b>effect</b> under high field strengths helped confirm the correctness of quantum mechanics over the Bohr model.

This is only approximate because the sum of a Coulomb potential with a linear potential is unstable (has no true bound states) although the tunneling time (decay rate) is very long.

40|$|<b>Stark</b> <b>effects</b> in Rydberg {{states of}} xenon atoms were {{investigated}} both experimentally and theoretically. The experimental part consisted of laser-induced fluorescence-dip spectroscopy. Using a (2 + 1) -photon excitation scheme, xenon atoms were excited {{from the ground}} state to high-lying Rydberg ns and nd levels. Measurements were made in a controllable electric field environment, produced by applying a pulsed voltage to two parallel metal electrodes. For energy levels with principal quantum numbers ranging from 12 to 18, Stark shifts of up to 4. 8 cm– 1 were observed for electric fields ranging from 0 to 4000 V/cm. Additionally, mixing of energy levels in high electric fields was measured for nd levels. The experimental results were compared to a theoretical calculation based on solving the Schrödinger equation for a perturbed Hamiltonian. The calculation method proved to be very accurate for predicting <b>Stark</b> <b>effects</b> in Rydberg nd levels, while for ns levels the agreement was only moderate, probably due to deviations from the assumption of a hydrogenlike atom that {{is used in the}} calculation. Finally, the feasibility of using measurements of Stark shifts of Rydberg levels as a diagnostic for electric fields in low-pressure discharges was discussed...|$|R

25|$|The <b>Stark</b> <b>effect</b> {{can lead}} to {{splitting}} of degenerate energy levels. For example, in the Bohr model, an electron has the same energy whether {{it is in the}} 2s state or any of the 2p states. However, in an electric field, there will be hybrid orbitals (also called quantum superpositions) of the 2s and 2p states where the electron tends to be to the left, which will acquire a lower energy, and other hybrid orbitals where the electron tends to be to the right, which will acquire a higher energy. Therefore, the formerly degenerate energy levels will split into slightly lower and slightly higher energy levels.|$|E

A general exact solution of this vibronic problem has been given by Ham (1973 a). We extend the work by a numerical investigation of this ideal pseudo-Jahn-Teller problem. Vibronic energy levels and wave functions, emission spectra at various temperatures, absorption lines and spectra at T= 0, and reduction factors are calculated for various values of the vibronic coupling strength and of the electronic 2 s- 2 p spacing. The results are compared with explicit expressions of the weak and strong coupling limit. In addition, the absorption line shape is calculated in semi-classical approximation. The relaxed excited state of the F centre is investigated within this model by a perturbation analysis for the case of weak electron-phonon coupling.
