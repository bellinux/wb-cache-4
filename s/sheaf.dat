5|$|From {{the point}} of view of <b>sheaf</b> cohomology, the Mayer–Vietoris {{sequence}} is related to Čech cohomology. Specifically, it arises from the degeneration of the spectral sequence that relates Čech cohomology to <b>sheaf</b> cohomology (sometimes called the Mayer–Vietoris spectral sequence) in the case where the open cover used to compute the Čech cohomology consists of two open sets. This spectral sequence exists in arbitrary topoi.|$|E
5|$|The name Sheffield is Old English in origin. It {{derives from}} the River <b>Sheaf,</b> whose name is a {{corruption}} of shed or sheth, meaning to divide or separate.

Other Iron Age hill forts in the area are Carl Wark on Hathersage Moor to the southwest of Sheffield, and one at Scholes Wood, near Rotherham.

Kubera holds a mace, a pomegranate or a money bag in his hand. He may also carry a <b>sheaf</b> of jewels or a mongoose with him.

5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, {{the outside of the}} church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a <b>sheaf</b> of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. S.

40|$|The {{theory of}} integral, or Fourier-Mukai, {{transforms}} between derived categories of <b>sheaves</b> {{is a well}} established tool in noncommutative algebraic geometry. General "representation theorems" identify all reasonable linear functors between categories of perfect complexes (or their "large" version, quasi-coherent <b>sheaves)</b> on schemes and stacks over some fixed base with integral kernels {{in the form of}} <b>sheaves</b> (of the same nature) on the fiber product. However, for many applications in mirror symmetry and geometric representation theory one is interested instead in the bounded derived category of coherent <b>sheaves</b> (or its "large" version, ind-coherent <b>sheaves),</b> which differs from perfect complexes (and quasi-coherent <b>sheaves)</b> once the underlying variety is singular. In this paper, we give general representation theorems for linear functors between categories of coherent <b>sheaves</b> over a base in terms of integral kernels on the fiber product. Namely, we identify coherent kernels with functors taking perfect complexes to coherent <b>sheaves,</b> and kernels which are coherent relative to the source with functors taking all coherent <b>sheaves</b> to coherent <b>sheaves.</b> The proofs rely on key aspects of the "functional analysis" of derived categories, namely the distinction between small and large categories and its measurement using $t$-structures. These are used in particular to correct the failure of integral transforms on Ind-coherent <b>sheaves</b> to correspond to such <b>sheaves</b> on a fiber product. The results are applied in a companion paper to the representation theory of the affine Hecke category, identifying affine character <b>sheaves</b> with the spectral geometric Langlands category in genus one.
