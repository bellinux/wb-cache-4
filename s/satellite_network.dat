5|$|In 1980, Amway {{purchased}} WHN in New York, giving Mutual {{a second}} major-market owned-and-operated station. On a Country Road, a music show hosted by WHN's Lee Arnold, was introduced and given national distribution. At {{the beginning of}} the year, Mutual had begun airing Mutual Radio Theater, formerly Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as part of the anthology series. In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its <b>satellite</b> <b>network</b> was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of Mutual. The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, aired its final show on December 19, 1981. In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL to Statewide Broadcasting. A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.|$|E

In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year—950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS. It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Satellite</b> <b>networks</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly important because of the ex-citing global communication services they provide. Key management policies have been successfully deployed in terrestrial networks to guarantee the information se-curity. However, long propagation, storage and computation constraints bring new challenges in designing efficient and cost-effective key updating policies for <b>satellite</b> <b>networks.</b> Based on the structure and communication features of <b>satellite</b> <b>networks,</b> a dynamic key management model for <b>satellite</b> <b>networks</b> (DKM-SN) is presented, which includes certificates owned by each satellite, primary keys and session keys {{both of which are}} shared between two satellites. Furthermore, a protocol is designed for updating certificates for satellites; different policies for updating primary and ses-sion keys are studied and their efficiency and security are analyzed and compared. In addition, simulation environment for <b>satellite</b> <b>networks</b> is built and the key updat-ing processes are implemented in Walker constellation. From the simulation results, further contrasts on key updating time and storage costs between the applications of IBM hybrid key management model (HKMM) and DKM-SN in <b>satellite</b> <b>networks</b> are presented. Finally, important suggestions in designing key updating policies are given...|$|R
