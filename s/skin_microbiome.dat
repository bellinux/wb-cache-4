40|$|Cutaneous {{bacteria}} {{may play}} an important role in the resistance of amphibians to the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Microbial communities resident on hosts' skin show topographical diversity mapping to skin features, as demonstrated by studies of the human <b>microbiome.</b> We examined <b>skin</b> <b>microbiomes</b> of wild and captive fire-bellied toads (Bombina orientalis) for differences across their body surface. We found that bacterial communities differed between ventral and dorsal skin. Wild toads showed slightly higher bacterial richness and diversity in the dorsal compared to the ventral region. On the other hand, captive toads hosted a higher richness and diversity of bacteria on their ventral than their dorsal skin. Microbial community composition and relative abundance of major bacterial taxonomic groups also differed between ventral and dorsal skin in all populations. Furthermore, microbiome diversity patterns varied as a function of their Bd infection status in wild toads. Bacterial richness and diversity was greater, and microbial community structure more complex, in wild than captive toads. The results suggest that bacterial community structure is influenced by microhabitats associated with skin regions. These local communities may be differentially modified when interacting with environmental bacteria and Bd. A better understanding of <b>microbiome</b> variation across <b>skin</b> regions will be needed to assess how the skin microbiota affects the abilities of amphibian hosts to resist Bd infection, especially in captive breeding programs.

40|$|Ranaviruses, the causative viral {{pathogens}} {{behind one}} of the most widespread and deadly amphibian diseases have been present in the UK since at least the late 1980 s. They have been implicated as the cause of mass mortality events and associated populations declines observed in the European common frog (Rana temporaria). Early public engagement in the study of ranaviral emergence in the UK {{led to the formation of}} a unique network of mostly privately owned field sites, each housing a population of R. temporaria of known ranaviral disease history. Working within this comparative network of populations, I investigated how a history of ranaviral disease impacts upon various aspects of R. temporaria populations. An experimental infection trial demonstrated that prior population history of ranaviral infection does not influence the ability of metamorphic R. temporaria to control pathogen burdens after primary infection, though individual body weight does. A comparative wild transcriptomics study, implemented using novel methodologies, found no evidence that a positive history of ranavirosis results in significant functional changes in the transcriptome of frog populations. An extensive study of the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiomes</b> of wild R. temporaria revealed for the first time that the commensal bacterial communities present on the skin of wild amphibians might be as intimately linked to ranaviruses as they are to other amphibian pathogens. And finally, skeletochronological analysis of wild adult R. temporaria provided first evidence that infection with a ranavirus reduces the age distribution in positive disease history populations, potentially altering host life history strategies and heightening risk of local extinction.

40|$|The Pacific coast tick, Dermacentor occidentalis Marx, {{is found}} {{throughout}} California and can harbor agents that cause human {{diseases such as}} anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and rickettsiosis 364 D. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} nonpathogenic endosymbiotic bacteria can interfere with Rickettsia co-infections in other tick species. We hypothesized that within D. occidentalis ticks, interference may exist between different nonpathogenic endosymbiotic or nonendosymbiotic bacteria and Spotted Fever group Rickettsia (SFGR). Using PCR amplification and sequencing of the rompA gene and intergenic region we identified a cohort of SFGR-infected and non-infected D. occidentalis ticks collected from San Diego County. We then amplified a partial segment of the 16 S rRNA gene and used next-generation sequencing to elucidate the microbiomes and levels of co-infection in the ticks. The SFGR R. philipii str. 364 D and R. rhipicephali were detected in 2. 3 % and 8. 2 % of the ticks, respectively, via rompA sequencing. Interestingly, next generation sequencing revealed an inverse relationship between the number of Francisella-like endosymbiont (FLE) 16 S rRNA sequences and Rickettsia 16 S rRNA sequences within individual ticks that is consistent with partial interference between FLE and SFGR infecting ticks. After excluding the Rickettsia and FLE endosymbionts from the analysis, there was a small but significant difference in microbial community diversity and a pattern of geographic isolation by distance between collection locales. In addition, male ticks had a greater diversity of bacteria than female ticks and ticks that weren’t infected with SFGR had similar <b>microbiomes</b> to canine <b>skin</b> <b>microbiomes.</b> Although experimental studies are required for confirmation, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that FLEs and, to a lesser extent, other bacteria, interfere with the ability of D. occidentalis to be infected with certain SFGR.

It affects 15 %– 30 % of children and 2 %– 10 % of adults. AD characteristically alternates between periods of exacerbation or flares and periods of remission, which may be therapeutically induced or spontaneous. Current knowledge about AD includes abnormalities of the skin barrier (physical and chemical), the immune barrier, and more recently, the microbial barrier or microbiota. There is growing evidence for a tight relationship between them. To obtain satisfactory control of this condition, the clinical strategy to manage AD involves prescribing both anti-inflammatory medications and dermocosmetic products. The role of the physician is therefore to advise the patient with regard to hygiene measures aimed to help to improve these three barriers or to prevent any further deterioration.

40|$|Most {{studies of}} the human {{microbiome}} have focused on westernized people with life-style practices that decrease microbial survival and transmission, or on traditional societies that are currently in transition to westernization. We characterize the fecal, oral, and <b>skin</b> bacterial <b>microbiome</b> and resistome of members of an isolated Yanomami Amerindian village with no documented previous contact with Western people. These Yanomami harbor a microbiome with the highest diversity of bacteria and genetic functions ever reported in a human group. Despite their isolation, presumably for 3 ̆e 11, 000 years since their ancestors arrived in South America, and no known exposure to antibiotics, they harbor bacteria that carry functional antibiotic resistance (AR) genes, including those that confer resistance to synthetic antibiotics and are syntenic with mobilization elements. These results suggest that westernization significantly affects human microbiome diversity and that functional AR genes {{appear to be a}} feature of the human microbiome {{even in the absence of}} exposure to commercial antibiotics.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Human skin {{is a large}} (~ 1. 75 m 2) organ {{containing}} {{a large number of}} ecologically distinct sites. These sites harbor a variety of distinct microbiomes. One challenge is to define the microbiome at every site. We chose two interesting sites: the base of the Front of the neck and the base of the Back of the neck (the nape) and enrolled forty volunteers. These two sites are interesting because the bacteria therein must interact with the <b>skin</b> and its <b>microbiome</b> and with clothing and hair and the external environment. Approach: The volunteers took their own neck swabs. Total DNA was prepared from each swab. That DNA was employed as a template in separate PCR reactions to amplify the V 6 and V 3 regions of the 16 S ribosomal RNA gene. The V 6 and V 3 regions were pyrosequenced using Roche 454 Life Sciences technology. To identify the bacteria, the sequences were compared to the data in the Ribosomal Database Project. Results: From the sequences of the V 6 region, it was found that all of the swabs contained at least 1 % of the reads as Actinobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. The substantial majority of the swabs contained at least 1 % of the reads as Alphaproteobacteria, Bacilli and Betaproteobacteria.

40|$|Background A {{wide range}} of {{microorganisms}} inhabit animal skin. This microbial community (microbiome) {{plays an important role}} in host defense against pathogens and disease. Bats (Chiroptera: Mammalia) are an ecologically and evolutionarily diversified group with a relatively unexplored <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome.</b> The bat <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> could play a role in disease resistance, for example, to white nose syndrome (WNS), an infection which has been devastating North American bat populations. However, fundamental knowledge of the bat <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> is needed before understanding its role in health and disease resistance. Captive neotropical frugivorous bats Artibeus jamaicensis and Carollia perspicillataprovide a simple controlled system in which to characterize the factors shaping the bat microbiome. Here, we aimed to determine the relative importance of habitat and host species on the bat <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome.</b> Methods We performed high-throughput 16 S rRNA gene sequencing of the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> of two different bat species living in captivity in two different habitats. In the first habitat, A. jamaicensis and C. perspicillata lived together, while the second habitat contained only A. jamaicensis.

Cohabitating A. jamaicensis and C. perspicillata shared more similar skin microbiomes than members of the same species (A. jamaicensis) across two habitats. Discussion These results suggest that in captivity, the skin microbial community is homogenised by the shared environments and individual proximities of bats living together in the same habitat, at the expense of the innate host species factors. The predominant influence of habitat suggests that environmental microorganisms or pathogens might colonize bat skin.

40|$|Uwe Wollina Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Academic Teaching Hospital Dresden-Friedrichstadt, Dresden, Germany Abstract: Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is {{a common}} chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting ~ 10 – 20 % of the general population. AD is characterized by disturbances in epidermal barrier function and hyperactive immune response. Recently, changes in the skin and intestinal microbiome have been analyzed in more detail. The available data suggest a link between disturbed <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> and course of the disease. Flares of the disease are associated with an expansion of Staphylococcus aureus on lesional skin and a substantial loss of biodiversity in <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome.</b> Staphylococci exoproteins and superantigens evoke inflammatory reactions in the host. <b>Skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> includes superficial stratum corneum that is affected by environmental factors such as exposure to germs and cleansing. Available evidence argues for a link between epidermal barrier impairment and disturbances in <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> in AD. In contrast to <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome,</b> intestinal microbiome seems to become stabilized after infancy. There is also a significant heritable component for intestinal microbiome. The microbial taxa, relative percentages and quantities vary remarkably between the {{different parts of the}} intestinal tract. Early intestinal microbial colonization may be a critical step for prevention of further development of AD. Skin barrier-aimed topical treatments help to develop a neo-microbiome from deeper compartments. Probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics have been investigated for the treatment of AD, but further investigations are needed. Targeted treatment options to normalize skin and intestinal microbiome in AD are under investigation.

Development of the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> in preterm infants or its determinants {{in the first}} 4 weeks of life has not been evaluated. We evaluated the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> from three body sites, antecubital fossa, forehead and gluteal region, in a prospective cohort of 15 preterm (birth weight < 1500 g and < 32 weeks of gestation) and 15 term neonates. The microbiome community membership and relative abundance were evaluated by amplification and sequencing the bacterial V 3 -V 5 region of the 16 S rRNA gene on the 454 GS FLX platform. We used linear mixed effects models to analyze longitudinal data. The structure and composition of the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> did not differ between the three sampling sites for term and preterm infants in the neonatal period.

Characterization of the microorganisms on skin {{is essential for}} understanding how a host evolves in association with its microbial symbionts, modeling immune system development, diagnosing illnesses, and exploring the origins of potential zoonoses that affect humans. Distinct microbial communities inhabit individuals {{as part of the}} human <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome,</b> which are continually shed to the surrounding environment. Microbial communities from 17 skin sites of 10 sexually active cohabiting couples (20 individuals) were sampled to test whether cohabitation impacts an individual’s <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome,</b> leading to shared skin microbiota among partner pairs. Amplified 16 S rRNA genes of bacteria and archaea from a total of 340 skin swabs were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing and the results demonstrated that cohabitation was significantly associated with microbial community composition, although this association was greatly exceeded by characteristics of body location and individuality. Random forest modeling demonstrated that partners could be predicted 86 % of the time (p < 0. 001) based on their <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> profiles, which was always greater than combinations of incorrectly matched partners. Cohabiting couples had the most similar overall microbial skin communities on their feet, according to Bray-Curtis distances. In contrast, thigh microbial communities were strongly associated with biological sex rather than cohabiting partner. Additional factors that were associated with the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> of specific body locations included the use of skin care products, pet ownership, allergies, and alcohol consumption. These baseline data identified links between the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> and daily interactions among cohabiting individuals, adding to known factors that shape the human microbiome and, by extension, its relation to human health. Although many studies have characterized the human microbiome, far less is known about the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> of non-human mammals. The objective of this research was to create a baseline <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> dataset for the Mammalia class, testing the effects of species, location, hygiene, body region, and biological sex. The back, torso, and inner thigh regions of 177 non-human mammals and 20 human participants were collected to include representatives from 38 species and 10 mammalian orders. Animals were collected from local farms, zoos, households, and the wild. All samples were amplified using the V 3 -V 4 16 S rRNA gene region and sequenced using a MiSeq (Illumina). Human skin was significantly less diverse than all other mammalian orders according to Shannon indices (6. 54 versus 3. 96, p < 0. 001). The factor most strongly associated with community variation for all samples was whether the host was a human (PERMANOVA, F = 37. 8, p < 0. 001). By analyzing all samples together, random forest modelling identified that human and animal samples could be distinguished correctly 98. 51. 2 % of the time.

This study examines the skin and wound microbiome in type II diabetes. Methods Eight type II diabetic subjects with chronic foot ulcers were followed over a time course of 10 weeks, sampling from both foot skin (swabs) and wounds (swabs and debrided tissue) every two weeks. A control group of eight control subjects was also followed over 10 weeks, and skin swabs collected from the foot skin every two weeks.

These microbes contribute to cutaneous health, by providing colonization resistance and regulating immunity, however disruption of skin microbiota {{has been linked to}} diseases, like acne and atopic dermatitis. While the microbiome is a promising therapeutic target, we do not fully understand the mechanisms underlying the microbial contributions to disease pathogenesis. It is therefore crucial to develop comprehensive knowledge of both the structure of the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> and the host functions it stimulates. Here, we present a critical analysis of the composition and metabolic potential of healthy human skin microbiota and how these communities modulate the gene expression of their hosts. In the first section, we optimize methodologies for <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> studies and utilize the best approaches to characterize the bacteria, viruses, and fungi colonizing healthy skin. We applied amplification and sequencing of two hyper variable regions of the 16 S rRNA gene, in addition to whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing, to cutaneous swab samples from a healthy cohort. We demonstrate that shotgun sequencing yields the most accurate profiles of the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome,</b> but that sequencing of the V 1 -V 3 region of the 16 S rRNA gene is a suitable, cost-effective alternative. We also reveal significant taxonomic, functional, and temporal diversity of skin microbial communities and highlight potential multi-kingdom interactions between skin phages and their bacterial hosts. The second section focuses on the response of the cutaneous transcriptome to colonization by resident microflora. We used RNA sequencing to compare gene expression in skin collected from sterile, germ-free mice, and mice conventionally raised in the presence of microbiota.

Microbiota compositions of diseased lesional skin (in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis) showed distinct differences compared with healthy skin. The function of microbial colonization in establishing immune system homeostasis has been reported, whereas host–microbe interactions and genetically determined variation of stratum corneum properties might be linked to skin dysbiosis. Both are relevant for cutaneous disorders with aberrant immune responses and/or disturbed skin barrier function. Modulation of skin microbiota composition to restore host–microbiota homeostasis could be future strategies to treat or prevent disease...|$|E
40|$|Assessing {{the health}} state of wild marine mammals and their populations is challenging, {{and there is}} a growing need to develop {{reliable}} proxies for health determination. Climate change and other anthropogenic factors are influencing disease prevalence and virulence in the marine environment {{and there is a}} need to improve tools and techniques for monitoring the health status of wild marine mammals that are listed as threatened or endangered. The skin is the largest mammalian organ and serves as the first line of defense between the host and their external environment. Most research has focused on human health and has found that the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> can serve as a protective mechanism by adding to the skin’s defense against colonization of potential pathogenic bacteria. The skin is relatively well-sampled in marine mammals and may serve as a useful proxy for health status, as demonstrated in humans. However, before skin microbiomes become useful health diagnostic tools for marine mammals, more information is needed about the factors influencing variability within the skin microbial community. I analyzed the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> of 72 apparently healthy humpback whales primarily from Antarctica, as well as Alaska, Hawaii, American Samoa, and the Gulf of Maine. Phylogenetic and statistical analyses revealed two dominant families of bacteria (Moraxellaceae and Flavobacteriaceae) found on each individual whale. However, there were significant differences in the skin microbiomes amongst whales from different geographic areas, both globally as well as amongst regions within Antarctica. These findings provide support that there is a species-specific microbiome on humpback skin that varies according to geographic factors. This initial characterization of the healthy humpback <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> in Antarctica is helpful for future health diagnostic efforts aimed especially at heath-compromised animals. This research ultimately aims to be the building blocks for exploring how the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> can be used as a diagnostic tool for monitoring marine mammal health...|$|E
40|$|The <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> is a {{critical}} component of human health, however, little is understood about the daily dynamics of <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> community assembly and the skin’s potential to acquire microorganisms from the external environment. I performed a series of microbial transfers using three skin habitat types (dry, moist, sebaceous) on human subject volunteers. Microbial communities were transferred to recipient skin using a sterile swab 1) from other skin sites on the same individual, 2) from other skin sites on a different individual, 3) and from two environmental donor sources (plant leaf surfaces and farm soil). With these experiments I was able to test for the presence of initial transfer effects and for the persistence of those effects over the time period sampled (2 -, 4 -, 8 -, and 24 -hours post-transfer). The sebaceous skin community was associated with the strongest initial effect of transfer and persistence on the moist recipient skin site, {{and to a lesser extent}} the dry skin site. The soil donor community when transferred to dry skin resulted in the strongest initial transfer effect and was persistent over 8 - and even 24 -hours post-transfer. These experiments are the first in scope and scale to directly demonstrate that dispersal from other human or environmental microbial communities are plausible drivers of community dynamics in the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome...</b>|$|E
40|$|Host-associated {{microbial}} {{communities are}} ubiquitous among animals, and serve important functions. For example, the bacterial <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> of amphibians {{can play a}} role in preventing or reducing infection by the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Evidence suggests that environmental bacteria likely serve as a source pool for {{at least some of the}} members of the amphibian skin bacterial community, underscoring the potential for local environmental changes to disrupt microbial community source pools that could be critical to the health of host organisms. However, few studies have assessed variation in the amphibian <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> along clear environmental gradients, and so we know relatively little about how local environmental conditions influence microbiome diversity. We sampled the skin bacterial communities of Coqui frogs, Eleutherodactylus coqui (N =  77), along an elevational gradient in eastern Puerto Rico (0 – 875 m), with transects in two land use types: intact forest (N =  4 sites) and disturbed (N =  3 sites) forest. We found that alpha diversity (as assessed by Shannon, Simpson, and Phylogenetic Diversity indices) varied across sites, but this variation was not correlated with elevation or land use. Beta diversity (community structure), on the other hand, varied with site, elevation and land use, primarily due to changes in the relative abundance of certain bacterial OTUs (∼species) within these communities. Importantly, although microbiome diversity varied, E. coqui maintained a common core microbiota across all sites. Thus, our findings suggest that environmental conditions can influence the composition of the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> of terrestrial amphibians, but that some aspects of the microbiome remain consistent despite environmental variation...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{communities}} play central {{roles in}} animal health. Host species, environmental conditions and presence of pathogens {{can affect the}} diversity and composition of animal-associated microbiomes. Amphibians form integral and functionally important symbioses with microbes. The amphibian microbiome interacts with pathogens, and can protect hosts from disease, including the disease chytridiomycosis, caused by skin infection by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). The implications of amphibian-microbiome associations are difficult to predict because {{little is known about}} the factors shaping bacterial communities or their functional traits, such as anti-Bd properties. I used culture-dependent and culture-independent methods to characterize the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> of Plethodon salamanders in field and laboratory studies. I hypothesized that the evolutionary history, environmental conditions, and health status of the hosts shape skin bacterial community assemblages. In a field study, I sampled sympatric, congeneric salamander species (Plethodon cinereus, P. glutinosus, P. cylindraceus) across three localities to quantify the distribution of both anti-Bd bacteria and the entire bacterial community. I identified 50 anti-Bd bacterial OTUs and 480 bacterial OTUs overall on the salamander skin, with high prevalence and abundance of anti-Bd bacterial genera Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas. Within a locality, co-occurring salamanders generally had similar microbiome diversity and composition patterns, but these differed among sites. This indicates that environment is more influential in shaping <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> patterns than differences in host properties in these species. I sampled P. cinereus along an elevational gradient, as a proxy for environmental variables that co-vary with elevation. Microbiome diversity and composition changed with elevation, in which compositional changes were related to soil pH. In a laboratory experiment, I quantified the responses of P. cinereus and the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> to temperature (13, 17, 21 °C) and pathogen (Bd+, Bd-) exposure to determine whether the native microbiome affected survival at natural temperatures. Temperature changed the microbiome, but this did not prevent host mortality from Bd. Instead, Bd exposure changed the microbiome and caused 78 % mortality. My results demonstrate that environmental conditions and pathogen presence are important factors determining <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> structure in Plethodon salamanders. These findings contribute to our understanding of animal-microbial symbioses, microbial community ecology, and amphibian disease ecology...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecent {{advances}} have increased {{our understanding of}} the human microbiome, including the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome.</b> Despite the importance of the hands as a vector for infection transmission, there have been no comprehensive reviews of recent advances in hand microbiome research or overviews of the factors that influence the composition of the hand microbiome. A comprehensive and systematic database search was conducted for skin microbiome-related articles published from January 1, 2008 to April 1, 2015. Only primary research articles that used culture-independent, whole community analysis methods to study the healthy hand <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> were included. Eighteen articles were identified containing hand microbiome data. Most focused on bacteria, with relatively little reported on fungi, viruses, and protozoa. Bacteria from four phyla were found across all studies of the hand microbiome (most to least relative abundance) : Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes. Key factors that impacted the hand microbiome composition included temporal and biogeographical dynamics, as well as intrinsic (age, gender) and extrinsic (product use, cohabitants, pet-ownership) variables. There was more temporal variability in the composition of the hand microbiome than in other body sites, making identification of the “normal” microbiome of the hands challenging. The microbiome of the hands is in constant flux as the hands are a critical vector for transmitting microorganisms between people, pets, inanimate objects and our environments. Future studies need to resolve methodological influences on results, and further investigate factors which alter the hand microbiome including the impact of products applied to hands. Increased understanding of the hand microbiome and the <b>skin</b> <b>microbiome</b> in general, will open the door to product development for disease prevention and treatment, and may lead to other applications, including novel diagnostic and forensic approaches...|$|E
