50|$|The {{financial}} {{industrial complex}} is migrating {{from the use}} of magnetic stripes on debit and credit cards which technically require a swipe through a magnetic card <b>swipe</b> <b>reader.</b> The number of transactions per minute can be increased, and more transactions can be processed in a shorter time, therefore making for arguably shorter lines at the cashier.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the card}} and {{associated}} game, the e-cards are typically used in a key-like function to unlock secret items, levels, or play mini-games when <b>swiped</b> through the <b>reader.</b> See below for a comprehensive list of cards and their functions. The cards themselves contain data, as opposed to unlocking data already on the device itself.|$|R
50|$|Angle {{modulation}} of ferromagnetic particles: A code {{is embedded}} into the magnetic stripe using {{read and write}} heads operating diagonally to the direction of <b>swipe</b> in the <b>reader.</b> With appropriate signal processing, these can read and encode {{a small amount of}} additional data which is polarised in a different axis to the ISO standard tracks.|$|R
50|$|As of January 2014, {{the system}} has {{approximately}} 110 hubs. Each hub contains between 9 and 24 bikes. The rental card is <b>swiped</b> over a <b>reader</b> and a computer screen displays {{the number of the}} bike that is being unlocked. The user now has 3 hours to return the bike (i.e. lock) to any of the hubs in the city.|$|R
50|$|Smart cards {{have been}} adopted to limit fraud—such as forged monthly passes and short-changed fares—and to reduce the {{potential}} for conflict between driver and passenger. Rather than showing the card to the driver, the card is <b>swiped</b> across the <b>reader</b> and may remain inside a wallet. Transfers are barcoded and scanned when a passenger boards. The new fare boxes do not accept bills, but coins are accepted and the values displayed to both rider and driver.|$|R
25|$|The newer day passes can be {{used only}} on the {{appropriate}} day because the machine encodes the date and expiration time in the magnetic strip, which is read when swiped through the magnetic <b>reader.</b> <b>Swiping</b> the pass also sets a time waiting period on reuse so the pass cannot be immediately handed to a different passenger and used for free boarding. This also {{makes it difficult for}} passengers to use counterfeit passes when boarding the bus, Light Rail, and Metro Subway.|$|R
50|$|Wiegand card {{technology}} is a patented technology using embedded ferromagnetic wires strategically positioned to create a unique pattern that generates the identification number. Like magnetic stripe or barcode technology, this card must be <b>swiped</b> through a <b>reader</b> to be read. Unlike the other technologies, the identification media {{is embedded in the}} card and not susceptible to wear. This technology once gained popularity because it is difficult to duplicate, creating a high perception of security. This {{technology is}} being replaced by proximity cards, however, because of the limited source of supply, the relatively better tamper resistance of proximity readers, and the convenience of the touch-less functionality in proximity readers.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to empirically {{determine}} which of several security hardware interface designs produced the highest levels of end-user performance and acceptance. The FESSP Security Alarms and Monitoring Systems program area commissioned the authors study as decision support for upgrading the Argus security system`s primary user interface so that Argus equipment will support the new DOE and DoD security access badges. Twenty-two test subjects were repeatedly tested using six remote access panel (RAP) designs. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) uses one of these interface designs in its security access booths. Along with the RAP B insert-style reader, the authors tested five prototype RAP variants, each with a different style of <b>swipe</b> badge <b>reader,</b> through which a badge is moved or swiped. The authors asked the untrained test subjects to use each RAP while they described how they thought they should respond so that the system would operate correctly in reading the magnetic strip on a security badge. With each RAP variant, subjects were required to make four successful card reads (swipes) in which the card reader correctly read and logged the transaction. After each trial, a subject completed a 10 -item interface acceptance evaluation before approaching the next RAP. After interacting with the RAP interfaces (for a total of the six RAP trials), each subject completed a 7 -item overview evaluation that compared and ranked the five experimental RAPs, using the original (RAP B) insert style as a standard...|$|R
