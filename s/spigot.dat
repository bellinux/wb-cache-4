5|$|This {{involved}} {{the replacement of}} 'A' gun by a Hedgehog anti-submarine <b>spigot</b> mortar, the removal of her director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge {{in exchange for a}} Type 271 target indication radar, exchanging her two 2-pounder AA guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20mm AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform, and the removal of her 12-pounder AA gun. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to 98 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|When she was {{converted}} into an escort destroyer in late 1943, 'B' gun {{was replaced by}} a Hedgehog anti-submarine <b>spigot</b> mortar and stowage was increased for a total of 70 depth charges which meant that 'Y' gun and the 12-pounder AA gun had to be removed to compensate for the weight.

5|$|Royal Artillery {{military}} fortifications {{were established}} at Cley beach, including two 6-inch (15.24cm) guns, five buildings, two pillboxes, a minefield, and concrete anti-tank blocks. A <b>spigot</b> mortar emplacement and an Allan Williams Turret machine gun emplacement were sited {{closer to the}} village. One of the pillboxes and remains of the beach gun emplacements were still surviving as of 2012. The military camp accommodated 160 men and was later used to hold prisoners of war. Near {{the end of the}} war, the camp was used to house East European refugees, and was finally pulled down in 1948. Many of the wartime buildings were destroyed by the Royal Engineers in 1955, but the generator house was taken over by the coastguard service as an observation post. It was acquired by the NWT in 1983, and the upper part was used as a look-out, while the larger lower section became a beach café. The building was overwhelmed by shingle in a storm in 2008, and subsequently demolished.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its {{corresponding}} extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten {{pieces of a}} Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting {{a certain number of}} gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a <b>spigot</b> that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level.|$|E
25|$|Given these shortcomings, those modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons. One of these was the Blacker Bombard, designed by Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Blacker, the origins of which {{went back to the}} 1930s. During {{the early part of the}} 1930s, Blacker became interested in the concept of the <b>spigot</b> mortar. Unlike conventional mortars the <b>spigot</b> mortar did not possess a barrel, and instead there was a steel rod known as a 'spigot' fixed to a baseplate; the bomb itself had a propellant charge inside its tail. When the mortar was to be fired, the bomb was pushed down onto the <b>spigot,</b> which exploded the propellant charge and blew the bomb into the air.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{means by}} which female wolf spiders attach an egg sac to their spinnerets was inves-tigated using {{scanning}} electron microscopy. In four Pardosa species, we observed that silk fibers emerging from ampullate gland <b>spigots</b> had been affixed {{to the surface of}} the egg sac. More specifically, primary (18) and secondary (28) major ampullate (MaA) glands and 18 and 28 minor ampullate (MiA) glands all contributed fibers for this purpose. The diameters of the 28 MaA and 28 MiA fibers were greater than those of the 18 MaA and 18 MiA fibers and, correspondingly, the widths of the 28 ampullate <b>spigots</b> were clearly greater than those of the 18 ampullate <b>spigots.</b> Larger 28 ampullate <b>spigots</b> were also observed in adult females of species from three other lycosid genera. Thus, 28 ampullate glands, which in araneoids function only in juveniles during proecdysis, are not only functional in adult female lycosids (and adult females of several other families), but they appear to play a greater role than the 18 ampullate glands in egg sac attachment. Observations made on the 18 and 28 ampullate <b>spigots</b> of adult females from species belonging to several other families are also presented. Cuticular structures referred to as nubbins and tartipores are present in some spinning fields on spinnerets. A proposal is made for defining these terms by a criterion, namely their different origins, which differs from that applied previously...|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} artificially {{synthesise}} spider silk into fibres, {{there are two}} broad areas that must be covered. These are synthesis of the feedstock (the unspun silk dope in spiders), and synthesis of the spinning conditions (the funnel, valve, tapering duct, and <b>spigot).</b> There {{have been a number}} of different approaches.|$|E
25|$|Springs {{are often}} used as sources for bottled waters. Tap water, {{delivered}} by domestic water systems in developed nations, refers to water piped to homes and delivered to a tap or <b>spigot.</b> For these water sources to be consumed safely they must receive adequate treatment and meet drinking water regulations.|$|E
25|$|The final {{length is}} the {{tapering}} duct, {{the site of}} most of the fibre formation. This consists of a tapering tube with several tight about turns, a valve almost at the end (mentioned in detail at point No. 5 below) ending in a <b>spigot</b> from which the solid silk fibre emerges. The tube here tapers hyperbolically, therefore the unspun silk is under constant elongational shear stress, which {{is an important factor in}} fibre formation. This section of the duct is lined with cells that exchange ions, reduce the dope pH from neutral to acidic, and remove water from the fibre. Collectively, the shear stress and the ion and pH changes induce the liquid silk dope to undergo a phase transition and condense into a solid protein fibre with high molecular organisation. The <b>spigot</b> at the end has lips that clamp around the fibre, controlling fibre diameter and further retaining water.|$|E

25|$|Grain Fort's initial {{armament}} {{consisted of}} 13 heavy RMLs (six 11-inch, four 9-inch and three 64-pdr. guns). By {{the end of}} the 19th century these had been replaced by four much more powerful guns: two 9.2-inch Mark X breech-loading guns and two 4.7-inch guns. The original thirteen emplacements were reduced to five by 1895. The fort continued in use during the Second World War and underwent further alterations when its two existing 6-inch close defence guns were enclosed within bomb-proof shelters. Fire control positions were also added, along with <b>spigot</b> mortars {{at each end of the}} terreplein. In 1956 the fort was decommissioned and sold to the local authority five years later, following which the surface buildings were demolished.|$|E
50|$|The {{cribellum}} is a silk spinning organ {{found in}} certain spiders. Unlike normal spinnerets, the cribellum consists {{of one or}} more plates covered in thousands of tiny <b>spigots.</b> These <b>spigots</b> produce extremely fine fibers which are combed out by the spider's calamistrum, producing silk with a wooly texture. The fibers are so small in diameter that prey insects easily become entangled in them, without any glue needed. The spiders then bite them before they can escape.|$|R
50|$|To send a message, {{the sending}} {{operator}} {{would use a}} torch to signal the receiving operator; once the two were synchronized, they would simultaneously open the <b>spigots</b> {{at the bottom of}} their containers. Water would drain out until the water level reached the desired code, at which point the sender would lower his torch, and the operators would simultaneously close their <b>spigots.</b> Thus the length of time the sender's torch was visible could be correlated with specific predetermined codes and messages.|$|R
