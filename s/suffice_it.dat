25|$|The {{catalyst}} protonates the Alkenes (Propene, Butene) {{to produce}} reactive carbocations, which Alkylate Isobutane. The reaction {{is carried out}} at mild temperatures (0 and 30nbsp&°C) in a two-phase reaction. Because the reaction is exothermic, cooling is needed: SAAU plants require lower temperatures so the cooling medium needs to be chilled, for HFAU normal refinery cooling water will <b>suffice.</b> <b>It</b> {{is important to keep}} a high ratio of Isobutane to Alkene at the point of reaction to prevent side reactions which produces a lower octane product, so the plants have a high recycle of Isobutane back to feed. The phases separate spontaneously, so the acid phase is vigorously mixed with the hydrocarbon phase to create sufficient contact surface.|$|E

[...] Senior Vice President Joel Stillerman ascribed that much of its success came from the storytelling presented in the episode; [...] "The Walking Dead is that rare piece of programming that works on so many levels.

Speaking {{of the first two}} episodes, Mark Hughes of Forbes added additional praise, saying, [...] "Quite simply, in Daredevil Marvel delivers one of the greatest live-action superhero origin stories ever made. It is in the same top-tier category of true superhero origin films along with Batman Begins, Iron Man, and [...]" [...] Hughes stated that if the first two episodes were released in theaters with only minor tweaks, they [...] "would’ve been hailed as one of Marvel’s best films to date." [...] Mike Hale at the New York Times was less positive about the series, calling it ordinary, but admitting having high expectations due to his love for the comics, and admiring the care and seriousness with which the series was made. He called the series pace [...] "leisurely", but [...] "a pleasant change from the norm", and called Cox's performance [...] "divided", praising him as Murdock and criticizing him as Daredevil. Hale was positive about the cast overall, and ultimately surmised that after seeing the first five episodes, Daredevil is [...] "eminently watchable", but not the Daredevil he remembered from the comics.|$|E
