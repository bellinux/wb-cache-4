A week later, Suzuki released her second studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol. 1, which sold 1,063,000 copies and debuted at number one.　Suzuki has said {{of this first}} period of her career {{that she was not}} free to do what she wanted and only followed what she was told, leaving her feeling [...] "pretty disheartened and down, like there was no future.". Suzuki had been writing lyrics from an early age and passing them to her manager and producers. The first song to feature them, with the help of Mitsuko and Tetsuya Komuro, was her tenth Sony single, [...] "Don't Need to <b>Say</b> <b>Good</b> Bye". The lyrics were influenced by events occurring in her personal life at that time, specifically her upcoming high school graduation and she has said [...] "it was more important to me than sales and chart rankings to know that I had put my thoughts and feelings into what I was singing."　Three months after Infinity Eighteen Vol.1, Suzuki released her twelfth single, [...] "Thank You 4 Every Day Every Body" [...] in the beginning of April and third studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol.2 at the end of April.

2500|$|The OVA {{received}} mixed reviews.

Anime News Network's Theron Martin rated it as a B, describing it as [...] "a sharp, great-looking series which mixes shojo elements with sometimes intensely graphic violence, but this was not a production meant to stand on its own." [...] Martin noted that Yuki's interpretation of Judeo-Christian elements had the potential to be offensive to Christian or Jewish viewers. Rating it one out of five stars, Dave Merrill of Anime Jump criticized Angel Sanctuary as a [...] "pretentious, confusing claptrap", and found the inclusion of incest objectionable. Aimée Schafer of THEM Anime Reviews rated it similarly, and criticized Sara and Setsuna's relationship as [...] "completely unnecessary and totally ruined what could otherwise have been a solid and, I dare <b>say,</b> <b>good</b> story." ...|$|E

He thought Randolph was especially attentive to him at dinner and that Joe found him boisterous: [...] "He must have fancied me (from the racket I was making) {{as a sort of}} free-and-easy Hercules..., if not as the whole football squad rolled into one." [...] Cope tried not to shake Joe's hand too vigorously, but Joe [...] "took all I gave and even seemed to hang on for a little more."(63) He notices Joe indicate by glances to Mrs. Phillips that he is disappointed Cope does not sing on this occasion. Randolph walks Cope home and then ends the evening, in Cope's words, [...] "taking my hand to <b>say</b> <b>good</b> night and taking his own time in dropping it."(66) In a letter, Cope urges his friend Arthur Lemoyne to leave Winnebago and come to live with him: [...] "...we can go into quarters together: a real bed instead of an upholstered shelf and a closet big enough for two wardrobes."(67) Randolph visits Cope in his modest rooms and Cope finds him not at all judgmental. Cope returns the visit and they discuss the authors of Shakespeare's plays. Randolph takes Cope to dinner and the theater. When Cope declines alcohol, Randolph feels [...] "like a corrupter of youth,"(74) but he is pleased that Cope treats him as a peer and never calls him [...] "sir." ...|$|E

2500|$|Madjo joined Crawley Town on 28 June 2007, signing {{alongside}} Jon-Paul Pittman and Tyrone Thompson. He scored {{twice on}} his debut in Crawley's {{first game of}} the 2007–08 season, a 2–1 home win against Stevenage. The following week, Madjo scored again, this time in a 4–1 away loss at Salisbury City. In September 2007, Madjo scored in five consecutive fixtures, including a brace in a 5–3 home win against Woking. He also scored twice within the space of a week in October 2007, scoring in away fixtures against Kidderminster Harriers and Weymouth respectively. Madjo had scored 11 goals in 18 games, which prompted speculation regarding a move into the Football League. Madjo said [...] "It is nice to have people <b>say</b> <b>good</b> things about you but at the moment I'm not thinking about other clubs. All I think about is doing my job and doing my best for Crawley". On 21 November 2007, four days after earning a call up to the Cameroon squad, Madjo joined League One side Cheltenham Town on a one-month loan, with a view to a permanent move. On Madjo's departure, Crawley Town manager Steve Evans said [...] "As a manager, I'm extremely disappointed. As a club, we always knew this day would come. He's an exceptional talent and a model professional". Madjo made his Cheltenham debut on 25 November 2007, coming on as a 77th-minute substitute in Cheltenham's [...] "shock" [...] 1–0 home victory over Leeds United. He started his first game three weeks later, a 1–0 win against Luton Town. During his one-month loan spell, Madjo made five appearances for Cheltenham. Despite impressing Cheltenham manager Keith Downing, the club opted against buying the player on a permanent basis as a result of Downing having more funds at his disposal – [...] "Madjo had done nothing but impress all those at Cheltenham, but thanks to the extra money made available to Keith Downing, Cheltenham have set their requirements higher".|$|E
