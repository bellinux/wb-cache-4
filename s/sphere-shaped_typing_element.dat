40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an improved}} three dimensional finite-element (3 D-FE) computational approach for magnetostatic field problems using unconstrained {{magnetic vector potential}} (MVP) formulation in conjunction with hexahedral <b>type</b> <b>elements.</b> It {{was found that the}} use of first order or second order hexahedral <b>type</b> <b>element</b> in the FE formulation eliminates the sensitivity of the FE computational results to grid geometries and elemental shape ill-conditioning associated with first order tetrahedral <b>type</b> <b>elements.</b> The method is shown to be computationally economical and is highly recommended for large scale global type 3 D magnetostatic field computations in electrical devices...|$|R

50|$|The console {{typewriter}} used an IBM Selectric mechanism, {{which meant}} one {{could change the}} type by replacing a hollow, golf-ball sized <b>type</b> <b>element.</b> There was a special <b>type</b> <b>element</b> available for APL, a powerful array-oriented programming language using a special symbolic notation.

5000|$|Many {{electric}} typewriters such as IBM Electric or Underwood Electric made {{carriage return}} {{to be another}} key on the keyboard instead of a lever. The key was usually labeled [...] "carriage return", [...] "return", or [...] "power return". With typewriters like the Selectric, where the <b>type</b> <b>element</b> moved when <b>typing</b> and the paper was held stationary, the key returned the <b>type</b> <b>element</b> to the far left and the term [...] "carrier return" [...] was sometimes used for this function.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, {{the term}} [...] "carriage return" [...] {{referred}} to a mechanism or lever on a typewriter. For machines where the <b>type</b> <b>element</b> was fixed and the paper held in a moving carriage, this lever was operated after typing a line of text to cause the carriage {{to return to the}} far right so the <b>type</b> <b>element</b> would be aligned to {{the left side of the}} paper. The lever would also usually feed the paper to advance to the next line.|$|R

2500|$|Instead of the [...] "basket" [...] of {{individual}} typebars that swung up {{to strike the}} ribbon and page in a traditional typewriter, the Selectric had a <b>type</b> <b>element</b> (frequently called a [...] "typeball", or more informally, a [...] "golf ball") that rotated and pivoted to the correct position before striking. The <b>type</b> <b>element</b> could be easily changed so as to print different fonts in the same document, resurrecting a capability that had been pioneered by the Blickensderfer typewriter almost 70 years before.

The sum of the weighted inputs is the required movement of the <b>typing</b> <b>element.</b> There are two sets of similar mechanisms, one for tilt, one for rotate. [...] The <b>type</b> <b>element</b> has four rows of 22 characters. [...] By tilting and rotating the element to the location of a character, the element can be thrust against the ribbon and platen, leaving an imprint of the chosen character.|$|R
