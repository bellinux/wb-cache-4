25|$|When Windows 95 started up, MS-DOS loaded, {{processed}} CONFIG.SYS, launched COMMAND.COM, ran AUTOEXEC.BAT {{and finally}} ran WIN.COM. The WIN.COM program used MS-DOS {{to load the}} virtual machine manager, read SYSTEM.INI, load the virtual device drivers, and then turn off any running copies of EMM386 and switch into protected mode. Once in protected mode, the virtual device drivers (VxDs) transferred all state information from MS-DOS to the 32-bit file <b>system</b> <b>manager,</b> and then shut off MS-DOS. These VxDs allow Windows 9x to interact with hardware resources directly, as providing low-level functionalities such as 32-bit disk access and memory management. All future file system operations would get routed to the 32-bit file <b>system</b> <b>manager.</b> In Windows ME, win.com was no longer executed during the startup process; instead it went directly to execute VMM32.VXD from IO.SYS.|$|E

2500|$|The second role of MS-DOS (as the 16-bit legacy {{device driver}} layer) {{was as a}} {{backward}} compatibility tool for running DOS programs in Windows. Many MS-DOS programs and device drivers interacted with DOS in a low-level way; for example, by patching low-level BIOS interrupts such as int 13h, the low-level disk I/O interrupt. When a program issued an int 21h call to access MS-DOS, the call would go first to the 32-bit file <b>system</b> <b>manager,</b> which would attempt to detect this sort of patching. If it detects that the program has tried to hook into DOS, it will jump back into the 16-bit code to let the hook run. A 16-bit driver called IFSMGR.SYS would previously have been loaded by CONFIG.SYS, the job of which was to hook MS-DOS first before the other drivers and programs got a chance, then jump from 16-bit code back into 32-bit code, when the DOS program had finished, to let the 32-bit file <b>system</b> <b>manager</b> continue its work. According to Windows developer Raymond Chen, [...] "MS-DOS was just an extremely elaborate decoy. Any 16-bit drivers and programs would patch or hook {{what they thought was}} the real MS-DOS, but which was in reality just a decoy. If the 32-bit file <b>system</b> <b>manager</b> detected that somebody bought the decoy, it told the decoy to quack.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{studies of}} {{information}} systems planning practices in organizations indicate that wide variations exist. We propose and test a model based on agency theory and transaction-costs economics to account for these variations. As senior management's uncertainty {{with respect to the}} information systems function increases, we argue they will delegate more decision rights to the information <b>systems</b> <b>manager.</b> As a result of increased agency costs, senior management will demand more information systems planning to provide the basis for monitoring and bonding of the manager. In addition, because information systems plans may be used to resolve the distribution of gains and losses between senior management and the information <b>systems</b> <b>manager</b> in the event of unforeseen circumstances, both senior management and the information <b>systems</b> <b>manager</b> will seek to exercise control over the planning process and the form of the final plan. We argue that the relative specialization of human capital of senior management versus the information <b>systems</b> <b>manager</b> will dictate whose views dominate in the preparation of and form of the information systems plan. Our empirical results show moderate support for our model. information systems planning, agency theory, transaction-costs economics, contingency models of planning...|$|R
