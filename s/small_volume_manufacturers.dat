40|$|The use {{of plants}} as {{heterologous}} hosts {{is one of}} the most promising technologies for manufacturing valuable recombinant proteins. Plant seeds, in particular, constitute ideal production platforms for long-term applications requiring a steady supply of starting material, as they combine the general advantages of plants as bioreactors with the possibility of biomass storage for long periods in a relatively <b>small</b> <b>volume,</b> thus allowing <b>manufacturers</b> to decouple upstream and downstream processing. In the present work we have used transgenic tobacco seeds to produce large amounts of a functionally active mouse monoclonal antibody against the Hepatitis B Virus surface antigen, fused to a KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retrieval motif, under control of regulatory sequences from common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) seed storage proteins. The antibody accumulated to levels of 6. 5 mg/g of seed in the T 3 generation, and was purified by Protein A affinity chromatography combined with SEC-HPLC. N-glycan analysis indicated that, despite the KDEL signal, the seed-derived plantibody bore both high-mannose and complex-type sugars that indicate partial passage through the Golgi compartment, although its performance in the immunoaffinity purification of HBsAg was unaffected. An analysis discussing the industrial feasibility of replacing the currently used tobacco leaf-derived plantibody with this seed-derived variant is also presented...|$|R
40|$|The Board’s {{approval}} provides {{relief to}} the <b>small</b> <b>volume</b> <b>manufacturers</b> of high performance sterndrive and inboard engines (those with rated power greater than 373 kilowatts) {{by allowing them to}} certify engines to less stringent exhaust standards than would have otherwise been required under the existing regulation (i. e., 5. 0 grams per kilowatt-hour combined hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen (g/kW-hr HC+NOx)). However, to preserve the emission benefits of the existing regulation, high performance engines must not exceed 16. 0 g/kW-hr HC+NOx and may only be installed in boats with enhanced evaporative control capability that includes activated carbon canisters. Large volume manufacturers of high performance engines must continue to comply with the catalyst-based 5. 0 g/kW-hr HC+NOx exhaust standard and must also ensure that their engines are installed in boats with enhanced evaporative control capability. The Board approved additional provisions allowing manufacturers greater flexibility in complyin...|$|E

40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>volume</b> provers and {{associated}} technology {{have been in}} use throughout the world by weights and measures jurisdictions and industry for meter verification (pulse-generating meters) since the 1980 ’s. However, field standard test measures and large volume graduated neck-type provers, as described in NBS Handbook 105 - 3, are most commonly used as field standards by weights and measures officials in the United States. The American Petroleum Institute (API) documented the proper design and use of <b>small</b> <b>volume</b> provers in 1988 : “Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards, ” Chapter 4, Proving Systems, Section 3, <b>Small</b> <b>Volume</b> Provers, and Section 6, Pulse Interpolation. These publications should be referred to for additional information. A major effort was undertaken by Brooks Instruments in 1992 to obtain recognition of the <b>small</b> <b>volume</b> prover as a field standard. Subsequent field tests were conducted, calibration procedures were developed, and Examination Procedure Outlines for meter verification were modified to address unique capabilities of the <b>small</b> <b>volume</b> prover. This publication {{is the result of}} a draft prepared by Timothy W. Scott of Brooks Instruments in 1994. Favorable results have been achieved through comparison between graduated neck-type provers and <b>small</b> <b>volume</b> provers when used in meter verification. Improvements in the volume measurement system in the United States may be possible through the use of <b>small</b> <b>volume</b> prover technology over the use of graduated neck-type provers. Improvements have been suggested in the following areas...|$|R

40|$|It is {{recognised}} by the European Governments {{that the}} economic growth and the future wealth of the EU will be significantly determined {{by the development of}} the Small and Medium sized Enterprise (SME) sector of the economy and recent EU programs have been tailored to support SMEs in technical innovation and encourage commercial exploitation. The main obstacles to this development are the cost of the silicon access and intellectual property rights. The expansion of microelectronics in the SME sector, facilitated by MPC Services leads to a requirement for <b>small</b> <b>volume</b> production, as well as prototyping. Very often, semiconductor manufacturers are reluctant to provide <b>small</b> <b>volumes</b> because of the low return, so the MPC Service has to cover the range from prototyping to the relatively high <b>volumes</b> that the <b>manufacturers</b> will handle directly. This level varies between manufacturers. Also mixing prototyping and <b>small</b> <b>volume</b> production can give rise to an attractive cost model, giving low cost prototypes and low cost <b>small</b> <b>volume.</b> CMP in Grenoble {{is one of the major}} centres in the world to have developed a service specially dedicated for low volume production for SMEs. The commercial aspect of IP in embedded systems is a new subject, and so there is little or no directly applicable support in Europe. Some support for the legal aspects of the licensing phase may be available through the Licensing Executive Society (LES). The commercial aspects are, however, at least as big a problem as reported in many studies and workshops. IPRIAS Ltd is an example of a new type of consultancy which offers a full service to the SME wishing to exploit their IPR, bringing together the commercial and legal aspects into a " one-stop-shop ". Recently CMP has joined its technical skills with IPRIAS to facilitated access to microelectronics for SMEs...|$|R
