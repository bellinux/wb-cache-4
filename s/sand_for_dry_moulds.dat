30|$|However, {{some studies}} {{indicated}} that silt content in sand increases the liquefaction potential [13, 14] and other specified that the resistance initially decreases as the silt content increases thereafter increases as the silt content {{continues to increase}} [15]. Besides, Kuerbis et al. [16] concluded {{that the presence of}} fines in the void spaces makes the soil slightly more dilative. Belkhatir et al. [17, 18] imply that the strength silty sand up to 50 % fines content is less then that of the clean <b>sand</b> <b>for</b> constant <b>dry</b> density approach. Dash and Sitharam [19, 20] proposed that the strength parameter initially increases till 5 % silt content and thereafter decreases rapidly till around the limiting fines content (LFC) (explained in “Limiting fines content”) and finally remain relatively constant for all the silt contents till even pure silt at constant relative density approach, though Karim and Alam [21] found this peak (for 5 % silt content) when the specimens were prepared by air pluviation method not for moist temping method.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of composite combination {{of each of}} grades 1 and 2 Nigerian acacia species exudates and bentonite clay as sand mould binder was investigated. The study involved foundry property analyses of sand mould specimens bonded with composites mixes of grades 1 and 2 acacia species exudates and bentonite clay. Standard foundry equipment that included universal strength machine, permeability meter, hardness tester, shatter index machine and quick moisture teller in the foundry workshop and laboratory of Ajaokuta Steel Company Limited, Nigeria were used as the research equipment. The foundry properties measured were the moisture content, green and dry compressive strength, permeability and shatter index of sand moulds bonded with varied combinations of the composite materials. The result was compared to existing foundry standard and past related work. It showed that composite combination of 8 % grade 1 acacia species with 1 % bentonite clay was a suitable binder <b>for</b> green and <b>dry</b> <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> <b>for</b> casting light steel, grey iron and non-ferrous alloys. A composite of 8 % grade 2 acacia species and 1 % bentonite clay was a suitable binder <b>for</b> green and <b>dry</b> <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> <b>for</b> casting grey iron and non-ferrous alloy.

40|$|A 24 {{year old}} man {{developed}} severe asthma {{two years after}} starting {{to work in a}} plywood plant. Four years later the patient had to stop working because of the increasing severity of his asthma. Three months after leaving his job, the patient's asthma was greatly improved. His job consisted of placing plywood sheets into a drying machine. The plywood sheets had stayed outside in wet conditions for at least four to six weeks and were usually covered with <b>moulds.</b> <b>Drying</b> the plywood sheets changed the mould into a fine orange powder. Exposure to this in the laboratory induced an isolated immediate asthmatic reaction. The same reaction was seen when the patient was challenged with an extract of the mould powder at a 0. 1 % w/v concentration. Skin prick test with the mould extract induced a weal and flare reaction and IgE antibodies against the <b>dry</b> <b>mould</b> powder were identified. A control patient with the same degree of bronchial hyperreactivity did not have any asthmatic reaction when challenged with the same mould extract.

40|$|Laboratory {{ultrasonic}} {{experiments were}} made on artificial soil samples in order to observe the effects of slight overburden, sand/clay ratio and pore fluid saturation on compressional and shear wave velocities. Up to several meters of overburden were simulated by applying low uniaxial stress of about 0. 1 MPa to a restrained sample. Samples were fabricated from Ottawa sand mixed with a swelling clay (Wyoming bentonite). The amount of clay added was 1 to 40 percent by mass. Most measurements were made under room-dry conditions, but some measurements were made for fully-saturated sand-clay mixtures and <b>for</b> partially-saturated <b>sand</b> samples. <b>For</b> the <b>dry</b> sand-clay samples, compressional (P) velocities were low, ranging from about 200 to 500 m/s for the mixtures at low stress. Shear (S) velocities were {{about half of the}} compressional velocity, about 70 to 250 m/s. Dramatic increases in all velocities occurred with small uniaxial loads, indicating strong nonlinearity. Composition and grain packing control the mechanical response at grain contacts and the resulting nonlinear response at low stresses. P and S velocities are sensitive to the amount of clay added, even at low concentrations. At these low equivalent overburden conditions, adhesion and capillarity at grain contacts affect wave amplitudes, velocities, and frequency content in the partial saturation case...|$|R

40|$|Mandheling coffee {{has been}} a well known {{specialty}} coffees for decades {{and the demand for}} this coffee is currently increasing. This coffee is characterised by low acidity, heavy-complex body, spicy-little earthy and fruity flavor. Mandheling coffee is produced by smallholder farmers in the highland surrounding Lake TobaNorth Sumatra in an unique way i. e. following de-pulping and 1 – 2 days sundrying, wet parchment is stored for varying periods up to a few weeks, the parchments are then de-hulled when still wet (40 – 45 % moisture content) then the beans sundried. The handling procedure presumably contributes to the unique cup character of Mandheling coffee. On the other hand the storage of wet pachments may cause mould growth and mycotoxin contamination. This trial was designed to study the influence of storage of wet parchments prior to wet hulling on mould development, OTA contamination and cup Mandheling characteristic of the coffee product. The normal wet process, drying of parchment thoroughly to 12 % moisture content was used as the control. Parchment coffees (6 lots) used for this trial were drawn from farmers and collectors in the region. The wet parchments (41. 74 – 53. 96 % moisture content) were stored for 1 (D 1), 7 (D 7) and 14 (D 14) days in PE sacks in a warehouse in the region. During the storage period, when there was visible mould growth, the parchments were spread on a plastic sheet inside the warehouse, as per common practice to suppress the mould growth. Following storage, the wet parchment was de-hulled and then sun-dried to a moisture content of 12 % (MC 12 %) or dried to a moisture content of 17 %, and held in storage for 3 weeks prior to final drying to 12 % mc. The ‘normal wet process’ i. e. fresh-non stored parchments dried thoroughly to 12 %, were used as the control. Parameters measured were visual evaluation, mould infestation, a w, moisture content (MC) on the stored parchment; while <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> beans <b>mould</b> infestation, OTA content and the Mandheling cup character evaluation (done by 4 panelists who were familiar to the coffee) were determined. Some mould species grew during the storage course, with black Aspergillus was the dominant species found in the beans, while A. ochraceusan OTA producer, was found in some samples with low infection rate (0 – 15. 3 %). Spreading of coffee inside the warehouse during the day could suppress moulds growth. OTA was found in only 5 samples out of 42 samples with range of 0. 17 – 2. 24 ppb, very less than European Union limit. There was no clear trend of storage period on the mould infection rates, OTA content, and the Mandheling cup characters. The high variability of the outcome was likely due to the inhomogenity of parchments used for this trial. The best Mandheling was found in the sample of D 1 -MC 12 %-coffee source of lot 1.
