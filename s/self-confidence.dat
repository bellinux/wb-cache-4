5|$|Acton's severe {{judgement}} did {{not deter}} Waugh from {{his intention to}} be a writer, but it affected his belief that he could succeed as a novelist. For a time {{he turned his attention}} away from fiction, but with the gradual recovery of his <b>self-confidence</b> he was able to complete his first novel, Decline and Fall, which was published with great success in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Arnhem {{restored}} much of Model's <b>self-confidence,</b> {{which had}} been shaken by the experience of Normandy. From September to December, he fought another Allied thrust to a standstill, this time by Omar Bradley's U.S. 12th Army Group into the Hürtgen Forest and Aachen. While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of his units than at Arnhem, he still kept himself fully informed on the situation, slowing the Allies' progress, inflicting heavy casualties and taking {{full advantage of the}} fortifications of the Westwall, known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1934, Himmler oversaw the {{creation}} of SS-Junkerschule (Junker schools), institutions where SS officer candidates received leadership training, political and ideological indoctrination, and military instruction. The training stressed ruthlessness and toughness as part of the SS value system, which helped foster a sense of superiority among the men and taught them <b>self-confidence.</b> The first schools were established at Bad Tölz and Braunschweig, with additional schools opening at Klagenfurt and Prague during the war.|$|E

5|$|Mark's father {{remarried}} {{and raised}} them strictly, seeking to influence {{them to become}} leaders. Throughout his childhood and teenage years, Mark's father would have him combine athletic and mental training. Mark would have to dribble a basketball without looking at it while reciting multiplication tables; practice baseball swings in a batting cage while answering questions about the periodic table and similar combined drills that his father hoped would develop quick thinking and <b>self-confidence</b> that would guide Mark {{in all areas of}} life and not simply sports.|$|E
5|$|Social conditions, the {{standard}} of living and the <b>self-confidence</b> of the workers gradually improved due to industrialization between 1870–1916, but while {{the standard}} of living rose among the common people, the rift between rich and poor deepened markedly. The commoners' rising awareness of the socioeconomic and political questions interacted with the ideas of socialism, social liberalism and nationalism (Fennomania). The workers' responses and the corresponding counteracts of the dominating upper factions steepened the social relations in Finland.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} his {{marriage}} and the defeats of the Holy League diminished Sigismund's <b>self-confidence.</b> He sent his envoys to RudolphII and again offered to abdicate in September 1597. An agreement regarding his abdication was signed on 23December 1597. RudolphII granted Sigismund the Silesian duchies of Racibórz and Opole and a yearly subsidy of 50,000 thalers. The agreement was kept secret for months.|$|E
5|$|While Tucker {{began writing}} for publication, as an {{attorney}} he was initially deficient, being disabled by his fear of speaking in the courtroom; he later gained the requisite <b>self-confidence.</b> Tucker became {{a founding member of}} the Virginia Historical and Philosophical Society in Richmond, an effort led by John Marshall and John Floyd; Tucker was named to the Society's Standing Committee.|$|E
5|$|Genevieve Lhermitte {{was born}} on November 16, 1966 in Brussels to Michel Lhermitte, a {{businessman}} and student, and Marina Schoevaert, a nurse. Lhermitte had two younger sisters: Catherine in 1969, and Mireille in 1972. Though she struggled with her coursework and <b>self-confidence</b> during her secondary studies, Lhermitte graduated in 1991 with a diploma in French and History from the Educational Institute of Social Promotion of the French Community (IEPSCF) in Uccle. It was during the 1988-1989 year at IEPSCF that Lhermitte met her future husband, Bouchaib Moqadem, who was studying mathematics and physics but did not complete his studies.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{graduated}} from Harvard Law School in 1896 {{at the age}} of 24. He returned to Albany to live with his mother and aunt, and started work for the law firm in which an uncle, Matthew Hale, was a partner. Hale's unexpected death a few months later obliged Hand to move to a new firm, but by 1899, he had become a partner. He had difficulty attracting his own clients, however, and found the work trivial and dull. Much of his time was spent researching and writing briefs, with few opportunities for the appellate work he preferred. His early courtroom appearances, when they came, were frequently difficult, sapping his fragile <b>self-confidence.</b> He began to fear that he lacked the ability to think on his feet in court.|$|E
5|$|In April 1922, Kenyatta began a job {{working as}} a stores clerk and meter reader for Cook, who had been {{appointed}} water superintendent for the Nairobi municipal council. In this position he earned 250 shillings a month, a particularly high wage for a native African, which brought him financial independence and {{a growing sense of}} <b>self-confidence.</b> Kenyatta lived in Kilimani, although financed the construction of a second home at Dagoretti; he referred to this latter hut as the Kinyata Stores for he used it to hold general provisions for the neighbourhood. He had sufficient funds that he could lend money to European clerks in the offices, and could enjoy the lifestyle offered by Nairobi, which included cinemas, football matches, and imported British fashions.|$|E
5|$|People of {{all ages}} with {{physical}} and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from association with horses. Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased <b>self-confidence,</b> and a greater feeling of freedom and independence. The benefits of equestrian activity {{for people with disabilities}} has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the Paralympic Games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). Hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.|$|E
5|$|The {{new focus}} was on women's self-discovery; and the ACWF {{launched}} the Four Self Campaign consisting of: self-respect, <b>self-confidence,</b> self-improvement, and self-reliance. An example of the ACWF balancing its government responsibilities with its responsibility to the women of China {{can be seen in}} the One-Child Policy. The ACWF was responsible for publicizing the policy and its content, but questioned if the policy respected the rights of women. In the end, the ACWF settled on requesting that its cadres comply with the law to set a good example for the country, to promote the One-Child policy to the Chinese women, and to strongly condemn any coercive action related to the policy.|$|E
5|$|Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, {{the main}} heroine of Clannad, {{at the onset}} of the story. Nagisa is a shy, soft-spoken girl who has very low {{self-esteem}} and <b>self-confidence</b> which causes her to rely on those around her for support. She has developed the strange habit of muttering the names of favorite foods that she plans to eat as a way to motivate herself, such as anpan. Kyou Fujibayashi, another of Clannad heroines, is an aggressive girl well known as a good cook among her friends and family. When angry she does not hesitate to throw a dictionary at people that she often carries around for such purposes. Despite this attitude, she also has a more subdued side, especially towards her younger fraternal twin sister Ryou Fujibayashi.|$|E
5|$|According to Sarma, Gandhi {{recruited}} {{women to}} participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new <b>self-confidence</b> and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield. When women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.|$|E
5|$|At the season's second race (at Rockingham Speedway), {{she started}} second but {{finished}} 36th after {{being involved in}} a crash. Two races later, Robinson won her first career pole position (and the first for {{a woman in the}} Busch Series) in the Busch Light 300 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. On the race's first lap, she battled with Joe Nemechek and Mike Wallace through the track's third turn when Wallace collided with Robinson which sent her into Nemechek. Robinson continued with heavy damage to the front-end of her car, but retired after completing 63 laps with radiator damage. She attempted to qualify for the Busch North Series race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway but did not record a fast enough lap time to start the race. Robinson achieved her first top-ten finish in the Busch Series later in the season with a tenth-place result in the Fay's 150 at Watkins Glen. However, she was released from the team shortly afterward due to a loss of sponsorship, and ended the year 47th overall. Robinson took time off to rebuild her psyche and <b>self-confidence,</b> and worked on interior decorating as a hobby. She married engine builder Jeff Clark in November 1994.|$|E
5|$|Broken and depressed, Meghna {{lives in}} Chandigarh {{for over a}} year. Her father {{encourages}} her to return to Mumbai; Meghna rekindles her friendship with Janet and models for Rohit's show, where she freezes on the ramp after seeing the lights and cameras. She visits Maanav (now an established model) to apologize and learns that he is engaged. Shonali appears on television as a mentally ill, homeless alcoholic; Meghna takes her in and tries to rehabilitate her. Meghna accepts an offer from Rahul to model, but a day before the show Shonali vanishes. Just before Meghna walks the ramp, she receives {{a call from the}} police telling her that Shonali is dead from a drug overdose. Meghna freezes; overcoming her grief, she walks the ramp, reviving her career and restoring her <b>self-confidence.</b> Meghna gives up drinking and smoking, and as the film closes she walks the ramp in Paris.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the bicycle kick would again be brought forth to {{international}} acclaim by Pelé. Pelé's capability to perform bicycle kicks with ease was one of the traits that made him stand out from other players early in his sports career, and it also boosted his <b>self-confidence</b> as a footballer. After Pelé, Argentine midfielder Diego Maradona and Mexican forward Hugo Sánchez became notable performers of the bicycle kick during the last decades of the 20th century. Other notable players to have performed the move during this period include Peruvian winger Juan Carlos Oblitas, who scored a bicycle kick goal in a 1975 Copa América match between Peru and Chile, and Welsh forward Mark Hughes, who scored from a bicycle kick in a World Cup qualification match played between Wales and Spain in 1985.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, Fillmore turned 21 and {{was thus}} legally {{independent}} of his father. He taught school in East Aurora, and accepted {{a few cases}} in {{justice of the peace}} courts, which did not require the practitioner to be a licensed attorney. He moved to Buffalo the following year, continued his study of law, first while teaching school, and then in the law office of Asa Rice and Joseph Clary; he also became engaged to Abigail Powers. In 1823, he was admitted to the New York bar, and declined offers from Buffalo law firms to return to East Aurora and establish a practice as the town's only lawyer. Later in life, Fillmore stated that he initially lacked the <b>self-confidence</b> to practice in the larger city of Buffalo; his biographer, Paul Finkelman, suggested that after being under others' thumbs all his life, Fillmore enjoyed the independence of his East Aurora practice. On February 5, 1826, Millard and Abigail wed. They had two children, Millard Powers Fillmore (1828–1889) and Mary Abigail Fillmore (1832–1854).|$|E
5|$|Their fourth child, Claire, is {{delivered}} by {{a neighbor of}} the family in the lounge of their house as a hurricane is heading towards the Eastern Seaboard. The book follows the family through the 1960s and 1970s, as the children enter adolescence and discover themselves during the changing times of the 1960s and the Sexual Revolution. The Keane children, on entering early adulthood, begin to break away from their family and religious backgrounds. Jacob, the eldest child, serves in Vietnam and is killed in the French trenches. Michael moves away from Long Island and goes to study in a college in northern New York, but later turns to sex and drugs. Meanwhile, Annie, the bookworm of the family, leaves to study in England, but quickly changes her plans after meeting a man on a bus whom she likes. Claire, the youngest, returns from a summer vacation to her former Catholic high school, showing a changed personality and increased <b>self-confidence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Well {{established}} in the imperial capital, Honório Hermeto campaigned in 1829 to become a general deputy (member of the Chamber of Deputies, the national lower house) as a representative for his native Minas Gerais. He was elected to {{a seat in the}} legislature for the term beginning April 1830. He {{became a member of the}} Liberal Party, which stood in opposition to PedroI and his policies. As a general deputy, Honório Hermeto had an unobtrusive role for the first couple of years, having been overshadowed by Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, the leader of the deputies representing Minas Gerais. Short, slim and with a speech impediment, the dark-haired Honório Hermeto appeared an unimpressive figure at first glance. Like his father, he was headstrong, opinionated and often scathing. However, he had <b>self-confidence</b> and a powerful charisma, and was energetic, intelligent, perspicacious and a natural born leader.|$|E
5|$|Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky {{was educated}} {{for a career}} as a civil servant. There was scant {{opportunity}} for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's <b>self-confidence.</b> Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased <b>self-confidence</b> and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E
5|$|On their journey, they {{encounter}} Phineas, the blind human who helped Jason, {{leader of the}} Argonauts on his journey, and befriend a harpy named Ella that supposedly torments him. They also see the three Cyclopes that Jason Grace, Piper McLean, and Leo Valdez encountered in The Lost Hero. During the trip, the trio learns that the goddess Gaea is awakening from several millennia of slumber {{with a plan to}} destroy the gods and the world along with them. Her seven Giant children are being woken, each of whom is matched to fight a their counterpart god. Each Giant has the skills to oppose one god and they can only be defeated if the gods and the demigods join forces. This proves to be difficult. Percy and his friends manage to defeat the Alaskan Giant and save Camp Jupiter from destruction. During their journey, Hazel and Frank become true heroes who know how to use their powers and have <b>self-confidence.</b> Percy regains his memory on their return to Camp Jupiter and finds an army of monsters (including Stheno, Euryale, and the three Cyclopes) led by Polybotes attacking it. Percy successfully defeats him with the help of Terminus, his Cyclops half-brother, Tyson and the hellhound, Mrs. O'Leary. At the end of the book, the Greek airship, Argo II arrives setting up the plot for The Mark of Athena.|$|E

25|$|Another {{factor that}} contributed to Brahms's perfectionism was Schumann's early enthusiasm, which Brahms was {{determined}} to live up to. Schumann's early approbation was {{a challenge to the}} composer's <b>self-confidence,</b> and {{may have contributed to the}} delay in producing the First Symphony.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to individual psychotherapy, both group psychotherapy and self-help, or support groups, {{can be an}} effective line of treatment for dysthymia as well.

25|$|Medical {{literature}} states, {{and studies}} show, that punishing or shaming {{a child for}} bedwetting will frequently make the situation worse. Doctors describe a downward cycle where a child punished for bedwetting feels shame {{and a loss of}} <b>self-confidence.</b> This can cause increased bedwetting incidents, leading to more punishment and shaming.|$|E
25|$|Boldness. Low fear {{including}} stress-tolerance, toleration of unfamiliarity and danger, {{and high}} <b>self-confidence</b> and social assertiveness.
