According to a MTV News staff report, [...] "Lohan {{missed the}} cue to mouth along, forcing cameras {{to cut away}} when her mouth remained closed as she was heard singing, thanks to a backing track." [...] A representative for Lohan, however, revealed that the singer actually sang it live, and noted that Lohan only used a background track [...] "to help make the song <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> does on her album." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Jon Stone, {{talking about}} the music of Sesame Street, said: [...] "There was no other <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> on television". For {{the first time in}} children's television, the show's songs {{fulfilled}} a specific purpose and supported its curriculum. In order to attract the best composers and lyricists, the CTW allowed songwriters like Sesame Streets first musical director Joe Raposo to retain the rights to the songs they wrote, which earned them lucrative profits and helped the show sustain public interest. By 1991, Sesame Street and its songwriters had received eight Grammys.|$|E
500|$|... "Feedback" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins and D'Mile, with additional writing from Tasleema Yasin and LaShawn Daniels. It saw Jackson returning to an experimental dance-pop sound {{in contrast to}} the subdued rhythmic feel of prior album 20 Y.O. The song was her first single released via the Island label after departing with Virgin Records. Island's A director likened its drum pattern to [...] "Rhythm Nation", though clarified, [...] "it doesn't <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> It's a 2008 version." [...] The song leaked on December 12, 2007 and was premiered by New York radio station Z100 the same day.|$|E

500|$|This remix {{received}} overwhelmingly negative {{reviews from}} music critics. Randall Roberts, Los Angeles Times Pop Music Critic, {{said the new}} remixes on Bad 25 were [...] "terrible... and are an insult to MJ's memory not because they rework his music, but because they do it so ungracefully." [...] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters said [...] "Afrojack has two remixes of [...] "Bad" [...] here, obviously {{trying to make the}} song <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> belongs on modern-day radio (one of them, with two guest verses from Pitbull, is just outright trash)..." [...] MisterCharlie from SupaJam.com also gave it an extremely negative review. The Guardians review said it was [...] "a clubbed-up remix featuring the world's worst rapper".|$|E
500|$|The {{music on}} Sesame Street {{consisted}} of many styles and genres, but it retained its own distinctive sound, which was consistent and recognizable {{so that it}} could be reproduced. [...] "There was no other <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> on television", Jon Stone, the show's first director, said. [...] Music was used to encourage children's dual-attention abilities by allowing them to attend to the show's action even when not actively watching. In order to be effective, however, Gerald S. Lesser, who supervised research for Sesame Street, stated that because music and sound effects naturally evokes physical participation, they need to be carefully integrated with visual movement. As a result, the songwriters avoided pairing music with static visual presentations. Auditory cues in the form of music or sound effects signaled the entrance of a character or the end and beginning of a sequence.|$|E
500|$|... "Get On Top", a song which {{contains}} significant {{use of a}} wah pedal, was formed after a jam session conducted shortly after Frusciante had listened to Public Enemy: [...] "I came up with [...] {{on the way to}} rehearsal—just tapping it out with my foot." [...] The understated guitar solo played {{in the middle of the}} song was originally intended to be more noticeable, according to Frusciante, who was playing screaming guitar solos. He changed his thought process after listening to Steve Howe's guitar solo on Yes' [...] "Siberian Khatru": [...] "the band sounded really big—and they're playing really fast—and then this clean guitar solo comes out over on top. It's really beautiful, like it's on its own sort of shelf. For 'Get On Top' I wanted to play something that contrasted between the solo and the background." [...] "Savior", a song found towards the end of the album, features heavy effects, most notably an Electro-Harmonix Micro Synth with 16-second delay. Frusciante notes that the sound is [...] "directly inspired by Eric Clapton's playing in Cream. If you listen to the actual notes, they're like a Clapton solo—they just don't <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> because of the effects." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{having a}} {{potential}} contract with Apollo Records collapse when the label went bankrupt, Biondo and Dale {{decided that she}} should release her own live album. On January 2–3, 1996, the material for Live at Blues Alley was recorded at Blues Alley in Washington, DC. Due to a technical glitch {{on the first night}} of recording, only the second night's recording was usable. (The recording of the first night was eventually restored and released as Nightbird in 2015.) Unhappy with the way she sounded due to a cold, she was reluctant to release the album. She eventually relented, on the condition that the studio track [...] "Oh, Had I a Golden Thread", Cassidy's favorite song, would be included in the release, and that they start working on a follow-up studio album. Her apprehension appeared unfounded as local reviewers and the public responded positively. The Washington Post commented that [...] "she could sing anything— folk, blues, pop, jazz, R, gospel— and make it <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was the only music that mattered." [...] The subsequent studio album she worked on was released posthumously as Eva by Heart in 1997. In the liner notes of Eva by Heart, music critic Joel E. Siegel described Cassidy as [...] "one of the greatest voices of her generation." ...|$|E
500|$|Thom Jurek, a {{staff writer}} for AllMusic, gave the album a rating of three out of five stars. Jurek gave notice to the album's sound quality, telling readers that it does not [...] "capture the sheer overblown {{intensity}} of the unit in a concert setting," [...] but that it comes closer than one may imagine. Jurek also gave note to how Rick Rubin made the two-discs <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> were recorded at one gig, writing [...] "Producer Rick Rubin stays out of the way; his production seems to be in terms of shaping the live sound to make it sound like this is all one gig." [...] Entertainment Weeklys David Browne said that it was an [...] "accurate aural snapshots of what it's like {{to be part of a}} crowd craning to see the action on a stage that seems two miles away." [...] Browne also said that [...] "they're perfect examples of the sad current state of the once-proud live rock album." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a star ("Honorable Mention is a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like."), saying, [...] "praise the Lord--I can hardly understand a word they're singing (Hell Awaits)." [...] Joel McIver, author of The Bloody Reign of Slayer said that it was regarded as one of the best live albums released by a heavy metal band.|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs are}} {{selected}} as stand-outs throughout the album. [...] "Tug of War" [...] is labelled as [...] "the strongest {{song on the}} album", with John D. Luerssen writing that [...] "the cohesiveness of the material suggests the lads in Kid Kilowatt exited this side project as friends. After all, only buddies capable of putting their differences aside could craft the soaring, majestic [...] "Tug of War," [...] where Brodsky's wide-reaching pipes mesh brilliantly with KK's ace musicianship". He continues to say that [...] "the disc shifts from roaring, expansive rockers like [...] "Bicycle Song" [...] to crunching anthems like [...] "Ted Nugent" [...] and on to lilting, near-ballads like [...] "Memorial Drive" [...] with inexplicable ease". Moore writes that [...] "The Scope" [...] "encapsulates {{what the rest of}} the album will <b>sound</b> <b>like.</b> <b>It</b> starts out sounding rather crunchy and smooths out as the album progresses, providing a good contrasting effect that runs throughout the album". Moore, however, writes that [...] "Memorial Drive" [...] is [...] "only mediocre. It's the only song on the album over five minutes long. Playing slow just isn't this band's forte, although they have the ability to write poignant lyrics". Similarly, a ScenePointBlank review states that [...] "Cadence for a Rainy Day" [...] and [...] "Memorial Drive" [...] "often diverge and lead the listener off-course".|$|E

500|$|Originally {{entitled}} [...] "For Evermore", [...] "Evermore" [...] {{was written}} by composer Menken and lyricist Rice. The last of the three original songs written for the remake, [...] "Evermore" [...] was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own. Written in Spring 2015 in London, England, Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle. Actor Dan Stevens, who portrays the Beast and performs [...] "Evermore", had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film. Before [...] "Evermore" [...] was written, Condon informed Stevens {{that he would be}} singing a new song in his role as Beast. Having not sung professionally since childhood, Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice, the process of which he found challenging. To prepare for the recording, Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann-Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken. Stevens first recorded a [...] "guide track" [...] for [...] "Evermore" [...] before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes. To make the actor sound more [...] "beast-like", sound engineers digitally modified Stevens' voice, which Menken produced himself. Auto-Tune was used to make Stevens' voice sound lower and heavier. Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production. On recording a new song, Stevens said, [...] "the pressure's sort of off — but it's also on — because it doesn't have to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> did before, but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that's already pretty great." [...] Stevens agreed that the song is [...] "a big, romantic, soaring number" [...] about the Beast lamenting [...] "I've fallen in love with her, and now she's buggered off, woe is me", while [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] is [...] "How am I going {{to fall in love with}} her?" [...] Replacing [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with [...] "Evermore" [...] helped make the songwriters eligible for an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.|$|E

2500|$|With {{third album}} On Your Radar, {{the group said}} they were {{beginning}} to take risks in their music genre. They said; [...] "I think every artist needs to, sort of, reinvent themselves and we don't want any track to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> could have been on our previous albums.

[...] The band described the songs lyrics as [...] "playful" [...] with a [...] "drop-out chorus" [...] and the song is often labelled [...] "it's a very cool" [...] by the band.
