This common presumption is wrong on so many levels, because the genre of sequels has many subgenres and mixed genres and they are constantly changing {{in the light of}} the new technologies of filmmaking, TV broadcast and demands of the market. The societies in transition are subjected to various media contents among which the greatest popularity is bestowed to the melodramatic narrative of telenovelas.

At the level of cultural discourse, plastic is perceived as nearly antithetical to nature. On the other hand, beyond some basic intuition <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> a nature and <b>that</b> it can <b>be</b> identified, firmly establishing the actual referent for this concept is difficult.

40|$|Are {{securities}} markets more liquid {{when the}} economy is more liquid?

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{emergence}} of perpetual property {{in a number of}} discrete areas of property law: the longevity of servitudes in historic and environmental preservation, the ever growing time span of intellectual property rights, the disappearance of the rules against perpetual interests, and the temporally unlimited reach of cultural property claims. While the demise of temporal limitations is itself worthy of recognition and will be the focus of a significant part of this paper, my primary interest is whether these changes tell us something about shifting cultural attitudes to the institution of private property. If it is the case, as a number of prominent sociologists have argued, that an exploration of social attitudes toward time is indispensable to an understanding of our current cultural conditions then exploring temporal limitations in property law will presumably help us better understand what Professor Radin has called the “cultural commitments of property. ” This topic is particularly compelling when one considers that {{the emergence of}} perpetual property, with its assumption of stability and permanence, has occurred at a time when speed, flexibility and impermanence are dominant features of our current social conditions. The prevailing conditions in society, even a single generation into the future, are likely to be so different from today that long-term control of property seems anachronistic and paradoxical. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> it <b>that</b> in an era of rapid technological change we are more willing to tolerate perpetual property interests...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{centrality}} of energy to global and national politics, international energy governance {{remains one of the}} most fragmented areas of international cooperation. In this paper I address three question: <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> international energy governance <b>so</b> fragmented? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> fragmentation a problem? And what should we do about it? In brief, energy governance is fragmented between economic energy institutions — such as the International Energy Agency, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting States, and the Energy Charter Treaty — and environmental energy institutions such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This fragmentation, due in part to path dependence, is problematic because it creates a situation in which the policies adopted in one institution can undermine the effectiveness of policies adopted in another institution. The UNFCCC, for example, aims to create incentives for an economy-wide shift to low-carbon fuels by making low-carbon fuels cheaper relative to high-carbon fuels. Yet economic energy institutions often have the opposite objective and/or effect. The IEA and OPEC both adopt measures aimed at keeping oil competitive with low-carbon substitute fuels, thereby deterring the fuel-switching encouraged by the UNFCCC. Moreover, because economic energy institutions often set policy for only a single type of fuel (such as oil or natural gas), they greatly increase the transaction costs to bargaining over a comprehensive energy production or consumption policy. To reduce the costs of this fragmentation, I make two suggestions. First, the role of the International Energy Forum in coordinating the policies of other intergovernmental energy institutions should be amplified. Second, energy governance should in some cases be further fragmented to de-emphasize linkages that prompt political backlash during negotiations...|$|R

These numbers imply that when the sum of traffic delays accumulated by many drivers is equal in duration to the average lifetime lost in a fatal crash (37. 3 years), the cost of such delay is higher than the cost of an average lost life. Most find this to <b>be</b> disturbing. If <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> it <b>that</b> estimates of the value of time and life allegedly based on people's preferences are at odds with what most prefer? A search for the root of this problem leads to Schelling's distinction between the value of death to those who die and the value of the probability of dying to those who live. He thinks <b>that</b> while it <b>is</b> not possible to put a value on one's own death, it is possible to put a value on changes in the probability of one's own death. I think that this distinction does not solve the problem. If it is impossible to have preferences for consequences {{that would have to be}} experienced posthumously, it cannot help to make the event of death still more remote by a dimly perceived probability. People may be willing to express preferences and econometricians may be eager to interpret them. But, inasmuch as these preference are vacuous, they have no interpretation and attempts to do so may lead to the noted inconsistency. Consistent use of a wildly incorrect value of life in cost-benefit analyses involving risk leads to consistently incorrect conclusions. Instead of using a questionable value of life in dispassionate-looking computations, it may be better to give legitimacy to public decisions more directly by a mechanism akin to a ballot or a jury. ...|$|R

Scholars who study learning in video games draw direct parallels to tabletop role-playing games (RPGs) like Dungeons & Dragons in terms of the underlying principles that enhance learning. In fact, tabletop RPGs have formed the statistical, and sometimes creative, basis for many of the most popular role-playing video games to date, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> it <b>that</b> tabletop RPGs have been largely neglected in favor of the video game variety? This study takes a close look at how one particular group of players of Dungeons & Dragons engages the game as both a game and as an act of narrative creation. Their interactions can reveal something about how storytelling has changed in response to changes in technology and how this contributes to learning within various domains. In conducting this study, the author observed the group play and also became a participant in the experience to better understand how this group functions. Observation and interaction with these players show that they create stories <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not confined by the traditional boundaries of narrative, such as having a beginning, middle, and end.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Individuals {{who had won}} {{the lottery}} responded to a survey {{concerning}} whether they had continued to work after winning. They {{were also asked to}} indicate how important work was in their life using items and scales commonly used to measure work centrality. The authors predicted that whether lottery winners would continue to work would be related to their level of work centrality {{as well as to the}} amount of their win-nings. Individuals who won large amounts in the lottery would be less likely to quit work if they had relatively greater degrees of work centrality. After controlling for a number of variables (i. e., age, gender, education, occupation, and job satisfaction), results indicated that work centrality and the amount won were significantly related to whether individuals continued to work and, as predicted, the interaction between the two was also significant-ly related to work continuance. Key words: importance of work, job satisfaction, lottery winners, work behavior, work centrality THE RECENT FRENZY IN THE LOTTERY in which the potential winnings exceeded $ 250 million (i. e., Powerball) perhaps induced many people to fanta-size about what they would do if they actually won.

40|$|There’s a {{widespread}} intuition {{that if the}} only way an innocent person can stop her villainous attacker from killing her is to kill him instead, then she is morally permitted to do <b>so.</b> But <b>why</b> <b>is</b> it <b>that</b> she <b>is</b> permitted to employ lethal force on an aggressor if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what is required to save her life? My primary goal in {{this paper is to}} defend David Rodin's fairly recent and under-recognized account of self-defense that answers this question. There are roughly two kinds of non-consequentialist accounts of self-defense:'forced-choice' accounts and 'rights-based' accounts. I first examine what I take to be the most plausible 'forced-choice' account of self-defense and I argue <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> unable to withstand two recent criticisms. I then proceed to adjudicate between two prominent 'rights-based' accounts of self-defense: call them the Thomson/Uniacke account and the Rodinian account. Any rights-based account of self-defense must explain how it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> X, who villainously tries to kill Y, forfeits his right to life. I argue both that Thomson/Uniacke's explanation cannot account for the clear permissibility of killing a certain kind of aggressor in self-defense, and that the attempts <b>that</b> could <b>be</b> made to account for this permissibility are either ad-hoc or permit the killing of persons <b>that</b> <b>are</b> morally on par with innocent bystanders. I point out how Thomson/Uniacke can evade the seeming difficulties that I raise by only permitting lethal defensive force against culpable aggressors. But allowing defensive force to be employed only on the culpable goes against one of their central tenets. I then discuss the Rodinian account, how it evades the criticisms I raise, as well as its other virtues. I conclude that while it has difficulties of its own, it is the more plausible one to adopt...|$|R
40|$|Report of a CELT {{project on}} {{supporting}} students through innovation and researchThe major {{role played by}} assessment and feedback in any programme cannot be underestimated. It is {{through the process of}} assessment design that course/module learning outcomes are met and as a consequence student learning may be measured. Alongside the importance of assessment runs the value and effectiveness of feedback. In this study feedback is defined as commentaries made in respect of written assignment work. Rowntree’s (1987) seminal text about assessment provides a dramatic, yet highly pertinent claim <b>that</b> feedback “ <b>is</b> the life blood of learning”. The importance of assessment and feedback as a research focus continues to dominate the thinking behind designing appropriate and effective solutions to measure and support learning (Higgins, 2001; Mutch, 2003; Black and Wiliam, 2003; Rust et al 2003). <b>So,</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> it <b>that</b> some students do not collect assignment work and therefore cannot benefit from this supposed ‘transfusion’ for learning? Anecdotal evidence from within the School of Education would suggest <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> a small, but persistent, percentage of uncollected assignment work every year. The authors believed that such stories and figures would probably be mirrored within the School of Education and would be echoed across the University. This potential problem prompted the study to find out the extent of the actual problem. The issue of uncollected work and feedback may have consequences for student learning because students are unable to capitalise on any feedback or commentary provided by the tutor. In addition, the issue has particular implications for tutorial time, in terms of time spent writing feedback. This can be frustrating for tutors, who may have taken {{a great deal of time}} and thought in providing feedback, which is likely to be tailored to the individual needs of that particular student. The literature discussed with the findings tends to focus on the somewhat narrower dimensions of assessment and feedback, circumventing the larger picture of assessment processes within the wider arena of Higher Education. The report accepts as a given that within the University of Wolverhampton the outcomes based curriculum model is the prevalent design approach, and that alternative curriculum models may be used in other H. E. Institutions. The authors <b>are</b> cognisant <b>that</b> the lack of discussion around the possible influences of current curriculum models influencing H. E. programmes and modules, and consequently their impact on and for assessment and feedback, may pose a significant deficit in the scope of the background reading and discussion. However, as with any curriculum model, the process stands or falls on all the component parts working in synchronisation. If students are not involved or engaged in curriculum design and operation, including assessment processes, a few may feel disenfranchised. This may be a key reason why students neglect to collect assignment work...|$|R
40|$|In early {{essays on}} Herman Melville’s Billy Budd, Sailor, Richard Weisberg startled the {{literary}} and legal academic {{world with a}} novel claim: Captain Vere, he argued, {{far from being a}} tragic hero resigned to the moral and legal necessity of an unpopular act, as he had been commonly understood, was a murderer. His summary execution of Billy Budd, Weisberg showed, was neither required, excused, nor justified by law. Rather, Vere engineered an unreviewable conviction and death sentence, contrary to both the letter and spirit of the governing positive law, for personal gain. But <b>why</b> <b>was</b> Weisberg’s claim <b>so</b> novel? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> it <b>that</b> for seven decades, well over half a century, Vere’s villainy was so obscure, even to so many legally sophisticated readers? In this article, I argue that the obscurity of Vere’s villainy resulted from the dominant legal theories developed over the past seven decades. This, in turn, explains the novelty of Weisberg’s understanding of Vere’s character: his understanding rests on a conception of law and legal meaning distinctively outside all our received jurisprudential traditions. And it suggests a much-needed corrective, not only of our understanding of Melville’s story, but also of our conventional and critical jurisprudence. It suggests the case, more specifically, for moving our conventional legal thinking away from its focus on the unjust law, and toward the duplicitous or unjust adjudicator, and for moving our critical sensibility away from its still-dominant commitments to indeterminacy, legal skepticism, and interpretive flexibility, and toward an appreciation of the virtues of legal intransigence. In {{the first part of this}} article, I put forward an account of <b>why</b> it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Richard Weisberg could see clearly what was beyond the reach to most of Billy Budd’s professional readers for the duration of the book’s life, both in law and in literature. In the second part, I turn to Weisberg’s recent defense of legal intransigence, suggesting some reasons we should attend more carefully to the case Weisberg has made for intransigence and against “flexibility” in law and jurisprudence. I then offer a couple criticisms along with a qualified endorsement of Weisberg’s brief for interpretive fidelity to positive law, informed by humane commitments to text, law, and moral rectitude...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, Germany faced some of the {{greatest}} levels of destruction of any country in Europe, leaving their historic cities and iconic architecture in ruin. Across the country, some monuments were restored with the upmost attention to detail, while others were maintained in a state of rubble for decades.

But the two new nations shared a centuries-long history, and, after rehabilitating basic infrastructure and housing, both were facing the questions of what they wanted their new cultural identity to be, and how existing buildings from a formerly united German architectural heritage fit into that vision. High esteem for the Gothic style should have been part of their shared artistic patrimony. By the end of the thirteenth century, when the Gothic had migrated from France, the style was ubiquitous throughout Germany, reaching from Lübeck in the north to Freiburg in the south, and Cologne in the west to Magdeburg in the east. But, churches, particularly those designed in the Gothic style, became a source of great debate among post-war preservation officials, as their religious symbolism was viewed differently {{on either side of the}} inner German border. After the formal separation of West and East Germany, attitudes towards Gothic cathedrals diverged even more dramatically to the point <b>that</b> some <b>were</b> abandoned as empty shells or even dynamited into near oblivion. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>was</b> it <b>that</b> some churches got repaired while others were left in ruin? Were they not, despite different theological foundations (i. e., Roman Catholic and Reformed churches), on the same level of cultural or at least spiritual significance as one another? This thesis explores the motivation behind the varying levels of restoration, or lack there of, of Gothic churches in the post-war Germanys. The study begins with a theoretical, historical and ethnographic analysis of the state of preservation theory and aesthetic attitudes toward the Gothic in both the pre-war united Germany and the post-war divided Germanys. While comprehensive analysis of all Gothic restorations in Germany is beyond the scope of this research, a close and careful analysis of a select group of churches can yield fruitful and even surprising insights. This essay places special emphasis on two great churches, one in West Germany and the other in East Germany, namely, Cologne Cathedral and the Dresden Sophienkirche, as representative of underlying German attitudes towards restoration practices as a whole. Because their respective post-war fates are so strikingly opposite – full restoration for the Cologne Cathedral (a typical outcome in West Germany) and complete demolition for the Sophienkirche (sadly, not uncommon in East Germany) – the two buildings serve as symbols of clear distinction between the two new political ideologies that emerged in the mid-twentieth century. By balancing the focus of this study between East and West Germany, governmental action—or the lack thereof—highlights the role of political difference in post-war restoration decisions, especially considering the two nations came from the same pre-war theoretical and architectural background...|$|R
6000|$|Caraccioli {{was well}} known to the British officers, and had been ever highly esteemed by all who knew him. Captain Hardy ordered him {{immediately}} to be unbound, and {{to be treated with}} all those attentions which he felt due to a man who, when last on board the FOUDROYANT, had been received as an admiral and a prince. Sir William and Lady Hamilton were in the ship; but Nelson, it is affirmed, saw no one except his own officers during the tragedy which ensued. His own determination was made; and he issued an order to the Neapolitan commodore, Count Thurn, to assemble a court-martial of Neapolitan officers, on board the British flag-ship, proceed immediately to try the prisoner, and report to him, if the charges were proved, what punishment he ought to suffer. These proceedings were as rapid as possible; Caraccioli was brought on board at nine in the forenoon, and the trial began at ten. It lasted two hours: he averred in his defence that he had acted under compulsion, having been compelled to serve as a common soldier, till he consented to take command of the fleet. This, the apologists of Lord Nelson say, he failed in proving. They forget that the possibility of proving it was not allowed him, for he was brought to trial within an hour after he was legally in arrest; and how, in <b>that</b> time, <b>was</b> he to collect his witnesses? He was found guilty, and sentenced to death; and Nelson gave orders that the sentence should be carried into effect that evening, at five o'clock, on board the Sicilian frigate, LA MINERVA, by hanging him at the fore-yard-arm till sunset; when the body was to be cut down and thrown into the sea. Caraccioli requested Lieut. Parkinson, under whose custody he was placed, to intercede with Lord Nelson for a second trial--for this, among other reasons, that Count Thurn, who presided at the court-martial, was notoriously his personal enemy. Nelson made answer, that the prisoner had been fairly tried by the officers of his own country, and he could not interfere; forgetting that, if he felt himself justified in ordering the trial and the execution, no human being could ever have questioned the propriety of his interfering on the side of mercy. Caraccioli then entreated <b>that</b> he might <b>be</b> shot. [...] "I am an old man, sir," [...] said he: [...] "I leave no family to lament me, and therefore cannot be supposed to be very anxious about prolonging my life; but the disgrace of being hanged is dreadful to me." [...] When this was repeated to Nelson, he only told the lieutenant, with much agitation, to go and attend his duty. As a last hope, Caraccioli asked the lieutenant if he thought an application to Lady Hamilton would be beneficial? Parkinson went to seek her; she was not to be seen on this occasion; but she was present at the execution. She had the most devoted attachment to the Neapolitan court; and the hatred which she felt against those whom she regarded as its enemies, made her at this time forget what was due to the character of her sex as well as of her country. Here, also, a faithful historian is called upon to pronounce a severe and unqualified condemnation of Nelson's conduct. Had he the authority of his Sicilian majesty for proceeding as he did? If <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>was</b> not <b>that</b> authority produced? If not, <b>why</b> <b>were</b> the proceedings hurried on without it? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> the trial precipitated, so <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> impossible for the prisoner, if he had been innocent, to provide the witnesses, who might have proved him <b>so?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> a second trial refused, when the known animosity {{of the president of the}} court against the prisoner <b>was</b> considered? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> the execution hastened, so as to preclude any appeal for mercy, and render the prerogative of mercy useless? Doubtless, the British Admiral seemed to himself to be acting under a rigid sense of justice; but to all other persons it <b>was</b> obvious <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> influenced by an infatuated attachment--a baneful passion, which destroyed his domestic happiness, and now, in a second instance, stained ineffaceably his public character.|$|R
40|$|The United States is {{a driving}} force {{of the global economy}} and a major {{innovator}} in the technology sector. For decades the world has looked to The United States as a leader of great technological advancements with the strong economy to allow investors a chance make these technologies a reality. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> it now <b>that</b> we lag behind other countries {{when it comes to making}} our technology energy efficient? Sure we’ve been steadily growing our production of renewable resources with wind and solar energy, bet we are still behind in the second largest source of pollution, transportation. According to the EPA, transportation accounts for 27 % of total U. S. greenhouse gas emissions, lead only by electricity production. Since 1975, following the Arab oil embargo, the U. S. government has regulated vehicles through Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. The purpose of these standards is to improve the average fuel economy of vehicles made in the U. S. From 1990 until 2010, the standard for passenger vehicles was 27. 5 miles per gallon. For 20 years our emissions requirements were stagnant. Meanwhile, in 2010 the European Union had requirements 41 mpg and Japan had requirements of 46 mpg. In addition, the United States also trailed behind China, Canada, and India in vehicle standards as of 2010. These CAFE standards aren’t just good for reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions. When vehicles require less gasoline, it reduces our overall consumption. This is great news for people who want to reduce the United States dependence on foreign oil, and was the main purpose behind the CAFE standards being introduced in the first place. Increasing vehicle efficiency will improve our nation’s energy security and save drivers money when filling up at the pump. It’s for these reasons that I believe the U. S. needs to continue increasing the efficiency of our vehicles. The U. S. has set the standard for 2016 at 37. 8 mpg, and proposed a 56. 2 mpg standard in 2025. While it is a step in the right direction, perhaps we need to be doing more if we want to be world leaders once again. We need to set an example to the world <b>that</b> efficient vehicles <b>are</b> not only economically feasible, but necessary to reduce energy consumption and pollution on a meaningful scale...|$|R
