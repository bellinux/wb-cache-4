40|$|Abstract. A {{benchtop}} scouring {{procedure was}} used to evaluate the ability of conventional detergent scouring systems to adequately clean fleece samples from a selection of Western Australian Merino wools. Sixteen fleeces were selected from the Western Australian Department of Agriculture resource flocks, covering a wide range in yield (49. 2 to 77. 5 %), wax (7. 3 to 26. 9 %), suint (4. 9 to 11. 6 %), and dust (1. 4 to 16. 3 %) contents. Using a simple detergent-based system, 50 % of the fleeces were classified as effectively scoured, based on residual wax content. When scouring liquor was not refreshed between subsamples drawn from the same fleece, wool wax, staple length and dust content in the greasy fleece accounted for 93 % of the variation in the rate of residual wax increase observed in sequential 10 g samples of wool. Residual ash content also increased but the greasy fleece parameters measured were not statistically significant predictors of residual ash changes. The rate of <b>scoured</b> <b>wool</b> colour change, when sequential samples of greasy wool from the same fleece were scoured without liquor change, could be predicted from greasy fleece yields. The scouring efficiency of the more difficult to scour wools was improved by the addition of sodium carbonate to the main scouring bowls...|$|E
40|$|The {{anaerobic}} degradability of <b>wool</b> <b>scouring</b> effluent {{was investigated}} in batch cultures. The results were compared to the degradation of cellulose and sterile activated sludge. <b>Wool</b> <b>scouring</b> effluent was clearly more difficult to degrade anaerobically than cellulose or the biomass of activated sludge. The maximum biogas production rate from <b>wool</b> <b>scouring</b> effluent was about 46 % and 31 % of the maximal rates obtained from activated sludge and cellulose powder, respectively. The slow conversion rate and also the low percentage of the organics degraded showed that <b>wool</b> <b>scouring</b> effluent is particularly difficult to degrade anaerobically. Our results suggest that very long residence times (> 30 days) are required to successfully convert most of the organics in <b>wool</b> <b>scouring</b> effluent into biogas. The large digester size required questions the economics of such a treatment. However, in contrast to waste streams containing communal wastes, biomass waste or carbohydrates, <b>wool</b> <b>scouring</b> effluent as feed material is unlikely to cause digester failure by acidification, which would make its anaerobic digestion more stable and more easily controlable...|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} tensile {{behaviour}} of non-uniform fibres and fibrous composites. Wool fibres {{are used as}} an example of non-uniform fibres because they 2 ̆ 7 re physical, morphological and geometrical properties vary greatly not only between fibres but also within a fibre. The focus of this work is on the effect of both between-fibre and within-fibre diameter variations on fibre tensile behaviour. In addition, fit to the Weibull distribution by the non-brittle and non-uniform visco-elastic wool fibres is examined, and the Weibull model is developed further for non-uniform fibres with diameter variation along the fibre length. A novel model fibre composite is introduced to facilitate the investigation into the tensile behaviour of fibre-reinforced composites. This work first confirms that for processed wool, its coefficient of variation in break force can be predicted from that of minimum fibre diameters, and the prediction is better for longer fibres. This implies that even for processed wool, fibre breakage is closely associated with the occurrence of thin sections along a fibre, and damage to fibres during processing is not the main cause of fibre breakage. The effect of along-fibre diameter variation on fibre tensile behaviour of <b>scoured</b> <b>wool</b> and mohair is examined next. Only wet wool samples were examined in the past.

40|$|Heritabilities and {{phenotypic}} {{and genetic}} correlations for fleece traits were estimated from a data set comprising 805 {{male and female}} progeny of 44 sires of the Collinsville family group. Characteristics {{included in the study}} were greasy and clean fleece weight, yield, mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of fibre diameter, resistance to compression, scoured and greasy wool colour (expressed as yellowness, lightness and yellowness index), wax content, suint content, and subjectively assessed scores for greasy colour, character, handle, quality number, condition, staple formation, tip formation and density. Heritabilities of greasy and clean fleece weight, yield, mean fibre diameter and subjectively assessed fleece scores were in broad agreement with estimates from other Merino strains, but the genetic correlations of mean fibre diameter and associated characters (handle, quality number) with clean fleece weight were lower than previous estimates. Heritabilities for scoured yellowness of wool, resistance to compression and coefficient of variation of fibre diameter, which are potential additional measurements for the specification of wool in sale lots, were 0. 42 (¦. 0. 14), 0. 57 (¦ 0. 15) and 0. 47 (¦ 0. 15) respectively.

40|$|Genetic {{correlations}} between 29 wool production and quality traits and 14 whole carcass measures and carcass component traits were estimated from the Information Nucleus of 8 flocks managed across {{a range of}} Australian sheep production environments and genetically linked. Wool data were from over 5, 000 Merino progeny born over 5 yr, whereas carcass data were from over 1, 200 wether progeny of over 176 sires, slaughtered at about 21 kg carcass weight, on average. Wool traits included yearling and adult records for wool weight, fiber diameter, fiber diameter variation, staple strength, scoured color, and visual scores for breech and body wrinkle. Whole carcass measures included HCW, dressing percentage (DP), and various measures of fat depth and eye muscle dimensions. Carcass components were obtained by dissection, and lean meat yield (LMY) was predicted. Heritability estimates for whole carcass measures ranged from 0. 12 ± 0. 08 to 0. 35 ± 0. 10 and ranged from 0. 17 ± 0. 10 to 0. 46 ± 0. 10 for carcass dissection traits, with no evidence of important genotype × environment interactions. Genetic correlations indicated that selection for increased clean wool weight will result in reduced carcass fat (− 0. 17 to − 0. 34) and DP (− 0. 48 ± 0. 15), with little effect on carcass muscle. Selection for lower fiber diameter will reduce HCW (− 0. 48 ± 0. 15) as well as carcass fat (0. 14 to 0. 27) and muscle (0. 21 to 0. 50). There were high genetic {{correlations between}} live animal measures of fat and muscle depth and the carcass traits (generally greater than 0. 5 in size). Selection to increase HCW (and DP) will result in sheep with fewer wrinkles on the body (− 0. 57 ± 0. 10) and barer breeches (− 0. 74 ± 0. 12, favorable), with minor deterioration in <b>scoured</b> <b>wool</b> color (reduced brightness and increased yellowness). Selection for reduced fat will also result in sheep with fewer body wrinkles (− 0. 42 to − 0. 79). Increasing LMY in Merinos through selection would result in a large reduction in carcass fat and DP (− 0. 66 to − 0. 84), with a smaller increase in carcass muscle and some increase in wool weight and wrinkles. Although no major antagonisms are apparent between the wool and carcass traits, developing selection indexes for dual-purpose wool and meat breeding objectives will require accurate estimates of genetic parameters to ensure that unfavorable relationships are suitably considered.

40|$|Genetic {{correlations}} between 29 wool production and quality traits and 25 meat quality and nutritional value traits were estimated for Merino sheep from an Information Nucleus (IN). Genetic correlations among the meat quality and nutritional value traits are also reported. The IN comprised 8 flocks linked genetically and managed across {{a range of}} sheep production environments in Australia. The wool traits included over 5, 000 yearling and 3, 700 adult records for fleece weight, fiber diameter, staple length, staple strength, fiber diameter variation, <b>scoured</b> <b>wool</b> color, and visual scores for breech and body wrinkle. The meat quality traits were measured on samples from the M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum and included over 1, 200 records from progeny of over 170 sires for intramuscular fat (IMF), shear force of meat aged for 5 d (SF 5), 24 h postmortem pH (pH 24 LL; also measured in the semitendinosus muscle, pH 24 ST), fresh and retail meat color and meat nutritional value traits such as iron and zinc levels, and long-chain omega- 3 and omega- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels. Estimated heritabilities for IMF, SF 5, pH 24 LL, pH 24 ST, retail meat color lightness (L*), myoglobin, iron, zinc and across the range of long-chain fatty acids were 0. 58 ± 0. 11, 0. 10 ± 0. 09, 0. 15 ± 0. 07, 0. 20 ± 0. 10, 0. 59 ± 0. 15, 0. 31 ± 0. 09, 0. 20 ± 0. 09, 0. 11 ± 0. 09, and range of 0. 00 (eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic, and arachidonic acids) to 0. 14 ± 0. 07 (linoleic acid), respectively. The genetic {{correlations between}} the wool production and meat quality traits were low to negligible and indicate that wool breeding programs will have little or no effect on meat quality. There were moderately favorable genetic correlations between important yearling wool production traits and the omega- 3 fatty acids that were reduced for corresponding adult wool production traits, but these correlations are unlikely to be important in wool/meat breeding programs because they have high SE, and the omega- 3 traits have little or no genetic variance. Significant genetic correlations among the meat quality traits included IMF with SF 5 (- 0. 76 ± 0. 24), fresh meat color L* (0. 50 ± 0. 18), and zinc (0. 41 ± 0. 19). Selection to increase IMF will improve meat tenderness and color which may address some of the issues with Merino meat quality.

40|$|The wool {{production}} and fleece analysis of 50 extremely plainbodied stud ewes are given. The ewes were {{typical of the}} sheep of the stud (including the stud rams) and were obtained from a breeder who had consistently bred for extreme plainness, so that this characteristic is successfully being transmitted to the progeny. Thirty-five four-toothed stud ewes, recorded in 1940, gave an average greasy fleece of 13 • 28 lb.; a clean scoured fleece of 7 • 47 lb. as bone dry, or 8 • 7 lb. at 16 per cent. Regain; a yield of 58 • 4 per cent as dry or 67 • 7 per cent. on the the Bradford system; an average staple length of 4 • 0 inches and a 60 's quality number with a coefficient of variability of 4 • 5 per cent., indicating a uniform group. The number of fibres per square inch of skin ranged from 31, 700 to 45, 000, {{with an average of}} 41, 600. The average fleece density was 2 • 51 per cent. Fifteen four-toothed stud ewes, recorded in 1941, gave an average greasy fleece weight of 12 • 17 lb. with 6 • 99 lb. of clean <b>scoured</b> <b>wool</b> as bone dry, or 8 • 1 lb. of clean wool at 16 per cent. Regain. The yield was 58 • 1 per cent. as dry or 67 • 3 per cent. on the Bradford system. The average staple length was 3 • 8 inches and the quality number a 60 's with a coefficient of variability of 4 • 3 per cent. showing a uniform group. The number of fibres growing per square inch of skin ranged from 30, 200 to 71, 600 with an average of 46, 700. The average fleece density was 2 • 54 per cent. It is concluded that the extremely plainbodied stud here described possesses a good stud standard of production in regard to the total wool, the length, and the fleece density. The view held by many sheepmen that extremely plainbodied sheep must necessarily have inferior fleeces, cannot be substantiated. Not only do these sheep produce profitable fleeces, but by virtue of their smooth skins and strong constitutions, they possess the practical advantages of the plain bodied type. The reliability of judging merino {{wool production}} in practice is discussed. It is contended that the judgment of fleece density and quantity of wool is difficult because of the grease factor and an increased need for fleece testing has been experienced. In the stud analysed there is a highly significant correlation between greasy fleece weights and scoured fleece weights and an insignificant correlation between greasy fleece weights and yield. In consequence, the breeder can, by selecting the highest greasy fleece weights, automatically improve upon the clean wool production. This recommendation does not hold where there is a definite relationship between greasy fleece weights and yields. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

40|$|A {{number of}} ectoparasiticides are used on sheep {{to protect the}} animals from ill health {{associated}} with infestations of lice {{and the effects of}} fly-strike. Most of the compounds currently in use are organophosphate or pyrethroid-based and have been used for 15 - 20 years, or more. In more recent times, as with other pest control strategies, there has been a tendency to introduce 'newer' pesticides, principally in the form of insect growth regulators (IGRs). Vetrazin® was the first IGR-based compound to be registered for use as an ectoparasiticide in Australia and New Zealand. The active ingredient of Vetrazin® is cyromazine, a triazine-based compound. Prior to the introduction of Vetrazin®, and indeed more recently with other 'new' pesticides, little was, or is known regarding the fate of these compounds during woolscouring. Additionally, given the present practice for woolscours to discharge their aqueous effluents to the aquatic environment, little was, or is known regarding their effects on these receiving waters. In addition, cyromazine is a chemically 'unique' compound, apparently possessing chemical and environmental stability, as well as being highly polar. This uniqueness required the development of specialised techniques for its analysis. Its environmental stability and polarity also suggested that it could become a significant aquatic contaminant, certainly in localised situations. This thesis outlines the development of a clean-up method for the analysis of cyromazine residues in woolscouring waste waters and on greasy (shorn) and <b>scoured</b> <b>wool.</b> A clean-up method using Extract-Clean™ ion-exchange cartridges and analysis by both gas chromatography with nitorgenphosphorus detector (GC/NPD) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is described. The fate of cyromazine residues during the scouring of greasy wool was investigated by both laboratory and industrial pilot plant trials. Cyromazine was shown to be readily removed in the first three scouring bowls of a woolscour. A simple model is described {{that can be used to}} predict cyromazine effluent concentrations based on a known content for greasy wool. These effluent concentrations can then be used to assess compliance with a proposed environmental quality standard (EQS) established for cyromazine, based on aquatic bioassays. Aquatic bioassays were conducted with both Chironomus zealandicus (Diptera: Chironomidae) larvae and eggs and Deleatidium sp. (Ephemeroptera: Leptophlebiidae) nymphs. Cyromazine possessed negligible acute toxicity to both organisms, with the concentration required for 50 % mortality (LC 50) being greater than 100 mg/l. However, significant chronic toxicity to C. zealandicus was observed, with a lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC) of 25 µg/l being recorded. A proposed environmental quality standard (EQS) value of 1. 0 µg/l has been suggested, a figure supported by limited aquatic toxicity studies performed elsewhere. Cyromazine was shown to dominate approximately 30 % of the fly-strike control market in New Zealand. This high usage, plus a moderate EQS value, suggests that a minimum seven week withholding period be instigated between dipping for fly-strike control and shearing of treated sheep. Limited toxicity testing was carried out on another IGR-based ectoparasiticide, Zenith®, containing diflubenzuron. This testing, combined with published aquatic toxicity data, suggests than an EQS value for this compound be set at 0. 01 µg/l and a withholding period for dipped sheep be set at 18 weeks. Such a long withholding period is unlikely to be attainable in practice such that, if highly aquatically toxic compounds are going to be used as ectoparasiticides on sheep, then woolscours are going to have to invest in technology to remove pesticides from their effluents...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the final {{products from the}} current effluent treatment system for woolscouring (wool washing) plants, namely, (i) sludge produced from the chemical flocculation of solids in the wastewater from the wash bowls, and (ii) concentrated suint (sheep sweat) produced from evaporation of the liquid phase separated from the sludge. In addition, fibrous wastes from the woolscouring process were studied. The aims {{of the study were}} to (i) investigate whether suint could be applied in a sustainable way to arable land as a potassium fertiliser, and (ii) assess the conditions under which the sludge could be composted for use as a soil conditioner to return organic matter to soil. Experiments involving suint were performed at both laboratory and glasshouse scales, while experiments involving the solid woolscour wastes were based both in the laboratory and using a small-scale (4. 5 m 3 total capacity) in-vessel composting unit established at a New Zealand woolscour. Decomposition was measured using net-nitrogen mineralisation and weight loss methods. Suint, the water-soluble contaminants on the fleece, contained high levels of potassium (20 % on a dry weight basis) and also appreciable quantities of sulphur, sodium, and chlorine. Biological treatment before evaporation stabilised the resulting suint and improved the consistency of its composition. Suint did not affect the soil processes examined, in that it partly decomposed in soil, did not inhibit the turnover of model organic compounds, did not affect soil properties such as pH and electrical conductivity, and did not lead to increased leaching of mineral nitrogen. Suint was either neutral or positive towards plant performance when applied to soil at a rate of 100 kg potassium per hectare. Suint was therefore judged to be suitable for application to land and could be targeted to soils known to be deficient in potassium or to areas where crops with a high potassium demand are grown. Sludge, composed of dirt (soil particles, faecal matter, and skin and fibre debris) and wool grease, was highly variable in terms of its rate of decomposition, ranging from 0. 8 to 27. 8 % of the initial total nitrogen mineralised over 30 days at 37 ℃. Fibrous wastes, such as opener (fibre and contaminants removed from the wool by agitation prior to scouring) and <b>scoured</b> <b>wool</b> cleaner (wool fibre and dust removed from scoured and dried wool) wastes, also showed variability in decomposition rates. Sludge decomposition was improved by as much as threefold when co-incubated with fibrous wastes. Although it was shown that the polyacrylamide and pesticide content of sludge did not inhibit its decomposition, the effect of the grease content was not fully understood. Chemical properties of woolscour sludge, such as the carbon to nitrogen ratio, suggested that sludge was a substrate of good resource quality. From a biological perspective, however, the data suggested that woolscour sludge was limited in available nutrients; sludge nitrogen was derived principally from keratin, which decomposed at a low rate resulting in the slow release of mineral nitrogen and low levels of microbial activity. Thus, sludge appeared a poor substrate for composting. However, the results from composting trials indicated that the sludge could be successfully processed after blending with a bulking agent such as sawdust. The blended material showed a 90 % reduction in wool grease over 21 days of composting when the moisture content of the composting mass was kept optimal. Compost temperature exceeded 55 ℃ when wool fibre was added to the blend. Initial results from a case study involving the commercial composting of the entire sludge production (16 tonnes per day) from a New Zealand woolscour indicated that a saleable compost could be produced from a material that would otherwise go to landfill, and served to illustrate the commercial significance of these research results...|$|E
40|$|This {{evaluation}} and economic assessment is {{of a project}} funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) aimed at improving economic knowledge of the Chinese wool industry. The project was carried out jointly by Australian agricultural economists at the Universities of Queensland and Sydney and their Chinese colleagues attached to the Institute of Agricultural Economics within the Chinese Academy of the Agricultural Sciences and the Institute of Rural Development within the Chinese Academy of the Social Sciences. The research has concentrated on understanding the supply side of the Chinese wool industry and links between wool production and the marketing system within China. However, the research has consequences for Chinese and Australian understanding of the demand for local and imported wool within China and for Australian wool on the world market. The research also has implications for farm management within China and economic policy decisions within both countries. In particular, the research is relevant to the future course of the trade in raw wool and wool semi-manufactures between Australia and China. In some recent years, China {{has been the most}} important buyer of Australian wool. In broad terms, exports of greasy wool and semi-manufactures (<b>scoured</b> <b>wool</b> and wool tops) from Australia to China now account for around one-fifth of Australian production (detailed information on Australian wool exports and world production and trade in wool is presented in section F of the Australian Wool Compendium published by Wool International). Within China, the wool industry is specially important because of its economic and political significance to ethnic minorities living in the pastoral region. This region is vulnerable to overgrazing and land degradation. Wool is the major source of cash income in some districts. Sheepmeat {{is an important part of}} the food supply for ethnic minorities. The balance between wool and sheepmeat in the sheep industry affects the total quantity of wool produced and, even more so, the type of wool produced. The quality composition of the wool clip determines the types of products into which wool can be processed and thus the extent of competition between domestic wool and imported wool. Developments in Chinese wool production are important to Australia because China is both a major wool consumer and a processor of domestic and imported wool for the Chinese market and export. The clothing and textile industries are already an important component of the Chinese economy and significant in its overall development strategy. China is now the world’s largest exporter of clothing and second largest exporter of textiles, despite severe handicaps incurred from widespread restrictions on trade in clothing and textiles reflected in the Multi-fibre Arrangement that regulates world trade in clothing and textiles (Drysdale 1997). Zhong Chuanshi and Yang Yongsheng (1997) have recently reviewed economic issues surrounding Chinese exports of clothing and textiles. These products have been a driving force behind the surge in China’s exports that have accompanied the opening of the Chinese economy over the last two decades. From 1980 to 1994, textile and clothing exports rose from US$ 4. 4 billion to US$ 35. 5 billion, an increase more than eight-fold (Zhong and Yang 1997). Furthermore, these industries have created the basis upon which imports of technology, machinery and equipment essential for the development of other sectors of the economy can be financed. While it is obvious that wool in aggregate competes with synthetic fibres, artificial fibres and cotton in markets for clothing and textiles, it is less clear how wool of different origins competes in determining the shares of Australian wool and other wool in Chinese output of clothing and textiles. This is because wool processing uses specialised assets. Firms in the wool processing business in China and elsewhere are interested in maintaining the throughput of their operations. Blending wool from different countries may also have positive effects on processing performance. In economic terms, the issue is whether Chinese wool and imported wool are substitutes or complements. Formulation of other Australian policies for the wool industry depends upon knowledge of the economic interaction of domestic Chinese wool production and wool imported from other countries, principally Australia. Australia has an ongoing interest in maintaining access to the Chinese market, the emerging role of China in the world textile industry, and Chinese participation in world trade generally. Chinese demand for Australian wool has been most unstable over recent years—both cause and effect of the profound difficulties for the Australian wool industry associated with the demise of the reserve price scheme and the protracted recovery following that Australian-induced debacle. Knowledge of the supply side of the Chinese wool industry is obviously critical to Australian understanding of the short-term and long-term outlook for wool upon which many private investments and government decisions are based. Moreover, understanding (if not resolution) of perennial Australian disputes in the wool industry concerning exports of Australian Merino sheep largely depends on economic information on wool supply in major wool producing countries. On closer inspection, the long-running conflict over the export of Merino sheep to China and elsewhere is a variant of a far wider debate concerning the effects on Australian farmers of assistance by Australia to agricultural development in Third World countries. In the case of wool, the argument hinges on the economics of wool supply versus sheepmeat in the wool industry in the Chinese pastoral region as well as the competitiveness (or complementary position) of Australian wool and Chinese wool in processing and final demand. Of far greater financial significance to Australian woolgrowers than the controversial controls over exports of Merino sheep is their compulsory participation in generic promotion of wool that does not (and could not) distinguish wool by country of origin. The component of domestic Chinese wool in Chinese exports of semi-processed wool and wool endproducts is one ingredient in the complex economics of wool promotion. The emerging Chinese wool processing industry is a major beneficiary of the current Australian approach to promotion because Chinese wool endproducts, whatever the origin of wool, attract Woolmark certification and promotion, increasing their competitiveness with wool end-products produced by established processing firms in other countries. Wool promotion is an important public policy and commercial issue for the Australian wool industry (Haszler 1997). Over 1995 – 96 and 1996 – 97 Australian woolgrowers contributed a total of over $ 230 m towards the world-wide promotion effort managed by the International Wool Secretariat, largely through their current 3. 5 per cent promotion tax. Arguably, the Woolmark ‘brand’ that is the basis of generic promotion of wool has substituted for firm-specific brands and made it easier for new firms and emerging countries in the wool trade such as China to become established in the markets of developed countries (Watson 1997). There are practical and theoretical differences between economic assessment of scientific versus economic research into agricultural production. Economic research is generally less costly than scientific research because it have expensive requirements such as capital equipment and land for research stations. Like other agricultural research, the adoption of economic analysis leading to improvements in farm management depends upon decisions by farmers. The benefits of research can then be observed directly in higher (net) farm incomes. The rate of adoption is an important determinant of the research profitability. According to the nature of the research, on-farm research may require capital investment by farmers. The connection between economic research and economic benefit is less where that research leads to decisions by Governments on agricultural policy. Often, policy decisions are re-inforced by economic research but also based on other evidence or a priori economic reasoning. Therefore, while changes in economic policy bring about a range of actions by economic agents, not all of the associated costs and benefits can be directly linked to the underlying research. Moreover, adoption of policies by Government is generally discrete rather than continuous. Judging the specific contribution of this project to the changes in economic policy that have taken place in the Chinese wool industry is perhaps the most difficult and problematic component of this assessment. In the present case, the gains from research on Chinese wool production mainly relate to increased gains from trade that are occurring because the research has reduced impediments to the import of Australian wool. In addition, liberalisation of the wool trade is part of the process by which Chinese aspirations to join the World Trade Organisation are responded to by Australia. wool, china, production, trade, Australia, industry, Agricultural and Food Policy, Farm Management, International Development, Livestock Production/Industries, Production Economics,...|$|E

Willow, as a short forest rotation, represents a significant land use that could produce a high dry matter and benefit from the application of effluent irrigation. However, {{there has been little}} information on the effect of effluent irrigation on the growth of willow and the removal of nutrients. In order to assess the effects of dairy, piggery and <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluents on willow growth, a greenhouse experiment was established using the Manawatu sandy fine loam soil. A complete nutrient solution and nutrient - free tap water treatments were also included in addition to the effluent treatments. The design of the experiment was a 5 x 2 factorial combination of treatments with four replications in randomized blocks. Two factors (effluents and irrigation rates) each with 5 levels were examined, the levels of irrigation were 12. 5 mm, 25 mm, 37. 5 mm, 50 mm and 62. 5 mm per fortnight. The plant growth, production and macro-nutrients accumulation, and the soil pH, electrical conductivity, and total N, P and cations were monitored Irrigation with effluents affected the growth of willow cutting. The piggery and dairy effluent irrigation increased the willow growth and nutrient accumulation followed the increase in DM yield. The piggery and dairy irrigation accounted for 32 % and 18 % increase in total DM yield over tap water; while the <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluent resulted in 17 % decrease in comparison with tap water. Irrigation with dairy, piggery and <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluents onto the Manawatu fine sandy loam soil, caused a significant increase in pH and EC. The significant change in pH and EC was attributed to the soluble salts in these effluents, especially K in the <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluent. The recovery of N from these effluents was very small and was less than that of P and K in soil. Chemical analysis of willow, treated with dairy, piggery and <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluents up to 8 weeks, showed a relatively high concentration of N, P and K in leaf, and had a very high K and a very low Mg concentration in leaf with <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluent irrigation. However, the efficiency of the N, P and K nutrient accumulated by willow was inversely related to the concentration of these effluents and the DM yield of willow cutting was positively related to the irrigation rates. It was evident that willow cutting was too young to require a large quantity of nutrients at the early growth stage and there was a risk of nutrient loss with increasing irrigation rate. The application of <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluent caused a very high pH and EC, and the willow cutting growth decreased at > 37. 5 mm/fortnight irrigation rates. The reasons for the detrimental effects of <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluent on soil properties and willow growth need to be investigated further. The results suggested {{that it is possible to}} enhance the willow growth and adjust the soil fertility by application of dairy and piggery effluents irrigation...|$|R

Fiber samples after scouring were measured for color index, residual grease content, and residual ash content. Ultrasonic scouring was found to improve removal of grease and ash from the wool fiber. Modifications were proposed for the design of an industrial scouring line including the addition of fiber transport and dunking rollers and number of baths for the installation. © The Author(s) 2014...|$|R
