500|$|During two outings in late 1979 {{and early}} 1980 several {{researchers}} (including Thomas H. Heaton and John G. Anderson) examined the region near the New River and discovered ground disturbances that {{were related to}} the Brawley aftershock. Along the banks of the river the seismologists discovered <b>sand</b> <b>boils,</b> a newly formed pond, and an extension crack that was found to run [...] near the south bank in an irregular and disconnected fashion from Brawley to Wiest lake. It was later discovered that the Brawley earthquake had an aftershock zone that matched the area of the disturbances. Accelerograms recorded from the nearby Del Rio Country Club also showed [...] "clear and impressive evidence" [...] of near field ground motions, which may have indicated nearby primary faulting.|$|E
500|$|Three {{locations}} between Spitak and Nalband (to the west) {{that were}} within several kilometers of the fault were examined for ground disturbances and each site was scrutinized {{for the effects}} of liquefaction. The first site was on the highway that linked the three most damaged cities and was adjacent to a tributary of the Pambak river where the water table was close to the surface. The highway's embankment failed, and though the site was repaired immediately, the resulting damage to the highway caused considerable delay in getting people and supplies {{into and out of the}} area following the disaster. Numerous <b>sand</b> <b>boils</b> were seen in the region northwest of Spitak including within [...] of the failed embankment. A second site that was close to the fault, also near the Pambak river and with similar soil deposits, did not experience liquefaction, though it would have experienced the same high peak ground accelerations as the failed highway embankment.|$|E

This <b>sand</b> <b>boiling</b> took place because the ground at this area is mostly composed of the sand, and from the ground surface to a depth of 12  m was categorized as potentially liquefiable. Furthermore, liquefaction was also affected by the former river on the north–south side of this area. This potentially liquefiable sand on the ground surface may lead to structural damage related to structure tilting due to <b>sand</b> <b>boiling.</b>|$|R

500|$|Numerous sites {{running along}} the New River were {{examined}} including the twin reinforced concrete bridges in Brawley. Slumping of the foundations there resulted in severe damage, and occurred {{as a result of}} the October 15 main shock, though the Brawley earthquake's epicenter was nearby. At the Imperial County Dump, several instances of ground failure were observed in sedimentary deposits near the top of and parallel to the river bank, and other cracks were found in that area that were determined to be the result of differential settling. Farther north at the entrance to the Del Rio Country Club, [...] scarplets were located west of Route 111, but undisturbed Pleistocene sedimentary layers likely indicated that the scarps were the result of local slumping in the roadcut and not the result of surface faulting.

50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>boils</b> {{occur when}} a dike {{completely}} penetrates the non-liquefied layer above it and reaches the ground surface.

50|$|An {{example of}} this is during the 1989 {{earthquake}} in San Francisco, when <b>sand</b> <b>boils</b> brought up debris from the 1906 earthquake. This process is a result of liquefaction. By mapping the location of <b>sand</b> <b>boils</b> that erupted in the Marina District during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, scientists discovered the site of a lagoon that existed in 1906.

50|$|Soil piping is a {{particular}} form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation.

50|$|A breach can be {{a sudden}} or gradual failure that is caused either by surface erosion or by a {{subsurface}} failure of the levee. Levee breaches are often accompanied by levee boils, or <b>sand</b> <b>boils.</b> The underseepage resurfaces on the landside, {{in the form of}} a volcano-like cone of <b>sand.</b> <b>Boils</b> signal a condition of incipient instability which may lead to erosion of the levee toe or foundation or result in sinking of the levee into the liquefied foundation below. Some engineers think that boils lead to a form of internal erosion called piping which undermines the levee, but others consider them a symptom of generalized instability of the foundation.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{mechanisms}} of failure of levees is a phenomenon called ??piping,?? which generally begins {{with the formation of}} a <b>sand</b> <b>boil</b> at the leeward side of the levee, and has been frequently observed to proceed upstream along the base of the levee through a slit formation. The issue of most important concern is to estimate the critical head that could promote the occurrence of piping. Considering the flow through porous media and coupling it with Bernoulli?s equation and a critical tractive stress condition, a model is developed for the critical head. Using appropriate transformations, the proposed model takes on a form which supports Bligh?s empirical findings. Another model based on critical velocity is also developed to estimate the critical head. The functional form of these two models is evaluated using the critical head versus porosity data from a number of laboratory studies conducted in the Netherlands. These models were found to perform better than did Terzaghi?s model...|$|R

Their stability is crucial for the local communities, being the Po River plain densely populated.

This paper describes the reactivation of a <b>sand</b> <b>boil</b> in a river embankment section in the Province of Ferrara, during the 2014 major high-water event. Detailed stratigraphic soil profiling as well as careful geotechnical characterization of the embankment and of the subsoil have been carried out on the basis of in-situ tests.

40|$|AbstractThe 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake {{caused the}} severe {{liquefaction}} of reclaimed {{lands in the}} Tokyo Bay area, from Shinkiba in Tokyo through Urayasu, Ichikawa and Narashino Cities to Chiba City. However, the reclaimed lands that had been improved by the sand compaction pile method, the gravel drain method or other methods did not liquefy. The reclaimed lands that did liquefy had been constructed after around 1966 with soil dredged {{from the bottom of}} the bay. The dredged and filled soils were estimated to have been liquefied by the earthquake. Seismic intensities in the liquefied zones were not high, although the liquefied grounds were covered with <b>boiled</b> <b>sand.</b> Most likely it was the very long duration of the main shock, along with the large aftershock that hit 29 min later, which induced the severe liquefaction. Sidewalks and alleys buckled at several sites, probably due to a kind of sloshing around of the liquefied ground. Moreover, much <b>sand</b> <b>boiled</b> from the ground and the ground subsided significantly because the liquefied soil was very fine. Many houses settled notably and tilted. In Urayasu City, 3680 houses were more than partially destroyed. Sewage pipes meandered or were broken, their joints were extruded from the ground, and many manholes were horizontally sheared. This remarkable damage may also have occurred due to the sloshing around of the liquefied ground...|$|R
50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>boils</b> {{can be a}} {{mechanism}} contributing to liquefaction and levee failure during floods. This effect {{is caused by a}} difference in pressure on two sides of a levee or dike, most likely during a flood. This process can result in internal erosion, whereby the removal of soil particles results in a pipe through the embankment. The creation of the pipe will quickly pick up pace and will eventually result in failure of the embankment.|$|E

The purpose {{of this research is}} to determine the depth and thickness of liquefiable soil layers using the flat blade dilatometer test (DMT) method. The horizontal stress index values (KD) obtained from the DMT were used to calculate the cyclic resistance ratio (CRR), while the PGA (peak ground acceleration) calculated by the software EZ-FRISK 7. 52 were employed to determine the cyclic stress ratio (CSR). The DMT-based liquefaction potential analysis shows that the thickness of liquefiable soil layers ranges from 1. 8 to 4. 0 m. These results show a good agreement with the previous analysis based on CPT (cone penetration test) data.

40|$|Internal erosion often {{occurs when}} seepage flow is {{concentrated}} into a small, unprotected opening. One such example is where sandy soil is eroded through a defect in an overlying clay layer, {{resulting in a}} <b>sand</b> <b>boil</b> in the process. The erosion initiates through the heave and backward piping mechanisms and continues beneath the clay layer through the piping process, forming a pipe that progresses toward {{the source of the}} seepage. The initiation of erosion at the seepage flow concentration is a complex mechanism involving a number of hydraulic and soil mechanics principles, including: flow concentration, soil arching, heave, detachment of soil grains, and transportation of soil grains. A laboratory testing program is being performed to investigate the mechanisms of erosion into a concentrated, unprotected exit. The study builds upon previous research on the mechanisms of piping initiation performed at Utah State University and uses a similar apparatus. A number of different soils representing a range of grain size, grain shape, and gradations are being forced to erode into a range of constricted seepage exits. The exit is fixed with a riser pipe to model the upward transport of eroding soils. The results are compared with axisymmetric finite element analyses in order to develop {{a better understanding of the}} initiation process for backward erosion piping...|$|R
