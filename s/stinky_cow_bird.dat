None of the fish isolates produced acid from lactose (Lac-), however Lac-/lacG- isolates were observed in pigs, <b>cows,</b> <b>birds</b> and humans. Most of the dairy isolates (77. 8 %) were Lac+/lacG+, but some dairy isolates did not produce acid from this sugar. Data in the present study show that the ability to metabolize lactose and the presence of the lacG gene are heterogeneously scattered among L. garvieae isolates of different sources. Therefore, the use of these criteria as markers to differentiate between L. garvieae isolates of dairy and fish origin should be considered with caution...|$|R

50|$|The Middle Ages made pâté a masterpiece: {{that which}} is, in the 21st century, merely spiced minced meat (or fish), baked in a terrine and eaten cold, {{was at that}} time {{composed}} of a dough envelope stuffed with varied meats and superbly decorated for ceremonial feasts. The first French recipe, written in verse by Gace de La Bigne, mentions in the same pâté three great partridges, six fat quail, and a dozen larks. Le Ménagier de Paris mentions pâtés of fish, game, young rabbit, fresh venison, beef, pigeons, mutton, veal, and pork, and even pâtés of lark, turtledove, <b>cow,</b> baby <b>bird,</b> goose, and hen. Bartolomeo Sacchi, called Platine, prefect of the Vatican Library, gives the recipe for a pâté of wild beasts: the flesh, after being boiled with salt and vinegar, was larded and placed inside an envelope of spiced fat, with a mélange of pepper, cinnamon and pounded lard; one studded the fat with cloves until it was entirely covered, then placed it inside a pâte.|$|R

Some people say that boys cannot help it; that it is nature, and only a proof that we are all originally descended from beasts of prey. But whether it is nature or not, little boys can help it, and must help it. For if they have naughty, low, mischievous tricks in their nature, as monkeys have, that is no reason why they should give way to those tricks like monkeys, who know no better. And therefore they must not torment dumb creatures; for if they do, a certain old lady who is coming will surely give them exactly what they deserve.|$|R

From each composite sample, 28 colonies of each bacterial species were typed before and after storage and the strains were assigned to different biochemical phenotypes (BPTs). A significant {{reduction in the number}} of E. coli was observed in all samples stored at - 20 °C, and three of the seven animal samples stored at - 80 °C.
