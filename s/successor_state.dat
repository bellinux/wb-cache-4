Commissioned into the French fleet as Thionville, the ship served from 1920 to 1932 as a training ship, and from 1932 to 1941 as a barracks ship in Toulon before being broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski's Promethean program, {{designed}} {{to weaken the}} Russian Empire and its <b>successor</b> <b>state,</b> the Soviet Union, by supporting nationalist independence movements of major non-Russian peoples dwelling in Russia and the Soviet Union, was coordinated from 1927 to the 1939 outbreak of World War II in Europe by the military intelligence officer, Edmund Charaszkiewicz. In the Interbellum, the Prometheist movement yielded few tangible results.|$|E

5|$|The {{territory}} of present-day Cameroon was first settled during the Neolithic Era. The longest continuous inhabitants are {{groups such as}} the Baka (Pygmies). From here, Bantu migrations into eastern, southern, and central Africa are believed to have originated about 2,000 years ago. The Sao culture arose around Lake Chad c. AD 500 and gave way to the Kanem and its <b>successor</b> <b>state,</b> the Bornu Empire. Kingdoms, fondoms, and chiefdoms arose in the west.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May 1850, Joaquim Inácio was {{appointed}} inspector {{of the naval}} shipyard at Rio de Janeiro. He played {{no role in the}} Platine War that pitted the Empire against the Argentine Confederation (the <b>successor</b> <b>state</b> of the United Provinces of the River Plate), which lasted from late 1851 until early 1852. He spent that period in the capital overseeing the construction and repair of several sailing vessels and steamships for the Brazilian armada. He was promoted to chief of division (modern-day rear admiral) on 3 March 1852.|$|E
5|$|The Empire of Trebizond, {{which had}} split {{away from the}} Byzantine Empire just weeks before Constantinople {{was taken by the}} Crusaders in 1204, became the last remnant and last de facto <b>successor</b> <b>state</b> to the Byzantine Empire. Efforts by the Emperor David to recruit European powers for an anti-Ottoman crusade {{provoked}} war between the Ottomans and Trebizond in the summer of 1461. After a month-long siege, David surrendered the city of Trebizond on 14 August 1461. The Empire of Trebizond's Crimean principality, the Principality of Theodoro (part of the Perateia), lasted another 14 years, falling to the Ottomans in December 1475.|$|E

5|$|During {{the breakup}} of Yugoslavia, the United States engaged in both combative and {{economic}} conflict, particularly with Serbia, known {{at the time as}} the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (one of socialist Yugoslavia's successor states). The United States imposed sanctions and spearheaded a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999. During this period, another wave of Serbian emigration ensued, and many Serbian refugees moved to the United States. In the 2000s, diplomatic relations between the United States and Yugoslavia were restored, but were changed when Montenegro seceded in 2006, after which Serbia was the <b>successor</b> <b>state</b> to continue relations previously held by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in February 2008, a move which the US recognized.|$|E
5|$|The united Germany is {{considered}} to be the enlarged continuation of the Federal Republic of Germany and not a <b>successor</b> <b>state.</b> As such, it retained all of West Germany's memberships in international organisations. Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act, adopted in 1994, Berlin once again became the capital of the reunified Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries. The relocation of the government was completed in 1999. Following the 1998 elections, SPD politician Gerhard Schröder became the first Chancellor of a red–green coalition with the Alliance '90/The Greens party. Among the major projects of the two Schröder legislatures was the Agenda 2010 to reform the labour market to become more flexible and reduce unemployment.|$|E
5|$|Most {{parts of}} the {{fortress}} were finished during the First World War, and many minor works were started and completed {{during the course of}} the war. Even though Sweden remained neutral during the First and Second World War, the start and outcome of both had large impact on the fortress. Finland's independence during the First World War created a buffer state between Sweden and Imperial Russia's <b>successor</b> <b>state,</b> the Soviet Union, which radically changed the strategic value of northern Sweden, put the usefulness of Boden Fortress into question. Only the most basic needs were satisfied during the interwar period; even apparent needsbased on the experiences from the warsuch as better air defence and fortifications to halt or temporarily impede attacks by armoured forces were neglected. Thanks to local commanders, construction of new fortifications and improvements to already existing ones were done with the help of garrisoned troops. Engineer companies built new shelters and trenches as training, and the telephone network was improved and completed by the garrisoned telegraph company. This cut the cost drastically as the only expenditure was the needed material.|$|E

5|$|The average {{ordinary}} {{revenue of}} the republic at this time amounted to between 28 and 35 million guilders. However, since {{the outbreak of the}} war in 1793 the expenditure had been running at between 40 and 55 millions. For the year 1800 the republic had to find 78 million guilders for its expenditures. In other words, the new Agent of Finance, Gogel, was faced with a financial emergency. He needed to generate about 50 million guilders annually in ordinary revenue on a permanent basis urgently. Besides, as the Dutch tax system was heavily skewed toward highly regressive indirect taxes, which inordinately burdened the impoverished population, he wanted to change this to a system that depended more on direct (income and wealth) taxes. Finally, he wanted {{to do away with the}} provincial differentiation in the taxation, and construct a nationally standardized system. When he put these reform proposals to the Representative Assembly on 30 September 1799, they met with massive resistance. This led to so much delay in its acceptance that by the time it was to be implemented (in 1801) the re-federalisation of the state by the new Staatsbewind regime was already underway. Eventually, Gogel's reforms were only implemented under the <b>successor</b> <b>state</b> of the Kingdom of Holland.|$|E
25|$|If it {{is desired}} to save memory, the storage {{can be reduced}} to one array plus 3 line buffers. One line buffer is used to {{calculate}} the <b>successor</b> <b>state</b> for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the <b>successor</b> <b>state</b> for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the <b>successor</b> <b>state</b> for the third line. If a toroidal array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.|$|E

Balhae was a state that existed in the area during the Tang Dynasty in China and the Unified Silla Period in Korea.
