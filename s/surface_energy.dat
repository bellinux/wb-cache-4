5|$|Surface tension has the {{dimension}} of force per unit length, or of energy per unit area. The two are equivalent, but when referring to energy per unit of area, {{it is common to}} use the term <b>surface</b> <b>energy,</b> which is a more general term {{in the sense that it}} applies also to solids.|$|E

5|$|The {{observed}} helium to hydrogen {{ratio in}} Vega is 0.030±0.005, {{which is about}} 40% lower than the Sun. This {{may be caused by}} the disappearance of a helium convection zone near the <b>surface.</b> <b>Energy</b> transfer is instead performed by the radiative process, which may be causing an abundance anomaly through diffusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{penetration}} front propagates {{to minimize}} the <b>surface</b> <b>energy</b> until it reaches {{the edges of the}} drop, thus arriving at the Wenzel state. Since the solid can be considered an absorptive material due to its surface roughness, this phenomenon of spreading and imbibition is called hemiwicking. The contact angles at which spreading/imbibition occurs are between 0 and π/2.|$|E
5|$|Liquids can {{interact}} with two main types of solid surfaces. Traditionally, solid surfaces have been divided into high-energy solids and low-energy types. The relative {{energy of a}} solid {{has to do with}} the bulk nature of the solid itself. Solids such as metals, glasses, and ceramics are known as 'hard solids' because the chemical bonds that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively large amount of energy is required to cut the bulk and make two separate surfaces so high <b>surface</b> <b>energy),</b> so they are termed “high energy”. Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high-energy surfaces.|$|E

According to the {{conditions}} of preparation of mullite composites by open-system hydrothermal crystallization method, <b>surface</b> <b>energies</b> of mullite crystal were calculated by the first principle plane pseudo-potential.

5|$|Because {{these three}} <b>surface</b> <b>energies</b> form {{the sides of}} a triangle, they are {{constrained}} by the triangle inequalities, γij < γjk + γik meaning that no one of the surface tensions can exceed {{the sum of the}} other two. If three fluids with <b>surface</b> <b>energies</b> that do not follow these inequalities are brought into contact, no equilibrium configuration consistent with Figure 3 will exist.|$|R

At fcc and bcc metal surfaces we obtain damped oscillatory multilayer relaxations. Furthermore, we present {{results for the}} reconstruction at clean (110) and (100) surfaces of Ir, Pt and Au. CO-suppressed and H-induced reconstruction observed at some transition metal surfaces is quantitatively explained by coverage-dependent correction terms to <b>surface</b> <b>energies.</b> 1...|$|R
25|$|UV {{radiation}} {{is useful in}} preparing low-surface-energy polymers for adhesives. Polymers exposed to UV will oxidize, thus raising the <b>surface</b> <b>energy</b> of the polymer. Once the <b>surface</b> <b>energy</b> of the polymer has been raised, the bond between the adhesive and the polymer is stronger.|$|E
25|$|Fluorocarbons and {{especially}} perfluorocarbons are excellent substrate {{materials for the}} creation of superhydropbobic surfaces due to their extremely low <b>surface</b> <b>energy.</b> These types of materials are synthesized via the replacement of hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms of a hydrocarbon.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} kinetic {{friction}} at nanoscale {{can be explained}} by thermodynamics. Upon sliding, new surface forms at the back of a sliding true contact, and existing surface disappears at the front of it. Since all surfaces involve the thermodynamic <b>surface</b> <b>energy,</b> work must be spent in creating the new surface, and energy is released as heat in removing the surface. Thus, a force is required to move the back of the contact, and frictional heat is released at the front.|$|E
30|$|The <b>surface</b> free <b>energy</b> {{of a solid}} {{also affects}} its wettability. A solid with high <b>surface</b> free <b>energy</b> is more easily wetted than one with low <b>surface</b> free <b>energy</b> [16]. The <b>surface</b> free <b>energy</b> of wood, specifically, is often {{correlated}} with the biological interactions between the wood surface and other materials [17]. To some extent, the greater the <b>surface</b> free <b>energy,</b> the better the spreadability of a liquid on the wood surface [18]. It also has an important influence on the bonding strength of wood composites [19]. The <b>surface</b> free <b>energy</b> of wood can, similar to its wettability, be determined according to the contact angle of reference liquids on the wood surface.|$|R
30|$|Although YSZ is the {{material}} under investigation in this work, for {{the calculation of}} the low-index <b>surface</b> <b>energies,</b> we only considered the cubic undoped crystal, since {{it has been shown}} that the trend of the low-index surface relative stability for c-ZrO 2 and YSZ does not change [21]. Therefore, the computed <b>surface</b> <b>energies</b> obtained considering undoped cubic zirconia are expected to bring, at least qualitatively, to the same conclusions.|$|R
40|$|We have {{computed}} the <b>surface</b> <b>energies,</b> work functions, and interlayer surface relaxations {{of clean}} (111), (110), and (100) surfaces of Al, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Pt, and Au. Many of these metallic surfaces have technological or catalytic applications. We compare experimental reference values {{to those of}} the local density approximation (LDA), the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA), the PBEsol (PBE for solids) GGA, the SCAN meta-GGA, and SCAN+rVV 10 (SCAN with a long-range van der Waals or vdW correction). The closest agreement with uncertain experimental values is achieved by the simplest density functional (LDA) and by the most sophisticated general-purpose one (SCAN+rVV 10). The long-range vdW interaction increases the <b>surface</b> <b>energies</b> by about 10 %, and the work functions by about 1 %. LDA works for metal surfaces through a stronger-than-usual error cancellation. PBE yields the most-underestimated and presumably least accurate <b>surface</b> <b>energies</b> and work functions. <b>Surface</b> <b>energies</b> within the random phase approximation (RPA) are also reported. Interlayer relaxations from different functionals are in reasonable agreement with one another, and usually with experiment...|$|R
25|$|Adsorption can be broadly {{classified}} as {{being one of}} two types: physisorption or chemisorption. Physisorption is characterized by weak van der Waals interactions, and bond enthalpies typically less than 20kJ/mol. Chemisorption, alternatively, is defined by stronger covalent and ionic bonds, with bond enthalpies between 250 and 500kJ/mol. In both cases, the adsorbate atoms or molecules (i.e. the particles which adhere to the surface) are attracted to the adsorbent (solid) surface because of the <b>surface</b> <b>energy</b> that results from unoccupied bonding locations at the surface. The degree of orbital overlap then determines if the interactions will be physisorptive or chemisorptive.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to surface}} tension, {{adsorption}} {{is a consequence}} of <b>surface</b> <b>energy.</b> In a bulk material, all the bonding requirements (be they ionic, covalent or metallic) of the constituent atoms of the material are filled by other atoms in the material. However, atoms {{on the surface of the}} adsorbent are not wholly surrounded by other adsorbent atoms and therefore can attract adsorbates. The exact nature of the bonding depends on the details of the species involved, but the adsorption process is generally classified as physisorption (characteristic of weak van der Waals forces) or chemisorption (characteristic of covalent bonding). It may also occur due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E
25|$|Peridotites {{can take}} on a massive form or may be in layers. Layered peridotites may form the base layers of gabbroic complexes. Even though some layered peridotites appear to have no {{associated}} gabbro, they probably once were part of such a complex. Three main textures are found in peridotites: the first are well formed crystals of olivine surrounded by other minerals. These olivine crystals probably settled out of the magma first. Another texture is equal sized crystals with straight grain boundaries intersecting at 120°. This may result when slow cooling allowed recrystallization to minimize <b>surface</b> <b>energy.</b> A third texture has long crystals with ragged curvilinear boundaries, a result of internal deformation.|$|E
40|$|The {{calculation}} of the accurate <b>surface</b> <b>energies</b> for (0001) <b>surfaces</b> of wurtzite ZnO is difficult because {{it is impossible to}} decouple the two inequivalent (0001) -Zn and (000 [1 with combining macron]) -O surfaces. By using a heterojunction model we have transformed the uncertainty of the <b>surface</b> <b>energies</b> into that of interface energies which is much smaller than the former and hence estimated the <b>surface</b> <b>energies</b> to a high degree of accuracy. It is found that the oxygen terminated (000 [1 with combining macron]) -O face of the wurtzite phase and ([1 with combining macron][1 with combining macron][1 with combining macron]) -O of the zinc blende phase are more stable than their Zn-terminated counterparts within the major temperature and oxygen partial pressure range accessible to experiment. The instability of Zn-terminated polar surfaces explains the experimentally observed high activity of these surfaces. The effects of native surface vacancies on the <b>surface</b> <b>energies</b> have also been discussed. These results provide insights into the modification of the surface stability and activity of ZnO nanoparticles...|$|R
40|$|Anisotropic <b>surface</b> <b>energies</b> {{are used}} to model <b>surface</b> <b>energies</b> which depend on the {{direction}} of the surface normal. Equilibria of such energies are characterized as surfaces with constant anisotropic mean curvature. The surface of a crystal and certain interfaces of liquid crystals with an isotropic substrate give physical examples of such equilibria. We produce examples of surfaces having constant anisotropic mean curvature for anisotropic energy functionals having a Wulff shape based on the Gielis formula...|$|R

25|$|Micro-contact {{printing}} or {{soft lithography}} {{is analogous to}} printing ink with a rubber stamp. The SAM molecules are inked onto a pre-shaped elastomeric stamp with a solvent and transferred to the substrate surface by stamping. The SAM solution {{is applied to the}} entire stamp but only areas that make contact with the surface allow transfer of the SAMs. The transfer of the SAMs is a complex diffusion process that depends on the type of molecule, concentration, duration of contact, and pressure applied. Typical stamps use PDMS because its elastomeric properties, E = 1.8 MPa, allow it to fit the countour of micro surfaces and its low <b>surface</b> <b>energy,</b> γ = 21.6 dyn/cm². This is a parallel process and can thus place nanoscale objects over a large area in a short time.|$|E
25|$|The surface {{reflectance}} {{of incoming}} solar radiation {{is important for}} the <b>surface</b> <b>energy</b> balance (SEB). It is the ratio of reflected to incident solar radiation, commonly referred to as albedo. Climatologists are primarily interested in albedo integrated over the shortwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (~300 to 3500nm), which coincides with the main solar energy input. Typically, albedo values for non-melting snow-covered surfaces are high (~80-90%) except in the case of forests. The higher albedos for snow and ice cause rapid shifts in surface reflectivity in autumn and spring in high latitudes, but the overall climatic significance of this increase is spatially and temporally modulated by cloud cover. (Planetary albedo is determined principally by cloud cover, and by the small amount of total solar radiation received in high latitudes during winter months.) Summer and autumn are times of high-average cloudiness over the Arctic Ocean so the albedo feedback associated with the large seasonal changes in sea-ice extent is greatly reduced. Groisman et al. (1994a) observed that snow cover exhibited the greatest influence on the Earth radiative balance in the spring (April to May) period when incoming solar radiation was greatest over snow-covered areas.|$|E
500|$|Dynamic {{surfaces}} {{have been}} reported that undergo changes in <b>surface</b> <b>energy</b> upon the application of an appropriate stimuli.

500|$|Studies have {{evaluated}} {{that global}} warming can result in higher observed intensities of tropical cyclones {{as a result of}} deviations in the <b>surface</b> <b>energy</b> flux and atmospheric composition, which both heavily influence the development of medicanes as well. In tropical and subtropical areas, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) rose [...] within a 50-year period, and in the North Atlantic and Western Pacific tropical cyclone basins, the potential destructiveness and energy of storms nearly doubled within the same duration, evidencing a clear correlation between global warming and tropical cyclone intensities. Within a similarly recent 20-year period, SSTs in the Mediterranean Sea increased by , though no observable increase in medicane activity has been noted, as of yet. In 2006, a computer-driven atmospheric model evaluated the future frequency of Mediterranean cyclones between 2071 and 2100, projecting a decrease in autumn, winter, and spring cyclonic activity coinciding with a dramatic increase in formation near Cyprus, with both scenarios attributed to elevated temperatures as a result of global warming. Other studies, however, have been inconclusive, forecasting both increases and decreases in duration, number, and intensity. Three independent studies, using different methodologies and data, evaluated that while medicane activity would likely decline with a rate depending on the climate scenario considered, a higher percentage of those that formed would be of greater strength.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} relaxations, <b>surface</b> <b>energies,</b> and work {{functions}} of low index metallic surfaces using pseudopotential plane-wave density-functional calculations within the generalized gradient approximation. We study here the (100), (110), and (111) surfaces of Al, Pd, Pt, and Au and the (0001) surface of Ti, chosen {{for their use}} as contact or lead materials in nanoscale devices. We consider clean, mostly non-reconstructed surfaces in the slab-supercell approximation. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the convergence of these quantities with respect to slab thickness; furthermore, different methodologies for the calculation of work functions and <b>surfaces</b> <b>energies</b> are compared. We find that the use of bulk references for calculations of <b>surface</b> <b>energies</b> and work functions can be detrimental to convergence unless numerical grids are closely matched, especially when surface relaxations are being considered. Our results and comparison show that calculated values often do not quantitatively match experimental values. This may be understandable for the surface relaxations and <b>surface</b> <b>energies,</b> where experimental values can have large error, but even for the work functions, neither local nor semi-local functionals emerge as an accurate choice for every case.
