25|$|In Honduras {{support to}} {{community}} organizations (Juntas de Agua) is entrusted to the <b>Social</b> <b>Fund</b> FHIS, {{in cooperation with}} a national agency for technical assistance in water and sanitation (SANAA). In El Salvador it {{is done by the}} <b>Social</b> <b>Fund</b> FISDL and various NGOs. In Peru it is carried out through NGOs and municipalities with the support of a national program (PRONASAR) implemented by the Ministry of Housing. In Paraguay {{it is the responsibility of}} a national agency in charge of promoting specifically water supply and sanitation in rural areas and small towns (SENASA). In Ecuador it is carried out under a national program (PRAGUAS) by consultants working for the Ministry of Housing. In Panama such support is provided by the Ministry of Health. In Haiti such support is provided by NGOs, some of which are under contract with the national urban water agency SNEP and its specialized unit for rural areas. There thus is a wide variety of institutional arrangements to support community organizations, so that one cannot speak of a uniform model for such support in Latin America.|$|E

In this context, this paper emphasizes the importance-and limitations-of the underlying poverty analysis informing the design of <b>social</b> <b>funds,</b> particularly the identification of beneficiaries.

Each evaluation reviewed the <b>social</b> <b>fund’s</b> poverty targeting, sustainability, welfare impacts, and costs. One of the evaluation's main conclusions was that the <b>Social</b> <b>Funds</b> evaluated were indeed effective at reaching the poor and extremely poor communities and households, something that had been disputed given allegedly limited capabilities of poor communities to manage funds and execute sub-projects.|$|R

25|$|Supporting the {{numerous}} community organizations that provide {{water and sanitation}} services in Latin America - mainly in rural areas - is a key public function that is often underestimated and neglected. Responsibility for this function, if it is defined at all, can be assigned to a government Ministry and its regional branches, a <b>Social</b> <b>Fund</b> or municipalities. Often NGOs also carry out this function, either on their own initiative and with their own resources, or under contract by the government.|$|E

40|$|While {{acknowledging}} {{the role of}} <b>Social</b> <b>Funds</b> in making effective investments to meet community needs, this study focuses on another crucial dimension: their impact on overall public sector management. The key question addressed {{is the role of}} <b>social</b> <b>funds</b> in building institutional capacity for designing, implementing, and delivering economic and social services. The areas considered for analysis include autonomy, budgetary issues, accountability, political interference, the effects on decentralization, the long-term role of <b>social</b> <b>funds,</b> and exit strategies. The study reveals that a clear vision of the role of <b>social</b> <b>funds</b> with respect to other public and private institutions, can help in a program design that integrates public sector management and institutional issues into all stages of the project cycle. More specifically, the study recommends that <b>social</b> <b>funds</b> be designed to act as catalysts toward public sector reforms, by grafting their positive features and incentives onto government structures. ...|$|R

25|$|There are {{hundreds}} of water committees, called CAEPAs (Comités d'Aprovisionnement en Eau Potable et d'Assainissement) or simply Comités d'Eau, in charge of water systems in rural areas and some small towns. They consist of elected community members. Their degree of formalization and effectiveness varies considerably. The best water committees meet regularly, closely interact with the community, regularly collect revenues, hire a plumber who performs routine repairs, have a bank account and are registered and approved by DINEPA. However, many water committees fall short of these expectations. There is no national or regional registry of water committees or water systems {{and there are no}} associations of water committees at the municipal, departmental or national level. Another public entity that invests in water supply is FAES, a <b>Social</b> <b>fund.</b>|$|E
25|$|An Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Program Project {{supported}} by a US$150 million World Bank credit, approved in August 2002, aims at efficient and sustainable water and sanitation services in major urban areas. Their project has three components. The first rehabilitates and expands the {{water supply and sanitation}} infrastructure. The second component supports institutional restructuring and improving managerial capacities of local corporations; and to put in place an appropriate structure for a regulatory body for the urban water and sanitation sector in Yemen. A Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project—with US$20 million approved in December 2000 and additional financing of US$20 million approved in January 2008—aims to expand sustainable rural water supply and sanitation service coverage to mostly poor rural dwellers in ten governorates. Until 2007, 140 water sub-projects serving a population of 320,000 were completed. In addition, three consecutive <b>Social</b> <b>fund</b> for Development Projects financed partly by the World Bank allocated an estimated 15% for rural water supply and sanitation.|$|E
25|$|Since {{joining the}} EU in 1973, Ireland has {{received}} over €17 billion in EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. These {{are made up}} of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European <b>Social</b> <b>Fund</b> (ESF) and were used to increase investment in the education system and to build physical infrastructure. These transfer payments from members of the European Union, such as Germany and France, were as high as 4% of Ireland's gross national product (GNP). Ireland is unique among cohesion countries, having allocated up to 35% of its Structural Funds to human resource investments, compared with an average of around 25% for other cohesion fund recipients. The Irish economy's increased productive capacity is sometimes attributed to these investments, which made Ireland more attractive to high-tech businesses, though the libertarian Cato Institute has suggested that the EU transfer payments were economically inefficient and may have actually slowed growth. The conservative Heritage Foundation also attributed to transfer payments no significant role in causing growth.|$|E

25|$|A {{wide range}} of social reforms were carried out during Moro's periods as prime minister. The 1967 Ponte Law (Legge Ponte) {{introduced}} urgent housing provisions {{as part of an}} envisioned reform of the entire sector, such as the introduction of minimum standards for housing and environment. A law promulgated on 14 December 1963 introduced an annual allowance for university students with income below a given level. Another law, promulgated on 10 March 1968, introduced voluntary public pre-elementary education for children aged three to five years. A law promulgated on 21 July 1965 introduced new pension provisions under the general scheme. The legal minima was raised, all current pensions were revalued, seniority pensions (pensioni d’anzianità) were introduced (after 35 years of contributions workers could retire even before attaining pensionable age), and within the national social security institution (Istituto nazionale della previdenza sociale), a <b>Social</b> <b>Fund</b> (Fondo Sociale) was established, ensuring to all members pensioners a basic uniform pension largely financed by state, known as the social pension (not related to the later social pension introduced in 1968). A law of 22 July 1966 extended pension insurance to small traders. A law of 22 July 1966 extended health insurance to retired traders, and a law of 29 May 1967 extended compulsory health insurance to retired farmers, tenant farmers, and sharecroppers, and extended health insurance to the unemployed in receipt of unemployment benefits. A law of 18 March 1968 introduced the principle of earnings-related pensions within the general scheme, with the pension formula to equal 1.626% of average earnings in the last 3 years of work multiplied by the number of contribution years (maximum pension: 65% of previous earnings) up to 40. A law of 5 November 1968 extended family allowances to the unemployed in receipt of unemployment benefits.|$|E
