5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the leakages, but the substance failed to work properly. Not only did it fail to polymerize and stop the leaks, it also contaminated the surroundings with acrylamide. The entire process of fixing the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed {{the process of building}} the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed in 1995, and were never taken <b>seriously.</b> <b>About</b> sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel. An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was used on fixing the leaks; however, the report claimed this was, to a large extent, a waste of money due to inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the entire construction of the railway.|$|E

25|$|Memoirs written {{after the}} period of captivity are of an entirely {{different}} sort. These later writings became the place where a profound reflection on the situation could be made, something less suitable for the daily diaries. Following the example of Gaston Riou in France, some prisoners became writers or resumed their occupation as writers. In 1924, Thierry Sandre won the Prix Goncourt for three volumes, {{one of which was}} his captivity narrative, Le Purgatoire. Some of these authors entered the literary tradition: in Le Purgatoire, for instance, Sandre dedicates each chapter to influential members of the era’s literary society such as Claude Farrère or Christian-Frogé, secretary of the Association des écrivains combattants. Robert d'Harcourt, who had also been a prisoner, published a memoir that was reprinted several times. Jacques Rivière is one of the authors who thought <b>seriously</b> <b>about</b> the meaning of captivity. In his book L’Allemand (“The German”), reprinted in 1924, the reader finds a thorough psychological and philosophical analysis of the former enemy.|$|E

25|$|Strongheart's mother, Chi-Nach-Lut Schu-Wah-Elks, was {{a member}} of the Yakama Nation. He was exposed to native culture through {{performing}} with his father in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show and its successors; according to some sources Strongheart spent most of his childhood with his white father away from the reservation and Indian culture; other sources say he was adopted by a Yakima woman, and brought up and educated on the reservation. Strongheart's public performances began in 1917 when he worked for the YMCA War Work Council. He toured military camps across New England, where he gave presentations on Native American culture and spoke <b>seriously</b> <b>about</b> military service. His talks encouraged hundreds of men to volunteer for war service. After World War I and his job ended, Strongheart moved briefly to the Yakama Indian Reservation but left again and had a successful career in the Lyceum and Chautauqua circuits of fairs, where he gave presentations on Native American culture and often spoke against the reservation lifestyle enforced by government policy. He played an important role in the development of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 signed by President Calvin Coolidge, which he thought would help end reservations and empower Indian culture.|$|E
500|$|Side two {{contains}} a 16-minute medley of eight short songs, recorded over July and August and blended into a suite by McCartney and Martin. Some songs were written (and originally recorded in demo form) during sessions for the White Album and Get Back/ Let It Be, which later appeared on Anthology 3. While {{the idea for}} the medley was McCartney's, Martin claims credit for some structure, adding he [...] "wanted to get John and Paul to think more <b>seriously</b> <b>about</b> their music".|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 essay {{published}} in the online journal Flow, Shana Agid, a transgender student at Sarah Lawrence College, wondered whether programs like TransGeneration [...] "take away from other possibilities for change" [...] if—in {{an effort to make}} queer subject matter [...] "straight-friendly" [...] and [...] "consumable"—they only represent transgender people who fit a certain narrative and adhere to a gender binary. Like Agid, Todd Ramlow of PopMatters lamented the production's fixation on binary gender, but he found positive qualities in its presentation of some of the struggles and anxieties a transgender person might experience. [...] "It prods us to think <b>seriously</b> <b>about</b> transgender issues, and to… create more inclusive communities." [...] In his final analysis, he gave the series three stars out of ten.|$|E

500|$|Peng {{participated in}} a failed mutiny over pay, but was pardoned. In August 1921 Peng was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} second lieutenant, and became acting company commander several weeks later. While stationed in a village in Nanxian, Peng noticed that the poor were being mistreated by a local landlord, and encouraged them to establish an [...] "association to help the poor". When the local villagers hesitated, Peng ordered his soldiers to arrest the landlord and execute him. Peng was reprimanded for his actions, but not demoted or reassigned. After the incident, Peng began to think <b>seriously</b> <b>about</b> leaving the service of his provincial warlord army. In February 1922, after applying for extended unpaid leave, Peng and several other officers traveled to Guangdong to seek employment in the army of the Kuomintang.|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky was {{inspired}} to reach beyond Russia with his music, according to Maes and Taruskin. His exposure to Western music, they write, encouraged him to think it belonged not just to Russia but to the world at large. Volkov adds that this mindset made him think <b>seriously</b> <b>about</b> Russia's place in European musical culture—the first Russian composer to do so. It steeled him {{to become the first}} Russian composer to personally acquaint foreign audiences with his own works, Warrack writes, {{as well as those of}} other Russian composers. In his biography of Tchaikovsky, Anthony Holden recalls the dearth of Russian classical music before Tchaikovsky's birth, then places the composer's achievements into historical perspective: [...] "Twenty years after Tchaikovsky's death, in 1913, Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring erupted onto the musical scene, signalling Russia's arrival into 20th-century music. Between these two very different worlds Tchaikovsky's music became the sole bridge." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode also reintroduced the storyline of Paul Young and Felicia Tilman's rivalry. Mark Moses {{returned}} to the series as a series regular after appearing briefly as Paul in the sixth season finale. On his return, Moses commented, [...] "There was some talk about [...] a year ago. And there’s often talk in Hollywood. Sometimes it pans out, sometimes it doesn’t. I don’t get super-excited about a 'maybe' in this town, because {{there are lots of}} maybes that don’t happen. But then this last year they called up my agent and said, 'We're really thinking <b>seriously</b> <b>about</b> [...]' And eventually, they made an offer, and I was very pleased." [...] Harriet Samson Harris also {{returned to}} reprise her role as Felicia, while Steven Culp and Christine Estabrook returned as Rex Van de Kamp and Martha Huber respectively in flashback sequences. Kyle MacLachlan, who left Desperate Housewives as a series regular at the end of season six, reprised his role as Orson Hodge in this episode.|$|E

500|$|Historian Michael Wolffsohn {{supports}} the Ministry of Defense's decision to continue recognition of Rommel, although {{he thinks the}} focus should {{be put on the}} later stage of Rommel's life, when he began thinking more <b>seriously</b> <b>about</b> war and politics, and broke with the regime. MDR reports that, [...] "Wolffsohn declares the Bundeswehr wants to have politically thoughtful, responsible officers from the beginning, thus a tradition of 'swashbuckler' and 'humane rescuer' is not intended". According to authors like Ulrich vom Hagen and Sandra Mass though, the Bundeswehr (as well as NATO) deliberately endorses the ideas of chivalrous warfare and apolitical soldiering associated with Rommel. According to Cornelia Hecht, the Bundeswehr believes that [...] "chivalry and fairness", which Rommel embodied more than any other Wehrmacht generals, are timeless military virtues. At a Ministry conference soliciting input on the matter, Dutch general Ton van Loon advised the Ministry that, although there can be historical abuses hidden under the guise of military tradition, tradition is still essential for the esprit de corps and part of that tradition should be the leadership and achievements of Rommel.|$|E

Greenland was so impressed with the story that, without Clarke's knowledge, he sent an excerpt to his friend, the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman. Gaiman later said, [...] "It was terrifying {{from my point of view}} to read this first short story that had so much assurance...It was like watching someone sit down to play the piano for the first time and she plays a sonata." [...] Gaiman showed the story to his friend, science-fiction writer and editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden. Clarke learned of these events when Nielsen Hayden called and offered to publish her story in his anthology Starlight 1 (1996), which featured pieces by well-regarded science-fiction and fantasy writers. She accepted, and the book won the World Fantasy Award for best anthology in 1997.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The naïve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning {{a little bit more about}} how people live. And then the end is a little bit of growing up, starting to think more <b>seriously</b> <b>about</b> your life and your faith. If people could look at our three albums as a bildungsroman, I’d be O.K. with that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive to shrug off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|E

The former two started discussing about the latter's relationship who also joined them after hearing their opinions. Their discussions were similar to the lyrical content of the song with the two trying to convince her the relationship is wrong and the latter defending her love interest. After the interlude finished, the group appeared onstage performing [...] "Girl" [...] mixing it with [...] "I'll Take You There". While reviewing a concert in the UK, Adenike Adenitire of MTV News praised the performance, concluding [...] "They borrowed the 'Sex and the City' theme for the 'Girl' video, but they lean more toward 'Girlfriends' when taking it on the road, with a light comedy moment that may see TV execs thinking <b>seriously</b> <b>about</b> a Destiny's Child sitcom." [...] In contrast, Barbara Ellen of The Observer criticized the segment during which [...] "Girl" [...] was performed, writing [...] "... no amount of 'girlpower' rabble-rousing can disguise the fact the songs are wet-paper-bag weak; giving the impression of three bored young women dozing off at a slumber party, whining in their jim-jams about men who 'done them wrong', or men who 'done someone else wrong', or just men doing wrong, period."
