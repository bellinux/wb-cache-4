25|$|Nabarro–Herring creep is {{strongly}} temperature dependent. For lattice diffusion of atoms {{to occur in}} a material, neighboring lattice sites or interstitial sites in the crystal structure must be free. A given atom must also overcome the energy barrier to move from its current site (it lies in an energetically favorable potential well) to the nearby vacant site (another potential well). The general form of the diffusion equation is D = D0exp(E/KT) where D0 has a dependence on both the attempted jump frequency {{and the number of}} nearest neighbor sites and the probability of the sites being vacant. Thus there is a double dependence upon temperature. At higher temperatures the diffusivity increases due to the direct temperature dependence of the equation, the increase in vacancies through <b>Schottky</b> <b>defect</b> formation, and an increase in the average energy of atoms in the material. Nabarro–Herring creep dominates at very high temperatures relative to a material's melting temperature.|$|E

Comparisons were made between the density functional theory results and results obtained from empirical potential simulations and these generally showed good agreement. Both methodologies predicted the first nearest neighbor <b>Schottky</b> <b>defects</b> to be the most energetically favorable of the considered <b>Schottky</b> <b>defects</b> and that the first, second, and fifth nearest neighbor di-interstitials were of similar energy and were favored over the other di-interstitial configurations. Relaxed structures of the defects were analyzed, which showed that empirical potential simulations were accurately predicting the displacements of atoms surrounding di-interstitials, but were overestimating O atom displacement for <b>Schottky</b> <b>defects.</b> Transition barriers were computed for the defects using the nudged elastic band method. Vacancies and <b>Schottky</b> <b>defects</b> were found to have relatively high energy barriers, the majority of which were over 2 eV, in agreement with conclusions reached using empirical potentials. The lowest barriers for di-interstitial transitions were found to be for migration into a first nearest neighbor configuration. Charges were calculated using a Bader analysis and this found negligible charge transfer during the defect transitions and only small changes in the charges on atoms surrounding defects, indicating why fixed charge models work as well as they do...|$|R

Here, the role of intrinsic defects in the above mentioned processes inside rock salt (RS) lead chalcogenide systems PbS, PbSe and PbTe (PbX) was studied systematically using first principles density functional theory. Vacancy, interstitial, <b>Schottky</b> and Frenkel <b>defects</b> were considered. Rock salt PbO was included for comparison.

50|$|If in an {{ionic crystal}} of type A+B− {{an equal number}} of cations and anions are missing from their lattice sites (so that {{electrical}} neutrality as well as stoichiometry is maintained), then this defect is called a <b>Schottky</b> <b>defect.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>Schottky</b> <b>defect</b> is an {{intrinsic}} point defect that creates vacancies {{on both the}} cation and anion sublattices. This defect occurs in ionic crystals when one (positively charged) cation and one (negatively charged) anion leave the lattice simultaneously, resulting in two vacant lattice sites. Because the mass, site, and charge must remain balanced, these vacancies always occur in stoichiometric ratios.

50|$|Similarly to a <b>Schottky</b> <b>defect,</b> a Frenkel defect is an {{intrinsic}} point defect {{that produces a}} vacancy site on either the cation or anion sublattice along with an interstitial site on that same lattice. In an ionic crystal, this occurs when a cation or anion leaves its site in the sublattice, creating the vacancy, and moves to another location to create an interstitial. These Frenkel defect pairs maintain a balanced mass, site, and charge ratio throughout the relocation of the ions. Since the movement remains within the material's single lattice, the density remains the same.|$|E
50|$|Vacancy defects are lattice sites {{which would}} be {{occupied}} in a perfect crystal, but are vacant. If a neighboring atom moves to occupy the vacant site, the vacancy moves {{in the opposite direction}} to the site which used to be occupied by the moving atom. The stability of the surrounding crystal structure guarantees that the neighboring atoms will not simply collapse around the vacancy. In some materials, neighboring atoms actually move away from a vacancy, because they experience attraction from atoms in the surroundings. A vacancy (or pair of vacancies in an ionic solid) is sometimes called a <b>Schottky</b> <b>defect.</b>|$|E

The most stable self-interstitials are all found in the hexahedral position surrounded by two Ti(2) and three Si atoms. For the entire elemental chemical potential range considered, our results demonstrated that Si and C related defects, including vacancies, interstitials and Frenkel defects are the most dominant defects. Besides, the present calculations also reveal that the formation energies of C and Si Frenkel defects are much lower than those of all <b>Schottky</b> <b>defects</b> considered. In addition, the calculated profiles of densities of states for the defective Ti 3 SiC 2 indicate that these defects should have great influence on its thermal and electrical properties.

40|$|The {{energetics}} of {{formation of}} isolated vacancies {{in a family}} of CsCl type crystals (the halides of caesium, thallium and ammonium) are reexamined by using an energy minimisation approach. An increased relaxation and decreased electronic moment of the nearest neighbour ions resulted in overall energy terms leading to values of <b>Schottky</b> <b>defect</b> formation energies which are consistently larger relative to the previous results (1). Comparison with ionic conductivity and diffusion studies suggests that the transport properties in caesium and thallous halides may be understood in terms of <b>Schottky</b> <b>defect</b> mechanisms.

40|$|Defects and the {{incorporation}} of volatile fission products (xenon, krypton, caesium and iodine) in uranium mononitride are investigated using DFT calculations.

5|$|Within an ionic crystal, {{there will}} usually be some point defects, but to {{maintain}} electroneutrality, these defects come in pairs. Frenkel defects {{consist of a}} cation vacancy paired with a cation interstitial and can be generated anywhere in {{the bulk of the}} crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a low coordination number and cations that are much smaller than the anions. <b>Schottky</b> <b>defects</b> consist of one vacancy of each type, and are generated at the surfaces of a crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a high coordination number and when the anions and cations are of similar size. If the cations have multiple possible oxidation states, then it is possible for cation vacancies to compensate for electron deficiencies on cation sites with higher oxidation numbers, resulting in a non-stoichiometric compound. Another non-stoichiometric possibility is the formation of an F-center, a free electron occupying an anion vacancy. When the compound has three or more ionic components, even more defect types are possible. All of these point defects can be generated via thermal vibrations and have an equilibrium concentration. Because they are energetically costly, but entropically beneficial, they occur in greater concentration at higher temperatures. Once generated, these pairs of defects can diffuse mostly independently of one another, by hopping between lattice sites. This defect mobility is the source of most transport phenomena within an ionic crystal, including diffusion and solid state ionic conductivity. When vacancies collide with interstitials (Frenkel), they can recombine and annihilate one another. Similarly vacancies are removed when they reach the surface of the crystal (<b>Schottky).</b> <b>Defects</b> in the crystal structure generally expand the lattice parameters, reducing the overall density of the crystal. Defects also result in ions in distinctly different local environments, which causes them to experience a different crystal-field symmetry, {{especially in the case of}} different cations exchanging lattice sites. This results in a different splitting of d-electron orbitals, so that the optical absorption (and hence colour) can change with defect concentration.|$|R
