40|$|Low cost, {{reliable}} and durable solutions are required in all industries. In automotive industry, BLDC (Brushless Direct Current) motors {{are widely used}} due to its advantages over brushed DC motors, which also brings more complex commutation schemes and increased development cost. Despite the fact, BLDC motors require low maintenance and provide reliable results in compare with brushed DC motors, the cost of development of control stage and required hardware topology has been a competence area. The requirements of the application tailor the required hardware topology and control strategy. In this thesis, BLDC motor commutation control hardware topologies to implement a BLDC motor based air throttle control circuit, power dissipation and EMC considerations are addressed. BLDC motor control of a throttle were chosen as a test case due to Scania requirements. An air throttle adjusts the air intake going to a combustion engine, thus directly e ecting the performance. The better controlling the throttle means, providing reliable results with lower consumption of energy. The throttle chosen is an intelligent self positioning unit being bought from a <b>sub-supplier</b> and Scania steers the control {{by means of an}} angle position reference sent via CAN (Controller Area Network) bus. The <b>sub-supplier</b> solution results in lack of exibility in software and hardware implementation and lacking possible customization improvements. A customized hardware solution was implemented to question whether a custom hardware implementation and a control strategy planned by Scania can resolve in less power consumption. In addition, what is required to make the throttle unit better should be reected. For this purpose,a customized commutation control circuit was built and a benchmarking in compare with the original <b>sub-supplier</b> solution were done to enable comparison and discussion on possible improvements. One unit of <b>sub-supplier</b> and one unit of customized hardware were benchmarked with respect to heat dissipation, current consumption at the time angle is settled and EMI (Electromagnetic Interference). The results showed that the given Scania control strategy may yield in decreased current consumption, thus reduced heat dissipation. Despite the fact the results are prospective, from a scientic point of view, a comprehensive long term benchmarking should be done with multiple units. The outcomes of this project are a hardware platform which {{can be used as a}} development platform to further enable comparison and development, partially proven Scania control strategy to reduce dissipation and enabling cumulative future work in form of diagnostics...|$|R

In November and December 2012, the Investigating Committee interrogated and questioned Yves Rocher Vostok. On December 10, Bruno Leproux, general director of Yves Rocher Vostok, filed to the Investigative Committee, asking to investigate if the Glavpodpiska subscription company had damaged Yves Rocher Vostok, and the Investigative Committee initiated a case. The prosecution claimed Glavpodpiska embezzled money by taking duties and then redistributing them to other companies for lesser amounts of money, and collecting the surplus: 26.7 million rubles ($540,000) from Yves Rocher Vostok, and 4.4 million rubles from the MPC. The funds were claimed to be subsequently legalized by transferring them on fictitious grounds from a fly-by-night company to Kobyakovskaya Fabrika Po Lozopleteniyu, a willow weaving company founded by Navalny and operated by his parents.

40|$|Customers of the {{aerospace}} company studied act primarily as system integrators today. This {{means that the}} company studied {{is expected to take}} full responsibility for a component or sub-system, including developing new innovative technologies within their specializations. For a supplier, the global trends and general expectations of the industry may be reasonably clear, but how this should be translated to technology development is not necessarily a clear-cut process. This includes anticipating market trends, how the customers of the company are positioning themselves in relation to global trends and regulations, the overarching system architecture that could be chosen by an aircraft supplier, and various forms of possible collaboration driven by market forces and political arrangements. The difficulties for a company acting as a <b>sub-supplier</b> under these uncertain circumstances, to propose a logical and solid technology strategy are obviously not easily managed. This paper reports a case study on how selected aspects of technology management interact and how they shape the development and decision making processes within a particular company acting as component supplier in {{the aerospace}} sector. To explore the management of technology, focus group interviews were used. A total of seven groups were interviewed for approximately two hours each. For the composition of these groups, a purposeful homogeneous sampling strategy was chosen to find the people with the greatest insight on this topic and to focus on the variation in perspectives of internal organizations. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, informal methods for data reduction were used to condense the material, and the results and conclusions were presented to the participants and other interested parties at the company to improve clarity and eliminate error. The study explores a process of technology maturation and implementation. Experience gained from aspects such as identification, selection, planning, execution and introduction of new technology was discussed. The overall vision of the general management is translated into requirements and goals for new technology. This process is highly cross functional, with different organizational groups contributing in various ways to develop the technology.

40|$|Product {{development}} {{is one of}} the most important activities in an industrial company, in order to strengthen the position at the market and achieve competitive advantages. Companies are under pressure to bring new products to the market faster, at a lower cost and with increased performance. In this demanding environment, companies frequently focus on their core competencies, search for external complementary knowledge and look for partners who can share the risk and cost, in order to stay competitive. Increased outsourcing results in a need to co-ordinate the work between multiple actors. Distributed product {{development is}} also dependent on the ability to manage information exchange between interfaces for upstream and downstream tasks, different sub-systems and different organisational functions. The overall objective of this research is to enhance the knowledge of how <b>sub-suppliers</b> can be integrated with main suppliers and to provide guidelines and support for distributed product development. This research focuses on the distributed product development system, primarily on the relationship between main and <b>sub-suppliers.</b> Increased complexity stresses the need for models and methods that can be used for design teams to develop a shared understanding. In order to deal with this demand a holistic view is needed. This research applies a combination of systems theory and an actors' approach, with the aim of dealing with complex problems. The results of this research are based on six different case studies, presented in seven appended papers. This research presents an interface model that can be used for main and <b>sub-suppliers,</b> with a structured procedure for improving their collaboration. This research work also contains increased knowledge for what the <b>sub-suppliers</b> can do in order to be integrated with the main supplier. A model for analysing the knowledge process between main and <b>sub-suppliers</b> has been developed. The potential for better utilising the sub-suppliers' knowledge has been confirmed. A phenomena model has been developed that could support distributed product development. The model aims for a common understanding of involved stakeholders, requirements, functions and sub-systems during the design of the product. The knowledge of integrated product and process modelling has been further developed, in order to bridge, or at least minimise, the gap between product and process domain. The results have industrial relevance as well.

40|$|The Dutch {{shipbuilding}} {{industry has}} a real competitive force in building complex, specialized and multipurpose vessels (Rabobank, 2014). However, the Dutch maritime sector {{has to deal with}} strongly growing competition worldwide. For the dredging sector this implies the need to innovate in order to remain competitive. This research focuses on the strategy of vertical forward cooperation to do so; the supplier will move into the maintenance aspects of dredging equipment, benefiting both the client and the supplier by expanding their services. This led to the research question of how a supplier of dredging equipment can achieve forward cooperation in the product life cycle. As a case study the company of Royal IHC is used for this research, in specific the product type of the IHC Beaver dredger is discussed. The research is divided into six parts; (i) a literature study; where the possible strategies for the forward cooperation are studied; a case study, where the (ii) IST (current) situation and the (iii) SOLL (ideal) situation are defined according to the current situation at IHC and a benchmark study. A system characterization for warranty cost analysis by D. N. P. Murthy and W. R. Blischke (2006) that describes how warranty policy, product reliability and product usage ultimately influence the warranty costs is used to structure these situations. Then a GAP analysis follows (iv) where the IST and SOLL are compared. This leads to the (v) fifth part of the research: the framework on how to achieve forward cooperation, which is supported with a model. Finally (vi) the conclusions and recommendations are given. Firstly the current situation (IST) is researched in which the IHC Beaver is provided with one-year warranty at sale. Two important groups of stakeholders are the clients and the <b>sub-suppliers.</b> For the procurement of parts the role of the <b>sub-suppliers</b> is essential because they deliver over 60 % of the parts of the Beaver dredger. How agreements are made with <b>sub-suppliers</b> on the warranty period of the supplied parts is therefore essential when IHC has the intention to apply forward cooperation in the future. After the IST situation the ideal situation (SOLL) is defined. Forward cooperation can be achieved with different strategies; with the properties of the dredging market and the intention to achieve forward cooperation in the product life cycle of a standard industrial product, extended warranty has the best characteristics. Compared to the IST situation with base-warranty it is concluded that several uncertainties arise when extending the warranty with 5 years. The result of these uncertainties is that the usage and the reliability of the product cannot be predicted. This is a high risk for the supplier that will be translated in high warranty costs. In the perfect SOLL situation however most of the variables will become fixed, known or manageable. Resulting from the GAP analysis several actions that influence the warranty costs for the supplier are summarized; develop a new warranty policy, conduct a research into the product reliability and develop a method to control the product usage {{to reduce the risk of}} intensive or improper use. To implement forward cooperation this is what needs to be done; develop a structure where the variables ‘product reliability’ and ‘product usage’ determine the warranty costs and where the ‘warranty policy’ is the last variable to define the definitive ‘warranty costs’. Thereby the ‘warranty policy’ should also influence the ‘product usage’. With the knowledge of the literature and the case study the following changes are made to the original model of D. N. P. Murthy and W. R. Blischke (2006) to create the eventual framework; (i) the supplier is now considered an integrator; (ii) cooperation with the <b>sub-suppliers</b> (backwards cooperation) is included; (iii) the warranty policies control the warranty costs by in- or excluding parts, non- or renewing warranty and a possible decrease in the coverage of warranty costs for the integrator over time; (iv) the product usage is influenced by the warranty policy so that the usage risks are (more) controlled by the integrator. In the framework in figure 1 the warranty costs are completely dependent of the product performance, which in turn is determined by the product reliability and the product usage. To make a reliable estimation of the covered warranty costs it is of great importance that both the product reliability and the product usage are known. Furthermore the framework shows that the supplier of dredging equipment can rather be seen as an ‘integrator’ that relies on the products of <b>sub-suppliers,</b> therefore the supplier of dredging equipment needs to apply backward cooperation to achieve forward integration. To be able to influence the warranty costs the supplier of dredging equipment needs to offer several warranty policies that suit the product usage profile of the client. By providing different options the supplier is able to reduce the financial risks and the expected warranty costs. Before the supplier of dredging equipment is able to offer the extended warranty, it is highly recommended to take these actions that will form the basis for the extended warranty service; (1) start logging data on product usage and product reliability; (2) cooperate and negotiate with the sub-suppliers; (3) investigate the failure mode of all parts and systems; (4) determine the warranty cost (modelling); (5) define the warranty policies and apply these to determine the covered warranty costs. Only when these actions are undertaken extended warranty can be successfully implemented by the supplier of dredging equipment.

They also identify several contingency variables (e. g. power, dependency, distance, industry, knowledge resources) and their effect on the proposed approaches. Research limitations/implications - Based on the framework, six research propositions that advance the theories on multi-tier supply chain management, allow lead firms to develop comprehensive sustainable supply chain strategies and set the ground for future research in the area were developed. Originality/value - This study provides a novel framework for studying sustainability in multi-tier supply chains that goes beyond the single-tier perspective and incorporates the extended supply chain...|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{estimating}} the direct, indirect and total effects of the supply-in-return on the Slovenian economy in the period 2004 – 2008, we use the input-output modelling on the 60 input-output sectors statistical table. The indirect effects of the supply-in-return are three-to-four {{times greater than the}} direct effects. The results confirm that the system of supply-in-return can be to a greater extent used for implementation of the development objectives, which are defined by the Strategy of Development of the Republic of Slovenia. The supply-in-return activities are important in the formation and development of the national industrial base, for a niche approach in setting up, maintaining, and catching up on the high-technological base of the domestic suppliers and <b>sub-suppliers</b> for industry abroad, for balance of payments clearance of financial flows due to imports of military products and equipment with largely high technological exports of civilian goods and services, for a balanced long-term sustainable regional development by increasing utilisation of national production capacities, and for adjustments to higher quality standards in production-service activities of civil origin. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Problem Little {{research}} has been conducted on how packaging and returnable packaging are managed within suppliers in the Scandinavian automotive supply chain. Sources also propose that returnable packaging is dealt with inefficiently within the automotive suppliers.    Purpose The purpose of the thesis is to explore and analyze how packaging and returnable packaging are managed within suppliers in the ASC. It also aims to identify perceived important factors for efficient returnable packaging management from the perspective of suppliers, <b>sub-suppliers</b> and OEMs. Method The research is based on a holistic single case study. Further, it adopts the inductive approach and exploratory purpose. Data collection is facilitated by qualitative methods, using ten semi-structured interviews and four on-site observations. Conclusion Packaging was found to be managed somewhat differently in the internal, outbound and inbound flows. Non-returnable and returnable packaging was found used in all flows at different ratios. Further, several factors were regarded important for efficient returnable packaging management. These were found specific for the internal, outbound and inbound flows and further divided into fundamental and efficiency factors...|$|E
