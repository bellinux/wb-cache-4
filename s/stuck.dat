5|$|If a large insect is {{struggling}} in a web, Portia does not usually take the insect, but waits {{for up to}} a day until the insect stops struggling, even if the prey is thoroughly <b>stuck.</b> When an insect <b>stuck</b> in a web owned by P. labiata, P. schultzi or any regional variant of P. fimbriata, and next to a web spider's web, the web spider sometimes enters the Portia′s web, and the Portia pursues and catches the web spider.|$|E

5|$|After {{donating}} {{money to}} public television, Marge receives complimentary ballet tickets. She asks Homer to accompany her, {{and much to}} Marge's surprise he agrees, confusing ballet with a circus. On {{the day of the}} ballet, however, he inadvertently gets his arm <b>stuck</b> in a vending machine while trying to steal a can of soda from it and then gets his other arm <b>stuck</b> in a candy machine, and so is unable to attend the ballet. In disbelief about Homer's story, Marge invites her neighbor, Ruth Powers to attend with her. They both enjoy themselves and arrange to go out again the next night. Marge and Ruth's friendship annoys Homer, who feels Marge should be spending time with him instead. However, ignoring Homer's protests, Marge and Ruth visit bars and clubs in Springfield, and Ruth later shows Marge how to use a pistol.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{a torrent}} of Japanese fire, the Australians broke contact and made for the landing craft, {{bringing}} the wounded out with them. The embarkation took only five minutes, but as the vessels attempted to depart two of them, overloaded with about 60 men on board, ran aground and <b>stuck</b> fast. In an effort to lighten the load, several men volunteered to leave the craft, which enabled one of the vessels to float free. The other, however, remained <b>stuck.</b> Coming under attack from the Japanese, some of whom waded out and attacked {{the men in the}} vessel with grenades, the casualties mounted, with a number of men, including Downs, being either killed or lost overboard and subsequently listed as missing, presumed killed.|$|E

5|$|Florida {{honored the}} American {{alligator}} in 1987, but the Gators have titled the University of Florida's teams since 1911. In that year, a printer made a spur-of-the-moment decision to print an alligator emblem on {{a shipment of}} the schools football pennants; the mascot <b>stuck,</b> perhaps because the team captain's nickname was Gator.|$|E

5|$|HMS Neptune {{was laid}} down in 1873 for the Brazilian Navy {{under the name of}} Independencia by J & W Dudgeon in Cubitt Town, London. The {{shipyard}} attempted to launch her on 16 July 1874, but she <b>stuck</b> fast and did not budge. A second attempt was made on 30 July during which the ship got about one-third down the slipway and <b>stuck,</b> extensively damaging her bottom plating.

5|$|Little is {{revealed}} of Quatermass's early life {{during the course}} of the films and television series in which he appears. In The Quatermass Experiment, he at one point despairs that he should have <b>stuck</b> to his original career as a surveyor.|$|E
5|$|Metro {{services}} are being extended to important hubs {{in the cities}} that are close to offices, colleges, and tourist spots. This will facilitate easy conveyance for the citizens, who otherwise {{have to rely on}} public buses that are heavily crowded and are often <b>stuck</b> in traffic jams.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses {{also have}} an {{excellent}} sense of touch. The octopus's suction cups are equipped with chemoreceptors so the octopus can taste what it touches. Octopus arms do not become tangled or <b>stuck</b> to each other because the sensors recognise octopus skin and prevent self-attachment.|$|E
5|$|On March 19, 2013, a {{construction}} worker got <b>stuck</b> in waist-deep muck at the station site; he was extricated after four hours of rescue efforts, but nearly died after the incident.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, {{excavations}} at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles have yielded 100 tonnes of fossils from 600 species of flora and fauna, including several Columbian mammoths. Many of the fossils are {{the remains of}} animals that became <b>stuck</b> in asphalt puddles which seeped {{to the surface of}} the pits, 40,000 to 11,500 years ago. Dust and leaves likely concealed the liquid asphalt, which then trapped unwary animals. Mired animals died from hunger or exhaustion; their corpses attracted predators, which sometimes became <b>stuck</b> themselves. The tar pits' fossil record is dominated by the remains of predators, such as large canids and felids. Fossils of different animals are found <b>stuck</b> together when they are excavated from the pits. The tar pits do not preserve soft tissue, and a 2014 study concluded that asphalt may degrade the DNA of animals mired in it after an attempt was made to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth.|$|E
5|$|The Chiodo Brothers plan on {{creating}} {{a sequel to}} the film, with the initial release date being scheduled for 2012, though it has since been postponed. The sequel is currently <b>stuck</b> in development hell.|$|E

5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he <b>stuck</b> exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E

5|$|Almost a year later, in August 1981, Voyager 2 {{continued}} {{the study of}} the Saturn system. More close-up images of Saturn's moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings. Unfortunately, during the flyby, the probe's turnable camera platform <b>stuck</b> {{for a couple of days}} and some planned imaging was lost. Saturn's gravity was used to direct the spacecraft's trajectory towards Uranus.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of heavy rainfall in Worcestershire in July 2007 the M5 motorway was blocked, leaving many stranded cars on the road.

Soon, newspapers had dubbed it the “Bloomer dress”, and the name <b>stuck.</b>|$|E
5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road.

5|$|Designed by the {{architectural}} firm of Deeter & Ritchey, the complex {{was completed in}} 1963 and was named for former chancellor Edward Litchfield following his death in an airplane crash in 1968. The complex consists of three towers, which during construction were designated A, B, and C in {{the architectural}} plans. The names <b>stuck</b> after the towers were completed, and the towers are still so named today.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds are {{naturally}} lipophilic and hydrophobic, {{which means the}} diamonds' surface cannot be wet by water, but can be easily wet and <b>stuck</b> by oil. This property can be utilized to extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic diamonds. However, when diamond surfaces are chemically modified with certain ions, {{they are expected to}} become so hydrophilic that they can stabilize multiple layers of water ice at human body temperature.|$|E
