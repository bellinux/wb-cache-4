Based on sensing and predicting the ad-hoc transmission behaviors, the ergodic traffic collision time between the CRN and ad-hoc network is minimized subject to an ergodic uplink throughput requirement for the CRN. We focus on real-time implementation of spectrum sharing policy under practical computation and signaling limitations. In our spectrum sharing policy, most computation tasks are ac-complished off-line. Hence, little real-time calculation is required which fits the requirement of practical applications. Moreover, the <b>signaling</b> <b>procedure</b> and computation process are designed carefully to reduce the time delay between spectrum sensing and data transmission, which is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of traffic prediction and improving the performance of interference mitigation.

However, with massive deployment of small cells, co-channel interference and handover management are two important problems in HCSNet, especially for cell edge users. In this article, we examine the problems of cooperative interference mitigation and handover management in HCSNet. A network architecture is described to combine cloud radio access network with small cells. An effective coordinated multi-point (CoMP) clustering scheme using affinity propagation is adopted to mitigate cell edge users' interference. A low complexity handover management scheme is presented, and its <b>signaling</b> <b>procedure</b> is analyzed in HCSNet.

40|$|Data {{from eight}} {{experiments}} on semantic verification are presented. Two procedures were used, a standard reaction time procedure and a response <b>signal</b> <b>procedure.</b> Data from the response <b>signal</b> <b>procedure</b> showed that for false category-member statements (e. g., all birds are robins), {{there was an}} increasing tendency to respond yes early in processing, replaced later in processing by an increasing tendency to respond no. For statements involving antonym relationships (all mothers are fathers), data from the response <b>signal</b> <b>procedure</b> showed {{that there is no}} greater tendency to respond yes than for anomalous statements (a chair is a wall). Results in the standard reaction time procedure could not be predicted from the results in the response <b>signal</b> <b>procedure.</b> This suggests that simple models of the semantic verification task that assume a single yes/no dimension on which discrimination is made are not correct. Some suggestions are made as to the kinds of properties that would be required for an adequate model. Research in the area of semantic memory has focused on the structure of semantic information and the processes by which subjects verify sentences expressing semantic information. Models of the processes of verification have been developed and the constructs of the models translated into experimental variables that are supposed to affect the time required to verify sentences. These variables have usually involved differences in the information to be processed, such as differences in semantic relatedness or production frequency. For example, in the model of Rips, Shoben, and Smith (1973), the amount of overlap in semantic features between the concepts of a sentence (e. g., between bird and robin in the sentence a robin is a bird) is assumed to affect processing time.

High fan lowered asymptotic accuracy or the rate of rise in accuracy across lags, or both. We developed an Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) model for the response <b>signal</b> <b>procedure</b> to explain these effects. The model assumes that high fan results in weak associative activation that slows memory retrieval, thereby decreasing the probability that retrieval finishes in time and producing a speed–accuracy tradeoff function.

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{empirical}} approximation to the null steady-state {{distribution of the}} cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic, defined as the distribution of values obtained by running a CUSUM with no upper boundary under the null state for an indefinite period of time. The derivation is part theoretical and part empirical and the approximation is valid for CUSUMs applied to Normal data with known variance (although the theoretical result is true in general for exponential family data, which we show in the Ap-pendix). The result leads to an easily-applied formula for steady-state p-values corresponding to CUSUM values, where the steady-state p-value is obtained as the tail area of the null steady-state distribution and represents the expected proportion of time, under repeated application of the CUSUM to null data, that the CUSUM statistic is greater than some particular value. When designing individual charts with fixed boundaries, this measure could be used alongside the average run-length (ARL) value, which we show by way of examples may be approximately related to the steady-state p-value. For multiple CUSUM schemes, use of a p-value enables application of a <b>signalling</b> <b>procedure</b> that adopts a false discovery rate (FDR) approach to multiplicity control. Under this <b>signalling</b> <b>procedure,</b> boundaries on each individual chart change at every observation according to the ordering of CUSUM values across the group of charts.

30|$|Another option {{consists}} of defining a timer inside the MBS client that sends unsolicited IGMP messages towards the ASN-GW. In this second case, the timer for the IGMP query {{sent by the}} ASN-GW could be relaxed or disabled at all, since clients autonomously refresh their status. It is easy {{to show that the}} second solution does not imply additional overhead with respect to the first one, which is analyzed in detail in the article. In this second option, when the ASN-GW receives the IGMP message, and encapsulates it inside the payload of a SIP message towards the MBSC-SS, it includes additional information such as the BS serving the MBS client, which, in turn, has an its own identifier. When this information is received by the MBSC-SS, it checks the data stored in the MBSC-DB to determine if the previous status of the MBS client is changed. This step allows the MBSC-SS to realize if the client has changed the serving BS, and thus to trigger, if necessary, a <b>signaling</b> <b>procedure</b> to update the system by using exactly the same messages already defined (i.e., MBS Context Req and MBS Context Res). Thus, this way of performing session refresh could allow an easy way to maintain active the multicast session in case of client mobility.|$|E

In this paper, we aim {{to address this issue}} by developing DPre, a predictive pre-allocation framework for uplink access scheduling of delay-sensitive applications in industrial process automation. The basic idea of DPre is to explore and exploit the correlation of data acquisition and access behavior between nodes through static and dynamic learning mechanisms in order to make judicious resource per-allocation decisions. We evaluate the effectiveness of DPre based on several monitoring applications in a steel rolling production process. Simulation results demonstrate that DPre achieves better performance in terms of the prediction accuracy, which can effectively increase the rewards of those reserved resources.
