40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} the micro-CT and related software against the section method using the stereomicroscope for marginal leakage assessment along the sealant-enamel interface. METHODS: Pits and fissures of the occlusal surface of 10 teeth were sealed with a resin-fissure sealant material without acid etching, thermocycled for 5000 cycles, immersed in 50 % silver nitrate for three hours and scanned using micro-CT. Teeth were embedded in epoxy resin and cut in three sections. The middle section was subjected to micro-CT and <b>stereomicroscopy.</b> Images were taken from the left and right sides of the sealant-enamel interface at both the left and the right site of the section. Two experienced evaluators assessed marginal leakage. RESULTS: Both assessment instruments observed no leakage in 37 out of the 40 images evaluated. Leakage at the sealant-enamel interface was observed in three <b>stereomicroscopy</b> images only. A fracture line in the sealant was seen on eight <b>stereomicroscopy</b> images and observed in only two micro-CT images.

Sixty-five human permanent molars were selected and one site in each occlusal surface was chosen as the test site. The teeth were cut and prepared according to each technique: <b>stereomicroscopy</b> without coloring (1), dye enhancement with rhodamine B (2) and fuchsine/acetic light green (3), and semi-quantitative microradiography (4). Digital photographs from each prepared tooth were assessed by three examiners for caries extension. Weighted kappa, as well as Friedman's test with multiple comparisons, was performed to compare all techniques and verify statistical significant differences. Results: kappa values varied from 0. 62 to 0. 78, the latter being found by both dye enhancement methods. Friedman's test showed statistical significant difference (P < 0. 001) and multiple comparison identified these differences among all techniques, except between both dye enhancement methods (rhodamine B and fuchsine/acetic light green). Cross-tabulation showed that the <b>stereomicroscopy</b> overscored the lesions. Both dye enhancement methods showed a good agreement, while <b>stereomicroscopy</b> overscored the lesions.

40|$|The {{incidence}} {{and degree of}} patchiness of mucosal abnormality in both coeliac disease (CD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is documented. As judged by both <b>stereomicroscopy</b> and subjective histology, patchiness occurred frequently in both CDand DH patients. In most cases the difference of abnormality was of only one grade, but in approximately 25 % as assessed by <b>stereomicroscopy</b> and 10 % as assessed by histology the difference was {{of two or more}} grades. In control subjects with normal small bowel mucosa the variation of the mucosal appearance between the duodenum and proximal jejunum was studied. Contrary to popular belief, no significant difference of villous and crypt measurements or of apparent villous "bridging" and "branching" between these two sites was found, if only well-orientated sections were studied. The stereomicroscopic appearances were also similar at these two sites, although villi tended to be broader in the duodenal biopsies. The duodenal-jejunal variation was also studied in CD and DH patients and although by both <b>stereomicroscopy</b> and subjective histology the appearances were similar in most patients, in approximately 33 % the duodenal abnormality was the most severe and, surprisingly, the jejunal abnormality was more severe in approximately 15 %.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate <b>stereomicroscopy</b> in parathyroid tissue selection for total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation in secondary (SHPT) /tertiary (THPT) hyperparathyroidism. METHODS: 118 renal patients underwent surgery from April of 2000 to October 2009. They {{were divided into two}} groups: G 1, 66 patients operated from April of 2000 to May of 2005, with tissue selection based on macroscopic observation; G 2, 52 patients operated from March of 2008 to October 2009 with <b>stereomicroscopy</b> for tissue selection searching for the presence of adipose cells. All surgeries were performed by the same surgeon. Patients presented SHPT (dialysis treatment) or THPT (renal-grafted). Follow-up was 12 - 36 months. Intra-operative parathyroid hormone (PTH) was measured in 100 / 118 (84. 7 %) patients. RESULTS: Data are presented as means. G 1 included 66 patients (38 SHPT, 24 females/ 14 males; 40. 0 years of age; 28 THPT, 14 females/ 14 males; 44 years of age). G 2 included 52 patients (29 SHPT, 11 females/ 18 males; 50. 7 years of age; 23 THPT, 13 females/ 10 males, 44. 4 years of age). SHPT patients from G 2 presented preoperative serum calcium higher than those of SHPT patients in G 1 (p < 0. 05), suggesting a more severe disease.

40|$|Histology is {{fundamental}} to assess two-dimensional intestinal inflammation; however, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are often indistinguishable microscopically {{on the basis of}} mucosal biopsies. Here, we use <b>stereomicroscopy</b> (SM) to rapidly profile the entire intestinal topography and assess inflammation. We examine the mucosal surface of 4700 mice (encompassing 416 strains and various IBD-models), create a profiling catalogue of 3 D-stereomicroscopic abnormalities and demonstrate that mice with comparable histological scores display unique sub-clusters of 3 D-structure-patterns of IBD pathology, which we call 3 D-stereoenterotypes, and which are otherwise indiscernible histologically. We show that two ileal IBD-stereoenterotypes (‘cobblestones ’ versus ‘villous mini-aggregation’) cluster separately within two distinct mouse lines of spontaneous ileitis, suggesting that host genetics drive unique and divergent inflammatory 3 D-structural patterns in the gut.

40|$|Dentin {{reactions}} to caries, crucial for pathogenesis {{and for the}} determination of the severity of caries lesions, are believed to be reasonably detected by <b>stereomicroscopy</b> (SM) and polarized light microscopy in quinoline (PLMQ), but accuracies are not available. Here, <b>stereomicroscopy</b> of wet (SW) and dry (SD) ground sections of natural occlusal caries lesions resulted in moderate (0. 7, for normal dentin) and low accuracies (< 0. 6, for carious and sclerotic dentin) as validated by contrast-corrected microradiography. Accuracies of PLMQ were moderate for both normal (0. 71) and carious dentin (0. 71). The hypothesis that detection of dentin reactions by SM and PLMQ would be influenced by the contrast quality of micrographic images was rejected. Dentin reactions were scored by SW, SD, PLMQ, and three types of microradiographic images with varying contrast qualities and each technique was compared against the one that resulted in the highest number of scores for each dentin reaction. Large differences resulted, mainly related to the detection of sclerotic dentin by both SW and SD, and normal and carious dentin by PLMQ. It is concluded that contrast-corrected microradiography should be preferred as the gold standard and SM and PLMQ should be avoided, but the relationship of PLMQ with dentin mineralization deserves further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Witness marks {{produced}} on bone {{by the use}} of saws have traditionally been examined using <b>stereomicroscopy.</b> The marks are typically found on the kerf wall or floor and give important information about the implement that made them. This paper describes a new approach to the analysis of witness marks left on kerf walls and floors from crimes involving dismemberment. Previously, two types of marks have been identified: deep furrows formed during the pull stroke and fine striations formed on the push stroke. These types of striation allow the class of saw to be identified, but not an individual saw. With the advent of environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), insulating materials can now be examined without the need for conductive coatings to be applied. This allows materials to be examined at higher magnifications than those available with <b>stereomicroscopy.</b> Here we report on a new, third type of striation that is visible at higher magnifications on ESEM images. These striations are formed from the imperfections on the cutting teeth of saws and give real possibilities of uniquely identifying whether or not a particular saw was used to cause the mark. In blind trials conducted on sawing of nylon 6. 6, different individual saws could be successfully identified even if different people used the saw. We discuss ways in which these results can be extended to bone and how this may assist in the investigation of the act of dismemberment. 1059...|$|E
40|$|Plant tissue {{colonization}} by Trichoderma atroviride plays {{a critical}} role in the reduction of diseases caused by phytopathogenic fungi, but this process has not been thoroughly studied in situ. We monitored in situ interactions between gfp-tagged biocontrol strains of T. atroviride and soilborne plant pathogens that were grown in cocultures and on cucumber seeds by confocal scanning laser microscopy and fluorescence <b>stereomicroscopy.</b> Spores of T. atroviride adhered to Pythium ultimum mycelia in coculture experiments. In mycoparasitic interactions of T. atroviride with P. ultimum or Rhizoctonia solani, the mycoparasitic hyphae grew alongside the pathogen mycelia, and this was followed by coiling and formation of specialized structures similar to hooks, appressoria, and papillae. The morphological changes observed depended on the pathogen tested. Branching of T. atroviride mycelium appeared to be an active response to the presence of the pathogenic host. Mycoparasitism of P. ultimum by T. atroviride occurred on cucumber seed surfaces while the seeds were germinating. The interaction of these fungi on the cucumber seeds was similar to the interaction observed in coculture experiments. Green fluorescent protein expression under the control of host-inducible promoters was also studied. The induction of specific Trichoderma genes was monitored visually in cocultures, on plant surfaces, and in soil in the presence of colloidal chitin or Rhizoctonia by confocal microscopy and fluorescence <b>stereomicroscopy.</b> These tools allowed initiation of the mycoparasitic gene expression cascade to be monitored in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Background: Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) are {{clusters}} of morphologically altered crypts {{which can be}} observed by light or <b>stereomicroscopy</b> on the mucosal surface of the colon after staining with methylene-blue. They probably represent {{one of the earliest}} events in human colorectal carcinogenesis. The main {{purpose of the present study}} was to observe the surface features of aberrant and normal colonic crypts in humans using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to find and measure differences between aberrant and normal. Materials and Methods: Fifteen mucosal specimens containing ACF and 8 with normal mucosa taken from patients operated on for colon cancer were observed under a scanning electron microscope. Results: By SEM ACF were easily observed on the mucosal surface because they showed a well defined border and were elevated on the mucosal surface. Under higher magnification luminal openings of aberrant crypts had a larger overall average diameter than normal (37. 6 mu m +/- 13. 5, mean a SD, vs 15. 9 mu m +/- 4. 9, P= 0. 001), though when crypt multiplicity of ACF (number of crypts per ACF) was higher, the diameter of luminal openings tended to be smaller and similar to those of normal crypts, with weak negative correlation between crypt multiplicity of ACF and mean diameter of aberrant luminal openings (r=- 0. 27). Finally, the mucosal surface among aberrant crypts was flattened because of a loss of microvilli.

40|$|Background Akt 1 {{is a key}} {{signaling}} molecule {{in multiple}} cell types, including endothelial cells. Accordingly, Akt 1 was proposed as a therapeutic target for ischemic injury {{in the context of}} myocardial infarction (MI). The aim {{of this study was to}} use multimodal in vivo imaging to investigate the impact of systemic Akt 1 deficiency on cardiac function and angiogenesis before and after MI. Methods and Results In vivo cardiac MRI was performed before and at days 1, 8, 15, and 29 to 30 after MI induction for wild-type, heterozygous, and Akt 1 -deficient mice. Noninfarcted hearts were imaged using ex vivo <b>stereomicroscopy</b> and microcomputed tomography. Histological examination was performed for noninfarcted hearts and for hearts at days 8 and 29 to 30 after MI. MRI revealed mildly decreased baseline cardiac function in Akt 1 null mice, whereas ex vivo <b>stereomicroscopy</b> and microcomputed tomography revealed substantially reduced coronary macrovasculature. After MI, Akt 1 (-/-) mice demonstrated significantly attenuated ventricular remodeling and a smaller decrease in ejection fraction. At 8 days after MI, a larger functional capillary network at the remote and border zone, accompanied by reduced scar extension, preserved cardiac function, and enhanced border zone wall thickening, was observed in Akt 1 (-/-) mice when compared with littermate controls. Conclusions Using multimodal imaging to probe the role of Akt 1 in cardiac function and remodeling after MI, this study revealed reduced adverse remodeling in Akt 1 -deficient mice after MI. Augmented myocardial angiogenesis coupled with a more functional myocardial capillary network may facilitate revascularization and therefore be responsible for preservation of infarcted myocardium...|$|E

Our goal was to identify the best target organs and days during pregnancy for further mechanistic studies of the role of fetal cells in maternal disease and injury. C 57 BL/ 6 J wild-type virgin females (n = 54) were mated with congenic enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgenic males. During pregnancy and after delivery, female mice were euthanized, and eight organs and blood were analyzed for the presence of fetal GFP+ cells with flow cytometry and real-time quantitative PCR. Maternal lungs, liver, and spleen were also analyzed by fluorescent <b>stereomicroscopy.</b> Fetal GFP+ cells were first found at low frequency at Embryonic Day 11, increased to a maximum at Embryonic Day 19, and decreased rapidly postpartum. These fetal cell dynamics were significantly reproducible among all mice studied. In addition, there was a consistent distribution of fetal cells within maternal organs, with lung, liver, blood, and spleen having the greatest concentrations; these were highly correlated at all time points (P < 0. 0001). Maternal lung contained 10 - to 100 -fold more fetal cells than any other organ, and using all three techniques, the number of fetal cells detected was the most consistent and reproducible in this organ. <b>Stereomicroscopy</b> showed that within the lung, fetal cells were widely and apparently randomly distributed.

40|$|The surface failure characteristics of different work roll materials, i. e. high speedsteel, high {{chromium}} {{iron and}} indefinite chill iron, used in the finishing stands of a hot stripmill have been investigated using <b>stereomicroscopy,</b> three-dimensional optical profilometry, {{scanning electron microscopy}} and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.  The results show that the surface failure mechanisms of work rolls for hot rolling are very complex, involving plastic deformation, abrasive wear, adhesive wear, mechanical- and thermal-induced cracking, material transfer and oxidation. Despite the differences in chemical composition and microstructure, the tribological response of the different work roll materials was found to be strongly dependent on second phase constituents such as the size, morphology and distribution of different carbide phases and graphite (in the case of indefinite chill iron), which was found to promote cracking. Cracking and chipping of the work roll surfaces, both having a negative impact on work roll wear, are strongly influenced by the presence of carbides, carbide networks and graphite in the work roll surface. Consequently, the amount of carbide-forming elements as well as the manufacturing process must be controlled in order to obtainan optimised microstructure and a predictable wear rate...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Endodontic files come {{in contact}} with blood, {{infected}} pulp tissue, and irrigating solutions during root canal therapy. Some instruments such as <b>stereomicroscopy</b> and scanning electron microscopy are used to observe corrosion of endodontic files which are complicated and dependent on preparation methods. Having knowledge of the corrosion and ion release of endodontic files can help in drawing firm deductions as to which files would perform better in the clinical scenario. Therefore, we have used energy dispersive X-ray analysis and an atomic absorption spectrophotometer to track oxygenon the surface and iron in the exposedmedia to observe the oxidative rate of the media. In this study, corrosion by blood was higher than other biological fluids, but less than wit...|$|E

It {{is available from}} [URL] Doi: 10. 1007 /s 00414 - 006 - 0120 -zWitness marks produced on bone {{by the use of}} saws have traditionally been examined using <b>stereomicroscopy.</b> The marks are typically found on the kerf wall or floor and give important information about the implement that made them. This paper describes a new approach to the analysis of witness marks left on kerf walls and floors from crimes involving dismemberment. Previously, two types of marks have been identified: deep furrows formed during the pull stroke and fine striations formed on the push stroke. These types of striation allow the class of saw to be identified, but not an individual saw. With the advent of environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), insulating materials can now be examined without the need for conductive coatings to be applied. This allows materials to be examined at higher magnifications than those available with <b>stereomicroscopy.</b> Here we report on a new, third type of striation that is visible at higher magnifications on ESEM images. These striations are formed from the imperfections on the cutting teeth of saws and give real possibilities of uniquely identifying whether or not a particular saw was used to cause the mark. In blind trials conducted on sawing of nylon 6. 6, different individual saws could be successfully identified even if different people used the saw. We discuss ways in which these results can be extended to bone and how this may assist in the investigation of the act of dismemberment...|$|E
