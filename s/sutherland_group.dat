40|$|During {{the course}} of the studies {{outlined}} in this thesis, an ether-directed Pd(II) -catalysed aza-Claisen rearrangement reaction that had previously been developed by the <b>Sutherland</b> <b>group</b> was expanded to include more functionalised rearrangement substrates. This methodology has been applied for the synthesis of several natural products including dihydroxylated-amino acids. Further investigation of substrates for the rearrangement led to the synthesis of other substituted trichloroacetimidates. Rearrangement of these compounds demonstrated the role of steric strain on the stereocontrol of the rearrangement and also highlighted the role that solvent can have upon the diastereoselectivity of ether-directed rearrangements. In addition to this, a novel tandem aza-Claisen rearrangement and ring closing metathesis reaction has been developed. This reaction allows the synthesis of cyclic allylic trichloroacetamides in excellent yields from simple allylic alcohols. The use of commercially available chiral rearrangement catalysts allowed a highly enantioselective tandem process to be developed. Further development of this process has provided an ether-directed tandem aza-Claisen rearrangement and RCM reaction which occurs with high yield and diastereoselectivity to provide functionalised cyclic products. The use of these compounds for the total synthesis of the amaryllidaceae alkaloid (+) -gamma-lycorane was also investigated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract During {{the course}} of the studies {{outlined}} in this thesis, a new approach for the synthesis of the tropane alkaloid, (±) -physoperuvine has been developed using a highly efficient one-pot tandem process which involved the Overman rearrangement and a ring closing metathesis reaction. An asymmetric one-pot tandem process has also been employed for the synthesis of the natural product, (+) -physoperuvine. This methodology was also applied to the generation of a late-stage intermediate {{that could be used in}} the synthesis of carbocyclic nucleosides, such as noraristeromycin. In the second part of this thesis, an ether-directed Pd(II) -catalysed Overman rearrangement which had previously been developed by the <b>Sutherland</b> <b>group</b> was applied in conjunction with a cross-metathesis reaction for the stereoselective synthesis of the guanidine alkaloid, (+) -monanchorin in a fourteen-step synthesis. Further employment of this process provided the first synthesis of clavaminol A, C and H from (R) -glycidol in a rapid and efficient manner. In a similar fashion, (2 S, 3 R) -enantiomers were also synthesised from (S) -glycidol. In addition to this, using similar chemistry, an intermediate protected enone was prepared using a cross-metathesis reaction as the second key step in an approach towards the synthesis of an NO-inhibitor. ...|$|E
40|$|The first {{research}} project {{described in this}} thesis {{is the development of}} new SPECT and PET imaging agents for group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR 2 / 3). Investigation of these receptors is of great interest as they have been implicated in many psychiatric disorders. A small library of 1, 5 -benzodiazepinones were synthesised with potential radiolabelling sites incorporated in the 7 - and 8 -positions around the benzodiazepinone core. Once synthesised the binding affinity of the compounds with mGluR 2 was determined using the [35 S]GTPγS binding assay, which revealed them to be highly potent. Physicochemical properties were also investigated to determine whether compounds were likely to be brain penetrant. The 8 -trifluoromethyl- 7 -methoxy and 8 -iodo substituted compounds were found to have the required properties to be progressed. Work then focused on the synthesis of radiolabelling precursors of the hit compounds. The second {{research project}} outlined in thesis involves the synthesis of novel heterocycle containing α-amino acids. Previous work in the <b>Sutherland</b> <b>group</b> achieved the synthesis of enone containing amino acids from L-aspartic acid.

40|$|The <b>Sutherland</b> <b>group</b> {{recently}} {{demonstrated the}} prebiotic synthesis of activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides as their 2 ', 3 '-cyclic phosphates, and these species are candidates for oligomerisation to RNA. These species hydrolyse to the corresponding 2 '- and 3 '-monophosphates {{and there is}} a need to discover prebiotically plausible ways to re-activate to the cyclic material. Previous methods have suffered from poor yields and/or derivatization of the nucleobase. This study describes a new multicomponent reaction that achieves highly efficient nucleotide activation and at the same time produces amino acid derivatives, also of importance in the origin of life. This reactivity is then further developed and utilised in the prebiotic synthesis of derivatives of glyceric acid 2 - and 3 -phosphate, used in the glycolysis pathway in contemporary biochemistry. Aminoacyl-RNA trimers are central to the RNA:coded peptides theory by Sutherland, whereby RNA replication and coded peptide synthesis are proposed to have emerged together in the origin of life. The aminoacylation of an RNA trimer is therefore investigated, again using a multicomponent reaction. With the prebiotic synthesis and re-activation of nucleoside- 2 ', 3 '-cyclic phosphates shown, the oligomerisation of these species is now a major goal. The dry-state oligomerisation of these species using ethanolamine as catalyst is discussed. Key ethanolamine-adduct intermediates are identified, and the preference for the formation of natural [3 '- 5 '] linkages produced by this type of oligomerisation is rationalised. The compartmentalisation of a primitive replicating genetic system is considered an important stage in the origin of life in order to overcome the high dilution of the oceans. Previous studies have focussed on long chain carboxylic acids for this purpose but these are unstable to the conditions required for RNA folding and catalysis, and only form bilayer vesicles at a specific pH. The final chapter investigates the prebiotic synthesis of a simple phospholipid amphiphile that has the potential to form more suitable lipid vesicles.

40|$|The Sutherland Formula {{is widely}} used in the United Kingdom to {{determine}} protein and energy requirements of burned children. Achieving the target of this formula can be difficult {{because of the high}} levels of protein and energy intake that are inherent in the Sutherland formula calculation. An alternative formula was devised using new parameters, i. e., normal daily nitrogen requirements, wound nitrogen losses and urinary nitrogen losses, which may more closely match the requirements of children with burns. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the new formula and to reappraise the Sutherland Formula using current liquid enteral feeds and feeding methods. The study was randomly controlled in design, the <b>Sutherland</b> Fed (SF) <b>Group</b> received enteral feeds according to the Sutherland Formula and East Grinstead Formula (EGF) Group received enteral feeds according to the new East Grinstead Formula. Subjects entered the study on day zero of burn injury. Burn size, using the method of Lund and Browder, was used, to indicate the percentage of body surface area burned. All nutritional intakes were recorded, nutritional parameters, clinical assessments, wound status, medication, body weight changes, serum and urine analysis were assessed. Nine subjects were recruited into the <b>Sutherland</b> Formula <b>Group,</b> mean age 3 years, (range 1 - 5 years) mean burn size 19 % Body Surface Area (BSA), range 10 - 40 %. Eight subjects were recruited into East Grinstead fed Group, mean age 4 years, range 1 - 13 years mean burn size 15 % BSA, range 10 - 30 %. The <b>Sutherland</b> Formula <b>Group</b> achieved 80 % of energy targets and 85 % of protein targets. The East Grinstead Group achieved 95 % of energy targets and 90 % of protein targets. Total serum protein and albumin remained within the normal ranges for both groups. Serum Retinol binding protein and thyroxine binding protein showed an upward trend for both groups. Serum IGF- 1 and growth hormone remained within the normal range for both groups. A larger number of patients in <b>Sutherland</b> Formula <b>Group</b> required antibiotics than in East Grinstead Formula <b>Group.</b> The <b>Sutherland</b> Formula <b>Group</b> had a negligible weight change - 1. 3 %, whilst the East Grinstead Formula group had a weight gain + 2. 4 %. An intake of 3 g/kg/day protein is adequate to meet the requirements of young burned children, as was supplied by the EGF formula. A target protein intake at 4 g/kg/day as provided by the Sutherland Formula is probably too high and did not appear necessary in the group of children studied. Children can be successfully and comfortably sustained on enteral feeding for 1 - 3 week periods and this mode of feeding can be instigated within hours of injury. Enteral feeding may be the only way to achieve EGF targets due to the rigorous demands of the surgical and clinical management procedures endured by these patients. From this work the researcher concluded that the East Grinstead Formula is appropriate for feeding children with burn trauma from a clinical and practical point of view. This study supports the findings of other studies in burned adults in that early enteral feeding of burned children is beneficial in promoting good nutritional status. In addition the low volume, isotonic, high protein enteral feed, with a protein energy ratio of 2 0 %, used in this study, was tolerated by the children studied. Simplification of the East Grinstead Formula for burned children is: Protein 3 g/kg BW/day with a protein energy ratio of 17 - 20 %...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Sutherland</b> <b>group</b> {{recently}} {{demonstrated that}} from a mixture of oligoribonucleotide- 2 '- or 3 '-phosphates the latter is chemoselectively acetylated. This is shown to mediate a template-directed ligation to give predominantly 3 ', 5 '-linked RNA that is acetylated at the ligation junction (acetyl-RNA). It was suggested that RNA emerged prebiotically via acetyl-RNA and also is proposed to have favourable genotypic properties due to greater propensity to form duplex structure. To study the properties of acetyl-RNA, their synthesis by solid-phase chemistry was required and described is {{the design of a}} 2 '/ 3 '-O-acetyl orthogonal protecting group strategy. Key to the orthogonal protecting group strategy is the use of (2 -cyanoethoxy) carbonyl {{for the protection of the}} nucleobase exocyclic amines and a photolabile solid-phase linker group that allowed partial on-column deprotection. The synthesis of the 2 '/ 3 '-O-acetyl and 2 '/ 3 '-O-TBDMS phosphoramidites, in addition to preparation of a photolabile solid-phase support, are described. With the materials to hand the procedures for an automated synthesis of acetyl-RNA were optimised and several acetyl-RNA oligonucleotides were synthesised. The duplex stability of acetyl-RNA with up to four sites of 2 '-O-acetylation were assessed by UV melting curve analysis. Remarkably, the acetyl groups caused a consistent decrease in Tm of between 3. 0 - 3. 2 °C. Thermodynamic parameters indicated a decrease in duplex stability that was consistent with a decrease in hydration of the minor groove resulting in a reduction of the stabilising hydrogen bonding network. The stability of a tetraloop was also found to decrease on acetylation. The acetylated- tetraloop it is able to form duplex at lower concentrations than the natural tetraloop. Additionally, it is more stable at high concentrations, indicating that acetyl-RNA favours duplex over other secondary structure. These properties are considered to give acetyl-RNA competitive advantage for their non-enzymatic replication. Aminoacylation of RNA is an important process in modern biology but the intermediacy of aminoacyl-adenylates is considered to be prebiotically implausible. A potentially prebiotic aminoacylation of nucleoside- 3 '-phosphates, selective for the 2 '-hydroxyl, is presented. However, it was thought the aminoacylation yields could be improved and so a search for an alternative activator was conducted. Oligoribonucleotide- 3 '-phosphates were exposed to the aminoacylation conditions and selective aminoacylation at only the 2 '-hydroxyl of the 3 '-end was observed. In particular, the aminoacylation of a trimer lends support to Sutherland’s theory of a linked origin of RNA and coded peptide synthesis...|$|E

40|$|Anthelmintics are {{typically}} {{used to control}} worms and combat their deleterious effects on productivity, but inappropriate use has resulted in widespread resistance of worms to available anthelmintic treatment <b>groups</b> (<b>Sutherland</b> and Scott 2010). Adoption of new management strategies is required to slow the development of anthelmintic resistance.

The most appropriate indicator for selecting sheep that are to remain untreated is not clear. It is widely believed that sheep with a high body condition score (BCS) are better able to cope with worms (i. e., they have higher worm resilience) than sheep with low BCS, but little field research has been undertaken to verify this.

40|$|The Stratigraphy Committee of the British Geological Survey (BGS) is {{undertaking}} {{a review}} of stratigraphical classification for all parts of Great Britain. Several Stratigraphical Framework Committees (SFC) have been established to review problematical issues for {{various parts of the}} stratigraphical column. Each SFC has the following terms of reference: • To review the lithostratigraphical nomenclature of designated stratigraphical intervals for a given region, identifying problems in classification and correlation. • To propose a lithostratigraphical framework down to formation level that {{can be used as a}} central reference by geologists working in the region concerned. • To organise peer review of the scheme. • To present the results in a document suitable for publication. • To ensure that full definitions of the lithostratigraphical units are held in the web-accessible BGS Lexicon of Named Rock Units for the areas of responsibility covered by the SFC. The process of erecting a framework requires decisions to be taken about correlations and equivalences leading to a simplified nomenclature. Inevitably, many names will be rendered obsolete. The frameworks are lithostratigraphical and though each is set against a chronostratigraphical reference column, the finer points of the chronostratigraphy of the succession are not the prime concern. The predominantly Middle Jurassic rocks discussed in this report have been considered by the Jurassic Stratigraphical Framework Committee under the leadership initially of M G Sumbler (who compiled an initial draft in 2003) and, after 2001, A J M Barron. The report introduces a lithostratigraphical framework to formation level for the Middle Jurassic succession of Britain and adjoining offshore areas. It applies to the main outcrops and subcrops (where the strata are present at depth), and the offshore occurrences. It follows on, with an extended geographical brief, from the stratigraphical framework report for the Lower Jurassic of England and Wales (Cox et al., 1999). The onshore distribution has been divided into six depositional areas; the Wessex–Weald Basin, the Cotswolds, the East Midlands Shelf, the Cleveland Basin, the Moray Firth and the Hebrides, although for practical reasons the essentially arbitrary lateral limits of the first three may differ for various stratigraphical levels. The economic importance and availability of natural and man-made exposures of Middle Jurassic strata has resulted in well over 200 years of research attempting to classify them. Much of this work occurred long before guidance was available for best practice in naming lithostratigraphical units, and there has been a haphazard approach to the establishment of the hierarchy of units. From an early, relatively simple framework, subsequent publications have greatly added to the complexity of the nomenclature. Often this reflected the localised nature of research with different names being applied to essentially the same unit in different areas. Also, previously laterally contiguous deposits have been separated, eroded or concealed by post-Jurassic tectonic, igneous or sedimentary events and processes. Chapter 1 of this report is an introduction to the Middle Jurassic Series and the included proposals. It indicates the principles for the development of the new lithostratigraphical scheme and sets out the key publications used for reference. Chapter 2 summarises the structural and palaeogeographical setting of Great Britain through the Middle Jurassic and sets out the definitions, history and development of the basins. Chapter 3 briefly describes the key techniques (principally biostratigraphy) for correlation of successions, and sets out the basis for the establishment of the chronostratigraphical framework. Chapter 4 outlines the development of the lithostratigraphical framework. The fifth (Chapters 5 to 8) and largest part of the report provides a fuller description of the stratigraphical framework for each of the six onshore groups – the Inferior Oolite, Great Oolite, Ravenscar and Ancholme groups in England, and the Great Estuarine and <b>Sutherland</b> <b>groups</b> in Scotland, subdivided as appropriate into regions and/or palaeogeographical provinces. Each entry includes a description of the origin and history of the nomenclature, rank and subdivisions, principal lithologies, type area and reference sections, geographical extent, lower and upper boundary, thickness, age range, environment of deposition and key references.

40|$|Simultaneous {{grouping}} {{by common}} onset time {{is believed to}} be a powerful cue in auditory perception; components that start or stop roughly at the same time are judged as far more likely to have originated from the same source. Here we report a simple experiment designed to simulate a complex psychophysical paradigm first described by Darwin and <b>Sutherland</b> [(1984) <b>Grouping</b> frequency components of vowels. When is a harmonic not a harmonic? Quarterly J of Experimental Psychology: Hum Exp Psychol 36 (A) : 193 – 208]. It is possible to change the perception of the vowel /I/ to /?/ by manipulating the harmonics around the first formant (F 1). Increasing the amplitude of one harmonic around F 1 caused the perception of the vowel to change from /I/ to /?/. Extending the increased component before the vowel could, however, greatly reduce this change. The role of neural adaptation in this effect was questioned by repeating the experiment but this time using a ‘captor’ tone which was switched on with the asynchronous harmonic and off when the vowel started. This time the vowel percept did change in a fashion analogous to the effect of an increase in the amplitude of the fourth harmonic (which is close to F 1). This effect was explained by assuming that the captor had grouped with the leading portion of the asynchronous component enabling the remainder of the asynchronous component to be grouped with the remainder of the components. We propose a relatively low-level neuronal explanation for this grouping effect: the captor reduces the neural response to the leading segment of the asynchronous component by activating across-frequency suppression, either from the cochlea, or acting via a wideband inhibitor in the ventral cochlear nucleus. The reduction in neural response results in a release from adaptation with the offset of the captor terminating the inhibition, such that the response to the continuation of that component is now enhanced. Using a simplified paradigm we show that both primary-like and chopper units in the ventral cochlear nucleus of the anesthetized guinea pig may show a rebound in excitation when a captor is positioned so as to stimulate the suppressive sidebands in its receptive field. The strength of the rebound was positively correlated with the strength of the suppression. These and other results are consistent with the view that low-level mechanisms underlie the psychophysical captor effect. <br/...|$|R
