40|$|The report {{presents}} {{the use of}} Bayesian networks in the calculation of symbolic indicators of reliability and unreliability of the electric power supplying load point. The calculation of indicators of reliability {{is determined by the}} analytical dependencies. These dependencies are used to estimate: probability of up or down state of power system components supplying the load point; total probability distribution; conditional probabilities of the state power or lack of power appearance; the intensity of current interruptions and the average time of their duration; contributions of individual power system components in the service reliability. This report describes how to obtain these analytical dependencies, using the ultimate application for symbolic computations Mathematica (ver. 8). In this paper we will discuss the results of the symbolic computations for selected <b>supply</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> and methods for reducing the duration of symbolic computations of indicators for multiple-compound electrical power systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Maximum power {{transfer}} and optimal reactive power at voltage stability limit {{is the major}} problem. In power system, engineers faced with problem of variable load ranging from minimum to maximum at or near a constant value of voltage. A power system must be planned and operated {{in such a manner}} so as it gives good quality of reliable <b>supply.</b> <b>Power</b> <b>system</b> must be planned, designed installed and operated in such a manner so as to avoid voltage instability and voltage collapse. When the inductive load is increased the reactive power absorption is increased and hence voltage drop in transmission lines is increased and receiving end voltage is decreased. Voltage drop in transmission line depends upon the reactive power. Power transfer and receiving end voltage can be enhanced by using shunt compensation in order to increase the load. This paper looks in to a power flow program in MATLAB environment. Thus it is a graphical method to find out the magnitude of {{power transfer}} and receiving end voltage at steady state voltage stability limit and optimum value of power transfer and receiving voltage when the system is at stable state...|$|E
40|$|In an {{operating}} theatre, electro medical equipment (EME) may fail and cause health hazards as the pass-ing of a weak but hazardous current (leakage current) {{through the heart}} of the patient during surgical interventions. This occurs evidently during their use, when connected to the patient. The related values of leakage currents can be estimated by an electrical circuit model. To obtain the circuit of a surgical layout, the electrical models of medical location <b>supply</b> <b>power</b> <b>system,</b> human body and EME involved in a determined surgical intervention ought to be drawn. The present work focuses on the method to obtain the model of EME. The idea is to model by circuits each leakage current measurement set-up performed in accordance with the international standard IEC 60601 - 1. To assign the values to the model parameters, it is necessary to obtain also some information on the EME as the values of insula-tion impedances and the feasible leakage current paths inside it. The case of a commercial defibrillator is taken as an example to show the feasibility of the method. The comparison between the leakage currents simulated by the circuit and the ones measured is here presented. The agreement is satisfac-tory. An estimation of the model sensitivity due to the uncertainty in the knowledge of the parameters has been performed too, by using the Monte Carlo method. The extension of this approach to draw the model of other EME is also considered in view of the realization of a surgical layout circuit...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The {{main idea}} of the paper is {{investigation}} of the maximum values of current and angle errors of the current transformers {{and the nature of}} their changes in steady-state and transient power system conditions in which the possible output of errors beyond the normalized range of values, as well as a comparison of the degree of change of current and angle errors of the current transformers for power supply auxiliary wiring devices of relaying protection in these conditions. Research methods. The authors used the method of simulation and visualization of the current transformer operation of computers, intended for supply of secondary circuits of relay protection devices in steady and transient conditions of <b>supply</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> and different operating modes. The obtained results. The authors defined the percentage of the maximum current and angular error of the primary current transformation to the secondary circuit of the current transformer which are caused by the presence of the magnetizing current and resistive losses in the magnetic system of the test current transformer; their comparison is performed and conclusions are drawn regarding their changes in steady-state and transient conditions, in particular, the fact is established that the current errors in emergency conditions vary to a much greater extent than the angular and under certain conditions may extend beyond the value of the normalized state standards. Scientific novelty. The authors developed the modern method of investigation of current and angle errors of the current transformers for auxiliary supply of relay protection devices based on the use of a computer model of an ideal current transformer with a linear no hysteresis B-H curve, which has similar characteristics and primary and secondary circuit parameters to study the real transformer current. Practical significance. The results can be used in researching the optimum operating current transformers conditions and the development of new principles of perform measurement and logical circuits of relaying protection, in particular, it was concluded that in order to provide the more sensitive and selective protection we can use the devices based on the principle of their action to respond only to the phase relation between the currents of the current transformers and connections that have to be rebuilt only from the angle measurement errors...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{motivated}} by the fundamental match between hotel space conditioning load response capability and power system contingency response needs. As power system costs rise and capacity is strained demand response can provide a significant system reliability benefit at a potentially attractive cost. At ORNL s suggestion, Digital Solutions Inc. adapted its hotel air conditioning control technology to <b>supply</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> spinning reserve. This energy saving technology is primarily designed to provide the hotel operator {{with the ability to}} control individual room temperature set-points based upon occupancy (25 % to 50 % energy savings based on an earlier study [Kirby and Ally, 2002]). DSI added instantaneous local load shedding capability in response to power system frequency and centrally dispatched load shedding capability in response to power system operator command. The 162 room Music Road Hotel in Pigeon Forge Tennessee agreed to host the spinning reserve test. The Tennessee Valley Authority supplied real-time metering equipment {{in the form of an}} internet connected Dranetz-BMI power quality meter and monitoring expertise to record total hotel load during both normal operations and test results. The Sevier County Electric System installed the metering. Preliminary testing showed that hotel load can be curtailed by 22 % to 37 % depending on the outdoor temperature and the time of day. These results are prior to implementing control over the common area air conditioning loads. Testing was also not at times of highest system or hotel loading. Full response occurred in 12 to 60 seconds from when the system operator s command to shed load was issued. The load drop was very rapid, essentially as fast as the 2 second metering could detect, with all units responding essentially simultaneously. Load restoration was ramped back in over several minutes. The restoration ramp can be adjusted to the power system needs. Frequency response testing was not completed. Initial testing showed that the units respond very quickly. Problems with local power quality generated false low frequency signals which required testing to be stopped. This should not be a problem in actual operation since the frequency trip points will be staggered to generate a droop curve which mimics generator governor response. The actual trip frequencies will also be low enough to avoid power quality problems. The actual trip frequencies are too low to generate test events with sufficient regularity to complete testing in a reasonable amount of time. Frequency response testing will resume once the local power quality problem is fully understood and reasonable test frequency settings can be determined. Overall the preliminary testing was extremely successful. The hotel response capability matches the power system reliability need, being faster than generation response and inherently available when the power system is under the most stress (times of high system and hotel load). Periodic testing is scheduled throughout the winter and spring to characterize hotel response capability under a full range of conditions. More extensive testing will resume when summer outdoor temperatures are again high enough to fully test hotel response...|$|E
