5|$|<b>Stainless</b> <b>steels</b> {{contain a}} minimum of 11% chromium, often {{combined}} with nickel, to resist corrosion. Some <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> such as the ferritic <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> are magnetic, while others, such as the austenitic, are nonmagnetic.

5|$|Molybdenum is also {{valued in}} steel alloys for its high {{corrosion}} resistance and weldability. Molybdenum contributes corrosion resistance to type-300 <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> (specifically type-316) and especially {{so in the}} so-called superaustenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> (such as alloy AL-6XN, 254SMO or 1925hMo). Molybdenum increases lattice strain, thus increasing the energy required to dissolve iron atoms from the surface. Molybdenum {{is also used to}} enhance the corrosion resistance of ferritic (for example grade 444) and martensitic (for example 1.4122 and 1.4418) <b>stainless</b> <b>steels.</b>|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{frictional}} resistance of titanium, self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> and conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets, using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and titanium molybdenum alloy (TMA) archwires. Materials and Methods: We compared the frictional resistance in 0. 018 slot and 0. 022 slot of the three brackets - titanium, self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> and conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> - using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> archwires and TMA archwires. An in vitro study of simulated canine retraction was undertaken to evaluate the difference in frictional resistance between titanium, self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> and <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets, using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and TMA archwires. Results and Conclusion: We compared the frictional resistance of titanium, self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> and conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets, using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and TMA archwires, with the help of Instron Universal Testing Machine. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Student′s "t" test, and post hoc multiple range test at level of < 0. 05 showed statistically significant difference in the mean values of all groups. Results demonstrated that the titanium, self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> and <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets of 0. 018 -inch and 0. 022 -inch slot had no significant variations in frictional résistance. The self-ligating bracket with TMA archwires showed relatively less frictional resistance compared with the other groups.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the quantitative effects on torque expression of varying the slot size of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> orthodontic brackets and {{the dimension of}} <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire, and to analyze {{the limitations of the}} experimental methods used. Materials and Methods: In vitro studies measuring torque expression in conventional and self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets with a torque-measuring device, with the use of straight <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> orthodontic wire without second-order mechanics and without loops, coils, or auxiliary wires, were sought through a systematic review process. Results: Eleven articles were selected. Direct comparison of different studies was limited by differences in the measuring devices used and in the parameters measured. On the basis of the selected studies, in a 0. 018 inch <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> bracket slot, the engagement angle ranges from 31 degrees with a 0. 016 0. 016 inch <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> archwire to 4. 6 degrees with a 0. 018 0. 025 inch <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> archwire.

5|$|Manganese is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Mn and atomic number 25. It is not found {{as a free}} element in nature; it is often found in minerals in combination with iron. Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal alloy uses, particularly in <b>stainless</b> <b>steels.</b>|$|E
5|$|Niobium is an {{effective}} microalloying element for steel, within which it forms niobium carbide and niobium nitride. These compounds improve the grain refining, and retard recrystallization and precipitation hardening. These effects in turn increase the toughness, strength, formability, and weldability.

5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
5|$|The heavier {{metalloids}} {{continue the}} theme. Arsenic can form alloys with metals, including platinum and copper; {{it is also}} added to copper and its alloys to improve corrosion resistance and appears to confer the same benefit when added to magnesium. Antimony is well known as an alloy-former, including with the coinage metals. Its alloys include pewter (a tin alloy with up to 20% antimony) and type metal (a lead alloy with up to 25% antimony). Tellurium readily alloys with iron, as ferrotellurium (50–58% tellurium), and with copper, {{in the form of}} copper tellurium (40–50% tellurium). Ferrotellurium is used as a stabilizer for carbon in steel casting. Of the non-metallic elements less often recognised as metalloids, selenium—in the form of ferroselenium (50–58% selenium)—is used to improve the machinability of <b>stainless</b> <b>steels.</b>|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{consists of}} the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape. Moulds can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made from tool steels, but <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high volume production or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior mechanical properties and {{are more prone to}} wear, damage, and deformation during the injection and clamping cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced. Many steel moulds are designed to process well over a million parts during their lifetime and can cost {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to fabricate.|$|E
50|$|Some 3D {{printing}} providers {{have developed}} proprietary <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> sintering blends {{for use in}} rapid prototyping. One {{of the more popular}} <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> grades used in 3D printing is 316L <b>stainless</b> <b>steel.</b> Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> products manufactured via 3D printing tend to have a more refined microstructure; this in turn results in better mechanical properties. However, <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> is not used as much as materials like Ti6Al4V in the 3D printing industry; this is because manufacturing <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> products via traditional methods is currently much more economically competitive.|$|R

25|$|Salt water causes {{corrosion}} {{in metal}} parts. It {{can be difficult}} to maintain tidal stream generators due to their size and depth in the water. The use of corrosion-resistant materials such as <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> high-nickel alloys, copper-nickel alloys, nickel-copper alloys and titanium can greatly reduce, or eliminate, corrosion damage.|$|E
25|$|In the mid 1990s two duplex (ferritic-austenitic) <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> were {{introduced}} (DP28W, jointly developed by Toyo Engineering and Sumitomo Metals Industries and Safurex, jointly developed by Stamicarbon and Sandvik Materials Technology (Sweden).) These let manufactures drastically {{reduce the amount}} of passivation oxygen. In theory, they could operate with no oxygen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stainless</b> <b>steels</b> have poor {{machinability}} {{compared to}} regular carbon steel {{because they are}} tougher, gummier and tend to work harden very rapidly. Slightly hardening the steel may decrease its gumminess and {{make it easier to}} cut. AISI grades 303 and 416 are easier to machine because of the addition of sulphur and phosphorus.|$|E

25|$|Filler metal (electrode material) {{improperly}} {{chosen for}} the environmental conditions can make them corrosion-sensitive as well. There are also issues of galvanic corrosion if the electrode composition is sufficiently dissimilar to the materials welded, or the materials are dissimilar themselves. Even between different grades of nickel-based <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> corrosion of welded joints can be severe, despite that they rarely undergo galvanic corrosion when mechanically joined.|$|E
25|$|The {{products}} of high-temperature corrosion can potentially be {{turned to the}} advantage of the engineer. The formation of oxides on <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> for example, can provide a protective layer preventing further atmospheric attack, allowing for a material to be used for sustained periods at both room and high temperatures in hostile conditions. Such high-temperature corrosion products, in the form of compacted oxide layer glazes, prevent or reduce wear during high-temperature sliding contact of metallic (or metallic and ceramic) surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{is one of}} {{the most}} noble metals. It will not be harmed by contact with other metals but it will cause {{corrosion}} to some other metals if contacted directly. The principal metals of concern regarding direct contact with copper are aluminum, light-gauge steel, and zinc. Aluminum and steel flashings and galvanized steel fasteners should not be used with copper. Runoff from a copper roof corrodes aluminum and steel guttering. It is not necessary to isolate copper from lead, tin or many <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> under most circumstances.|$|E

25|$|Oxy-acetylene can cut only low- to medium-carbon steels and wrought iron. High-carbon steels are {{difficult}} to cut because the melting point of the slag {{is closer to the}} melting point of the parent metal, so that the slag from the cutting action does not eject as sparks but rather mixes with the clean melt near the cut. This keeps the oxygen from reaching the clean metal and burning it. In the case of cast iron, graphite between the grains and the shape of the grains themselves interfere with the cutting action of the torch. <b>Stainless</b> <b>steels</b> cannot be cut either because the material does not burn readily.|$|E
25|$|Passivation {{refers to}} the {{spontaneous}} formation of an ultrathin film of corrosion products, known as a passive film, on the metal's surface that act {{as a barrier to}} further oxidation. The chemical composition and microstructure of a passive film are different from the underlying metal. Typical passive film thickness on aluminium, <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> and alloys is within 10 nanometers. The passive film is different from oxide layers that are formed upon heating and are in the micrometer thickness range – the passive film recovers if removed or damaged whereas the oxide layer does not. Passivation in natural environments such as air, water and soil at moderate pH is seen in such materials as aluminium, stainless steel, titanium, and silicon.|$|E
500|$|For GTAW {{of carbon}} and <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> the {{selection}} of a filler material is important to prevent excessive porosity. Oxides on the filler material and workpieces must be removed before welding to prevent contamination, and immediately prior to welding, alcohol or acetone should be used to clean the surface. Preheating is generally not necessary for mild steels less than one inch thick, but low alloy steels may require preheating to slow the cooling process and prevent the formation of martensite in the heat-affected zone. [...] Tool steels should also be preheated to prevent cracking in the heat-affected zone. Austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> do not require preheating, but martensitic and ferritic chromium <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> do. A DCEN power source is normally used, and thoriated electrodes, tapered to a sharp point, are recommended. Pure argon is used for thin workpieces, but helium can be introduced as thickness increases.|$|E
