5|$|On 13 April 1923, {{during a}} {{procession}} by local Congress volunteers in Nagpur commemorating the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the Swaraj flag with the spinning wheel, designed by Pingali Venkayya, was hoisted. This event {{resulted in a}} confrontation between the Congressmen and the police, after which five people were imprisoned. Over a hundred other protesters continued the flag procession after a meeting. Subsequently, {{on the first of}} May, Jamnalal Bajaj, the secretary of the Nagpur Congress Committee, started the Flag Satyagraha, gaining national attention and marking a <b>significant</b> <b>point</b> in the flag movement. The satyagraha, promoted nationally by the Congress, started creating cracks within the organisation in which the Gandhians were highly enthused while the other group, the Swarajists, called it inconsequential.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November, Vale conceded {{twice in}} one game {{for the first time}} in the season, as Peel Park saw their Accrington Stanley side achieve a 2–2 draw with the Vale. Vale lost a two-goal lead in the match, as Ian Brydon scored after the ball got stuck in the mud and then Les Cocker scored the {{equalising}} goal after Ray King failed to hold on to a shot. By this time Vale were building a <b>significant</b> <b>point</b> advantage over the rest of the league. On 28 November, Ken Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Vale 'tore apart' a poor Rochdale side 6–0, exceeding the record Vale Park win that had been set only two months earlier.|$|E

5|$|Early historians, {{including}} the 6th century cleric Gildas, have noted 383 as a <b>significant</b> <b>point</b> in Welsh history, {{as it is}} stated in literature as the foundation point of several medieval royal dynasties. In that year the Roman general Magnus Maximus, or Macsen Wledig, stripped all of western and northern Britain of troops and senior administrators, to launch a successful bid for imperial power; continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor. Gildas, writing in about 540, says that Maximus departed Britain, taking with him all of its Roman troops, armed bands, governors and the flower of its youth, never to return. Having left with the troops and Roman administrators, and planning to continue as the ruler of Britain in the future, his practical course was to transfer local authority to local rulers. The earliest Welsh genealogies give Maximus the role of founding father for several royal dynasties, including those of Powys and Gwent. It was this transfer of power that {{has given rise to}} the belief that he was the father of the Welsh Nation. He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg, erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales.|$|E

25|$|DRDO cooperates {{with the}} state owned Ordnance Factories Board for {{producing}} its items. These have led to issues of marginal quality control for some items, and time consuming rectification. Whilst these are common {{to the introduction of}} most new weapons systems, the OFB has had issues with maintaining the requisite schedule and quality of manufacture owing to their own structural problems and lack of modernization. The DRDO has played a vital {{role in the development of}} this ability since the role of private organizations in the development of small arms and similar items has been limited. A <b>significant</b> <b>point</b> in case is the INSAS rifle which has been adopted by the Indian Army as its standard battle rifle and is in extensive service. There have been issues with rifle quality in usage under extreme conditions in the heat, with the OFB stating that it will rectify these troubles with higher grade material and strengthening the unit. Prior troubles were also dealt with in a similar manner. In the meantime, the rifle has found favour throughout the army and has been ordered in number by other paramilitary units and police forces.|$|E

In the former, the 2 D coordinates of the <b>significant</b> <b>points</b> are located by applying the heuristically extraction method to the human silhouette and the contour analysis of the human silhouette. In the latter, the input feature vector of the ANN is composed with the result of analyzing a human silhouette image and the output vector of the ANN indicates the 2 D coordinates of the <b>significant</b> <b>points.</b> In both methods, the estimated results are optimized and tracked by using Kalman filter. Experimental results show both the feasibility and the characteristics of the presented methods for estimating human body postures...|$|R

As the line was cheaply built and ungraded and the locomotives were of poor quality, services were very slow, initially taking 1hour 45minutes to traverse the six miles (10km) from Brill to the junction station with main line services at Quainton Road. Although serving a lightly populated area and little-used by passengers, the station was a <b>significant</b> <b>point</b> for freight traffic, particularly as a carrier of milk from the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire to Aylesbury and London. A brickworks was also attached to the station, but it proved unable to compete with nearby rivals and closed within a few years of opening.|$|E
500|$|Lat's formal {{education}} began {{at a local}} Malay kampung(village) school; these institutions often taught in the vernacular and did not aspire to academic attainment. [...] The boy changed schools several times; {{the nature of his}} father's job moved the family from one military base to another across the country, until they settled back at his birthplace in 1960. [...] A year later, Lat passed the Special Malay Class Examination, qualifying him to attend an English medium boarding school—National Type Primary School—in the state's capital, Ipoh. [...] His achievement helped his father make the decision to sell their kampung estate and move the family to the town; society in those days considered education at an English medium school a springboard to a good future. [...] Lat continued his education at Anderson School, Perak's [...] "premier non-missionary English medium school".

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} recognizing human actions in a multi-camera setup. The proposed method automatically extracts <b>significant</b> <b>points</b> on the human body, without the need of artificial markers. A sophisticated appearance-based tracking {{able to cope with}} occlusions is exploited to extract a probability map for each moving object. A segmentation technique based on mixture of Gaussians is then employed to extract and track <b>significant</b> <b>points</b> on this map, corresponding to significant regions on the human silhouette. The point tracking produces a set of 3 D trajectories that are compared with other trajectories by means of global alignment and dynamic programming techniques. Preliminary experiments showed the potentiality of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|A new {{interfacing}} {{method is}} presented to control mobile robot(s) in a supervised manner. Mobile robots often provide global position information to an operator. This research describes a method whereby the operator controls a mobile robot(s) using his finger or stylus via a touchpad or touchscreen interface. Using a mapping between the robot’s operational site and the input device, a human user can provide routing information for the mobile robot. Two algorithms {{have been developed to}} create the robot trajectory from the operator’s input. Information regarding numerous path points is generated when the operator moves his finger/stylus. To prune away meaningless point information, a simple but powerful <b>significant</b> <b>points</b> extracting algorithm is developed. The resulting <b>significant</b> <b>points</b> are used as waypoints. An on-line piecewise cubic Bezier curves (PCBC) trajectory generation algorithm {{is presented to}} create a smooth trajectory for these <b>significant</b> <b>points.</b> As the method is based on distance and not on time, the velocity of mobile robot can be controlled easily within its allowable dynamic range. The PCBC trajectory can also be modified on the fly. Simulation results are presented to verify these newly developed methods...|$|R
