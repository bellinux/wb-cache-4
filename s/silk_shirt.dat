5|$|Voss, an avid motorcyclist, had {{a love of}} {{machinery}} {{that led him to}} consort with his enlisted mechanics, Karl Timms and Christian Rueser; he was even on a first name basis with them. In time, they would transfer squadrons to accompany him. Voss contravened uniform regulations at times and could often be found in the hangar working on his machine beside the mechanics, dressed in a grubby jacket without insignia. His care extended to his craft's exterior; he adorned his Albatros D.III with both a swastika and a heart for good luck. And although he was a casual dresser around his home airfield, when flying he would be well-dressed with a <b>silk</b> <b>shirt</b> beneath his aviation gear. He joked {{that he wanted to be}} presentable to the girls of Paris if he were captured; however, the shirt's silk collar protected his neck from chafing while he swivelled his head about watching for other aircraft during flight.|$|E

Kramer captured Dylan sitting on the stoop of the apartment of his manager, Albert Grossman, located in Gramercy Park, New York, placing Dylan's friend Bob Neuwirth [...] behind Dylan [...] "to give it extra color". Dylan wears a Triumph motorcycle T-shirt under a blue and purple <b>silk</b> <b>shirt,</b> holding his Ray-Ban sunglasses in his right hand. Photographer Kramer commented in 2010 on the singer's expression: [...] "He's hostile, or it's a hostile moodiness. He's almost challenging me or you or whoever's looking at it: 'What are you gonna do about it, buster? ...|$|E

50|$|Gatica {{had given}} away {{thousands}} of dollars to friends. He had tipped away thousands as well. The boxer who walked the streets with a lion cub, wore <b>silk</b> <b>shirts,</b> and diamond rings, was now broke. The cream of Argentina's political and entertainment world now shunned him. The fans who had once cheered him, now forgot him.|$|R
500|$|Welles {{was just}} as heavily made up as young Kane as he was for old Kane, and he often arrived on the set at 2:30a.m. Application of the sculptural make-up for the oldest {{incarnation}} of the character took three-and-a-half hours. The make-up included appliances to age Welles's shoulders, breast and stomach. [...] "In the film and production photographs, {{you can see that}} Kane had a belly that overhung," [...] Seiderman said. [...] "That was not a costume, it was the rubber sculpture that created the image. You could see how Kane's <b>silk</b> <b>shirt</b> clung wetly to the character's body. It could not have been done any other way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jaisimha was a {{right-handed}} batsman who {{was noted}} for his style {{on and off}} the field. He bowled medium pace, often opening the bowling for India, and off-breaks, and was a brilliant fielder. But it was the way he went about things that caught the eye. Partab Ramchand wrote after Jaisimha's death that [...] "his slim figure, which he maintained till his last day, the boyish good looks, the inimitable gait, the trademark <b>silk</b> <b>shirt</b> and scarf, the sleeves buttoned at the wrist or the collar turned up – all these attracted immediate attention." [...] Indian Cricket called him a [...] "cultivated stylist".|$|E
2500|$|The youths, often wearing heavy makeup, would curl {{their hair}} and wear it in long tresses under a small black or red velvet hat {{decorated}} with coins, jewels and gold. Their usual garb consisted of a tiny red embroidered velvet jacket with a gold-embroidered <b>silk</b> <b>shirt,</b> shalvar (baggy trousers), a long skirt and a gilt belt, knotted at the back. They {{were said to be}} [...] "sensuous, attractive, effeminate", and their dancing [...] "sexually provocative". Dancers minced and gyrated their hips in slow vertical and horizontal figure eights, rhythmically snapping their fingers and making suggestive gestures. Often acrobatics, tumbling and mock wrestling were part of the act. The köçeks were available sexually, often to the highest bidder, in the passive role.|$|E
25|$|On the East Coast, {{members of}} the hip hop {{community}} looked back to the gangsters of the 1930s and 1940s for inspiration. Mafioso influences, especially and primarily inspired by the 1983 remake version of Scarface, became popular in hip hop. Many rappers set aside gang-inspired clothing in favor of classic gangster fashions such as bowler hats, double-breasted suits, <b>silk</b> <b>shirts,</b> and alligator-skin shoes ("gators").|$|R

60|$|She {{saw that}} his hands were not in keeping with a Hellenic face. They were thick, {{roughened}} with needle and hot iron and plow-handle. Even in the shop he persisted in his finery. He wore a <b>silk</b> <b>shirt,</b> a topaz scarf, thin tan shoes.|$|E
60|$|The {{bedroom was}} in a state of untidiness which eclipsed {{anything}} which Archie had ever witnessed. The other appeared to be moving house. Bed, furniture, and floor were covered with articles of clothing. A <b>silk</b> <b>shirt</b> wreathed itself about Archie's ankles as he stood gaping, and, as he moved farther into the room, his path was paved with ties and collars.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Newberry wore on {{his short}} {{circular}} person the summer costume {{of a man}} taking his ease and careless of dress: plain white flannel trousers, not worth more than six dollars a leg, an ordinary white <b>silk</b> <b>shirt</b> with a rolled collar, that couldn't have cost more than fifteen dollars, and on his head an ordinary Panama hat, say forty dollars.|$|E
50|$|The Roehampton Cup {{has seen}} some notable holders. In 1911, for example, the trophy was won by Comte Johnnie de Madre's Tigers Team, who wore pure <b>silk</b> <b>shirts,</b> hand {{embroidered}} with gold thread. Lord Rocksavage and Captain J. F.

5000|$|Market basket analysis, {{relates to}} data-mining use in retail sales. If a {{clothing}} store records the purchases of customers, a data mining system could identify those customers who favor <b>silk</b> <b>shirts</b> over cotton ones. Although some explanations of relationships may be difficult, {{taking advantage of}} it is easier. The example deals with association rules within transaction-based data. Not all data are transaction based and logical, or inexact rules may also be present within a database.|$|R

60|$|And {{then with}} the very {{slightest}} of delays these insatiable people picked up again. Mr. Direck slipped away and returned in a white <b>silk</b> <b>shirt,</b> tennis trousers and a belt.

60|$|Denis woke up {{next morning}} to find the sun shining, the sky serene. He decided to wear white flannel {{trousers}}--white flannel trousers and a black jacket, with a <b>silk</b> <b>shirt</b> and his new peach-coloured tie. And what shoes? White was the obvious choice, {{but there was something}} rather pleasing about the notion of black patent leather. He lay in bed for several minutes considering the problem.|$|E
50|$|On one occasion, Wojciechowski chased away {{at gunpoint}} a deputy U.S. Marshal {{who came to}} arrest a friend for {{violation}} of the Mann Act at a party he was attending. The marshal returned with reinforcements, arrested the friend, and confiscated a cache of alcohol and weapons. After the raid, Wojciechowski filed a lawsuit to recover <b>silk</b> <b>shirts</b> and socks that he claimed the marshals had stolen; both the government's charges and the lawsuit came to nothing.|$|R
50|$|During 1880-1890 {{the town}} women mostly wore long skirts or dresses. They were dark red or violet and {{embroidered}} with gold thread. Other {{parts of this}} outfit were the sleeveless waistcoats, <b>silk</b> <b>shirts</b> with wide sleeves embroidered with such a rare finesse. On special occasions they also put on a half-length coat matching {{the color of the}} dress. It was embroidered with various flowery motives. Another beautiful part of the outfit is the silver belt, the silk head kerchief and a great number of jewelry such as earrings, rings, bracelets, necklaces etc.|$|R
50|$|Welling was the {{photographer}} {{of the cover}} art for Sonic Youth's 1985 album Bad Moon Rising. He collaborated with U.S. poet Susan Howe, providing six black-and-white photograms to accompany the text of That This, published in 2010. In 2009 he designed a hand-knotted rug for BravinLee programs. For the spring collection of Italian fashion label Brioni, Welling collaborated with the brand's creative director Brendan Mullane on a triple exposed floral print that was showered over zip front collared jackets, short sleeved <b>silk</b> <b>shirts</b> and Prince of Wales check suits.|$|R
6000|$|At two o'clock, when Ditmar {{returned}} to the office, he called Miss Ottway, who presently came out to summon Janet to his presence. Fresh, immaculate, yet virile in his light suit and <b>silk</b> <b>shirt</b> with red stripes, he was seated at his desk engaged in turning over some papers in a drawer. He kept her waiting a moment, and then said, with apparent casualness:--"Is that you, Miss Bumpus? Would you mind closing the door?" ...|$|E
6000|$|From {{the back}} room he brought an immensely old young man, a quiet sharp-eyed man, in tan <b>silk</b> <b>shirt,</b> checked vest hanging open, and burning brown trousers--Mr. Healey Hanson. Mr. Hanson said only [...] "Yuh?"

60|$|After trying in vain {{to persuade}} him, Jake went away, and soon {{afterwards}} Kenwardine came in. The light was strong and Dick noted the touches of gray in his short, dark hair, but except for this he looked young and athletic. His figure was graceful, his dress picturesque, for he wore white duck with a colored <b>silk</b> <b>shirt</b> and red sash, and he had an easy, good-humored manner. Sitting down close by, he gave Dick a friendly smile.|$|E
60|$|He expounded at length, with firstlies and secondlies and all minor subdivisions of argument, on organization, and order, and civilization. He {{contended that}} the trader was the bearer of civilization, and that the trader must be {{protected}} in his trade else he would not come. Over to the westward were islands which would not protect the traders. What was the result? The traders would not come, and the people were like wild animals. They wore no clothes, no <b>silk</b> <b>shirts</b> (here he peered and blinked significantly at the king), and they ate one another.|$|R
2500|$|By now Vincent and {{his older}} brother Peter were {{beginning}} to make names for themselves in the Bronx. Vincent was the good-looking one, fresh-faced (some newspaper reports would later call him [...] "baby-faced" [...] or endow him with [...] "matinee-idol" [...] looks), with blond, curly hair, a fondness for sharp suits and an enigmatic, menacing air. He spent small fortunes on his clothes, which were stashed with various girlfriends across Manhattan and the Bronx. He favored tailored suits, <b>silk</b> <b>shirts,</b> double-breasted Chesterfield overcoats and his signature hat, a pearl-grey fedora, always worn at a rakish angle.|$|R
50|$|Narcoculture glorifies the {{individual}} and his achievements, wealth, and masculinity. Narcos live luxurious lifestyles and display their wealth by wearing expensive clothing. There are regional differences in the styles of dress, the northern cities closest to the border are influenced by American styles of dress and brands. The clothing is gender-conscious, {{where men and women}} wear distinct fashion items pertaining to their gender. In most Mexican cities, there are men wearing piteado belts, cowboy boots made of exotic animal skin, <b>silk</b> <b>shirts</b> and cowboy hats or baseball caps; thus, some narcos have cast aside the cowboy or Northern style to wear expensive designer clothes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't have a man," [...] {{declared}} Mrs. Cassidy, [...] "that didn't {{beat me up}} {{at least}} once a week. Shows he thinks something of you. Say! but that last dose Jack gave me wasn't no homeopathic one. I can see stars yet. But he'll be the sweetest man in town {{for the rest of the}} week to make up for it. This eye is good for theater tickets and a <b>silk</b> <b>shirt</b> waist at the very least." ...|$|E

60|$|For instance, this {{afternoon}} on the poop. Let me describe it. Here was Miss West, in a crisp duck sailor suit, immaculately white, open at the throat, where, under the broad collar, was knotted a man-of-war black silk neckerchief. Her smooth-groomed hair, a trifle rebellious in the breeze, was glorious. And here was I, in white ducks, white shoes, and white <b>silk</b> <b>shirt,</b> as immaculate and well-tended as she. The steward was just bringing the pretty tea-service for Miss West, and in the background Wada hovered.|$|E

Under {{the terms of the}} deal, Workers for Freedom would be promoted across North America by GFT. It was also reported that Workers for Freedom had produced another 10 tiger-print <b>silk</b> <b>shirts</b> for Paul McCartney's world tour (to add to the 40 or 50 in his collection) and it had some copyright cases to pursue, with The Times noting that: [...] "The pirating of Worker's sic stylish appliquė shirts has become an industry sport".|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Kiss FM Kenya, director Daps revealed the inspiration behind {{the concept of the}} viral music video: [...] "The concept came about from the title really. 'Bad' is good looking so we needed pretty ladies and 'boujee' is stuck up so we needed them to play that part. I like having juxtapositions in my videos as it makes the art stand out. The contrast between these ladies dressed in high fashion but having them in regular environments grasped me. Then it was about adding in little elements after that — the doves, the noodles, ace of spades, <b>silk</b> <b>shirts</b> on a dirt bike." ...|$|R
5000|$|Terry [...] "Machine Gun" [...] Druggan (1903 - March 4, 1954) was an Irish-American mobster {{and leader}} of the Chicago based mob - the Valley Gang during prohibition. Druggan was well known {{throughout}} the Chicago area as a tough street fighter. In 1919, Terry Druggan took over the Valley Gang. Druggan was a dwarf-like little man with a hair trigger temper and a lisp. Druggan was ambitious and found the Valley territory too restrictive for his high ambitions and soon extended his criminal reach far beyond its borders. By 1924, Terry Druggan could truthfully boast that even the lowest member of his gang wore <b>silk</b> <b>shirts</b> and had chauffeurs for their new Rolls Royce.|$|R
