50|$|For {{portable}} 1 litre bottles, {{the head}} of the siphon bottle is removed for filling. A rubber seal and tube are also removed. Then about 1 litre of very cold water is added to the bottle; the bottle is not completely filled. The rubber <b>seal,</b> <b>tube,</b> and head are then reassembled. An 8-gram CO2 charger is inserted and securely screwed into a port in the head; the port has a conical seal and a hollow pin that pierces the charger and lets the gas into the bottle. When the sound of the gas bubbling into the water is heard, the bottle is shaken, then left to rest. Within seconds, the trigger pull will release seltzer water.|$|E

On the basis of this result, the continuous treatment system was designed and tested, and then its possibility of the practical application in the MSW incineration plant was investigated. The destruction efficiency of PCDD and PCDF in EP ash depended on the conditions of temperature and residual time. It was confirmed that in this equipment almost 100 % destruction was obtained at about 500 ℃ and for a few minutes...|$|E

The liquid-filled <b>sealed</b> <b>tube</b> is stamped in a conventional die to form the tube into a desired configuration, such as a box-shaped structural member. The compressive forces produced as the die closes to form stamped tube also compress the liquid within {{the interior of the}} <b>sealed</b> <b>tube</b> as it changes shape. Thus, the pressure of the liquid increases as the die closes. As the liquid resists compression, it forces the tube walls outwardly toward the interior surface of the die cavity. Once die sections are fully closed around the <b>sealed</b> <b>tube,</b> the tube walls take the shape of the die cavity.|$|R

In this study we tested the MICADAS (mini radiocarbon dating system [1]) radiocarbon measurements of targets prepared by <b>sealed</b> <b>tube</b> graphitization process. We found the optimal iron catalyst and reagents (TiH 2 and Zn) amount whereby we can reach a relatively low background level, and minimized the overall δ 13 C fractionation during the graphitization. Repeated measurements of normalization standards and real samples with known 14 C activities were very well reproduced.

In this paper, effects of tube voltage (kVp) on propa-gation-based phase-contrast imaging have been investigated with two types of microfocus x-ray <b>tubes,</b> a conventional <b>sealed</b> x-ray <b>tube</b> with the focal spot size of 13 - 20 μm and an open x-ray tube with minimum focal spot size less than 2 μm.

Two different phenomena were observed for the two x-ray tubes. For the open tube, phase-contrast effect has a slight drop with the increasing of tube voltage, however, it is opposite for the <b>sealed</b> <b>tube.</b> A further investigation indicates that the variation of focal spot size causes the abnor-mal result for the <b>sealed</b> <b>tube.</b> It also shows that phase-contrast effect is more sensitive to focal spot size than tube vol-tage...|$|R
